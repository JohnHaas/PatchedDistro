Mr. Sardonicus

Mr. Sardonicus (1961) is a horror film produced and directed by William Castle. It tells the story of Sardonicus, a man whose face becomes frozen in a horrifying grin while robbing his father's grave to obtain a winning lottery ticket. Castle cited the film in his memoir as one of his favorites to produce.
Plot summary.
In 1880 in the fictional central European country of Gorslava, prominent London physician Sir Robert Cargrave (Ronald Lewis) has come to the mysterious Baron Sardonicus (Guy Rolfe) at the urgent request of his one-time love, Maude (Audrey Dalton), now the Baron's wife. Sir Robert becomes apprehensive when his enquiries about Sardonicus are met with fear. When Sir Robert arrives at Castle Sardonicus, his fears are quickly justified: one of his first sights is that of Sardonicus' servant Krull (Oskar Homolka, credited as "Oscar Homolka") torturing one of the Baron's servants by placing leeches on her face.
Maude herself is fearful of what will happen if Sir Robert is not willing to do as Sardonicus asks of him. Even Krull is not immune to the Baron's cruelty as he is missing an eye, thanks to Sardonicus's anger. 
Sardonicus tells Sir Robert his story. Once he was Marek Toleslawski, a farmer like his father Henryk (Vladimir Sokoloff). Marek and his wife Elenka (Erika Peters) live a humble life, but Elenka and Henryk want more: he buys a ticket for the national lottery. Henryk dies in his sleep that night. Marek and Elenka learn that the ticket is a winner but can only claim the prize if they have the ticket, which was buried with Henryk. Elenka presses Marek to retrieve the ticket so he can, as she says, prove his love to her. Marek opens the grave and is horrified to see his father's skull seemingly grinning at him but, after screaming, running away, and coming back, retrieves the ticket. When he returns home, he and Elenka realize something is wrong: Marek cannot speak. Elenka lights a candle and sees Marek's face contorted into a fixed terrifying grin, similar to Henryk's skull. The prize money allows Marek to buy a title and castle; but Elenka commits suicide soon after seeing his face for the first time, so she cannot share the riches with him. Marek renames himself "Sardonicus" (after the medical term Risus sardonicus, Latin for "sardonic smile", used for tetanus victims) and learns to speak all over again with the help of some of the greatest diction experts in the world. His own experiments on young women were to find a cure for his condition, but he has had no success. Since Sardonicus's new wife Maude had mentioned Sir Robert as a great doctor specializing in paralysis, he had hoped Sir Robert would help restore his face. (He had tried several other great doctors before, with no success). Sir Robert agrees to try.
Sir Robert's efforts at restoring Sardonicus's face have no effect. Sardonicus demands he try new and experimental treatments and, when Sir Robert refuses, threatens to mutilate Maude's face to match his own. Sir Robert sends for equipment and supplies, including a deadly South American plant which he uses to experiment on dogs. When Sardonicus then has Maude and Sir Robert see the open upright coffin of Henryk Toleslawski which he'd had brought to the castle, Sir Robert conceives an idea: he will inject Sardonicus with a diluted plant extract, then recreate the event that led to Sardonicus' condition. Though Sardonicus is skeptical, he agrees. The injection is made, the room darkened, and a light shined on the skull. Sardonicus screams in agony, imagining Henryk's flesh has been restored. Sir Robert comes into the room to find Sardonicus' face is back to normal, though Sir Robert advises him to not speak until his facial muscles have had time to adjust. The Baron writes a note to Maude annulling their marriage, and a note to Sir Robert, asking his fee. Sir Robert tells Sardonicus, "You owe me nothing", and Sardonicus lets them both go. 
At the train station for the trip back to London, Sir Robert and Maude are confronted by a frightened Krull, who tells them Sardonicus not only cannot speak, he cannot open his jaw or lips at all. They must return and help him. But Sir Robert tells Krull that the injection was only water, that the plant extract would have been lethal even in a small dose. What happened was all psychological, and once Sardonicus realizes that, he will be all right and able to speak and eat.
The story resumes with Krull returning to the castle, and lying to the Baron, telling him that he just missed Sir Robert (presumedly Krull's revenge for Sardonicus's cruelty to him). This dooms Sardonicus to death by starvation, while Krull cruelly sits down to eat his lavish dinner in front of the Baron.
Production.
The film is based on a short story called "Sardonicus" that was originally published in "Playboy". Castle purchased the rights and hired its author, Ray Russell, to write the screenplay.
To achieve Sardonicus's terrible grin, actor Guy Rolfe was subjected to five separate facial appliance fittings. He could not physically stand to wear the piece for more than an hour at a time. As a result the full make-up is only shown in a few scenes, with Rolfe instead wearing a kerchief over the lower half of his face for most of the running time.
Castle claimed that, at the behest of Columbia Pictures, he shot a second ending for the film in which Sardonicus is cured and survives (although co-star Audrey Dalton claims no such ending was ever shot). Castle, with his reputation as the "king of gimmicks" to market his films, built the marketing for the film around the idea of the two possible endings. Audiences were given the opportunity to participate in the "Punishment Poll". Each movie patron was given a glow-in-the-dark card featuring a hand with the thumb out. At the appropriate time they voted by holding up the card with either the thumb up or down as to whether Sardonicus would live or die. Legend has it no audience ever offered mercy so the alternate ending – if in fact one existed – was never screened. 
The "poll" scene, as presented in the film, is hosted by Castle himself, and he is shown pretending to address the audience, jovially egging them on to choose punishment, and "tallying" the poll results with no break in continuity as the "punishment" ending is pronounced the winner. The "punishment" ending occupies only three minutes of film after the "poll", and was the ending of the original Ray Russell short story. Given that Turner Classic Movies was unable to locate any cut of the film which included the "merciful" ending, the suggestion of alternative endings itself appears to have been an elaborate conceit on the part of Castle in service of the "gimmick".
Critical response.
"The PTA Magazine" described "Mr. Sardonicus" as an "elaborately produced ... that evokes disgust as well as macabre thrills". "The New York Times" sharply disagreed. While praising Lewis's performance, the "Times" stated that Castle "is not Edgar Allan Poe. Anybody naive enough to attend...will find painful proof".
Cultural impact.
The US television series "Wiseguy" incorporated the film into a story arc about a rich factory owner in Washington State who was fixated on the film and had comparable emotional issues. He was cured by re-enacting the film's ending. Noted film critic Jeffrey Lyons played himself explaining the film's psychological subtext to FBI agents on the case.

Organic nonlinear optical materials

Organic materials are expected to have relatively strong nonlinear optical properties due to delocalized electrons at formula_1* orbitals. This expectation explains extensive search for better NLO materials among organic crystals. 
L-arginine maleate dihydrate (LAMD).
L-Arginine is one of the essential amino acids widely
distributed in biological substances. It forms a number of salts with organic and inorganic acids showing non-linear optical properties. L-Arginine maleate dihydrate (LAMD, C6H14N4O2,C4H4O4,2H2O) is one of these L-arginine salts which is a complex of strongly basic
amino acid, carboxylic acid and provides useful information
in relation to molecular interaction in present day biological
systems and to prebiotic self-organisms. It is also a nonlinear optical material with second harmonic generation efficiency 1.68 times that of KDP. 
LAMD crystals are grown from solution by solvent evaporation; they belong to the triclinic space group P1. 
L-methionine L-methioninium hydrogen maleate (LMMM).
LMMM too belongs to the amino acid family. Crystals are grown by slow evaporation of an aqueous solution containing L-methionine and maleic acid, resulting in centimeter-large crystals of a non-centrosymmetric space group. They were applied for second harmonic generation of an laser (wavelength 1064 nm), and SHG efficiency equal to that of KDP has been obtained.

Enforcement Act of 1870

The Enforcement Act of 1870, also known as the Civil Rights Act of 1870 or First Ku Klux Klan Act, or Force Act was an United States federal law written to empower the President with the legal authority to enforce the first section of the Fifteenth Amendment throughout the United States. The act was the first of three Enforcement Acts passed by the United States Congress from 1870 to 1871 during the Reconstruction Era to combat attacks on the suffrage rights of African Americans from state officials or violent groups like the Ku Klux Klan. 
The bill H.R. 1293 was first introduced into the House by Republican John Bingham from Ohio on February 21, 1870, but not discussed until May 16, 1870. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill S. 810 grew from several different bills from various Senators. The first proposed bill was submitted to the Senate in February 1870 by Sen. George F. Edmunds from Vermont followed by Sen. Oliver P. Morton from Indiana, Sen. Charles Sumner from Massachusetts, and Sen. William Stewart from Nevada. After three months of rewriting in the Committee on the Judiciary, the final version of the bill was introduced onto the Senate floor on April 19, 1870. The act was passed by Congress in May 1870 and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on May 31, 1870.
The Enforcement Act of 1870 prohibited discrimination by state officials in voter registration on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It established penalties for interfering with a person’s right to vote and gave federal courts the power to enforce the act. The act also authorized the President to employ the use of the army to uphold the act and the use of federal marshals to bring charges against offenders for election fraud, the bribery or intimidation of voters, and conspiracies to prevent citizens from exercising their constitutional rights.

Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware

Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware (MBAM) is an application for computers running under the Microsoft Windows operating system that finds and removes malware. Made by Malwarebytes Corporation, it was first released in January 2008. It is available in a free version, which scans for and removes malware when started manually, and a paid version, which additionally provides scheduled scans, real-time protection and a flash memory scanner. Starting with version 1.75, MBAM scans files contained within archive files.
Overview.
MBAM claims to find malware that many other anti-virus and anti-spyware programs miss, including rogue security software, adware, and spyware. MBAM scans in batch mode, rather than scanning all files opened, reducing interference if on-demand anti-malware software is also running on the computer.
MBAM is available in both a free and a paid version. The free version can be run by the user when required. The paid version can perform scheduled scans, automatically scan files when opened, block IP addresses of malicious web sites, and quickly scan only open services, programs and device drivers.
MBAM is available with a user interface in many languages. A Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit program (beta v1.01.0.1021 ) and a startup manager are available for download. 
Dispute with IObit.
On November 2, 2009, Malwarebytes accused rival IObit of incorporating the database of Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware (and several products from other vendors, which were not named) in its security software IObit Security 360. IObit denied the accusation and stated that the database is based on user submissions, and sometimes the same signature names that are in Malwarebytes get placed in the results. They said they did not have time to filter out the signature names that are similar to Malwarebytes. IObit also stated that Malwarebytes does not have convincing proof, and promised that the databases were not stolen. After the declaration from IObit, Malwarebytes replied that they are not convinced of the argument from IObit. Malwarebytes claims to have served DMCA infringement notices against CNET, Download.com and MajorGeeks.com in order to have the download sites remove the IObit software. IObit said that as of version 1.3, their database has been updated to address those accusations of intellectual property theft made earlier by Malwarebytes.

<doc id="19476471" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19476471" title="Electrician and Mechanic">
Electrician and Mechanic

Electrician and Mechanic was an American science and technology magazine published from 1890 to January 1914 when it merged with "Modern Electrics" to become Modern Electrics & Mechanics. In July 1914, incorporated with Popular Electricity and the World's Advance and the title became "Popular Electricity and Modern Mechanics". The new publisher, Modern Publishing, began a series of magazine mergers and title changes so numerous that librarians began to complain. In October 1915 the title became " Popular Science Monthly" and the magazine is still published under that name today.
Origin.
"Bubier's Popular Electrician" (founded 1890) was acquired by Frank R. Fraprie and the newly formed Sampson Publishing Company in May 1906. The name was changed to "Electrician & Mechanic" with the July issue. The editors were Frank Fraprie, Arthur Eugene Watson and Mary Otis Sampson. Sampson was also the treasurer and director of the publishing company. (Fraprie and Sampson were married in 1911.)
By 1912, "Electrician and Mechanic" had absorbed three other magazines; "Amateur Work", "Building Craft" and "Collins Wireless Bulletin". The magazine typically had about 100 pages and each issue covered a wide variety of topics in electricity, wireless radio, machining, mechanical drawing, wood working and chemistry. There were articles for radio technicians such as "The Calculation of Inductance" that details how to design and wind coils for a wireless telegraphy set. A skilled machinist might read about "The Production of Accurate Screw-Threads in a Lathe". There were also articles for the hobbyist readers. Woodworkers could find plans for an armchair or a simple letter box.
Mergers.
Hugo Gernsback's Electro Importing Company catalogs had elaborate instructions on how to use the electrical and radio parts they sold. These catalogs spawned "Modern Electrics" in April 1908 and the magazine had over 100,000 readers by 1911. In March 1913, Gernsback sold the magazine and the Modern Publishing Company to his business partner, Orland Ridenour. Modern Publishing acquired "Electrician and Mechanic" and merged it with "Modern Electrics". The new magazine, "Modern Electrics and Mechanics", was published from January 1914 to June 1914. Gernsback started a new magazine, "The Electrical Experimenter", in May 1913.
Popular Electricity Publishing of Chicago merged "Popular Electricity in Plain English" (founded May 1908) with "World's Advance" in September 1913. Modern Publishing acquired "Popular Electricity and World's Advance" and combined it with "Modern Electrics and Mechanics" in July 1914. The new magazine was "Popular Electricity and Modern Mechanics" but it soon changed the title to "Modern Mechanics" and was "World's Advance" by April 1915.
The numerous title changes were a topic of discussion in library journals of the time. Libraries would have individual magazines bound into books. A typical size magazine would be bound into volumes every six months, magazine publishers would normally change titles or merge magazines on these volume boundaries. This was not the case with Modern Publishing. The following editorial appeared in the April 1915 "Bulletin of Bibliography".
"World's Advance" had a readership of 135,000 "men" by 1915. A notice in a trade publication for advertisers stated, "72% of its readers are over 21 years old and it is exclusively a man's publication without waste circulation among women and children."
"Popular Science Monthly".
"Popular Science Monthly" was founded in May 1872 by Edward L. Youmans. It was a science and technology magazine equivalent to "Scientific American" or "Science". James McKeen Cattell became the editor in 1900 and the publisher in 1901. Cattell had a background in academics and continued publishing articles for educated readers. By 1915 the readership was declining and publishing a science journal was a financial challenge. In a September 1915 editorial, Cattell related these difficulties to his readers and that the journal had been "transferred" to a group that wanted the name for a general audience magazine. Next month the subscribers would be receive a new journal titled "Scientific Monthly" that would continue the academic tradition. "Scientific Monthly" was published until 1958 when it was absorbed into "Science".
The new owners were Henry Fisher, Robert Wilson and Oliver Capen of Modern Publishing. The October 1915 issue was titled "Popular Science Monthly and World's Advance". The volume number (Vol. 87, No. 4) was that of "Popular Science" but the content was that of "World's Advance". The new editor was Waldemar Kaempffert, a former editor of "Scientific American"
The change in "Popular Science Monthly" was dramatic. The old version was a scholarly journal that had eight to ten articles in a 100 page issue. There would be ten to twenty photographs or illustrations. The new version had hundreds of short, easy to read articles with hundreds of illustrations. Editor Kaembffert was writing for "the home craftsman and hobbyist who wanted to know something about the world of science." The circulation doubled in the first year.
"Popular Science Monthly" was two different magazines for during the last half of 1915 and this presented a dilemma for librarians who needed to have them bound into book volumes. The library journal, "Bulletin of Bibliography", printed the conflicting recommendations received from the new and old publishers. The journal editor promised to publish a "list of librarians and book-binders who have gone to Battle Creek to recuperate."
Title changes.

Chinese encyclopedia

Chinese encyclopedias are encyclopedias published in the Chinese language or encyclopedias about China and Chinese-related topics. The origin of encyclopedias in China can be traced to the late Han dynasty, circa 220 CE. Chinese has two words for "encyclopedia, encyclopedic", common "baike" () and literary "dadian" (). For example, "baike quanshu" (百科全書 "hundred subjects complete book") "comprehensive encyclopedia" and "Yongle dadian" (永樂大典 'Yongle [Emperor's] great canon) "Yongle Encyclopedia". Encyclopedic works were published in China for well over one and a half thousand years before China's first modern encyclopedias were published after China's economic liberalization in the 1980s, during the reform period. Several encyclopedias have been published in China since then, including several specialist and children's encyclopedias. The major title currently available - in both paper and online versions - is the "Encyclopedia of China" (中国大百科全书 "Zhōngguó Dà Bǎikē Quánshū"), published by Encyclopedia of China Publishing House.
Since the 21st century, with internet use proliferating, a number of online encyclopedias have been started. The three largest online Chinese encyclopedias are Hudong, Baidu Baike and Chinese Wikipedia.
History.
The history of encyclopedias in China is distinctive and covers almost two thousand years. Traditional Chinese encyclopedias differ from the modern encyclopedia in that they are mainly anthologies of significant literature with some aspects of the dictionary. Compiled by eminent scholars, they have been revised rather than replaced over hundreds of years.
Earliest compendium of the kind was the "Lüshi Chunqiu" (3 c. BCE). However, the Song dynasty scholar Wang Yinglin :zh:王應麟 (1223-1296) names the "Huang lan" :zh:皇覽 of the Three Kingdoms (3 c. CE, now lost) to be the first encyclopedia. Among the most prominent in the imperial history are the Tang dynasty "Tongdian" and the Ming "Yongle Encyclopedia". The Tang precedent was followed by creation of large imperial compendia known as the Ten Universals :zh:十通.

Though not technically Chinese encyclopedias because they are not written in Chinese, there have been many specialist works in other languages that have focused on China itself as a subject. These include:

Ob(Servant)

Ob (Servant) is the fourth studio album by Australian technical death metal band Psycroptic. It was released on 26 September 2008 by Nuclear Blast.
Critical reception.
Alex Henderson of Allmusic praised the band's musicianship, saying that "in fact, is a crucial part of the equation on "Ob (Servant)"" and "technical is definitely the operative word where Psycroptic are concerned". However, he criticised the release, stating: "the material isn't remarkable, but it is noteworthy" and defined the album with: "although not stunning, certainly doesn't suffer from a lack of musicianship or technical prowess".

Silver trifluoromethanesulfonate

Silver trifluoromethanesulfonate, or silver triflate is the triflate salt of silver. Since the triflate anion is weakly coordinating, it is useful as a halide abstraction reagent. This is similar to other silver salts, e.g. the tetrafluoroborate and the hexafluorophosphate. It is useful in activating sulfur protecting groups at the anomeric centres of carbohydrates, in presence of iodine/NIS.

Maqsurah

Maqsurah (Arabic مقصورة) (literally “closed-off space”), an enclosure, a box or wooden screen near the Mihrab or the center of the qibla wall, which was originally designed to shield a worshiping ruler from assassins. The imam officiating inside the maqsurah typically belonged to the same school of law to which the ruler belonged.
There also may have been some spiritual connotation similar to the chancel screen in churches. They were often wooden screens decorated with carvings or interlocking turned pieces of wood (mashrabiyya).
Historically, it was first innovated by Muawiyah I, Umayyad caliph, in Umayyad Mosque. The Companions Mihrab belonged to the Maqsura of the Companions.

Coyote Creek State Park

Coyote Creek State Park is a state park of New Mexico, United States, preserving a riparian canyon in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The park is located north of Mora. Coyote Creek is the most densely stocked trout stream in New Mexico.
Geography.
Coyote Creek, a tributary of the Mora River, flows almost due south through Guadalupita Canyon. An ridge called La Mesa rises to in elevation above the park to the east, and to the west is the Rincon subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The park is located in the eastern foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains at an altitude of . There is an average precipitation of per year and an average annual temperature of . Summer temperatures reaching are unusual, though winters are severe with subzero temperatures and heavy snow. The average annual flow of Coyote Creek is about .
Geology.
The oldest rocks visible in Coyote Creek State Park were deposited during the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian between 320 and 250 million years ago. In a geosyncline at the edge of a great shallow sea, limestone formed underwater is intermixed with sandstone and shale eroded from mountains to the west. The sea retreated and advanced several times and the mountains eventually eroded away. 70 million years ago the Laramide orogeny uplifted the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, steeply tilting the earlier sediments down to the east. New mountain sediments formed a vast alluvial plain. 8 million years ago a series of volcanic eruptions took place to the east, forming the Ocate volcanic field. The top of the basalt flows was higher than the bottom of Guadalupita Canyon is today. Canyons gradually carved into the lava flows were inundated with more basalt by later eruptions, creating a reverse stratigraphy where newer deposits are below older deposits. Guadalupita Canyon was carved during the Pleistocene epoch when there were small glaciers in the mountains to the west. The creekbed initially shifted eastward following the eroding edge of the basalt. Upon hitting the softer Pennsylvanian sediments, however, the creek began carving downward, creating a valley with a steep east wall and a more gradual slope to the west.
Flora and fauna.
The riparian zone along the creek is dominated by coyote willow with some narrowleaf cottonwood and chokecherry intermixed. East of the creek are wet meadows followed by a ponderosa pine forest with an understory of Gambel oak. On the west side of the park is a conifer forest of Douglas fir, limber pine, blue spruce, Engelmann spruce, bristlecone pine, white fir, and quaking aspen, again with a Gambel oak understory. Species diversity is lower at the north and south ends of the park. Coyote Creek State Park is known for its wildflowers, such as geraniums, sunflowers, irises, and primroses.
Mammals known to inhabit the immediate area include black bears, cougars, elk, mule deer, red and gray foxes, bobcats, coyotes, skunks, and porcupines. Beavers have created small pools along the creek with their dams. These ponds have benefited the game fish, which include rainbow trout, brown trout, Rio Grande cutthroat trout, and white suckers. Numerous bird species have been identified in the park, and the endangered southwestern subspecies of the willow flycatcher nests and breeds along Coyote Creek.
History.
The Coyote Creek area was inhabited by Native Americans for centuries, although no significant archaeological sites have been found within the park. Settlement by Euro-Americans began in 1837 when three residents of Taos received a community land grant from the Mexican government. The Coyote Creek valley was farmed and many sections were held as community property. With the annexation of New Mexico by the United States in 1846, the grant only narrowly succeeded in being honored. However Stephen Benton Elkins and Thomas B. Catron began buying up community lands, so in defense the residents of Guadalupita divided up and privatized the remaining common parcels in 1889.
In the early 1930s many of the parcels were consolidated into a ranch owned by Eusebio Romero. A ranch house and the remains of a moonshine shack from this era are still visible in the park. In the late 1960s, as a new owner bought up the ranch, surveyed as prime state park material were set aside. This property was purchased by the state on April 24, 1969 for $16,000. The park maintains an official arrangement with an acequia of landowners downstream. Coyote Creek State Park was greatly expanded in size in 2004 with the purchase and donation of by The Trust for Public Land.
Recreation.
Coyote Creek State Park is open year-round, with most visitors coming to fish, hike, camp, and picnic. A trail circles through the park, crossing the creek twice.

Trechnotheria

Trechnotheria is a group of mammals that includes the therians and some fossil mammals from the Mesozoic Era. In the Jurassic through Cretaceous periods, the group was endemic to what would be Asia and Africa
Trechnotheria has been assigned various ranks, but was originally called a "superlegion" by the original author.
One reference has defined the Trechnotheria as the clade comprising the last common ancestor of "Zhangheotherium" and living therian mammals, and all its descendants.
Characteristics.
Like most Mesozoic mammal groups, early trechnotherians are known mainly from their teeth. Hence, one of most prominent features of this group is the "hypertrophied postvallum/prevallid shearing mechanism", along with other dental characters. Features of the shoulder blade, tibia, humerus, and ankle joint also diagnose this clade.

Charles Macfaull

Charles Macfaull (1800 – 13 Dec 1846) was an early settler in the Swan River Colony, now Western Australia. He arrived in Western Australia in 1830, and is credited with having planted the colony's first vineyard, using vines brought from the Cape of Good Hope. He worked as the colony's postmaster, and in 1833 he established the colony's first successful newspaper, the "Perth Gazette and Western Australian Times", which survives today as "The West Australian".
The original printing press, a tiny Ruthven press, that was used to prepare the first paper is currently housed in the Fremantle Museum.
He was the subject of the first book ever printed in Western Australia. Entitled "A report of the late trial for libel !!! : Clarke versus Macfaul, 4 September 1835", it gives William Nairn Clark's account of his successful libel suit against Macfaull.
Macfaull died on 13 December 1846 in Perth, the Colony of Western Australia. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, who took on the ongoing role of publishing the "Perth Gazette".

Jenna Bush Hager

Jenna Welch Bush Hager (born Jenna Welch Bush, November 25, 1981) is the younger of the sororal twin daughters of the 43rd U.S. President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush, and a granddaughter of the 41st U.S. President George H. W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush. She and her sister Barbara were the first twin children of a U.S. president. Hager is an author, an editor-at-large for "Southern Living" magazine, a special correspondent for NBC's "Today Show" and a contributor to NBC Nightly News .
Early life and education.
Hager was named after her maternal grandmother, Jenna Hawkins Welch. She was educated at several primary and secondary schools. In Dallas, Texas, she and her sister attended Preston Hollow Elementary School and then The Hockaday School. In 1994, after her father was elected Governor of Texas and the family moved to Austin, Texas, Bush was a student at St. Andrew's Episcopal School, and attended Austin High School from 1996 until her graduation in 2000.
She attended the University of Texas at Austin and took summer classes at New York University. She was a legacy member of Kappa Alpha Theta, both her mother's and twin sister's sorority. While there, Jenna and her sister Barbara made national headlines when they were both arrested for alcohol-related charges twice within 5 weeks: on April 29, 2001, Jenna was charged with a misdemeanor for possession of alcohol under the age 21 in Austin. On May 29, 2001, Jenna was charged with another misdemeanor—attempting to use a fake ID (with the name "Barbara Pierce", her paternal grandmother's maiden name) to purchase alcohol. She pleaded no contest to both charges. Jenna Bush graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in English in 2004.
2004 U.S. presidential election.
She had asked her father not to run for president in 2000: "Oh, I just wish you wouldn't run. It's going to change our life." Her father told her that he and her mother needed to live their lives. In the winter of 2003, however, she decided to become involved in the 2004 campaign. In response to this decision, she made media appearances during the summer of 2004 prior to the election. She and her sister made several joint public appearances, including giving a speech to the Republican Convention on August 31, 2004. She made headlines when she was found sticking her tongue out to media photographers at a campaign stop in St. Louis. Hager and Barbara took turns traveling to swing states with their father and also gave a seven-page interview and photo shoot in "Vogue". The media also extensively covered the campaigning of John Kerry's daughters Vanessa and Alexandra, making the "battle of the daughters" a human interest element of the campaign.
Career.
Teaching.
Before leaving Washington, D.C. in Summer 2006, Hager worked at Elsie Whitlow Stokes Community Freedom Public Charter School for a year and a half as a teacher's aide. She took a leave of absence from the Charter School teaching position to work at a shelter as part of an internship for UNICEF's Educational Policy Department in Latin America, specifically in Panama. After her internship for UNICEF, Hager returned to her position at the charter school in Washington, D.C. She currently works as a part-time reading coordinator at the SEED Public Charter School in Baltimore, Maryland, and contributes a monthly news story about education for the "Today" show.
Writing.
In 2007, Hager began marketing a book proposal with the assistance of Robert B. Barnett, a Washington attorney. The title of the book is "" and it chronicles her experiences working with UNICEF sponsored charities in Latin America, including visits to drought stricken Paraguay in 2006, while working as an intern for United Nations Children's Fund. HarperCollins announced in March 2007 it would publish the book and it was released September 28, 2007, with an initial printing of 500,000 copies. Her share of the profits will go to UNICEF; the remainder will go to the woman whose life is the basis of the book, assisting in the young woman's continuing education. During the book tour, Hager appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"; during the interview Hager telephoned her parents. Hager wrote a second book, in conjunction with her mother, which is designed to encourage children to read. The book, entitled "Read All About It!", was published on April 22, 2008, also by HarperCollins.
On November 26, 2012, Hager was named editor-at-large of "Southern Living" magazine.
NBC News correspondent.
In August 2009, NBC hired Hager as a new correspondent for the morning television show "Today". Her role is to contribute stories about once a month on issues such as education. On April 19, 2010, Hager interviewed former President Bill Clinton and discussed Haiti and his daughter Chelsea's upcoming marriage.
She also helps out with NBC News's Education Nation segments on all platforms of NBC and fills-in as co-anchor and "Orange Room anchor" on "Today". She is also a contributor and a substitute anchor on NBC Nightly News.
Personal life.
On August 15, 2007, Henry Chase Hager proposed to Jenna Bush on Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park in Maine after getting permission from her father. They met during her father's 2004 presidential campaign.
Their relationship became public when the two appeared together at a White House dinner for The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall in November 2005. Henry Hager attended St. Christopher's School in Richmond, Virginia, and holds an MBA from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia. He worked as a U.S. Department of Commerce aide for Carlos Gutierrez and as a White House aide for Karl Rove. He is the son of former Virginia Republican Party Chairman John H. Hager, who previously served as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and as the U.S. Department of Education Assistant Secretary under George W. Bush. The wedding took place during a private ceremony on May 10, 2008, at her parents' Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, Texas. On June 21, 2008, President Bush hosted a wedding reception for Jenna and Henry at the White House. The guests included many Republicans, such as Condoleezza Rice. The United States Marine Band performed.
On December 12, 2012, Henry and Jenna Hager announced on the "The Today Show" that they were expecting their first child. Their daughter, Margaret Laura "Mila" Hager, was born on April 13, 2013, in New York City. Mila is named after her grandmothers.

Victorian Trades Hall

Victorian Trades Hall is a Trades Hall building located in the suburb of Carlton, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and home to the Victorian Trades Hall Council.
It is located on the corner of Lygon Street and Victoria Street, just north of the Melbourne central business district.
The original Trades Hall was opened in May 1859 after being built by workers as an organising place for the labour movement in Melbourne. The workers financed the construction of the building themselves. The hall underwent an upgrade from 1874 to 1925 at the hands of architectural firm Reed & Barnes and it remains one of the most historically important sites in Melbourne today, being classified by the National Trust and included in the Register of Historic Buildings (Victoria).
The hall is located across the road from the eight hour day monument which was erected to honour the Victorian workers who won the first 8 hour working day in the world in 1856. It is the birthplace of organisations like the Victorian Labor Party and Australian Council of Trade Unions.
Four flags fly from the roof of the building; the Australian Flag, the Eureka Flag, the Australian Aboriginal flag, and the red flag.
Trades Hall is home to many of the Victorian trade unions and left-wing political parties. It also serves as the headquarters of the National Union of Students. The various rooms of the hall can be hired out for functions, meetings or conferences and it is often used for theatrical productions and to display artwork. The hall has a bar which is patronised by trade union members and political activists and a bookshop which sells political texts.
In recent times, as well as being the centre for union activity, the Trades Hall Council has opened the Trades Hall building to many cultural events, plays, and concerts including the Melbourne Comedy Festival - concentrating on political and 'on the edge' performances.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Marshall Islands

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has had a presence in the Marshall Islands since 1977, and currently claims a membership of 4,486, or approximately 7.5% of the country's population.
First missionaries, convert, and congregation.
The first Mormon missionaries in the Marshall Islands were William Wardel and Steven Cooper, who arrived on 3 February 1977. Misao Lokeijak was the first person in the Marshall Islands to become a member of the LDS Church. Lokeijak was baptized in 1977, shortly after Mormon missionaries first arrived in Majuro. Lokeijak had previously been introduced to Mormonism in Hawaii. 
On 11 May 1978, the Laura Branch of the church was created and Lokeijak was made the first branch president in the Marshall Islands.
Church growth.
At the end of 1977, there were 27 members of the LDS Church in the Marshall Islands. By the end of 1979, there were 177. In 1984, there were enough members to justify the construction of two meetinghouses, one in Laura and one in Rita. The meetinghouse in Laura was dedicated on 13 January 1986 and the one in Rita on 14 January. In 1987, the Majuro District (of the Micronesia Guam Mission) was organized with five constituent branches. By 1990, there were over 1000 members of the church in the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands Majuro Mission was created in 2006 and the first stake was established in Majuro in June 2009.
Current status.
As of April 2013, the LDS Church reported 6,030 members, 1 stake, 1 district, 6 wards, 6 branches, 12 congregations, and 1 mission.
The Majuro Marshall Islands stake, Marshall Islands first, was organized on June 14, 2009 with Arlington Jabat as president.
The United States Department of State has estimated that members of the church make up 8.3% of the population, making the church the fourth largest in the nation.

"My Motherland" was initially called "A Big River" (《一條大河》) by the author, in order to represent the hundreds of rivers that flow in China. The title was changed when it was published with the movie. The song is divided into 3 stanzas. Within each stanza, the soloist sings first before the chorus sings its refrain.
Although the song was written for a movie about Korean War in the 1950s, there is no explicit mention of the war at all. It describes a soldier (or anyone who is away from home) thinking about his home and his family.
The music for solo part has folk song style similar to those in northern China.

Tabatha Coffey

Tabatha Coffey (born 17 May 1969) is an Australian hairstylist, salon owner, and television personality. Her participation as a contestant on the television show "Shear Genius" led to her own fame in the US. She was given a television show, Tabatha Takes Over, which airs on the US cable television network Bravo. In Australia it airs on Foxtel's pay television network Arena as well as on Network Ten.
Career.
Tabatha, whose mother and brother were hairstylists, got her start in her hometown of Surfers Paradise in Queensland, where she started as an assistant in a local shop at the age of 14. A year later, she entered a four-year apprenticeship programme to learn more. Later, she moved to London to continue her training for the next three years.
Coffey opened her own salon, "Industrie Hair Gurus" in Ridgewood, New Jersey. She also styles clients at the "Warren-Tricomi salon" in West Hollywood. Her approach is transformative, creating a special look for each individual, unlike other stylists who specialize in a certain look. She also works as a platform artist for hair care product company, Joico International. She tours different countries 6–12 times a year doing hair shows for the company, both to showcase her talent and to train other aspiring hairdressers. "My favourite thing is to do work with other professionals and teaching," she said in an interview. "I love giving and getting back from other professionals."
In line with her stated intent to work and teach with other professionals, Tabatha sold her Ridgewood, New Jersey, salon in 2011.
She has also been in beauty publications, as well as backstage in New York's Mercedes Benz Fashion Week. She works regularly as an editorial stylist for top fashion and beauty publications, including "Seventeen", "Marie Claire", and "Mademoiselle". She wrote "It's Not Really About the Hair: The Honest Truth About Life, Love, and the Business of Beauty", published in 2011.
Television.
Coffey was first introduced to American audiences when she became a contestant in the Bravo reality show "Shear Genius". Having auditioned out of curiosity, she quickly earned a reputation for her outspokenness and intensity. She was a front-runner in the competition, winning most of the challenges during her stay, but she was eliminated in the sixth episode, along with her teammate for the day, Tyson. She has made no secret of her objections to Tyson's methods, thinking his ego got in the way of his work. The judges eliminated them for their poor teamwork. Coffey later won $10,000 as the show's Fan Favorite.
In 2008, Coffey was approached by Bravo to star in the reality series "Tabatha's Salon Takeover" in which she uses her hairdressing and business expertise to assist salons that are in danger of closing. The show was renamed "Tabatha Takes Over" for its fourth season. She has also appeared on "Make Me a Supermodel" Season 2, "The Tyra Banks Show" as a part of Banks's "Glam Squad," and "The Biggest Loser" along with Tim Gunn, giving makeovers to the show's contestants.
In 2011, Coffey was the host for the NAHA awards.
Personal life.
An out lesbian, Coffey has been in a relationship with her partner for more than a decade. She lives in Ridgewood, New Jersey.
Coffey, who lost her mother to cancer in 2010, works with Hackensack University Medical Center cutting wigs for children with cancer. This commitment resulted in a partnership beginning in 2011 with St. Baldrick's Foundation, a nonprofit organization that raises money for childhood cancer research by hosting worldwide head-shaving events.

Wong Sun v. United States

Wong Sun v. United States, , is a United States Supreme Court decision excluding the presentation of verbal evidence and recovered narcotics where they were both fruits of an illegal entry. Narcotics agents unlawfully entered Toy's laundry at which point Toy indicated that Yee was selling narcotics. The drug agents then went to Yee and found the narcotics. Yee made a deal to give up his supplier, Wong Sun. The agents then arrested Wong Sun. All were arraigned and released on their own recognizance. Several days later, Wong Sun voluntarily returned to the police station to make a statement, during the process of which he confessed. 
The Supreme Court held that Toy's statements and the discovered drugs at Yee's should both be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree because the search was done without a warrant. Wong Sun's lawyer argued that Wong Sun's confession should also be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree. Wong Sun's statement was ruled admissible because he had no standing to move to suppress the evidence found in Yee's apartment. Wong Sun was granted a new trial, but his confession was admissible.

Universal monarchy

A Universal Monarchy is a concept and a political situation where one monarchy is deemed to have either sole rule over everywhere (or at least the predominant part of a geopolitical area or areas) or to have a special supremacy over all other states (or at least all the states in a geopolitical area or areas).
Concept.
Universal Monarchy is differentiated from ordinary monarchy in that a Universal Monarchy is beholden to no other state and asserts a degree of total sovereignty over an area, or predominance over other states. 
The concept has arisen in Europe and Asia. The concept is linked to that of Empire, but implies more than simply possessing "imperium".
The Latin phrase "Dominus Mundi", Lord of the World, encapsulates the concept. Though in practice no Universal Monarchy ever held rule over the whole world, it may have appeared to many people, particularly pre-modern, that it did.
Critical of the concept in Europe in the Middle Ages were philosophers such as Nicole Oresme and Erasmus; whereas Dante and Guillaume Postel were more favourable. Later, Protestants would seek to reject the concept, identifying it with Catholicism.
History.
Europe.
In Europe the expression of a Universal Monarchy as actual total "imperium" can be seen in the Roman Empire, and as the predominate ‘sole sovereign’ state during its Byzantine period, where the Emperor by virtue of being the head of Christendom claimed a sovereignty over all other kings even though in practice this could not be enforced. The Byzantine conception went through two phases, initially as expounded by Eusebius that just as there was one God so there could only be one Emperor, which developed in the 10th century into the conception of the Emperor as the "paterfamilias" of a family of kings who were the other rulers in the world. Such concepts were a feature of the Ottoman Empire successor state, particularly when military rule was augmented by the Caliphate.
The idea of a sole sovereign Emperor would re-emerge in the West with Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire. The idea of the Holy Roman Empire possessing a special sovereignty as a Universal Monarchy was respected by the surrounding powers and subject states, even when that Empire had undergone severe fragmentation. The symbolism of the A.E.I.O.U. phrase of Frederick III can be seen as an expression of the idea of all states being subject to one monarchy.
Charles V’s empire, encompassing much of western Europe and the Americas “was the nearest the post-classical world would come to seeing a truly world-wide monarchy, and hence the closest approximation to universal imperium” since the Roman Empire. It was envisaged by its supporters as a religiously inclusive world empire.
Subsequently, the idea of a Universal Monarchy based on predominance rather than actual total rule would become synonymous with France attempting to establish hegemony over western Europe, particularly under Louis XIV, exemplified by the concept of Louis XIV as the 'Sun King' around which all the other monarchs became subordinate satellites.
Universal Monarchy would flourish at either end of Europe, in Britain and Russia. The Russian Universal Monarchy was Orthodox, autocratic and possessed a vast contiguous empire throughout Europe and Asia and can be seen to have similarities and differences with Byzantine rule. The British Universal Monarchy was “Protestant, commercial, maritime and free” and was not composed of contiguous territory. It had both similarities and difference with the Spanish empire. Whereas Catholicism provided ideological unity for the Spanish empire, British Protestant diversity would lead to “disunity rather than unity”. It was only later that federalism and economic control was seen as a means to provide unity where religious diversity could not, as with the idea of Imperial Federation as promoted by Joseph Chamberlain.
Napoleon came close to creating something akin to a Universal Monarchy with his continental system and Napoleonic Code, but he failed to conquer all of Europe. The last attempt to create a European Universal Monarchy was that attempted by Imperial Germany in the Great War. If Germany had been victorious the German Kaiser would have been suzerain over most of Europe.
Asia.
A parallel process occurred in Asia. Whereas in the West the title of Emperor had by the 19th century largely been stripped of religious connotations and had come to be seen purely in political terms, the title in eastern Asia is almost entirely a religious one, commonly stated as ‘the son of heaven’. Here the title denotes a higher, ‘heavenly’ rule (‘celestial empire’), in contrast to kings who rule between heaven and earth, and by extension today to presidents who are mere base earthly rulers. Imperial China was a Universal Monarchy where all other monarchs were regarded as tributary. The concept was taken up by the Mongols, who under Genghis Khan were able to enforce this concept more widely than China. The Japanese attempt to unify South East Asia in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under Emperor Hirohito follows the model set by Imperial Germany and Joseph Chamberlain of imperial rule based on economic union, matched with Japanese religious ideas. 
The Hindu/Buddhist concept of the Chakravartin is a perfect illustration of the ideal of a Universal Monarch.

Wedge Island (South Australia)

 
Wedge Island is a partly privately owned island, with an area of about 10 km2, in south-eastern Australia. It is the largest of the small Gambier Islands Group lying between the southern tips of the Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas in South Australia at the entrance to Spencer Gulf.
Description.
There is a lighthouse at the south-eastern end, and highest point, of the island. There is an airstrip on the island as well as a jetty. The island is not permanently inhabited, but has buildings used for holiday accommodation and as a base for local and offshore recreational fishing. It is also a dive site.
Wildlife.
The endangered Brush-tailed Bettong has been introduced to the island. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports over 1% of the world population, with up to about 16,000 breeding pairs, of White-faced Storm-Petrels.
An account of the wildlife on Wedge Island from 1928 reads:
"The penguins were busy with their half-grown youngsters, and after dark the night echoed to their weird and ghostlike cries. Quail were plentiful among the grass paddocks and flew up almost from beneath our feet, while high above our heads a pair of wedge-tailed eagles wheeled and circled then planed slowly down to alight upon a lone pinnacle of the rocky western coast."
History.
Wedge Island was named in 1802 by Matthew Flinders. It was originally settled in the mid-19th century as a farm for breeding horses for the British Indian Army, with various agricultural activities such sheep and cattle grazing and wheat cropping continuing for the next 130 years. 
During World War II, Wedge Island was used as a radar station by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A bunker was constructed near the lighthouse and was occupied by about 40 RAAF personnel for several years.

<doc id="19477076" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19477076" title="Warren A. Morton">
Warren A. Morton

Warren Allen Morton (March 22, 1924 – February 18, 2002) was a Casper oilman and engineer who served as Speaker of the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1979 to 1980, prior to mounting a Republican gubernatorial campaign in 1982. He served in the Wyoming House from Natrona County from January 1, 1967, to December 31, 1980. Morton was the managing partner of MKM Oil Company in Casper, the seat of Natrona County in eastern Wyoming and the second largest city in the state.
Early years, education, family, military.
Morton was born in Birmingham, the seat of Jefferson County and the largest city in Alabama, to Lindley C. Morton of California and the former Ruth Goddard, a native of Connecticut. Lindley and Ruth moved to Alabama because of his job with Portland Cement Company. The Mortons returned to California and reared their family of three sons and a daughter. Morton's brothers were Robert Morton and Coleman Morton (1919–2006), both of Pasadena; his surviving sister is Sylvia Morton Kingsley of San Francisco.
Morton graduated from the Hotchkiss School, a boarding school for boys, since coeducational, located in Lakeville, a village in Litchfield County, Connecticut. He then attended Yale University in New Haven, from which he graduated in the field of engineering in 1945. Thereafter, from 1945 to 1947, he was an ensign in the United States Navy, having been commissioned through Columbia University in New York City. In 1948, he married the former Katharine Hancock "Kathy" Allen (born 1926), the daughter of Robert Gray Allen, a former Democratic U.S. representative from Greensburg in western Pennsylvania. 
In 1952, Warren and Kathy Morton moved to Casper from Long Beach, California, where Morton had been a petroleum engineer. They had four sons. Frederick Lee "Ted" Morton (born 1949 in Los Angeles) is a political science professor on extended leave from the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Allen Morton (born 1951) is a mergers and acquisitions specialist for Royal Bank in San Francisco. Robert C. "Bob" Morton (born 1953) is an attorney in Salt Lake City, Utah. Warren Goddard Morton (born 1957) is a Landman for True Oil Company and resides in Casper.
Morton as House Speaker.
The fiscally conservative Morton, who was a director of the Wyoming Taxpayers Association, was not otherwise a typical Wyoming Republican. He supported a woman's right to procure an abortion and gun control laws, particularly opposed by his state's large community of hunters. As House Speaker, his colleagues considered him strict, smart, and fair. Tom Stroock, a former state senator from Casper and a United States Ambassador to Guatemala, described the former Speaker as "brilliant. . . Warren had an important part to play in the history of Wyoming in the 1970s and 1980s. He was clearly an outstanding Speaker and an excellent legislator," though Stroock said that he did not always agree with Morton's political positions. 
Marlene Simons of Beulah, who was a freshman representative when Morton was Speaker, said that he had been a mentor to beginning legislators, seating them among the more experienced lawmakers. "He ran a tight ship. He was a kind, gentle man, but he was stern."
Gubernatorial campaign.
Morton easily won the GOP primary to challenge two-term Democratic Governor Edgar Herschler of Kemmerer in Lincoln County. He polled 52,536 votes (74.3 percent). Rex G. Welty (1921–1992) of Afton in Lincoln County received 9,106 ballots (12.9), and Earl A. Johnson drew 9,025 (12.8 percent). Nels J. Smith of Sundance in northeastern Wyoming, who had been Morton's predecessor as House Speaker, filed for governor but withdrew before the primary. In a nationally Democratic year, Herschler charged that Morton was a tool of the energy interests. Morton was active in the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association, having been the president of the interest group from 1963 to 1965. In addition to his own MKM company, Morton was a director of the American Petroleum Institute and was the Wyoming representative on the Interstate Oil Compact Commission from 1962 to 1972.
Morton received 62,128 votes (36.9 percent) to Herschler's 106,427 (63.1 percent). Morton polled only 9,592 more votes in the general election than he had the primary. Herschler, however, received 62,031 more votes in the final round than he had in the Democratic primary against Pat McGuire. Herschler's plurality over Morton was hence almost numerically the same as Morton's total vote in the general election.
Morton ran nearly twelve percentage points behind John C. Ostlund, a former state senator, who had lost to Herschler in 1978. Of the three Republicans who challenged Herschler, Ostlund had fared best, losing by one percentage point. While Morton lost the governorship, Republican U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop of Sheridan defeated the Democrat former State Senator Rodger McDaniel, 57–43 percent. McDaniel had been the Wyoming state coordinator for the unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1980 of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
After his gubernatorial defeat, Morton continued to support Republican candidates in Wyoming, such as U.S. Senators Craig Thomas, Alan K. Simpson, Mike Enzi, and Malcolm Wallop, as well as his state's GOP organization. In 2000, he also donated to then U.S. Representative Rick Lazio of New York in the latter's bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate. In 1979, Morton contributed to the failed presidential bid of former Texas Governor John B. Connally before switching his support to Ronald W. Reagan.
Death and legacy.
Morton had struggled for four years with Alzheimer's disease and then developed Parkinson's disease. Wife Kathy recalls that Morton "had a very good sense of humor about it [Alzheimer's]. He was very open and honest." Morton died at the family's winter residence in Litchfield Park in Maricopa County near Phoenix, Arizona. He was cremated. Memorial services were held at St. Mark's Church in Casper on March 2, 2002.
Morton served on the board of trustees of the two-year Casper College, a community college. He was involved in numerous community affairs, including the management of a Little League baseball team for seven years. He was a director and past president of the Wyoming Heritage Society. He served on the boards of the United Fund, Chamber of Commerce, and St. Mark's Episcopal Church.
Jim Geringer, the only Republican since 1975 to have served as governor of Wyoming (1995–2003), issued a statement on Morton's death: "I'm deeply saddened at the news of Warren Morton's passing. Lady Sherri and I extend our sympathy and support to Katharine and the rest of the family. Warren set a high standard for public service with his involvement in community activities as Speaker of the House . . . , as a member of several committees and study groups, including the Tax Reform 2000 Commission, the Wyoming Futures Project, and the 1991 commission that studied judicial salaries. Warren served out of commitment and compassion. He was a true Wyoming statesman, businessman, and family man. We will certainly miss Warren."

USCGC Tampa (WPG-48)

USCGC "Tampa" (Coast Guard Cutter No. 48) was a United States Coast Guard Cutter that served in the United States Coast Guard from 1921 to 1941, and then in the United States Navy from 1941 to 1947.
History.
"Tampa", a steel-hulled, single-screw cutter, was laid down on 27 September 1920 at Oakland, California, by the Union Construction Company. She was launched on 19 April 1921, sponsored by Mrs. Joseph P. Conners, and commissioned on 15 September 1921, Lieutenant Commander M. J. Wheeler, USCG, in command.
"Tampa" got underway for the United States East Coast, transited the Panama Canal on 28 October 1921, and arrived at New York, New York, on 7 November 1921. On 23 November 1921, the cutter shifted to Boston, Massachusetts, her home port. In the ensuing years, "Tampa" operated as part of the International Ice Patrol established in the aftermath of the RMS "Titanic" tragedy in 1912. Between March and July — the peak months in which icebergs were regarded as a menace to the northernmost transatlantic sea lanes — "Tampa" conducted regular patrols, alternating with USCGC "Modoc" (Coast Guard Cutter No. 39) on 15-day stretches. At the end of each patrol, "Tampa" would put into Halifax, Nova Scotia, for stores and fuel. Between these cruises in the frigid waters at the northern end of the Atlantic, "Tampa" operated on exercises and maneuvers, sharpened her skill with target practice and battle drills, and patrolled sailing regattas.
Shifted to the New York division, with headquarters at Stapleton, New York, in August 1932, "Tampa" arrived at her new home port on the 27 August 1932. She operated from this base until the late 1930s. During this time, she participated in the drama which accompanied the tragic fire on board the Ward Line steamer SS "Morro Castle".
"Morro Castle" rescue.
At about 0230 on the morning of 8 September 1934, a fire broke out aboard the ocean liner as she was returning from a Caribbean cruise. The fires spread rapidly, and inept seamanship on the behalf of her captain — who had only taken command after the ship's regular master had died earlier that evening — resulted in the loss of many lives.
Moored at Staten Island, New York, when "Morro Castle" caught fire, "Tampa" received word of the disaster at 0436 on the morning of 8 September 1934. She hurriedly recalled her liberty party, got up steam, and put out to sea at 1540. It took two hours to reach the scene of the holocaust, but when she arrived, "Tampa" assumed direction of the rescue operations which, by that time, were already well underway. Surfboats from the U.S. Coast Guard's Shark River Station — the first help to arrive - had rescued some 120 people before the New York pilot boat and boats from the Sandy Hook Station appeared and joined in the effort. The cutter had also been on station for some time.
"Tampa" passed a towline to the stricken ship, but it soon parted with the sharp crack of a pistol shot and fouled the cutter's screw. "Tampa" herself drifted perilously close to shore before the cutter towed her out of danger. When conducted in smooth seas, operations to save lives are difficult enough; the gale raging off the New Jersey shore on the morning of 8 September 1934 made matters markedly worse. Nevertheless, the Coast Guardsmen performed feats of great heroism in rescuing the liner's passengers and crew from the storm-tossed waves. During the rescue, "Tampa" had accounted for 140 survivors.
Shifted to Mobile, Alabama, in the late 1930s, "Tampa" operated in the Gulf of Mexico into 1941.
World War II service.
She came under US Navy command in November 1941, a month before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Apparently transferred back to the North Atlantic for coastal convoy escort runs in the Greenland area, "Tampa" departed Narsarssuak, Greenland, on 3 May 1942 to escort the merchantman "Chatham" to the Cape Cod Canal. The ships stopped briefly at St. John's, Newfoundland, and then pushed on toward the Massachusetts coast. "Tampa" lost track of "Chatham" in dense fog on the 16th but regained contact near the eastern entrance of the canal and safely conducted the merchantman on her way. "Tampa" then searched, unsuccessfully, for a German U-boat reported in the vicinity before she put into Boston on the 17th.
She remained there for repairs and alterations until the 30th when she sailed for Argentia, Newfoundland. While escorting SS "Montrose", "Tampa" picked up a sound contact and dropped depth charges but could not claim a "kill." On 3 June, "Montrose" ran aground on Moratties Reef. "Tampa", assisted by two naval vessels, soon floated the merchantman free; and the cutter continued her escort mission, routed onward to Greenland. Arriving at Sondrestrom fjord on the 10th, Tampa conducted harbor entrance patrols before proceeding to Ivigtut. There, she guarded the cryolite mine—which provided ore vitally needed for the production of aluminum—from the 16th to the 26th.
During the last half of 1942, "Tampa" — designated WPG-48 in or around February 1942 — conducted 12 more convoy escort missions between Iceland, Greenland, and Nova Scotia. She left Argentia on 1 January 1943 with "Tahoma" (WPG-80), bound for St. John's where she arrived soon thereafter. Moored until the 6th, "Tampa" then got underway to escort a convoy routed to Greenland and then screened two groups of merchantmen—GS-18 and ON-161—to Newfoundland.
On 29 January, she got underway, with ) and "Comanche" (WPG-75), to escort Convoy SG-19, which consisted of Army transport and merchantman SS "Biscaya" and SS "Lutz" to Greenland. Bad weather soon hampered the convoy's progress; and the flank escorts, "Comanche" and "Escanaba", soon had difficulties keeping station. Icing had increased their displacement and reduced their speed accordingly. This fact, in turn, slowed the whole convoy. By 2 February, the weather had somewhat improved; but a radio direction finder had discovered the presence of an enemy submarine. "Tampa" accordingly screened ahead, some 3,000 yards from "Dorchester", while "Escanaba" and "Comanche" were deployed on each flank, 5,400 yards from "Lutz" and "Biscaya", respectively.
Convoy SG-19 soon came into the periscope sight of , which maneuvered astern to bring her tubes to bear. The U-boat torpedoed "Dorchester" astern at 0355. "Tampa" observed the transport veering hard to port and showing numerous small lights. "Biscaya" quickly fired two green signal rockets and executed an emergency turn to avoid fouling the mortally stricken "Dorchester".
Three minutes after "Dorchester" had been struck, her master ordered her abandoned. As the ship went down, four Army chaplains gave up their life jackets to soldiers who had none to ensure the survival of others at the expense of themselves. Meanwhile, "Escanaba" and "Comanche" searched for "U-223", while "Tampa" escorted "Lutz" and "Biscaya" to Skovfjord before returning to assist in the hunt for survivors. "Tampa" subsequently searched for survivors on the 4th, but sighted only numerous bodies; two swamped lifeboats manned only by corpses; and seven life rafts. She found no signs of life before she returned to Narsarssuak on 6 February.
"Tampa" resumed convoy operations, performing local escort in the Greenland area for the remainder of February 1943. She continued these operations through the spring. On 12 June 1943, she departed Narsarssuak with four other escorts, escorting a three-ship convoy for Argentia. The next day, at 0508, she observed smoke on the horizon, and received a report that "Escanaba" was afire. In fact, "Escanaba" had been blown to bits by an explosion of undetermined origin. Only three survivors were picked up by "Raritan" (WYT-93), and one of these died. The other two could not explain what had destroyed their ship.
"Tampa" escorted convoys for the remainder of 1943 before returning to Boston on the last day of the year for an overhaul which extended through January 1944. She resumed convoy escort operations in the North Atlantic, between Boston and Greenland—primarily in the Argentia and Narsarssuak vicinities—and continued the task through 1944 and into 1945.
Post war service and fate.
With the cessation of hostilities in Europe in May 1945, Tampa resumed ice patrols off the Grand Banks in June through August, alternating with "Modoc" (WPG-46) and "Mojave" (WPG-47). Leaving Argentia on 6 September 1945, less than a month after the war against Japan ended, "Tampa" operated between there and Boston, receiving a 30-day availability at the Coast Guard yard in Boston in November and December.
"Tampa" subsequently cruised on North Atlantic ice patrol duties into August 1946. She was decommissioned on 1 February 1947 and turned over to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration which sold her to Charles M. Barnett, Jr., on 22 September 1947.

Dropbox (service)

Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, and client software. Dropbox allows users to create a special folder on each of their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which computer is used to view it. Files placed in this folder also are accessible through a website and mobile phone applications.
Dropbox, Inc., was founded in 2007 by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, as a Y Combinator startup company.
Dropbox provides client software for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, BlackBerry OS and web browsers, as well as unofficial ports to Symbian, Windows Phone, and MeeGo.
History.
According to Dropbox, founder Drew Houston conceived the idea after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at MIT. He says that existing services at the time "suffered problems with Internet latency, large files, bugs, or just made me think too much". He began making something for his personal use, but then realized that it could benefit others with the same problems. Houston founded Dropbox, Inc. in June 2007, and shortly thereafter secured seed funding from Y Combinator. Dropbox officially launched at 2008's TechCrunch50, an annual technology conference.
Due to trademark disputes between Proxy, Inc. and Evenflow (Dropbox's parent company), Dropbox's official domain name was ""get"dropbox.com" until October 2009, when they acquired their current domain, "dropbox.com".
OPSWAT reported in their December 2011 market share report that Dropbox held 14.14% of the worldwide backup client market, based on number of installations.
In May 2011, Dropbox struck deals with Japanese mobile service providers Softbank and Sony Ericsson. As per the terms of the deal Dropbox will come preloaded on their mobile telephones.
In May 2010, Dropbox users in China were unable to access Dropbox. Later, Dropbox confirmed they had been blocked by the Chinese government. Due to the fact that the censorship usually focuses on popular services only, many considered this evidence of Dropbox's rapidly rising popularity and international user base. , the website is still blocked in China, but locally installed applications are usable with some ISPs.
, Dropbox had more than 50 million registered users.
In April 2012, Dropbox announced a new feature allowing users to automatically upload photographs or videos from camera, tablet, SD card, or smartphone. Users will be given up to 3 GB (initially 5 GB) extra space to accommodate the photographs and videos uploaded in this fashion, but the space is permanently added to the user's allowance and is not restricted to pictures. It is viewed as a move against Google's recently launched Google Drive and Microsoft's SkyDrive.
, Facebook and Dropbox integrated to allow group users to share files to Facebook Groups using Dropbox’s cloud-based storage system. The feature allows users to directly share inside Facebook's group pages without exiting the Facebook domain. This did not replace the built in Facebook uploading feature, but added to it for any files that were already uploaded to their Dropbox storage account.
On November 12, 2012, Dropbox announced it had reached 100 million users.
On December 19, 2012, Dropbox acquired Snapjoy, which provided a service for aggregating, archiving and viewing all digital photographs taken with cameras, phones, or popular photo applications. Financial terms were not released at the time of the acquisition.
As of February 2013, Dropbox was responsible for 0.29% of all worldwide Internet traffic.
On March 15, 2013, Dropbox acquired the email management application for iOS "Mailbox".
On July 20, 2013, Dropbox acquired mobile coupon startup Endorse.
On November 13, 2013, Dropbox announced it had reached 200 million users, and announced changes to "Dropbox for Business".
On November 21, 2013, Dropbox released new application versions for iOS. The new design has a cleaner and simpler user interface which brings the app in-line with other iOS 7 offerings.
Financials.
Dropbox is funded by Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners, and Amidzad. Starting in mid-2009, they began releasing new features gradually to help measure customer interest, a Lean Startup technique.
Dropbox has received total venture capital funding of US$257.2 million from several investors, including Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital, and Accel Partners. 
In 2011, technology entrepreneur Praveen Yajman speculated that Dropbox's valuation was more than $1 billion. TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Business Insider, and Financial Post speculated that Dropbox's valuation could be up to $5 to $10 billion, while its 2011 revenue was expected to be $240 million.
On April 3, 2012, Dropbox announced Bono and The Edge, two members of the Irish rock band U2, were individual investors in the company.
Business model.
Dropbox uses a freemium business model, where users are offered a free account with a set storage size and paid subscriptions for accounts with more capacity.
The desktop client has no restriction on individual file size; files uploaded via the web site are limited to no more than 10 GB per file. To prevent free users from creating multiple linked free accounts, Dropbox includes the content of shared folders when totaling the amount of space used on the account.
Technology.
Both the Dropbox server and desktop client software are primarily written in Python. The desktop client uses GUI toolkits such as wxWidgets and Cocoa. Other notable Python libraries include Twisted, ctypes, and pywin32. Dropbox ships and depends on the librsync binary-delta library (which is written in C).
The Dropbox client enables users to drop any file into a designated folder that is then synchronized with Dropbox's Internet service and to any other of the user's computers and devices with the Dropbox client. Users may also upload files manually through a web browser.
Dropbox client supports synchronization and sharing along with personal storage. It supports revision history, so files deleted from the Dropbox folder may be recovered from any of the synced computers. Dropbox supports multi-user version control, enabling several users to edit and re-post files without overwriting versions. The version history is by default kept for 30 days, with an unlimited version called "Pack-Rat" available for purchase.
The version history is paired with the use of delta encoding technology. When a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, Dropbox only uploads the pieces of the file that are changed when synchronizing, when possible.
Dropbox uses Amazon's S3 storage system to store the files; though Houston has stated that Dropbox may switch to a different storage provider at some point in the future. It also uses SSL transfers for synchronization and stores the data via AES-256 encryption, though this is done with Dropbox's own encryption keys, and not the users'.
Dropbox also provides a technology called LAN sync, which allows computers on a local area network to securely download files locally from each other instead of always hitting the central servers. LANSync was developed by Dropbox Engineer Paul Bohm.
Functionality.
Users have devised a number of uses for and mashups of the technology that expand Dropbox's functionality. These include: sending files to a Dropbox via Gmail; using Dropbox to sync IM chat logs; BitTorrent management; password management; remote application launching and system monitoring; and as a free Web hosting service.
Add-ons.
There are official and unofficial Dropbox add-ons, mostly created by the Dropbox community. These add-ons are both in the form of web services such as SendToDropbox (which allows users to email files to their Dropboxes), Backup Box (which facilitates online backup of FTP, Git, MySQL, and other services to Dropbox accounts), and desktop applications such as MacDropAny (which allows users to sync any folder on their computer with Dropbox).
There are a number of client applications for operating systems that Dropbox does not officially support, such as Maemo, Symbian, Windows Phone and webOS.
An open source tool called Dropship provided unauthenticated access to Dropbox-hosted files by using the Dropbox API to access files by their hash. Dropbox attempted to suppress this project by requesting its suspension where it was being hosted, and by issuing an erroneous DMCA takedown notice, later said by Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi to have been incorrectly auto-generated by a support tool used to ban the public links.
Reception.
Dropbox has been praised by many publications—including "The Economist", "New York Times", "PC Magazine", and "The Washington Post"—for its simple design and ease of use. It has also received several awards, including the Crunchie Award in 2009 for Best Internet Application, and Macworld's 2009 Editor's Choice Award. It was nominated for a 2010 Webby Award, and for the 2010 Mac Design Awards by Ars Technica.
Dropbox has been named as the world's fifth most valuable web startup after Facebook, Twitter, Zynga, and Groupon, has been described as Y Combinator's most successful investment to date, and is among the top 10 iPhone most popular apps of all time, according to TechCrunch. It was voted among the top 10 Android apps of all time, according to ZDNet, said to be one of the top 50 emerging companies by TIEcon, and called one of the 20 best startups of Silicon Valley. Drew Houston was called the best young tech entrepreneur by "Business Week", and he and co-founder Arash Ferdowsi were named among the top 30 under 30 entrepreneurs by inc.com. In January 2012, the company was named startup of the year by TechCrunch.
Privacy concerns.
Dropbox has been criticized by the independent security researcher Derek Newton, who said that Dropbox stores authentication secret (not password) on disk in plain-text (this was fixed in 1.2.48) and by the software engineer Miguel de Icaza, who says that Dropbox's terms of service contradict its privacy policy, and that the company's famous claim "Dropbox employees aren't able to access user files" is a lie.
In May 2011, a complaint was filed with the U.S. FTC alleging Dropbox misled users about the privacy and security of their files. At the heart of the complaint was the policy of "deduplication", where the system checks if a file has been uploaded before by any other user, and links to the existing copy if so; and the policy of using a single AES-256 key for every file on the system so Dropbox can (and does, for deduplication) look at encrypted files stored on the system, with the consequence that any intruder who gets the key (as well as Dropbox employees) could decrypt any file if they had access to Dropbox's backend storage infrastructure.
On June 20, 2011, TechCrunch reported that all Dropbox accounts could be accessed without password for four hours. This was later widely reported in the mainstream press and caused some doubt about Dropbox's "cloud" technology model. The error was caused by an authentication code update made at 1:54 p.m. Pacific Time; it was detected at 5:41 p.m. and immediately fixed. About 1% of Dropbox's users were logged in at that time; all sessions were immediately terminated. All users with compromised accounts were notified by email.
On July 31, 2012, Dropbox announced that an employee's account had been hacked, resulting in a number of Dropbox users' being spammed by email. In March 2013, users reported additional spam resulting from the July email leakage.
On June 6, 2013, "The Guardian" and "The Washington Post" publicized confidential documents suggesting Dropbox was being considered for inclusion in the National Security Agency's classified PRISM program of Internet surveillance.
On January 10, 2014, Dropbox experienced an outage, which the company publicly acknowledged on the company's home page: "We are aware of an issue currently affecting the Dropbox site". It continued, "We have identified the cause, which was the result of an issue that arose during routine internal maintenance, and are working to fix this as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience." A hacker group called The 1775 Sec tweeted that it had compromised Dropbox's site to honor the anniversary of the Internet activist and computer programmer Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide in January 2013, and had stolen a list of emails, which they posted on the website Pastebin. However, Dropbox denied having been hacked, asserting the "hacker incident" was a hoax. The security researcher Wesley Mcgrew further pointed out the emails supposedly stolen from Dropbox have been found elsewhere on the web, and a known Anonymous Twitter account officially denied the hacker group's involvement.
Headquarters.
Dropbox had premises at 760 Market Street in San Francisco, until moving to larger premises in July 2011.
From that date Dropbox's corporate headquarters are at Suite 400 on the fourth floor of the China Basin Landing building in San Francisco. The company occupies the fourth floor of the 1991 section of the facility, with of space, and an option to take more space.

Rouge de l'Ouest

The Rouge de l'Ouest (also known as "Tête rouge du Maine") is breed of domestic sheep originating in France. The breed's name, which literally translates from French as "Red of the West", refers to its region of origin and its unique pinkish face and legs. It was developed in the Maine et Loire department of France, through crossing local landrace sheep with Wensleydales and Bluefaced Leicesters. The French registry was established in 1968, and the U.K. registry was in 1986.
The Rouge was originally a dairy sheep breed used to produce Camembert cheese, but is now primarily raised for meat. Particularly, Rouge rams are used as sires for market lambs. It has medium length wool, a polled head, and a well-muscled body. Despite its quite different appearance, it is related to the Bleu du Maine. The average fleece weight for the Rouge is 1.5 kg (0.68 lbs) to 2.0 kg (0.9 lbs) with a staple length of 4 cm (1.8 inches) to 5 cm (2.3 inches) and a spinning count of 58's to 60's.

Racka

The Racka is a breed of sheep known for its unusual spiral-shaped horns. These unique appendages are unlike any other domestic sheep horns, and may grow up to long. The smallest standard length is for rams and for ewes. 
Originating in Hungary, the Racka has existed since at least the 1800, when the first registry was established. It is a hardy, multi-purpose breed used for milking, wool and meat. Their wool is long and coarse, and appears in two general types: a cream wool with light brown faces and legs, and a black variation. Ewes weigh around , and rams .
The breed's unique appearance and quiet disposition would make it a desirable animal for hobby situations.
Characteristics.
This breed is unique with both sexes possessing long spiral shaped horns. The cork-screw horns protrude almost straight upward from the top of the head.
There are two major color patterns with the Racka. The most common color is brown wool covering the heads and legs with the fiber varying in color from dark brown to light brown and white. Individuals can also be solid black. The wool tips on the black-colored sheep fades to a reddish black with exposure to sunlight and as they get older, the points of the fiber turns gray. The fiber diameter varies within this breed and generally is found to be 12 to 40 micrometres with a yield of 38% to 65%. Staple length is approximately . Fleece weight must be at least for rams. The softness and crimp of the wool would indicate its interest with hand spinners.
The minimum acceptable mature body weight for ewes is and for rams . The rams' average in height.

Form-based authentication

Form-based authentication is a term of art in the context of Web- and Internet-based online networked computer systems. In general, it refers to the notion of a user being presented with an editable "form" to fill in and submit in order to log into some system or service. However, the term is actually ambiguous in that the notion of using some sort of displayed "form" in which one enters credential information is a technique that is "not" unique to the Web.
As the term is often used, it strongly implies default employment of HTTP and HTML (or XHTML) as part of the technique. This particular technique is specifically discussed in the article HTTP+HTML form-based authentication.
A defining characteristic of the general notion of form-based authentication, as it is commonly used, is that the credential prompting and subsequent credential conveyance is conducted out-of-band relative to the transfer protocol employed between the client and server. For example, in the case of HTTP+HTML form-based authentication, the authentication features built into HTTP itself are not used. Rather, the prompting information, e.g., "username: " and "password: ", are conveyed, opaquely to HTTP itself, as just HTML or XHTML codice_1 data. Similarly, the submitted credentials are conveyed simply as part of submitted codice_1 data.
Note that in the case of the common "login prompt" one sees when using telnet to access another computer system, the former general notion applies. I.e., it is another instance of "form-based authentication".
Further characteristics and implications of the general notion of form-based authentication, as the term is commonly employed, are that it is inherently "ad hoc" and not standardized, the client does not authenticate the server unless extra means are employed (e.g. TLS), the client typically is not made explicitly aware of the authentication mechanism being employed by the server nor the level of assurance that the authentication mechanism features.

Antoine Gouan

Antoine Gouan (November 15, 1733 – September 1, 1821) was a French naturalist who was a native of Montpellier. Gouan was a pioneer of Linnaean taxonomy in France.
He began his studies in Toulouse, later returning to Montpellier, where he studied medicine at the university. Here he was a student of François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix (1706–1767), an ardent supporter of Carolus Linnaeus. In August 1752, Gouan received his doctorate under the chairmanship of Antoine Magnol (1676–1759), and subsequently practiced medicine at Saint-Éloi Hospital in Montpellier. Soon afterwards his interest turned to natural history.
In 1762 Gouan published a plant catalog of the botanical garden at Montpellier titled "Hortus regius monspeliensis". This publication was the first French botanical work that followed the binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus. In 1765 he penned "Flora Monspeliaca", and became "titulaire" at the Montpellier Academy. During this time period he attained a position at the botanical garden, and was in charge of collection and classification of plant species. In 1770 he published an important ichthyological treatise called "Historia Piscicum", a work that expanded the number of fish genera that existed in the Linnaean system.
In 1766 he succeeded Sauvages de Lacroix at the Faculty of Medicine, and in 1783 became a foreign member of the Linnean Society of London. During his career he maintained correspondence with several learned scientists and thinkers, which included in addition to Linnaeus; Albrecht von Haller (1708–1777), Jean Guillaume Bruguière (1750–1798), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), Carl Peter Thunberg (1743–1828), et al.
In 1790, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 
Gouan is credited with planting the first ginkgo biloba in France, a tree that was given to him by naturalist Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet (1761–1807). Today this tree is still standing in the botanical garden of Montpellier. During his career he amassed a large collection of algae that was harvested around Marseille.

Originally trained as an architect, he had just begun a career in children's literature when the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 prompted him to emigrate to Munich, West Germany, where he worked for Radio Free Europe from 1951 to 1957. "This Is Paris" appeared in 1959, starting what ultimately grew into a series of eighteen books. Šašek's "This Is London" received the "New York Times" Choice of Best Illustrated Children's Book of the Year in 1959, as did "This Is New York" in 1960. "This Is New York" also received the Boy's Club of America Junior Books Award in 1961, while "This Is the United Nations" appeared on the International Board on Books for Young People Honor List in 1979.

Biology of depression

Scientific studies have found that numerous brain areas show altered activity in patients suffering from depression, and this has encouraged advocates of various theories that seek to identify a biochemical origin of the disease, as opposed to theories that emphasize psychological or situational causes. Among the theories of a biologically based cause of depression are those involving genetics and circadian rhythms, but the most prominent and widely researched is the monoamine hypothesis.
Genetic factors.
In 2003 "Science" published an influential study of Avshalom Caspi et al. who found that a gene-environment interaction (GxE) may explain why life stress is a predictor for depressive episodes in some individuals, but not in others, depending on an allelic variation of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR). Soon after, the results were replicated by Kenneth Kendler's group, raising hopes in the psychiatric genetics community. By 2007 there were 11 replications, 3 partial replication and 3 non-replications of this proposed GxE. However, two of the largest studies were negative. Two 2009 meta-analyses were also negative; one included 14 studies, the other just five, owing to different study selection criteria. A 2010 review of studies in this area found 17 replications, 8 partial replications (interaction only in females or only with one of several types of adversity), and 9 non-replications (no interaction or an interaction in the opposite direction). It also found a systematic relationship between the method used to assess environmental adversity and the results of the studies; all studies using objective indicators or structured interviews to assess stress replicated the gene–environment interaction fully or partially, whereas all non-replications relied on brief self-report measures of adversity. This review also found that both 2009 meta-analyses were significantly biased toward negative studies.
Other hypothesized genomic influences are BDNF polymorphisms, but the replications studies have been mixed and insufficient as of 2005 for a meta-analysis. Studies also indicate an association of BDNF to suicidal behavior. However, findings from the gene-environment interactions studies suggest that the current BDNF models of depression are too simplistic. A 2008 study found interactions (biological epistasis) in the signaling pathways of the BDNF and the serotonin transporter; the BDNF Val66Met allele, which was predicted to have reduced responsitivity to serotonin, was found to exercise protective effects in individuals with the short 5-HTTLPR allele that is otherwise believed to predispose individuals to depressive episodes after stressful events. Thus, the BDNF-mediated signalling involved in neuroplastic responses to stress and antidepressants is influenced by other genetic and environmental modifiers.
Circadian rhythm.
Research on the effects of light therapy on seasonal affective disorder suggests that light deprivation is related to decreased activity in the serotonergic system and to abnormalities in the sleep cycle, particularly insomnia. Exposure to light also targets the serotonergic system, providing more support for the important role this system may play in depression. Sleep deprivation and light therapy both target the same brain neurotransmitter system and brain areas as antidepressant drugs, and are now used clinically to treat depression. Light therapy, sleep deprivation and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being used in combination quickly to interrupt a deep depression in hospitalized patients.
Chemicals.
Monoamine.
Monoamines are neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that include serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Many antidepressant drugs increase synaptic levels of the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin, but they may also enhance the levels of two other neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and dopamine. The observation of this efficacy led to the "monoamine hypothesis of depression", which postulates that the deficit of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for the corresponding features of depression: "Norepinephrine may be related to alertness and energy as well as anxiety, attention, and interest in life; of serotonin to anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions; and dopamine to attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward, as well as interest in life." The proponents of this hypothesis recommend choosing the antidepressant with the mechanism of action impacting the most prominent symptoms. Anxious or irritable patients should be treated with SSRIs or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and the ones with the loss of energy and enjoyment of life—with norepinephrine and dopamine enhancing drugs.

Serotonin receptors are blue, norepinephrine orange, and dopamine yellow. Phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase start a signaling cascade which turn on or off genes in the cell.
The 5HT-3 receptor is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects and has no relationship to the other monoamine receptors. ]]
Consistent with the monoamine hypothesis, a longitudinal study uncovered a moderating effect of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene on stressful life events in predicting depression. Specifically, depression seems especially likely to follow stressful life events, but even more so for people with one or two short alleles of the 5-HTT gene. Serotonin may help to regulate other neurotransmitter systems, and decreased serotonin activity may "permit" these systems to act in unusual and erratic ways. Facets of depression may be emergent properties of this dysregulation.
An offshoot of the monoamine hypothesis suggests that monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme which metabolizes monoamines, may be overly active in depressed people. This would, in turn, cause the lowered levels of monoamines. This hypothesis received support from a PET study, which found significantly elevated activity of MAO-A in the brain of some depressed people. In genetic studies, the alterations of MAO-A-related genes have not been consistently associated with depression. Contrary to the assumptions of the monoamine hypothesis, lowered but not heightened activity of MAO-A was associated with the depressive symptoms in youth. This association was observed only in maltreated youth, indicating that both biological (MAO genes) and psychological (maltreatment) factors are important in the development of depressive disorders. In addition, some evidence indicates that problems in information processing within neural networks, rather than changes in chemical balance, might underlie depression.
Since the 1990s, research has uncovered multiple limitations of the monoamine hypothesis, and its inadequacy has been criticized within the psychiatric community. For one thing, serotonin system dysfunction cannot be the sole cause of depression; antidepressants usually bring serotonin levels up to normal very quickly, but it often takes at least two to four weeks before mood improves significantly. Intensive investigation has failed to find convincing evidence of a primary dysfunction of a specific monoamine system in patients with major depressive disorders. The antidepressants that do not act through the monoamine system, such as tianeptine and opipramol, have been known for a long time. Experiments with pharmacological agents that cause depletion of monoamines have shown that this depletion does not cause depression in healthy people nor does it worsen the symptoms in depressed patients. Already limited, the monoamine hypothesis has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public.
Serotonin.
Many variations of the monoamine hypothesis involve the neurotransmitter serotonin, regulated by the serotonin transporter, which assists the modulation of feelings and behavior such as anxiety, anger, appetite, sexuality, sleep, mood, etc. People with depression may have differences in serotonin transporter gene length. People with both alleles that are long are less likely to become depressed, while people with one short and one long or two short alleles are more likely to develop depression.
The functions of serotonin are difficult to describe in a simple way. In some circumstances serotonin seems to act as a signal of "repletion" or "satisfaction". Thus, satiation after eating, and orgasm following sex, both produce release of serotonin. In animals that have hierarchical social structures, dominant individuals show higher levels of serotonin metabolites than lower-status individuals. In the brain, serotonin exerts a suppressive effect on both the reward system and punishment system, and therefore is likely to reduce the intensity of motivation whether aversive or appetitive.
Fructose.
Fructose malabsorption has been associated with depression in young women. Their mood improved when their intake of fructose was restricted. The mechanisms of these effects are not well understood, but may involve low circulating levels of tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin.
Abnormalities by brain region.
Research on the brains of depressed patients usually shows disturbed patterns of interaction between multiple parts of the brain. Several areas of the brain are implicated in studies seeking to more fully understand the biology of depression:
Raphe nuclei.
The sole source of serotonin in the brain is the raphe nuclei, a group of small nerve cell nuclei in the upper brain stem, located directly at the mid-line of the brain. There is some evidence for neuropathological abnormalities in the rostral raphe nuclei in depression. Despite their small size, they reach very widely through their projections, and are involved in a very diverse set of functions. Most antidepressants are serotonergic.
Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the control center for the body's "biological clock." It contains neurons whose activity waxes and wanes throughout the day. The output from the SCN controls the sleep/wake cycle as well as a number of other biological rhythms, such as fluctuations in body temperature. Disturbances of these cycles are a consistent symptom of depression, especially of the melancholic type. The "classic" pattern is for depressed people to have great difficulty falling asleep at night, and then to wake bolt upright at around 3 AM. The waking is usually preceded by a rise in body temperature, which in non-depressed people does not usually occur until several hours later. It is a common observation that antidepressants produce a return to normal sleep patterns before they produce an improvement in mood: if good sleep does not return, it is a strong sign that the treatment is not going to be effective. Conversely, disruptions to sleep are often the first indication of impending relapse.
There is a powerful interaction between the Raphe nuclei and the SCN. On one hand, the Raphe nuclei send a strong serotonergic projection to the SCN. In animal studies, this input has been shown to modulate the ability of light to reset the timing of the biological clock: the more serotonin, the stronger the effects of light. On the other hand, the biological clock exerts a strong influence on the Raphe nuclei: serotonin levels drop during sleep, and fall almost to nothing during REM (dreaming) sleep. It is worth noting that one of the characteristics of sleep in depressed people is that REM tends to appear very soon after sleep onset, whereas in non-depressed people it does not usually dominate sleep until the last hours, in the early morning. Antidepressants are powerful suppressors of REM. 
Ventral tegmental area (VTA).
The ventral tegmentum (or ventral tegmental area) is a small area in the basal midbrain which is a critical part of the brain's reward system. It sends projections to the "nucleus accumbens" that use the neurotransmitter dopamine. Addictive drugs universally increase the effects of dopamine in this system, whereas drugs that oppose dopamine produce anhedonia of the sort seen in depressed people. Dopamine-enhancers such as cocaine often relieve the lack-of-pleasure in depression, but the effects only last as long as a drug is present in the body: that is, they temporarily alleviate one of the main symptoms, but do not help to cure the disease.
Nucleus accumbens (NAc).
Long-term exposure to various unavoidable stress factors decreases dopamine release in the NAc shell, as it was shown in the forced swimming test, an animal model of depression.
Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
The anterior cingulate cortex is activated by negative experiences of many types, and consistently shows higher levels of activity in depressed people than in non-depressed people. The functions of the ACC are controversial, but one proposal is that it mediates the conscious experience of suffering. Several decades ago, trials were made of ablating parts of the ACC in an attempt to relieve intolerable pain in patients who were terminally ill. These patients reported that after the surgery, they could still perceive the physical sensations of pain, but they no longer found them distressing. (The effects of heroin and morphine are sometimes described in the same way.) Very recently, clinical experiments were made in using deep brain stimulation to temporarily inactivate the ACC in severely depressed patients. This was not effective in all cases, but in some patients very striking results were achieved, with a perceptible lifting of mood immediately apparent to the patient as soon as the stimulus was applied.
Subgenual cingulate.
Recent studies have shown that Brodmann area 25, also known as Subgenual cingulate is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression. This region is extremely rich in serotonin transporters and is considered as a governor for a vast network involving areas like hypothalamus and brain stem, which influences changes in appetite and sleep; the amygdala and insula, which affect the mood and anxiety; the hippocampus, which plays an important role in memory formation; and some parts of the frontal cortex responsible for self-esteem. Thus disturbances in this area or a smaller than normal size of this area contributes to depression. Deep Brain Stimulations of this area have been successful in reducing its elevated activity and thus curing depression in patients that could not be cured by anti-depressants.
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a chain of endocrine structures that are activated during the body's response to stressors of various sorts. It often shows increased activation in depressed people, but the mechanism behind this is not yet known.
Ventricles.
Multiple studies have found evidence of ventricular enlargement in people who have depression, particularly enlargement of the third ventricle. These observations are interpreted as indicating loss of neural tissue in brain regions adjacent to the enlarged ventricle, leading to suggestions that cytokines and related mediators of neurodegeneration may play a role in giving rise to the disease.
Altered neuroplasticity.
Recent studies have called attention to the role of altered neuroplasticity in depression. A review found convergence of three phenomena:
The conclusion is that disrupted neuroplasticity is an underlying feature of depression, and is reversed by antidepressants.
Large-scale brain network theory.
Instead of studying one brain region, studying large-scale brain networks is another approach to understanding psychiatric and neurological disorders, supported by recent research that has shown that multiple brain regions are involved in these disorders. Understanding the disruptions in these networks may provide important insights into interventions for treating these disorders. Recent work suggests that at least three large-scale brain networks are important in psychopathology:
Central executive network.
The central executive network is made up of fronto-parietal regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral posterior parietal cortex. This network is crucially involved in high level cognitive functions such as maintaining and using information in working memory, problem solving, and decision making. Deficiencies in this network are common in most major psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression. Because this network is crucial for everyday life activities, those who are depressed can show impairment in basic activities like test taking and being decisive.
Default mode network.
The default mode network includes hubs in the prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate, with other prominent regions of the network in the medial temporal lobe and angular gyrus. The default mode network is usually active during mind-wandering and thinking about social situations. In contrast, during specific tasks probed in cognitive science (for example, simple attention tasks), the default network is often deactivated. Research has shown that regions in the default mode network (including medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate) show greater activity when depressed participants ruminate (that is, when they engage in repetitive self-focused thinking) than when typical, healthy participants ruminate. Individuals suffering from major depression also show increased connectivity between the default mode network and the subgenual cingulate and the adjoining ventromedial prefrontal cortex in comparison to healthy individuals, individuals with dementia or with autism. Numerous studies suggest that the subgenual cingulate plays an important role in the dysfunction that characterizes major depression. The increased activation in the default mode network during rumination and the atypical connectivity between core default mode regions and the subgenual cingulate may underlie the tendency for depressed individual to get “stuck” in the negative, self-focused thoughts that often characterize depression. However, further research is needed to gain a precise understanding of how these network interactions map to specific symptoms of depression.
Salience network.
The salience network is a cingulate-frontal operculum network that includes core nodes in the anterior cingulate and anterior insula. A salience network is a large-scale brain network involved in detecting and orienting to salient external stimuli and internal events. Individuals who have a tendency to experience negative emotional states (scoring high on measures of neuroticism) show an increase in the right anterior insula during decision-making, even if the decision has already been made. This atypically high activity in the right anterior insula is thought to contribute to the experience of negative and worrisome feelings. In major depressive disorder, anxiety is often a part of the emotional state that characterizes depression.

New South Wales D55 class locomotive

The D55 class was a class of 2-8-0 steam locomotives built by Clyde Engineering for the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia.
Construction.
In 1916 Clyde Engineering were award a contract for the construction of 300 K class locomotives. Following experiments with Southern type valve gear on an earlier class, Chief Mechanical Engineer Edward Lucy proposed its installation on these locomotives. The use of Southern valve gear was rare on locomotives operating outside the United States of America. The Southern valve gear did not give as good steam distribution as was desirable, making the locomotives a little sluggish when hauling heavy loads, compared to the similar classes.
The first of the class entered traffic on 29 November 1918. Due to financial difficulties at Clyde Engineering, the next member did not appear for a further two years. Meanwhile the contract had been reduced to just 120 locomotives. All were in service by March 1925 and were fitted with Wampu tenders. The last 30 were fitted with self-cleaning smokeboxes and outside bearings on the lead pony trucks.
Operations.
The members of this class spent most of their days attached to depots at Enfield, Goulburn, Harden, Junee and Cowra operating on the Illawarra and Main South lines. They were seldom used on the Main Western or Main Northern lines. 
With the discontent and industrial action in the coalfields following World War II, it was decided in 1946 to convert seventy (70) of the class to oil burners. The 55 class was chosen as the outside valve gear gave more room for the installation of the new equipment, which included altered firebox and smokebox. The tenders were fitted with a fuel tank. The fuel oil was injected into the firebox by a jet of steam from the locomotive boiler, the flow being controlled by the fireman. The first six locomotives converted were fitted to burn distillate which was five times the cost of coal firing, although it was hoped that reduced servicing times would offset some of that extra cost. 
When cheaper crude oil became available, the locomotives were again modified to allow them to burn this heavier product. This required the installation of heating coils in the tank and pre-heating adjacent to the burner to ensure complete atomisation. A further 10 were converted in 1947, followed by another 54 in 1949. As the crisis passed, the oil burning locomotives were withdrawn as they were still four times more expensive to run than the coal fired ones. Sixteen were converted back to coal firing and the remainder stored. The last oil burning 55 class was 5591 which was withdrawn in February 1959.
A distinctive feature of the oil burning locomotives was a hinged lid provided over the chimney to protect the boiler tubes and flues from sudden cooling when the oil fire was cut off.
Although designed to work freight trains, two were modified with specially balanced coupled wheels to operate the "Cooma Mail" south of Goulburn. 
The last was withdrawn from Enfield Locomotive Depot in June 1967. Of the Standard Goods engines, the 55 class were thus the first to be retired.

The Koa Man

"The Koa Man" is an episode of the American television detective series "Hawaiian Eye".
Synopsis.
Hired by a Los Angeles legal partnership to locate Nancy Campbell, Tracy Steele is frustrated by the manager of her apartment building, who claims she doesn't live there. He is also disconcerted to find that a guy named Frank Ameria is tailing him. When cornered, Frank admits he is making sure Steele doesn't find Nancy Campbell. To Steele's further annoyance, an old Navy acquaintance, Harry Gulliver, turns up at the Hawaiian Village Hotel and also insists on following him around.
Steele locates Nancy's former employer, Susan Chang, who runs a dance studio. Susan won't tell Steele about Nancy at first, but later, when she spots Harry Gulliver lurking around, she decides to talk. Gulliver is Nancy's former fiance, and is now stalking her. He secretly hired Hawaiian Eye to find her, in order to kill her. Susan tells Tracy Steele where to find Nancy and her new boyfriend Frank Ameria, who is simply trying to protect her. Steele arrives in time to trick Harry Gulliver into surrendering.
Musical interlude.
All the Warner Brothers detective shows of the late 1950s and early 1960s had one or more musical interludes written into the teleplay. For this episode, Connie Stevens sang "How Sweet You Are" with the Shell Bar band accompanying her, while Tony Eisley danced with guest star Barbara Luna to a cha-cha version of "Tea for Two".
Episode notes.
This was a rare storyline for this show, the crux of the plot turning upon the cowardice of a main character. Adam Williams, the actor who played that character, was in real life a former Naval aviator who had won the Navy Cross.

Anna Wilhelmine of Anhalt-Dessau

Anna Wilhelmine of Anhalt-Dessau (b. Dessau, 13 June 1715 - d. Dessau, 2 April 1780), was a German princess of the House of Ascania from the Anhalt-Dessau branch.
She was the third (but second surviving) daughter of Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his morganatic wife Anna Louise Föhse.
Life.
As the favorite child of her father, Anna Wilhelmine was given the "Mosigkau" Manor near Dessau for her residence in 1742. The princess, who remained unmarried all her life, began renovations on her new home with an architect from the Saxon school. From 1757 she spent her summers in the new Mosigkau Castle.
Her talent in finances became renowned when her brother Maurice allowed her control over the administration of his household and possessions during the period of his fatal war injury in 1759.
In the year of her death, Anna Wilhelmine ordered the establishment of a "Noble lady's convent" (German: "Hochadligen Fräuleinstiftes") in Mosigkau Castle. The convent existed until 1945. Since then the Castle has been accessible as a museum.

Japanese American

Cultural profile.
Immigration.
People from Japan began migrating to the U.S. in significant numbers following the political, cultural, and social changes stemming from the 1868 Meiji Restoration. Large numbers went to Hawaii and to the West Coast. In 1907, the "Gentlemen's Agreement" between the governments of Japan and the U.S. ended immigration of Japanese unskilled workers, but permitted the immigration of businessmen, students and spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the U.S. The Immigration Act of 1924 banned the immigration of nearly all Japanese.
The ban on immigration produced unusually well-defined generational groups within the Japanese-American community. Original immigrants belonged to an immigrant generation, the Issei, and their U.S.-born children to the Nisei Japanese American generation. The Issei comprised exclusively those who had immigrated before 1924. Because no new immigrants were permitted, all Japanese Americans born after 1924 were—by definition—born in the U.S. This generation, the Nisei, became a distinct cohort from the Issei generation in terms of age, citizenship, and English-language ability, in addition to the usual generational differences. Institutional and interpersonal racism led many of the Nisei to marry other Nisei, resulting in a third distinct generation of Japanese Americans, the Sansei. Significant Japanese immigration did not occur again until the Immigration Act of 1965 ended 40 years of bans against immigration from Japan and other countries.
The Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted naturalized U.S. citizenship to "free white persons", which excluded the Issei from citizenship. As a result, the Issei were unable to vote and faced additional restrictions such as the inability to own land under many state laws.
Japanese Americans were parties in several important Supreme Court decisions, including "Ozawa v. United States" (1922) and "Korematsu v. United States" (1943). The Korematsu case originated the "strict scrutiny" standard, which is applied, with great controversy, in government considerations of race since the 1989 "Adarand Constructors v. Peña" decision.
In recent years, immigration from Japan has been more like that from Western Europe. The numbers involve on average 5 to 10 thousand per year, and is similar to the amount of immigration to the U.S. from Germany. This is in stark contrast to the rest of Asia, where family reunification is the primary impetus for immigration. Japanese Americans also have the oldest demographic structure of any non-white ethnic group in the U.S.
Generations.
The nomenclature for each of their generations who are citizens or long-term residents of countries other than Japan, used by Japanese Americans and other nationals of Japanese descent are explained here; they are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation ("sei" 世). The Japanese American communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like "Issei", "Nisei", and "Sansei", which describe the first, second, and third generations of immigrants. The fourth generation is called "Yonsei" (四世), and the fifth is called "Gosei" (五世). The term "Nikkei" (日系) encompasses Japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations.
The "kanreki" (還暦), a pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of Japanese-American "Nisei." Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this traditional Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.
Languages.
"Issei" and many "nisei" speak Japanese in addition to English as a second language. In general, later generations of Japanese Americans speak English as their first language, though some do learn Japanese later as a second language. In Hawaii however, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state's residents across ethnicities. It is taught in private Japanese language schools as early as the second grade. As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese subtexts are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese language newspapers and magazines, although these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the local (Hawaii-born) Japanese population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the U.S., many "nisei" and "sansei" intentionally avoided learning Japanese. But as many of the later generations find their identities in both Japan and America or American society broadens its definition of cultural identity, studying Japanese is becoming more popular than it once was.
Education.
Japanese American culture places great value on education and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with a strong desire to enter the rigors of higher education. Because of such widespread ambition among members of the Japanese-American community, math and reading scores on the SAT and ACT may often exceed the national averages. Japanese-Americans have the largest showing of any ethnic group in nationwide Advanced Placement testing each year.
A large majority of Japanese Americans obtain post-secondary degrees. Japanese Americans often face the "model minority" stereotype that they are dominant in math- and science-related fields in colleges and universities across the United States. In reality, however, there is an equal distribution of Japanese-Americans between the arts and humanities and the sciences. Although their numbers have declined slightly in recent years, Japanese Americans are still a prominent presence in Ivy League schools, the top University of California campuses including UC Berkeley and UCLA, and other elite universities. The 2000 census reported that 40.8% of Japanese Americans held a college degree.
In the years prior to World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parent were worried that their child might go through the same discrimination when going to school so they gave them choice on going back to Japan to be educated or to stay in America with their parent and study both.
Intermarriage.
Before the 1960s, the trend of Japanese Americans marrying partners outside their racial or ethnic group was generally low, as well a great many traditional "Issei" parents encouraged "Nisei" to marry only within their ethnic/cultural group. Arrangements to purchase and invite picture brides from Japan to relocate and marry "Issei" or "Nisei" males was commonplace. 
In California and other western states until the end of World War II, there were attempts to make it illegal for Japanese and other Asian Americans to marry European Americans, but those laws were declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, like the anti-miscegenation laws which prevented European Americans from marrying African Americans in the 1960s.
According to a 1990 statistical survey by the Japan Society of America, the "Sansei" or third generations have an estimated 20 to 30 percent out-of-group marriage, while the 4th generation or "Yonsei" approaches nearly 50 percent.
During the World War II Internment era, the U.S. Executive Order 9066 had an inclusion of orphaned infants with "one drop of Japanese blood" (as explained in a letter by one official) or the order stated anyone at least one-sixteenth Japanese (descended from any intermarriage) lends credence to the argument that the measures were racially motivated, rather than a military necessity.
There were sizable numbers of Korean-Japanese, Chinese-Japanese, Filipino-Japanese, Mexican-Japanese, Native Hawaiian-Japanese and Cherokee-Japanese in California according to the 1940 U.S. Census who were eligible for internment as "Japanese" to indicate the first stage of widespread intermarriage of Japanese Americans, including those who passed as "white" or half-Asian/European.
Religion.
Japanese Americans practice a wide range of religions, including Mahayana Buddhism (Jōdo Shinshū, Jōdo-shū, Nichiren, Shingon, and Zen forms being most prominent) their majority faith, Shinto, and Christianity. In many ways, due to the longstanding nature of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japanese society, many of the cultural values and traditions commonly associated with Japanese tradition have been strongly influenced by these religious forms.
A large number of the Japanese American community continue to practice Buddhism in some form, and a number of community traditions and festivals continue to center around Buddhist institutions. For example, one of the most popular community festivals is the annual Obon Festival, which occurs in the summer, and provides an opportunity to reconnect with their customs and traditions and to pass these traditions and customs to the young. These kinds of festivals are mostly popular in communities with large populations of Japanese Americans, such as Southern California and Hawaii. It should be noted however, that a reasonable number of Japanese people both in and out of Japan are secular, as Shinto and Buddhism are most often practiced by rituals such as marriages or funerals, and not through faithful worship, as defines religion for many Americans.
Many Japanese Americans practice Christianity. Among mainline denominations the Presbyterians have long been active. The First Japanese Presbyterian Church of San Francisco opened in 1885. There is also the Japanese Evangelical Missionary Society (JEMS) formed in the 1950s. It operates Asian American Christian Fellowships (AACF) programs on university campuses, especially in California. The Japanese language ministries are fondly known as "Nichigo" in Japanese American Christian communities. The newest trend includes Asian American members who do not have a Japanese heritage.
Celebrations.
Japanese American celebrations tend to be more sectarian in nature and focus on the community-sharing aspects. An important annual festival for Japanese Americans is the Obon Festival, which happens in July or August of each year. Across the country, Japanese Americans gather on fair grounds, churches and large civic parking lots and commemorate the memory of their ancestors and their families through folk dances and food. Carnival booths are usually set up so Japanese American children have the opportunity to play together.
History.
People from Japan began emigrating to the U.S. in significant numbers following the political, cultural, and social changes stemming from the 1868 Meiji Restoration. Japanese immigration to the Americas started with immigration to Hawaii in the first year of the "Meiji period" in 1868. Following the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Japanese immigrants were increasingly sought by industrialists to replace the Chinese immigrants. In 1907, the "Gentlemen's Agreement" between the governments of Japan and the U.S. ended immigration of Japanese workers (i.e., men), but permitted the immigration of spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the U.S. The Immigration Act of 1924 banned the immigration of all but a token few Japanese.
During World War II, an estimated 120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals or citizens residing in the United States were forcibly interned in ten different camps across the US, mostly in the west. The internments were based on the race or ancestry rather than activities of the interned. Families, including children, were interned together. Decades later, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 officially acknowledged the "fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights" of the internment.
Politics.
Japanese Americans have shown strong support for candidates in both political parties. Shortly prior to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Japanese Americans narrowly favored Democrat John Kerry by a 42% to 38% margin over Republican George W. Bush. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the National Asian American Survey found that Japanese American favored Democrat Barack Obama by a 62% to 16% margin over Republican John McCain, while 22% were still undecided.
Japanese-Americans by state.
California.
The city of Torrance, California in Greater Los Angeles has headquarters of Japanese automakers and offices of other Japanese companies. Because of this many Japanese restaurants and other Japanese cultural offerings are in the city, and Willy Blackmore of "L.A. Weekly" wrote that Torrance was "essentially Japan's 48th prefecture".

Notable individuals.
Politics.
After the Territory of Hawaii's statehood in 1959, Japanese American political empowerment took a step forward with the election of Daniel K. Inouye to Congress. Spark Matsunaga was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1963, and in 1965 Patsy Mink became the first Asian American woman elected to the United States Congress. Inouye, Matsunaga, and Mink's success led to the gradual acceptance of Japanese American leadership on the national stage, culminating in the appointments of Eric Shinseki and Norman Y. Mineta, the first Japanese American military chief of staff and federal cabinet secretary, respectively.
Japanese American members of the United States House of Representatives have included Daniel K. Inouye, Spark Matsunaga, Patsy Mink, Norman Mineta, Bob Matsui, Pat Saiki, Mike Honda, Doris Matsui, and Mazie Hirono. Japanese American members of the United States Senate have included Daniel K. Inouye, Samuel I. Hayakawa, and Spark Matsunaga. In 2010, Inouye was sworn in as President Pro Tempore making him the highest-ranking Asian-American politician in American history.
George Ariyoshi served as the Governor of Hawaiʻi from 1974 to 1986. He was the first American of Asian descent to be elected governor of a state of the United States.

Sports.
Japanese Americans first made an impact in Olympic sports in the late 1940s and in the 1950s. Harold Sakata won a weightlifting silver medal in the 1948 Olympics, while Japanese Americans Tommy Kono (weightlifting), Yoshinobu Oyakawa (100-meter backstroke), and Ford Konno (1500-meter freestyle) each won gold and set Olympic records in the 1952 Olympics. Konno won another gold and silver swimming medal at the same Olympics and added a silver medal in 1956, while Kono set another Olympic weightlifting record in 1956. Also at the 1952 Olympics, Evelyn Kawamoto won two bronze medals in swimming.
More recently, Eric Sato won gold (1988) and bronze (1992) medals in volleyball, while his sister Liane Sato won bronze in the same sport in 1992. Hapa Bryan Clay won the decathlon gold medal in the 2008 Olympics, the silver medal in the 2004 Olympics, and was the sport's 2005 world champion. Hapa Apolo Anton Ohno won eight Olympic medals in short-track speed skating (two gold) in 2002, 2006, and 2010, as well as a world cup championship.
In figure skating, Kristi Yamaguchi, a fourth-generation Japanese American, won three national championship titles (one in singles, two in pairs), two world titles, and the 1992 Olympic Gold medal.

951 Gaspra

951 Gaspra is an S-type asteroid that orbits very close to the inner edge of the asteroid belt. Gaspra was the first asteroid ever to be closely approached when it was visited by the "Galileo" spacecraft, which flew by on its way to Jupiter on 29 October 1991.
Characteristics.
Apart from a multitude of small craters, Gaspra has half a dozen large flat areas and concavities. One of these flat areas, (Dunne Regio), is a 5×7 km area which is flat to within 200 m. It is uncertain whether these are the result of impacts or whether they are instead facets formed when Gaspra broke off its parent asteroid. In the weak, lopsided gravity of Gaspra, impact craters would naturally take on such flat, lopsided shapes, making this determination difficult. The flat facets and concavities give Gaspra a very angular appearance. 
Gaspra appears to be fairly olivine-rich among the S-type asteroids (the surface appears to contain olivine and pyroxene in the proportions 4:1 to 7:1). There are no prominent albedo or color patterns, although a subtle color variation is seen across the surface (see image above).
Gaspra's surface lacks unambiguous craters of a size comparable to its radius, like those seen for example on 253 Mathilde. A probable reason is that the collision that produced the Flora family and Gaspra was relatively recent on an astronomical timescale, so that Gaspra has not yet had the opportunity to acquire many large craters since. Analysis of cratering rates suggests the age of the surface is between about 20 to 300 million years.
Grooves about 100–300 m wide, up to 2.5 km long, and tens of meters deep are seen on Gaspra's surface, which may be related to Gaspra's formation along with the rest of the Flora family in an asteroid collision. Their presence also suggest that it is a single coherent body, rather than a rubble pile. The grooves were likely created by impacts that shattered the underlying rock. A system of much more prominent grooves is seen on the Martian moon Phobos. The pitted appearance of some grooves may suggest that the surface is covered by a regolith.
The extensiveness of regolith on Gaspra and its presence overall is a matter of debate, and not fully understood. Visually, the somewhat subdued and mantled appearance suggests a substantial regolith. Also, correlations are seen between the subtle color variations and local topography, and it has been suggested that this is caused by the slow migration of regolith to lower areas. It is, however, difficult to explain the origin of a putative regolith. Firstly, Gaspra's escape velocity is very small, so small that it is difficult to understand how it could keep a significant portion of fragments ejected by impacts from escaping. This may be alleviated if Gaspra is a porous body or started with a large regolith, but one has to explain how the original regolith appeared. A possible resolution of the issue may be that Gaspra obtained a regolith during the Flora-family forming impact that also created Gaspra itself. Secondly, it has been estimated that the matter ejected by all the craters would be only enough to cover Gaspra with 10 m of regolith. However, some craters are much deeper than this without showing any structural difference on their walls.
Gaspra's pole has been determined to point in the direction of RA 0h40m±10m, Declination 27±2°. This is equivalent to ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (21°, 20°) and gives an axial tilt of 72°.
The Galileo flyby was too distant for a body of Gaspra's small size to noticeably affect Galileo's trajectory, so no information on Gaspra's mass was obtained. (Galileo also visited 243 Ida where it discovered a moon, allowing a mass estimate there.)
Gaspra's surface area has been calculated at about 525 km², which, for comparison, is about the size of Guam, or half the land area of Hong Kong.
Exploration.
Gaspra was discovered by Russian astronomer G. N. Neujmin in 1916. Neujmin named it after Gaspra, a Black Sea retreat that was visited by his contemporaries, such as Gorky and Tolstoy. 
Galileo flew by Gaspra on 29 October 1991, passing within 1,600 kilometers at a relative speed of about 8 kilometers per second (18,000 mph). 57 images were returned to Earth, the closest taken from a distance of 5300 km. The best images have a resolution of about 54 meters/pixel. The area around the southern pole was not seen during the flyby, but the remaining 80% of the asteroid was imaged.
Because Gaspra's position was only known to within about 200 km before the encounter, and the camera's field of view was only about 5° across, Galileo would not know where to point to capture images of the asteroid once it was closer than 70,000 km. This would render the encounter not very interesting scientifically. To overcome this problem, a pioneering optical navigation campaign was implemented by the Galileo spacecraft team to reduce the uncertainty of Gaspra's position using images captured during the approach to Gaspra. This was spectacularly successful and allowed the spacecraft to obtain images from as close as 5300 km. At this closest range, the pointing was still not known quite accurately enough, but the camera actually took a 51 image mosaic so as to capture Gaspra on at least one image. Similar optical navigation techniques have been used on all spacecraft flybys of asteroids since.

Wilderness Canoe Base

Wilderness Canoe Base borders the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness on Seagull Lake near the end of the Gunflint Trail, about 50 miles from Grand Marais, Minnesota, USA. Part of the camp is on the northern half of Fishhook Island and another tract resides on nearby Dominion Island. It has been under the management of Lake Wapogasset Lutheran Bible Camp, Inc. since 2002.
Ham Lake fire.
Almost one third of the 138 structures destroyed by the Ham Lake fire in May 2007 were part of Wilderness Canoe Base. Of the camp's 60 structures, 40 were consumed by flames, including outhouses and staff cabins. A year later Wilderness raised nearly $200,000 to rebuild the camp. Another $100,000 came in the form of matching funds from Thrivent Financial for Lutherans. Reconstruction and fund-raising are ongoing as many of the structures have yet to be rebuilt.
History.
The first piece of land purchased in 1956 for $12,000 by Plymouth Christian Youth Center, included the upper half of Fishhook Island. Camp directors, Ham Muus and Bob Evans, led 120 boys in a camping experience which included little or none of the facilities that the camp enjoys today.
By 1958 the amount of facilities available at the camp increased several fold. Among many other structures, three log cabins, a boathouse, fourteen sleeping units, and a trail shack were all built by campers and volunteers. Most of these structures were erected in the course of a single year, beginning early in 1958.
Fully accredited by the American Camping Association in 1963, Wilderness Canoe Base operated under the Plymouth Christian Youth Center until 2002, when Lake Wapogasset Lutheran Bible Camp, Inc of Amery, Wisconsin agreed to manage the camp's ministry and programming.

Lady Gaga discography

The discography of American singer Lady Gaga consists of three studio albums, three compilation albums, four extended plays, nineteen singles (including three as a featured artist), four promotional singles, two video albums and twenty music videos. As of November 2013, she has sold an estimated 24 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. She has also sold around 7.25 million singles in the United Kingdom.
Gaga made her debut in August 2008 with the studio album "The Fame", an album that drew inspiration from '80s music while incorporating dance music and clear hooks. "The Fame" peaked at number two in the United States and was subsequently certified triple platinum while also seeing large success in Europe where it topped the charts in Germany and the United Kingdom. Its first two singles, "Just Dance" and "Poker Face", both were worldwide success, reaching number one in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and the United States. The album spawned three more singles: "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)", "LoveGame" and "Paparazzi", the latter, reached the top ten in many countries worldwide, including number one in Germany.
The commercial and critical success of her first album led to plans of a deluxe edition titled "The Fame Monster" which was ultimately released as a standalone EP in November 2009. It peaked at number one in Australia and reached number five in the United States, where it was certified platinum. Its lead single, "Bad Romance", became an international hit and reached number one in twelve countries while peaking at number two in the United States. Subsequent singles, "Telephone" and "Alejandro", were top ten hits in many countries. As of April 2012, combined sales of "The Fame" and "The Fame Monster" had reached in excess of 15 million copies worldwide. Consisting of various remixes of songs from both "The Fame" and "The Fame Monster", Gaga's first compilation album "The Remix" was released in 2010. It peaked at number six in the United States while reaching the top five in Canada and the United Kingdom. The remix album has sold 500,000 copies worldwide, therefore making it one of the best-selling remix albums of all time.
The singer's second studio album "Born This Way" was released in May 2011 and reached the number-one spot in the United States along with twenty other countries. The album's eponymous lead single "Born This Way" was an international hit, peaking at number one in nineteen countries including the United States, where it became her third number-one single. The other singles from the album were "Judas", "The Edge of Glory", "You and I" and "Marry the Night". Gaga's third studio album, "Artpop", was released in November 2013 and includes the singles "Applause" and "Do What U Want". In late 2014 Gaga and Tony Bennett will release the album "Cheek to Cheek".

The Girl from Utah

The Girl from Utah is an Edwardian musical comedy in two acts with music by Paul Rubens, and Sidney Jones, a book by James T. Tanner, and lyrics by Adrian Ross, Percy Greenbank and Rubens. The story concerns an American girl who runs away to London to avoid becoming a wealthy Mormon's newest wife. The Mormon follows her to England, but she is rescued from a bigamous marriage by a handsome actor.
The piece opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 18 October 1913 and had an initial run of 195 performances. An American version was produced by Charles Frohman that had a successful run of 140 performances at the Knickerbocker Theatre, opening on August 14, 1914. Frohman hired the young Jerome Kern to write five new songs for the score together with lyricist Herbert Reynolds to strengthen what he felt was a weak first act. Julia Sanderson and Donald Brian starred in the production. Their song "They Didn't Believe Me" became a hit. The musical also toured in other countries, including South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
"They Didn't Believe Me", with its conversational style and modern 4/4 time signature instead of the older waltz style, put Kern in great demand on Broadway and established a pattern for musical comedy love songs that lasted through the 1960s. It became a standard and has been recorded by many artists.

Toutatis

Toutatis or Teutates was a Celtic god worshipped in ancient Gaul and Britain. On the basis of his name's etymology, he has been widely interpreted to be a tribal protector. Today, he is best known under the name Toutatis (pronounced in Gaulish) through the Gaulish oath/catchphrase "By Toutatis!", invented for the "Asterix" comics by Goscinny and Uderzo. The spelling Toutatis, however, is authentic and attested by about ten ancient inscriptions. Under the spelling Teutates, the god is also known from a passage in Lucan.
The name "Teutates" is derived from the stem "teutā-" meaning "people" or "tribe", cognate with the Germanic "*þeudō".
Literary evidence.
Teutates was one of three Celtic gods mentioned by the Roman poet Lucan in the 1st century AD, the other two being Esus ("lord") and Taranis ("thunderer"). According to later commentators, victims sacrificed to Teutates were killed by being plunged headfirst into a vat filled with an unspecified liquid. Present-day scholars frequently speak of "the "toutates"" as plural, referring respectively to the patrons of the several tribes. Of two later commentators on Lucan's text, one identifies Teutates with Mercury, the other with Mars.
Epigraphic and other evidence.
Teutates was worshipped especially in Gaul and in Roman Britain. Inscriptions to him have been recovered in the United Kingdom, for example that at Cumberland Quarries (RIB 1017), dedicated to Jupiter Optimus Maximus and Mars Toutatis. Two dedications have also been found in Noricum and Rome. Another inscription found in Galicia probably also contains a dedication to Teutatis; place-names in Asturias and Leon have been associated with Teutates under the name of Teleno.
Gallo-Roman interpretation.
As noted above, among a pair of later reviewers on Lucan's work, one identifies Teutates with Mercury and Esus with Mars. At times the Gaulish “Mercury” may have the characteristic of a warrior, while the Gaulish “Mars” may act as a god of protection or healing.
Paul-Marie Duval argues that each tribe had its own "toutatis"; he further considers the Gaulish Mars the product of syncretism with the Celtic "toutates", noting the great number of indigenous epithets under which Mars was worshipped.
Tot finger rings.
A large number of Romano-British finger rings inscribed with the name "TOT", thought to refer to Toutatis, have been found in eastern Britain, the vast majority in Lincolnshire, but some in Bedfordshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire. The distribution of these rings closely matches the territory of the Corieltauvi tribe. In 2005 a silver ring inscribed "DEO TOTA" ("to the god Toutatis") and "FELIX" ([use this ring happily") was discovered at Hockliffe, Bedfordshire. This inscription confirmed that the inscription "TOT" did indeed refer to the god Toutatis.
In 2012 a silver ring inscribed "TOT" was found in the area where the Hallaton Treasure had been discovered twelve years earlier. Adam Daubney, an expert on this type of ring, suggests that Hallaton may have been a site of worship of the god Toutatis.

Miroslav Havel (designer)

Miroslav Havel (26 May 1922 – 5 September 2008) was the chief designer for Waterford Crystal.
Born in Držkov, Czechoslovakia, he trained as a glass craftsman in Železný Brod and in the Academy of Art and Industrial Design ("Umprum") in Prague. During his study at Umprum, he interned in a glass factory in Světlá nad Sázavou owned by Karel Bacik. Bacik, who was losing control of his business as the Communist takeover progressed, migrated to Ireland, made plans to set up a glass factory there, and in 1947 sent for Havel to supervise the technical aspects of the factory.
There had been a glassmaking factory in Waterford in the previous century, but as nothing was left of that tradition, Havel created a production process from scratch, recruited skilled craftspeople from traditional glassmaking areas of Europe, set up training and apprenticeship programmes for Irish personnel, and designed new product ranges. In these product ranges, Havel attempted to reestablish continuity with the glassmaking tradition of Waterford City (Havel visited the National Museum to make detailed drawings of their collection of original Waterford glass), while serving the needs of contemporary consumers and working within the constraints of modern factory production.

Rodney Gordon

Rodney Gordon (2 February 1933 – 30 May 2008) was a British architect. He was the primary architect of the Tricorn centre, Portsmouth, and Trinity Square, Gateshead. Architecturally, his works were primarily in concrete; he was said to be a Brutalist and his buildings have been described as "dramatic, sculptural and enormous" as well as "futuristic".
Biography.
He was born on 2 February 1933 in Wanstead, east London to a Polish-Russian father and a Chilean mother, who was from the naval port of Punta Arenas, Tierra Del Fuego, the southernmost city on Earth, overlooking the Straits of Magellan. Situated astride one of the world's historic trade routes, its prosperity has risen and fallen with that trade. Gordon's mother Carmalita left there sometime in the 1920s and returned to London, England, where her parents had been living sometime before they left for Chile around 1903. They had initially come to London in the 1880s or 1890s to escape the Pogroms of Russia and Eastern Europe.
He went to University College Hospital Medical School at the age of 16 but then, two years later inspired by the Festival of Britain, he switched to the Hammersmith School of Building, going on to the Architectural Association School of Architecture, where he studied under the distinguished German Jewish modernist architect and urban planner Arthur Korn, before graduating in 1957. He then went to work at the London County Council (LCC) architects department for which he designed his first great work, the Michael Faraday Memorial at Elephant and Castle. In 1959 he was introduced to Owen Luder by a colleague from the LCC and by the end of the year he was working for him in the "Owen Luder Partnership" for which he designed the Eros House. In the 1970s he founded "Batir International Architects", which later became "Tripos Architects", with Ray Baum and Larry Abbot. It was during this time, at the age of 42, that he suffered a heart attack from overwork. In 1979 he designed his last work for Batir, a bronze- and aluminium-clad commercial complex on St James's Street, London.
Personal life.
He was married and had one child but was later divorced. He was a passionate skier and founded the "Uphill Ski Club" which helps teach the physically handicapped to ski.
He died on 30 May 2008 at the age of 75.

Kennedia nigricans (Black Kennedia or Black Coral Pea) is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.
It is a vigorous climber which can spread up to 6 metres in diameter or 4 metres in height and has dark green leaflets that are about 15 cm long. Distinctive black and yellow pea flowers are produced 
between July and November in its native range.
The species was first formally described as "Kennedya nigricans" by John Lindley in 1835 in "Edward's Botanical Register", where it was also labelled as Dingy Flowered Kennedya.
A cultivar known as "Kennedia nigricans" 'Minstrel' was registered with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority by Goldup Nursery of Mount Evelyn, Victoria in September 1985. This cultivar was selected from a batch of seedlings in 1983 and has a pale colouration instead of the yellow, which appears almost white.
Cultivation.
This plant is noted for its vigour and can be used to cover embankments or unsightly structures. 
The species is adapted to a range of soils and prefers a sunny position. It is resistant to drought and has some frost tolerance. The species can be propagated by scarified seed or cuttings of semi-mature growth, while the cultivar requires propagation from cuttings to remain true to type.

Henriette Amalie of Anhalt-Dessau

Princess Henriette Amalie of Anhalt-Dessau (7 December 17205 December 1793) was the fifth (fourth surviving) and youngest daughter of Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his morganatic wife, Anna Louise Föhse.
Life.
In 1741 the 21-year-old princess Henriette Amalie gave birth to an extramarital son. When she refused to marry the father — the son of a court retainer — she was banished from the Dessau court. During the next eleven years she lived as a nun in Herford. Later her father (who had himself fathered two illegitimate children) tried to find a suitable husband for her, but all marriage plans failed. In the meanwhile, she lived openly with the Baron of Rackmann, who was fifteen years her junior. Thanks to her intervention, he was raised to the rank of Imperial Count and Baron of Bangert.
Probably to be near her son (who had been placed in the care of a banker's family), Henriette Amalie acquired a large house in Bockenheim, later named the "Villa Passavant," then built the former Franck-school and finally the current Saint Elisabeth's hospital.
In 1753 the princess acquired a property with a house and orangery attached. She pursued extensive agriculture activities and made the estate virtually self-sufficient. She introduced silkworm (Bombyx mori) breeding, kept bees, and sold oranges from her own residence. Also, she fostered the cultivation of asparagus and the growing of other fruits and vegetables.
In Kreuznach she acquired the feudal estate () of Bangert and established there a small castle (today a public museum) in the classicist style to replace the old manor house; it was completed about 1775.
The princess managed her extended properties herself, and was also an enthusiastic farmer. Her financial acumen became the basis for an independent and free life. She was said to have been five times richer than the richest farmer in that region. With her wealth she supported numerous artists.
In 1771 she extended her country house with annexes to the castle. Approximately 700 works of art were exhibited in the "Galerie" of the first floor of the remodeled castle. Near the castle a "Marmorbad" was created. Around this time her son died at approximately 30 years of age, a victim of consumption.
In 1790 she acquired a Frankfurt townhouse in Eschenheimer lane.
When French revolutionary troops moved approached Frankfurt in 1792, Henriette Amalie fled to her native Dessau and moved into the "Palais Dietrich" (named after its former owner, her brother Dietrich, who had died in 1769).
Henriette Amalie herself died one year later, two days before her seventy-third birthday. She was buried in Dessau without any of her family members present for the funeral.

Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass

The Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass, or the Frazier Mountain Communities, in the San Emigdio Mountains is a region of California that includes Lebec, Frazier Park, Lake of the Woods, Pinon Pines, and Pine Mountain Club, in Kern County, Gorman in Los Angeles County and Lockwood Valley within Kern and Ventura counties They are all within or near the Tejon Pass, which links Southern California with the San Joaquin Valley. Also sometimes included within the communities are Cuddy Valley, Grapevine, Neenach and New Cuyama.
Although the communities are divided among three counties (four, if New Cuyama, which is in Santa Barbara County, is included), they are tied together by the local newspaper, the "Mountain Enterprise", the Mountain Communities Chamber of Commerce, and the Ridge Route Communities Museum and Historical Society. All the communities are unincorporated areas, and all are served by their respective county agencies, such as sheriff's departments and county fire departments.
Population.
"The source for this section is the U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder."
A total of 6,066 people lived within the four areas of the Mountain Communities that were distinguished in the March 2000 U.S. census — 2,348 in Frazier Park, 1,600 in Pine Mountain Club, 1,285 in Lebec, and 833 in Lake of the Woods. There were 3,931 housing units — houses, apartments, trailers, etc. — of which only 2,392 were occupied.
The area's residents were older than the U.S. median — which was 35.3 years of age at the time. Pine Mountain Club was the “oldest” community — the median age being 45 and 15 percent of the residents being older than 65. Lake of the Woods’s median age was 39, with 14 percent of its population over 65, Frazier Park’s median age was 38, with 10 percent of its residents over 65, and Lebec had a median age of 36, with 13 percent over 65.
By another measurement, Lebec was the “youngest" town. Eight percent of its residents were under age 5, compared to six percent in Frazier Park and five percent in Pine Mountain Club and Lake of the Woods.
The Mountain Communities were overwhelmingly white — 91 percent in Pine Mountain Club, 88 percent in Frazier Park, 87 percent in Lake of the Woods, and 79 percent in Lebec. Latinos or Hispanics of any race amounted to 20 percent in Lebec, 12 percent in Frazier Park, 11 percent in Lake of the Woods, and nine percent in Pine Mountain Club.
Reported yearly incomes for each person in the labor force were $25,465 (in 1999 dollars) in Pine Mountain Club, $19,302 in Frazier Park, $17,983 in Lake of the Woods, and $14,895 in Lebec.
Pine Mountain Club also had the highest household and family incomes (at a median of $45,250 and $62,750, respectively), Frazier Park was next with $40,721 and $46,857, Lake of the Woods showed $42,742 and $43,468, and Lebec trailed with $39,063 and $40,972. To measure the income of a household, the pre-tax money receipts of all residents over the age of 15 over a single year were combined. Family income measured households with two or more people related through blood, marriage, or adoption.
Educational levels correlated to a large degree with income: Thirty-one percent of Pine Mountain Club residents had bachelor’s degrees or higher, compared to 22 percent in Lake of the Woods, 15 percent in Frazier Park and 12 percent in Lebec.
But Pine Mountain Club had the highest percentage of people whose incomes were below the poverty level — 17 percent (193 people), with Lake of the Woods following at 14 percent (119 people), Frazier Park at 12 percent (291 people) and Lebec last at eight percent (100 people). "(see Poverty in the United States#Measures of poverty for a discussion on problems with the official measurements of poverty in the United States.)"
Housing.
"The source for this section is the U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder."
The utilization by Mountain Community property owners of residences as second homes, vacation homes or seasonal rental properties can be shown by the fact that 62 percent of the 1,737 Pine Mountain Club houses (1,069) were vacant in March 2000 when the census was taken. In Lake of the Woods, the vacancies were 27 percent (or 129 of 475 housing units); Frazier Park, with 23 percent (or 281 of 1,203 units) and in Lebec, there were only 60 vacancies of 516 units, or 12 percent. All those figures in these mountainous communities were higher than that for the country as a whole — nine percent.
The vacancies correlated with the elevation of the communities — 5,554 feet for Pine Mountain Club, 5,121 feet for Lake of the Woods, 4,767 feet for Frazier Park, and 3,481 feet for Lebec. Elevation generally corresponds to snow levels in the winter.
Lebec had the highest valuation of single-family owner-occupied homes. The median, as identified by the census respondents, was $163,600 for 104 houses in Lebec, $144,500 for 453 houses in Pine Mountain Club, $96,800 for 636 such houses in Frazier Park, and $89,700 for 187 in Lake of the Woods. The median is the point at which half the homes were valued for more and half for less. These figures are not the same as actual real-estate sales. Neither do they reflect the value of second or vacation homes, or houses rented out.
Of the occupied residences, Pine Mountain Club, which is a private community, had the highest ratio of owner-occupied units — 84 percent, followed by Frazier Park and Lebec, each with 70 percent, and Lake of the Woods, 69 percent. The rest were occupied by renters.
"Notes: "Native Americans" includes Alaska natives. "Family income" is median family income in 1999 dollars. "Med. home value" is the median value of single-family houses. The "vacancy rate" is based on vacant housing units of any type in March 2000. Some figures have been rounded."
Government.
Town Council.
As unincorporated areas, the Mountain Communities have no local government, but they were served by the volunteer Mountain Communities Town Council, formed in 1995 "to provide a stronger local voice in community development" and to be "a liaison between various government agencies and the community at large." The first officers were Bob Anderson, president; Fred Rose, vice president; Richard Haugh, treasurer, and Ana Soares, secretary. The highest number of votes cast was 184 for Sanchez.
Electioneering was frustrating for council members because Kern County officials denied their request to allow a vote at the same time residents balloted in county elections. The council also tried putting a mail-in ballot in the local newspaper.
As a result, a proposal was made in 2006 to the local county supervisor, Raymond A. Watson, to strengthen the council, but, according to the local newspaper, it "received a chilly response." Rose said that Watson rejected a proposal to establish an elected municipal advisory council as allowed by state law.
During the 2004-2009 period, the council held a number of forums, which attracted more than a thousand people considering subjects ranging from wildfire evacuations to land-development proposals. In 2007, the California Air Resources Board lent it equipment to test air quality in Lebec.
The Town Council lapsed, with its last meeting held on October 16, 2008. At that time, the council decided to bring the matter of a municipal advisory council — or MAC — before Watson again.
Municipal Advisory Council.
Rose thereupon sent a letter to Watson on behalf of a "Mountain Communities MAC/CSD Working Group" for establishment of an elected municipal advisory council, or MAC, with a budget of $10,000, along with a part-time clerk and space at the supervisor's office in Frazier Park. It would cover only the Kern County part of the Mountain Communities.
Watson responded to a query from "The Mountain Enterprise" that
I am opposed to any new layer of government that adds significant costs and bureaucracy. … The idea of a municipal advisory committee or perhaps some other local representative would be strictly advisory. Ultimately, decisions for the Mountain Communities will lie with the elected Supervisor, whoever that is."
On February 23, 2009, an open meeting of about 75 people was held in Frazier Park under the control of Supervisor Watson. A poll by show of hands revealed about 40 in favor of a MAC, 7 opposed, and 20 undecided, with others not voting.
On August 14, 2009, Watson announced he would recommend the formation of a Municipal Advisory Council to the Kern County Board of Supervisors, with the first members to be
In 2013 the organization, dubbed MCMAC, contained 4,370 registered voters among the area's 8,384 Kern County residents.
Few local residents, however, attended the council's meetings. MacKay resigned from the body after five months, saying that it had been "hijacked" by Watson to be a rubber stamp and that she was appointed for "token diversity." Watson appointed nobody to fill MacKay's seat.
The people of the mountain communities began to boycott the meetings. The MCMAC often met to empty rooms: four people talked to each other and empty chairs for nearly three years.
In April 2012, however, both candidates to succeed Watson—David Couch and Harley Pinson—each said at a pre-election meeting in Frazier Park that he favored an elected Mountain Communities Advisory Council. and after Couch won the election, the remaining four council members resigned their positions.
Education.
El Tejon Unified School District.
The El Tejon Unified School District serves the entire mountain community: Lockwood Valley is part of the district even though it is within Ventura County, and Gorman students are accepted into the high school by special permit.
Frazier Park Elementary School educates children in kindergarten through third grade. El Tejon Middle School in Lebec takes district students from the fourth through the eighth grade. Frazier Mountain High School, also in Lebec, was founded in 1995 for ninth- through 12th-graders.
Pine Mountain Learning Center is a district-sponsored charter school 3.5 miles west of Pine Mountain.
Gorman Joint School District.
Gorman children and others from outside the district are educated in the small Gorman Elementary School from kindergarten through eighth grade.
Other education.
Home-schooling is important in the Mountain Communities, according to a March 2008 report in the "Mountain Enterprise," which added:
Per capita, the Mountain Communities may have one of the highest rates of homeschooling in the state, far above the national average of 2 to 4 percent, Holly Van Houten home-school parent of the area . . . said. Estimates range between 8 and 30 percent—somewhere between 100 and 400 children, she reports.
Frazier Park hosts a branch of the Charter Oaks Community Charter School, headquartered in Bakersfield. The charter school is designed to "provide opportunities, support, and accountability for parents in their homeschooling endeavors."

Sweetwater Mountains

The Sweetwater Mountains (highest peak Mount Patterson ) is a small mountain range in Northern Mono County, California and Western Lyon County, Nevada, separating the West Walker River from the East Walker River. Most of the range is only accessible by four wheel drive vehicle, on foot, or pack animal. Most of the range is contained in the Toiyabe National Forest. The place name appears on the 1874 California Geologic Survey map of California and Nevada. The Sweetwater post office existed on the eastern boundary of the range in the 1920s.
The ghost towns of Belfort and Clinton are small gold mining camps on the south-eastern slope of Mt. Patterson. There are several other inactive small gold mining camps and gold mines in the range, including Boulder Flat, Montague Mine, Angelo Mission Mine, Kentuck Mine, Frederick Mine, Longstreet Mine, Lilly Mine, Deep Creek Mine, and Tiger Mine. The area roughly forming a SE quadrant from the summit of Mt Patterson, bounded by Sweetwater Canyon (easterly line) and Frying Pan Canyon (southerly line), is known as the Patterson Mining District of Mono County according to the 1888 report of the State of California Mineralologist. The 1888 report also records the Cameron mining camp, which is now unknown. At least one mining company issued stock: Monte Cristo Consolidated Mining Company, 100,000 shares issued in 1887 at $10 each.
The Sweetwater Mountains geology largely consists of a pluton surrounded by igneous flow from the Little Walker Caldera.

Banksia sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla

"Banksia sphaerocarpa" var. "dolichostyla", commonly known as Ironcap Banksia, is a plant which is either considered a variety of "Banksia sphaerocarpa", or as a species in its own right. It is native to the Southwest Botanical Province of Western Australia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 33 days to germinate.
Description.
The Ironcap Banksia is an open, spreading, woody shrub some high by up to wide. The foliage is glaucous (pale blue-grey), with bright green new growth. The roundish to elongated golden-yellow inflorescences appear in autumn, larger and more elongate than spherical as with the other forms of "B. sphaerocarpa". It derives its name from its 50–65 mm long pistils, the longest of any banksia, and perianth (49-55 mm). The grey old flowers remain on the old cones.
Taxonomy.
First collected by botanist Alex George in 1978, it was officially described in the 1981 revision of the genus "Banksia" as a variety of "Banksia sphaerocarpa". The specific epithet was derived from the Ancient Greek words "dolichos" "long" and "stylos" "pillar", in reference to the long styles.
Botanist and plant taxonomist Kevin Thiele analysed the morphometrics in his cladistic paper of 1996, and announced that the Ironcap banksia warranted specific status. He analysed "Banksia micrantha" as the sister group to the pair of "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "sphaerocarpa" and "B. sphaerocarpa" var. "caesia", and noted that the Ironcap banksia, which was a sister taxon to this combined group, had stouter old styles on old cones which did not curl around, while those of the other varieties curled around the infructescence to form a ball.
George replied in the 1999 Flora of Australia treatment of "Banksia" that he did not feel this character alone justified specific rank, and that otherwise the plant was merely larger in all parts to var. "caesia" but essentially similar.
In 2002, Mast's molecular study yielded a surprise when molecular analysis mapped out the Ironcap banksia as a sister taxon to its geographical neighbour "B. violacea" in a larger group together with "B. laricina" and "B. incana". "Banksia micrantha" and the two remaining "sphaerocarpa" varieties form a related group.
Conservation.
"Banksia sphaerocarpa" var. "dolichostyla" has been declared Rare flora by the Western Australian state government; its status is deemed to be in the wild either rare, in danger of extinction, or otherwise in need of special protection, and have been gazetted as such, following approval by the Minister for the Environment, after recommendation by the State’s Endangered Flora Consultative Committee.

<doc id="19477807" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19477807" title="Cougar Dam">
Cougar Dam

Cougar Dam is a tall rockfill hydroelectric dam in the U.S. state of Oregon. It has a gated concrete spillway and a powerhouse with two turbines totaling 25 megawatts of electric power.
The dam impounds the South Fork McKenzie River about east of Eugene, Oregon, creating Cougar Reservoir which has a storage capacity of . The purpose of Cougar Dam is to provide flood risk management, hydropower, water quality improvement, irrigation, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, storage, and navigation.
In 2005, the Willamette temperature control facility was constructed to help regulate the water temperature released to the river below Cougar Dam in an attempt to reduce the negative effects on salmon migration. To further help recover threatened chinook salmon and bull trout populations, in the Willamette River Basin, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a fish collection and sorting facility on the South Fork McKenzie River below Cougar Dam which was completed in 2010. From 2003 to 2005, state-of-the-art turbine runners were installed in the turbine-generator units at the Cougar powerhouse, and were designed to resist cavitation and operate efficiently at very large head ranges.
Background.
Cougar Dam was completed in 1963 at a cost of $54.2 million and the two turbine units were completed in 1964. Cougar Dam is operated in coordination with Blue River Dam to control flooding, and since the completion of the dam, it is estimated that it prevented approximately $452 million in potential flood damages. The dam consists of a rock-fill embankment approximately long, a penstock to power two Kaplan turbines, an emergency spillway capable of a capacity of , a regulating outlet, and a diversion tunnel. The diversion tunnel was built to divert the South Fork McKenzie River during the construction of Cougar Dam, and the tunnel was later closed with a concrete plug once the construction of the dam was complete.
Temperature control tower.
The original intakes for the powerhouse and regulating outlet were deep and pulled water from the bottom of the reservoir which is much colder than the surface water. During the spring and summer, the release of unnaturally cold water into the McKenzie River reduces salmon migration and productivity. In the fall, the reservoir level is considerably lower and the warmer water from the surface enters the intakes and makes the river downstream unnaturally warm which causes salmon eggs to hatch several months too early. In order to help control the temperature of water discharged below the dam, the original intake tower was modified by adding a tall wet well. The wet well has three adjustable gates at various levels so that different temperature water can be mixed in the wet well to a desired temperature. The mixed water enters the existing regulating and penstock intakes. By controlling the temperature of the water released from the dam, the impacts on the McKenzie River are greatly reduced.
Fish collection and sorting facility.
When the Cougar Dam was originally constructed, it contained adult and juvenile fish passage facilities that helped fish move past the dam. However, fish no longer migrated to the facility, and it became ineffective. The Army Corps of Engineers decided to construct a new collection and sorting facility to collect, sort, and transport fish upstream and downstream of the dam. The new facility would cost $14.7 million and include a fish ladder, presort pool, sorting facility, and two pump structures for water supply. At the collection and sorting facility, adult salmon and bull trout will be loaded on trucks and released into high-quality habitats above Cougar Dam in an effort to recover threatened salmon and bull trout populations.
Replacement of turbines.
The runners from the two turbines in the Cougar powerhouse experienced significant cavitation damage during operation and by the 1980s they were in need of repair and had to be taken out of service four times a year for inspections and repair. In 1987, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed replacement runners that were designed by Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation. By 2000, the replacement runners were again experiencing cavitation problems and in need of repair. Repair of the runners would prove to be difficult because the runner blades are thin, making them difficult to weld, and the spacing between the blades is small which gives limited access to the damaged area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers realized that a state-of-the-art runner design was required and devised a turbine-generator rehabilitation program. Due to the technical challenges associated with the program, the Corps chose a best value procurement method for this project. In 2003, the contract was awarded to General Electric Hydro of Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the project was completed in March 2005. The project included physical model testing, new turbine runners, a major turbine overhaul, a generator rewind, and disassembly and reassembly of the units.
The problems with the runners for the turbines at Cougar powerhouse are associated with the cycle of large head changes of the Cougar Reservoir. Since Cougar Reservoir is built for flood control, the levels of the reservoir very greatly, causing the units to operate at heads between one third of the time and at heads between one fifth of the time.
In 2002, the Corps began lowering the level of the reservoir for the construction of a temperature control facility. The reservoir level was lowered to an elevation below the turbine intakes, which put the powerhouse out of service and provided an opportunity to overhaul the turbine-generator units.

HTTP+HTML form-based authentication

HTTP+HTML form-based authentication, typically presently colloquially referred to as simply form-based authentication, is a technique whereby a website uses a web form to collect, and subsequently authenticate, credential information from a user agent, typically a web browser. (Note that the phrase "form-based authentication" is ambiguous. See form-based authentication for further explanation.)
Interaction summary.
The steps of the technique are:
Adoption considerations.
HTTP+HTML form-based authentication is arguably the most prevalent user-authentication technique employed on the World Wide Web today. It is the approach of choice for essentially all wikis, forums, banking/financial websites, e-commerce websites, Web search engines, Web portals, and other common web-server applications.
This popularity is apparently due to webmasters or their employers wanting fine-grained control over the presentation and behavior of the solicitation for user credentials, while the default pop-up dialog boxes (for HTTP basic access authentication or digest access authentication) that many web browsers provide do not allow precise tailoring. The desired precision may be motivated by corporate requirements (like branding) or implementation issues (e.g., the default configuration of website software like MediaWiki, phpBB, Drupal, WordPress).

Jacopo II da Carrara

Jacopo II da Carrara (or Giacomo II) (died 1350), of the Carraresi family, was the "capitano del popolo" of Padua from 1345 until his death. Though he assumed power through forged documents and political murder, he was a patron of art and literature. He succeeded in bringing Francesco Petrarca to Padua for a time, and his own son, Francesco I, was an artisan. Jacopo also introduced the "carrarino" as the currency of Padua. 
In May 1345 Jacopo murdered the incumbent prince, Marsiglietto Papafava. He in turn was assassinated in 1350. At his death he was still illiterate, a fact he much regreted, as Petrus Paulus Vergerius wrote in a letter to his grandson Ubertino. His younger brother Jacopino succeeded him as "capitano", to be succeeded in turn by Francesco. In 1351 Petrarca wrote a eulogy for the deceased Jacopo, Andriolo de Santi was commissioned to carve his sepulchre, and Guariento di Arpo began work on a fresco of the coronation of the Virgin Mary to adorn his tomb in the church of Sant' Agostino (it was moved, following bombing during the Second World War, to the Church of the Eremitani).

Jacopo I da Carrara

Jacopo or Giacomo I da Carrara, called the Great (Grande), was the founder of the Carraresi dynasty that ruled Padua from 1318 to 1405. He governed with the advice of the leading citizens during a rule characterized by unity within the city. He is usually considered the first lord ("signore") of Padua, his election marking the transition from commune "ad singularem dominum" (to a single lord), a characteristic regime known as a "signoria" to contemporaries. 
Jacopo, a Guelph, led the Paduans to war against Verona in 1311 over the disputed possession of Vicenza. In response to the threat of the Ghibellines and continuous internal feuding, shortly after 25 July 1318 the Paduan aristocracy elected Jacopo as "defensor", "protector", and "gubernator" in perpetuity. Jacopo's election owed something to an alliance between Padua's own Ghibelline and Guelph factions, and after his election many Ghibelline exiles returned. Jacopo sent the poet Albertino Mussato, who objected to the "signoria" and pined for the old commune, into exile that year. In 1319 the Ghibelline Cangrande I della Scala besieged Padua and demanded the abdication of Jacopo in return for peace. Jacopo stepped down temporarily to save the city; the "signoria" was transferred to Frederick the Fair, a contender for the Holy Roman Empire. In the end Jacopo succeeded in preventing Padua from falling to either the Scaligeri or the Scrovegni. 
Jacopo was married to Anna, daughter of Pietro Gradenigo, Doge of Venice and Tommasina Morosini. Anna gave him one daughter, Taddea, and died in 1321. He himself died in 1324 and was buried in the Church of the Eremitani. Taddea moved to Venice on her father's death and there married Cangrande's nephew Mastino II della Scala in the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore.

Woodcroft College

Woodcroft College (commonly referred to as Woodcroft) is an independent, Anglican, co-educational, international, day school for students from Reception to Year 12, located on Bains Road in the southern Adelaide suburb of Morphett Vale. Despite being named for the southern Adelaide suburb of Woodcroft, the school is situated in the suburb of Morphett Vale. Founded in 1989, the College is currently celebrating its Silver Jubilee after 25 years of operation.
Woodcroft College is an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School and consequently, the Junior School runs on the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) whilst the Middle School and Year 10 students follow the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP). Year 11 and 12 students are offered three curriculum pathways; the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Vocational Education and Training (VET) and the IB Diploma Programme (DP). The College is also a member of the Council of International Schools (CIS).
The College Emblem.
The College emblem has individual elements that represent a particular value: an empty cross as a sign for hope; a serpent as a reminder of faith; a heart shaped shield as a token of love; and a 'W' inside the cross representing the Woodcroft College Community. The College colours of navy blue and gold are associated with the Patron Saint, Hilda of Whitby, while the red is a liturgical (seasonal) colour of the Christian churches.
Sub-Schools System.
Woodcroft College is divided into three sub-schools each with their own heads. The sub-schools, their Heads of School and year levels are as follows:
Each year level in the middle and senior schools each have a Year Level Manager (YLM) who effectively manages the students and issues that arise in that particular year level. The sub-schools also operate their own Student Leadership Teams which help raise issues with the appropriate YLM or Head of School.
House System.
All students at Woodcroft College are assigned to a house with all members of a family being assigned to the same house. The House System acts as the focus for families, sport and student leadership in the three Sub-Schools. In the Junior School the houses support sporting, cultural and co-curricular activities and its students compete within their classes and year levels earning points for their house in the annual Junior School Sports Day situated on campus. In the Middle and Senior Schools, these houses compete against each other in the annual Interhouse Swimming Carnival located at the SA Aquatic & Leisure Centre since 2012, and Interhouse Athletics Carnival located at Santos Stadium. Middle School students also compete in House Activities once every term - where students are split into several groups within their year level with each group consisting of students from the four houses - to earn further points for their house. The College's four houses are as follows:
The names of the four houses originated from famous influences and areas situated near or around the college:
Facilities.
Woodcroft College offers a variety of facilities, all set in spacious, landscaped grounds with modern buildings and extensive playing fields. Specialist teaching areas are well-equipped with up-to-date resources and information and communications technology. As of 2014, on campus facilities include:

Rollin Hotchkiss

Rollin Douglas Hotchkiss (1911 – December 12, 2004) was an American biochemist who helped to establish the role of DNA as the genetic material and contributed to the isolation and purification of the first antibiotics. His work on bacterial transformation helped lay the groundwork for the field of molecular genetics.
Education.
Hotchkiss was born in South Britain, Connecticut. The son of factory workers, he attended Yale University after scoring the highest in the nation on an achievement test. Hotchkiss earned a B.S. in chemistry in 1932, and remained at Yale for a Ph.D. in organic chemistry. After completing his doctoral work in 1935, Hotchkiss became a fellow of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research, where he would remain until retirement in 1982.
Research career.
At the Rockefeller Institute, Hotchkiss initially worked as an assistant to Oswald Avery and Walter Goebel, and was encouraged to learn more biology at a summer courses at the Marine Biological Laboratory. His early work isolating and synthesizing derivatives of glucoronic acid led to the identification of one of the specific polysaccharides in the capsule of type III pneumococci. Hotchkiss spent the 1937-1938 academic year in the lab of Heinz Holter and Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang at Carlsberg Laboratory learning protein analysis techniques. In 1938, he began collaborating with René Dubos to isolate and study antibiotics produced by soil bacteria. Their work on gramicidin and tyrocidine led to the first commercial antibiotics, and with Fritz Lipmann they found that the antibiotics include D-amino acids.
During the late 1930s, Hotchkiss was also strongly critical of the Bergann-Niemann hypothesis of protein structure, the proposal by fellow Rockefeller biochemists Max Bergmann and Carl Niemann that protein structures always consist of multiples of 288 amino acids. (This would also be a feature of Dorothy Wrinch's cyclol hypothesis of protein structure).
In 1946, in the wake of the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment showing that DNA, not protein, had the power to transform bacteria from one type to another, Hotchkiss rejoined Avery's lab. His work on protein analysis helped answer Avery's critics who argued that the experiment was not sufficiently rigorous to rule out protein contamination (and thus the possibility that protein was the transforming factor). Hotchkiss found that virtually all the detected nitrogen in the purified DNA used in for the transformation experiments came from glycine, a breakdown product of the nucleotide base adenine, and estimated that undetected protein contamination was at most .02%, although he did not publish this result until 1952 (the year of the Hershey-Chase experiment). In 1948 Hotchkiss used paper chromatography to quantify the base composition of DNA and, independently of Erwin Chargaff, found that the base ratios differed from species to species.
In 1951, Hotchkiss showed that purified bacterial DNA could be used to transfer penicillin resistance from one strain of bacteria to another without changing the capsule type (the main identifying feature of different types of the same bacterial species). His subsequent worked helped establish the basics of bacterial genetics, showing that many features of classical genetics (including genetic linkage) have parallels in bacteria, despite their lack of chromosomes. Hotchkiss continued working in molecular genetics until his retirement in 1982, including significant collaborations with Julius Marmur, Maurice Fox, Alexander Tomasz, Joan Kent, Sanford Lacks, Elena Ottolenghi, and his wife Magda Gabor-Hotchkiss.
In the mid-1960s, Hotchkiss became interested in the potential dangers of genetic engineering (a term he helped to popularize). Through the early 1970s he articulated many of the concerns that led to the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA.
Hotchkiss was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences (elected in 1961), and served as president of the Genetics Society of America from 1971 to 1972. After leaving Rockefeller University in 1982, he worked as a research professor at the University at Albany, SUNY until retiring to Lenox, Massachusetts in 1986. Hotchkiss died December 12, 2004 of congestive heart failure.

Loca Sanchez

Loca Sanchez, formerly known as Chesty Sanchez, is a fictional character and comic book superheroine created by Steve Ross. The character made her first appearance in "Chesty Sanchez" #1 (Nov. 1995) published by Antarctic Press.
Maria Sanchez was born in a small village near Cuernavaca, Mexico to a father who had prayed for a son. As if to compensate, Maria grew taller and stronger than any other man in her village. Discovered by a wrestling promoter, Maria began her lucha libre career under the tantalizing name "Chesty Sanchez". A scandal forced her to retire and return home to help with her parents' store. Due to her former popularity as a luchadora, the Frijoles de Oro food company approached Maria with an offer to become a real-life superhero and mascot of the Frijoles de Oro company. At most, this was merely a publicity stunt, but Maria agreed in order to help with her parents' expenses. Assisted by several supporting characters, including a side-kick named Trompeto, and utilizing her own athletic fighting ability, Maria has become an established and well respected crime-fighting celebrity in Mexico.
Publication history.
Steve Ross was approached by artist Lyndal Ferguson from Rock 'n' Roll Comics in the late '80s to create a story for an "all adult" comics anthology he was developing at the time. Ross created a story which featured more toilet humor than anything explicit and introduced a new "sexy" character for the anthology named Chesty Sanchez.
The name itself was intended to be ironic; while the character was curvy and voluptuous, she had very realistic proportions. Much of Chesty's visual design was based on Mexican actresses, singers and pop stars as Ross had wanted to avoid the exaggerated and over-sexed images that plagued female comic characters. Chesty was also one of the few American comics characters to have a lucha libre theme. As there were very few sources of information available in English, Ross relied mostly on classic Mexican wrestling films, including "Las Luchadoras contra la Momia" (Wrestling Women vs. The Mummy). Ross also incorporated influences from classic pulp superheroes such as Zorro, The Domino Lady, The Phantom Detective, and The Spider. Chesty's costume design was based entirely on the classic Mexican mariachi garb, with the exception of the domino mask which was intended as a nod to the aforementioned pulp figures.
After completing the story, Lyndal changed his anthology series to a single story-arc, one which did not feature Chesty Sanchez. Steve Ross was able to retain his rights to the newly created character, and presented it to Antarctic Press who was currently publishing his work on the Zetraman series. Antarctic was receptive to the idea and allowed Ross to pursue a three issue mini-series. Steve Ross wrote the script for the planned three-part story-arc, which would feature the origin of the Chesty Sanchez character, while interior artwork was completed by Scott Michaud. The mini-series was first published by Antarctic Press in 1995, which was later compiled into one ninety-six-page special issue.
The series is currently on hiatus, although Steve Ross plans for future installments under the more "family-friendly" name of "Loca Sanchez".
Fictional character history.
According to her origin story from "Chesty Sanchez" #1, Maria was born in a small village just outside of Cuernavaca. Maria grew stronger and taller than any other man in her village, and learned to defend herself. She was discovered at the age of nineteen by a vacationing wrestling promoter after roughing up one of the local street-punks. Traveling to Mexico City, Maria signed on as luchadora and began her wrestling career under the name of Chesty Sanchez. Due to a clerical error, Chesty's first match was scheduled to be with the male wrestler called El Terror Negro. Despite the mix-up, Chesty won the match and thereby the respect of the lucha libre fans. Chesty became a popular icon of the lucha libre circuit until allegations arose that she had been cheating in her matches and illegal drugs and dirty money where found in her dressing room. Unable to defend herself against such accusations, Maria resolved to retire and avoid the lime-light.
One day while working at her father's store, Maria was approached by taxi-driver Pedro "Trompeto" Alvarez, who reveals that Frijoles de Oro is in need of her talents. As a publicity stunt, Frijoles de Oro hires both Maria and Trompeto to act as Mexico's first superheroes. Maria reluctantly agreed to don her former persona of Chesty Sanchez, only to help with her parents' expenses. Given a new costume, advanced technology, and sidekick Trompeto, Maria could now wage a war on crime. It was during her first adventure that she discovered the drug and gambling scandal that ended her career was actually the work of some jealous rivals. Having her name cleared and saving Mexico from certain doom, Maria was once again popular with the citizens of Mexico City.
A cross-over all-text storyline with Ben Dunn's Warrior Nun Areala featured in Antarctic Press' Mangazine, revised much of the character's background. Maria is never referred to as "Chesty Sanchez" but instead earned the name "Loca Sanchez" due to her short temper in the ring. Maria was discovered by the vacationing wrestling promoter when she was beating up a local boy who had spread rumors that he ""had his way with her."" The promoter did not sign her on simply because of her impressive fighting ability, but more for the gimmick of having a woman fighter beat a man in the wrestling ring. The scandal that ended her career is shown to be much more damaging, costing her family much more in legal battles. The story also incorporated other independent characters such as Richard Dominguez's "El Gato Negro", Margarito C. Garza's "Relampago", Carlos Saldaña's "Burrito", and Laura Molina's "The Jaguar".
Skills, abilities, and resources.
Loca Sanchez is at the peak of physical fitness and using her natural fighting ability combined with her cunning in combat and lucha libre skills to fight villains ranging from the common street-thug to nefarious villains. She is also assisted in battle by her taxi-cab driving sidekick, Trompeto, and has access to a wide variety of technology supplied by the Frijoles de Oro research group.

Northwest A&amp;F University

Northwest A&F University (NWAFU, A&F referring to Agriculture and Forestry; simplified Chinese: 西北农林科技大学; pinyin: Xīběi Nónglín Kējì Dàxué; traditional Chinese: 西北農林科技大學), is a national key university located in Yangling Agricultural Hi-tech Industries Demonstration Zone, Shaanxi Province, P.R.China. The university has an old and abandoned name called Northwest Sci-tech University of Agriculture and Forestry, NWSUAF for short, which is still kept in the domain name of the university's official website.
The history of Northwest A&F University can be dated back to 1934 when National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry (simplified Chinese: 国立西北农林专科学校; traditional Chinese: 國立西北農林專科學校) was established by Ministry of Education, Republic of China based on an act drafted by Tai Chi-Tao, General Yang Hucheng and Yu Youren in 1932. This was the first national senior college with speciality on agriculture field in the north-west of China and was also the only independent senior college of its kind. Yangling, where the university is located, is believed as the birthplace of Houji, God of Abundant Harvests, and is the area where he taught people how to grow and harvest cereals. Since 1934, 7 academic institutions or universities resided here gradually and it is reputable as Town of Agriculture Sciences. Many achievements have been made by university, such as wheat cultivars Biman 1 (by Zhao, Hongzhang) and Xiaoyan 6 (by Li, Zhensheng) which were dominant wheat cultivars in Yellow River-Huai River Wheat Growth Area and significantly increased wheat quality and yield. The Ministry of Education and Shaanxi Province Government proposed to merge the 7 scientific organizations to 1 new University and finally get approved by State Council in 1999, thus establishing Northwest A&F University.
The university expanded rapidly and has Top 3 research and teaching quality in China’s agriculture universities and is a member of “Project 985” club which is an organization of 39 reputable universities in China. Northwest A&F University's research achievements are dominant in the fields of agriculture biology including wheat breeding, entomology, agriculture resource management, horticulture, plant protection, food science(especially in Enology), forestry and veterinary. Besides, the university is also reputable in agricultural water conservancy, agriculture economics and management, agriculture mechanics and information engineering and ancient agricultural history research.The university has an annual income of around RMB 1.72 billion (around £ 172 million) in 2011. By April 2013, the university has 1661 teachers and 28964 students.
Northwest A&F University provides courses covering agriculture, forestry, engineering, natural science, medicine, management and economy etc. to both native and international students. These courses are provided by 23 academic colleges. Students can choose one college to register and pursue their honour degrees at different levels including Bachelor, Master and PhD. Studentship and scholarship from governments and organizations are available to help students finish their studies.
Brief History.
Origins and Re-Organization.
Northwest A&F University was established on September 11, 1999 by merging 5 scientific research institutions and 2 universities in Yangling, Shaanxi Province, namely
The 7 members involved in re-organization were very close to each other historically. Northwest Agricultural University has the biggest area and the longest history out of 7 members and are the origin of Institute of Water Resource Sciences (Northwest China) and Northwest Forestry College. Her history can be dated back to 1934(Year 23 in Minguo calendar) when National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry (the predecessor of Northwest Agricultural University) was founded by the Senior Politician of Kuomintang Mr. Yu Youren, Kuomingtang veteran member Tai Chi-tao, Kuomingtang General Yang Hucheng .In 1937 and 1938, the Senior College merged with College of Agriculture of National Northwest Associated University and Department of Animal Husbandry in College of Agriculture of National Henan University (河南大学) respectively, then was renamed as National Northwest Agricultural College. Meanwhile, Department of Water Conservancy of National Lanzhou University （兰州大学） joined the College. Following the establishment of P.R.China in 1949, "National" was deleted from the College name although it remains a government funded academic school. In 1952, Department of Agricultural Water Conservancy was partially given to Xi'an Jiaotong University （西安交通大学） under the order of The State Council. 2 years later, the remained Department of Agricultural Water Conservancy became an independent academic institution which is the mold of Institute of Water Resource Sciences (Northwest China). In 1979, Northwest Forestry College came out to be an independent school from Department of Forestry in Northwest Agricultural College. In 1985, with the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fishery, the University name changed to be Northwest Agricultural University.
Other institutions have relatively shorter history. Institute of Botany (Northwest China) became an independent academy from Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (founded in 1956) in 1965. In 1980, Shaanxi Academy of Forestry got separated from Shaanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences (founded in 1952).
The State Council agreed to merge 7 organizations as new Northwest A&F University in a reply to the proposal drafted by Ministry of Education and Shaanxi Province Government. A financial budget of 600,000,000 RMB was granted as start fund and further investment plan as well as related issue such as reshuffle were also briefly stated in this official reply. On 11 September 1999, a central government delegation lead by Vice Premier Li Lanqing attended the opening ceremony and made the announcement.

The University urban area is around 3.94 km², covering two main campuses: North Campus and South Campus. Besides, Institute of Water and Soil Conservation, College of Food Science and Engineering and College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering have their own independent campuses for administrative affairs and research respectively. A 3D virtual campus map of A&F has been generated and its website is http://3dmap.nwsuaf.edu.cn.
Generally, South Campus is mainly served for senior undergraduates from College of Agriculture, College of Horticulture, College of Forestry, College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, College of Resource and Environment and College of Economics and Management. All students from International School, most of postgraduates, undergraduates from Department of Arts (Landscape Arts Design) and all students from College of Vocational and Adult Education also live and study in South Campus. Although North Campus is mainly for undergraduates of other colleges, some postgraduates move to North Campus for their research since they become the 2nd year students.
The Museum Garden (a collection of 5 museums including insects, animals, plants, soil and China's agricultural history) is located beside South Campus. The Insects Museum holds the most extensive collection of butterflies in China's Universities. This garden is also the greatest Agriculture-themed museum area in China.
A&F provides convenient sports facilities to her staffs and students. Across the campuses, there are 12 tennis courts, 1 indoor stadium, 2 outdoor stadiums, 1 arena for volleyball and basketball, 2 outdoor swimming pools, 48 outdoor basketball courts, 28 outdoor volleyball courts, several badminton courts and 143 outdoor tables for Ping-Pong. Students' basketball team and volleyball team gains reputation for University in sports competition with other fellow teams.
The university has 2 libraries with 1 in each main campus. Besides, a training centre for engineering (North Campus) provides engineering courses to all undergraduates, especially to those studying mechanics. For students in North Campus, lecture rooms and teaching labs mainly locates in a mansion (called No. 8 Teaching Building) of 10 floors plus 12 Great Lecture Halls. Also, a computer lab with 1000 computers allow students to study IT knowledge.
Wifi signal covers student dorms and teaching buildings all over the campuses and Internet sockets can be found in students dorms.
Chefs in 11 cafeterias scattered in the 2 main campuses (including 2 Muslim cafeterias) cook breakfast, lunch and supper to students and staff every day in each term. However, the cafeterias are usually very busy and crowded when it's dining time.
Totally 48 dorm buildings are available for students living.For Chinese students, 4 or 6 students share 1 bedroom while international students live in single or double bedroom equipped with bathroom and toilet(the price is much higher). Winter in northwest China is very cold and heating service is provided since 15 November to 15 March each winter in each dorm room.
In each main campus, Xiu-Shan Students Venue Centre is used as a place for exhibition, concert, gala and conference.

European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology

The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (formerly the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology) is an international organisation of national associations and of individual persons, constituted as an association pursuant to Article 60 "et seq." of the Swiss Civil Code. The Academy is currently domiciled in Zurich, Switzerland.
Purpose.
The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is a non-profit organisation active in the field of allergic and immunologic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, eczema, occupational allergy, food and drug allergy and anaphylaxis. EAACI was founded in 1956 in Florence, Italy and has become the largest medical association in Europe in the field of allergy and clinical immunology. It includes more than 7,800 individual members from 121 countries, as well as 42 National Allergy Societies.
The EAACI Constitution states:
The Academy shall be a non-profit organisation in the area of allergology and clinical immunology aimed at:
Sections.
In order to strengthen its influence on the work of the main clinical specialities where allergy and clinical immunology is of importance, the EAACI has formed five sections. These sections co-ordinate and represent the activities of all members and affiliates who have expressed a wish to join the Section and will act as a focus and point of contact for relevant specialty societies and non-members. The sections are: Asthma, Immunology, Dermatology, ENT, and Pediatrics.
Congress.
The EAACI organises its main congress each June. It includes scientific communication of abstracts (posters and oral communications), workshops and symposia. The congress features extensive multi-day scientific programmes, with 7,000-8,000 international participating delegates, providing in-depth understanding and discussion within targeted medical communities on topics such as:

Linebarrels of Iron

An anime adaptation of the manga series was announced in the February issue of "Animage" magazine. The anime is directed by Masamitsu Hidaka and animated by Gonzo. Though the world premiere of the first episode took place at Southern California's 2008 Anime Expo, the series premiered in Japan on the television network TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) on October 3, 2008. The anime broadcast a total of twenty-four episodes, the last of which aired on March 20, 2009. To commemorate the series' anime adaptation, Shimizu and Shimoguchi decided to create a one shot manga, recreating the entire first episode of the anime, in which the plot differs in many aspects compared to the beginning of the manga.
Plot.
The "Linebarrels of Iron" story takes place in a fictional alternate future, centering on a junior-high school student named Kouichi Hayase, who escaped his daily life of being bullied as a child by daydreaming about being a hero. His life was forever changed during a class trip in the year 2016 when an artificial satellite fell from orbit. Due to this "accident", Kouichi was left in a coma for half a year, and upon awakening, found himself with strange powers, including superhuman strength. Then, in 2019, a mysterious robot called "Linebarrel" appears before him. It is revealed that the accident from three years ago was not caused by a satellite, but rather by the Machina robot Linebarrel and that this turned him into a "Factor", which is the name given to Machina pilots. This leads him to encounter Emi Kizaki, a mysterious amnesiac girl whose unknown past seems to be related to Linebarrel. He joins her in fighting for JUDA, the world's largest medical equipment maker, which happens to secretly own several other Machina robots.
Machinas and Armas.
There are two kinds of robots in "Linebarrels of Iron": Armas and Machinas. The series primarily focuses on Machinas, robots which are not manufactured by humans and are powered by nanobots called D-S.O.I.L., also known as Drexler S.O.I.L., which also enable them to regenerate after being damaged. Since D-S.O.I.L. is like artificial muscle for the Machinas, they tend to "bleed" when they are damaged. 
Machinas are also considered to have their own consciousness, as only their chosen "Factor" can pilot one, and should the Factor be killed, it will go on to find a replacement. The overlying reason for this is that all Machinas are incapable of intentionally killing another human on their own volition; they need a "Factor" i.e. another human, who would be the one who "kills". Interestingly, the Factor need not be actively piloting the machina for it to kill, as revealed when a rampaging Machina called Apparition was brought down by JUDA and the then-unaligned Hayase and it was found that the (dead) Factor was drugged and restrained inside it. Should it kill someone without a Factor's "assistance", usually by accident, a Machina has been known to resuscitate and heal the person by injecting their D-S.O.I.L nanobots into them, which in turn makes the person a Factor. This is case for Factor Reiji Moritsugu. In the case of Kouichi Hayase, then-Linebarrel pilot Emi Kizaki begged Linebarrel to heal him, which turned him into a Factor, at the expense of making Emi a less desirable Factor to Linebarrel ("It" does not want Emi to fight). In the anime it was revealed that Hayase's friend Hideaki Yajima was also resurrected by the Machina that caused his death.
In addition, a Machina can go into Overdrive, or a state of rampage which exponentially increase its capabilities, when its Factor's emotions go out of control. Machinas can also be stored in another dimension and appear before its Factor any time, excluding the Linebarrel. However, they cannot teleport if the Factor is inside it. Since there are only a limited amount of Machinas available and their true origins are unknown, humans created Armas, which are crude imitations of Machinas and do not have D-S.O.I.L. They can be piloted by anyone, but they cannot regenerate, nor they can perform at the level of true Machinas.
Machina-Humans.
A concept not unveiled in the manga but one of the key ones of the anime is that of the "Machina-Humans". As the story unfolds it is learned that there exists a parallel universe adjacent to our own, where humanity reached incredible peaks of technology at the cost of their very nature, to the point where the human species as a whole became extinct after merging its own collective consciousness with the machines they created. Similar to a hive mind, this virtual collective unity threw away individuality and any sort of vestige of human feelings for the sake of power, becoming one cold, ruthless mechanical being bent on a continuous, endless expansion of itself. Referred to as "Central", this hive mind acts in a way reminiscent of the machines from the Matrix trilogy, even having its own enforcers to hunt down and destroy whoever is perceived as a hindrance.

Manga.
Written and illustrated by Eiichi Shimizu and Tomohiro Shimoguchi, the "Linebarrels of Iron" manga series was first serialized in Akita Shoten's monthly shōnen manga magazine, "Champion Red". The chapters of the series are still published in the magazine, and has since been compiled into twelve tankōbon as of March 19, 2009. This is excluding "Volume 0", which was simultaneously released with the fifth volume. Akita Shoten also published a book containing details about the anime adaptation, simultaneously releasing it on the same day as the tenth volume. The manga is published by Editorial Ivrea in Spain for readers of Spanish. The first four volumes of the manga had been already published.
To commemorate the series' anime adaptation, Shimizu and Shimoguchi decided to create a one shot manga which will be serialized in the forty-fourth issue of the Japanese manga magazine "Weekly Shōnen Champion". It recreates the entire first episode of the anime, in which the plot differs in many aspects compared to the beginning of the manga.
Anime.
The production of an anime adaptation for the "Linebarrels of Iron" manga was first revealed in Animate's preview information for the February issue of the anime and entertainment magazine "Animage". It was later announced that Masamitsu Hidaka, most well known as the director for the "Pokémon" anime series, will be directing Gonzo studio's anime adaptation.
Though the Japanese television premiere of the series was in October 2008, the world premiere of the first episode took place in the United States at Southern California's 2008 Anime Expo, which Masamitsu Hidaka attended as a Guest of Honor. An official English language "Linebarrels of Iron" website was put up just before the Anime Expo in order to promote the American premiere of the series. Other special screenings for the first episode also took place in France's Japan Expo in July and Germany's Animagic 2008 in August. The previewed first episode contained subtitles as it was still presented with its original Japanese dialogue.
The series first premiered on Japanese television on October 3, 2008. A total of twenty-four episodes aired, with the last of which being broadcast on March 20, 2009. Though the episodes aired first on the TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) television network, CBC and Sun-TV also broadcast the series; CBC aired it within an hour after TBS's initial broadcasts, and Sun-TV aired the episodes a week later.
In an agreement, in which Gonzo's corporate parent, the GDH group, decided to allow popular video-sharing websites to stream some of Gonzo's latest anime titles, Crunchyroll, an anime-sharing site, streams episodes of the "Linebarrels of Iron" anime two hours after its premiere in Japan. It is also illegally available on YouTube, though the only full episode available is episode one; Gonzo uploads only the first half of the following episodes, and to view the rest, viewers are directed to Crunchyroll.
As of March 25, 2008, JVC Entertainment has released a total of four DVD volumes in Japan, with the first being released on December 24, 2008. The fifth volume is scheduled to be released on April 22, 2009. Each volume contains one disc, with each one containing three episodes, save the first volume, which contains only the first episode. Every volume also contains extras, ranging from Drama CDs to original illustrations by the creator.
Music.
Five pieces of theme music are used for the anime series; one opening theme, two ending themes and two insert songs. The opening theme is by the Japanese band Ali Project, the ending themes are and "Remedy" by Maaya Sakamoto, and the insert songs are and "PROUD" by Lisa Komine. An orchestra version of "Kitei no Tsurugi" was also used as an insert song in episode 20. Ali Project released the "Kitei no Tsurugi" single on November 19, 2008, while "Ame ga Furu", Maaya's seventeenth single, was released on October 29, 2008. The second ending theme, "Remedy" was released within Maaya's sixth album, Kazeyomi, on January 14, 2009.
Reception.
While the manga has garnered attention from noted animators and manga artists like Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and Mamoru Nagano, who are both avid readers of the series and recommends the work, early reviews of the anime adaptation have been generally mixed. Four different reviewers from the anime and manga social networking site Anime News Network gave negative reviews based on the first few episodes; agreeing that the storyline is generic and predictable, and that it contains an easily detestable main character (Kouichi). Though the mecha designs were likable, the anime's characters designs and computer generated graphics were scrutinized and described as not being one of Gonzo's best. Despite one of the reviewers finding the anime "marginally more tolerable" by the second episode, she comments that, "Whether or not you will be horrified enough to stop watching this show will be determined by your own personal level of tolerance for Kouichi's hubris." Dani Moure of Mania, an entertainment website, believes that the first episode "does a good job of introducing the premise of the show," but finds it "predictable and full of several clichés." Also, though Moure comments that Kouichi is a dislikable character, he states that "he grows into his role with his belief that there is more to come from him." In Moure's reviews of further episodes, he comments on how the series remains entertaining, "developing into a solid show," and that "watching Kouichi struggle to cope with the power that's been presented to him is becoming interesting."

History.
In mediaeval time Crnča was important mining and trade center of Serbian state during the 14th and 15th century. The mine and market at Lipnik located in present day Crnča were first time recorded in Ragusan archieves in 1319. as the place belonging to Serbian king Milutin. Lipnik was also mentioned as the place in Serbia with catholic parish in letter of pope Clement VI to king Stefan Dušan dated in 7 January 1346. By its present name Crnča was first time recorded in Ragusan archieves in 1367 (variously spelled in Italian and Latin as Cernca, Cernica, Crniza, Zrnza, Zerniza, etc.) as a place with flourishing Ragusan trade and mining colony. In that time Crnča was famous for its silver mines founded by German miners called " Saxons " which were also attested in settlement in 1375 when Ragusan trader Bogavac Pribojevic bought parts of silver mines from some Germans (..."de alguni Todeschi"). Crnča was seat of major Ragusan colony which had its own Franciscan monastery of S.Maria and was headed by elected " knez"/"comes/conte" i.e. count, one of them being Ljubisa Vladojevic called " Brada " ( " The Beard " ). Most notable Ragusans who traded and lived in Crnča belonged to noble families belonging to House of Gučetić, Sorkočević, House of Crijević, Gundulić, House of Lukarić and Ranjina. Crnča was also seat of diverse crafts with numbers of tailors, goldsmiths, furriers and candle makers mentioned in Ragusan sources. Crnča reached its peak in second half of 15th century during the time of despots Stefan Lazarević and Đurađ Branković when it was one of the richest mines of Serbia along with Novo Brdo, Srebrenica and Rudnik. In 1459 Crnča fell under Ottoman rule with rest of the Serbia and started to decline as mining and trade center with Ragusan colony disappearing by 1471. By the 1519 Crnča is no longer mentioned as a mine although Ottomans brought new law for mine of Crnča in 1488. In later periods Crnča and surrounding areas became part of Ottoman" has" (sultan's estate) of Bukovica.

Lucky Peak Dam

Lucky Peak Dam is a rolled earth and gravel fill embankment dam in the United States, located on the Boise River in Ada County, Idaho. It is directly downstream of Arrowrock Dam, a concrete arch dam completed in 1915. This dam was designed by Mary Smith (a local architect). At the time of its construction in the early 1950s, Lucky Peak's primary purpose was flood control, with a secondary purpose of irrigation. The normal operating elevation of the full reservoir is above sea level, the empty reservoir's elevation (Boise River) is .
Construction began in November 1949 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the dam was operational in 1955 and its resulting reservoir is Lucky Peak Lake. Most of the federal dams in southern Idaho, including the others on the Boise River, were built by the Bureau of Reclamation, not the Corps of Engineers. The Idaho Power Company, a private utility, built multiple hydroelectric dams on the Snake River. 
It is located along State Highway 21, upstream from the city of Boise. Originally built without hydroelectric power generation, the construction of the Lucky Peak powerhouse was begun in 1984 and became operational in 1988, generating electricity primarily for Seattle City Light.
The dam was named after a nearby mountain in the Boise Range; the summit of Lucky Peak mountain reaches to an elevation of , about four miles (6 km) north of the dam.
The dam forms Lucky Peak Lake and is surrounded by Lucky Peak State Park.

Bethany Veney

Bethany Johnson Veney (ca. 1813 – 16 November 1916) is best remembered in historical studies for her autobiography, "Aunt Betty’s Story: The Narrative of Bethany Veney, A Slave Woman" (1889).
Significance of "Aunt Betty's Story".
The value of Veney's narrative is apparent. While "Weevils in the Wheat: Interviews with Virginia Ex-Slaves" (1976) and the Works Progress Administration Records Group, Virginia Writers' Project files offer sketch-like recollections of slaves in Virginia, according to "Weevils"' annotated bibliography of slave narratives, there are only 29 published narratives that cover the subject of slavery in Virginia between 1784 and 1865. Of that number, there are only three that deal with slavery in the Shenandoah Valley – two being from former Frederick County, Virginia slaves, and one (Bethany Veney) from Page County, Virginia. A review of the Web reveals that over 30 active sites offer links to one of three or four sites that offer the complete text of Bethany Veney's narrative. Additionally, a handful of university related sites hail Veney's narrative as essential reading when it comes to the history of slavery in the United States.
An overview of the personalities in "Aunt Betty's Story".
In addition to detailing her early life and experiences, Aunt Betty's Story mentions a number of personalities from early 19th-century Page County, Virginia. All of the families mentioned lived near Luray, Virginia (the 49th District in 1850), and were simple farmers.
While Bethany's last and second to last owners (John Printz, Sr. – born 1807; David McKay – born 1806) are mentioned in the narrative, a review of the county records leaves some uncertainties as to whether Bethany's first owner was truly James Fletcher of Pass Run. Taken into consideration as property and inventoried, Bethany and her sister Matilda were passed on to Lucy (a "spinster" and daughter of James) Fletcher (born ca. 1801) as a "share." Bethany's grandmother and "Uncle Peter" were given to Nasenath (also a daughter of James) Fletcher. Bethany recalled that Nasenath later married David Kibler (born ca. 1803 and a farmer with $2,500 in real estate in 1850), with whom they all found a "home" shortly thereafter. However, the 1850 census records and county marriage records indicate that Kibler's spouse (as of August 1837) was Mary Ann Leavill (born ca. 1816), leaving a question about whether Bethany's mother's owner was a Fletcher or Leavill. David, the son of Martin and Dorothy/"Polly" Kibler, died in 1873 of apoplexy.
While not an owner of Bethany Veney, another key character in the narrative was Jonas Mannyfield (Menefee), the owner of "Jerry," to whom Bethany was first married.
"Aunt Betty's" childhood.
Bethany Johnson (later Veney, because of her second marriage to Frank Veney) was born ca. 1813 in Shenandoah County, Virginia (the portion that later became Page County, Virginia), the daughter of slaves Joseph and Charlotte Johnson. Writing of her early life, Bethany begins her narrative simply: "My mother and her five children were owned by one James Fletcher, Pass Run, town of Luray, Page County, Virginia. Of my father I know nothing."
Her mother and master both died when she was around nine years old. Veney and her family were split up, Bethany ending up with her mistress, "Miss Lucy" (Lucy Fletcher) and David Kibbler (Kibler) – whom Vethany refers to as a "Dutchman" with a violent temper. Miss Lucy hated slavery but did not know what to do about the way things were, except to be kind to Bethany.
Religious experiences.
After some time with Lucy Fletcher and David Kibler, Bethany made her first visit to a church. Though Master Kibler's brother became a Christian and started a meeting for people in the area, Kibler did not want Veney attending church, and sent her away to allow her new-found religious fervor to abate. He sent her to a man named Mr. Levers (Leavill), but Leavill allowed Veney to attend church. In a telling passage, she describes a scene in which Kibbler escorts her from the church.
Every night, old Mr. Levers would tell me I could go; and I did, till, in the middle of the meeting one night, Master Kibbler came up to me, and, taking me by the arm, carried me out, scolding and fuming, declaring that old Webster (the minister) was a liar, and that for himself he didn't want such a "whoopin' and hollerin' religion," and, if that was the way to heaven, he didn't "want to go there." 
Veney eventually outlasted Kibler, and he allowed her to go to church regularly and she was baptized.
First marriage.
Bethany first married Jerry Fickland after their masters consented to the union and told them to simply be together. Bethany, however, wanted to be legally married and the couple eventually found someone to marry them. Bethany wrote of how the couple, however, was unable to make traditional vows – like white people – because their circumstances as slaves could result in distancing the couple at the will of the owners.
A few months into their marriage, Jerry was arrested. He escaped and ran away but couldn't evade capture. His escape, attempts to avoid detection and subsequent capture seemed to have broken Jerry. He was sent away and Bethany and Jerry never saw each other again.
Motherhood.
While still at David Kibler's, Bethany became a mother with her first child, Charlotte, and immediately began to worry about being separated from her. She writes:
My dear white lady, in your pleasant home made joyous by the tender love of husband and children all your own, you can never understand the slave mother's emotions as she clasps her new-born child, and knows that a master's word can at any moment take it from her embrace; and when, as was mine, that child is a girl, and from her own experience she sees its almost certain doom is to minister to the unbridled lust of the slave-owner, and feels that the law holds over her no protecting arm, it is not strange that, rude and uncultured as I was, I felt all this, and would have been glad if we could have died together there and then.
She tried to find a new location away from Master Kibler. She explored her options through Miss Lucy and found someone to buy her – a local man named John Prince (Printz).
Second marriage and freedom.
During her time under the ownership of John Printz (into the 1850s), Bethany met and married Frank Veney. Though only Bethany's second marriage, according to Frank Veney, this was his seventh marriage. It was also during this time that Bethany was sold to David McKay and employed, with McKay's permission, by George James Adams. Though in the area on business in copper-mining operations, Adams was also an activist in the anti-slavery movement in Rhode Island. He eventually purchased Bethany and her second child, Joe Veney, and sent them to his home in Providence, Rhode Island. This also resulted in the permanent separation with Frank Veney.
Though Bethany could finally enjoy freedom, it was also during her stay in Providence that her son, Joe, died.
After "Aunt Betty's Story".
Though "Aunt Betty's Story" ends, she lived another another 26 years beyond the conclusion of the autobiography.
At the opening of the Civil War, G.J. Adams told Bethany that “she was at liberty to go wherever she pleased.” Veney then went to Worcester, Massachusetts, and one of the first things she recalled doing was making gruel and carrying it to the sick Union soldiers in Brookfield. During this time, she also worked as a laundress and earned extra money by going door to door and selling a bluing solution (made to brighten clothing). She apparently had a thriving business in selling this solution to housewives of her neighborhood and “if one of her customers moved to another part of Worcester it was her custom to carry the bluing to them.”
After the Civil War, Aunt Betty returned to Virginia several times and brought 16 relatives to Worcester with her, including her daughter Charlotte, who had married Aaron Jackson since Bethany's departure from Page County.
At 1 p.m. on November 16, 1916, Bethany Veney, at the age of 103 years, died at the home of her daughter, Charlotte, at 33 Winfield Street in Worcester. It was said that she “retained her faculties, except her eyesight, in a wonderful manner. Her memory was keen, not in the manner of old persons, in remembering dates of long ago, but she kept herself posted on the topics of interest of today and although she could not read because of her eyesight in later years, she kept posted by asking questions.”
Bethany’s daughter, Charlotte, died on February 14, 1921, at a home that she had moved to since the death of her mother, at 89 Mayfield Street in Worcester. She was buried in Mt. Hope Cemetery near her mother.
On July 12, 2003, the Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, signed a proclamation honoring Bethany Veney and her life by declaring the day “Bethany Veney Day in Worcester, Massachusetts.”

Dorothy Eady

Dorothy Louise Eady, also known as Omm Sety or Om Seti (16 January 1904 – 21 April 1981), was Keeper of the Abydos Temple of Seti I and draughtswoman for the Department of Egyptian Antiquities. She is especially well known for her belief that in a previous life she had been a priestess in Ancient Egypt, as well as her considerable historical research at Abydos. Her life and work has been the subject of many articles, television documentaries, biographies. A "New York Times" article described her life story as "one of the Western World's most intriguing and convincing modern case histories of reincarnation"
Early life.
Dorothy Louise Eady was born in London in 1904, and raised in a coastal town. At the age of three, after falling down a flight of stairs, she began exhibiting strange behaviours, asking that she be "brought home". This caused some conflict in her early life. Her Sunday school teacher requested that her parents keep her away from class, because she had compared Christianity with "heathen" Ancient Egyptian. She was expelled from a Dulwich girls school after she refused to sing a hymn that called on God to "curse the swart Egyptians". Her regular visits to Catholic mass, which she liked because it reminded her of the "Old Religion", were terminated after an interrogation and visit to her parents by a priest.
After being taken by her parents to visit the British Museum, and on observing a photograph in the New Kingdom temple exhibits room, the young Eady called out "There is my home!" but "where are the trees? Where are the gardens?" The temple was that of Seti I, the father of Rameses the Great. She ran about the halls of the Egyptian rooms, "amongst her peoples", kissing the statues' feet. After this trip she took every opportunity to visit the British Museum rooms. There, she eventually met E. A. Wallis Budge, who was taken by her youthful enthusiasm and encouraged her in the study of hieroglyphs.
After a close escape during a bombing raid during World War I, she moved to her grandmother's house in Sussex. Here, she continued her study of Ancient Egypt at the Eastbourne public library. When she was fifteen she described a nocturnal visit from the mummy of Pharaoh Seti I. Her behaviour, coupled with sleep walking and nightmares, led her to be incarcerated in sanatoriums several times. On leaving school at sixteen she visited museums and archaeological sites around Britain, facilitated by her father's investigations into the nationwide booming cinema industry.
Eady became a part-time student at Plymouth Art School and began to collect affordable Egyptian antiquities. During her period at Portsmouth she became part of theatre group that on occasion performed a play based on the story of Isis and Osiris. She took the role of Isis and sung the lamentation for Osiris's death, based on Andrew Lang's translation:
At the age of twenty-seven, she began working in London with an Egyptian public relations magazine, for which she wrote articles and drew cartoons that reflected her political support for an independent Egypt. It was during this period she met her future husband Eman Abdel Meguid, an Egyptian student, with whom she continued to correspond when he returned home.
Move to Egypt.
In 1931 she moved to Egypt after Emam Abdel Meguid, by now a teacher of English, asked her to marry him. On arriving in Egypt, she kissed the ground and announced she had come home to stay. The couple stayed in Cairo and her husband's family gave her the nickname "Bulbul" (Nightingale). Their son was named Sety, from which is derived her popular name 'Omm Sety' ("Mother of Sety"). 
After a chance meeting with George Reisner's secretary, who commented on her apparent ability to charm snakes and told her that spells on such powers were in early Ancient Egyptian literature, Omm Sety visited the Fifth Dynasty pyramid of Unas. Klaus Baer recalled her piety when she accompanied him on a visit to Sakkara in the early 1950s, when she brought an offering and took off her shoes before entering Unas' pyramid. She continued to report apparitions and out-of-body experiences during this time, which caused friction with the upper-middle-class family she had married into.
Hor-Ra's story of her life.
During her early period she reported night time visitations by an apparition of Hor-Ra. He slowly dictated to her, over a twelve-month period, the story of her previous life. The story took up around seventy pages of cursive hieroglyphic text. It described the life of a young woman in Ancient Egypt, called Bentreshyt, who had reincarnated in the person of Dorothy Eady. Bentreshyt ("Harp of Joy") is described in this text as being of humble origin, her mother a vegetable seller and her father a soldier during the reign of Seti I (c.1290 BC to 1279 BC). When she was three, her mother died, and she was placed in the temple of Kom el-Sultan because her father couldn't afford her. There, she was brought up to be a priestess. When she was twelve years old the High Priest asked her if she wished to go out into the world or stay and become a consecrated virgin. In the absence of full understanding and without a practical alternative, she took the vows.
During the next two years, she learned her role in the annual drama of Osiris's passion and resurrection, a role that only virgin priestesses consecrated to Isis could perform. One day Seti I visited and spoke to her. They became lovers, eating "the uncooked goose", an Ancient Egyptian term that has been compared to "eating the forbidden fruit." When Bentreshyt became pregnant she told the High Priest who the father was. The High Priest informed her that the gravity of the offence against Isis was so terrible that death would be the most likely penalty at a trial. Unwilling to face the public scandal for Seti, she committed suicide rather than face trial.
Work with Selim Hassan and Ahmed Fakhry.
In 1935, Dorothy Eady separated from her husband when he took a teaching job in Iraq. Their son Sety stayed with her. Two years after the marriage broke down she went to live in Nazlat al-Samman near the Giza pyramids, where she met the Egyptian archaeologist Selim Hassan of the Department of Antiquities, who employed her as his secretary and draughtswoman. She was the department's first female employee and a boon to Hassan. According to Barbara Lesko, "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English-language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first-rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance."
Through her keen interest in antiquities, she met and befriended many of the famous Egyptologists of the era. Omm Seti made such a significant contribution to Hassan's work that upon his death she was employed by Ahmed Fakhry during his excavations at Dashur. Hassan's magnum opus, the ten-volume "Excavations at Giza", gives "special mention, with sincere gratitude," to Dorothy Eady for her editing, drawing, indexing, and proofreading work. She learned from these scholars the techniques of archaeology, whilst they benefited from her expertise in hieroglyphs and drawing.
During this time she prayed, made frequent offerings to the gods of Ancient Egypt, and would often spend the night in the Great pyramid. Eady became the object of village gossip because she would make night prayers and offerings to Horus at the Great Sphinx. Yet she also was respected by the villagers for her honesty in not hiding her true faith in the Egyptian gods. She was sensitive to the religious observances of others, and would fast with the Muslim villagers during Ramadan and celebrate with Christians at Christmas.
Her associations with the workers and their families gave her first-hand experience of contemporary Egyptian life. She saw a common thread joining all periods of Egyptian history; the Pharaonic, the Greco-Roman, the Christian, and the Islamic. This thread was the Nile, which animated peoples lives on many levels.
Move to Abydos.
Ahmed Fakhry's Dashur Pyramid Research Project was terminated in early 1956, leaving Dorothy Eady unemployed. Fakhry suggested that she "climb the Great Pyramid; and when you reach the top, just turn west, address yourself to your Lord Osiris and ask him "Quo vadis?". He offered her a choice of taking a well paid job in the Cairo Records Office, or a poorly paid position in Abydos as a draughtswoman. She chose the latter. She reported that Seti I approved of the move. He claimed that the "wheel of fate" was turning and this would be a time of testing. If she was chaste she would now undo Bentryshyt's ancient sin.
On the 3rd of March 1956, the fifty-two-year-old Omm Sety left for Abydos. She set up home in Arabet Abydos, which sits in the cradle of the mountain Pega-the-Gap. The Ancient Egyptians believed this mountain led to Amenti and the afterlife. It was here that she began to be called 'Omm Sety', because it was customary in Egyptian villages to refer to a mother by the name of her eldest child.
Abydos had an special significance for her, because it is where she believed Bentryshyt had lived and served in the Temple of Seti. She had made short pilgrimages to the site before, during which she had demonstrated her advanced knowledge. At one of these trips to the temple, the chief inspector from the Antiquities Department, who knew about her claims, had decided to test her by asking her to stand at particular wall paintings in complete darkness. She was instructed to identify them based on her prior knowledge as a temple priestess. She completed the task successfully, even though the painting locations had not yet been published at this time.
She spent the first two years listing and translating pieces from a recently excavated temple palace. Her work was incorporated into Edourard Ghazouli's monograph "The Palace and Magazines Attached to the Temple of Sety I at Abydos". He expressed particular thanks to her in this work and was impressed by the skills she showed in translation of enigmatic texts, along with other members of the Antiquities Department. In 1957, she wrote out a liturgical calendar of feast days based on Ancient Egyptian texts.
For her, the Temple of Seti was a place of peace and security where she was watched over by the benevolent eyes of Ancient Egyptian gods. Omm Sety claimed that in her past life as Bentreshyt the temple had a garden, where she had first met Seti I. Her descriptions as a young girl were not believed by her parents, but whilst living in Abydos the place she said it would be found. Excavations uncovered a garden which matched her descriptions.
Every morning and night she would visit the Temple to recite the prayers for the day. On the birthdays of Osiris and Isis she would observe the ancient food abstentions, and bring offerings of beer, wine, bread, and tea biscuits to the Chapel of Osiris. The Lament of Isis and Osiris, which she learned as a girl, would also be recited. She turned one of the temple rooms into a personal office, where she carried out her work and befriended a cobra whom she fed on a regular basis, to the alarm of the temple guards.
She described the Temple of Seti as like entering a time machine, where the past becomes the present and the modern mind has difficulty understanding a world in which magic is accepted. She claimed that the scenes depicted on the temple walls were active in the minds of ancient Egyptians on two levels. Firstly, they made the actions displayed permanent. The painting of Pharaoh offering bread to Osiris, for example, continued his actions so long as the depiction remained. Secondly, the image could be animated by the spirit of the god, if the person stood before the depiction and called on the god's name.
Omm Sety's observations of surviving folkways.
Omm Sety observed that, although modern village women could have free birth control, they didn't want it. "If they miss one year without having a child, they go running around all over the place – even to the doctor! And if that doesn't work, they will try all sorts of other things." These included approaching a temple image of Isis at Abydos ("the Good Lady"), Hathor at Dendera, a statue of Senwosret III south of Abydos, a statue of Taweret in the Cairo museum and the pyramids at Giza
She also reported how people would come to her looking for a cure for impotency. For these people she would carry out a ritual based on the Pyramid Texts. It always worked. The use of Heka without Maat was contrary to the "will of the gods", so she concentrated on healing people or ridding them of the "effects of evil spells". According to an acquaintance, "Omm Sety wouldn't do any harm to anybody unless he or she did harm to her."
She said that unusual baby feeding methods used in modern times in Egypt, such as breast milk being supplied via bowl, echoed similar scenes from Pharaonic times. The sidelock of youth which Ancient Egyptian children wore survived with some modern Egyptian peasant children, who were left with a tuft of hair after the rest is shaved off during their first hair cut. Ancient Egyptian boys were circumcised, probably for reasons of hygiene, and she believed this was picked up by the Jews, which in turn was passed down to modern Muslims. Many modern children's games and toys were also played by children in Ancient Egypt.
Omm Sety observed that the Tree of Extremity, mentioned in the Quran with inscribed leaves, compares with Ancient Egyptian Temple scenes in which a god is shown inscribing the royal cartouche on leaves adorning The Tree of Life.
Uniquely for a Muslim land, Omm Sety noted that modern Egyptian villages had a custom of highly visible form of mourning. She attributed this to Egypt's ancient heritage. Such customs were first recorded in the Pyramid Texts during the third millennium BCE. She compares other modern rituals of death with ancient practices, e.g. keeping watch with the dead (even though it is at variance with official Islamic teaching), perfuming the dead, boats in tombs, lights for the dead, the modern peasant practice of placing bread on the bier of the dead, and washing the cloths of the dead. Omm Sety observed that in Lower modern Egypt, "old fashioned people" believed that the stars in the night sky represented the dead, and notes how in the Pyramid Texts, the Royal deceased were also thought to be stars. The practice in Omm Seti's time of not cutting hair or shaving as a sign of mourning is also echoed in Ancient Egypt.
Though it doesn't form part of official Islamic teaching, she noted the widespread belief amongst modern Egyptians, educated and uneducated, that each human had a qarina, a spiritual component which is separate from the soul, and she compared this with the Ancient Egyptian belief in a person's Ka Ancient Egyptians believed that the shadow of a person was an intrinsic part of human make-up, and Omm Sety noted that the peasants of modern Egypt held similar beliefs and treated the shadow with caution.
She compares the modern Egyptian belief in Afrits (demonic beings who appear upside-down) with the demonic upside-down beings who appear in the Pyramid Texts. Ancient Egyptians believed in Heka, "magic," and used protective amulets with spells written on them. She compares this with modern practices, performed by poor sellers in market squares, in which verses of the Koran are inscribed on, or tucked into, amulets. Coptic priests also practice similar methods.
Both Ancient and modern Egyptians commonly believed in spiritual possession and practised techniques for freeing the victim. Examples survive from ancient times showing how a statue of a god, propitiated with offerings, brought the release of possessed person. In modern times the person who presides over such a ritual is called a shaykh and, similar to ancient practices, offerings are made to the spirit which has taken up residence in the person. An alternative way is a ceremony called the butadjiyya, in which words are recited from the Quaran with the patient immersed in the smoke of incense. A Christian method involves a pilgrimage to a Coptic Church at Mit Damsis. After ten days without washing it is hoped that St. George will appear and pierce the patient's foot from which the demon will depart.
Omm Sety believed in the curative powers of water from certain holy places. She would heal herself by jumping into the sacred pool in the Osireion fully clothed. Friends report how she not only healed herself but others using this method. A baby brought to her by distraught parents because of breathing difficulties recovered after using water from the Osireion. Omm Sety reported that she no longer needed glasses, was cured of arthritis and appendicitis using the waters of the Osireion.
Along with Kent Weeks she was interested, and very knowledgeable, on the subject of folk medicine. He notes that treatments used today can be traced back through Ancient Egyptian texts which associate the particular trees used with goddesses such as Hathor and Isis. Omm Seti recorded that long after the conversion of Egypt to Islam, the power of the "old gods" was still recognised. Al-Maqrizi recorded that that ever since a fanatical shaykh disfigured the face of the Sphinx the cultivated land around Giza had been invaded and covered with sand. Unlike the gods associated with fertility, she noted the fear inspired in some modern Egyptians by a statue of the goddess Sekhmet even though they were unaware of the Ancient Egyptian accounts associating her with the destruction of mankind.
A common belief amongst village people relates to a "bogeyman" and "terrorist", called Ba Bah, and compares with the obscure Ancient Egyptian god Bwbi who similarly invoked terror. Villagers from the town of Arabet Abydos reported occasionally seeing a "large golden boat" floating upon a one-time lake. Omm Sety noted that the villagers were ignorant of the Ancient Egyptian mystery play, once enacted at Abydos, involving a Neshmet boat. The villagers, obliviously, observed the apparition where there had once been a sacred lake.
Popular customs associated with Easter, observed by both Copts and Muslims, were considered by her to probably originate in Ancient Egypt. On "Job Wednesday," during the week preceding Easter Sunday, a bath is taken and the body scrubbed with a plant called ghabira by the Muslims and damissa by the Copts. They believe that Job of the Bible was cured from his leprosy by similar means. In the absence of any scriptural authority for this event, she speculates that it is based on the Pyramid texts in which the same plant is used by the King to purify himself.
Between December and January (the month of Koiak in both Ancient Egyptian and Coptic calendar's), Muslims and Copts, but mainly the latter, sow small gardens which are thought to bring prosperity to the household when they sprout. Omm Sety believed that this originates with the Ancient Egyptian practice of sowing "Osiris Gardens" and "Osiris Beds" during the month of Kiahk. The sprouting vegetation symbolised resurrection. Andrew Strum notes a similar practice amongst Egyptian Jews, in this case relating to atonement for sin, and also speculates that this has its origins in the Osirian beliefs of Ancient Egypt.
Omm Sety detailed many other modern practices transmitted down from ancient times in short articles written between 1969 and 1975. These were edited and published by the Egyptologist Nicole B. Hansen in 2008, under the title "Omm Sety's Living Egypt: Surviving Folkways from Pharaonic Times," with a foreword by Kent Weeks and an introduction by Walter A. Fairservis.
Later years.
On reaching the age of sixty in 1964, Omm Sety was faced with mandatory retirement by the Antiquities Department and advised to seek part-time work in Cairo. She went to Cairo, but only stayed one day before returning to Abydos. The Antiquities Department decided to make an exception to their retirement age rules and allowed her to continue her work at Abydos for a further five years, until she retired in 1969. Her 30$ a month pension was supplemented by needlework sold to friends and tourists, who also brought gifts of clothes, food, and reading materials.
She began work as part-time consultant for the Antiquities Department, guiding tourists around the Temple of Seti and explaining the symbolism of the painted wall scenes. In 1972, she suffered a mild heart attack and in the aftermath decided to sell her old house and move into a zareba (a ramshackle single room made of reeds). Ahmed Soliman, the son of the onetime keeper of the Temple of Seti, built a simple mudbrick house adjacent to his family home where Omm Sety moved and lived as part of the Soliman family. She reported in her diary that on first moving into her new home, Seti I appeared and carried out a ritual that consecrated the habitation, bowing reverently towards small statues of Osiris and Isis she kept in a small shrine-niche.
During this visit Seti described the one and only time he saw the god Set, his namesake. As a prelude to meeting Set he fasted for ten days before entering the Chapel of the Great Strength, where the god appeared with "a beauty that cannot be described". On sensing that he was the spirit of all that was cruel and evil, Seti fled to the sound of mocking laughter from the god, never to serve Set again. He counselled that "one should not serve an evil being, even if it appears to have a good or useful attribute or function." Seti made several visits during the following weeks, during which he gave his opinion of the Greek story of Atlantis (a Cretan had once told him that the islands of the Aegean were the tops of mountains from a great land that had sunk into the Mediterranean) and the origins of Osiris ("our Lord came from Amenti, whence he returned").
Associations with Egyptologists.
Omm Seti got to know all the leading Egyptologists of her day during her stay in Abydos. Lanny Bell and William Murnane from Chicago House recalled going "up to Abydos to see Omm Sety, have tea in her place" and then viewing the temples with her. John Romer recalled taking a bottle of vodka to her home and Omm Sety having fun telling the slightly more ribald stories of the gods and goddesses.
She spoke of Rameses II, the son of Seti I, whom she always saw as a teenager, as when Bentreshyt first knew him. She regarded him, in common with other Egyptologists, as "the most slandered of all the pharaohs" because of biblically derived accounts describing him as the Pharaoh of the Oppression and the slaughterer of baby boys, traits which are contradicted by contemporary records. Kenneth Kitchen, an expert on this period, considered her "a true Ramesside". He said that there was "a certain truth in her familial approach" and that she "came to all sorts of perfectly sensible conclusions about the actual, objective material of the Sety Temple."
Nicholas Kendall of the National Film Board of Canada visited Egypt in 1979 to make a documentary, "The Lost Pharaoh: The Search for Akhenaten". Donald Redford, who had led a team that recently unearthed material relating to the reign of Akhenaten, asked Omm Sety to appear in the film. She, in common with other Egytologists, didn't regard the king as a romantic idealist dedicated to a universal god, but a "one-track minded, authoritarian iconoclast who impaled captives and deported populations."
In October 1980, Julia Cave and a team from the BBC arrived in Abydos to film the documentary "Omm Sety and Her Egypt". Featuring interviews with Egyptologists T. G. H. James and Rosalie David, it described Abydos and the excavations that had been undertaken. It had extensive input from Omm Sety, who used crutches due to her deteriorating health. The documentary was broadcast on BBC 2 in May 1981. "The Times" wrote of the documentary "An incredulous smile froze on lips as I watched the Chronicle film Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Could I be absolutely positive it was all a lot of eyewash? Of course I couldn't. And neither will you be able to. In any case, it makes marvellous television." At the time the BBC were recording their documentary, the American producer Miriam Birch asked Omm Sety to appear, along with Egyptologists Kent Weeks and Lanny Bell, in a documentary that National Geographic Channel was filming, "Egypt: Quest for Eternity". It concentrated on Rameses II, the son of Seti I. Shooting took place in March 1981, coinciding with Omm Sety's seventy-seventh birthday party at Chicago House, which was filmed. She was in a lot of pain but full of good cheer, and the film crew carried her up to the Temple of Seti for filming. This was to be her last visit to the shrine in which she believed she had served in as a priestess 3,000 years before.
Omm Seti had once said "Death holds no terror for me..I'll just do my best to get through the Judgment. I'm going to come before Osiris, who will probably give me a few dirty looks because I know I've committed some things I shouldn't have." Because the Muslims and Christians wouldn't let "a heathen" be buried in their graveyards, Omm Sety built her own underground tomb decorated with a false door. Through this door the Ka was believed to travel between this world and the next, and it was engraved with an offering prayer in conformance with ancient beliefs. The staff of Chicago House gave her an imitation Shawabti figurine to place in the tomb. On April 10, 1981 she gave away her two cats as her condition deteriorated. On the 15th April she received a letter from Olivia Robertson confirming that Omm Sety had been enrolled in the Fellowship of Isis, an interfaith spiritual movement focused on the goddess, on the 23rd March. On April 21, 1981 Omm Sety died in Abydos. The local health authority refused to allow her to be buried in the tomb she had constructed, so she was interred in an unmarked grave, facing the west, in the desert outside a Coptic cemetery.
Possible sites for archaeological exploration.
In the early 1970s, shortly after Nasser's death, Omm Sety disclosed that she believed the location of Nefertiti's tomb was known to her but showed some reluctance in disclosing its "most unlikely place" because Seti I didn't like Akhenaten for his attempt to suppress traditional Egyptian religious practices. "We don't want anything more of this family to be known." She described the location of the tomb as being close to Tutankhamun's, which was counter to the then prevailing opinion that no more new tombs would be found in the Valley of the Kings. In 1998 the ARPT group led by Nicholas Reeves began exploring in the area of Tutankhamun's tomb, based on two anomalies found during a sonar sounding in 1976. During the dig two undisturbed seals of the 20th dynasty scribe Wen-nefer, a well known person whose seal has been found on many Valley tombs, were discovered. A radar scan in 2000 produced evidence of two empty chambers, but the work was halted pending an investigation into the theft of antiquities. In 2006 Otto Shaden, on a completely unrelated dig, accidentally burst into one of the "anomalies" (later numbered KV63), which contained particularly fine examples of mummification supplies used for a royal burial, presumably nearby. Reeves' opinion is that the second "anomaly" is likely to be an undisturbed tomb.
Whilst the general public tend to focus on the beauty of Ancient Egyptian artefacts, scholars highly value texts which reveal more about history and religious beliefs. Since Edgar Cayce, a clairvoyant of Presbyterian background, asserted whilst in a trance state that a Hall of Records was to be found in the area of the Sphinx, there have been repeated attempts to find its supposed location In 1973 Omm Sety recalled asking Seti I about these Halls of Records. He replied that every temple had a book repository ("Per-Medjat"), but that the one attached to the Temple of Amun-Ra in Luxor contained all the important documents "from the time of the Ancestors," including those that survived the political upheaval at the end of the 6th dynasty. In 1952 Omm Sety translated for Abdul Kader inscriptions from Ram statues he had uncovered from the temple at Luxor. They had been found in the area where Seti located the Hall of Records. Contrary to normal practice for this type of statue, there was no writing on the back, suggesting that they had once been placed against an otherwise unknown wall or building. Based on Seti's description and the location of the Rams, both she and Dr. Zeini believed that the Hall of Records is likely to be located under the modern building which houses the Arab Socialist League.
Opinions of Egyptologists.
According to the late John A. Wilson, head of the Oriental Institute, and called the "dean of American Egyptology" by contemporaries, Omm Sety deserved to be treated as "a responsible scholar". She was a source for modern scholarship seeking to understand how traditional ancient religious practices have survived into modern times, as "folk customs" practiced by modern Egyptians Copts and Muslims. Unlike people who claimed to be reincarnated figures from Ancient Egypt, she was treated with respect by Egyptologists, and whilst none publicly subscribed to the phenomena she reported, none doubted her sincerity and many have used her observations of past and present Egypt as reliable source material.
Kent Weeks wrote that scholars have "never doubted the accuracy of Omm Sety's field observations. As an ethnographer, a participant-observer of modern Egyptian village life, Omm Sety has had few equals. Her studies easily hold their own next to the works of Lane, Blackman, Henein, and others who have examined Egypt's long and fascinating cultural traditions."
Egyptologists who knew Omm Sety were impressed by her knowledge of Ancient Egypt. Klaus Baer of the Oriental Institute commented that "she had visions and worshipped the Ancient Egyptian gods. But she understood the methods and standards of scholarship which is usually not the case with nuts," nor did she "desire to convert anyone." Omm Sety was impressed by Hermann Junker, "one of the elders of 20th century archaeology," who had taught Selim Hassan. He advocated a more honest approach to the study of Ancient Egyptian religion, believing that "nobody had made a real effort to go deeply enough into it." She admired his open-mindedness, especially since Junker was also a Catholic priest. One noted Egyptologist, who didn't wish to be named, commented "I was deeply shocked when, one night, I attended a party given by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry behind the Great Pyramid..and there under the full moon was Dorothy Eady belly dancing! I couldn't believe my eyes!" William Murnane of the Oriental Institute recalled "It was always a pleasure to be with her and listen to whatever she said..you really couldn't take her anything but seriously."
Kenneth Kitchen, author of the seven-volume "Ramesside Inscriptions," described Omm Sety as a "true Ramesside" who "came to all sorts of conclusions about the actual objective material of the Sety Temple – which may have also coincided with things that she felt she knew some other way..and that paid dividends. Donald Redford invited Omm Sety to appear in the documentary "The Lost Pharaoh," in which she gives her description of Akhenaton, including a negative view of the religious revolution he attempted (comparing him to the Ayatollah Khomeini - "a fanatic"), a viewpoint broadly shared by scholars such Seton-Williams and Redford.
John. A. Wilson of the Oriental Institute of Chicago praised her book "Abydos, Holy city of Ancient Egypt" for its "comprehensive coverage of every ancient element in Abydos" and described Omm Sety as "a responsible scholar". During a visit to the Great Pyramid by a Japanese team with sophisticated sensing equipment, one English Egyptologist, with nods of approval from others, said "If Omm Sety were still here I'd take her word for where things can be found, any day, over the most-state-of-the-art equipment out there." William Simpson, Professor of Egyptology at Yale, considered Omm Sety to be a "delightful person" and thought that "a great many people in Egypt took advantage of her because she more or less traded her knowledge of ancient Egypt by writing or helping people out by doing drafting for them for a pittance." Dr. Labib Habachi, one of "two leading Egyptian archaeologists of his day" and a great admirer of Dorothy Eady's work, claimed that she was a ghost writer.
James P. Allen commented "Sometimes you weren't sure whether Omm Sety wasn't pulling your leg. Not that she was a phoney in what she said or believed - she was absolutely not a con artist - but she knew that some people looked on her as a crackpot, so she kind of fed into that notion and let you go either way with it..She believed enough to make it spooky, and it made you doubt your own sense of reality sometimes." Barbara Lesko wrote, "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance."William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." When "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that "she had something"."
Other opinions.
Carl Sagan considered Omm Sety as "a lively, intelligent, dedicated woman who made real contributions to Egyptology. This is true whether her belief in reincarnation is fact or fantasy." He viewed such phenomena as being rooted in fear of death and that humankind has commonly sought reassurance in some form of afterlife. He pointed out that there was no independent record, other than her own accounts, to verify what she claimed. In his opinion, whilst "functioning soundly and constructively in most aspects of her adult life" she "nevertheless carried strong childhood, adolescent fantasies" into adulthood. A psychiatrist who specialized in adolescent behaviour speculated that Dorothy Eady's fall down stairs as a child may have resulted in damage to the locus ceruleus, which could have resulted in a dislocation from her surroundings resulting in the embracement of an obsession. The psychologist Michael Gruber noted that Omm Sety lived "a functional life in so-called everyday reality", including work in Egyptology, embroidery, making jewellery and socializing with people. Her reported experiences enriched her life so much that "it would be an extreme loss to have seen her simply as someone who was hallucinating"

New South Wales D58 class locomotive

The D58 class was a class of steam locomotives built by the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia. They were built with the 4-8-2 wheel arrangement.
Construction.
In 1943 approval was given for the New South Wales Government Railways Workshops to build 25 freight locomotives. The design was a modified version of the 57 class. The main alterations were the use of a rack and pinion valve gear in lieu of the Gresley 2:1 conjugated vale gear for the middle cylinder and the use of smaller cylinders to enable the locomotives to run to on the Main North line to Broadmeadow, a route which had a tighter loading gauge. They also used a Woodard divided drive of twin coupling rods between the second and third driving wheels. A valance was fitted over the valve gear on the front platform.
Eveleigh Railway Workshops built 11 locomotives and Cardiff Locomotive Workshops two. The first entered service in March 1950. The decision to move to diesel power saw only 13 locomotives completed.
Operations.
Whilst the derived rack and pinion valve gear appeared superior in theory, in practice it required more maintenance and lubrication. The smaller diameter cylinders demanded a later cut-off and used more steam, thus making the locomotives uneconomical in the use of coal and water when compared with the 57 class. Despite the design being made to enable use on the Main Northern line from Sydney to Broadmeadow, few journeys were ever made on this route. They mainly were used on the Main Western line to Lithgow and in a limited capacity on the Main South line to Junee.
After a very short service life, the entire class had been withdrawn by July 1957 and were all cut up by March 1964. Some parts were recovered and used on 57 class locomotives. There are no surviving examples, however the tender of 5808 lies near Canberra station. Some 58 class tenders saw further use as water tankers around New South Wales. One is at the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum.

Gemstone industry in Greenland

Gemstones have been found in Greenland, including diamond, ruby, sapphire, kornerupine, tugtupite, lapis lazuli, amazonite, peridot, quartz, spinel, topaz, and tourmaline. Most of Greenland's ruby and sapphire occurrences are located near the village of Fiskenaesset/Qeqertarsuatsiaat on the southwest coast.
A total of 31 ruby and sapphire occurrences have been confirmed in the Fiskenaesset/Qeqertarsuatsiaat district. One of these occurrences, Aappaluttoq, is being developed for a potential mining operation.
When European scientists first arrived in Greenland over 200 years ago to study the geology, they encountered native Kalaallit (Greenlandic Inuit) people who were already familiar with the red gemstone ruby.
The native inhabitants continued to assist the European explorers with their ruby exploration, leading them to some half dozen locations, spread out for over a hundred miles along the southwest shores of Greenland, known as the Kitaa Coast.
Gemmology.
Ruby and pink sapphire are the red and pink varieties of the mineral corundum, an aluminum-oxide mineral Al2O3. The pink/red colour is formed in corundum by adding the element chromium to its crystal structure. Spectroscopy of rubies from the Aappaluttoq occurrence in Greenland confirm the presence of chromium as well as showing absorption in the UV region indicating high Fe (iron) content.
Characteristics reported in Thirangoon, 2009, include:
Geology.
The ruby deposits of Fiskenæsset are Archaen aged and are contact metasomatic replacements in micaceous anorthosites. Corundum forms locally in both regional and contact metamorphic environments, as well as in hydrothermal settings. Ruby-bearing metasomatic zones typically formed along the amphibolite hangingwall contact of the chromite bearing and cumulate-layered Fiskenæsset anorthosite complex in close proximity to altered ultramafic rocks. Individually, ruby-bearing zones can measure up to 20 metres in thickness and up to 200 metres in length. They may occur as single showings, but are usually found in alignments of multiple showings, with some of the occurrences such as The Ruby Island Line collectively up to 3.5 kilometres in strike length, and as much as 100 metres in width.
History.
In 1966, gem-quality ruby was discovered in outcrop on what became known as Ruby Island by Dr. Martin Ghisler, with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). Ghisler’s scouts and support staff drew heavily from the knowledge of the native population of the nearby village of Qeqertarsuatsiaat (formerly Fiskenaesset). The exploration team discovered ruby in association with the minerals sapphirine, kornerupine, pargasite, and phlogopite, confirming six ruby deposits in the Fiskenaesset district.
During the 1970s, junior Canadian mining companies, among them Platinomino, Fiscannex, and Valhalla, explored the region for chromite and platinum and attempted, unsuccessfully, to commercialize the ruby occurrences near Fiskenaesset.
Peter Appel (1995) with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, published a review of the six ruby deposits then known in the Fiskenaesset district and recognized sufficient potential to encourage further exploration. Based on his recommendations, two independent geologists named Bill Brereton and Bill Anderson consolidated the land holdings at Fiskenaesset.
Exploration.
In 2004, True North Gems Inc., a public Canadian junior exploration company established to search for colored gemstones at high northern latitudes, acquired the Fiskenaesset property from Brereton and Anderson and identified the Greenland Ruby as an important coloured gemstone occurrence. The company was motivated by the success of their competitors in the Canadian diamond fields beginning in 1991.
True North Gems hired local residents from Qeqertarsuatsiaat and Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, to help explore the district and, over the course of the next three years, increased the number of ruby occurrences known from six to twenty nine. They bulk sampled the main deposits. True North Gems paid for Canadian gem and jewelry experts to come to the community and train the locals in order to assist them in developing a cottage industry making ruby jewelry and mounting collector specimens. 
In four years between 2004 and 2008, True North has collected a total of thirteen mini-bulk samples; from seven ruby showings: Siggartartulik; Lower Annertusoq; Upper Annertusoq; Kigutilik; Ruby Island; Qaqqatsiaq; and, Aappaluttoq. In 2004 and 2005, True North collected three tonne samples from each of Siggartartulik, Lower Annertusoq, Upper Annertusoq, Kigutilik, Ruby Island, and Qaqqatsiaq. In 2006, True North collected 30 tonnes from Kigutilik and from Aappaluttoq. In 2007 True North collected three separate samples at Aappaluttoq totalling 82.8 tonnes. In 2008, an additional 125 tonnes of material was collected from Aappaluttoq by blasting and 30-40 tonnes of ruby bearing overburden was collected. To date True North Gems has not sold any ruby material as it is not permitted to do so until it has received a mining permit.
In 2007 and 2008 True North Gems drilled a ruby deposit in the Fiskenaesset district at a place called Aappaluttoq. A total of 6,974 metres of diamond drilling was completed in 65 holes. Ruby and pink sapphire was found in 48 of the holes. At Aappaluttoq, the ruby and pink sapphire mineralization occurs in a corundum (ruby-sapphire) alteration band that exhibits trench-to-trench and drill hole-to-drill hole continuity. This corundum band is contained within a broader phlogopite and pargasite-enriched alteration zone referred to as the Host Zone Alteration. The ruby mineralization at the Aappaluttoq prospect has been traced in drilling and surface exposures over a strike length of 135 metres and a vertical depth of 143 metres. The closely associated Aappaluttoq Deep Zone has now been traced in drilling over a strike length of 85 metres and continues to vertical depths of 70–143 metres below surface. Both zones remain open along strike and to depth.
On 17 May 2011 an initial resource calculation was announced for Aappaluttoq. The resource included indicated resources of 189,150 tonnes of material hosting 59 million grams (296 million carats) of corundum and inferred a further 21 million grams (109 million carats) of material was present at Aappaluttoq to a depth of 65m. The deposit remains open along strike and to depth. The resource is National Instrument 43-101 compliant and is the first coloured gemstone resource ever to be published under these laws.
True North Gems has initiated a socio-economic impact assessment in anticipation of a commercial ruby mining operation. Stakeholder meetings were held in Nuuk and Qeqertarsuatsiaat in February 2011. The company's proposals for the potential mining operation were well received at the meetings, and more discussions will be undertaken with respect to issues raised; particularly training, employment, and further encouragement of local gemstone and jewelry initiatives. The company's formal filing of a draft exploitation (mining) licence was submitted in June 2011 and was accepted in June 2013. Company and government public hearings were held in August 2013, and negotiations for the formal Impact and Benefit Agreement are ongoing. 
The company was accused of discouraging the villagers from Qeqertarsuatsiaat and elsewhere in Greenland from coming into the area of their active exploration to remove rubies, even though it was argued that the Greenlanders had the right of mineral access under "Section 32" of the country’s Mineral Resources Act administerd by the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum (www.bmp.gl). Section 32 was argued to confirm not only native people's right of access to the land to hunt and fish and prospect for minerals for their own purposes, but also to hand mine gem grade ruby material, even on the legal exploration licenses of other parties. Later legal interpretation established that the right of mineral access did not extend to the removal of gem grade material. This interpretation was contested on the grounds that, among other things, that Denmark as a signature to the UN Declaration on Indigenous Rights should allow such activity as a sustainable livelihoods opportunity.
The 16 August Union generated a paper and electronic email petition in support of their cause. They obtained over 3500 signatures from a country with only 57,000 people, about 4.5% of the population. Another 1000 people internationally signed over the internet. 
In December, 2009, a new Mineral Resources Act was passed which, among other changes, created a legal system for small-scale exploration and mining of minerals. These provisions were specifically and exclusively designed to allow Greenlanders to obtain mining rights with a simplified system and reduced fees.
The 16 August Union contends that Greenlanders cannot afford the cost of the permits and that the new permit system is too complex and claim that BMP’s actions show that the government favours foreign mining interests over Greenlanders. The number of permits issued under the new provisions is slowly increasing.
The 16 August Union is looking for the law makers to uphold their constitutional claim to traditional rights under section 32 of the mineral act and in doing so create the opportunity for responsible small scale mining to take place.

Wilsons River (New South Wales)

Wilsons River, a perennial river and part of the Richmond River catchment, is situated in the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, Australia.
Course and features.
The river rises on the eastern slopes of Jerusalem Mountain within the Nightcap National Park, and flows generally southeast, west southwest, and south, joined by five minor tributaries, before reaching its mouth at its confluence with the Richmond River, near Coraki; descending over its course. 
The river passes through the major regional city of Lismore, where it is subject to seasonal flooding.
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Wilsons River are the Aboriginal people of the Bundjalung clan, who lived as hunter-gatherers.
Wilsons Creek was named after William Wilson, the first settler in Lismore, in the period 1844-5; and in 1976, the stream was renamed as Wilsons River.
Environment and ecology.
Because of the extensive development of the catchment for agricultural and urban purposes the river system is adversely impacted by inputs of sediments, nutrients, gross polutants and other contaminants. Efforts by Landcare groups and various government bodies such as the Northern Rivers Catchment Management Authority and Rous Water have been initiated to rehabilitate sections of the river.
New South Wales Fisheries have records that indicate the Eastern freshwater cod once was prevalent in the Wilsons River Catchment but no sightings have been recorded for many years and it is now thought to be locally extinct. In the lower portion of the Wilsons River the declared noxious species European Carp is common. Additionally, there are several species of noxious aquatic weed that occur such as Alligator Weed and Parrots Feather.
Floods.
The Wilsons River floods regularly, and on occasion, has inundated Lismore. It's for this reason that many of Lismore's homes are built elevated, in a fashion known as "hiset" and why Lismore has extensive levee systems to protect the city from all but the worst floods.
The frequency of flooding is due to several contributing factors. One is the relatively high rainfall in the headwaters of the system (The Rummery Park Rain Gauge is the Wettest in NSW) and the unusual geomorphology which means that the River flows away from the sea for a significant distance then south after reaching Lismore before joining the Richmond River which eventually flows north east to the Pacific Ocean. In fact the headwaters of the Wilsons River are approximately 180 km from the ocean despite parts of the catchment being less than 2 km from the ocean. Additionally, the balance of the catchment is located near sea level reducing the hydraulic gradient and slowing the rate at which water can flow.
The flood plain of the Wilsons River is quite large. The main flood plain starts near the rivers confluence with Byron Creek and extends all the way to Coraki where it joins the Richmond River and its flood plain. In places the flood plain can be several kilometres wide. The flood plain, like others around the world is generally quite fertile, albeit quite clayey. However, the high frequency of flooding limits its use mainly to pastures for cattle grazing and dairying enterprises.
Historical river trade.
It is likely that the indigenous population of the region would have used canoes and other river craft to transport themselves and trade along the Wilsons River before the appearance of Europeans.
Following the arrival of the first Europeans many of the towns and villages along the Wilsons River including Lismore, Wyrallah, Bexhill and Coraki, were located or developed at their present sites due to the most effective form of transport at the time, river going ships and boats. The Wilsons River, then known as the North Arm of the Richmond River, and the Richmond River itself was named and charted by Henry John Rous in 1828. It was the furthest navigable section of the river system and provided the access necessary for shipping out the region’s most valuable commodity at the time with was the red cedar which was to be steadily cut from the Big Scrub subtropical rainforest that once covered most of the region.
Goods regularly transported early in the 20th century included bacon, maize, eggs, butter, tallow, poulty and sawn logs. Ships included the Cavanba, Tomki, City of Grafton and Wyoming.)
The last transport shipping company to operate on the Richmond and Wilsons rivers closed in the 1960s.
Tributaries.
The Wilsons River has several tributaries, including Leycester Creek, Coopers Creek, Pearces Creek and Byron Creek; with Leycester Creek the most downstream major tributary. Additionally, there are numerous other smaller named and unnamed tributaries that join the river. Leycester Creek joins the Wilsons River at Lismore which when in flood at the same time can cause higher than expected flooding at the city. This is particularly caused by the angles of confluence which can direct flow towards the main Lismore Levee. The confluence with Coopers Creek is near the village of Bexhill at Boat Harbour Nature Reserve which is one of the largest remnants of the Big Scrub rainforest. It is also the furthest upstream tidal location on the river. Byron Creek has its headwaters from the Tasman Sea. So, like most of the Wilsons River system it is unusual for a coastal river system because if flows inland for a significant distance.
Water supply.
The Wilsons River is the source of a potable water for a large part of the region. Byron Shire Council obtain water from Lavertys Gap Weir on the river. This water is treated at the nearby water treatment plant to supply potable water to the town of Mullumbimby. 
Rous Water obtain water from the fresh water tidal pool upstream of Lismore to supplement the Rocky Creek Dam supply to large parts of the Byron Shire Council, Ballina Shire, Richmond Valley Council and City of Lismore local government areas. This water is pumped to and treated at the Nightcap Water Treatment Plant near Rocky Creek Dam and is reticulated back to the council areas by gravity.
Farmers in the region also use the Wilsons River to supply water for irrigation (mainly pastures) and for stock watering and some domestic supplies. Water in the Coopers Creek tributary has been historically over-allocated and is therefore the subject of a water sharing plan developed by the NSW Government.

Manny Kimmel, born Emmanuel Kimmel, was a notable underworld figure between the 1930s and 1960s. Founder of the Kinney Parking Company, a chain of parking lots and garages, which evolved into the media conglomerate Warner Communications, and ultimately the present day Time Warner media empire.
According to Connie Bruck, he cooperated with the major racketeer and bootlegger in Newark, Abner Zwillman, leasing his garages for storage of liquor during the Prohibition Era. FBI kept tabs on him for his business dealings with known mafia figures, and compelled to testify in the trials of two of them, Abner Zwillman and Joe Adonis. 
An illegal bookie in his early years, running the numbers game and other illicit gambling bookmaking activities in New Jersey. Perhaps the biggest horseracing bookmaker in New York at one time, and owner of several racing horses himself. He is also known for his early forays into card counting in blackjack in the early fifties as the Mr. X in the classic book on card counting, "Beat the Dealer" by Edward O. Thorp.
He is mentioned in at least two other historical books (according to Amazon), including the "Master of the Game: Steve Ross and the Creation of Time Warner" by Connie Bruck. In this well-known book, the multi-year evolution of the company Kimmel founded, Kinney Parking Company, into Time Warner of today is described.

California Wilderness Act of 1984

The California Wilderness Act of 1984 is a federal law (Public Law 98-425), passed by the United States Congress on September 28, 1984, that authorized the addition of over within the state of California to the National Wilderness Preservation System. 
Background-Roadless Areas.
The historic Wilderness Act passed in 1964 provided guidelines and provisions for future wilderness additions, of which this California Act is one of.
One key provision called for evaluating roadless areas for future wilderness classification. 
The US Forest Service began its evaluation in 1967 and was known as the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation or "RARE." Each area had to be at least , have only foot trails, and be undeveloped. The first evaluation and inventory was completed in April 1972 and after public input, a final list of 16 roadless areas came out in 1973. This list had three-quarters of a million acres (4,000 km²) of public land spread across 12 national forests.<br>
A second evaluation (RARE II) was done in 1977 that was more extensive and had more time for public input. It was completed and published in 1978. RARE II guidelines were a bit more relaxed than its predecessor. It allowed slight traces of human impact, such as limited fencing, old fire towers and unimproved roads, as long as these traces did not disturb the "wilderness" ambiance. This second inventory had 69 roadless areas totaling almost , 176 non-wildernesss areas of about and 118 further planning areas. At this point in history, things got a bit complicated. The state of California sued the US Forest Service charging that the agency's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process was faulty as it only had public comments from northern California and had ignored the remaining 97.5 per cent of the state's population. <br>In a letter, Regional Forester Smith commented,
"...On balance, I think RARE II was a success...for the first time somebody thought about what the wilderness system ought to look like when it was complete. For the first time somebody took the time to estimate the criteria and characteristics of a complete National Wilderness Preservation System. RARE II ...brought the question of land use, particularly wilderness, to the attention of more people in this country than any other effort."

San Bruno, CA
The old 1978 inventory was updated and revised in 1983 but was still too controversial in many states. It finally came down to a state-by-state basis instead of a nation-wide recommendation.
The California Wilderness Act included the inventoried roadless areas from RARE II as well as other areas recommended by environmentalists.
Special provisions.
The California Wilderness Act of 1984 contains several special provisions allowing certain uses and activities within the wilderness areas that are otherwise prohibited. These exemptions are:
1. Motorized access-
§101(a)(2) and (25) allow continued access for livestock facilities in two specific areas which are the Wolf Creek drainage area in the Toiyabe National Forest
2. Water Infrastructure-
§101(a)(25) protects rights for water diversion and use, including construction, operation, maintenance, and repair in the hydroelectric project on the North Fork San Joaquin River.
Minaret Area Considerations.
When the Wilderness Act of 1964 was being drafted California politicians were concerned about maintaining the viability of plans for a highway or tunnel connecting the Eastern Sierra and the San Joaquin Valley. These plans centered on the Minaret Summit area as the distance between the end of Minaret Road, which runs northeast into the Sierras from North Fork, California, and the end of the Red's Meadow Road, running west from Mammoth Lakes, California is less than 10 miles. The Act excluded an area southwest of Minaret Summit to create a corridor for this possibility.
During his time as Governor of California, Ronald Reagan made a horse packing trip into the area. Afterwards he supported conservationists' efforts to prevent this highway. Reagan continued his efforts after being elected President in 1980 and his influence helped the area to be eventually designated wilderness by this legislation. The Sierra Nevada escarpment is now a continuous wilderness from Round Mountain (near Inyokern) to Tioga Pass, a distance of about 150 miles.
The "G-O Road".
The passage of the California Wilderness Act created the Siskiyou Wilderness within the Six Rivers, Klamath and Siskiyou national forests. Within this wilderness area is a portion of the forest road connecting the towns of Gasquet and Orleans (hence the term "G-O Road") which traverses land traditionally used by Native Americans for religious practices. The Forest Service planned to pave a section of the road and conduct a timber sale in the early 1970s . A lawsuit filed by Native Americans to stop this road's upgrade and associated timber harvest went all the way to the US Supreme Court. The California Wilderness Act, by designating the Siskiyou Wilderness area in 1984, made the debate a moot point as it prohibits road construction and logging.
The US Forest Service planned to upgrade and pave a segment of the road that goes through an area called Chimney Rock. In addition, a timber harvest was also scheduled for this area. In 1975, the Forest Service released a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) as required by the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. In response to public comments received on the environmental statement, including consideration of other routes and appeals by the Sierra Club and a group of Native Americans, the Secretary of Agriculture, Richard E. Lyng, supported the Chief Forester and Regional Forester's decision favoring the Chimney Rock Corridor.<br>
In 1977 the Forest Service issued a second DEIS for construction of the G-O Road. After public discussion on this second DEIS, the Forest Service hired an external, professional anthropological consulting firm called Theodoratus Cultural Research, to estimate the effect of building the G-O Road and harvesting timber in the Chimney Rock Section of the Six Rivers National Forest.
Theodoratus Cultural Research, Inc. reported that a cultural conflict existed between Indian religious activity and Forest Service management practices. They concluded that "intrusions on the sanctity of the...high country are . . . potentially destructive of the very core of Northwest religious beliefs and practices." They recommended against completing the G-O Road.
In 1982, the Forest Service decided not to adopt this recommendation, and it prepared a final environmental impact statement for construction of the road.
Several groups, including a Native American organization and individuals, nature organizations, and the State of California—challenged both the roadbuilding and timber harvesting decisions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Respondents claimed that the Forest Service's decisions violated the Free Exercise of Religion Clause in the First Amendment, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), and several other federal statutes.
After trial, the District Court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the Forest Service from constructing the Chimney Rock section of the G-O road or putting the timber harvesting management plan into effect. (Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn. v. Peterson, 565 F.Supp. 586 (1983)). The court found that both actions would violate the Free Exercise Clause because they "would seriously damage the salient visual, aural, and environmental qualities of the high country." The court also found that both proposed actions would violate the FWPCA, and that the environmental impact statements for construction of the road were deficient under the NEPA. Finally, the court concluded that both projects would breach the Government's trust responsibilities to protect water and fishing rights reserved for Native Americans of Hoopa Valley. The Forest Service appealed the decision.
While an appeal was pending before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the California Wilderness Act of 1984 was passed, which means that timber harvesting, and road construction are forbidden.
The Ninth Circuit Court upheld the lower court's decision.
In 1987 The US Supreme court heard arguments in the case, and overturned the lower court's rulings by a 5-3 decision. Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinion which basically stated that the First Amendment rights of the Native Americans have not been violated because the actions of the Forest Service do not prohibit the practice of religion. <br>
As stated in the Opinion:
" This does not and cannot imply that incidental effects of government programs, which may make it more difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs, require government to bring forward a compelling justification for its otherwise lawful actions. The crucial word in the constitutional text is "prohibit"..."
Justice Brennan wrote the dissenting opinion, stating,"I thus cannot accept the Court's premise that the form of the government's restraint on religious practice, rather than its effect, controls our constitutional analysis. Respondents here have demonstrated that construction of the G-O road will completely frustrate the practice of their religion, for, as the lower courts found, the proposed logging and construction activities will virtually destroy respondents' religion, and will therefore necessarily force them into abandoning those practices altogether.

Alnur Mussayev () was the former head of Kazakhstan's National Security Committee (KNB) under the tenure of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He served from May 1997 to September 1998, then returned for a second term from August 1999 to May 2001 after his predecessor Nurtai Abykayev was sacked in a scandal over the sale of old MiG fighter planes to North Korea.
In 2007, Mussayev fled Kazakhstan along with his deputy Rakhat Aliyev to Vienna, Austria. Mussayev accused the government of widespread corruption and payments of millions of dollars in bribes by western oil companies to President Nazarbayev. The government of Kazakhstan has convicted him of crimes in absentia as a result of his defection.
An attempted kidnapping of Mussayev took place in Vienna in September 2008. The Austrian government declined comment on the perpetrators' origins at the time. In a January 2010 trial, defendant Ildar A., one of three men charged with the kidnap attempt on Mussayev, was found not guilty by an Austrian court. Mussayev described the verdict as "politically motivated" and an "attempt to please Kazakhstan". During the trial, Mussayev claimed not to know Ildar A., but he admitted in press comments soon after that this was not entirely accurate, as he knew the defendant professionally but not personally; he explained the discrepancy by claiming that his oath to Kazakhstan prevented him from revealing this information.

SP70 self-propelled gun was a scheme set up by several European nations including the UK, Germany and Italy beginning in 1973. The project was shelved in favour of the US M109, which was already in service. The SP70 was 'outgunned' on several occasions by the M109 and further development was cancelled in the 1980s.
The role envisioned for the SP70, which was to replace the widely used U.S. M109 self-propelled howitzer, was ultimately fulfilled by the AS-90, or self-propelled gun for the nineties, another self-propelled 155 mm howitzer system, which was originally created by an independent team which had anticipated that the SP70 project would fail.

Frank Valenti

Frank J. Valenti (September 14, 1911 – September 20, 2008) was boss of the criminal organization known as the Rochester crime family from 1964 to 1972. As the head of the organization he oversaw gambling, prostitution and extortion rackets operating in the city of Rochester, New York.
Frank and his brother Constenze "Stanley" Valenti were among the 100+ Mafiosi that attended the legendary Apalachin Meeting in 1957. At the time, Frank was underboss of the family. Joe Valachi identified the Valenti brothers as central figures in the Mafia when he became a government witness in 1963. Valachi also stated that Frank was a soldier in the Bonanno crime family of New York City.
According to the U.S. Social Security Death Index, Frank was born in Pittsburgh, PA where he became a powerful crime figure throughout the 1930s - 1950s. Valenti also owned a chain of Spaghetti Village restaurants in PA. In 1958, Frank's brother Stanley was boss of the Rochester crime family and refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding questioning about the Apalachin Meeting. As a result, Constenze was sentenced to 16 months in prison. Jake Russo took this opportunity to seize control of the family. Frank tried to intervene but was ordered out of the state for 3 years following a conviction for violation of the election laws. He moved back to Pittsburgh in the early 1960s, serving as a capo in the Pittsburgh crime family under John LaRocca. In 1964, with support from the LaRocca family, Valenti returned to Rochester and took control of the family. Jake Russo disappeared around that time, never to be seen again.
In 1970, Valenti informed Stefano Magaddino that the Rochester crime family would no longer pay tribute to Buffalo; the Rochester crime family was on its own, with support from the Pittsburgh crime family. He had a stint in federal prison on extortion charges, before moving to Arizona, and then Texas. 
He died on September 20, 2008 at a nursing home in Sugar Land outside Houston at the age of 97.

Kamakura Kaidō

The three main routes.
The three main roads in the Kantō region were called ("Upper Route"), ("Middle Route"), and ("Lower Route"). Their course is well known because it's described in several medieval books. They ended at the Shinto gate (torii) at the entrance of Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū in Kamakura. Like the other routes, these roads were built to allow quick army movements from and to Kamakura and were of great importance during the many internal wars of the period. The "Kami no Michi", in particular, was used by Nitta Yoshisada for his 1333 attack on Kamakura, and all the battlefields of that campaign (for example and , both in today's Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, or in today's Fuchū) are therefore along its course. 
The "Kamakura Kaidō/Ōkan" network remained important during the Muromachi period (1336- 1573) because Kamakura continued to be essential to control the Kantō region, however, after the last Kantō kubō Ashikaga Shigeuji was driven out of Kamakura and established himself in Shimōsa Province, the Late Hōjō clan supremacy made Kantō's political and economic center move to Odawara. The final blow to the network was given by the Tokugawa, who in the 17th century made Edo their capital. With Kamakura's importance waning, the network fell in disrepair and in places disappeared.
Even though they are described in several old texts like the Azuma Kagami, the Taiheiki, the Gukanshō and the the three roads' exact courses aren't known with certainty, and their description can therefore vary considerably with the source. The following are considered the most likely.
The "Kami no Michi".
From Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū's gate, the "Kami no Michi" passed through the Kewaizaka Pass, then Susaki, Watauchi (today's Fujisawa), Karasawa, Iida (within today's Yokohama), then Seya, Tsuruma (today's Machida), Tamagawa, Bubai, Fuchū, Kokubunji, Sayama, and Ogawa, then, at the Usui Pass, divided in three, forming the (that went towards today's Nagano Prefecture), (that went towards today's Gunma Prefecture) and the , that went towards Musashi Province, today's Tokyo Prefecture. For unknown reasons, this route appears to be what the Azuma Kagami calls "Shimo no Michi".
The "Naka no Michi".
The "Naka no Michi" departed from Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū with a left turn and passed through the Kobukurozaka Pass, Yamanouchi, Ofuna, Kasama (within today's Yokohama), Nagaya, Futamatagawa, and Nakayama, finally joining the "Kami no Michi" there. In Kamakura this particular road is still known as "Kamakura Kaidō".
The "Shimo no Michi".
The "Shimo no Michi" was a branch of the "Naka no Michi" that departed before Tsurumi (within today's Yokohama), then crossed Maruko, Shibuya, Hatogaya, Yono, Iwatsuki, Iwatsuki, Koga, and Yūki, then reaching Utsunomiya. In Maruko (near today's Kawasaki), the "Shimo no Michi" divided into the and the the first going to Kisarazu, the second going to Ishioka in Northern Ibaraki Prefecture.

The Athenaeum Hotel

The Athenaeum is a family-owned five-star hotel overlooking Green Park in Piccadilly, London.
History.
Hope House was built at 116 Piccadilly in 1849/50 by Henry Pelham-Clinton, the 6th Duke of Newcastle. The name Athenaeum first appears around 1864 when the house was bought by the Junior Athenaeum Club. The house was redeveloped in the 1930s as an art deco apartment block, still called the Athenaeum.
In 1971 the Rank Organisation purchased the 1930s Athenaeum Court apartment block, opening it as The Athenaeum Hotel after a two year refurbishment. Through Rank's direct links to Hollywood the hotel attracted guests including Steven Spielberg, Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford, Lauren Bacall, Liza Minnelli and Warren Beatty. Rank encouraged its stars (including Elizabeth Taylor) to take up residence at the hotel whilst working on film projects in England. The Hollywood Reporter observed that there were more movie stars to be seen in London's Athenaeum than in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel.
For over twenty years Sally Bulloch was the Executive Manager.
In 1992, the Athenaeum was purchased by Ralph Trustees Limited, a family-run business who also own The Grove in Hertfordshire and the Runnymede Hotel & Spa near Windsor.
Location.
The Athenaeum's postcode is W1J 7BJ, right in the heart of Mayfair. The nearest tube station is Green Park.
Kid's Concierge.
The Hotel has a dedicated Kid's Concierge service which takes care of children's needs and helps families to plan itineraries. The Athenaeum also provides gender-appropriate toys to children upon arrival.
Awards.
The hotel has 5 red stars and 2 red rosettes from the AA.
The website travelandleisure.com put the Athenaeum in its list of the 500 best hotels in the world in 2008.
Afternoon Tea at the Athenaeum has received an Award of Excellence from the UK Tea Guild for Top London Afternoon Tea 2008.

Elgol

Elgol (Scottish Gaelic: Ealaghol) is a village on the shores of Loch Scavaig towards the end of the Strathaird peninsula in the Isle of Skye, in the Scottish Highlands.
Name.
According to tradition, its name derives from a battle fought with five ships by Aella, a follower of Vortigern, against the Picts and Scots (“Aella-gol”).
History.
The Strathaird peninsula was historically a heartland of the Mackinnons, a robustly Jacobite clan. On 4 July 1746, the Young Pretender found sanctuary at Elgol in the course of his wanderings under the protection of Mackinnon of Mackinnon and Captain John Mackinnon of Elgol. The cave where he is said to have waited for a boat to the mainland (“Prince Charlie’s cave”, or “Uamh Phrionnsa”) can still be visited today, a short walk to the south of the village.
Present day.
The village had a considerably higher population prior to the Clearances. It now has a population of approximately 150, a significant proportion of whom are Gaelic speakers. Elgol's scenic attractions have drawn in many outsiders seeking holiday homes and a majority of the properties there are no longer occupied on a year-round basis.
The village is also a terminal for two privately owned boat trips to Loch Coruisk.

That's the Way I Feel About Cha

"That's the Way I Feel About Cha" is a 1972 single co-written, produced and recorded by American rhythm and blues/soul music performer, Bobby Womack, and also became the musician's first crossover Top 40 single on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 27. On the US "Billboard" R&B chart it peaked at number two, starting a four-year run of R&B hits for Womack during that decade.
The single, co-written by Womack, John Grisby and Joe Hicks, was the second release off Womack's "Communication" album. It put Womack on the musical map as a solo artist, after he started his career as lead singer of the family musical group The Valentinos, and a period where he achieved success as a sideman for soul acts such as Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett, and rock singers such as Janis Joplin and Sly Stone.
The song would inspire a few cover versions, with the most notable ones coming from Aretha Franklin from her album "Hey Now Hey (The Other Side of the Sky)" (1973), and also from the blues singer O.V. Wright.
The single featured Womack's brothers from The Valentinos singing background and instrumental background by the Muscle Shoals instrumental band. Womack played his rhythm guitar in sessions. The memorable guitar riff was provided by Jimmy Johnson.

<doc id="19479035" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19479035" title="Thermoplastic polyurethane">
Thermoplastic polyurethane

Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is any of a class of polyurethane plastics with many useful properties, including elasticity, transparency, and resistance to oil, grease and abrasion. Technically, they are thermoplastic elastomers consisting of linear segmented block copolymers composed of hard and soft segments.
Chemistry.
TPU are formed by the reaction of: (1) diisocyanates with short-chain diols (so-called chain extenders) and (2) diisocyanates with long-chain diols. The practically unlimited amount of possible combinations producible by varying the structure and/or molecular weight of the three reaction compounds allows for an enormous variety of different TPU. This allows urethane chemists to fine-tune the polymer’s structure to the desired final properties of the material.
Morphology.
The final resin consists of linear polymeric chains in block-structures. Such chains contain low polarity segments which are rather long (called soft segments), alternating with shorter, high polarity segments (called hard segments). Both types of segments are linked together by covalent links, so that they actually form block-copolymers.
The polarity of the hard pieces creates a strong attraction between them, which causes a high degree of aggregation and order in this phase, forming crystalline or pseudo crystalline areas located in a soft and flexible matrix. This so-called phase separation between both blocks can be more or less important, depending on the polarity and the molecular weight of the flexible chain, the production conditions, etc. The crystalline or pseudo crystalline areas act as physical cross-links, which account for the high elasticity level of TPU, whereas the flexible chains will impart the elongation characteristics to the polymer.
These "pseudo crosslinks", however, disappear under the effect of heat, and thus the classical extrusion, injection moulding and calendering processing methods are applicable to these materials. Consequently, TPU scrap can be reprocessed.
Uses.
TPU has many applications including automotive instrument panels, caster wheels, power tools, sporting goods, medical devices, drive belts, footwear, inflatable rafts, and a variety of extruded film, sheet and profile applications. TPU is also a popular material found in cases of mobile electronic devices, such as mobile phones.
Overview of TPU on the market.
Properties of commercially available TPU include:
The currently available TPUs can be divided mainly in two groups, based on soft segment chemistry:
Table of properties.
"Table 1: Main differences between polyester- and polyether-based TPU."
In other words, polyether-based TPU is used only in cases where excellent hydrolysis and microbial resistance is required, as well as in cases where extreme low temperature flexibility is important.
When stable light colour and non-yellowing performance are required, aliphatic TPU based on aliphatic isocyanates is used.
Recently, BASF has pioneered crosslinking during TPU production, made possible by adding liquid crosslinkers and using a masterbatch. Plant-based bio TPU has been developed for green thermoplastic elastomer applications by Merquinsa and GRECO, marketed as Pearlthane ECO and Isothane respectively.

1949–50 FA Cup

The 1949–50 FA Cup was the 69th season of the world's oldest football cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup. Arsenal won the competition for the third time, beating Liverpool 2–0 in the final at Wembley, through two goals from Reg Lewis.
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. Some matches, however, might be rescheduled for other days if there were clashes with games for other competitions or the weather was inclement. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
First round proper.
At this stage clubs from the Football League Third Division North and South joined the 25 non-league clubs having come through the qualifying rounds. Rotherham United, Reading and A.F.C. Bournemouth, as the strongest Third Division finishers in the previous season, were given a bye to the Third Round. To make the number of matches up, non-league Yeovil Town and Bromley were given byes to this round. 34 matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 26 November 1949. Three were drawn and went to replays.
Second Round Proper.
The matches were played on Saturday, 10 December 1949. Six matches were drawn, with replays taking place later the same week. One of these replays went to a second replay.
Third round proper.
The 44 First and Second Division clubs entered the competition at this stage, along with the three strongest finishers from the previous season's Third Division, Rotherham United, Reading and A.F.C. Bournemouth. The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 7 January 1950. Nine matches were drawn and went to replays, with one of these going to a second replay.
Fourth Round Proper.
The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 28 January 1950. Six games were drawn and went to replays, which were all played in the following midweek match.
Fifth Round Proper.
The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 11 February 1950. There were three replays in total, each taking place four days later.
Sixth Round Proper.
The four quarter-final ties were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 4 March 1950. There were no replays.
Semi-Finals.
The semi-final matches were intended to be played on Saturday, 18 March 1950, although the Liverpool–Everton fixture was not played until the week after. The London derby clash of Arsenal–Chelsea went to a replay, with Arsenal eventually winning their tie to meet Liverpool in the final at Wembley.
Final.
The 1950 FA Cup Final was contested by Arsenal and Liverpool at Wembley. Arsenal won 2–0, with both goals scored by Reg Lewis. Future legendary Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was famously dropped for the final, even after scoring the winning goal against rivals Everton in the semi final.

Jeanson James Ancheta

On May 9, 2006, Jeanson James Ancheta (born 1985) became the first person to be charged for controlling large numbers of hijacked computers or botnets.
Biography.
Ancheta was going to Downey High School in California until 2001 when he dropped out of school. He later entered an alternative program for students with academic or behavioral problems. He worked at an Internet cafe and according to his family wanted to join the military reserves. Around June 2004 he started to work with botnets after discovering rxbot, a common computer worm that could spread his net of infected computers.
Botnets.
Botnet is a jargon term for a collection of software robots, or "bots", that run autonomously and automatically, often for malicious purposes. Hackers have for some time utilized Botnets for various purposes, but Ancheta set himself above the crowd by actively advertising his network of bots on Internet chat channels.
A Web site Ancheta ran included a range of prices he charged people who wanted to rent out the machines, along with guidelines on how many bots were required to bring down a particular type of Web site.
Arrest and sentence.
In November 2005 he was captured in an elaborate sting operation when FBI agents lured him to their local office on the pretext of collecting computer equipment. The arrest was part of the Operation Bot Roast.
On May 9, 2006 Ancheta pleaded guilty to four felony charges of violating United States Code Section 1030, Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers, specifically subsections (a)(5)(A)(i), 1030 (a)(5)(B)(i), and 1030(b). Ancheta must serve 60 months in prison, forfeit a 1993 BMW and more than $58,000 in profit. He must also pay restitution of $15,000 US to the U.S. federal government for infecting the military computers.
