John Rolph (judge)

John Rolph is an American lawyer and officer in the United States Navy's Judge Advocate General corps.
Military career.
Captain John Rolph, JAGC, USN served as both an enlisted man and as an officer in the United States Navy during a 35-year career from 1973 until he retired in 2008. He served as an officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the U.S. Navy from 1982 until 2008. He held many legal positions in the Navy, including prosecutor, defense counsel, staff judge advocate, executive officer and commanding officer. He served as the Command Judge Advocate on board the USS INDEPENDENCE (CVA-62) from 1988–1990, was the first Navy instructor/professor of law at the Army JAG School in Charlottesville, VA (International Law Department—1991-1993), and served as the Executive Officer and Commanding Officer of the Naval Legal Service Office in Norfolk, VA (1996–1998). His judicial positions include the following:
Guantanamo challenge.
Rolph's appointment was mentioned in a jurisdictional appeal filed by Omar Khadr's lawyers.
Khadr's lawyers had argued that the Military Commissions Act only authorized the Secretary of Defense to appoint a Chief Judge, not a Deputy Chief Judge. 
And they pointed out that Rolph had been appointed the Deputy Chief Judge not by the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, but also by Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England. In June 2007, in his role as Deputy Chief Judge, Rolph had completed the compilation of the Court's "rules of practice", which he published on June 28, 2007. Deputy Secretary England approved the rules of practice on August 13, 2007. Khadr's lawyers argued that Rolph lacked the jurisdiction to publish the Court's rules of practice—that only the Chief Justice had that authority. And they argued that only the Secretary of Defense had the authority to approve the rules; not his Deputy.
Khadr's lawyers' appeal was heard by the Court of Military Commission Review itself, which ruled, on September 19, 2008, that the Military Commissions Act gave the Secretary of Defense broad discretion in how he delegated the tasks involved in running and overseeing the court, and that the Rolph rules of practice compilation were properly authorized.

Family and private life.
Von Prittwitz originated from the old noble house of "von Prittwitz" and was the son of Prussian General of the Infantry and Director of Fortifications Moritz Karl Ernst von Prittwitz and of Domicilie von Colbe. 
On 26 November 1885 he married Franziska Freiin von Türckheim zu Altdorf (b. 14 June 1855 in Karlsruhe; d. 8 May 1936 ibidem), daughter of Grand Duchal Badenian Chamberlain, envoy and land owner Hans Freiherr von Türckheim zu Altdorf, Lord of Altdorf and Orschweier (Lahr District, Baden), and of Fanny Freiin von Hardenberg (House of Ober-Wiederstedt).
Von Prittwitz was a Knight of Justice in the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).

In 1851 von Prittwitz joined the Guard Artillery in Berlin, became Second Lieutenant in 1853 and First Lieutenant in 1861. In the Second Schleswig War against Denmark he was assigned to General Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army. Here he participated in Wyk auf Föhr in the capture of Otto Christian Hammer and on 29 June 1864 took part in the crossing of the sound to the isle of Als.
Promoted to Captain with 32 years of age in 1865, he commanded a battery of Guard Artillery at Berlin since 1867.
At the onset of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 he was commander of a mounted Guard battery and as such participated in the campaign in Bohemia. This battery was assigned to the newly formed Hanoverian Field Artillery Regiment No. 10. Prittwitz was thus deployed to Hanover in autumn 1866 but only after three quarters of a year he returned to Berlin.
After the war Prittwitz undertook a number of journeys abroad, including England, France, Spain and Italy, and in 1869 he went to Romania as counselor of Prince Frederick III of Hohenzollern with whom he travelled a part of the Orient.
In the Franco-Prussian War Prittwitz took part in the battles of Gravelotte, Sedan - here he was wounded by a grenade - and in the conquest of Montmédy. His battery was the first to reach the hill of St. Privat near Gravelotte and fiercely fought the French, which not only caused designated emperor Wilhem I, but also Napoleon III to congratulate.
There is no information about his further career.
Honours and decorations.
Prittwitz was made an honorary citizen of Wyk auf Föhr.

A love-in is a peaceful public gathering focused on meditation, love, music, and/or use of psychedelic drugs. The term was coined by Los Angeles radio comedian Peter Bergman, who also hosted the first one in March or April 1967 (sources disagree) in Elysian Park.
It has been interpreted in different ways by different organizations, but is often connected to protesting local, social or environmental issues. 
Such protests were held in opposition to the Vietnam War.

Robert T. Davies

Robert T. Davies (May 19, 1849 - March 22, 1916) was a Canadian businessman and Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorse owner and breeder. 
Born in Toronto, Ontario, he studied at Park School and Upper Canada College, in the early 1870s Robert Davies married Margaret Anne Taylor, the daughter of John Taylor, owner of paper mills in Todmorden Mills, Ontario. By the turn of the century, they had had eight children and owned a large home at 244 Don Mills Rd (now Broadview/O'Connor) in Todmorden Mills they called "Chester Park."
In 1879, Robert Davies founded the Dominion Brewing Company Ten years later, his success led to the selling of shares in the company to a group of investors arranged by a London, England banking house. After his wife's family encountered financial difficulties, in 1901 Davies acquired most of the Taylor family holdings in the Don Valley, including two paper mills and the Don Valley Brick Works. By the time of his death in 1916, Robert Davies was one of the wealthiest people in Toronto.
Thoroughbred racing.
As a boy, Robert Davies developed a love for horse racing and for a while was on jockey in Thoroughbred flat racing. In 1865 at the racetrack in London, Ontario, the then sixteen-year-old rode in that year's edition of the Queen's Plate. He soon turned to training his own horses and at age twenty-two raced and trained Floss who won the 1871 edition of the Plate. The following year, a horse he bred named Fearnaught won the Plate. As of 2008 Robert Davies is the only person to ever ride in the Queen's Plate as well as own, train and breed winners of that race. 
Davies purchased the filly Southern Maid from Kentucky breeder, John E. Madden. A daughter of 1898 Kentucky Derby winner, Plaudit, Southern Maid was voted the retrospective American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly of 1913. As a broodmare for the Davies family, she produced 1922 King's Plate winner, South Shore.
In 1888, Davies purchased a large property in the Don Valley from his farther-in-law on which he established a breeding operation he dubbed Thorncliffe Farms. He raced horses both in Thoroughbred flat racing and in harness racing under the "nom de course", Thorncliffe Stable.
Davies served as president of the Canadian Horse Breeder's Association. A vice-president of the Ontario Jockey Club from 1895 to 1904, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the lifting of the rule that prevented horses foaled outside of the Province of Ontario from competing in the King's Plate.
Robert Davies died in 1916 at "Chester Park" and was buried in the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto. For his contribution to the industry, in 2001 he was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in the Builders category. His estate sold Thorncliffe Farms to a group of investors from Baltimore, Maryland who built a horse Thorncliffe Park Raceway.
Davie's Dominion Brewery complex at Queen Street East and Sumach Street continued until 1936, but the brewery complex was renovated from 1987 to 1990 and is now Dominion Square (and used by Vistek as commercial office space) and the old Dominion Hotel is now home to the pub Dominion on Queen.

Electric dragbike

An electric dragbike is an electric motorcycle used for drag racing.
Electric dragsters have come of age with new developments in battery and motor technology. Electric motors powered by lithium cells can deliver power-to-weight ratios similar to high performance gasoline engines. Drag races last around ten seconds so battery range is not an issue. A number of electric dragbikes and dragsters (cars) are competing with Top Fuel classes. Electric drag racing records are listed at NEDRA.
Batteries.
Electric dragbike tend to use lithium-ion or nickel-metal hydride cells due to their higher energy density which means they are less bulky to carry. In addition fewer cells are needed compared to a car as the "payload" of bike and rider is lighter. Typical weights: rider, bike excluding battery weight.

U.S. Pro Indoor

The U.S. Pro Indoor (mainly known as such during its run, but also as the "U.S. Professional Indoor", the "Ebel U.S. Pro Indoor", the "Comcast U.S. Indoor", and the "Advanta Championships") is a defunct professional tennis tournament played on indoor carpet courts, and indoor hard courts. It was part of the World Championship Tennis (WCT) circuit, between 1970 and 1986 it was a major ranking tournament of the Grand Prix Championship Series after which it became a Super Series tournament of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour. It was held annually first at the Spectrum, and then at the CoreStates Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, from 1968 to 1998.
History.
The "United States Professional Indoor" tennis championships were first created in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1968, as part of the newly created WCT circuit, rival of the National Tennis League (NTL). As the first event of the season, the Philadelphia "U.S. Professional Indoor" attracted all WCT stars at the Philadelphia Spectrum at each of its yearly editions, with Rod Laver, John Newcombe or Marty Riessen winning the event in the early 1970s. After the WCT absorbed the NTL in 1970, the tournament continued to exist within the WCT tour until 1979, when the event officially became part of the Grand Prix Tour, precursor of the current ATP Tour. 
As part of the Grand Prix's top tier tournaments until 1986, the Philadelphia event known as the "U.S. Pro Indoor" since 1973, saw American players dominating the fields in the 1970s and 1980s, with Tim Mayotte reaching four finals, World No. 1s Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe six finals each, and Czechoslovak Ivan Lendl three. In 1985, Swiss watch company Ebel S.A. started its six-year sponsorship of the event, the tournament becoming until 1990 the "Ebel U.S. Pro Indoor". The event entered the new ATP circuit in 1990 as part of the Championship Series, to see eighteen-year-old, and future US Open champion Pete Sampras win his first career title against Andrés Gómez. 
In 1991, the event lost Ebel's sponsorship, and went back to being the "U.S. Pro Indoor" for two editions, before Comcast became the sponsor of the event in 1992, effectively saving it from being discontinued. In the following years, the "Comcast U.S. Indoor"'s prize money was reduced to less than a million dollars, preventing the creation of attractive line ups, and gaining the nickname "Comatose U.S. Indoor". In 1997, Advanta, already the sponsor of the 1971-created women's tournament of Philadelphia, the Advanta Championships, since 1995, took upon the sponsorship of the men's event, which also became the "Advanta Championships". Pete Sampras won his third and fourth Philadelphia titles in the last two editions of the event, now taking place on indoor hard courts at the CoreStates Center, before it was definitely discontinued in 1998.

Special non-state-to-state relations

Special Non-State-to-State Relations () is a term used by Ma Ying-jeou, the President of the Republic of China (often called "Taiwan") to describe the nature of relations between the Taiwan Area and the Mainland China Area. President Ma has used the term at least once, although to describe the term as a concept or policy would be premature, especially as it describes those relations loosely in terms of what they are not (rather than what those relations are).
Departing from the former presidents Lee Teng-hui's Special state-to-state relations and Chen Shui-bian's One Country on Each Side in which both define the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) as states and the relationship between the two as one between two states, Ma Ying-jeou defines the relations as a special relationship between two areas within one state. The ROC government considers that state as the ROC, while the PRC government considers that state as the PRC. While the governing authority in one area cannot recognise the authority in other area as a legitimate government, neither would deny the other side being the "de facto" governing authority of one area of the state. According to this view the relations between the two areas are special and laws relating to international relations cannot be applied.
Background.
President Ma Ying-jeou on 2 September 2008 stated in an interview with the Mexico-based press, Sol de Mexico, that the relations between mainland China and Taiwan are "special," but "not that between two states", because neither the Constitution of the People's Republic of China nor the Constitution of the ROC allows for another state to exist in their respective claimed territory. He conceded the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present, but citing the 1992 Consensus as a temporary measure for the issues, as both accept the One China principle but agrees to differ on the definition of that one "China".
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi () later elaborated the president's statement and said that under the 11th amendment of the ROC Constitution and the "Statute Governing the Relations Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and Mainland Area", the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China is one between two regions of one country. From the ROC's perspective, that country is the ROC.
Ma Ying-jeou was interviewed by the Japanese magazine "World" on 7 October 2008. In answering questions relating to the "Special non-state-to-state relations", he said that the ROC "definitely is an independent sovereign state", and under its constitution, mainland China is part of the territory of the ROC. The ROC cannot recognise the existence of another state in its territory, nor does the People's Republic of China want to recognize the ROC. In other words, the ROC does not consider the PRC a state. Accordingly, laws relating to international relations cannot be applied regarding the relations between Taiwan and mainland China.
In an interview with the Central News Agency on 25 October 2008, Ma Ying-jeou clarified that conceptualising Taiwan and mainland China as "two areas" was not his invention, but believed the framework offered a way for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to sidestep sovereignty questions in pursuing closer ties as long as each side did not deny the other's existence. Ma said consultations between the two sides' intermediary bodies have been conducted under such a "mutual non-denial" framework. According to Ma, the "two areas" concept could be dated back to 1991, when then-President Lee Teng-hui announced the termination of the Period of National Mobilisation for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion to acknowledge the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are under separate rule. The move symbolised that the communist regime established on 1 October 1949 in mainland China is no longer considered by the ROC as a "rebellious group," but "a governing authority that has de facto rule of the mainland," Ma said. Over the past 17 years, several other concepts have been put forth by the country's leaders to try to define Cross-Strait relations, but none has been proven feasible, he said. These include the special state-to-state relations proposed by Lee in 1999, and the one country on each side theory raised by then President Chen Shui-bian in 2002, Ma noted.

The Christopher Street Connection

The Christopher Street Connection are a professional wrestling tag team consisting of Buff E and Mace Mendoza. They primarily compete in Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic independent promotions, most notably, World-1 South, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, Ring of Honor and Frank Goodman's United States Xtreme Wrestling. Frequent opponents of such tag teams as Da Hit Squad, The Carnage Crew and The Heartbreak Express, they fought both The Heartbreak Express and The Extreme Horsemen (Steve Corino and Ricky Landell) over the WSL World Tag Team Championship in early 2007.
For nearly a decade, the Christopher Street Connection competed as the only "openly gay" tag team on the independent circuit during the early to mid-2000s. Similar to the ring styles of World Championship Wrestling's West Hollywood Blondes (Lenny and Lodi) and the World Wrestling Federation's Billy and Chuck, their in-ring personas included suggestive behavior, flirting with their opponents and, on occasion, male members in the audience. The team was originally managed by Rob Feinstein, under the name Fun Athletic Guy. 
They also had a series of female valets including Allison Danger, Ariel and Jailbait.
Career.
Jersey All Pro Wrestling (2000-2001).
Both trained by Homicide and Laithon, Buff E and Mace Mendoza both made their singles debuts during the late-1990s prior to their debut as the Christopher Street Connection. Their name was a reference to the real-life Christopher Street in Manhattan, New York where the Stonewall Riots occurred in 1969. They were introduced with their manager Fun Athletic Guy and later joined by Chris Cabana as well as valets Allison Danger, Ariel and Jailbait. They also competed for the Long Island Wrestling Federation during their early careers.
In early-2000, they began wrestling for Jersey All Pro Wrestling facing The Sickness (Twiggy Ramirez and Adorable Anthony) and NC-17 (Lil Joka and Angel Martinez) at house shows in Bayonne and Sayreville, New Jersey before losing to Da Hit Squad (Mafia and Monsta Mack) at "Halloween Hell" at Schuetzen Park Ballroom in North Bergen, New Jersey. On November 17, they defeated PapaDon and Terra X at "Battle In Bayonne" and NC-17 at "South Philly Invasion: 3rd Anniversary Show" at the ECW Arena the following night. They lost to The Backseat Boyz at "Seasons Beatings" on December 8, 2000.
On February 2, 2001, the Christopher Street Connection lost to Da Hit Squad in a match for the JAPW Tag Team Championship. The next night at "The New Beginning", they lost to Skinhead Ivan and Judas Young at the ECW Arena. They also lost to The Moondogs 2000 (Moondog Wenzel and Jak Molsonn) at the first night of "March Madness" on March 23 and JAPW Tag Team Champions Da Hit Squad at "Proven" on April 21. At "The Upset" on May 18, the team lost to Lo Ki in a handicap match. Returning to the ECW Arena, they lost to The Moondogs 2000 at "The Meltdown" the next day. The team hosted an interview segment, "Out of the Closet", at "Royal Consequences" two months later.
On November 9, they faced their former trainer Liathon in a handicap match. Chris Cabana was also joined in the match but ended up being pinned by Laithon after a Northern Lights suplex. They lost two more handicap matches to Laithon at "Halloween Hell" and "November Pain". At the 2-day "Seasons Beatings" supercard, they lost to Da Hit Squad but defeated the Rednecks From Hell (Big Jay and Matt Lariat) the second night.
Ring of Honor (2002-2003).
On February 22, 2002, the Christopher Street Connection made their Ring of Honor debut at the promotion's first show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They appeared in the opening match against Da Hit Squad and, after Mendoza was pinned by Mafia, Da Hit Squad attacked Allison Danger by putting her though a table. They made their second appearance in ROH at "A Night of Appreciation" losing to Da Hit Squad once again in a three-way match with Prince Nana and female wrestler Simply Luscious.
The two would continue to appear in JAPW at various times throughout the year. On May 3, the Christopher Street Connection lost to the Shaolin Wrecking Crew (Suba and Magic) when Magic pinned Chris Cabana despite not being officially in the match. Cabana, who was at ringside, had attempted to interfere in the match but was pinned costing them the match. On July 13, they defeated Eddie Thomas and Tony Lazaro in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. As well as being one of Alison Danger's earliest appearances with the group, it was the return match for Eddie Thomas since being injured in a car accident earlier that year.
Later that year in ROH, they would also face the Badstreet Boys (Joey Matthews and Christian York), The Carnage Crew (Loc and Devito) and Da Hit Squad. On December 28 at "Final Battle '02", Mendoza and The Japanese Pool Boy teamed as the New Christopher Street Connection. Facing The Carnage Crew at the Murphy Rec Center in Philadelphia, they were awarded the match via disqualification when their opponents attacked them with hubcaps.
During most of 2003, they would feud with The Carnage Crew in Ring of Honor. At ROH's "First Anniversary Show" at the Elks Lodge in Queens, New York, the Christopher Street Connection interfered in a match between The Carnage Crew and Texas Wrestling Academy students Hotstuff Hernandez, Don Juan and Fast Eddie. Rudy Boy Gonzalez, the school's head instructor, was at ringside. On March 22, Mace Mendoza teamed with Hotstuff Hernandez at "Night of Champions" losing to The Carnage Crew in Philadelphia when Mendoza was pinned by a second rope spike piledriver. On June 14, the Christopher Street Connection lost to The Carnage Crew at "Night of Grudges" in a grudge match.

On February 8, 2004, the Christopher Street Connection appeared at an interpromotional card between Pro Wrestling WORLD-1 and Wrestling Spotlight to raise money for the Christopher James "We Can Beat It" Cancer Fund. Held at the Cultural Center in Fall River, Massachusetts, they and Jason The Legend wrestled The Solution and Guillotine LeGrande in a 6-man tag team match.
On April 8, the Christopher Street Connection faced Josh Daniels and Matt Striker in a match to decide the first Pro Wrestling WORLD-1 Tag Team Champions in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. The two teams fought to a double-countout however, and the titles remained vacant. The next night, the Christopher Street Connection faced Simon Diamond and Justin Credible at a show for Pro Wrestling WORLD-1 at the Solanco Fairgrounds in Quarryville, Pennsylvania. Two months later, they wrestled Los Lunatics (Eddie Guapo and Low Ryda) at the Amazura Concert Hall for Jac Sabboth's ICW promotion. This was the first ICW event held in three years. On May 22, a match involving themselves, Special K (Izzy and Dixie) and The Ring Crew Express ended in a no-contest when Generation Next (Alex Shelley, Austin Aries, Jack Evans and Roderick Strong) broke up the match attacking all three teams.
While in USA Pro Wrestling the next year, they defeated Simon Diamond and Matt Striker to win the promotion's tag team titles on June 19, 2004. They also made a brief return to Ring of Honor at "Do or Die III" where they lost to Colt Cabana in a handicap match on July 17. Defending their titles against Matt Striker and M-Tizzle on September 17, they later appeared on a USA Pro show two months later in a same-sex wedding. The wedding was interrupted however when Matt Striker, serving as Buff E's best man, objected during the ceremony with Buff E admitting an affair between the two of them. Mendoza also confessed that he too was guilty of an affair with their valet Dana Dameson, who was also Mendoza's maid of honor, and it was revealed that she was pregnant by him. The Hard Line stable (Simon Diamond, John Shane, Mike Tobin and The Solution) came out to the ring, however the two made up and later wrestled in the main event against The Solution (Havok and Papadon) and lost the titles to them. On December 10, 2004, they defeated The Solution for the JAPW Tag Team Championship at "JAPW Seasons Beatings '04" in Rahway, New Jersey.
The Christopher Street Connection held the titles for over a month before losing to the Strong Style Thugs (B-Boy and Homicide) at "JAPW Wildcard" on January 28, 2005. On February 19, they defeated The Heartbreak Express (Sean and Phil Davis) at an ROH show. Appearing at the former ECW Arena, Buff E and Mace Mendoza also faced The Carnage Crew at an event celebrating JAPW's 100th wrestling show on March 26. The team also made appearances in United States Xtreme Wrestling and Jersey All Pro Wrestling during the next few months losing matches to The Carnage Crew and Billy Reil and Mike Tobin.
On May 21, the Christopher Street Connection appeared at the first "Chris Candido Memorial Show" hosted by UXW in Long Island, New York. They participated in a battle royal which included a number of former Extreme Championship Wrestling stars and other leading independent wrestlers including Bison Bravado, Danny Demanto, Jimmy Hustler, Eddie Guapo, Blade Michaels, Brolly, Mike Campbell, Ken Sweeney, New Dynamite Kid, Ron Sampson, Tony Lo, Heavy Metal, The Equalizer, Tony Devito, Johnny Candido, Balls Mahoney and Alere Little Feather among others. They also lost to The Masked Maniac and Shark Boy during the show.
Later during the event, the Christopher Street Connection confronted Billy Gunn following his win over Justin Credible. Upset at his WWF storyline with Chuck Palumblo, they attempted to attack him in the ring but were fought off by Gunn. They then accepted a challenge from Gunn to a tag team match in Queens, New York on September 24 where, in a reunion with longtime tag team partner "Road Dog" Jesse James, they faced and lost to the New Age Outlaws during the year.
Making appearances for UXW during the first half of 2006, the Christopher Street Connection lost to The Outcast Killahs (Oman Tortuga and Diablo Santiago) on February 3. Several months later at the second annual "Chris Candido Memorial Show", they wrestled two matches in one night defeated Wacky Wayne and Ron Sampson in the first match before losing to Monsta Mack and Havok later in the evening. At an October 28 event for JAPW, they did manage to score a victory over Beef Wellington and SeXXXy Eddy.

Inherently funny word

An inherently funny word is a word which can be found amusing without any given context, for reasons ranging from onomatopoeia to phonosemantics. Such words have been used by a range of influential comedians to enhance the humor of their routines.
It is part of the mythology of actors and writers that the consonant plosives (so called because they start suddenly or "explosively") "p, b, t, d, k", and "g" are the funniest sounds in the English language.
Funny nonsense words.
Words may be invented to sound funny. Instances include many works by Dr. Seuss; "Goon Show" scripts, which often included funny nonsense words, such as "ploogie", "plinge", "lurgy (lurgi)", "ying-tong-iddle-i-poh" and "needle-nardle-noo"; and the Knights who say Ni scene from the film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".
Cultural variation.
The concept of inherent humor appears to be heavily dependent on culture. Yiddish and German words, for example, are a staple of humor in American English, in particular those that begin with the ("sh") sound, spelled "sch-" (or sometimes "sh-" in Yiddish). Take for example the derisive prefix "shm-" or "schm-", as in "Oedipus schmoedipus!" - the trick known as shm-reduplication. 
Funny numbers.
According to Douglas Adams, the idea that the answer to "the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything" in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is 42 is funny because it is an "ordinary, smallish" number.
In the 1996 video "Caesar's Writers", former writers for Sid Caesar's "Your Show of Shows" discuss a skit in which Imogene Coca places a bet on a roulette wheel. The writers tried out several numbers before deciding "thirty-two" was the funniest number Coca could say. Neil Simon, one of the writers, went on to write "Laughter on the 23rd Floor", based on his experiences writing for Caesar. He claimed the "23" in the play's title was a transposition of "32". Carl Reiner created the Dick Van Dyke Show based on his experiences as a writer for "Your Show of Shows". In a first season episode, "The Curious Thing About Women", Morey Amsterdam's character, Buddy, explains that a package in a comedy skit they are writing should contain 32 pounds of hair, rather than 15, because "32 has always been a funnier number. I hear 32, I get hysterical!"
Comedian and singer-songwriter "Weird Al" Yankovic uses the number 27 prominently in his parody songs and videos because, according to him, "twenty-seven is a funny number".
In the comedy series "How I Met Your Mother", the character Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) uses the number 83 in his made-up statistics, because he believes the number is funny. 
Bob Barker frequently used two-digit prime numbers as a running gag in his discussion of the Range Game on "The Price Is Right", stating that if the contestant stopped the game too early, they could not start it again for another (23, 37, 43) hours. He also used numbers for humorous effect in the Money Game, referring to any number under 10 in that game as "El Cheapo", as the producers would often hide the winning piece behind the lowest numbers. 
On the DVD commentary for the British sitcom "I'm Alan Partridge", its writers put forward their own theory of funny numbers, going against the more common view that smaller, specific numbers are funny and instead employing large, round numbers (e.g. "a million pounds"). Steve Coogan, creator and star of the sitcom, said in an interview: "... like the number 37. Everyone uses that as a funny number. It's used quite a lot as a random comedy number, like 'that's the 37th time this has happened.' People should use random numbers more. Like 'fifty.' Alan Partridge's assistant is fifty. That was her age. And it sounded funny; I would say, 'this is my assistant Lynn, fifty.' "

The NSA sponsors regional workshops, youth and family events, education seminars for speech-language pathologists, and an Annual Conference, which hosts an average of 800 attendees. The NSA also publishes educational resources, such as pamphlets and booklets about stuttering, as well as two newsletters: "Letting Go" (for adults) and "Family Voices" (for children, teens, and parents). The NSA sponsors a monthly radio show about the effect of stuttering on guests' lives as well as a biweekly Google+ Hangout for teens who stutter.
In November 2002, in the year of the NSA's 25th anniversary, the Association received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.
The NSA played a key role in establishing the National Stuttering Awareness Week in 1988.
Annual Conference.
The NSA hosts a conference in the summer every year in the first week of July in cities throughout the United States. These cities included Scottsdale, AZ in 2010, Fort Worth, TX in 2011, and St. Petersburg, FL in 2012, again in Scottsdale in 2013. In the next three years, the conference will be in Washington D.C. in 2014, Chicago in 2015, and California in 2016. The 2016 conference will be a joint-conference with the International Stuttering Association. The conference begins with a two day research symposium with presentations and workshops by experts in the field, which is then followed by a five day general conference which features workshops led by the experts and by volunteers, as well as a keynote. The keynote was presented in 2011 by David Seidler, screenwriter of The King's Speech and in 2013 by Trumaine McBride, a cornerback in the National Football League.

1981–82 Quebec Nordiques season

The 1981–82 Quebec Nordiques season was the Nordiques' third season in the National Hockey League. The Nordiques would have a successful regular season, qualifying for the playoffs, but had a better playoff, making it to the Wales Final before losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders.
Off-season.
During the off-season, the four divisions of the NHL were re-aligned to better reflect the geographical locations of the teams. Quebec remained in the Adams Division with the Boston Bruins and Buffalo Sabres, while the Minnesota North Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs were replaced with the Hartford Whalers and the Nordiques' provincial rival, the Montreal Canadiens. The Nordiques signed Marian Stastny out of Czechoslovakia, the brother of Peter Stastny and Anton Stastny. Quebec replaced team captain Marc Tardif with Robbie Ftorek prior to the season. Ftorek would not remain the Nordiques captain for long, as he was traded to the New York Rangers in December, and was replaced with Andre Dupont.
Regular season.
The Nordiques would find themselves under .500 only once throughout the season, and that was five games in when they had a record of 2-3-0. Quebec would get hot, and eventually reached a season-high nine games over .500 in the middle of January, however, a late season slump had the Nords finish the year only two games above .500, with a 33-31-16 record, earning 82 points, which was good enough to finish fourth in the Adams Division, and the Nordiques second post-season appearance in a row.
Offensively, the Nordiques were led by Peter Stastny, who set a team record with 139 points, as he scored 46 goals and earned 93 assists. Stastny finished behind only Wayne Gretzky of the Edmonton Oilers and Mike Bossy of the New York Islanders in the NHL scoring race. Real Cloutier rebounded from an injury plagued 1980–81 season by scoring 37 goals and 97 points, while rookie Marian Stastny scored 35 goals and 89 points. Michel Goulet notched 42 goals and 84 points, while Dale Hunter had a breakout season, scoring 22 goals and 72 points, as well as a team record 272 penalty minutes. On defense, Mario Marois led the way, scoring 11 goals and 43 points.
In goal, Dan Bouchard held on to the number one job, winning a team record 27 games, while posting a team best 3.86 GAA, as well as earning a shutout in 60 games.
Playoffs.
The Nordiques opened the 1982 Stanley Cup Playoffs with a best of five Adams Division quarter-final series with their Battle of Quebec rivals, the Montreal Canadiens. Montreal finished the season on top of the Adams Division with a 46-17-17 record, earning 109 points, which was 27 more than the Nordiques.
The series opened with two games at the Montreal Forum, and the Canadiens handled the Nordiques easily in the first game, as Mario Tremblay and Mark Napier each scored twice for Montreal, leading them to a 5-1 victory. The Nordiques fought back in the second game, as goaltender Dan Bouchard made 33 saves as Quebec defeated Montreal 3-2 to even the series up. The series shifted to Le Colisee for the next two games, and in the third game of the series, the Nordiques were led by Dale Hunter and his two goals late in the first period, as well as another spectacular goaltending performance by Dan Bouchard, who made 22 saves, as the Nordiques edged the Canadiens 2-1 to take the series lead. Montreal fought back in the fourth game, which featured a brawl in which every player from both teams was involved. The brawl lasted for twenty minutes. There were 149 penalty minutes, and two game misconducts. The Canadiens easily defeated the underdog Nordiques 6-2 to even the series up at two games each, with the fifth and deciding game back at the Montreal Forum. In the fifth game, the Nordiques took an early 2-0 lead with first period goals by Wilf Paiement and Anton Stastny, however, the Canadiens tied the game in the third period, setting up overtime. In the extra period, Dale Hunter emerged as the hero, scoring 22 seconds into the period against Montreal goalie Rick Wamsley to clinch the series for the Nordiques, who then moved on to the Adams Division finals.
Quebec would face the Boston Bruins in the best of seven Adams Division finals. Boston had a 43-27-10 record, earning 96 points, and a second place finish in the division. The Bruins defeated the Buffalo Sabres in four games in their first playoff round. The series opened with two games at the Boston Garden. In the first game, the Nordiques and Bruins were tied up at three heading into the final minute of the third period, however, Ray Bourque scored for Boston, as the Bruins won the game 4-3. In the second game, the Bruins easily defeated Quebec by a score of 8-4, taking a commanding 2-0 series lead. The series moved to Le Colisee for the next two games, and the Nordiques responded on their home ice, as Wilf Paiement scored the overtime winner in the third game for a 3-2 Quebec victory, cutting the Bruins series lead to 2-1. In the fourth game, the Nordiques, led by Michel Goulet and his two goals, as well as 33 saves by goaltender John Garrett, easily defeated the Bruins 7-2 to even up the series. The fifth game was back in Boston, however, the Nordiques, led by Peter Stastny and his two goals, shocked the Bruins with a 4-3 win to push Boston on the brink of elimination. In the sixth game back in Quebec City, the Bruins stormed out to an early 3-0 lead, however, the Nordiques fought back, and tied the game at five in the third period, setting up overtime. In overtime, the Bruins Peter McNab scored, as the Bruins tied the series, setting up a seventh and deciding game back in Boston. After a scoreless first period, the Nordiques Michel Goulet opened the scoring in the second period, however, Peter McNab of the Bruins tied the game. In the third period, Nordiques defenseman Dave Pichette scored on the powerplay, giving Quebec a 2-1 lead. The Bruins couldn't beat Nordiques goaltender Dan Bouchard, who made 28 saves in the game, as the Nordiques held on for the 2-1 win, and completing the series upset, advancing to the Wales Conference finals.
The Nordiques opponent in the Wales Conference finals was the two time defending Stanley Cup champions, the New York Islanders. The best of seven series opened with two games at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Long Island, New York. The powerful Islanders, led by 27 saves by goaltender Billy Smith, defeated Quebec 4-1 in the series opener. In the second game, the Islanders were led by two goals by Mike Bossy, and another solid performance by Billy Smith, who made 35 saves, as New York defeated Quebec 5-2 to take a 2-0 series lead. In the third game back in Quebec, the Nordiques took the Islanders to overtime, however, New York's Wayne Merrick emerged the hero, as he scored late in the first overtime, giving the Islanders a 5-4 victory, and 3-0 series lead. New York completed the series sweep in the fourth game, as the Islanders took a 3-0 lead late into the third period. Quebec put up a fight, scoring twice to cut the Islanders lead to 3-2, however, Duane Sutter scored an empty net goal to give the Islanders a 4-2 victory.

Chris Ward (footballer)

Chris Ward (born 28 April 1981) is an English footballer. He plays as an attacking midfielder for Lancaster City having played in the Football league for Lincoln City.
Early career.
Hailing from the Preston suburb of Ashton-on-Ribble, Ward began his career with local sides Springfields and Fulwood Amateurs whilst studying at Ashton-on-Ribble High School and Preston College before signing for Lancaster City at the age of 18. Ward quickly made an impression at Lancaster, scoring on his full debut in the 2–0 away victory over Winsford United on 24 August 1999. A deluge of goals for Lancaster attracted the attention of scouts and on 24 April 2001 Ward agreed to join Birmingham City for £25,000; his contract would officially begin at the start of the 2001–02 season.
Ward failed to make the first team at Birmingham and in October 2001 he joined Forest Green on a months loan, making his debut in the 2–2 home draw with Northwich Victoria on 29 September 2001 and scoring his first, and only, league goal for the club a week later in the 5–1 away defeat to Doncaster Rovers. In March 2002 he joined Southport, again on loan, debuting in the 3–2 home defeat to Boston United on 1 April 2002.
Released by Birmingham at the end of the season, he joined Barrow, making his debut in the 1–1 home draw with Hucknall Town on 17 August 2002 and scoring his first league goal for the club in the 1–1 away draw with Runcorn on the following Tuesday. Ward's time with Barrow would be brief as after just a month with the club he signed for Leigh R.M.I.. After making his debut in the 1–0 away defeat to Farnborough Town on 21 September 2002, Ward notched his only league goal for Leigh in the 2–1 home victory over Stevenage Borough on 12 October.
Lincoln City.
In October 2002, Ward returned to the Football league signing for Lincoln City where he linked up with sometime Lancaster City team-mate Mark Bailey. He made his Football League debut for the club as a 74th minute replacement for Adie Mike in the 0–0 draw at Darlington on 2 November 2002 and scored his first goal for the club on his full league debut against Carlisle United on 4 February 2003, but he struggled to establish himself at Sincil Bank and was released at the end of the season.
Return to the non-leagues.
He linked up with Northwich Victoria then Bamber Bridge. Moves to Kendal Town and Mossley followed. He moved on to Clitheroe, scoring on his debut in the 3–1 home defeat to Bradford Park Avenue on 6 January 2007. Teaching commitments caused Ward to miss most of the 2007–08 season but he resumed his Clitheroe career at the start of the 2008–09 season. In November 2008, Ward linked up with his one-time Lancaster City manager Tony Hesketh at Chorley, debuting in the 3–1 away defeat to F.C. Halifax Town on 15 November 2008. Hesketh departed the hot seat at Chorley to return to Lancaster City and Ward was one of five players who followed him from Chorley to the Giant Axe based club ahead of the 2009–10 season. He marked his return to the club by scoring on his debut in the 5–0 home Northern Premier League Division One North victory over Prescot Cables on 15 August 2009.

Jewish Internet Defense Force

The Jewish Internet Defense Force (JIDF) is an organization that uses social media to mobilize support for campaigns against websites and Facebook groups that promote or praise what it regards as Islamic terrorism or antisemitism. The group's website describes the JIDF as a "private, independent, non-violent protest organization representing a collective of activists". The JIDF's work has been termed "hacktivism" by some media outlets.
Organization and methods.
According to the JIDF, the organization "formed as a grassroots effort in 2000, to mount mass e-mail campaigns, in response to the outbreak of the Second Intifada." The organization was founded by a person who identifies himself as "David Appletree." According to a reporter from "The Jewish Week" in 2009 he "will not say if that is his true surname." In the same article Appletree claimed that Facebook administrators closed his account because "they don’t like my views." A Facebook spokesperson replied that the account was terminated because the website did not believe he was using his real name, which is a breach of Facebook's "real name culture". Appletree went on to state that he was being targeted while Facebook turns a blind eye to other users who fail to comply with this rule, and that he maintains approximately 40 Facebook groups focused on combating terrorism and antisemitism.
The group says they "specifically target hateful material or material which blatantly promotes hatred or violence, no matter where it can be found." The "About" page of the website says "We believe in direct action both to eradicate the problems we face online and to create the publicity that will cause those with companies like Facebook and Google to take the needed action themselves." The group focuses its attention on websites like Facebook, YouTube, Google Earth, and Wikipedia. The JIDF has redirected anti-Israel Facebook groups to other pages it prefers and changed the names of Muslim members of such groups to "Mossad collaborator," among other actions. A website spokesman told Haaretz that they don't break any laws and that the JIDF "prefers the terms 'seize control,' 'take over' or 'infiltrate' to 'hack.'"
In another article, Appletree maintained, "The main reason the JIDF exists is to promote Israel and fight Jew hatred as well as Islamic terrorist trends online," and stated, "we are a grassroots organization that reaches the hearts and the minds of normal, everyday Jews and Israel supporters who haven't been bamboozled into supporting the Jewish establishment that has completely failed Israel and the Jewish people in every way imaginable."
On Facebook.
During 2007, a controversy on Facebook was reported involving "the drop-down list of places members can use to show where they live." A Facebook group, "Palestine Is not a country ... Delist it from Facebook as a country!", had been formed in 2007 which petitioned Facebook management to remove Palestine from Facebook's list of countries. Several Facebook groups formed to support or oppose this removal including "Israel is not a country!
Delist it from Facebook as a country". Matt Hicks of Facebook responded by saying: "As long as the groups meet our terms of use, they can stay up. But we encourage users to report anything that is racist or objectionable. The JIDF claimed the "Israel is not a Country" group was antisemitic and mobilized supporters to complain to Facebook in an effort to have it deleted. After Facebook refused to shut the group down, the JIDF said it somehow took control of the group in July 2008. , two groups with the same names were active on Facebook.
According to a November 2008 article in "Haaretz", the JIDF forwarded lists of Facebook groups that it deemed promoted hatred or violence to the website's administrators, hoping they would be removed. According to a man named "David" quoted in the Haaretz article, Facebook either did nothing or waited months before taking action. "David" told Haaretz that his group then decided to try to technically "intercept Facebook groups and make them impossible to access." The JIDF was particularly upset about Facebook groups praising the shooting of students at Jerusalem's Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva in March 2008.
In July 2009, the JIDF and Avi Dichter took credit for successfully pressuring Facebook into removing a fan page for Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The JIDF said it mobilized supporters to complain about the page to Facebook's owners. The JIDF website claims that it deleted the vast majority of a pro-Hezbollah fan page's 118,000 members. The JIDF sites says it has removed more than 100 antisemitic groups from Facebook. The JIDF said in September 2009 that it took over the Facebook group "Eliminate Israel from Being" and deleted more than 5,000 members before Facebook management "returned control of the site to its administrators."
The JIDF has criticized Facebook for allegedly condoning and hosting Holocaust denial groups on its network. The group has charged that it's hypocritical of Facebook to remove groups that support the KKK, for instance, while not removing what it considers Holocaust denial sites and has vowed to keep putting pressure on Facebook over the matter.
Elsewhere on the Web.
JIDF's measures "include reporting Wikipedia editors it claims are anti-Israel, and taking action against entries seen as including one-sided or false accounts of the history of Israel and the Mideast conflict," Haaretz wrote. The group has sought to have Palestinian villages listed as having been destroyed during the foundation of Israel removed from Google Earth and has campaigned against the description of "Palestine" as a country.
The JIDF organized a pro-Gilad Shalit campaign in 2009 on the social networking site Twitter. During the Tweet4Shalit campaign Twitter users drove the Gilad Shalit name to the second highest trend on the day of his 23rd birthday. Tweets for Shalit ranged from the demand to "Free Shalit" to requests for international supervision of the case.
The JIDF was recognized by the JTA as one of the "100 Most Influential Jewish Twitterers" and was ranked as the top-ranked Jewish Newswire.
Criticism.
In October 2008, the German newspaper the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ)" wrote that "the JIDF follows an open political agenda as well. Many of its members protested the clearing of Israeli settlements in the Gaza strip in 2005 – they regard this policy of trading Land for Peace as wrong." The newspaper wrote that that "Ultimately the JIDF also wants to propagate ‘Jewish values on the Internet’. This leads to the self-appointed warriors against online-hatred to link their own homepage to a dubious site named ‘thereligionofpeace.com’. The JIDF website itself says "Mohammed was a genocidal pedophile who murdered people who didn't think like he did, or believe the things he believed. Millions of Muslims promote the idea that if we "insult" him (despite the fact that he's dead), that we should be killed." The website says that Mohammad was a "false prophet" and that the "Islamic ideology itself is clearly one of hatred and violence, which is declaring war against the entire non-Islamic world... it is determined to dominate the world, just as Nazism was." The website came out against plans to build an Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero in New York, and said this was the reason why. "Because Islam is a hateful and violent ideology which preaches hate and violence against ALL non-Muslims (especially Jews, as it is obsessed with us, and dehumanizes us as apes and pigs), we are against ALL mosques. We are against Islam, just as we are against Nazism. Just as we don't wish to see Nazi institutions springing up everywhere, we don't need to see Islamic one's springing up everywhere, either."
In May 2009, CNN wrote that the JIDF is "sometimes guilty of sweeping generalizations of its own", citing an 2008 interview published on Facebook critic Brian Cuban's site in which a JIDF representative discussed "the issues surrounding Barack Obama's terrorist connections as well as his racist and anti-Semitic church, which has supported Hamas and the Rev. Louis Farrakhan", and the reply when asked how the Jewish and Muslim communities saw the JIDF, that "99.9% of Muslims hate us".
CNN quoted a JIDF spokesperson as saying he would rather people not focus on those specific quotations as the interview had been "informal" and Cuban "would not let us correct any of our statements after we quickly answered him to help him meet his deadline."
Asked in the Cuban interview "What is the position of the JIDF on the “Palestinian Question” regarding disputes over occupied lands" the spokesman replied: "Palestinians should be transferred out of Israeli territories. They can live in any of the other many Arab states. We are against all land concessions to our enemies. We are against the release of terrorist prisoners from Israeli prisons. We are against the arming and funding of our enemies and the negotiation with them. We are for morals, ethics and common sense and feel Israel must truly act as a “light unto the nations” in order for the world to be safe as we feel Israel is truly on the front lines in the war in which Islam has declared upon us."

Strensham services

Strensham services is a motorway service station on the M5 in Worcestershire, England. In August 2011, it was rated as 4 stars (southbound) and 3 stars (northbound) by quality assessors at Visit England.
Unusually for a motorway service station, the two sites are about half a mile apart due to the proximity of junction 8 (for the M50 motorway). The services opened with the motorway in 1962 and have undergone many developments over time, largely due to the evolution of the motorway, which at the time of its opening ran from Birmingham to Strensham but now runs to Exeter some 100 miles southwards. It was the first service station on the M5.
History.
The original service station opened with the M5 and M50 motorways in November 1962, though none of the original buildings survive in use. The M5, which was built with dual two-lane carriageways, was extended southwards, from junction 8 in 1969, with dual three-lane carriageways. It was widened between junctions 3 and 8 to dual three-lane carriageways in the early 1990s including a remodelling of junction 8 (M50). The proximity of the northbound area to the remodelled junction would have caused issues with traffic trying to join and leave the motorway and so it was relocated half a mile to the north on a new larger site in 1991. The exit from the southbound services has been altered to feed directly into the M50 junction. The former northbound area is now in use as a maintenance area, though due to the motorway widening this can now only be accessed from the local road network.
Wychavon District Council refused to renew the gambling machine permit for the service area in 1994, under its policy not to allow gambling machines in areas where food was sold to the public. The Kenning Motor Group, who operated the service area at the time went to the High Court to overturn the decision.
In 1994 the service area was subject to a management buyout, led by Nick Turner, who had been running the site for the previous three years. It was announced the services would trade under the new name, Take a Break. At the time RoadChef unsuccessfully showed interest in purchasing the site, it wasn't until 2001, by purchasing Take A Break that RoadChef started operating at the Strensham site.
Strensham was one of two test sites chosen by RoadChef for a new loyalty card scheme in 2005. The cards themselves used new technology to physically display the points total on the card. The loyalty scheme is no longer in use today.
In July 2008 RoadChef started a trial at the southbound site by replacing the Wimpy fast food franchise with a McDonalds outlet, previously only four UK motorway service areas had McDonalds franchises. If this trial was deemed to be successful, RoadChef plan to replace more Wimpy franchises. As part of this trial signs for the southbound area were changed to show the operator name as "McDonalds Costa", although the RoadChef brand is still used at the services itself. The refurbishment created around 80 jobs in the local area.
Since the Southbound refurbishment, all Wimpy outlets have closed to be replaced by own brand The Burger Company. It is thought that this is just a 'holding' brand prior to a full-scale refurbishment. Due to the success of the trial Roadchef have refurbished more sites (including Strensham Northbound) to include The Hot Food Company (Restaurant) and McDonald's.
Notable events.
2007 Worcestershire Flooding.
As a consequence of heavy rainfall in Worcestershire in July 2007 the M5 motorway was blocked, leaving many stranded cars on the road. The operations manager of the service station, Quintin Speers provided a key role in helping those stranded, opening up areas of the main building to be used by those stuck on the motorway. Quintin Speers also helped drivers by pushing cars to safety and distributing blankets to those in need.
Present day.
Southbound services.
The southbound site is in its original location, though none of the original buildings survive. The main building is a large glass-fronted structure with the main car park situated in front of the building, with the lorry and coach parking behind.
In May 2005 it was reported that the southbound services had overnight parking facilities for 60 lorries. This was a chargeable service.
Northbound services.
Situated half a mile to the north of the southbound services, the northbound services are set back from the motorway. The main building is an unusual design based on curves and circles. Unlike the southbound site, the cash machines are located outside and both the car and lorry parking is to the front of the building.
Access to an air ambulance base is at the rear of the site. The site also has a budget-chain hotel located within the service area. In May 2005 it was reported that the southbound services had overnight parking facilities for 100 lorries. This was a chargeable service.
Facilities.
The following facilities are available at Strensham:
Location.
Strensham services are located slightly to the north of M5 junction 8, the exit slip road from the southbound area merges into the slip road from the M5 to junction 8, so traffic must negotiate junction 8 to rejoin the M5. Northbound the service area is about a mile north of the junction.
The services are located about south of Worcester, and about north of Gloucester. They are also about to the north west of London.

Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy

The Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) (sometimes referred to as the Finnish Initiative) is a multilateral, non-binding agreement among Arctic states aimed at Arctic environment protection. Discussions began in 1989, with the AEPS adopted in June 1991 by Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the USSR, and the United States. The AEPS deals with monitoring, assessment, protection, emergency preparedness/response, and conservation of the Arctic zone. It has been called a major political accomplishment of the post-Cold War-era.
Background.
In January 1989, Finland sent a letter to the other Arctic states proposing a conference on protection of the Arctic environment. The Rovaniemi Meeting of September 1989 established two working groups. This was followed by the second consultative meeting in Yellowknife, Canada in April 1990 where a third "ad hoc" group was established to develop the strategy. It also resulted in the preparation of a draft document. Kiruna, Sweden was the site of the third meeting, held in January 1991, where one group worked on the drafting the AEPS while another dealt with specific environmental issues.
Adoption.
Government officials from all the Arctic nations convened in Rovaniemi in June 1991 for the last consultative meeting. The first three days included meetings, followed by a ministerial-level meeting on 13–14 June observed by representatives from Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations. 
Three indigenous peoples' organizations observed, participated, and became Permanent Participants: the Saami Council, the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, and the Association of Indigenous Minorities of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation. They considered the Rovaniemi ministerial meeting to be "historic" as it represented the first time that Arctic indigenous peoples participated in an international declaration's preparation process.
On 14 June 1991, the AEPS and the Declaration on the Protection of the Arctic Environment ("Rovaniemi Declaration") were formally adopted. The main objectives were listed as,
"Preserving environmental quality and natural resources, accommodating environmental protection principals with the needs and traditions of Arctic Native peoples, monitoring environmental conditions, and reducing and eventually eliminating pollution in the Arctic Environment."
Follow-up.
The AEPS outlined five objectives and six pollution issues. Legal issues included its jurisdictional reach and extent of obligations for the member states. Data-gathering, information compilation, and assessment tasks were organized around these issues.
In their 1993 follow-up meeting in Nuuk, Greenland, ministers endorsed expanding the AEPS in order to deal with sustainable development, and issued the Nuuk Declaration. Another meeting occurred in 1996 in Inuvik, Canada, resulting in the Inuvik Declaration, and the establishment of the Arctic Council. The last meeting, held in 1997 in Alta, Norway following the AEPS's 1996 absorption into the Arctic Council resulted in the Alta Declaration.
The AEPS remains a strategy for the Council's working groups, including:

David Kirkpatrick (producer)

David Paul Kirkpatrick (born 29 June 1951) an American film producer, studio executive and writer. He is perhaps most famous for his career at Paramount Pictures where he started as a story editor, oversaw the studio's exclusive development deal with Eddie Murphy and eventually became President of the Motion Picture Group. Kirkpatrick was also the first motion picture executive to be chief of production at two studios at the same time when he ran Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Pictures. He is the Co-Founder of the MIT Center For Future Storytelling, dedicated to elevating the human experience through technology and art. He is currently working in a not-for-profit dedicated to Christian worldview education.
Biography.
Kirkpatrick graduated from Hudson High School in Hudson Ohio in 1969.
Paramount.
Kirkpatrick sold his first screenplay to Paramount at the age of 17 while still in high school and was teaching screenwriting at California Institute of the Arts at the age of 18 where he received his bachelor's degree in 1974. Kirkpatrick's screenplay "Dynamite Woman" was produced in 1976 and distributed by New World Pictures. Shortly after, he took a position in the story department at Paramount Pictures. Kirkpatrick worked his way up the ranks at Paramount making his name by overseeing Paramount's exclusive development deal with Eddie Murphy. The arrangement was the most successful of its kind in over 50 years in Hollywood and created several huge hits including the $234 million blockbuster "Beverly Hills Cop", still the third highest grossing R-rated film of all time.
During his years at Paramount, Kirkpatrick oversaw the successful "Indiana Jones" and "Star Trek" franchises, box office hits like "Top Gun" (1986), "Ghost" (1990), and "The Hunt for Red October" (1990), and award winning films such as "Witness" (1985), "Terms of Endearment" (1983), and "Reds" (1981).
While at Paramount, David worked under legendary industry executives Barry Diller, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg. Both Kirkpatrick and Katzenberg were involved in the development of "Coming to America" (1988) and the subsequent Buchwald v. Paramount breach of contract lawsuit. The case is considered a watershed decision in reforming "Hollywood accounting" and net profit formulas and was chronicled in the 1992 book "Fatal Subtraction".
Kirkpatrick was also instrumental in replacing "Hunt for Red October" star Alec Baldwin with Harrison Ford in the Jack Ryan franchise. Baldwin revealed this in a March 2011 column on "The Huffington Post", in which he accused Kirkpatrick of back-handed dealings in the matter, referring to Kirkpatrick as "a beady-eyed, untalented tool".
Disney and Touchstone.
From 1987 to 1989, Kirkpatrick became the chief of production at Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Pictures becoming the first motion picture executive to hold that position at two studios at the same time. During that period, he oversaw "The Little Mermaid" (1989), "Pretty Woman" (1990) and "Dead Poets Society" (1989) among other films, before returning to Paramount.
Original Voices.
Kirkpatrick left his post at Paramount after an infamous encounter with fellow executive Stanley R. Jaffe that resulted in Kirkpatrick pulling into the lot one day to find his office furniture on the lawn. Afterward, he entered into a production deal with the company and then produced "The Brady Bunch Movie" (1995), and "The Evening Star" (1996), a sequel to "Terms of Endearment". He then formed his own production company Original Voices concentrating on smaller budget projects, producing the independent hits "Big Night" (1996) and "The Opposite of Sex" (1998), with Rysher Entertainment.
Good News Holdings.
In 2006, Kirkpatrick co-founded Good New Holdings, a faith-based entertainment company that produced "spiritainment". The company and Kirkpatrick were featured in a The New York Times profile, "A Once-Feared Kingmaker Called to a Different Battle" in December 2006. The title of the profile refers to the battle outlined in Ephesians 6:12 regarding the struggle over souls.
Plymouth Rock Studios.
After leaving Good News Holdings, Kirkpatrick co-founded Plymouth Rock Studios, a planned $500 million film and television studio that was scheduled to open in 2012 in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Other executives involved included Earl Lestz, former President of Paramount Studio Groups for 21 years, real estate developer Bill Wynne, who built Rancho Santa Margarita, and Joe DiLorenzo, former CFO of the Boston Celtics and current Chairman of the Financial Executives International organization. In November 2009, the Studio had announced that it had secured $500 million in financing. The financing eventually fell through. Kirkpatrick and Plymouth Rock Studios parted ways in June 2010.
Rock Organization.
Kirkpatrick took a position in 2011 with the Rock Organization. It is a Christian worldview foundation based in the Midwestern United States. He is working on a transmedia event on the life of Jesus Christ.
Awards.
David Kirkpatrick produced the 1996 HBO film "" that won the Golden Globe for Best Mini-Series of Motion Picture Made for Television. Alan Rickman won both the Emmy and the Golden Globe for his title performance role in the mini-series. Kirkpatrick also produced "The Opposite of Sex", which received the 1999 Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. In 2007, he became the first recipient of the "David Award" the lifetime achievement award from Regent University, a Christian college, for "redemptive work" in the entertainment field. The award derives its name from the David of the Old Testament.

Activated in 1952 as an intermediate command echelon of Strategic Air Command, the 810th Air Division assured the manning, training, and equipping of assigned units to conduct long range bombardment missions with its assigned B-50D Superfortress and B-36 Peacemaker strategic bombardment Wings using either nuclear or conventional weapons. With the phaseout of the B-36 in the late 1950s, the Division controlled B-47 Stratojet medium bomber wings.
In 1962 the organization was redesignated as a Strategic Aerospace Division after taking command of several intercontinental ballistic missile wings equipped with SM-65 Atlas and LGM-30A Minuteman I missiles and trained for strategic aerospace warfare.
Between 1966 and 1973, 810 AD subordinate organizations loaned KC-135 Stratotanker and B-52 Stratofortress aircraft and crews, at various times, to Strategic Air command organizations flying Arc Light combat missions in Southeast Asia. In the spring of 1968, some aircraft and crews deployed to Okinawa in response to the Pueblo Incident, when the USSS Pueblo, a United States Navy vessel, was seized on the high seas by the armed forces of the People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).
The 810th also participated in tactical exercises such as Club Car, Snow Bank, and Bar None. It was inactivated in 1971 as a result of budgetary reductions.

Hall XFH

The Hall XFH was an American fighter aircraft built by Hall Aluminum Company. It was the first fighter with a semimonocoque metal fuselage.
Development.
The XFH was designed in 1927 by Charles Hall. It was a single-bay biplane with N-struts for the fabric-covered wings. Its fuselage was made of steel tubing covered in a watertight aluminum skin, enabling it to float if ditched in the ocean. Also for ditching on water or on land, the landing gear could be jettisoned. Power was provided by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine. Testing in June 1929 showed poor handling characteristics and performance. During one test flight, the upper wing came off the plane. After repairs, the XFH made test flights from an aircraft carrier. Designated XFH by the Bureau of Aeronautics, it was purchased not for active service, but to study new metal construction techniques.

Brukkaros Mountain

Brukkaros Mountain is an extinct volcano in Karas Region, Namibia. Measuring 1,590 metres at its peak, Brukkaros is located about 15 kilometres northeast of the primarily Nama town of Berseba. It is over 600 metres taller than the surrounding area. 
The mountain is a large extinct volcano, in the form of a ring mountain (a so-called "tuff ring") with a diameter of about 4 km and has been formed by an explosion when rising magma met groundwater and superheated it. It is formed of an indistinctly bedded red-brown microbreccia, composed of finely fragmented rocks of the Nama System that were blown out of a volcanic vent about 80 million years ago. The breccia layers slope inwards (unlike the slope around a volcanic crater), and removal of the softer upper layers by erosion has created the central hollow. The hollow is drained by a stream which runs southwards through the ring mountain in a narrow valley. The route into the interior of the mountain is along this valley. At its head is a dry waterfall, over which the stream plunges down some 45 m after rain, and the river bed directly below the fall is the principal source of water. 
History.
From 1926-1931, the National Geographic Society, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution, ran the Brukkaros Solar Observatory on the mountain to measure daily solar radiation.

Native American self-determination

Native American self-determination refers to the social movements, legislation, and beliefs by which the tribes in the United States exercise self-governance and decision making on issues that affect their own people. "Self-determination" is meant to reverse the paternalistic policies enacted upon Native American tribes since the U.S. government created treaties and established the reservation system. The nations want to control their own affairs. Self-determination is the means by which a tribe implements its sovereign powers. The movement gained strength in the 1930s and since the 1960s, when American Indian activism gained important changes between the nations and the U.S. government. Tribes have established many new institutions, such as tribal colleges and universities, that help them preserve their cultures.
Origin of the concept of self-determination.
Self-determination is defined as the movement by which the Native Americans sought to achieve restoration of tribal community, self-government, cultural renewal, reservation development, educational control, and equal or controlling input into federal government decisions concerning policies and programs. The beginnings of the federal policy favoring self-determination dates back to the 1930s. In 1933, John Collier, a social worker and reformer who had long worked in American Indian affairs, was appointed commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was likely the most knowledgeable person about American Indians appointed to this position, and he respected tribal cultures and values. 
The U.S. Congress passed Collier's legislation, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, although with numerous changes. It was to enable tribes to reorganize their governments and strengthen their communities. It ended the allotment of Indian lands, which had led to loss of control over their territories. The law was intended to decrease the paternalistic power of the BIA, which extended to their running numerous boarding schools, where American Indian children were forced to give up native languages and cultural practices. Four years before the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, the government acknowledged that the paternalism was unfair to the Indian tribes and their people. The IRA was called the Indian "New Deal" by the Roosevelt administration. The IRA enabled the restoration of tribal governments, but Congress made many changes in response to lobbyists, and the bill fell short of the policy of "Indian self-determination without termination."
During the 1950s, government policy changed toward American Indians, and politicians recommended termination of many of the tribes' special relationships with the government under federal recognition of their status, in favor of assimilation. Over 100 tribes were terminated; those that continued suffered from increased governmental paternalism. During the 1960s and later, with increased activism for civil rights and American Indian rights, the movement for self-determination gained strength.
Self-determination: after 1960.
Self-determination was not official federal government policy until 1970, when Richard Nixon addressed the issue in his July 8 congressional "Message from the President of the United States Transmitting Recommendations for Indian Policy." His purpose was to indicate a change from the former policies on U.S.-Indian relations.
"It is long past time that the Indian policies of the Federal government began to recognize and build upon the capacities and insights of the Indian people. Both as a matter of Justice and as a matter of enlightened social policy, we must begin to act on the basis of what the Indians themselves have long been telling us. The time has come to break decisively with the past and to create the conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is determined by Indian acts and Indian decisions." 
Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. It enabled the government to make direct contracts with the Indian tribes just as it does with the states, for implementation of programs and distribution of funds. Rather than the BIA administering programs directly, the government would contract with tribes to manage health care, for instance, or educational benefits.
In 1968, Congress had passed the Indian Civil Rights Act, after recognizing the policies of Indian termination as a failure during the 1960s. American Indians had persisted in keeping their cultures and religions alive, and the government recognized that the goal of assimilation was the wrong one. The bill was to ensure provision of the Bill of Rights to the tribal peoples. In the following years, Congress passed additional legislation to carry out Nixon's programs to develop a stronger trust relationship between the federal government and the tribes, and to allow the tribes to manage their own affairs. 
Examples are the Indian Financing Act of 1974 and the Self-Determination and Education Act of 1975. The Indian Child Welfare Act "... recognized tribal courts as the primary and ultimate forum for welfare and custody cases concerning native children."By promising to look after the tribes' children, the ICWA contributed to the economic and cultural welfare of each tribe's future. The American Indian Religious Freedom Act "...recognized the integrity of native cultures." It ended the persecution of American Indians for such practices as the use of peyote in religion. 
Since 1980, administrations have issued Presidential Memoranda on Indian affairs to indicate direction for increased tribal sovereignty. A 1994 Presidential Memorandum issued by Bill Clinton changed the way the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development supported housing programs. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 consolidated grant programs for housing funding into a single block grant specifically available to recognized governments of American Indians and Alaska Natives.
Leaders of the self-determination movement.
A renewal of Indian activism since the 1960s saw the rise of a new generation of leaders. Public protests created publicity for their cause, such as the occupation of Alcatraz and Mount Rushmore, the Wounded Knee Incident, and other examples of American Indians uniting to change their relationship with the United States government. Strong Indian leaders traveled across America to try to add unification to the Indian cause. The leaders arose in different fields, starting independent newspapers, promoting educational independence, working to reclaim lands, and to enforce treaty rights. Another fight occurred in the Northwest as Billy Frank, Jr. and Hank Adams fought for treaty fishing rights. The result was a Native American force which fought for change throughout a wide variety of interconnected social spheres. In effect, each self-determined Native American was a small component of a larger machine, and this helped make the movement more successful.
Education.
Allan Yazzie.
Allan Yazzie was a Navajo tribal member who proposed the creation of a Native American-run school to be built on the tribe’s land in Arizona. The project was called the Rough Rock Demonstration School, and it was to administered solely by the Navajo Indians (without BIA oversight.) Although many politicians thought that the school would fail immediately, it prevailed and stood out as a sign of Indian self-determination and success. In 1968, the Navajo established the first tribal college, to be followed by similarly controlled tribal colleges on numerous reservations.
Land reclamation and anti-termination.
Paul Bernal.
Paul Bernal (also known as Sherry Beni) fought for the Taos Pueblo tribe of New Mexico who wanted to reclaim their religious refuge called Blue Lake. It had been taken by the Forest Service at the start of the twentieth century for inclusion in a national forest. Throughout the 1960s, Bernal and the Pueblo had little success in regaining the lake. The administration of Richard Nixon supported self-determination for American Indians. After Senate hearings (where Bernal was harassed by senators who thought that the Indians wanted the land for other than religious purposes), Nixon signed a bill to return the lake to the Taos Pueblo.
Ada Deer.
Ada Deer (b. 1935) is a leader of the Menominee tribe, which has a reservation in Wisconsin. In the 1960s, Deer helped mobilize her tribe to oppose the government's termination policies in relation to American Indian tribes, and ultimately succeeded. By 1972, Deer had gained support for her tribe’s movement, and many governors, senators, and congressman gave her and the Menominee tribe their full-fledged approval. Deer fought against the Interior Committee chairman (Wayne Aspinall), who supported the tribe’s termination, and their loss of of communal land under termination policies. Ada Deer continued to lobby for the Menominee Restoration Act. After Aspinall failed to win an election, the tribe prevailed and the act was signed President Nixon. Ada Deer (along with such people as Lucy Covington) is one of the early examples of self-determination in tribal members; her efforts helped restore all the terminated lands back to the Menominee tribe.
D'Arcy McNickle.
D'Arcy McNickle is a Cree and Salish-Kootenai member of the Flathead reservation. He served as the chair of a committee of Indian leaders at the 1961 American Indian Chicago Conference, and crafted an Indian policy called "Declaration of Indian purpose." The policy outlined many solutions to the problems of termination. It was a sign of change in the 1960s and 1970s when the termination era ended. The "Declaration of Indian purpose" was given to John F. Kennedy by the National Congress of American Indians. The tribal governments started to bypass the BIA and focus on self-determination plans.
Legal activism.
John Echohawk.
John Echohawk is a member of the Pawnee tribe, and a founder and leader of the Native American Rights Fund (NARF). He is a lawyer who has worked to protect Indian land and sovereignty. In 1970 Echohawk was the first Native American to graduate from the University of New Mexico's school of law. After law school, Echohawk became a part of California Indian Legal Services. Echohawk joined together with other lawyers and tribal members to form the NARF, which was similar to the NAACP (both were based around civil rights activism. Echohawk centered NARF's focus around preserving tribes, protecting tribal resources, protecting human rights, ensuring government responsibility, expanding Indian law and educating people about Indian issues. Through NARF, Echohawk has had a range of civil rights successes, from government recognition of tribal sovereignty to the drafting of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
Rosalind McClanahan.
A member of the Navajo tribe, Rosalind McClanahan opposed Arizona's imposing a state income tax on members of her tribe who lived and worked within the Navajo Reservation. McClanahan lived and worked in the reservation, and was taxed; she considered it an issue of tribal sovereignty. She enlisted the help of DNA (a group of Native American rights attorneys), and in 1973, the United States Supreme Court had begun working on the case. (The state court had decided in favor of Arizona, and the DNA lawyers had appealed). The resulting U.S. Supreme Court ruling was in favor of McClanahan. She helped establish stronger self-rule for the Navajos as well as other Native American tribes.
Organizations.
Several Native American organizations provided an immense amount of support that either helped set the precedent for the self-determination movement or further strengthen the policy. These organizations can be divided mainly into two levels: associations that were nationally operated and those groups that were organized for local action.
National.
In 1944, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was founded “in response to termination and assimilation policies that the United States forced upon the tribal governments in contradiction of their treaty rights and status as sovereigns. NCAI stressed the need for unity and cooperation among tribal governments for the protection of their treaty and sovereign rights". “Recognizing the threat posed by termination, fought to maintain Indians’ legal rights and cultural identity.” Indian policy has been federalized since colonial times; however, “until the 1940s, in spite of such major national initiatives as allotment and the Indian Reorganization Act, Indians had never been able to organize on a national basis". Groups such as the Friends of the Indians in the late nineteenth century and the Association on American Indian Affairs (est. 1922) had nearly all-white membership. The NCAI was an Indian-only organization with membership based on tribes, not individuals. Although the “NCAI’s fortunes would ebb and flow . . . the return of Indian veterans at the end of World War II” gave the organization and the Indian people an unexpected boost. “Whether they settled in Indian country or in the cities, these veterans realized expectations and bred a much-needed impatience and assertiveness.” According to Helen Peterson, later executive director of NCAI, “World War Two revived the Indians’ capacity to act on their own behalf.” With the NCAI, Native American people relied on their own people to organize and affect national policy. The NCAI was one of the first major steps in halting termination and giving life to the Self-Determination era.
The Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a result of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty legislation and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, provided grants and other funds directly to tribal governments rather than only state and federal agencies. The War on Poverty Grants “empowered tribes by building tribal capacities, creating independence from the BIA, and knitting tribes together with other tribes and the country as a whole.” As Philip S. Deloria explains, the OEO helped the Indian people become more independent and powerful: for the first time “. . . Indian tribal governments had money and were not beholden for it to the Bureau of Indian Affairs . . . Tribes could, to some degree, set their own priorities." Renewed self-determination by tribes “altered the nature of the and the relationship between tribes and the federal government”. The independence gained by tribes from dealing with the Office of Economic Opportunity helped change the dynamic of Indian affairs in relation to the federal government. 
The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) is a national legal-advocacy and nonprofit organization founded by Indians in 1970 to assist Indians in their legal battles. It has become the primary national advocacy group for Native Americans. "It is funded largely by grants from private foundations and (despite its adversarial relationship) the Federal Government.” NARF’s legal, policy, and public education work is concentrated in five key areas: preservation of tribes; protection of tribal natural resources; promotion of Native American human rights; accountability of governments to Native Americans; and development of Indian law and educating the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues. “NARF focuses on applying existing laws and treaties to guarantee that national and state governments live up to their legal obligations . . . works with religious, civil rights, and other Native American organizations to shape the laws that will help assure the civil and religious rights of all Native Americans.” Since its inception, NARF has provided legal expertise at the national level. NARF has trained many young attorneys, both Indians and non-Indians, who intend to specialize in Native American legal issues. "NARF has successfully argued every Supreme Court case involving Native Americans since 1973." NARF has affected tens of thousands of Indian people in its work for more than 250 tribes in all fifty states to develop strong self-governance, sound economic development, prudent natural resources management and positive social development. It continues to handle civil rights cases for the Native American community in the United States.
Local.
Accomplishments and progress of Native American organizations on the national level inspired change on the local level. It did not take too long for local tribes to begin to establish their own organizations that would benefit them directly. One of the earliest of such organizations was the Determination of Rights and Unity for Menominee Shareholders (DRUMS) - a citizens' group founded in 1970. It focused on stopping the Legend Lake sales, establishing Menominee control over the Menominee Enterprises, Inc. (MEI), and, eventually, even reversing termination, which was the main purpose of self-determination. DRUMS made an immediate impact. Within months of establishment, the Menominee organized a series of well-planned and smoothly executed demonstrations. In an effort to interrupt the Legend Lake land development, DRUMS picketed Legend Lake’s Menominee County sales office and promotional events in nearby cities, such as Milwaukee, Green Bay, and Appleton. In October 1971, DRUMS led an impressive 12-day, from Menominee County, to the state capitol in Madison. Like the other DRUMS protests, the march to Madison, was non-violent but sharp-edged nonetheless. Minnesota Governor Patrick Lucey met with DRUMS leaders and discussed prevalent issues in the Menominee community. Within a month of the march, Governor Lucey visited Menominee County, and consistently supported the Menominee movement. In addition, DRUMS managed to produce a first draft of the Menominee restoration bill by the end of 1971 and by early 1972 the tribe had already obtained an astounding level of support, including the support of Democratic Presidential nominee Henry Jackson. Though it took a prodigious amount of work, the Menominee Restoration Act moved through Congress with rare speed. In April 1975, MEI was dissolved and all Menominee lands were transferred back to the tribe, to be held in trust by the United States of America and governed by the sovereign Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin. Although DRUMS set its sights on improving the status of the local Menominee people, it was a big step toward the nation-wide self-determination movement. The success of DRUMS let other Indians know that they too could make an impact, if only on a local level, and motivated other tribes to fight for their rights. On the national scope, DRUMS allowed Native American leaders to assume prominent positions. For instance, Ada Deer was catapulted to the top of the federal government; In 1993, Deer was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Interior by President Bill Clinton and served as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1993–1997.
Institutional capacity.
The new policy of the Office of Economic Opportunity, which sought to directly involve the recipients of its aid, provided further impetus for self-determination in education. The success of the OEO Head Start preschool program was attributed primarily to the fact that Indians were "allowed to operate programs." For the first time in history, Deloria commented, "Indian parents have become excited about education for their children. . . . For the last 100 years, the Government has been doing things for us and telling us what is best for Indians . . . of course there has been no progress . . ." Progress in education was just one area in which Native Americans were gaining more independence. As tribes began to have more control over their own affairs and have more infrastructure entitled to them, they were able to be in much more command of their space, make more money, which lead to power and progress.

Solar eclipse of August 1, 2008

A total solar eclipse occurred on August 1, 2008. 
It had a magnitude of 1.0394 that was visible from a narrow corridor through northern Canada (Nunavut), Greenland, central Russia, eastern Kazakhstan, western Mongolia and China. Occurring north of the arctic circle, it belonged to the so-called midnight sun eclipses. The largest city on the path of the eclipse was Novosibirsk in Russia.
The total eclipse lasted for 2 minutes, and covered 0.4% of the Earth's surface in a 10,200 km long path. It was the 47th eclipse of the 126th Saros cycle, which began with a partial eclipse on March 10, 1179 and will conclude with a partial eclipse on May 3, 2459.
A partial eclipse could be seen from the much broader path of the Moon's penumbra, including northeastern North America and most of Europe and Asia.
It was described by observers as "special for its colours around the horizon. There were wonderful oranges and reds all around, the clouds lit up, some dark in silhouette, some golden, glowing yellowy-orange in the distance. You could see the shadow approaching against the clouds and then rushing away as it left"
Start of eclipse: Canada, Greenland and Norway.
The eclipse began in the far north of Canada in Nunavut at 09:21 UT, the zone of totality being 206 km wide, and lasting for 1 minute 30 seconds. The path of the eclipse then headed north-east, crossing over northern Greenland and reaching the northernmost latitude of 83° 47′ at 09:38 UT before dipping down into Russia.
The path of totality touched the northeast corner of Kvitøya, an uninhabited Norwegian island in the Svalbard archipelago, at 09:47 UT.
Greatest eclipse: Russia.
The eclipse reached the Russian mainland at 10:10 UT, with a path 232 km wide and a duration of 2 minutes 26 seconds. The greatest eclipse occurred shortly after, at 10:21:07 UT at coordinates (close to Nadym), when the path was 237 km wide, and the duration was 2 minutes 27 seconds. Cities in the path of the total eclipse included Megion, Nizhnevartovsk, Strezhevoy, Novosibirsk and Barnaul. Around 10,000 tourists were present in Novosibirsk, the largest city to experience the eclipse.
Conclusion: China.
The path of the eclipse then moved south-east, crossing into Mongolia and just clipping Kazakhstan at around 10:58 UT. The path here was 252 km wide, but the duration was decreased to 2 minutes 10 seconds. The path then ran down the China-Mongolia border, ending in China at 11:18 UT, with an eclipse lasting 1 minute 27 seconds at sunset. The total eclipse finished at 11:21 UT. The total eclipse passed over Yiwu, Juiquan and Xi’an. Around 10,000 people were gathered to watch the eclipse in Yiwu.
Partial eclipse.
A partial eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the Moon's penumbra, including the north east coast of North America and most of Europe and Asia. In London, England, the partial eclipse began at 08:33 GMT, with a maximum eclipse of 12% at 09:18 GMT, before concluding at 10:05 GMT. At Edinburgh the partial eclipse was 23.5% of the sun, whilst it was 36% in Lerwick in the Shetland Isles.
LTU 1111.
German charter airline LTU, now trading as Air Berlin, operated a special flight from Düsseldorf to the North Pole to observe the eclipse. Flight number LT 1111 spent over 11 hours in the air, returning to base at 6pm after flying a planeload of eclipse chasers, scientists, journalists and TV crews to watch the celestial event. The route also included a low-level sightseeing tour of Svalbard before the eclipse and the magnetic pole afterwards.

Wulfsige III

Wulfsige (or Wulfsige III) was a medieval Bishop of Sherborne and is considered a saint.
Wulfsige was nominated about 993. He died on 8 January 1002.
Wulfsige took part in the tenth century Benedictine monastic reform movement in England. He had been a monk of Glastonbury Abbey under Dunstan, became a monk of Westminster Abbey during Dunstan's tenure as Bishop of London, was appointed abbot of Westminster, probably from before 966, when he first occurs. He was appointed to Sherborne by King Edgar the Peaceful, and held the abbacy along with the bishopric of Sherborne until at least 997. It was as bishop of Sherborne that Wulfsige presided over the refoundation of the cathedral community as a Benedictine abbey in 998. In 1998 a one-day conference was held to celebrate the refoundation of the abbey of Sherbone, and a collection of essays, "St Wulfsige and Sherborne", was published in 2005.
Wulfsige is considered a saint and Goscelin wrote a haigiography of him.

Ben Amos

Benjamin Paul "Ben" Amos (born 10 April 1990) is an English footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Manchester United. Born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Amos began his career with Crewe Alexandra's youth academy, but joined Manchester United at the age of 11. He has spent time on loan at Peterborough United, Molde, and Oldham Athletic. Additionally, Amos is an England youth international, having represented his country at every level from Under-16 to Under-21.
Club career.
Crewe Alexandra.
Amos was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire and was a member of the Crewe Alexandra academy until he was released at the age of 10. While at Crewe, he also played for another local team, Bollington United, as a centre midfielder. One year, Amos was playing for his local team against the team at the top of the table, and they needed to win the match to win the league. Amos' team's goalkeeper was injured during the game, and as the tallest on the team, Amos was put in goal; however, he had also been the team's regular penalty taker all season, so when they were awarded a penalty, he went all the way up the pitch to take the kick. He scored, and his team went on to win the game 3–2, together with the league title. After the game, his parents told him that a Manchester United scout had been watching him and that he had been invited for trials. Amos joined Manchester United at the age of 11.
Manchester United.
In his first season at Manchester United, Amos became a regular starter for the club's Under-13 team, playing in 19 out of 27 matches in the 2001–02 season. Amos was named as an unused substitute for the Under-18 side for the first time on 8 January 2005, for a league game against Manchester City. His first appearance for the Under-18s came exactly nine months later, on 8 October 2005, coming on as a substitute for Danny Rose after starting goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler was sent off in a 2–0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers. He was regularly named as an unused substitute during the 2005–06 season – including for two reserve team matches – but became a frequent starter for the Under-18s in 2006–07 after signing a trainee contract in July 2006. However, he missed the final of the 2006–07 FA Youth Cup with a dislocated shoulder.
He retained his place in the Under-18 team for 2007–08, in addition to making his debut for the reserve team against Wigan Athletic on 7 November 2007, and during the season he impressed enough to be selected to go on the first-team's 2008 summer tour of South Africa. Amos was named as a substitute for all three matches of the tour, but did not play. En route back from South Africa, United stopped off in Nigeria to play against Portsmouth on 27 July 2008, with Amos replacing Tomasz Kuszczak after 76 minutes. He made his competitive first-team debut on 23 September 2008 in a 3–1 win at home to Middlesbrough in the third round of the League Cup. On 14 December 2008, Amos travelled to Japan with the Manchester United squad for the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup, having been called up as a late replacement for Ben Foster, who had suffered a hand injury while training.
Loans to Peterborough and Molde.
On 29 October 2009, Amos signed for the Championship team Peterborough United on a month's loan as cover for Peterborough's suspended first-choice goalkeeper Joe Lewis. He made his only appearance on 31 October in a 2–1 defeat against Barnsley. After returning to Manchester United, Amos was again sent out on loan in March 2010, this time to Norwegian side Molde FK, where he remained on loan until 30 June 2010.
Return to Manchester United.
Following the departure of Ben Foster from Manchester United to Birmingham City, United manager Alex Ferguson declared that Amos would be Manchester United's third-choice goalkeeper for the 2010–11 season behind Edwin van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak. He made his first appearance of the season on 26 October 2010, starting in goal for United's 3–2 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the fourth round of the League Cup.
In United's final Champions League group match on 7 December 2010, Amos was picked to start against Valencia at Old Trafford. Pablo Hernández scored Valencia's only goal past him after 32 minutes of the match – the first goal United had conceded in the Champions League that season – as the two sides played out a 1–1 draw.
Loan to Oldham Athletic.
With the signing of Danish goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard, Manchester United allowed Amos to join Oldham Athletic on loan for the remainder of the season on 7 January 2011, although he would continue to train with Manchester United once a week. He made his debut against Swindon Town the next day and kept a clean sheet. However, three days later, he conceded all six goals in a 6–0 defeat at home to Southampton; he allowed Adam Lallana's 20-yard shot underneath his body for the second goal, and he was rounded by Lee Barnard for the sixth.
On 15 March 2011, Lindegaard was ruled out for five weeks following a knee injury, so Amos was recalled from Oldham to cover for Edwin van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak.
Return to Manchester United.
Amos made his first start of the 2011–12 season in a third round League Cup tie at Elland Road against Leeds United. He kept a clean sheet as United cruised through to the next round winning 3–0. He played again in the following round away at Aldershot Town, a game which United also won 3–0 and advanced to the quarter finals. He was in goal again for United's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November. It also seemed that he had moved above last season's second choice Tomasz Kuszczak in the pecking order, but was now third choice behind Anders Lindegaard and David de Gea. He made his first Premier League start in a 2–0 home win against Stoke City on 31 January 2012, keeping a clean sheet on his debut.
On 30 May 2012, Amos signed a three-year contract extension with Manchester United, which will keep him at the club until at least 2015.
Loan to Hull City.
On 31 July 2012, Amos joined Championship team Hull City on a season-long loan from Manchester United. Before the loan deal was completed, he had joined Hull on their pre-season training camp in Portugal. He made his debut on 11 August 2012 in 7–6 penalty shoot-out victory over Rotherham United in the first round of the 2012–13 Football League Cup. However, after 19 appearances, including two in the League Cup, Amos returned to Manchester United on 3 January 2013.
Loan to Carlisle United.
On 15 November 2013, Amos joined League One team Carlisle United on a month-long loan from Manchester United.
International career.
Amos is an England youth international, having played for his country at the Under-16, Under-17, Under-18, Under-19, Under-20 and Under-21 levels. He was called up to the Under-21 squad in 2011 for their friendly match against Iceland, but he was an unused substitute.

Baytown culture

The Baytown culture was a Pre-Columbian Native American culture that existed from 300 to 700 CE in the lower Mississippi River Valley, consisting of sites in eastern Arkansas, western Tennessee, Louisiana, and western Mississippi. The Baytown Site on the White River in Monroe County, Arkansas is the type site for culture. It was a Baytown Period culture during the Late Woodland period. It was contemporaneous with the Coastal Troyville and Troyville cultures of Louisiana and Mississippi (all three had evolved from the Marksville Hopewellian peoples) and the Fourche Maline culture and was succeeded by the Plum Bayou culture. Where the Baytown peoples built dispersed settlements, the Troyville people instead continued building major earthwork centers.
Decline of the Hopewell.
Archeologists have traditionally viewed the Late Woodland (about 1,500 to 1,000 years ago) as a time of cultural decline after the florescence of the Hopewell peoples. Late Woodland sites, with the exception of sites along the Florida Gulf Coast, tend to be small when compared with Middle Woodland sites. There are several possible explanations.
In all probability these 4 theories are quite inter-related and may have all played a role in the development of the Baytown culture. 
Although few outstanding works of prehistoric art or architecture can be attributed to this time period, analysis shows that throughout the Southeast, the Late Woodland was a very dynamic period. Bow-and-arrow technology, allowing for increased hunting efficiency, and new varieties of maize, beans, and squash gained importance, which greatly supplemented existing native seed and root plants. Although settlement size was small, there was an increase in the number of Late Woodland sites over Middle Woodland sites, indicating a population increase. These factors tend to mark the Late Woodland period as an expansive period, not one of a cultural collapse.
Material culture.
Diet.
Baytown people grew domesticated plants native to eastern North America, such as maygrass, little barley, amaranth, and chenopodium, with lesser amounts of sunflower, sumpweed, knotweed, squash, and bottle gourd. Acorns and hickory nuts were important in the diet, as well as wild fruits such as persimmons, plums, cherries, and various berries and grapes. People hunted white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, turkeys, passenger pigeons, and migratory wildfowl using bows and arrows. They caught various species of fish and aquatic turtles, depending on what lived in the nearby bodies of water.
Pottery.
Distinctive styles of flat-based pottery jars, hemispherical bowls, and stone points used on atlatl darts are associated with the Baytown culture. Plum Bayou culture developed out of Baytown culture; and there is not a sharp dividing line between the two. They overlap in time, and pottery designs and decorative motifs of the Plum Bayou culture were found at the Baytown Site, indicating that use of that site continued after 650 CE. Mulberry Creek Cord Marked, Larto Red, Coles Creek Incised, and Officer Punctated ceramics were found at the Baytown Site.

<doc id="19442385" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19442385" title="Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System">
Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System

Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) is a positive train control cab signaling system developed by PHW and Alstom. The system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, protect against overspeed and protect work crews with temporary speed restrictions. The information about permanent and temporary speed restrictions is transmitted to the train by transponders lying in the track, coded track circuits and digital radio. It is installed on parts of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston.
General system design.
ACSES provides railway trains with positive enforcement of "civil" speed restrictions (those based on the physical characteristics of the line). The on board components keeps track of a train's position and continuously calculates a maximum safe braking curve for upcoming speed restrictions. If the train exceeds the safe braking curve then the train brakes are automatically applied. 
There are two kinds of speed restrictions which are enforced by the system:
Data regarding permanent speed restrictions and other information about the permanent way and track configuration are loaded into an on board database while temporary speed restrictions are provided to the train while en route via a wireless data system. The on board equipment tracks the trains position by counting wheel rotations between a series of fixed Balises set between the rails. In the event a train's crew exceeds a speed restriction a penalty brake application is applied bringing the train to a complete stop in the same fashion as existing Automatic Train Control systems.
Speed restrictions required by the signal system are provided by the legacy Pulse code cab signaling system, which has been in service on various railroads since the 1930s. The cab signal codes are fed into the ACSES cab display unit, which then enforces the more restrictive of the two speeds. The on board ACSES unit is backwards compatible and can function where only the cab signaling is present without the ACSES overlay as well of situations where ACSES is available without cab signals. 
ACSES also enforces a positive stop at signals displaying an absolute Stop indication. The on board database allows the train to keep track of when it is approaching an absolute signal and then determine if a positive stop is required depending on cab signal indication and information provided via a local data radio. The system will stop the train in a Positive Stop Zone, extending up to 1000 feet from the absolute stop signal. To pass the stop signal or otherwise move the train in absence of a more favorable signal indication a "Stop Release" button must be engaged by the engineer before the brakes can be released. 
Due to several limitations of the ACSES system and various contingency operations, employees must still be familiar with all permanent and temporary speed restrictions. ACSES is meant to supplement, not replace employee's knowledge and skills
The combination of continuous cab signals and ACSES meet the definition of a Positive Train Control system by providing collision protection, enforcement of all speed restrictions and enforcement of track possession by maintenance forces. The deployment of ACSES by Amtrak in 2000 created the first wide scale PTC system on the North American rail network.
On-board equipment.
The on-board equipment consists of an computer that also stores the route characteristics database, a distance measurement subsystem to track train position, an antenna subsystem for the track mounted Balises, and a data radio subsystem for communication with wayside systems. In the cab, the driver has a consolidated display which displays the train's ACSES target speed along with the cab signal speed and other useful operating information.
Messages conveyed to and from locomotive and ground-based systems are made up of ATCS-encoded (Advanced Train Control Systems) message frames.
Field equipment.
The system begins with passive transponders attached between the tracks which are electrically powered by an electromagnetic field when a locomotive passes over them. The transponders digitally convey their identification information and other relevant bits of information via wires to a trackside Base Station Controller (BCM), which uses a data radio to communicate with the locomotive’s on board computers, allowing the locomotives to know precisely when they have reached a particular waypoint. This location information is utilized by the on board systems when consulting its database of speed restrictions and track characteristics to calculate a real time braking curve.
As the locomotive proceeds down the track, the on board systems communicate via radio to the trackside BCMs in the region, requesting any temporary speed restrictions for the next three or more regions of the track, ensuring that the locomotive’s database is always kept current with any possible temporary restrictions issued by the train dispatcher. Wayside Communications Managers (WCM) (or packet switches) link all the BCMs in the region to a backhaul network which allows them to communicate with the dispatcher's office and associated control systems via TCP/IP. This design provides locomotives with information about speed restrictions as soon as they go into effect without having to rely on voice communications with the train crew.
Additional BCMs (data radios) located at interlockings transmit information relating to absolute Stop signal indications and any speed restrictions pertaining to the train's route through said interlocking. Speed information acquired in this fashion will be displayed on the ACSES speed readout to supplement any speed information provided by the cab signaling system. After a positive stop the data radios will also transmit information releasing the train from the stop when track conditions permit. Such information about the status of the track occupancy, switch position, signal indication, and a host of other vital inputs—is accumulated by wayside encoders, such as a Safetran VIU-ACSES (see photo to the right), before being sent to the BCMs for transmission to locomotives.
The ACSES system also supports the use of temporary fixed transponders to enforce a temporary speed restrictions as an alternative or backup to using the wireless network. One transponder is placed a safe braking distance from the start of the to engage the restriction and a second is placed at the end of the restriction to release it.
Office equipment.
In the office where dispatch and control is performed, a system provides a visual indication of the current status of communications with all locomotives as well as a close approximation of where each locomotive is currently located along the track.
In the event that maintenance is needed along any section of the track, before a work crew is dispatched or before a work crew is granted authority to proceed, a temporary speed restriction (TSR) is created in the office computer systems. After a series of verifications and procedures, the TSR is presented to the ACSES office system.
When a locomotive issues a query for TSRs for a given region, the WCM conveys the request for information to the office system via TCP/IP and the response is conveyed back to the locomotive which updates its local database with any restrictions.
Redundancy.
There are a number of redundant components in the overall ACSES system such that a failure of a subsystem will swap over to another automatically. The loss of a WCM, for example, due to a power outage or lightning strike results in a standby WCM taking over the communications duties between BCMs and the office systems.
Because a locomotive's radio is capable of being heard by a number of BCMs, the WCM examines the indication RF signal strength of each BCM that heard the locomotive to determine what the strongest talk path back to the locomotive is. The WCM maintains a record of three possible talk paths to the locomotive such that the strongest path is always selected if the office needs to communicate back to the locomotive.
As a locomotive moves from region to region, the radio signal strengths recorded by BCMs which get conveyed to the WCMs change. BCMs which fall out of range of locomotives are removed from talk path routes within the WCM in favor of the BCMs which are coming into range. In this way the WCM is constantly aware of where each locomotive is located and which talk path is best used to communicate with the locomotive. Such information is also conveyed to the office so that office systems may make use of it.
Another aspect of redundancy is the system design which looks forward along the track, acquiring TSRs for the future in the event a temporary communications failure occurs. Since each locomotive has TSRs for at least three future segments of the rail line, in the event there is a segment of the track which for some reason has lost radio communication to the office, the locomotive has TSR information for the "dark" segment already before it proceeds into the dark segment.
In the event of a loss of all redundant standby systems (such as might occur due to a wide area power failure or communications failure with the central office) the system will indicate to the locomotive engineer that it has lost the ability to enforce temporary speed restrictions, but the permanent restrictions loaded into the on board database will continue to be enforced.
Finally, the cab signals are considered a completely independent system that transmits a continuous stream of codes through the rails instead of via wireless transmission. Any fault in the ACSES overlay will not affect the cab signal system and moreover a cab signal failure will not affect the ACSES system. Without cab signals ACSES will continue to enforce positive stops at absolute signals, all permanent and temporary speed restrictions and a positive stop at any signal at the entrance to cab signal without fixed wayside signal territory that is not displaying "Clear to Next Interlocking."
Failsafe operation.
If a locomotive is unable to automatically retrieve temporary speed restriction information permanent speed restrictions will continue to be enforced. In the event of a total failure of the on board ACSES system the engineer may revert to the use of the cab signal system without civil speed enforcement. Both situations require permission to be obtained from the train dispatcher and are accompanied by additional maximum speed restrictions. In addition the ACSES system installed on Acela Express trainsets checks the status of the on board tilting mechanism and if the tilt is not functioning will revert to a lower set of track speeds.
At interlockings where the Data Radio (BCM) is either not installed or not functioning the train will determine if a positive stop is necessary via the cab signaling system. If it is necessary to pass a signal at Stop after receiving authorization from the dispatcher ACSES will limit the train to 15mph within the interlocking limits after use of the Stop Release button. The ACSES system also supports direct dispatcher authorization of passing a Stop signal instead of the use of the use of a Stop Release button.

Stuttering Foundation of America

The Stuttering Foundation of America is a non-profit charitable organization working toward the prevention and improved treatment of stuttering. A 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, The Stuttering Foundation was established by Malcolm Fraser, the co-founder of Genuine Parts Company, in 1947 in Memphis, Tennessee The Stuttering Foundation provides a toll-free helpline and free online resources including referral services, support and information for people who stutter and their families, as well as research into the causes of stuttering.
Today, Malcolm Fraser's daughter, Jane Fraser, is president of the Foundation. In 2007, Fraser was named the Nonprofit Executive of the Year by The NonProfit Times. The Foundation sponsors educational conferences, workshops and symposia, and week-long intensive training workshops for speech-language pathologists.
History.
In 1947, Malcolm Fraser, a young man from Memphis, Tennessee, knew about stuttering from personal, often painful experience. He decided to do what he could to help others who stutter, and met with one of the foremost authorities of the day, Dr. Charles Van Riper, to discuss founding a nonprofit charitable organization.
The organization Fraser founded became today's Stuttering Foundation of America. Its goal was to provide the best and most up-to-date information and help available for the prevention of stuttering in young children and the most effective treatment available for teenagers and adults.
More than sixty years later, the Stuttering Foundation continues to pursue these same goals, although the tools to accomplish them are more varied and widespread. As it did when Malcolm Fraser turned his dream into reality, the Foundation dedicates itself to the contemporary concerns of all those who stutter.
Founder.
Malcolm Fraser knew from personal experience what the person who stutters is up against. His introduction to stuttering corrective procedures first came at the age of fifteen under the direction of Frederick Martin, M.D., who at that time was Superintendent of Speech Correction for the New York City schools.
A few years later, he worked with J. Stanley Smith, L.L.D., a stutterer and philanthropist, who, for altruistic reasons, founded the Kingsley Clubs in Philadelphia and New York that were named after the English author, Charles Kingsley, who also stuttered.
The Kingsley Clubs were small groups of adult stutterers who met one night a week to try out treatment ideas then in effect. In fact, they were actually practicing group therapy as they talked about their experiences and exchanged ideas. This exchange gave each of the members a better understanding of the problem. The founder often led the discussions at both clubs.
In 1928 he joined his older brother Carlyle who founded the NAPA Genuine Parts Company that year in Atlanta, Georgia. Malcolm Fraser became an important leader in the company and was particularly outstanding in training others for leadership roles.
In 1947, with a successful career under way, he founded the Stuttering Foundation of America. In subsequent years, he generously added $20 million to the endowment so that at the present time, endowment income covers over fifty percent of the operating budget.
In 1984, Malcolm Fraser received the fourth annual National Council on Communicative Disorders Distinguished Service Award. The NCCD, a council of 32 national organizations, recognized the Foundation's efforts in "adding to stutterers, parents, clinicians, and the public's awareness and ability to deal constructively with stuttering."
In 1989, Hamilton College, Clinton, New York, presented Fraser with the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters for his outstanding work on behalf of those who stutter. Malcolm Fraser was honored posthumously with the Charles Van Riper Award, presented by actor James Earl Jones at the 16th annual NCCD Awards Ceremony in Washington, D.C., September, 1997. Established by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association in 1995, the Van Riper Award was given to Fraser for his outstanding commitment to people who stutter.
Research.
The Foundation is turning its attention more and more to basic research in an effort to improve early detection and develop better therapies:
Brain Research.
Neuroimaging studies have greatly enhanced the potential to understand brain-behavior relationships in complex behaviors such as speech and language. Recent studies by Anne Foundas, M.D., Department of Neurology, LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans, reveal evidence that anatomic anomalies may play a role in stuttering.
Genetic Research.
Finding the genes involved in stuttering holds the promise of revealing some of the underlying causes of stuttering. The Foundation is actively involved in projects by Dr. Dennis Drayna of the National Institute on Deafness and other Communicative Disorders searching for genetic markers. In February, 2010, Drayna's research team identified the first 3 genes for stuttering.
Education.
From its inception, one of the primary goals of the Foundation has been to discuss and attempt to resolve the many questions surrounding stuttering. Through the years, the Foundation has met this challenge through a variety of educational meetings, seminars and resources, including:
Global Outreach.
In a groundbreaking alliance to help children who stutter through research, treatment and training programs, the Stuttering Foundation and the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children joined forces in 2006. 
The Michael Palin Centre based in London is widely considered one of the premier treatment centers in the world for childhood stuttering. 
This partnership means hope for thousands of children who stutter in addition to providing an essential training ground for researchers and clinicians.
Public Awareness.
An extensive public awareness campaign helps dispel misconceptions about stuttering, advises the public that help is available, offers that help, and focuses attention on the latest research.
Press releases have resulted in thousands of stories in print and segments on stuttering in the broadcast media, including CBS This Morning, The Today Show, CNN, NPR, and AP wire stories. These in turn generate thousands of calls from people seeking help.
Public service announcements and advertisements featuring nationally-recognized spokespersons reach millions each year through the generosity of national, regional and local magazines, radio and television stations.
Web sites in English and Spanish contain information for the general public as well as specific help for those who stutter. The Foundation's toll-free line is accessed by more than 20,000 callers each year.
Honors and Awards.
The Foundation’s work has been widely recognized. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association gave its highest award, the Distinguished Service Award, to the Foundation for its “dedication and effective contributions to the field of speech pathology.”
Founder Malcolm Fraser received the National Council on Communicative Disorders Distinguished Service Award, and President Jane Fraser was recognized by her alma mater with the Centennial Distinguished Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award for her efforts on behalf of those who stutter.
Jane Fraser also received the prestigious Outstanding Contribution Award during the International Stuttering Association World Congress in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on May 9, 2007. In presenting the award to Fraser, Melvin Hoffman of ISA said, “No one has done more to further the cause of helping those who stutter.”
Fraser was also named Nonprofit Executive of the Year by The NonProfit Times in 2008.

Nobelity

Nobelity is a feature documentary which looks at the world's most pressing problems through the eyes of Nobel laureates, including Desmond Tutu, Sir Joseph Rotblat, Ahmed Zewail and Wangari Maathai. The film was premiered at the 2006 SXSW Film Festival and was the first of several sold-out screenings at Austin's 1,200-seat Paramount Theatre. The film has continued to be shown in theaters, at universities and schools, and in community centers and churches, as well as being released on DVD. "Nobelity" was written and directed by writer, actor and filmmaker Turk Pipkin and produced by Christy Pipkin, in association with The Nobelity Project. 
The film interviews nine Nobel Prize winners discussing their vision for the world over the next 50 years.
The Laureates.
Steve Weinberg, Nobel Prize in Physics, 1979.
Steven Weinberg holds the Josey Regental Chair in Science at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is a member of the Physics and Astronomy Departments. His research on elementary particles and cosmology has been honored with numerous prizes and awards. In 1979,he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his development of a field theory that unifies the weak and electromagnetic nuclear forces within the atom.
In 1991, Weinberg was presented the National Medal of Science. In 2004, he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society, with a citation saying he is "considered by many to be the preeminent theoretical physicist alive in the world today".
Among his many writings on theoretical physics are several books for scientists and lay readers alike, including "The First Three Minutes", an eye-opening look at the origins of social commentary, and for his views on the essential role of science in society. Many of his writings on these and other subjects have appeared in "The New York Review of Books".
"Science can tell you how to achieve certain things if you want to achieve them," Dr. Weinberg told Turk Pipkin during their conversations for "Nobelity", "but it can’t tell you what you ought to achieve. There is an unbridgeable gulf between questions of what is and questions of what ought to happen."
Weinberg also works closely with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an independent non-profit alliance of more than 100,000 concerned citizens and scientists which augments scientific analysis with innovative thinking and committed citizen advocacy to build a cleaner, healthier environment and a safer world.
Richard E. Smalley, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1996.
Dr. Richard E. Smalley was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of the Buckministerfullerene or Buckyball, a unique molecular structure of 60 carbon atoms. Some of the strongest materials ever discovered, carbon nanostructures are currently being used in numerous practical applications.
Smalley's interest in science began in his early teens, and he has been an eloquent spokesman for the need to educate a new generation of scientists to find solutions to the world's problems. "Be a Scientist — Save the World" was the title of his lecture on the great energy challenges we face in the coming decades. Finding a new source of clean and reliable energy," he argued, "would enable us to solve numerous other world problems, including the need for clean water and plentiful food."
"There are good things about challenges," Smalley told Turk Pipkin while filming at Smalley's office at Rice University. "Challenge brings forth the best instincts of our youth and ourselves, and urges us on to develop technologies that would otherwise not get developed, so I see this as a good opportunity for the nation to seize on, and frankly for the world."
After a long battle with leukemia, Smalley died at age 62 on October 28, 2005.
Dr. Harold E. Varmus, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1989.
Former Director of the National Institute of Health under President Bill Clinton, Dr. Harold E. Varmus is currently the President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. A noted cancer biologist, Varmus is also a cyclist and a passionate advocate for increased health care spending and medical research around the world.
"As a fraction of our gross national product, the U.S. is at the bottom of the 22 wealthiest nations on a list of donors," he pointed out to Turk Pipkin during filming for "Nobelity". "Furthermore, only one-eighth of our foreign aid goes to health, and it doesn’t all go to the poorest countries."
In 1989, Varmus was awarded the Nobel Prize with J. Michael Bishop in recognition of their breakthrough research in identifying oncogenes, the discovery of which has dramatically improved our ability to understand and control cancer.
Varmus is also the co-founder of the Public Library of Science, a non-profit organization of scientists and physicians committed to opening the doors to the world's library of scientific knowledge by giving any scientist, physician, patient or student – anywhere in the world – unlimited access to the latest scientific research.
Jody Williams, Nobel Peace Prize, 1997.
Along with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which she helped to found, Jody Williams was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1997 for her work in the creation of an international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. At the time of the ICBL's founding, tens of millions of mines were deployed around the world in 80 countries, and each year mines were claiming as many as fifty thousand new victims — most of them civilians, many of them children — who were crippled, maimed and blinded by mines.
The treaty has since been signed by 152 countries (but not the U.S.), and more than 1,100 square kilometers of land have been cleared, destroying 4 million anti-personnel mines, nearly 1 million anti-vehicle mines, and many more millions of pieces of unexploded ordnance. Adding to these accomplishments, 62 million stockpiled anti-personnel mines have been destroyed.
In addition to being the chief strategist and spokesperson for the Campaign, Williams is an eloquent speaker on human rights, on the role of civil society in international diplomacy, and on individual initiative in bringing about social change.
"Every act you take on this planet contributes in one way or another to an outcome," says Jody. "When we launched the mine ban, we didn’t know what we would accomplish. But we did know it was the right thing to do."
Ahmed Zewail, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1999.
The Linus Pauling Professor of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, Ahmed Zewail was educated in his native Egypt before moving to America to attend Alexandria University and the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his PhD.
Zewail was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his seminal work in the field of femtochemistry, which made it possible to observe molecular changes measured in femtoseconds, a measurement equal to a millionth of a billionth of a second. This work has greatly expanded our understanding of molecular structure and the dynamics of matter, and has led to entire new fields of practical applications in technology and life sciences.
Well known for his public lectures and writings on science, technology, education and world affairs, Zewail is the author of the book, "Voyage through Time—Walks of Life to the Nobel Prize" in which he suggests a concrete course of action to address problems in the world of the have-nots.
Pointing out that he is an Egyptian, an Arab, an African, a Middle Easterner, a Mediterranean and an American, Zewail is well aware of his unique perspective on East-West relations.
Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace Prize, 2004.
The first environmentalist to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Prof. Wangari Muta Maathai is the founder of Kenya's Green Belt Movement (GBM), a grassroots non-governmental organization (NGO) which has created opportunity and change in the life of rural African women and dramatically improved the Kenyan environment through the planting of 30 million trees.
The first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree, Maathai earned degrees in the U.S. and in Kenya, where her work with the National Council of Women inspired her to create a program of planting trees by rural people — primarily women — in order to conserve the environment and improve quality of life.
Maathai's struggle for democracy, human rights and environmental conservation in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa resulted in her being beaten unconscious and jailed on multiple occasions, but her persistence has fostered incredible change in Kenya, where she received 98% of the vote in her election to Parliament.
Maathai travels the globe in support of development and reform in Africa.
Sir Joseph Rotblat, Nobel Peace Prize, 1995.
Born in Poland where he received his PhD, nuclear physicist and peace activist Sir Joseph Rotblat spent the past sixty years fighting against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Along with Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell, Rotblat was one of eleven scientists who in 1955 signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, a letter to the world calling for a total ban on nuclear weapons.
"I was the youngest of the people who signed," Rotblat explained to Turk Pipkin at Rotblat's home in the suburbs of London, "and now I am the only one still alive. This is the reason why I feel it is my duty, indeed it is my mission for the remaining days of my life, to alert the world to the continuing dangers of nuclear weapons."
In 1957, Rotblat was one of the founders of the Pugwash Conferences, a series of global gathering of scientists, scholars and public figures working to reduce the danger of armed conflict, and to seek cooperative solutions for global problems. Knighted in 1998, Rotblat published several works on the Pugwash movement, nuclear physics and world peace.
Rotblat died in 2005, not long after his conversations with Turk Pipkin for the film "Nobelity".
"As long as nuclear weapons exist," Sir Joseph told Turk, "sooner or later they will be used."
Though Rotblat feels the United States is now engaged in an overall policy of proliferation, he is confident that a return to American commitments to further reduce nuclear weapons — already pledged under the Non-Proliferation Treaty — would inspire other nations to follow suit.
Amartya Sen, Nobel Prize in Economics, 1998.
Indian economist Amartya Sen is one of the world's leading authorities on human development, human rights and the causes of famine. Currently the Lamont University Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University, Sen is the author of numerous books, including the landmark work, "Development as Freedom", in which he demonstrates that famine is not caused by a lack of food, but by an inability to purchase or acquire food due to poverty or a lack of a variety of freedoms.
In his latest book, "Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny (Issues of Our Time)", Sen argues that the antidote to divisive extremism lies in the freedom to choose one's identity affiliations rather than being labeled by narrow definitions of religion, class, sex or politics.
Born in Santiniketan, India, in 1933, Sen's research and writing have been in the fields of social choice theory, welfare economics and political philosophy. A strong proponent of women's rights, he has studied and written about the links between women's education and literacy and the reduction of birthrates in the developing world. On the meaning of freedom, Sen argues that freedom is not simply defined by the right to vote, but also by freedom from the insecurities of terrorism, from the lack of healthcare, and the freedom not to starve.
Meeting with Turk Pipkin at his boyhood home in Santiniketan – which means "World of Peace" – Sen's thoughts in "Nobelity" are eye-opening.
"It's not often recognized that on 9/11/2001," Sen pointed out, "more people died of AIDS than died of violence. On 9/11, and on every other day, many more times people die from preventable or manageable illnesses like AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis. That doesn’t reduce the importance of fighting terrorism, but along with that we have to engage the much bigger killers in the world."
Sen is also an Honorary Advisor — and the former Honorary President — of OXFAM, a development, relief and campaigning organization that works with others to find lasting solutions to poverty and suffering around the world.
Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize, 1984.
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as "a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa".
After the fall of apartheid, Tutu headed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was widely credited with helping South Africa avoid revenge oriented bloodshed following the fall of apartheid.
Born in 1931 in Transvaal, Tutu graduated from the University of South Africa and was ordained as a priest in 1960. After studying and teaching in England, in 1975 Tutu was appointed Dean of St. Mary's Cathedral in Johannesburg, the first black to hold that position.
He is the author of numerous books, including the recent "God has a Dream", in which he argues that God's dream is that one day we will also realize that we are truly one family, and will treat each other as we would members of our own family. 
Current projects.
While filming at a school in Kenya which had no water or electricity, Pipkin was inspired to join with his wife in a larger endeavor, the education and action chaity, The Nobelity Project, dedicated to a better world for children everywhere. The Project has also produced a sequel to "Nobelity", "One Peace at a Time", which focuses on solutions to the problems chronicled in the first film. Proceeds from the films serve as an endowment for current and future education projects, including Mahiga Hope High School; A high school in rural Kenya built by the Nobelity Project, and the subject of their 3rd feature documentary Building Hope

Project Graduate

Project Graduate is a student recruitment program designed to bring Kentuckians with 90 or more college credit hours but no bachelor's degree back to college to finish their degree. It is a collaborative effort between the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE), Kentucky's public universities and the Association of Independent Kentucky Colleges and Universities. 
The Goal.
As charged by the "Kentucky Postsecondary Education Act of 1997 "(HB1), the CPE leads efforts to increase the education attainment of Kentucky citizens to at least the national average by 2020. In alignment with HB 1, the Council released the “Double the Numbers Plan” in October 2007, calling for the state to double the number of Kentuckians with at least a bachelor’s degree by 2020. One of the key strategies of the Double the Numbers plan is to increase the number of working-age adults going to and completing college. The Council’s 2020 statewide target is to increase the percent of adults in college from 3.6 percent to 4.5 percent.
The Problem.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 500,000 Kentuckians have some college and no degree. State data analyzed by the CPE show more than 300,000 Kentucky adults between the ages of 25 and 50 have some college credit from a Kentucky public institution, but no degree. A closer look revealed 233,000 of them were between the ages of 25 and 40. Even more compelling, more than 11,000 of those former students have earned 90 or more credit hours.
The Response.
In May 2007, CPE staff convened a marketing work group to target the 11,000 adults with 90 or more credit hours to return to college to finish their degree. The workgroup was composed of public relations officers, enrollment managers, continuing education staff and/or student affairs representatives from each partner institution.
The highly targeted outreach effort, a part of the Council’s college access outreach campaign, was named Project Graduate. Participating universities developed campus action plans to provide a high-touch experience for their returning adult students. Each plan details the incentives and special services offered by the institution and identifies a campus response team to ensure those who respond and qualify can take advantage of incentives and quickly navigate the admissions process. 
The CPE developed a strong brand identity for Project Graduate, a customizable direct-mail campaign (postcards and a letter signed by the president) and a Project Graduate Web site that identified participating institutions, their incentives and their contact person. The Council publicly launched Project Graduate in November 2007 as a collaborative outreach effort with the institutions. Each institution initiated its own outreach efforts in spring 2008 using the customizable marketing products.
As of October 2008, Project Graduate teams at Kentucky’s public universities have helped at least 49 adults earn their bachelor’s degrees and 460 have returned to college and enrolled in classes. The Council is continuing to work with the Project Graduate team to support their efforts. A marketing communications plan is under development to step up outreach to this target audience and to identify strategies to reach out to the larger adult learner market in Kentucky.
The Partners.
Kentucky colleges and universities participating in Project Graduate include:
Public Colleges and Universities:
Independent Colleges and Universities:
The Research: Survey of Kentucky Adults with Some College.
While Project Graduate was being planned, the Council contracted with a national higher education research and marketing firm to conduct a statistically valid telephone survey of the broader audience—the 233,000 Kentuckians with some college. The survey sought to identify market segments of Kentucky adults with some college credit but no bachelor’s degree who could be motivated or receptive to incentives to re-enroll in college. 
The survey included 1,610 Kentucky adults with some college equally distributed in four regions across the state. Research findings will inform the development of an integrated marketing plan for the broader audience of adult learners, as well as further discussion on practices, programs and policies that will meet the unique needs of Kentucky’s adult learners.
Kentucky Adult Learner Initiative.
Building upon the research findings of the 2007 study of adults with some college, the Council launched the Kentucky Adult Learner Initiative to develop recommendations on practices, programs and policies to meet the unique needs of adult learners in postsecondary education. Funded by the Lumina Foundation for Education, the initiative kicked off with a Kentucky Adult Learner Initiative Summit in February 2008 and a statewide advisory board was formed to address the needs of the adult learner. Three work groups are convening throughout 2008 to develop recommendations to bring back to the advisory board in three areas: credit for prior learning, financial aid for adult learners, and flexible delivery of academic programs to increase adult learner access. Recommendations are expected to be finalized by December 2008.

Timucua

The Timucua were an Amerindian people who lived in Northeast and North Central Florida and southeast Georgia. They were the largest indigenous group in that area and consisted of about 35 chiefdoms, many leading thousands of people. The various groups of Timucua spoke several dialects of the Timucua language. At the time of European first contact, the territory occupied by speakers of Timucuan dialects occupied about , and was home to between 50,000 and 200,000 Timuacans. It stretched from the Altamaha River and Cumberland Island in present-day Georgia as far south as Lake George in central Florida, and from the Atlantic Ocean west to the Aucilla River in the Florida Panhandle, though it reached the Gulf of Mexico at no more than a couple of points.
The name "Timucua" (from "Thimogona") came from the exonym used by the Saturiwa (of what is now Jacksonville) to refer to the Utina, another group to the west of the St. Johns River. The Spanish came to use the term more broadly for other peoples in the area. Eventually it became the common term for all peoples who spoke what is known as the Timucuan language.
While alliances and confederacies arose between the chiefdoms from time to time, the Timucua were never organized into a single political unit. The various groups of Timucua speakers practiced several different cultural traditions. The people suffered severely from the introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity. By 1595, their population was estimated to have been reduced from 200,000 to 50,000 and thirteen chiefdoms remained. By 1700, the population of the tribe had been reduced to 1000. Warfare against them by the English colonists and native allies completed their extinction as a tribe soon after the turn of the 19th century.
Name.
The word "timucuan" may derive from "Thimogona" or "Tymangoua", an exonym used by the Saturiwa tribe for their enemies, the Utina. Both groups spoke dialects of the Timucua language. The French followed the Saturiwa in this usage, but the Spanish applied the term "Timucua" much more widely to groups within a wide section of interior North Florida. In the 16th century they designated the area north of the Santa Fe River between the St. Johns River and the Suwannee River (roughly the area of the group known as the Northern Utina) as the Timucua Province, which they incorporated into the mission system. The dialect spoken in that province became known as "Timucua" (now usually known as "Timucua proper"). During the 17th century, the Province of Timucua was extended to include the area between the Suwannee River and the Aucilla River, thus extending its scope. Eventually, "Timucua" was applied to all speakers of the various dialects of the Timucua language.
History.
The pre-Columbian era was marked by regular, routine, and probably small tribal wars with neighbors. The Timucua were a large and powerful group, made up of as many as 35 chiefdoms, each of which had hundreds of people in assorted villages within its purview. They sometimes formed loose political alliances, but did not operate as a single political unit.
An archaeological dig in St. Augustine in 2006 revealed a Timucuan site dating back to between 1100 and 1300 CE, predating the European founding of the city by more than two centuries.Included in the discovery were pottery, with pieces from the Macon, Georgia, area, indicating an expansive trade network; and two human skeletons. It is the oldest archeological site in the city.
The Timucua may have been the first American natives to see the landing of Juan Ponce de León near St. Augustine in 1513. Later, in 1528, Pánfilo de Narváez's expedition passed along the western fringes of the Timucua territory.
In 1539, Hernando de Soto led an army of more than 500 men through the western parts of Timucua territory, stopping in a series of villages of the Ocale, Potano, Northern Utina, and Yustaga branches of the Timucua on his way to the Apalachee domain (see list of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition for other sites visited by de Soto). His army seized the food stored in the villages, took women for consorts, and forced men and boys to serve as guides and bearers. The army fought two battles with Timucua groups, resulting in heavy Timucua casualties. De Soto was in a hurry to reach the Apalachee domain, where he expected to find gold and sufficient food to support his army through the winter, so he did not linger in Timucua territory. De Soto quick departure was prompted by an effective guerrilla defense organized by the warrior chieftain Acuera, whose people beheaded fourteen of the invading conquistadors while suffering relatively few casualties compared to the massacres unleashed by the Spaniards in other places.
In 1564, French Huguenots led by René Goulaine de Laudonnière founded Fort Caroline in present-day Jacksonville and attempted to establish further settlements along the St. Johns River. After initial conflict, the Huguenots established friendly relations with the local natives in the area, primarily the Timucua under the "cacique" Saturiwa. Sketches of the Timucua drawn by Jacques le Moyne de Morgues, one of the French settlers, have proven valuable resources for modern ethnographers in understanding the people. The next year the Spanish under Pedro Menéndez de Avilés surprised the Huguenots and ransacked Fort Caroline, killing everyone but 50 women and children and 26 escapees. The rest of the French had been shipwrecked off the coast and picked up by the Spanish, who executed all but 20 of them; this brought French settlement in Florida to an end. These events caused a rift between the natives and Spanish, though Spanish missionaries were soon out in force.
The Timucua history changed after the Spanish established St. Augustine in 1565 as the capital of their province of Florida. From here, Spanish missionaries established missions in each main town of the Timucuan chiefdoms, including the Santa Isabel de Utinahica mission in what is now southern Georgia, for the Utinahica. By 1595, the Timucuan population had shrunk by 75%, primarily from epidemics of new infectious diseases introduced by contact with Europeans, and war.
By 1700, the Timucuan population had been reduced to just 1000. In 1703 the British with the Creek, Catawba, and Yuchi began killing and enslaving hundreds of the Timucua. Seventeen years later their number had dropped to just 250. In 1726 there were 176, and by 1752 only 26 remained. By the time the United States acquired Florida in 1821, only five or fewer Timucua remained. They became extinct as a people.
Tribes.
The Timucua were divided into a number of different tribes or chiefdoms, each of which spoke one of the nine or ten dialects of the Timucua language. The tribes can be placed into eastern and western groups. The Eastern Timucua were located along the Atlantic coast and on the Sea Islands of northern Florida and southeastern Georgia; along the St. Johns River and its tributaries; and among the rivers, swamps and associated inland forests in southeastern Georgia, possibly including the Okefenokee Swamp. They usually lived in villages close to waterways, participated in the St. Johns culture or in unnamed cultures related to the Wilmington-Savannah culture, and were more focused on exploiting the resources of marine and wetland environments. All of the known Eastern Timucua tribes were incorporated into the Spanish mission system starting in the late 16th century.
The Western Timucua lived in the interior of the upper Florida peninsula, extending to the Aucilla River on the west and into Georgia to the north. They usually lived in villages in forests, and participated in the Alachua, Suwannee Valley or other unknown cultures. Because of their environment, they were more oriented to exploiting the resources of the forests.
Earlier scholars such as John Swanton and John Goggin identified tribes around Tampa Bay – Tocobaga, the Uzita, and the Mocoso – as Timucua speakers, classed by Goggin as Southern Timucua. However, some of these tribes appear not to have spoken Timucua.
Eastern Timucua.
The largest and best known of the eastern Timucua groups were the Mocama, who lived in the coastal areas of what are now Florida and southeastern Georgia, from St. Simons Island to south of the mouth of the St. Johns River. They gave their name to the Mocama Province, which became one of the major divisions of the Spanish mission system. They spoke a dialect also known as Mocama (Timucua for "Ocean"), which is the best attested of the Timucua dialects. At the time of European contact, there were two major chiefdoms among the Mocama, the Saturiwa and the Tacatacuru, each of which had a number of smaller villages subject to them.
The Saturiwa were concentrated around the mouth of the St. Johns in what is now Jacksonville, and had their main village on Fort George Island. European contact with the Eastern Timucua began in 1564 when the French Huguenots under René Goulaine de Laudonnière established Fort Caroline in Saturiwa territory. The Saturiwa forged an alliance with the French, and at first opposed the Spanish when they arrived. Over time, however, they submitted to the Spanish and were incorporated into their mission system. The important Mission San Juan del Puerto was established at their main village; it was here that Francisco Pareja undertook his studies of the Timucua language. The Tacatacuru lived on Cumberland Island in present-day Georgia, and controlled villages on the coast. They too were incorporated into the Spanish mission system, with Mission San Pedro de Mocama being established in 1587.
Other Eastern Timucua tribes lived in southeastern Georgia. The Icafui and Cascangue tribes occupied the Georgia mainland north of the Satilla River, adjacent to the Guale. They spoke the Itafi dialect of Timucua. The Yufera tribe lived on the coast opposite to Cumberland Island and spoke the Yufera dialect. The Ibi tribe lived inland from the Yufera, and had 5 towns located 14 leagues (about 50 miles) from Cumberland Island; like the Icafui and Cascangue they spoke the Itafi dialect. All these groups participated in a culture that was intermediate between the St. Johns and Wilmington-Savannah cultures. The Oconi lived further west, perhaps on the east side of the Okefenokee Swamp. Both the Ibi and Oconi eventually received their own missions, while the coastal tribes were subject to San Pedro on Cumberland Island.
Up the St. Johns River to the south of the Saturiwa were the Utina, later known as the "Agua Dulce" or "Agua Fresca" (Freshwater) tribe. They lived along the river from roughly the Palatka area south to Lake George. They participated in the St. Johns culture and spoke the Agua Dulce dialect. The area between Palatka and downtown Jacksonville was relatively less populated, and may have served as a barrier between the Utina and Saturiwa, who were frequently at war. In the 1560s the Utina were a powerful chiefdom of over 40 villages. However, by the end of the century the confederacy had crumbled, with most of the diminished population withdrawing to six towns further south on the St. Johns.
The Acuera lived along the Ocklawaha River, and spoke the Acuera dialect.
Western Timucua.
Three major Western Timucua groups, the Potano, Northern Utina, and Yustaga, were incorporated into the Spanish mission system in the late 16th and 17th centuries.
The Potano lived in north central Florida, in an area covering Alachua County and possibly extending west to Cofa at the mouth of the Suwannee River. They participated in the Alachua culture and spoke the Potano dialect. They were among the first Timucua peoples to encounter Europeans, suffering an attack by Hernando de Soto's expedition in 1538. They were frequently at war with the Utina tribe, who managed to convince first the French and later the Spanish to join them in combined assaults against the Potano. They received missionaries in the 1590s and five missions were built in their territory by 1633. Like other Western Timucua groups they participated in the Timucua Rebellion of 1656.
North of the Potano, living in a wide area between the Suwanee and St. Johns Rivers, were the Northern Utina. This name is purely a convention; they were known as the "Timucua" to their contemporaries. They participated in the Suwanee Valley culture and spoke the "Timucua proper" dialect. The Northern Utina appear to have been less integrated than other Timucua tribes, and seem to have been organized into several small local chiefdoms, with the leader of one being recognized as paramount chief. They were missionized beginning in 1597 and their territory was organized by the Spanish as the Timucua Province. Over time smaller provinces were merged into the Timucua Province, thereby increasing the profile of the Northern Utina substantially. They took the forefront in the Timucua Rebellion of 1656, and their society declined severely when it was put down.
On the other side of the Suwanee River from the Northern Utina were the westernmost Timucua group, the Yustaga. They lived between the Suwanee and the Aucilla River, which served as a boundary with the Apalachee. They participated in the same Suwanee Valley culture as the Northern Utina, but appear to have spoken a different dialect, perhaps Potano. Unlike other Timucua groups, the Yustaga resisted Spanish missionary efforts until well into the 17th century. They maintained higher population levels significantly later than other Timucua groups, as their less frequent contact with Europeans kept them freer of introduced diseases. Like other Western Timucua groups, they participated in the Timucua Rebellion.
Other Western Timucua tribes are known from the earliest Spanish records, but later disappeared. The most significant of these are the Ocale, who lived in Marion County, near the modern city of Ocala, which takes its name from them. Ocale was conquered by De Soto in 1538 and the people dispersed; the town is unknown from later sources. However, both French and Spanish sources note a town named Eloquale or Etoquale in the Acuera chiefdom, suggesting that the Ocale may have migrated east and joined the Acuera. Hann has argued that the chiefdom of Mocoso, located near the mouth of the Alafia River on the eastern shore of Tampa Bay in the 16th century, was Timucuan. He suggest that the people of that chiefdom may have relocated to the village of Mocoso in Acuera province in the 17th century.
Culture.
Organization and classes.
The Timucua were not a unified political unit. Rather, they were made up of at least 35 chiefdoms, each consisting of about two to ten villages, with one being primary. In 1601 the Spanish noted more than 50 caciques (chiefs) subject to the head caciques of Santa Elena (Yustaga), San Pedro (Tacatacuru, on Cumberland Island), Timucua (Northern Utina) and Potano. The Tacatacuru, Saturiwa and Cascangue were subject to San Pedro, while the Yufera and Ibi, neighbors of the Tacatacuru and Cascangue, were independent.
Villages were divided into family clans, usually bearing animal names. Children always belonged to their mother's clan.
Customs.
The Timucua played two related but distinct ball games. Western Timucua played a game known as the "Apalachee ball game". Despite the name, it was as closely associated with the western Timucua as it was with the Apalachee. It involved two teams of around 40 or 50 players kicking a ball at a goal post. Hitting the post was worth one point, while landing it in an eagle's nest at the top of the post was worth two; the first team to score eleven points was the victor. The western Timucua game was evidently less associated with religious significance, violence, and fraud than the Apalachee version, and as such missionaries had a much more difficult time convincing them to give it up.
The eastern Timucua played a similar game in which balls were thrown, rather than kicked, at a goal post. The Timucua probably also played chunkey, as did the neighboring Apalachee and Guale peoples, but there is no firm evidence of this. Archery, running, and dancing were other popular pastimes.
The chief had a council that met every morning, when they would discuss the problems of the chiefdom and smoke. To initiate the meeting, the White Drink ceremony would be carried out (see "Diet" below). The council members were among the more highly respected members of the tribe.
Settlements.
The Timucua of northeast Florida (the Saturiwa and Agua Dulce tribes) at the time of first contact with Europeans lived in villages that typically contained about 30 houses, and 200 to 300 people. The houses were small, made of upright poles and circular in shape. Palm leaf thatching covered the pole frame, with a hole at the top for ventilation and smoke escape. The houses were 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 m) across and were used primarily for sleeping. A village would also have a council house which would usually hold all of the villagers. Europeans described some council houses as being large enough to hold 3,000 people. If a village grew too large, some of the families would start a new village nearby, so that clusters of related villages formed. Each village or small cluster of related villages had its own chief. Temporary alliances between villages for warfare were also formed. Ceremonial mounds might be in or associated with a village, but the mounds belonged to clans rather than villages.
Diet.
The Timucua were a semi-agricultural people and ate many foods native to North Central Florida. They planted maize (corn), beans, squash and various vegetables as part of their diet. Archaeologists' findings suggest that they may have employed crop rotation. In order to plant, they used fire to clear the fields of weeds and brush. They prepared the soil with various tools, such as the hoe. Later the women would plant the seeds using two sticks known as "coa". They also cultivated tobacco. Their crops were stored in granaries to protect them from the insects and weather. Corn was ground into flour and used to make corn fritters.
In addition to agriculture, the Timucua men would hunt game (including alligators, manatees, and maybe even whales); fish in the many streams and lakes in the area; and collect freshwater and marine shellfish. The women gathered wild fruits, palm berries, acorns, and nuts; and baked bread made from the root "koonti". Meat was cooked by boiling or over an open fire known as the "barbacoa", the origin of the word "barbecue". Fish were filleted and dried or boiled. Broths were made from meat and nuts.
After the establishment of many Spanish mission between 1595–1620, the Timuca were introduced to foods from European culture, including barley, cabbage, chickens, cucumbers, figs, garbanzo beans, garlic, European grapes, European greens, hazelnuts, various herbs, lettuce, melons, oranges, peas, peaches, pigs, pomegranates, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, watermelons, and wheat. Corn became a traded item and was exported to other Spanish colonies.
A black tea called "black drink" (or "white drink" because of its purifying effects) served a ceremonial purpose, and was a highly caffeinated Cassina tea, brewed from the leaves of the Yaupon Holly tree. The tea was only consumed by males in good status with the tribe. The drink was posited to have an effect of purification, and those who consumed it often vomited immediately. This drink was integral to most Timucua rituals and hunts.
Physical appearance.
Spanish explorers were shocked at the height of the Timucua, who averaged four inches or more above them. Timucuan men wore their hair in a bun on top of their heads, adding to the perception of height. Measurement of skeletons exhumed from beneath the floor of a presumed Northern Utina mission church (tentatively identified as San Martín de Timucua) at the Fig Springs mission site yielded a mean height of 64 inches (163 cm) for nine adult males and 62 inches (158 cm) for five adult women. The conditions of the bones and teeth indicated that the population of the mission had been chronically stressed. Each person was extensively tattooed. The tattoos were gained by deeds. Children began to acquire tattoos as they took on more responsibility. The people of higher social class had more elaborate decorations. The tattoos were made by poking holes in the skin and rubbing ashes into the holes. The Timucua had dark skin, usually brown, and black hair. They wore clothes made from moss, and cloth created from various animal skins.
Language.
The Timucua groups, never unified culturally or politically, are defined by their shared use of the Timucua language. The language is relatively well attested compared to other Native American languages of the period. This is largely due to the work of Francisco Pareja, a Franciscan missionary at San Juan del Puerto, who in the 17th century produced a grammar of the language and four catechisms in parallel Timucua and Spanish. The other sources for the language are two catechisms by another Franciscan, Gregorio de Movilla, two letters from Timucua chiefs, and bits and pieces in other European sources.
Pareja noted that there were ten dialects of Timucua, which were usually divided along tribal lines. These are Timucua proper, Potano, Itafi, Yufera, Mocama, Agua Salada, Tucururu, Agua Fresca, Acuera, and Oconi.

Perivascular epithelioid cell tumour

In oncology, PEComa, also PEC tumour and perivascular epithelioid cell tumour, is a family of mesenchymal tumours consisting of perivascular epithelioid cells (PECs). These are rare tumours that can occur in any part of the human body.
The cell type from which these tumours originate remains unknown. Normally, no perivascular epitheloid cells exist; the name refers to the characteristics of the tumour when examined under the microscope.
Establishing the malignant potential of these tumours remains challenging although criteria have been suggested; some PEComas display malignant features whereas others can cautiously be labeled as having 'uncertain malignant potential'. The most common tumours in the PEComa family are renal angiomyolipoma and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, both of which are more common in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. The genes responsible for this multi-system genetic disease have also been implicated in other PEComas.
Many PEComa types shows a female predominance in the sex ratio.
Histologic appearance.
PECs consist of perivascular epithelioid cells with a clear/granular cytoplasm and central round nucleus without prominent nucleoli.
Immunohistochemical markers.
PECs typically stain for melanocytic markers (HMB-45, Melan A (Mart 1), Mitf) and myogenic markers (actin, myosin, calponin).
PECs and other conditions.
PECs bear significant histologic and immunohistochemical similarity to:
Thus, it has been advocated that the above could be classified PEComas.
Etiology.
The precursor cell of PEComas is currently unknown; there is no normal counterpart "perivascular epitheloid cell". Genetically, PECs are linked to the tuberous sclerosis genes TSC1 and TSC2, although this link is stronger for angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis than for other members of the PEComa family.
Differential diagnosis.
PEComas are rare and can have myriad features; therefore, they can be confused with carcinomas, smooth muscle tumours, adipocytic tumours, clear cell sarcomas, melanomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).

Plague of Butterflies

Plague of Butterflies is the first EP by the melodic death metal/doom metal band Swallow the Sun. It was released on September 17, 2008 in Finland and September 23, 2008 worldwide through Spinefarm Records. The song, "Plague of Butterflies", runs about 35 minutes in length and is divided into three parts, the first being titled "Losing the Sunsets," second being "Plague of Butterflies" and the last titled "Evael 10:00."
The EP also includes the "Out of This Gloomy Light" and "Swallow (Horror Pt. 1)" demos.
Story.
This is a personal look on the story that "Plague of Butterflies" tells.
I - "Losing the Sunsets"
The song begins and sets up the story of a man who loses a loved one named Evael in the woods during the cold season of winter. It is unclear whether Evael is related to him or a woman he loves very much; but he goes back to the woods each day and stays there for hours waiting for her return. Years pass, yet she still does not come back. He eventually sorrowfully returns to his village, depressed another day has gone and Evael has not returned to him. We also learn that Evael is cursed with carrying butterflies wherever she goes and is not forgiven as the woods say, but the reason is never revealed.
II - "Plague of Butterflies"
The second chapter of the song begins as the man returns to his village where we learn that a plague has been ravaging the town, taking the lives of everyone living there except the man. The only living things apart from him left in the village are butterflies, which are in great number. He still remains in the village though, hoping that one day his beloved Evael will return from the woods. He searches the bodies in the street looking to see if one of them is Evael, but when he does not find her he returns to his home. He lights a candle by the window, which attracts a single butterfly to dance around it - this is a foreshadsowing of the coming of Evael as she is the bringer of the butterflies and thus also the plague - and drifts off to sleep. He wakes up the next morning to find the candle has burnt out. He leaves his home and once again journeys out into the woods looking for Evael.
III - "Evael 10:00"
The third and final chapter of the song begins as the man has spent yet another day looking for Evael but has not found her. When the night falls he returns to his town again and lights the candle by his window and goes to sleep. Just before he falls asleep he expresses his disappointment that the plague has taken the lives of everyone around him, but for some reason has left him alive despite his sadness. As he is sleeping he suddenly wakes up to a noise, which sounds like a faint knocking at his door and to find his house filled with butterflies. He goes to the door and opens it to find his beloved Evael standing at in his doorway. She falls into his arms barely alive, her eyes frozen from the many years she has lived in the woods. It is then that she reveals to the man that she had been lost in the woods and purposefully avoiding him because she was the original carrier of the plague and if she had returned to him, he would have become infected and died. Overcome with happiness that he at least gets to see her one final time before she dies, he tells her that it is okay and the two of them lay down together as the plague takes both their lives. They vanish and "the room is now filled with only butterflies". It is implied that both of them find peace in death, giving the story a bittersweet ending.

Psychology of reasoning

The psychology of reasoning is the study of how people reason, often broadly defined as the process of drawing conclusions to inform how people solve problems and make decisions. It is at the intersection of psychology, philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, logic, and probability theory.
Overview.
Psychological experiments on how humans and other animals reason have been carried out for over 100 years. An enduring question is whether or not people have the capacity to be rational. What does it mean to be rational? Current research in this area addresses various questions about reasoning, rationality, intelligence, relationships between emotion and reasoning, and development.
Everyday reasoning.
How do people reason about sentences in natural language? Most experimentation on deduction has been carried out on hypothetical thought, in particular, examining how people reason about conditionals, e.g., "If A then B". Participants in experiments make the modus ponens inference, given the indicative conditional "If A then B", and given the premise "A", they conclude "B". However, given the indicative conditional and the minor premise for the modus tollens inference, "not-B", about half of the participants in experiments conclude "not-A" and the remainder concludes that nothing follows. 
The ease with which people make conditional inferences is affected by content, as demonstrated in the well-known selection task developed by Peter Wason. Participants are better able to test a conditional that contains sensible content, e.g., "if the envelope is sealed then it must have a 50 cent stamp on it" compared to one that contains symbolic content, e.g.," if the letter is a vowel then the number is even". Background knowledge can also lead to the suppression of even the simple modus ponens inference Participants given the conditional "if Lisa has an essay to write then she studies late in the library" and the premise "Lisa has an essay to write " make the modus ponens inference 'she studies late in the library', but the inference is suppressed when they are also given a second conditional "if the library stays open then she studies late in the library". Interpretations of the suppression effect are controversial 
Other investigations of propositional inference examine how people think about disjunctive alternatives, e.g., "A or else B", and how they reason about negation, e.g., "It is not the case that A and B". Many experiments have been carried out to examine how people make relational inferences, including comparisons, e.g., "A is better than B". Such investigations also concern spatial inferences, e.g. "A is in front of B" and temporal inferences, e.g. "A occurs before B". Other common tasks include categorical syllogisms, used to examine how people reason about quantifiers such as "All" or "Some", e.g., "Some of the A are not B".
Theories of reasoning.
There are several alternative theories of the cognitive processes that human reasoning is based on. One view is that people rely on a mental logic consisting of formal (abstract or syntactic) inference rules similar to those developed by logicians in the propositional calculus. Another view is that people rely on domain-specific or content-sensitive rules of inference. A third view is that people rely on mental models, that is, mental representations that correspond to imagined possibilities. The mental model theory is the subject of the "mental models website" A fourth view is that people compute probabilities. 
One controversial theoretical issue is the identification of an appropriate competence model, or a standard against which to compare human reasoning. Initially classical logic was chosen as a competence model. Subsequently some researchers opted for non-monotonic logic and Bayesian probability. Research on mental models and reasoning has led to the suggestion that people are rational in principle but err in practice. Connectionist approaches towards reasoning have also been proposed.
Development of reasoning.
How does reasoning develop? Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development describes a sequence of stages in the development of reasoning from infancy to adulthood. According to the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, changes in reasoning with development come from increasing working memory capacity, increasing speed of processing, and enhanced executive functions and control. Increasing self-awareness is also an important factor.
Reasoning and intelligence.
How does reasoning relate to intelligence?
Different sorts of reasoning.
Psychologically, what are the relationships between induction, deduction, abduction, and analogy?

Mr Whoppit

Mr Whoppit was the teddy bear mascot of Donald Campbell, the land and water speed record holder. Writing in his 2011 book, "Donald Campbell: The Man Behind The Mask", journalist David Tremayne described Whoppit as Campbell's "magic talisman".
As was his father Sir Malcolm Campbell, Donald Campbell was highly superstitious. Both consulted spiritualist mediums and fortune tellers, Donald also placed his faith in a lucky mascot, Mr Whoppit. He refused to drive unless Whoppit was with him. One of his wife Tonia's tasks was to hand Whoppit to him on entering the cockpit. Whoppit was noted in 2003 by reporter Frank Bennett as being part of the "threesome" arriving for the 1964 record run the others being Campbell himself, and his wife. Bennett remarked that the mascot was in the cockpit each time, along with other memorabilia.
Whoppit was with Campbell during his serious crash during a land-speed record attempt at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1960, driving the Proteus Bluebird.
Campbell was killed during a record attempt on Coniston in 1967, while driving the jet hydroplane Bluebird K7. His body wasn't recovered, although Mr Whoppit floated free and was found almost immediately by Leo Villa. Campbell's body was finally located and recovered in 2001.
Campbell also named one of his dogs 'Whoppit'. Another teddy bear mascot was found as a 'wife' for Whoppit, named 'Mrs Whacko', who did not ride with Whoppit but stayed with Tonia and the pit crew.
Gar Wood and his brother George also kept teddy bears tied to their raceboat engines. 
Mr Whoppit's origins.
'Woppit' first appeared as a cartoon strip 'The story of Woppit' about a toy teddy bear, from the first issue of the comic Robin in 1953. In 1956, Merrythought manufactured a 9-inch tall Woppit bear wearing a red felt jacket and one of these was given to Donald by his close friend and manager Peter Barker.On joining the Bluebird team, Woppit acquired a miniature of their "Bluebird" patch sewn to his jacket, later followed by a one-piece flight suit. His name also changed slightly to 'Mr Whoppit'. In 1959, both Campbell and Mr Whoppit were photographed together in Robin.
In the late 1990s, Merrythought re-issued a limited production of 5,000 replicas of Mr Whoppit, with the original red jacket now sporting the Bluebird motif.
With Gina Campbell.
In later years, Donald's daughter Gina Campbell also adopted Whoppit as a mascot for her own water record-breaking attempts. These led to Whoppit's third high-speed crash.
In 1995 she offered him for auction, together with other Campbell memorabilia. He was to sell for about £60,000 but failed to reach the reserve and so remained in her possession. The decision to auction off Mr Whoppit was a cause of acrimony between Gina Campbell and Donald's widow Tonia Bern-Campbell, which re-surfaced again during the recovery of Bluebird in 2001.

Mitchell Plain

The Mitchell Plain is a karst area of relatively low relief. The extensive underlying cave system developed in Mississippian age limestone bedrock. Surface drainage is rare due to most streams in the area disappearing into caves or joints within the rock.
The limestone is a vestige of an early shallow cratonic sea that covered what would become Indiana, while the North-South linearity of the region is left over from the Cincinnati Uplift, sloping the rock layers from a high in the East sloping downward towards Cairo, Illinois. 
The Mitchell Plain is bound by the older Norman Upland on the East and the younger Crawford Upland on the West.

<doc id="19442770" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19442770" title="Linux user group">
Linux user group

A Linux User Group or Linux Users' Group (LUG) or GNU/Linux User Group (GLUG) is a private, generally non-profit or not-for-profit organization that provides support and/or education for Linux users, particularly for inexperienced users. The term commonly refers to local groups that meet in person, but is also used to refer to online support groups that may have members spread over a very wide area and which do not organize, or which are not based around, physical meetings. Many LUGs encompass FreeBSD and other free Unix-based operating systems.
Local LUGs.
Local Linux User Groups meet (typically weekly to monthly) to provide support and/or arrange and host presentations for Linux users, particularly for inexperienced users.
Given that Linux is not dominated by any specific corporate or institutional entity, LUG meetings typically encompass a broader range of topics than the meetings of other users' groups. Linux is predominantly user supported and some support is vastly easier via phone or in person than over e-mail or USENET. LUGs are still primarily focused on hobbyist users and professionals who are engaged in self-directed study.
SVLUG is among the oldest and largest LUGs. It was originally formed as a Special Interest Group for the Silicon Valley Computer Society, founded by Daniel Kionka to support Xenix and "low cost PC UNIX systems" (which later became focused on Linux as the dominant free implementation of Unix).
According to the Linux User Group HOWTO:
Typical activities.
LUGs typically meet once per month in facilities freely provided by universities, colleges, community centers, private corporations, or banquet rooms in restaurants. For example, the SVLUG of the Silicon Valley met for about 10 years in the back of a Carl's Jr. restaurant, and has met for the last several years in meeting rooms at Cisco Systems and, more recently, Symantec. Similarly, the BALUG (SF Bay Area LUG) has always met in a banquet room above the Four Seas Restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown.
Most LUGs are free, requiring no monthly or annual dues. In many cases the participants are encouraged to patronize the hosts (esp. in restaurant meetings, by buying dinner).
Some LUGs are informal conferences or round table discussions; members simply sit around and chat about Linux related topics. Some provide formal presentations. For example Linus Torvalds has occasionally talked to SVLUG or BALUG (which are close to his former home in Silicon Valley), and Hans Reiser (creator of ReiserFS) presented his early design plans at an SVLUG meeting. Presenters might be anyone in the community with something interesting to say. Occasionally, corporations will sponsor or encourage their employees to speak at users' groups to promote their products. LUGs generally require that these presentations provide technically interesting content rather than overt sales pitches. Often, LUG meetings provide an opportunity for members and guests to make announcements, especially for jobs offered and/or wanted, pleas for assistance (free or professional consulting), and hardware for sale or to be given away "to a good home".
LUGs in close geographic location would get together to hold conferences and share knowledge among peers. Like in Central America, in 2009, the first "Encuentro Centro Americano de Software Libre" was held in Nicaragua. Where LUGs from the region, from Belize to Panama attended. Groups from other countries are also invited. In 2010, it was held in Punta Renas, Nicaragua; where there were members from the region, including from Germany and Mexico. In 2011, it will be held in El Salvador. These events usually take place in summer, as most of the LUG members are students.
Many LUGs also organize installfests (FreeBSD groups tend to refer to them as "installathons") which are opportunities for experienced Linux users to help others, especially novices with installation and configuration of Linux systems. Installfests may also have break out sessions for teaching new tips and tricks—performance tuning, security hardening, etc.
A few LUGs have developed projects of regional or even international stature. For example, the Uganda Linux User Group operates in 3 major cities and frequently coordinates national and international events which have featured guests as high-profile as Tim Berners-Lee. The Bellingham Linux Users Group (BLUG), in Bellingham, Washington, holds the annual Linuxfest Northwest, which attracts large numbers of participants from throughout the region, including Western Canada. Likewise, Bellevue Linux Users Group (BELUG), which meets in a bookstore in Bellevue, Washington, has developed The Linux Information Project (LINFO), a comprehensive online resource that receives hundreds of thousands of hits monthly from around the world.
LUGs sometimes are gifted with surplus books, back issues of Linux magazines, copies of CDs and other promotional items to give away to their members.
Other than these "official" LUG activities the meetings provide opportunities for users to socialize. Members often exchange e-mail addresses, URLs, and phone numbers and provide technical support or collaborate on study or development projects together. Some local LUGs share characteristics of online LUGs, meeting on IRC or hosting support mailing lists in addition to the physical meetings. LUGs may also have an online blog presence, an example is the OSU LUG or the Nottingham LUG whose Planet NottsLUG is an aggregation of various members' blogs.
LUGs can also be a natural place for local organizations to find Linux expertise. Professors for Unix classes at San Jose State University came to SVLUG in the early days of Linux to find guest lecturers for their classes; some LUGs provide computer help to schools and non-profit organizations, and perform other community outreach services.
Installfests.
An Installfest (a portmanteau of "installation" and "festival") is an event, generally sponsored by a local Linux User Group, university or LAN party, at which people get together to do mass installations of computer operating systems or software, most often Linux and other open source software. 
It is generally an advocacy and community-building event, where novices bring their computers along with their preferred operating system installation disks to the location of the installfest, and experienced users help them in getting started and troubleshooting problems. Sometimes a Linux distribution and informative flyers are given for free to the attendees. Some events ask for participants to bring power strips and network switches if available.
Installfests welcome all skill levels from complete novice to expert. An installfest will range from an informal get together to festivals involving music. The tone and scope of a specific event will depend on the organization sponsoring it. Writing in the BBC's "Internet Blog" in 2008, George Wright described a mini-installfest as being "as painless as imagined" and "[with a bit of luck, it can be straightforward". 
The Ubuntu Global Jam includes installfests.
Simultaneous installfests in many Latin American cities are coordinated annually through FLISOL.
Hackfests.
A Hackfest (a portmanteau of "hack" and "festival") is an event, generally sponsored by a local Linux User Group, university or LAN party, at which people get together to demonstrate security issues or reverse engineer computer operating systems or software, most often Linux and other open source software.
SFD.
Local LUGs celebrate Software Freedom Day by going out and promoting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Free Ubuntu CDs are given out along with brochures and any information about FOSS. This event is commonly held on the third Saturday of September.
Online LUGs.
Not all online Linux support groups refer to themselves as "a LUG", and the use of the word is sometimes (as in the Linux User Group HOWTO) intended to specifically refer to groups of Linux users which organize regular meetings. However, the LUG indexes list groups with members over a large geographical area, and over time, organizations like the EU LUG, for Linux users throughout the European Union (, apparently defunct) use the term LUG to refer to themselves.
Online LUGs use mailing lists, bulletin boards and IRC as their primary method of communication, with members meeting physically seldom or not at all. As with local LUGs, some groups are limited to technical discussions and others seek to form social bonds between Linux users by having "chat" or "off topic" forums.
Reasons for forming or joining an online LUG vary. Some members of online LUGs may be relatively isolated without a local LUG accessible or with only a few other Linux users in their area.
Women in Libre software communities.
Some Linux users are dissatisfied with their local LUG for reasons that might include its size, insularity or atmosphere: the online group LinuxChix, which is a worldwide LUG and social group for women Linux users, was founded due to the perceived aggression and rudeness prevalent in other Linux forums. The potential member base of an online LUG, as with other online support groups, make them suitable for people seeking help with more obscure or difficult problems. Some Linux users are part of both a local LUG and an online LUG.
An EC funded study (2006) summarized in the Flosspols report, indicates that about 1.5% of FLOSS community members were female, compared with 28% in proprietary software. The Ubuntu Census Survey (June 2006) also reflects a similar female ratio with 2.4% women actively volunteering in the Ubuntu community.

Passang Lhamo is a Tibetan nun, activist, and singer.
Lhamo, a Tibetan Buddhist, was ordained as a nun at age 14. According to the Tibet government in exile, on 25 May 1994, Lhamo, along with four other nuns, went to Lhasa to shout slogans and to protest over the PRC rule. They were imprisoned by the police and placed in the notorious Drapchi Prison in November 1994 along with 13 other nuns to serve a five-year sentence, charged with endangering state security. The CTA claims in April 1996 all the inmates of Unit 3 of Drapchi prison, consisting of nearly 100 female political prisoners, went on a hunger strike in protest of the harsh treatment they believed they were receiving in Drapchi. The week long strike caused the prison officers some concern that it might damage the reputation of the prison further if the inmates died as a result. They promised an end to the brutality.
Lhamo was eventually set free on 24 May 1999, after five full years in Drapchi. She briefly returned to Penpo, but fled in exile to Dharamsala in India where she now serves as a nun at the Ganden Choeling Nunnery, near the monastery and residence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. 
Since, she has done much towards the cause of Tibetan independence, including numerous performances singing at various traditional festivals in the United States and Canada.

Music video.
Korean and English MV.
The music video begins with Park Jin-Young performing a Motown-style concert with the Wonder Girls as his backup singers. After the show, a couple of record executives give Park sheet lyrics to the song "Nobody", which he prepares to debut on his next show.
Minutes before his show begins, Park is in the men's restroom using a toilet stall when he realizes that there is no toilet paper available. As he frantically calls for help, everyone on stage begins to wonder where he is as the show starts. The executives then motion the Wonder Girls to bring their microphone stands forward and take center stage. At the end of their performance, Park finally appears on stage to congratulate the group for their performance. While the song plays, the video becomes a montage of the group's career progressing to superstardom.
At the end of the video, Park enters another toilet stall and sees that there is toilet paper available. Unfortunately for him, he pulls the last sheet off the dispenser and once again has to call for help.
Japanese.
The PV begins with Sohee holding a newspaper "The New York Lines" with the "wonderful" Wonder Girls as the front cover and an article titled "Nobody, the worldwide hit". Sohee in white shades folds the newspaper. Then, it reveals that the Wonder Girls are in an airplane. The screen pans from left to right, showing the members in neon dresses: Sunye in green, Hyelim in blue, Yoobin in orange, Yeeun in yellow, and Sohee in pink. As the airplane side slides down, the member walk out from the stairs to be greeted by paparazzi. The girls walk past the paparazzi forward to a stage. The back of the stage slides closed. Yoobin begins with "it'll never change" and the song begins with the girls dancing with their microphone stands. After Sohee's second verse and during Yeeun's chorus, it pans out to show a black-and-white TV showing the Nobody music video. A family is watching and dancing to Nobody in one room and switches to another room with two ladies dancing along. The TV is zoomed in to see the girls in changed dresses and hairstyles. The girls are in upgraded golden dresses similar to the ones in their 2008 version. The stage changed to have a live band, a pianist to the left, and four background singers to the right. The song continues with Yeeun and Sunye sharing the chorus leading to Yeeun's high note, then Sunye's ad libs. The song ends with Yoobin's rap and a pose with the microphones.
Charts and reception.
In September 2008, the single sold 28,160 digital copies in United States. It is the first K-pop song ever to enter the US Billboard Hot 100.
"Nobody" went No. 1 on KBS' "Music Bank" program in early October, then remained there for four consecutive weeks. The song also won Cyworld's "Song of the Month" award in September and October 2008, giving them a total of five "Song of the Month" awards, tying Big Bang.
At the 2008 MKMF Awards, "Nobody" won awards for "Song of the Year" and "Best Music Video".

1927–28 Boston Bruins season

The 1927–28 Boston Bruins season was the team's fourth in the NHL. The Bruins finished first in the American Division, marking its first division title in franchise history and its second playoff appearance. The team lost in the playoffs to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers.
Regular season.
For the second straight season, Harry Oliver led the Bruins in scoring, and although the team's attack was relatively anemic - the Bruins finished with 77 goals, leading only the last-place teams in both divisions, the Chicago Black Hawks and the New York Americans - they cut down sharply in goals allowed, leading the division behind Hal Winkler's goaltending. Eddie Shore was the team's great star, finishing just one point behind Oliver in scoring and leading the league in penalty minutes by a wide margin. 
Winkler in his own turn had fifteen shutouts, tied with Alex Connell for the league lead and a new NHL record; Winkler's mark remains the Bruins' single-season record for shutouts, eighty years later. Although veteran Sprague Cleghorn was fading and missed a quarter of the season with injuries, Shore and defense partner Lionel Hitchman were ironmen, playing most of each game.
Prominent newcomers included Dutch Gainor and Dit Clapper, both of whose rights were purchased from the minor leagues, and who would make a significant impact with the Bruins down the years.
With Boston's first place finish, the Bruins became the first team to win the Prince of Wales Trophy, awarded for the first time in this season.
Playoffs.
The Bruins gained a first-round bye by virtue of winning the division, and played the New York Rangers in the second round in a two-game, total goal series. Their scoring problems of the regular season continued, exacerbated by a flu bug going through the dressing room and various minor injuries; Shore, Clapper, Gainor and Connor were particularly affected. 
Boston tied the first game 1-1 in New York, the Rangers' final home game of the playoffs - this was the first of perennial disruptions to the Rangers' playoff schedule due to Madison Square Garden hosting the circus in the spring. The Bruins lost the second match in Boston 4-1, on three Ranger third-period goals as the weakened Brown-and-Gold folded at last, to drop the total-goal series five goals to two. Harry Oliver, who scored a goal in each game, was the sole offensive threat.

Advertising to children

Advertising to children is the act of marketing or advertising products or services to children, as defined by national legislation and advertising standards. It is often the subject of debate, relating to the alleged influence on children’s consumption. Laws concerning such advertisements have largely evolved in recent years. In most countries, advertising for children is framed by a mix of legislation and advertising self-regulation.
Scope and form.
Advertising to children can take place on traditional media – television, radio and print – as well as new media (internet and other electronic media). Packaging, in-store advertising, event sponsorship, and promotions can also be used.
UNESCO – the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization – defines early childhood as ages 0–8 years. For the purposes of advertising law, the definition of a child varies from one jurisdiction to another. However, the age of 12 is commonly used as a cut-off point, on the basis of the widespread academic view that by age 12 children have developed their behaviour as consumers, effectively recognise advertising and are able to adopt critical attitudes towards it.
According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, food and beverage companies (44 companies reporting to the FTC) in the U.S. spent approximately $1.6 billion in 2006 to promote their products and services to children.
Legislation.
In the United Kingdom, Greece, Denmark, and Belgium advertising to children is restricted, and in Quebec, Sweden and Norway advertising to children under the age of 12 is illegal.
The European Union also has framework legislation in place which sets down minimum provisions on advertising to children for its 27 member states. The EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive, due to replace the Television Without Frontiers Directive in all member states by the end of 2009, sets out several EU-wide rules on advertising and children:
Advertising shall not cause moral or physical detriment to minors, and shall therefore comply with the following criteria for their protection:
In addition:
Note that criterion (b) explicitly outlaws appeals to "pester power".
In the United States the Federal Trade Commission studied the issue of advertising to children in the 1970s but decided against regulation.
Advertising standards.
In many countries worldwide, advertising is also governed by self-regulatory codes of conduct. Advertisers, advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards – a set of ethical and behavioural rules they commit to respecting – which is enforced by a Self-regulatory organization, often an independent industry-funded body, responsible for drafting, amending and enforcing the code. Self-regulatory organizations for advertising are increasingly following the best practice model agreed with regulators and consumer and public health groups in Europe. At a minimum, the general aim of self-regulatory codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful', but in most countries detailed rules are in place for different advertising techniques and sectors.
Advertising self-regulation is built on different levels. On a global level, the International Chamber of Commerce has drafted a global code on marketing communications. All forms of marketing communications worldwide must conform to the ICC Consolidated Code on Advertising and Marketing. The code includes a specific section, detailing the special care needed when communicating with children.
Since 2006, a global code of practice on food marketing communications is also in place. The Framework for Responsible Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Marketing Communications of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) sets down global requirements for food and beverage marketing communications on all media, including the Internet. Key provisions include: the need for substantiation for claims or health benefits; no encouragement of excess consumption; no representation of snacks as meals; no undermining of healthy lifestyle messages; no undermining of the role of parents.
These codes provide a minimum requirement for marketing communications worldwide. National self-regulatory codes, based on the ICC codes, are established, policed and enforced by local Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) and industry in over 100 countries and apply to a range of media, increasingly also including digital marketing communications. The ICC and national codes are reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain relevant to local, cultural and consumer concerns and that they promote best practice. The ICC Framework is applicable globally but is a minimum standard designed to be adapted and transposed into SR codes at national level. Many countries have implemented SR provisions that use the ICC Framework as a basis, but go further in several respects, depending on local considerations. Examples include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK and the USA.
In the United States the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) established in 1974 by the National Advertising Review Council (NARC) runs a self-regulatory program that includes a prescreening service for advertisers to ensure they are in compliance with COPPA and the CARU guidelines.
In addition to industry-wide self-regulation, individual companies and industry sectors have introduced a wide range of additional provisions relating to marketing communications directed at children. For example, most multinational food and beverage companies have developed their own policies on food and beverage marketing communications to children and, most recently, have announced the joint implementation of these individual commitments.
In July 2007, 10 of these companies (now 13) announced a common pledge in the US – the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, mirroring a similar initiative by 15 companies in Canada – the Canadian Children’s Food & Beverage Advertising Initiative; and followed by 11 companies in Europe with the EU Pledge. Under these initiatives, participating companies will cease advertising to children under 12, other than products that meet specific nutritional guidelines, based on international scientific recommendations. A similar Pledge programme was launched by leading food companied in Thailand in May 2008 and in Australia in mid-2009.
Media literacy.
Media literacy is a relatively new discipline, aimed at teaching individuals and children in particular to understand and use the media to their advantage. Media literacy is increasingly recognised by governments and international organisations such as the European Union and the World Health Organisation as a key tool to help children understand and deal with today’s complex media environment. Media literacy programs are based around the need to “make children engage in media rather than solely consume it”.
MediaSmart is an established media literacy education program focused on advertising. Launched in November 2002, MediaSmart is a non-profit media literacy program for school children aged 6 to 11 years old. MediaSmart develops and provides, free of charge and on request, educational materials to primary schools that teach children to think critically about advertising in the context of their daily lives. MediaSmart materials use real examples of advertising to teach core media literacy skills. MediaSmart is funded by the advertising business in the UK and is supported by the UK government and EU institutions. Since 2002, MediaSmart has been launched in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Portugal and Hungary.

63rd Parachute Battalion

The 63rd Parachute Battalion ( tr. 63. Padobranski bataljon) is one of the battalions constituting the Special Brigade of the Serbian Army. It used to be of brigade-size, but it has the status of a battalion within the restructured Serbian Army. It is intended for special, reconnaissance and diversionary operations deep behind enemy lines.
Competences.
When the competences of the 63rd Paratroop Battalion members are analyzed, the point to underscore is the safety coefficient of parachutist training, a parameter which, in spite of several tens of thousands of dives made in the last 15 years, is by far better than the comparable safety indicates for parachute units of the world's most powerful armies. This speaks for the high training standards and competence of the parachutists and a high degree of safety in training. In turn this suggests that strong work discipline, excellent abilities of officers and parachute instructors, highest-quality psycho-physical and expert coaching of the men, thorough checkups and perfect condition of parachute accessories, together with high morale of individual and units, reduce risk.
History.
The first parachute jump in Yugoslavia was taken at the Novi Sad Airport on 2 September 1926. Second Lieutenant Dragutin Dolanski was dropped from an altitude of 650 meters (2100 feet). The year 1938 was particularly significant for the Yugoslav parachuting, since that was when the First International Aircraft Exhibition was staged in Belgrade. The Exhibition at the Zemun Airport included a combined jump of 10 parachutists, including Katarina Matanović, the first and only woman parachutist in Yugoslavia prior to the 1941 war.The Yugoslav Army had realized the significance of parachute units, and a school of parachuting was opened at Pančevo on 1 October 1939. The School was moved to Novi Sad in 1941, where it remained stationed until the outbreak of the war, whence a move to Niš was scheduled. The fate of the School of Parachuting in the April War has not yet been ascertained. In the Second World War, paratroop raids had a significant role in almost all major military operations. In mid-1944, the Supreme Headquarters requested help from the Allies to form a parachute unit. After the transfer of the Supreme Headquarters to the Island of Vis, urgent orders to lower-level commands were delivered by parachuted messengers.
In September 1944, a hundred troops were taken to Bari, Italy, for a parachuting training course. Another hundred volunteers were selected for training from among the wounded soldiers recovering in Italy. The training and drops from airplanes took place in a training centre at Gravina. The School of Parachuting was successfully completed by 191 troops and officers. After completion of the training course on 14 October 1944, the First Parachute Battalion was formed, with Lieutenant Čedomir Vranić appointed its commander. The 1st Parachute Battalion recruits also underwent diversionary training, topography and target-shooting courses, and had intensive live-ammunition shooting practice. The Allies supplied the Battalion with complete weaponry and materiel (except for parachutes). In December 1944, the Battalion was shipped to Dubrovnik. On 6 January 1945, the Battalion arrived in Belgrade. This elite Battalion had had no combat experience during the Second World War. In mid-July 1945, the 1st Parachute Battalion was disbanded.
Apart from Italy, a number of Yugoslav paratroops were trained in the USSR during the Second World War. Upon return to the country, they were integrated into the existing parachute units. In the 1946-1950 period, a parachute training course was operative under the Air Force Command. In 1946, on the order of the Supreme Headquarters, the 46th Parachute Battalion was formed at Bela Crkva. In 1948, the Battalion was relocated to Novi Sad. Because of the threat of potential invasion from the east, the Battalion was again relocated, this time to Mostar, in January 1951. The Battalion remained stationed at Mostar until 1954, when it was transferred back to Novi Sad and combined with the newly formed 63rd Parachute Brigade. In 1952, the 46th Parachute Battalion was divided into two parts. One part remained at Mostar, and the other was transferred to Šabac. Out of this part the new 63rd Parachute Battalion was formed. By Order No. 200 of the Armed Forces Supreme Command (VKOS) of 5 February 1953, the 63rd Parachute Brigade was formed at Šabac. The Brigade was relocated to Novi Sad in March 1954 thanks to more agreeable circumstances. Considerable errors have been committed in the understanding of this unit's use and combat tasks. The prevailing position was that the Yugoslav People's Army(JNA) did not need larger parachute units, as, presumably, battlefield drops from the air had no chance of success in a nuclear war and with modern anti-aircraft defence and mass armoured vehicles in use. On the order of the JNA General Headquarters, the 63rd Parachute Brigade was dismissed in late 1959, and out of it 3 independent parachute battalions were formed: 159th Parachute Battalion in Skopje; 127th Parachute Battalion at Batajnica; and 148th Parachute Battalion at Cerklje. In 1964, a Parachute Training Centre was formed by combining the 159th and 127th Parachute Battalions in Niš. The 63rd Parachute Brigade was once more formed on 5 December 1967 by combining the Parachute Training Centre and the 148th Parachute Battalion. From 1967 on, the 63rd Parachute Brigade has been stationed in Niš. The Parachute Brigade recruits have participated in numerous parachuting and other domestic and international sports events, where they achieved enviable results.
Training.
In addition to being a highest-rank combat unit of this type in the Military of Serbia, the 63rd Paratroop Battalion is a unique "military school of parachuting". The "paras" are training experts on land also; they have an excellent knowledge of the mountain and its whims, of the plains, rivers and lakes, inhabited areas, communications and facilities of particular importance, in short, all the situations they may find themselves in both in peace and war. Sorties behind enemy front lines - reconnoitering and diversions - are their trademark.
Recent services.
In all the crises of the postwar era, the 63rd Paratroop Battalion has always been the first deployed, with the highest degree of combat readiness. In the course of armed conflicts in the territory of the former SFR Yugoslavia, the Battalion carried out all the assignments honourably, protecting all airports it had been assigned to. During the 1999 NATO war on Yugoslavia, the members of the 63rd Battalion fought against the KLA fighters in Kosovo, but also with diversionary detachments attempting raids from Albania on the territory of Yugoslavia. Members of the 63rd Battalion particularly excelled in their duty during an operation near the Yugoslav-Albanian border.
Overview.
From the forming of the Brigade until today, the paras have participated in 250 major combined tactical maneuvers, carried out with notable success. In the 1947-1990 period, 330,000 parachute dives had been taken, and from 1990 until now over 10,000 drops have been made each year. The 63rd Parachute Battalion earned the repute of one of the best units thanks to the exceptional efforts on the part of the troops and officers and high marks obtained in combined maneuvers.
The unit says its basic values are love of the fatherland and freedom, soldier's and parachutist's oaths, preservation of the honour of the arms, individual and collective courage, and unbreakable comradeship. The 63rd has been awarded many recognitions which its members and command cadre are proud of: the Order of the National Hero adorning our wartime banner, six Orders of Courage, and over a hundred other orders and medals awarded the 63rd Brigade members for participation in combat and other missions. Forty-six of its troops have given their lives while on parachuting and other missions.
The 63rd Parachute Battalion is a world-renowned and honoured unit. It also trains foreign armed forces in parachutist skills. The Battalion has been visited by many foreign delegations, which have assured themselves of the abilities and valor of the parachutists - their country's elite soldiers.
The unit distinguishes itself by a high degree of loyalty to it by its former and present members.

Sherburne Pass

Sherburne Pass, or Shelburne Pass, is a mountain pass in the Green Mountains of Vermont, between Pico Peak to the south and Deer Leap Mountain to the north. 
The height of land of the pass is located in the town of Killington, while its western ascent begins in the town of Mendon.
On the east side, the pass drains into Kent Brook, thence into the Ottauquechee River, the Connecticut River, and into Long Island Sound in Connecticut. 
To the west, the pass drains via Mendon Brook, then East Creek, into Otter Creek, thence into Lake Champlain. Lake Champlain drains into the Richelieu River in Québec, thence into the Saint Lawrence River, and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. 
Pico Mountain, part of Killington Ski Resort since December 1997, is on the south side of Sherburne Pass, with a ski lift running from Rte. 4 to the summit of Pico Peak. 
The Long Trail (LT), a hiking trail, runs the length of Vermont from Massachusetts to Québec along the spine of the Green Mountains, crossing U.S. Route 4 about half a mile west of the height of Sherburne Pass. The Appalachian Trail (AT), a National Scenic Trail from Georgia to Maine, is contiguous with the LT to the south of the pass. The AT diverges from the LT about a mile north of Rt. 4 at Maine Junction — northwest of Deer Leap Mtn. in Willard Gap — and runs east to New Hampshire and the White Mountains. The AT and LT formerly crossed Rt. 4 at the height of Sherburne Pass, and split on the east side of Deer Leap Mountain. Until 1999, the trails passed east of the summit of Pico Peak, along the contour. Both were moved to the west slope of the mountain. The old route of the AT/LT is now a blue-blazed trail, named the Sherburne Pass Trail.

Gaden Choeling Nunnery or Ganden Choeling is a Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in Dharamshala, India. It is near the monastery in which His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama resides.
The Gaden Choeling Nunnery was started by nuns who fled from the Nechung Ri Nunnery in Tibet, destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.
It is the largest and oldest Tibetan nunnery in India.
Since most of the nunneries in Tibet are no longer operational, it may be the largest in the world.
The nunnery is built on a steep hillside in Dharamshala.
The nunnery is only a ten-minute walk from the main temple in McLeodGanj. As of 1999 there were almost 150 nuns in residence.

The Sour Notes

The Sour Notes are an American independent rock band.
Based in Austin, Texas, The Sour Notes consists of members Jared Boulanger, Amarah Ulghani, Jessica June Kim, Courtney Howell & Erin Howell. They are known for experimenting in many different music genres, accompanied by female guest-vocalists.
History.
The Sour Notes formed initially as the moniker for singer-songwriter Jared Boulanger's solo recording project while living in Houston, Texas. Upon finishing what would later be his debut album "The Meat of the Fruit" in 2008, Boulanger asked long-time friend Chris Page to join him in creating a performing band in Austin. There, they met drummer Travis Hackett and bassist Brandi Dipietro through mutual friends and after having played only eight shows together, recorded their second album, "Received in Bitterness".
In Winter 2009, the band hit the road on their first East Coast tour just before releasing 7-inch single "Never Mix, Never Worry", which displayed a new direction for The Sour Notes' characteristically evolving sound. Later that year, bassist Brandi Dipietro left the band and keyboardist Elaine Greer joined the band during the recording of their third album, "It's Not Gonna Be Pretty", which was released in January 2010 to much critical acclaim. Following a two-week tour in support of the album, The Sour Notes were selected as an official showcasing artist at the 2010 SXSW Music Festival, opening for We Are Scientists at the Official SXSWi Closing Party and Daniel Johnston's only Austin, Texas show that summer.
The band spent a majority of 2010 touring with new members Amarah Ulghani, Kelly DeWitt, Erin Mikulenka and Taylor Steinberg, playing over 60 shows in and around the US that year, including the Free Press Summer Fest in Houston, Pitter Patter Fest in Toronto and the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. At the turn of 2011, The Sour Notes released 7-inch single "Hot Pink Flares" and their fourth album "Last Looks", which featured orchestral-pop band Mother Falcon, who performed on the album. The band then set out on another East Coast tour and were invited to play at the 35 Conferette in Denton and the 2011 NXNE Music Festival in Toronto.
2012 brought the release of split 7-inch record "Wait//White" on DIY label No Play Music with fellow Austin band Marmalakes and the U.S. television series "Shameless" featured The Sour Notes songs "Do-ers & Say-ers" and "One Fell Swoop" during its second season premiere on Showtime. The band added guitarist Rene Chavez and drummer Justin Selman and were again selected as official artists for SXSW and NXNE 2012. That summer, the band re-released their remixed/remastered fourth album, "Last Looks" on vinyl and toured the East Coast with new members Jessica June Kim and Courtney & Erin Howell.
In March 2013, The Sour Notes we're first round picks at SXSW and played 8 shows in Austin during the festival. In June, the band released cassingle "In The Meanwhile", followed by a brief East Coast tour in support of their unreleased fifth album "Do What May". Based on fan voting, The Sour Notes we're selected to open for The Dandy Warhols as a part of Red Bull's Sound Select program in Austin that Summer.

Selective retention

Selective retention, in relating to the mind, is the process when people more accurately remember messages that are closer to their interests, values and beliefs, than those that are in contrast with their values and beliefs, selecting what to keep in the memory, narrowing the informational flow.
Such examples could include:
Outside of the theory of memory and mind: Selective retention may also be retaining of contractual agreements upon moving on in open politics or of physical phenotypes in eugenic methods of propagation of traits and features of a genome. Among other fields where action can impose a strata of creative limitation.

1973 Individual Speedway World Championship

The 1973 Individual Speedway World Championship.
The 1973 World Final was won by Polish rider Jerzy Szczakiel following a run-off in with defending champion Ivan Mauger after both riders had finished on 13 points. On the second lap of the run-off, Mauger fell in turn 3 after trying a risky passing move leaving Szczakiel to win easily. Another Polish rider, Zenon Plech finished third. Rank outsider Szczakiel, who had finished last with no points scored in his only other World Final appearance in 1971, rode the meeting of his life and was only beaten in his final two rides before defeating Mauger in the run-off.
The final, held at the Silesian Stadium in Chorzów, Poland, was held in front of the largest crowd in world speedway history, estimated to be around 130,000.
Controversy.
The Final was surrounded by controversy, with decisions made by Georg Traunspurger, the referee assigned to the meeting by the FIM, seeming to openly favour the Polish riders in an attempt to have a home town win and more than one Polish rider on the podium, although Jerzy Szczakiel's form on the day did not require the referee's help. One of his decisions was to have 2nd reserve Andrzej Wyglenda of Poland race in Heat 16 in front of 1st reserve Tommy Jansson of Sweden (after Bernt Persson of Sweden was unable to ride), making it 4 Polish riders in the race. The race itself also had people talking as second placed Edward Jancarz, who led for the first three laps, seemed to let Zenon Plech take the lead in the final turn, allowing Plech, who had more points at that stage of the meeting, to collect another 3 points for the win.
However, by far his most controversial decision was to exclude Soviet rider Gregory Khlynovski from Heat 19. Khlynovski had attempted to pass Zenon Plech for the lead going into the back straight of the last lap. As he was passed by the Russian, Plech lost control of his bike and fell. Despite protests from riders and the Soviet officials, after speaking to him via the pit phone the referee simply took Plech's word that Khlynovski had knocked him off his bike. He did not take into account any eye witness reports and excluded Khlynovski, resulting in the Russian officials walking out in disgust. England's Peter Collins, who was in 3rd place at the time of the crash, was awarded the heat win, Plech, who didn't actually finish the race, was awarded 2nd, while another Russian, Valery Gordeev, was awarded third place even though he did not finish the race either after hitting Plech's fallen bike. In a show of good sportsmanship, Collins gave the fallen Plech a ride back to the pits on the back of his bike.
The result of the two points he gained for second place allowed Plech to finish a clear third in the championship. The ruling, with Khlynovski excluded, should have seen Collins as the only rider to score from the heat, with both Plech and Gordeev scoring no points after failing to finish. This would have resulted in Plech only finishing the championship on 10 points and in 5th place. Had Khlynovski been the winner of the heat as many believe he should have been, including many of the riders in the meeting, he would have ended on 13 points, which would have put him in the run-off for the title with Szczakiel and Mauger.
British television commentator Dave Lanning called the ruling ""The craziest piece of speedway regulations in the history of World Championship racing"", before adding that ""It seems to me that the authorities here in Katowice are making up the rules to suit themselves to get their boys a world title.""
It had been reported and long believed that the referee of the meeting was Polish. However, the official program of the meeting names Georg Traunspurger as being from West Germany.

Gabonese parliamentary election, 1964

Parliamentary elections were held in Gabon on 12 April 1964. The election was originally to be held the week of an abortive coup d'état, though Gabonese president Leon M'ba of the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG) dissolved the National Assembly and rescheduled them for 12 April. Despite widespread lack of free speech and M'ba's intimidation of voters, the opposition still garnered 46 percent of the vote.
Electoral process.
The election was originally to be held the week of an abortive coup d'état, though M'ba dissolved the National Assembly and rescheduled them for 12 April. Upon insistence of the French, M'ba allowed opposition candidates to run, which it claimed was the main reason for starting the coup in the first place. However, their leaders were barred from participating because of their involvement in the coup, and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes. Severe electoral irregularities were reported.
France closely followed the election, deporting a Peace Corps teacher. Their military still maintained a presence there, which may have been an intimidation of voters. Further, they distributed leaflets and supported M'ba by other means. The Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) practically disappeared from the political scene, as many of its leaders had been jailed because of the coup, and M'ba's opposition was composed of parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. The two major factions of this were the one who supported Aubame and one who was headed by a trade union leader
Nevertheless, the opposition garnered 44% of the vote and 16 of 47 seats in the assembly, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats. The opposition disputed this, and held strikes across the country, though these did not have a sizable impact on business.

Darland High School

Darland High School is a mixed, non-denominational high school in Rossett, Wales, established in 1958. Its current head teacher is Peter Ronald Agnew.
History.
1958 - 1971.
Darland High School opened in September 1958 for 234 pupils, 10 members of staff and the headmaster, Glyn Bellis. The school cost £96,000 and was completed in just 18 months. It was reported that the school would "play a vital part in the development of horticulture and market gardening pursuits, for many of the pupils come from the strawberry-growing district of Holt". During that first year the school grounds were enhanced with flower beds laid out under the direction of J. Elwy Williams. The official opening ceremony took place on 9 June 1959, in a whole school celebratory assembly.
Throughout the years, Darland has welcomed many visitors. In 1959, the school was honoured with a visit from Chiefs Zulu and Putranali of Tanzania who presented Bellis with a 'beautiful skin'. Unfortunately, the health risk posed by the fleas outweighed the hospitality of these gentlemen and the skin had to be burnt when they had departed. In 1966, the school was visited by the Christian missionary Gladys Aylward, whose life was the subject of the 1958 film "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness".
A small school, Darland soon gained both national and international attention, as the work done in the Rural Studies department merited a programme on BBC television and a visit from the first television gardener, Percy Thrower, in 1971. In the same year, the Darland School bee keeping group appeared on the BBC programme "Young Scientists of the Year".
1972 - 2001.
In 1972, Darland became a comprehensive school, leading to a massive increase in pupils and staff. An extensive building programme accompanied the arrival of hundreds of new children and many new staff. In 1977, Bellis retired and was replaced in January 1978 by Darland's second headteacher, Derrick Gwilliam. Gwilliam and his staff not only consolidated but increased the academic and extra-curricular activity at Darland. In 1983, Darland's Silver Jubilee was celebrated with a variety of events. To commemorate the occasion, pupils produced a time capsule, containing a collection of essays, photographs, coins, stamps, and newspapers. In June 1987, the music suite was built, and the time capsule was buried in the floor of the new suite and remains there to this day.
In 1987-88, Darland featured on the BBC's "Q.E.D.", as it was at the centre of trials for vitamin tablets which claimed to boost children's IQ levels. In September 1995, the then Welsh Secretary William Hague visited Darland School to launch the Conservative Government's 'Young People and Sport in Wales' campaign. The aim was to increase the number of young people taking part in sport activities by the year 2000.
The school has had a long tradition of sporting achievement having won numerous trophies and produced some fine athletes. In December 1996, Darland Sports Centre was opened by Mr Andrew Marriot of Wrexham Football Club. Andrew Marriot unveiled a plaque commemorating the opening. In December 1996, Gwilliam retired, and was replaced by the third headteacher, Chris Hughes. In 2001, the school won recognition in The Guinness Book of Records for the World's Biggest Hug, in an event that brought together a huge cross-section of the local population.
2004 - present.
In September 2004, Darland welcomed the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly, Rhodri Morgan, who unveiled a plaque in memory of the miners who lost their lives in the 1934 Gresford disaster. Another commemorative event was held in June 2005 to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. Pupils hosted a VE Day style party for veterans of the war and recorded interviews on the BBC's Wartime Memories website.
In February 2009, Darland received a visit from Jane Hutt, the Minister for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills. The Welsh Assembly Government had allocated in excess of £5,000,000 for the refurbishment of three Wrexham high schools and Darland was to be included. This year also saw the arrival of the FA Cup trophy. Darland was the only school in Wrexham that the FA Cup visited, and every pupil had the opportunity to have their photograph taken with it. Henry Olonga, the international Zimbabwean cricketer, also visited in 2009. He shared his knowledge with some of Darland cricket players, and gave a speech about the demise of democracy in Zimbabwe and the importance of grasping every opportunity and making the most of education. The climax of 2009 was the 50th anniversary celebrations of the school, attended by pupils and staff past and present. The close of the school term saw the retirement of Chris Hughes. Peter Agnew, from Flint High School, was appointed as the fourth headteacher of Darland.
In 2012 a BBC documentary was aired about maths prodigy Cameron Tompson featuring the school.

Reviews.
The Daily Telegraph (London):
""Andrei Diev gave a dazzling recital of works, ranging from neglected sonatas by Soler to dances by Schubert, from Prokofiev to Messiaen. Mr. Diev has a wide interpretive range. He knows how to give Prokofiev's Sixth its acerbic edge and its contrasting melodic warmth, as well. Liszt's arrangements of Schubert were perfectly poised and wonderfully buoyant. Enthralling throughout.""
The Chronicle (England):
""Mr. Diev's brilliance could only be marveled at. He is one of the best in the world.""
L'Informateur (France):
""Andrei Diev is a pianist of great magnitude. His talent is the embodiment of the transcendental potential of art. His remarkable technique is aimed at revealing the secret of music.""
""He plays, transformed by that which opens up to him beyond the boundaries of the notes, clearly revealing to us this secret without the least bit of falseness or demagoguery. He merges with the soul of the music and with the soul of the composer. Andrei Diev is a great pianist.""
La Stampa (Italy):
""The solo part was played by an extraordinary interpreter, Andrei Diev, who demonstrated a magnificent technique and admirable musicality. Diev presented a marvelous reading; powerful and expressive, energetic and elegant, complete with a wonderful sensitivity to the breath of the musical phrase.""

Gerf Hussein

The temple of Gerf Hussein was originally a partly free-standing, and partly rock-cut (i.e. hemispeos) temple of pharaoh Ramesses II, which was built by the Viceroy of Nubia, Setau, at a site some 90 km south of Aswan. It was dedicated to "Ptah, Ptah-Tatenen and Hathor, and associated with Ramesses, 'the Great God.'" Gerf Hussein was known as Per Ptah or the "House of Ptah." An avenue of ram headed sphinxes led from the Nile to the first pylon, which like the courtyard beyond is also free standing. The courtyard is surrounded by six columns and eight statue pillars. The entrance to a peristyle court "is decorated with colossal Osiris statues." The rear portion of the building which is 43 m in depth was carved out of rock and follows the structure of Abu Simbel with a pillared hall featuring two rows of three statue pillars and, curiously, four statue recesses, each with divine triads along the sides. 
Beyond the hall lay the hall of the offering table and the barque chamber with four cult statues of Ptah, Ramesses, Ptah-Tatenen and Hathor carved out of the rock. During the building of the Aswan dam project in the 1960s, sections of the free-standing portion of this temple were dismantled and they have now been reconstructed at the site of New Kalabsha. Most of the rock cut temple was left in place and is now submerged beneath the waters of the Nile due to their poor condition.

The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is an Above the Title Productions radio adaptation, dramatised by Dirk Maggs and John Langdon of Douglas Adams's "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul". Starring Harry Enfield, Peter Davison, John Fortune and Stephen Moore, it started broadcasting on 2 October 2008 on BBC Radio 4.
The title is a quotation from the Adams novel "Life, The Universe and Everything", where it says of the immortally annoyed Wowbagger:
Changes between the novel and the radio adaptation.
In adapting the story for six half-hour episodes, Dirk Maggs has rescheduled the novel's convoluted plot:
The adaptation is an inverted detective story, shuffling the importance of characters: elevating the Draycotts, turning Neil Sharp into Kate Schechter's landlord and former "Pugilism and the Third Autistic Cuckoo" member with the now returned Richard McDuff. Cleaner Elena is inadvertently kidnapped by Nobby the Pawnbroker, after the battle with a ravenous fridge. 
On the audio trailer, Susan Way sells "Way Forward Technologies" to Sirius Cybernetics, Richard McDuff is detained by the Vogon catchphrase "resistance is useless", and the I-Ching Calculator has the 'Guide activation' sound, and is obtained from Nobby. 
Examples of updating to bring the story into the 21st century (the book was written in the 1980s) include the explosion now being at Heathrow Terminal 5 (with a new joke about lost luggage), this now being explained as "freak indoor Global Warming", various price increases, the introduction of mobile phones, e.g. text messages replacing telegrams, a discussion about only audio purists still using gramophones and the removal of American Kate's frustration at the unavailability of pizza delivery in the UK (now thankfully ancient history).
Kate awakes earlier in the hospital and sees Mr Rag taking away Thor and the soft drinks machine, and when she visits the Woodshead clinic she mentions Thor directly, rather than dropping many hints. 
When Dirk meets Sally Mills, he does not steal the book, as it proffered instead. Sally also remarks that the I-Ching calculator allows Dirk a way around obeying The Great Zaganza prediction that "everything you decide today will be wrong".
Episode 4 contains a telephone conversation where Richard MacDuff explains to Dirk that the motherboard of the I-Ching calculator was rubbish and is better put to use as an ultimate talking multi-media hand-held device. Hitchhiker's sound effects are used (as in the first series visit to the Mothership) and there is also a potentially familiar Sirius Cybernetics functionary.
In addition, the double-bass player's obvious question is changed from "I bet you wished you played the piccolo" to "how do you get it under your chin?", and Dirk forgets to ask Kate to phone him "before doing anything impossible".

Each episode as aired on BBC Radio 4 is 23 minutes long.

Tail-pulse generator

Tail pulse generators simulate the outputs of radiation detectors, photomultiplier tubes (PMT's) and their electronics. They in turn test systems and components for linearity, stability, resolution, pile-up and count rate effects. Tail pulse generators are differentiated from standard logic pulse generators in that the rise and fall times are exponential. 
These simulate the outputs of Germanium detectors, plastic scintillators and their PMT's, NaI scintillators and their PMT's and LaBr3/LaCl3 scintillators and their PMT's. The random tail-pulse generators can test for pile-up and count rate effects. The fast tail-pulse generators can simulate the 5 ns FWHM pulses of faster PMT outputs. The precision tail-pulse generators can test linearity, stability and resolution.

Radclive Halt railway station

Radclive Halt was a railway station on the Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line which served the village of Radclive in Buckinghamshire, England, from 1956 to 1961.
History.
During the summer of 1956 the Banbury to Buckingham section of the Banbury to Verney Junction branch line was chosen as the location for a single railcar experiment to encourage greater passenger patronage on the branch which was suffering from low receipts in the face of competition from buses and motor cars. The experiment formed part of the 1955 Modernisation Plan. The units would run from Banbury to Buckingham where a connection would be made with the traditional steam push-pull service to Bletchley.
New halts were opened at Radclive and Water Stratford and a third was proposed on the edge of Buckingham but not provided. The two halts were constructed of timber with old sleepers forming the platform surface; unlike the other stations on the line, the halts were constructed to standard train height and one car in length. They were equipped with little other than a simple wooden painted nameboard and several old LNWR oil lamps; there was no shelter for passengers nor even a bench. The lamps were lit by the Brackley stationmaster.
The two British Rail Derby Lightweight railcars, nos. M79900 and M79901, resulted in a reported 400% increase in traffic and were well used especially on market days and Saturdays when both ran together, carrying up to 120 passengers. Despite the increased revenue and reduction in costs, the railcars were unable to save the Banbury - Buckingham section from closure on 2 January 1961, with British Rail claiming that although the cars were well used during peak times, they ran empty at normal times. According to published figures, the line had been losing £14,000 per annum before the experiment with receipts of around £50 per month; the railcars resulted in an increase in the income of around £250 - £300 per month, but still ran at a loss of £400 per month and the annual loss on the line could not be reduced beyond £4,700.
Present day.
Although no trace remains of Radclive Halt, the trackbed through the station remains intact as a farm track.

On April 20, 1987, Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus, a Democrat, appointed Jones, a Republican, to represent floterial District 13 in the Idaho House of Representatives. Jones replaced Mike Strasser, who had moved out of state for work-related reasons.
Jones stood for election in 1988, and retained her seat.
In 1989, four-term State Senator Roger Fairchild resigned his seat in District 10, and Governor Andrus appointed the District 10 Representative, Mary Hartung, to fill the Senate vacancy. Andrus then asked Jones to fill the District 10 House vacancy.
Jones was elected to the House seat for District 10 in 1990. In 1992, due to reapportionment, she ran for, and won, District 9. She was re-elected to the District 9 seat in 1994 and 1996.
Jones resigned her legislative seat in 1998 and accepted a position as executive director of the Idaho Real Estate Commission. Prior to resigning, Jones had already won the 1998 Republican primary election for the seat. Governor Dirk Kempthorne appointed Thomas Limbaugh to fill Jones’ vacancy. (Limbaugh won the general election.)
House Revenue and Taxation Committee.
From 1997 to 1998 Jones chaired the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. She was appointed to this position by then-speaker of the Idaho House Mike Simpson, and was the first woman to hold the post.
State controller's office.
Jones challenged incumbent state Controller, Keith Johnson in the 2002 Republican primary election. In the three-way race she finished second to Johnson by 4,052 votes, losing by 3.2%.
In the 2006 Republican primary Jones returned and vied for the open State Controller’s seat against Royce C. Chigbrow. Jones won this primary race by 22,429 votes, a margin of 18.8%.
In the 2006 general election Jones faced Democratic candidate Jackie Groves Twilegar, and won by 73,969 votes, a margin of 17.06%.
Jones was involved in a serious automobile accident on May 25, 2012. She resigned on October 15, 2012, as a direct result of injuries sustained from the accident. She was succeeded by her chief of staff, Brandon D. Woolf.
Other service.
Nationally, Jones has served on the Board of Directors and as Treasurer for the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials (ARELLO). She has held office as the American Legislative Exchange Council’s (ALEC) Idaho Chairman and served on the organization’s national Board of Directors, as well as being named an Outstanding ALEC Leader. Donna has also been recognized by the Idaho March of Dimes as an Outstanding Woman of the Year.
Jones is an Idaho Certified Public Manager and served on the Idaho Hispanic Commission, Idaho Housing & Finance Association Advisory Board, Idaho Permanent Building Fund Advisory Council, and Multi-State Tax Commission.
As a member of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers (NASACT), Jones serves as the Vice Chairman of the International Committee, and sits on the Annual Conference Program Committee, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee (FMIAC), Governmental Accounting Standards and Market Oversight (GASMO) Committee, Committee on Outreach, and the Leadership Conference Task Force.
Personal life.
Don and Donna were married on June 9, 1956 in Middleton, Idaho, at the Methodist church. They have three children, daughters Dawn and Lisa, and son, Stuart. To date, Jones has seven grandchildren, three great-grandsons and one great-grand daughter. Don died on January 11, 2000.

Venetian Way (1957–1964) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1960 Kentucky Derby. Bred in Kentucky by John W. Greathouse, he was purchased by Chicago, Illinois businessman Isaac Blumberg who raced him under the "nom de course" of Sunny Blue Farm.
Venetian Way was trained by Victor J. Sovinski of Kankakee, Illinois. At age two, the colt made nine starts winning four times. Of his eleven starts at age three, he earned three more wins. Leading up to the 1960 U.S. Triple Crown series, Venetian Way ran second to Bally Ache in the Florida Derby. He was sent off as the third parimutuel betting choice in the Kentucky Derby behind favorite Tompion and second choice, Bally Ache.
1960 Triple Crown.
Ridden in the Kentucky Derby by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey, Bill Hartack, Venetian Way remained within striking distance then passed Bally Ache as they came around the final turn heading into the homestretch and won going away by 3½ lengths. In the ensuing Preakness Stakes, Venetian Way finished fifth to winner, Bally Ache, and then ran second behind Celtic Ash in the longest of the Triple Crown races, the 1½ mile Belmont Stakes.
Retired to stud for the 1965 season, Venetian Way was not successful as a sire.

Pan Wenshi is China's premier panda biologist. He serves as the Director of the Giant Panda and Wildlife Conservation Research Center at Peking University. His work proved that panda habitat needed to be protected for them to survive in the wild and that pandas are polygamous, where previously it was thought that a dominant male secured exclusive breeding rights.
Pan was born in Bangkok, Thailand in 1937 where his family had lived for five generations. When he was three years old, he moved with his parents to Shantou in Guangdong province.
Pan studied biology at Peking University. His first experience with Pandas was seeing the world's first captive-born panda at the Beijing zoo where he got to hold the infant panda.
He has also helped save the White-headed Langur species through his work at the Nongguan Nature Reserve in Chongzuo, China. His work to save the Langurs focused on both protecting the species, and improving the lives of the nearby villagers who were competing for resources with the Langurs. The population of Langurs declined from 2,000 in the late 1980s to just 96 when Pan began his work in 1996. Through Pan's efforts, the population has since climbed to over 500 in 2008.

Digital model railway control systems

A number of control systems are available to operate locomotives on model railways. The earlier traditional analog systems where the speed and the direction of a train is controlled by adjusting the voltage on the track are still popular while they have recently given way to control systems based on computer technology. Digital model railway control systems are the modern alternative to control a layout and greatly simplify the wiring and add more flexibility in operations.
Digital model railway control system basics.
Some Digital control systems provide the ability to independently control all aspects of operating a model railway using a minimum of wiring, the rails themselves can be the only wiring required.Other systems are truly Wireless. Control is achieved by sending a digital signal as well as power down the rails or wirelessly. These digital signals can control all aspects of the model trains and accessories, including signals, turnouts, lighting, level crossings, cranes, turntables, etc.
Constant power is supplied to the track and digital signals are sent which require electronic decoders to be fitted to locomotives and other devices to interpret the commands.
Controllers.
Controllers manage operation of locomotives. Controllers have keys to select the locomotive, display to indicate the selection, and rotary control knobs ("throttle") for speed and direction control. Controllers also have auxiliary function buttons for additional model features such as lighting and sound.
Central unit.
Every digital system requires a central unit to generate digital command signals, most central units also incorporate one or more locomotive controllers and a booster unit to generate the power necessary to run locomotives. Central units also have connections for additional controllers and accessory switch boxes, as well as connections for computer control and interfaces with other digital controllers.
Boosters.
In some systems, Boosters are required to provide additional track power for larger layouts. Boosters are connected to the central unit by special cables and relay the digital commands.
Locomotive decoders.
Locomotive decoders are small electronic devices fitted inside locomotives to interpret the digital signals and provide individual control. The decoder interprets the digital signals sent from the central unit. Although all active decoders receive commands, only the addressed decoder will respond.
Accessory decoders.
Accessory decoders are used to control devices which are fixed in position, such as turnouts, signals, and level crossings. Since the devices do not move, stationary decoders can be mounted under the layout, and therefore can be significantly larger than locomotive decoders. Accessory decoders can receive their signals from an accessory data bus or from the track.
Sound and function decoders.
Basic locomotive decoders provide control of speed and direction. Supplemental decoders can be placed into a locomotive, to control headlights, ditch lights, or movable non-traction components such as remote-controlled pantographs. These decoders are called Function Decoders.
Sound decoders are, in essence, a miniature PC sound-card with pre-recorded sounds. The sound effects are played in synchronization with the locomotive, so that as a diesel locomotive starts from standstill, the sound decoder plays sounds of a diesel engine starting up. Sound decoders for steam locomotives can play "chuff" sounds in synchrony with rotation of the driving wheels.
Some decoders have all three functions—locomotive control, sound effects, and function control—in a single device.
Feedback bus.
In some systems, To automate a digitally controlled model railroad, the Central Unit needs to know when trains reach their destination, or when the train reaches a certain point. This information is detected by a sensor, such as an infrared device placed between the tracks, or a device which senses current-draw in a particular section of otherwise-isolated track.
The Feedback Bus is the device which relays an electrical signal—an "on" condition—from the sensor hardware back to the digital Central Unit. The Central Unit can then issue commands appropriate for the specific sensor, such as triggering a specific signal, or level crossing.
The advantage of feedback is that each device typically needs only two wires: one to each digital track signal.
Computer Interface.
Some Central Units
Systems.
Digital Command Control.
Digital Command Control (DCC) systems are used to operate locomotives on a model railroad (railway). Equipped with DCC, locomotives on the same electrical section of track can be independently controlled. While DCC is only one of several alternative systems for digital model train control, it is often misinterpreted to be a generic term for such systems. Several major manufacturers offer DCC systems.
Digital Command System.
Digital Command System (DCS) is an electronic control system developed by MTH Electric Trains and released in April 2002. DCS controls locomotives equipped with Protosound 2, Protosound 3, or Protosound 3E+ decoders. Protosound 3 locomotives are compatible with both DCS and DCC command systems. Protosound 3E+ locomotives are compatible with DCS and Märklin Digital command systems. All DCS compatible decoders are manufactured by MTH. Factory installed decoders have been offered in HO scale, two-rail O scale, 3-rail O gauge, Gauge 1, and three-rail Standard Gauge models. MTH has announced their intention to install DCS compatible decoders in S scale trains beginning in 2013. Separate sale decoder kits have been offered for installation in all of the above noted scales except HO and S. DCS is predominantly used in three-rail O gauge. Its chief competitors in three-rail O are Lionel's TMCC and Legacy systems.
DCS uses proprietary command codes and transmission technology covered under US patent 6,457,681.[http://www.protosound2.com/dcs/Patent.pdf] The principal differences between DCS and DCC transmission technologies include bidirectional communications and the separation of the command signal from track power. DCS command signals are transmitted at 10.7 MHz using spread spectrum technology.
DCS can operate TMCC equipped models by means of an interface cable that connects the Lionel CB-1 command base to the DCS Track Interface Unit. DCS can coexist on the same track at the same time with either Lionel TMCC or Legacy command systems. Engines with either system can be operated simultaneously as long as both command control units are installed on the track.
Märklin Digital.
Märklin Digital was one of the first digital model railway control systems. It consisted of a full system including locomotive decoders (based on a Motorola chip), central control, a computer interface, turnout decoders, digital relays and s88 feedback modules. For controlling 2-rail DC locomotives, like Märklin's Z and 1 gauge rolling stock, a special variety of the system was introduced in 1988. This version was developed by Lenz jointly for Märklin and Arnold. Arnold sold the system under name Arnold Digital while Märklin called it "Märklin Digital =". This system was the pre-decessor of DCC-standard. Apart from the locomotive decoders and central units, all the other system components were identical between 3-rail and 2-rail versions.
Selectrix.
Selectrix is an early digital model train command control system developed by German company Döhler & Haas for model railway manufacturer Trix in the early 1980s. Since 1999 Selectrix is an open system supported by several manufacturers and standardized by MOROP. Technically Selectrix differs from competing bus systems by being fully synchronized and bi-directional. The same data bus protocol and data buses are shared by the rolling stock, accessories and feedback information.
Trainmaster Command Control.
Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC) is Lionel's original command control system. It was introduced exclusively in Lionel trains in 1995. Beginning in 2000, Lionel offered licenses to other manufacturers. Licensees that formerly or currently install TMCC decoders in their models include Atlas O, K-Line, Weaver, and Sunset Models 3rd Rail Division. Licensees that formerly or currently offer separate sale decoders include Train America Studios, Digital Dynamics, and Electric RR Co. TMCC decoders have mostly been installed in 3-rail O gauge models, but it has also been offered in 2-rail O scale and S scale.
TMCC utilizes the same command codes as Digital Command Control (DCC). However, unlike DCC, it uses a 455 kHz radio transmission to carry the command codes separate from track power. The locomotive decoders are dependent on AC track power (50 or 60 Hz) to synchronize the command receiver. Thus, TMCC can only operate on AC track power. Because TMCC utilizes the DCC command codes, it is possible to control TMCC with DCC compatible software. MTH Electric Trains included support to interface and control TMCC with its DCS system. Unlike DCC, TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives. Lionel ceased the sale of TMCC command systems in 2010, but continues to introduce models equipped with TMCC decoders. TMCC has been superseded by Lionel's Legacy command system.
Legacy Control System.
Legacy Control System (Legacy) is Lionel's current electronic control system. It was introduced as a successor to Lionel's Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC) in December, 2007. Legacy is backward compatible with all TMCC decoder equipped engines. Models with Legacy sound decoders and/or Odyssey II speed control can be operated with earlier TMCC control systems but also have addition features only accessible with Legacy. The command codes for these additional features differ from the DCC command codes. Lionel has not published or licensed access to the Legacy specific command codes.
Hornby Zero 1.
Hornby Zero 1 is a forerunner to the modern digital model railway control system, developed by Hornby in the late 1970s. It was based around the TMS1000 4-bit microprocessor. The Zero 1 system offered simultaneous control of up to 16 locomotives and 99 accessories.The Hammant & Morgan digital train control system is totally compatible with the Zero One,the master controller,"HM5000 Advanced Power Transmitter" boasted TWO sliders,of 14 steps each,direction LED's power LED bar graph,timer clocks,digital display of locos under control,readout of accessories controlled,& ability to attach TWO "Hi-Tec Speed Transmitter" slave controllers HM5500, Zero 1 was released in late 1979.
A multiple train control system named "Zero 1" was introduced in late 1979. This control system was a forerunner to the Digital Command Control (DCC) system, an NMRA open standard, which appeared in the 1990s. Though an important milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; both the controller units and the decoder modules required for the locomotives and accessories were expensive, but with a clean track and well serviced locos the system worked more or less as advertised.
The Zero 1 system supplied the track with a 20V square wave at the local mains frequency (50 Hz in the UK, 60 Hz in the US) with a 32-bit control word replacing every third cycle. The decoder module in the locomotive would switch either the positive or the negative half-cycle of the square wave to the motor according to the desired direction of travel. During the transmission of the control word, it would remain switched off. Speed control was achieved by varying the width of the portion of the half-cycle which was switched, in 14 steps.
This system allowed for straightforward implementation with the semiconductor technology of the time, but had the disadvantage that the power supplied to the motor was highly discontinuous - as can be seen from the description above, it took the form of square pulses of a maximum width of 10ms, recurring at intervals which alternated between 20ms and 40ms (for a 50 Hz mains supply). This caused the running of the motor to be extremely noisy and rough. Fine control of a locomotive at low speed was also difficult, partly due to the rough running, partly due to the inherent coarseness of a 14-step speed scale, and partly because there was a significant delay between operator input to the controller and response from the locomotive.
Locomotives fitted with a Zero 1 decoder according to Hornby's instructions could not be used on conventional systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts. It was possible to include a miniature DPDT switch in the installation to enable the Zero 1 decoder to be switched out for use on a conventional system, but the official Hornby information made no mention of this, causing potential customers to perceive a significant disadvantage to the system which did not in fact exist.
Control of points and other accessories was available in a very simple manner. For solenoid-operated accessories (e.g. points, mechanical signals) or accessories involving lights (e.g. colour light signals), track-powered accessory decoder modules, each providing four outputs, were available. Each output could be configured either for burst operation or continuous output, for use with solenoids or lights respectively. Accessories were switched by entering a numeric code on the controller. Up to 99 accessories could be controlled.
Accessories based around motors rather than solenoids or lights, such as turntables, could be fitted with a locomotive module and controlled in the same manner as a locomotive.
Zero 1 had 3 'phased' introductions:
Phase 1 = Master controller and basic system (Master controller, slave controller, hand held slave unit and loco modules)
Phase 2 = Accessory control (Points, Signals etc.)
Phase 3 = Micro Mimic display (Allowed for LEDs to represent status of points and signals on a mimic display panel)
The main master controller unit was discontinued in 1986, and the last time loco modules were listed was in the 1991 catalogue - 'Limited supplies of R955 loco module are available'. 
Repairs to Zero 1 units were no longer undertaken by Hornby, the reason given being 'Lack of available parts required'.
The system is very reliable, the basic 1980s keyboard design being the main problem on older badly stored master units. It is easily repaired though and can be made to work like new in a few simple steps.Members of the well established & respected MERG group here:-http://www.merg.org.uk/ can buy a complete kit of parts to replace the master controller keypad (on a Hornby Zero 1 controller,or the superior Hammant & Morgan HM5000 Power Transmitter) at a very low price,kit number 71 is the one you need,however,this author has had great success with a simple 3mm square of self-adhesive aluminum foil stuff onto the carbon "pills" of the rubber membrane keypad.
Loco modules were available in two types. The pre-1981 types were based on a single triac. The square-wave supply and the presence of spikes from the motor and from poor contacts rendered the dV/dt rating of the triac marginal and these units would sometimes self-trigger on the wrong polarity half-cycle, resulting in damage both to the unit itself and to the locomotive motor. The later type, made by H&M, used two SCRs, one for "forward" and one for "reverse", to avoid this problem.
Again, the loco modules are easy to repair with the right skills.
The system is still used today by many modellers, as is shown by the demand on sites like eBay for the items in the second hand market. 
The unused sockets on the rear of the Phase 3 Mimic controller hinted at the way development could have been heading - a light pen socket possibly indicating a link to a computer and control via light pen. Given that this was the era of the Sinclair Spectrum (which was launched two years after Zero 1), the system was perhaps ahead of its time. 
The DCC system which is today's current standard for digital control of a model railway is similar in many ways to how Zero 1 worked.MERG http://www.merg.org.uk/ has a list of Hornby Zero 1 bulletins & original Hornby documents describing the system further,a "Hornby Zero 1 Protocol Group" exists here :- http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mergZero1 where many pictures,documents & discussions can be found.
On eBay & swap meets a vibrant & active market still exists,another British product line ZTC Controls,here http://ztccontrols.co.uk/ has a controller that not only has the Zero 1 protocol,but also has,pure DC,PWM DC,NMRA DCC & 50 Hz & 60 Hz capability,a truly versatile controller,in fact invented & brought to market by the original inventor of Hornby Zero 1,Mr.Robin Palmer, all praise to him.
Zero 1 will do all you ask of it,you must play your part,track cleanliness,ONE DROP of silver loaded paint to code the decoders,both sides of motor brushes insulated with anglers silicone tube,red,black & green wires,soldered,NOT simply twisted & crimped,heat shrink wrap on exposed connections.
Airfix Multiple Control System.
Airfix Multiple Control System(MTC) was introduced in 1980 and used 20v AC on the track with a superimposed control signal. Unfortunately it was only produced for about 18 months when Airfix went into receivership and the concept was not developed but dropped. MTC system offered simultaneous control any 4 out of up to 16 locomotives.
DYNATROL.
DYNATROL is a 15-channel command control system from Power Systems Inc.The track voltage is 13.5 volts d.c.It was introduced late 1970s.
Digitrack 1600.
Digitrack 1600 is one of the first generation digital model railway control system developed and marketed by Chuck Balmer and Dick Robbins in 1972. CTC-16 is a second-generation design based on the Digitrack 1600, a commercial system marketed from 1972 to 1976. The CTC-16 digital train control system is totally compatible with the Digitrack 1600.
Digitrack 1600 was analog in nature, with pulses riding on a constant DC track voltage. The width and timing of the pulse determined speed and direction.
Rail-Command 816.
RAIL-COMMAND 816 is an 8-channel digital signal system using a 12 volts d.c.constant track voltage.It was introduced late 1970s.
CTC-16.
CTC-16 system offered simultaneous control of up to 16 locomotives. A series of 16 variable width pulses is sent out to the track 125 times each second. A receiver mounted in each locomotive is "programmed" to respond to only one of the 16 pulses. The voltage and polarity applied to the motor depends on the width/timing of the pulse corresponding to that particular receiver. The receiver determines the speed and direction information from that specific pulse.The receiver is essentially a transistor throttle built right into the locomotive. The command station is not expandable beyond 16 channels.
CTC-16 was completely compatible with the Digitrack 1600 receivers, as it was an improved and cost reduced version of the Digitrack 1600. It was presented as a "build it yourself" project, commercial versions would appear as well. At the time, the project was estimated to cost $200 for the parts.
PROTRAC.
PROTRACR/C system 9000 offers 8-channel command control.It was introduced late 1970s.
SALOTA 5300.
SALOTA 5300 offers 5-channel command control with a 16-to 18-volt d.c. constant track voltage.
It was introduced late 1970s.
PMP-112.
PMP-112 system offered simultaneous control of up to 112 locomotives. It was based CTC-16.
RFPT.
RFPT offers 9-channel command control system using high-frequency control signals and a 12-volt a.c. constant track voltage.
KATO Digital.
KATO Digital is KATO's electronic control system for HO scale model trains. Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC).It was introduced late 1980s.
Software.
Digital model railway control systems are often connected with an external computer where special software for controlling the train layout is running. This allows more options for operating trains from fully automatic system where the computer is in control of everything in a layout to a computer based control console for controlling signals and points on the layout and leaving the role of the train engineer to a human.
Hornby RailMaster.
RailMaster is a new model railway control software package announced by Hornby, one of the world's largest model railway companies, at Christmas 2010. The software connects to the Hornby Elite DCC controller (at present) and allows for the controls of trains, points, signals, turntables and uncouplers from a single screen. Although you can use it with a normal mouse, it has been optimised for touch-screen PCs where you just touch a point, a signal or slide a locomotive throttle.
This link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGfiuO2o9NQ is a video on YouTube showing the new system.
The new RailMaster software will be available to purchase during the second quarter 2011. Hornby aim to set the standard in PC model railway control software and have a comprehensive action plan to significantly enhance this area over the coming years.
Rocrail.
Rocrail is an Open Source Project that can control a model train layout from one or more computers. You can run trains directly from your computer, and you can have the computer run trains automatically for you. You can even have some of the trains on your layout running automatically while you control others by hand.

Pungcha

A pungcha is a type of traditional Korean winter hat worn by both men and women during the Joseon period for protection against the cold. It is also called "pungchae" and "jeongpungcha". Although its shape is very similar with nambawi, the "pungcha" has a "bolkki" (볼끼) attached on both sides of the ears. It was originally worn by males of yangban, the upper class but became to spread to commoners including women.
The "pungcha" is open on the top so that it does not cover the top of the head just like other winter caps such as "nambawi", "ayam", and "jobawi". Whereas it fully covers the forehead, back and ears on the sides as well as cheeks by the "bokki". The outer is generally made of a variety of silk called "dan" (단, ), wool and a fabric made from kudzu barks were used.

Water Stratford Halt railway station

Water Stratford Halt was a railway station on the Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line which served the village of Water Stratford in Buckinghamshire, England, from 1956 to 1961.
History.
During the summer of 1956 the Banbury to Buckingham section of the Banbury to Verney Junction branch line was chosen as the location for a single railcar experiment to encourage greater passenger patronage on the branch which was suffering from low receipts in the face of competition from buses and motor cars. The experiment formed part of the 1955 Modernisation Plan. The units would run from Banbury to Buckingham where a connection would be made with the traditional steam push-pull service to Bletchley.
New halts were opened at Radclive and Water Stratford and a third was proposed on the edge of Buckingham but not provided. The two halts were constructed of timber with old sleepers forming the platform surface; unlike the other stations on the line, the halts were constructed to standard train height and one car in length. They were equipped with little other than a simple wooden painted nameboard and several old LNWR oil lamps; there was no shelter for passengers nor even a bench. The lamps were lit by the Brackley stationmaster.
The two British Rail Derby Lightweight railcars, nos. M79900 and M79901, resulted in a reported 400% increase in traffic and were well used especially on market days and Saturdays when both ran together, carrying up to 120 passengers. Despite the increased revenue and reduction in costs, the railcars were unable to save the Banbury - Buckingham section from closure on 2 January 1961, with British Rail claiming that although the cars were well used during peak times, they ran empty at normal times. According to published figures, the line had been losing £14,000 per annum before the experiment with receipts of around £50 per month; the railcars resulted in an increase in the income of around £250 - £300 per month, but still ran at a loss of £400 per month and the annual loss on the line could not be reduced beyond £4,700.
Present day.
Although no trace remains of Water Stratford Halt, the trackbed through the station remains intact and a public footpath follows it for some distance.

<doc id="19444126" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19444126" title="Pseudofeces">
Pseudofeces

Pseudofeces or pseudofaeces are a way that filter-feeding bivalve mollusks (and filter-feeding gastropod mollusks) get rid of suspended particles which have been rejected as unsuitable for food. The rejected particles are wrapped in mucus, and are expelled without having passed through the digestive tract. Thus although they may closely resemble the mollusk's real feces they are not actually feces, hence the name pseudofeces, meaning false feces.
Bivalves which exhibit this behavior are numerous and include Ostreidae oysters (such as "Crassostrea") and Dreissenidae false mussels (such as "Dreissena"). Gastropods which filter feed are in a minority, but include the mudsnail genus Batillariaand deep sea vent limpets in the family Lepetodrilidae.[http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/full/210/2/140
Bivalves have two siphons or apertures at the "posterior" edge of their mantle cavity: an inhalant or incurrent siphon, and an exhalant or excurrent siphon or aperture. The water is circulated by the action of the gills. Usually water enters the mantle cavity through the inhalent siphon, moves over the gills, and leaves through the exhalent siphon. The water current is utilized for respiration, but also for feeding, and for reproduction. The mouth of the bivalve is situated "anterior" to the gills. The bivalve needs phytoplankton as its food source, but the water circulating through the bivalve also usually contains other particles such as small grains of sand, detritus, etc.
After moving over the gill margins, particles reach the mouth of the bivalve. Each side of the mouth of the bivalve has an inner and an outer appendage called a palp. The outer palp has a long extensible proboscis, which collects incoming particulate matter. The particles are then sorted by both the inner and outer palps, which have ciliated grooves for collecting organic material. These food grooves sort the particles by both density and size. The inner pair of palps transfers smaller and lighter particles, such as phytoplankton, to the mouth, using ciliary currents. Some material is rejected because it is too large or too dense: this is often pieces of sediment or detritus, but also includes some overly large edible particles. The outer palps send this rejected material into the mantle cavity as a mucus-bound mass. These mucus-bound masses are the pseudofeces.
Pseudofeces accumulate with, and look much like, the actual feces in the bottom of the mantle cavity. The unwanted material is periodically ejected (usually through the inhalant siphon or aperture) by contractions of the adductor muscles, which "clap" the shells together, pushing most of the water out of the mantle cavity and forcibly ejecting both the feces and the pseudofeces.
Planktonic food is not usually in short supply, and therefore accidentally rejecting a few larger edible particles along with the larger or denser inedible ones is a small price to pay in order to optimize the processing of the rest of the food.
Land runoff containing particulate pollutants and excess nutrients can cause problems in estuaries and coastal waters. Bivalves can filter the particulate pollutants, and either eat them or discharge them as pseudofeces deposits onto the benthic substrate, where they are relatively harmless. Chesapeake Bay's once-flourishing oyster populations historically filtered the estuary's entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days.

Tibetan Women's Association

The Tibetan Women's Association (TWA) is a women's association based in McLeodGanj, Dharamshala, India. The group was officially formed on September 10, 1984 in India, by Rinchen Khando Choegyal, a former Tibetan Youth Congress activist, although the group itself claims that a precursor was created in Tibet during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion. Stephanie Roemer traces the organization back to the Lhasa Patriotic Woman's Association, founded in 1953 by the People's Liberation Army, which introduced the idea of women participating in politics, which was "radical" to Tibet.
During the 1960s and 1970s, organizations of Tibetan women made Tibetan clothing and carpets without pay for the exile Central Tibetan Administration, which sold them for profit. It was only in the 1980s when the exile community in India would allow women to participate in politics, that an association of Tibetan women was officially formed. 
The goals of the TWA are twofold: to promote the perpetuation of 
Tibetans and Tibetan culture in exile, including by promoting endogamy among Tibetans, and to bring to international fora alleged human rights abuses of Tibetan women in Tibet. In India, the TWA has created the Tibetan Nuns Project to educate nuns and sponsors various cultural events like folk dances. In 1995, the TWA attempted to join the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, but the organization was denied accreditation on technical grounds, a situation which received widespread disapproving press coverage in America and Europe.
Today, the group has 37 branches worldwide and 11,000 members. In 2012, it was revealed that the president of the TWA, who is also a member of the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration, had embezzled $3,800 from the organization from 2000 to 2003.

<doc id="19444228" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19444228" title="Label-free quantification">
Label-free quantification

Label-free quantification is a method in mass spectrometry that aims to determine the relative amount of proteins in two or more biological samples. Unlike other methods for protein quantification, label-free quantification does not use a stable isotope containing compound to chemically bind to and thus label the protein.
Implementation.
Label-free quantification is based on precursor signal intensity, which is, in most cases applied to data acquired on high mass precision spectrometers equipped with the new generation of time-of-flight (ToF), fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR), or Orbitrap mass analyzers. The high-resolution power facilitates the extraction of peptide signals on the MS1 level and thus uncouples the quantification from the identification process.
This is not true for another method of label-free quantification, spectral counting, which simply counts the number of spectra identified for a given peptide in different biological samples and then integrates the results for all measured peptides of the protein(s) that are quantified.
The computational framework of label free approach includes detecting peptides, matching the corresponding peptides across multiple LC-MS data, selecting discriminatory peptides.
Intact protein expression spectrometry (IPEx) is a label-free quantification approach in mass spectrometry under development by the analytical chemistry group at the United States Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and elsewhere. Intact proteins are analyzed by an LCMS instrument, usually a quadrupole time-of-flight in profile mode, and the full protein profile is determined and quantified using data reduction software. Early results are very encouraging. In one study, two groups of treatment replicates from mammalian samples (different organisms with similar treatment histories, but not technical replicates) show dozens of low CV protein biomarkers, suggesting that IPEx is a viable technology for studying protein expression. 
Detecting peptides.
Typically, peptide signals are detected at the MS1 level and distinguished from chemical noise through their characteristic isotopic pattern. These patterns are then tracked across the retention time dimension and used to reconstruct a chromatographic elution profile of the mono-isotopic peptide mass. The total ion current of the peptide signal is then integrated and used as a quantitative measurement of the original peptide concentration. For each detected peptide, all isotopic peaks are first found and the charge state is then assigned.
While the first method, introduced above, has problems due to the identity of the peptide precursor ion that is being measured which, in high-throughput studies, could easily be a completely different peptide happening to display a similar m/z ratio and elutes at the same time or overlapping with other peptides.
The second method has problems due to the fact that the peptides are identified thus making it necessary to run an additional MS/MS scan which takes time and therefore reduces the resolution of the experiment.
Matching corresponding peptides.
In contrast to differential labelling, every biological specimen needs to be measured separately in a label-free experiment. The extracted peptide signals are then mapped across few or multiple LC-MS measurements using their coordinates on the mass-to-charge and retention-time dimensions. Data from high mass precision instruments greatly facilitate this process and increase the certainty of matching correct peptide signals across runs.
Clearly, differential processing of biological samples makes it necessary to have a standard which can be used to adjust the results. Peptides that are not expected to change in their expression levels in different biological samples may be used for this purpose. However, not all peptides ionize well and therefore the choice of candidates should be done after an initial study which should only characterize the protein content of the biological samples that will be investigated.
Selecting discriminatory peptides.
Finally, sophisticated normalization methods are used to remove systematic artefacts in the peptide intensity values between LC-MS measurements. Then, discriminatory peptides are identified by selecting the peptides whose normalized intensities are different (e.g., p-value < 0.05) among multiple groups of samples.
In addition, newer hybrid mass spectrometers like LTQ OrbiTrap offer the possibility to acquire MS/MS peptide identifications in parallel to the high mass precision measurement of peptides on the MS1 level. This raises the computational challenge for the processing and integration of these two sources of information and has led to the development of novel promising quantification strategies.

Since forming Blonde Redhead in 1993 with twin brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace, Makino has released eight studio albums with the band.
Biography.
Makino was born in Kyoto, Japan. Her father fought in World War II, Korean and Vietnam Wars. He met her mother while in the army. He died in 2001. Her mother moved to the United States in 1968. Makino attended a private school, which she disliked. Makino was trained on classical piano as a child and then went on to form an all-girl band in elementary school, as a singer. The band wrote their own lyrics and played what she described as blues music.
After high school, Makino enrolled in college where she studied art. While studying alongside Maki Takahashi, she met Italian twin brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace in 1993 in a New York City Italian restaurant. The meeting was orchestrated by a friend who felt the group would have a good musical chemistry, which resulted in the conception of the alternative rock band Blonde Redhead in 1993. Makino has stated that she had never intended to have a career in music, and that she also suffers from stage fright.
Makino is an avid equestrian and keeps a horse called Harry. In 2002 she suffered an accident falling from a horse; in the accident, the horse trampled her jaw and crushed her facial bones, which required massive reconstructive surgery. Her mouth was wired shut, and she convalesced for months, using the time to write songs. The song "Equus", from the 2004 album "Misery is a Butterfly", refers to the accident. Makino has stated that she often draws influence from horses while writing music: "They are so musical in their movements and in the sounds they make. Everything they do is rhythmic. I get ideas for grooves—rhythmic ideas—just from riding.”

Where do you want to go today?

“Where do you want to go today?” was the title of Microsoft’s 2nd global image advertising campaign. The broadcast, print and outdoor advertising campaign was launched in November 1994 through the advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, the firm best known for its work on behalf of Nike, Inc.. The campaign, which "The New York Times" described as taking “a winsome, humanistic approach to demystifying technology,” had Microsoft spending $100 million through July 1995, of which $25 million would be spent during the holiday shopping season ending in December 1994.
Tony Kaye directed a series of television ads filmed in Hong Kong, Prague and New York City that showed a broad range of people using their PCs. The television ads were first broadcast in Australia on November 13, the following day in both the United States and Canada, with Britain, France and Germany seeing the spots in subsequent days. An eight-page print ad describe the personal computer as “an open opportunity for everybody” that “ the flow of information so that good ideas —wherever they come from— can be shared”, and was placed in mass-market magazines including "National Geographic", "Newsweek", "People", "Rolling Stone" and "Sports Illustrated".
In August 1995, the "Times" reported that the response to Microsoft’s campaign in the advertising trade press had been “lukewarm”, and quoted Brad Johnson of "Advertising Age" as stating that “Microsoft is on version 1.0 in advertising. Microsoft is not standing still. It will improve its advertising.” Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer, then the firm’s executive vice president, acknowledged that the response to the campaign had been “chilly”.
In June 1999, Microsoft announced that it would be ending its nearly five-year-long relationship with Wieden+Kennedy, shifting $100 million in billings to McCann Erickson Worldwide Advertising in a split that was described by "The New York Times" as mutual. Dan Wieden, president and chief creative officer of the advertising agency, characterized the relationship with Microsoft as “intense” and said that it had “run its course.”

Danny Welbeck

Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah "Danny" Welbeck (born 26 November 1990) is an English footballer who plays for Manchester United and the England national team. He is a centre forward who can also play on the wing.
Welbeck made his way through the youth teams at Manchester United before making his senior debut in 2008 and scoring in the process. He went on to win the 2008–09 Football League Cup and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup before being sent on loan to Preston North End and more recently Sunderland. Since the 2011–12 season, Welbeck has been a regular figure in the Manchester United first team.
He made his senior England debut in March 2011 in a 1–1 friendly draw against Ghana, the nationality of both of his parents. He scored his first senior international goal on 2 June 2012, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 friendly victory over Belgium.
Club career.
Early career.
Born in Longsight, Manchester, England, to Ghanaian parents, Welbeck was first spotted by Manchester United as a six-year-old. At eight years old, he impressed with local side Fletcher Moss, and was finally picked up by the Manchester United youth academy. He joined United during the 2005–06 season, making his debut for the club's Under-18 side on 8 April 2006 in a league match against Sunderland. He then came on as a substitute in the next game, before being named as an unused substitute in the team's last two games of the season. The following season, he made a further 28 appearances for the Under-18s, scoring nine goals, including eight appearances and one goal in the FA Youth Cup, in which he helped the team to reach the final, despite being two years younger than some of the other players. He was not handicapped despite suffering from Osgood–Schlatter disease, and was making rapid progress, despite his pneumonia.
Welbeck signed his first trainee contract in July 2007, and started the 2007–08 season in the Under-18 side, but was quickly promoted to the Reserve team, making a number of substitute appearances. Then, in January 2008, he was called up to the first team for the trip to Saudi Arabia to play Al-Hilal in Sami Al-Jaber's testimonial. Welbeck made his debut in that game on 21 January 2008, coming on as a 65th-minute substitute for Anderson. Welbeck had the chance to snatch a draw for United when he was brought down in the penalty area in the final minute, but he put the penalty kick over the bar.
On 25 January 2008, Alex Ferguson revealed that Welbeck would be considered a first-team squad member for the rest of the 2007–08 season. On 9 February 2008, Alex Ferguson revealed that Welbeck would be involved in the matchday squad for the Manchester derby the following day. He also hinted that Welbeck may be involved from the start of the game. This did not come to pass however, as he was left out of the team entirely.
Welbeck made his competitive debut for the Manchester United first team on 23 September 2008, starting up front in the team's League Cup Third Round match at home to Middlesbrough. United won the game 3–1, but Welbeck did not manage to get on the scoresheet despite going close in the third minute. He played again in the Fourth Round against Queens Park Rangers on 11 November 2008, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Rodrigo Possebon. A few minutes later, he was brought down in the penalty area by Peter Ramage; Carlos Tévez converted the resulting penalty kick and United won the match 1–0. Welbeck made his Premier League debut on 15 November 2008, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Park Ji-Sung against Stoke City. He marked his debut with a curling 30-yard strike into the top right corner for United's fourth goal in a 5–0 win. Welbeck's next senior appearance for Manchester United came in an FA Cup Third Round tie against Southampton on 4 January 2009, when he opened the scoring in a 3–0 win. He followed that performance with a goal in the Fifth Round victory over Derby County.
On 23 September 2009, Welbeck scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season and first in the League Cup; he hit the only goal of the game in the Third Round against Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 27 October 2009, Welbeck scored in his second successive League Cup game, scoring the first against Barnsley in a 2–0 win. On 25 November 2009, Welbeck made his Champions League debut in the 1–0 defeat to Beşiktaş. On 11 December 2009, Welbeck committed his future to the club by signing a new contract, keeping his services at United until 2013.
Preston North End (loan).
On 25 January 2010, Welbeck became Alex Ferguson's son Darren Ferguson's first signing as Preston North End manager since he took charge earlier in the month, signing on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season. As part of his recovery, he took part in a training session at Manchester United's training ground, but his knee swelled up again. The injury required surgery and Welbeck's loan was cut short on 16 March so that he could return to Manchester United for the operation.
Sunderland (loan).
On 12 August 2010, Welbeck became Steve Bruce's eighth summer signing after Sunderland signed the United striker on loan for the duration of the 2010–11 season. Welbeck's debut for Sunderland came on 14 August as an 83rd-minute substitute for Darren Bent in a 2–2 home draw against Birmingham City. On 14 November, Welbeck scored his first Sunderland goal as he completed the scoring in a 3–0 away victory over Chelsea, rounding off what was described as an "impressive individual performance". Eight days later, Welbeck scored his first home goals for Sunderland, striking twice in a 2–2 draw with Everton. Welbeck scored the only goal as Sunderland beat Bolton Wanderers on 18 December 2010, and also scored on 1 January 2011 as Sunderland defeated Blackburn Rovers 3–0. Welbeck's form for Sunderland promted widespread calls for an England call up. However, on 5 January, Welbeck picked up a hamstring injury in Sunderland's victory at Aston Villa, ruling him out for eight weeks. He made his return on 5 March 2011, in a 0–0 draw away to Arsenal, coming on as a substitute for Steed Malbranque in the 68th minute; he almost scored a late goal that would have won the game for Sunderland in the 83rd minute, but his shot was saved by Wojciech Szczęsny. He picked up an injury in the 4–2 home win over Wigan Athletic on 23 April, and he returned to Manchester United for treatment for the remainder of the season.
Manchester United first team.
2011–12 season.
Welbeck was given a starting berth in the 2011 FA Community Shield match at Wembley Stadium on 7 August 2011. United won the game 3–2, having trailed rivals Manchester City 2–0 at half time. He started alongside Wayne Rooney in the first league game of the 2011–12 Premier League season away to West Bromwich Albion; he was substituted in the 65th minute, to be replaced by Dimitar Berbatov. On 22 August, Welbeck scored the opening goal of the match against Tottenham Hotspur, heading in a cross from Tom Cleverley from nine yards to score in the 61st minute. He then provided an assist for Anderson in the 76th minute to make the score 2–0 before being substituted. United eventually won the match at Old Trafford 3–0. The next match against Arsenal also had Welbeck on the scoresheet. From outside the box, Anderson chipped the ball into Welbeck and he easily headed it over the goalkeeper to make the score 1–0. However, Welbeck had to leave the field early with a pulled hamstring which, consequently, ruled him out for several weeks. Welbeck scored twice in a Champions League group match against Basel in September 2011, the game ended 3–3. Welbeck scored again in the next game, a 2–0 home win over Norwich City, after coming on as a second-half substitute. He exchanged passes with Park Ji-Sung before sweeping low into the bottom corner to seal the win. On 21 December 2011, Welbeck opened the scoring at Craven Cottage in a 5–0 United away win against Fulham. He met Nani's cross and steered the ball in with his left foot. On 8 January, Welbeck scored the second goal in a 3–2 away victory against Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium in the FA Cup third round. Patrice Evra made a half-cleared cross, which Welbeck volleyed into Costel Pantilimon's bottom corner. On 14 January, Welbeck scored the second goal in a 3–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers, after latching onto a through ball by Wayne Rooney. On 22 January, Welbeck scored the winning goal in the 81st minute in a 2–1 away victory at the Emirates Stadium over Arsenal – his third goal in three games. Welbeck played his 50th overall match for Manchester United on 23 February in a 2–1 home loss to Ajax in the round of 32 of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. On 18 March, Welbeck scored in a 5–0 victory over Wolves at Molineux Stadium. On 15 April, he scored a goal late on in the first half against Aston Villa. A week later, Welbeck scored again against Everton but the match ended at 4–4. His impressive performances throughout the 2011–12 campaign earned him a place on the shortlist for the 2012 PFA Young Player of the Year Award, which was won by Tottenham Hotspur defender Kyle Walker. On 14 January, It was reported that Welbeck would sign a long-term contract at Old Trafford.
2012–13 season.
Welbeck started the first match of the season against Everton on 20 August 2012, which ended 1–0 to Everton. He was substituted for the much awaited star signing of the season, Robin Van Persie. On 22 August 2012 he signed a new four-year contract with Manchester United stating that playing for Manchester United is all he ever wanted. He scored his first goal of the season on 20 October, in a 4–2 win at home to Stoke City. On 13 February 2013, Welbeck scored a vital goal in a 1–1 draw against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, heading in from a Wayne Rooney corner, his first goal in almost 4 months. Welbeck's goal against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium made him the first Englishman to score for a Premier League team at the Bernabeu since Alan Smith in 2001. The England striker ended the season with a total of 2 goals in 40 appearances. 
2013–14 season.
Welbeck scored on the opening day of the season, scoring twice in a 4–1 win against Swansea City in new manager David Moyes' first league game as Manchester United manager. His next two league goals came in a 3–0 win against Aston Villa at Villa Park.
International career.
England youth squads.
Welbeck made his England Under-16s debut as a 14-year-old in October 2005 against Wales in the Victory Shield, which England won that year. He then progressed to the England Under-17s team, scoring the decider in a qualifying game against Serbia, to help his team progress to the 2007 UEFA U-17 European Championship. The tournament saw England finish as runners-up to Spain, which secured the team a place in the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Korea. There, Welbeck scored two goals against New Zealand, helping Scotland to reach the quarter-finals in their first involvement in the tournament. Welbeck was originally intended to be a squad member for England's European Under-19 Championship campaign in July 2008, but was forced to withdraw. He eventually made his debut for the Under-19s on 9 September 2008, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands.
Welbeck made his England under-21 debut on 10 February 2009, in the 3–2 loss to Ecuador, coming on for Adam Johnson. He followed this up with another substitute appearance in a 2–0 home defeat to France on 31 March. He was then named in Stuart Pearce's original 23-man squad for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in Sweden on 27 May, but he had to pull out of the squad on 31 May, due to an injury. On 7 September 2010, Welbeck scored his first two goals for the England under-21 team in a 3–0 win over Lithuania. He scored his third under-21 goal in a 4–0 away victory over Denmark on 24 March 2011. Welbeck then started the first game of England's campaign at the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship against Spain. Welbeck scored an 88th-minute equaliser as England began the tournament with a 1–1 draw.
England senior team.
On 18 November 2008, it was reported that the Ghana Football Association was keeping tabs on Welbeck, with a view to him representing the Ghana national team in the future. On 29 March 2011 Welbeck was called up to the England squad, for their friendly fixture against Ghana. Welbeck replaced Ashley Young in the 81st minute of a 1–1 draw with Ghana at Wembley Stadium. He has been further picked for the friendly against the Netherlands on 10 August 2011, however that match was called off due to the riots in London. He played in England's deciding Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on 7 October 2011, coming on as a substitute for Theo Walcott in the second half. On 29 May 2012, Welbeck was listed as a part of the confirmed 23-man squad for Roy Hodgson's England squad for UEFA Euro 2012. On 2 June 2012, he scored his first goal for England in a 1–0 win against Belgium, with a chip over goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after collecting a through ball from his Manchester United team-mate Ashley Young. On 15 June 2012, Welbeck scored a dramatic backheeled winning goal in the 79th minute as England beat Sweden 3–2 in Euro 2012 in Kiev.
Playing style.
Due to his height, running style, and skin colour, Welbeck has been compared to Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor and Nigerian striker Nwankwo Kanu, but styled his game on his boyhood hero Thierry Henry.
He has also been known for his work-rate and has been described as strong, quick, and very good in the air.
Critics have acknowledged the strength in Welbeck's style of play such as his work-rate, pace and intelligence in following tactical command, especially after his performance in both of the knock-out stage matches against Real Madrid.
Welbeck is regularly picked for England (amassed 11 appearances in year 2012) despite starting just handful of game at club level. With Roy Hodgson favouring the 4–3–3 formation, Welbeck's ability in supporting the attack, pressing the midfield and holding up the ball fit into the system.

1954–55 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1954–55 campaign saw Town make a brilliant start in their second season back in the 1st Division. Unfortunately, a disappointing mid-season ended any chance of Town improving on their 3rd place finish the previous season. They would eventually finish down in 12th place with 41 points, 7 points behind second placed Wolverhampton Wanderers. This was also the last season in which the leading goalscorer in Division 1 came from the club, when Jimmy Glazzard scored 32 goals.
Review.
After losing their first 3 matches, Town went on an impressive run of just 1 defeat in 12 matches, which included wins over Chelsea, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Portsmouth, the teams who would eventually be the top 3 at the end of the season. Other interesting results during the season were a 5–3 win over Arsenal at Highbury and a 6–4 defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux.
Jimmy Glazzard's 32 goals made him the top scorer in Division 1, but a depressing spell between mid-December and early April which saw Town fail to register a win in the league saw Town drop out of the top 5 of the table. However, Town's form in the FA Cup didn't reflect their league form, as they reached the 6th round for the first time since the 1938–39 season, before losing to Newcastle United in a replay at St James' Park. In the league they finished 12th with 41 points.

Walter Martin (rugby union)

Walter John Martin DCM (born 14 May 1883, Woodford, England) was a Wales international rugby union player. He played club rugby predominantly for Newport, captaining the side and played county rugby for Monmouthshire. While playing for Newport, Martin faced the three major Southern Hemisphere teams, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. At international level he represented Wales on three occasions.
Club career.
Martin joined Newport Rugby Club in 1904, and during his career would captain the club during one of the most successful era's for the club. At Newport he formed an incredibly successful partnership with Tommy Vile, and they would face the touring New Zealanders, South Africans and Australians together.
International career.
Martin made his debut for Wales against Ireland at the Balmoral Showgrounds on 9 March 1912 as part of the Five Nations Championship. In an inexperienced team, Martin was one of seven new caps, under the captaincy of Jack Bancroft, and although leading at half time the team lost 12-5. Despite the loss, Martin was back for the next match, and this time finished on the winning side. Martin did not play for Wales the next season, but was back after the First World War, in a game against the New Zealand Army, which is now recognised as an international game. Martin was not the first choice in the New Zealand game, as the selectors had chosen Cardiff's Clem Lewis, but Lewis had picked up an injury playing for the British Army team. Martin was drafted in as a late replacement but during the game injured his head saving a try. Martin was removed from play, but later recovered and resumed the game, although his play was not as strong after the event. Martin's three caps were all played in partnership with Newport team mate, Tommy Vile.

What Will Fat Cat Sit On?

What Will Fat Cat Sit On? is a 2007 children's picture book by Jan Thomas.
Plot.
Fat Cat wonders what to sit on. The animals are relieved that the cat will not sit on them, but they wonder about what the cat will have for lunch. The animals run off in terror.
Reception.
A "Publishers Weekly" review says, "Eschewing anything that smacks of a setting (except for the comfy chair to which Fat Cat is directed) she renders her barnyard characters in super-saturated colors and thick, bold outlines. Mood swings generally have a bad name these days, but Thomas makes them a hoot". Elizabeth Bird, of "School Library Journal" reviewed the book saying, "Arguably the best of the overweight kitty genre, this is a crowd pleaser and bound to be a children's librarian's new best friend. Funny furry stuff". Tasha Saecker, of Mensha Library, reviewed the book saying, "One of the best and easiest readers out there.

Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company

The Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company ("Leipzig-Dresdner Eisenbahn-Compagnie") or LDE was a private railway company in the Kingdom of Saxony, now a part of Germany. Amongst other things, it operated the route between Leipzig and Dresden, opened in 1839, and which was the first long-distance railway line in Germany. On 1 July 1876 the company was nationalised and became part of the Royal Saxon State Railways.
History.
The idea of building a railway to link Leipzig with Strehla (on the river Elbe), had already been put forward before 1830 by the Leipzig merchant, Carl Gottlieb Tenner. Tenner's idea gained new impetus after the state economist in Leipzig, Friedrich List, publicised his plans for a German railway system in 1833, in which it was envisaged that Leipzig would function as a central hub. That same year, a railway committee was founded which, on 20 November 1833, submitted a petition to the lower house of the Saxon Parliament ("Sächsischer Landtag") in Dresden for the construction of a railway from Leipzig to Dresden .
In 1835, the Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company was founded as a private company by twelve citizens of Leipzig, including: Albert Dufour-Féronce (1798–1861), Gustav Harkort (1795–1865), Carl Lampe (1804–1889) and Wilhelm Theodor Seyfferth (1807–1881). At the Easter trade fair in 1835 the shares of the company (nominally valued at 100 thaler) were fully subscribed within just a few hours, making a capital sum of over one million thalers available. On 6 May 1835 the Saxon state government authorised the construction and operation of the line as well as the issue of non-interest bearing bonds to the value of 500,000 thalers. The total capital generated thus amounted to 1.5 million thalers.
In October 1835 the British engineers Sir James Walker und Hawkshaw surveyed the proposed routes and recommended the northern route via Strehla (estimated cost: 1,808,500 thalers) over the route via Meißen (1,956,000 thalers). On 16 November 1835 the purchase of land began for the section between Leipzig and the Mulde bridge north of Wurzen. On 1 March 1836 the first sod was cut. Oversight for the entire project lay in the hands of the Saxon Senior Waterways Construction Engineer ("Oberwasserbaudirektors"), Karl Theodor Kunz.
Then however the town council of Strehla rejected the building of the railway. So the line was re-routed over the river Elbe 7 km further south at Riesa. On 7 April 1839 the first train ran over the Elbe railway bridge at Riesa. 
The route was taken into operation in several stages:
On 7 April 1839, on the completion of the Elbe bridge at Riesa, the entire route from Leipzig to Dresden was finally opened. A second track was built immediately afterwards and the route was then operated with traffic running on the left, in line with English practice until 1884!
From 1851 to 1878 a single-tracked, 5 km long, connecting railway was operated in Leipzig, that branched off from the Saxon-Bavarian Railway, ran eastwards around the city in a large curve and finally entered the Dresden railway north of Dresden station.
On 1 December 1860 the Leipzig-Dresden Railway opened a side line that branched off the main line in Coswig and ran to Meißen. On 14 May 1866 it opened services on another side line, which branched off the main route in Borsdorf and initially ran as far as Grimma; then on 28 October 1867 to Leisnig, on 2 June 1868 to Döbeln, on 25 October 1868 to Nossen and on 22 December 1868 it was finally extended as far as Meißen, so that a parallel southern route was established between Borsdorf and Coswig. 
The Großenhain branch, opened on 14 October 1862, went into to the ownership of the LDE on 1 July 1869.
On 15 October 1875 the LDE opened a connecting route from Riesa to Elsterwerda (since 1815 part of the Kingdom of Prussia), that from 17 July 1875 was linked to Berlin and Dresden.
The route from Nossen to Freiberg – as part of the line from Nossen to Moldau - was completed on 15 July 1873, and extended as far as Mulda/Sa. by 2 November 1875. On 15 August 1876 the route reached the Bohemian border at Moldau.
After the collapse of the Elbe bridge at Riesa, the general assembly of the shareholders decided on 29 March 1876 to sell the Dresden railway to the state of Saxony. On 1 July 1876 the operation and management of the Leipzig-Dresden Railway was transferred to the Royal Saxon State Railways.
The 'railway monument' in Leipzig, erected in 1878, commemorates the development of the Dresden railway from its emergence as a private initiative of Leipzig citizens to its nationalisation.

Aspera (band)

Aspera (initially Aspera Ad Astra) were an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
History.
Aspera formed in 1996 under the name Aspera ad Astra in Philadelphia, and released a 7" split with Haelah before issuing their debut full-length in 1998. Following this the group underwent lineup changes before the release of their 1999 EP; several drummers would join and leave the group until late 2000, when A.J. Edmiston joined. Around this time the group shortened its name. They began releasing material on Jagjaguwar Records in 2002, including a re-release of their 2001 album "Sugar & Feathered". 2007 saw "Back When Love" issued on Philadelphia label Burnt Toast Vinyl. Aspera were part of the so-called "Psychedelphia" scene, alongside bands such as Bardo Pond and The Lilys.
Aspera seems no longer to be a going concern. Tripp, Werth, and Edmiston, along with Carmine Degennaro, are now working with Ken Griffin, formerly of Irish band Rollerskate Skinny, as Favourite Sons. Drew Mills has formed the band Blood Feathers with Ben Dickey of Amen Booze Rooster.

André Chéron

André Chéron (September 25, 1895 - September 12, 1980) was a French chess player, endgame theorist, and a composer of endgame studies. He lived in Switzerland for many years. He was named a FIDE International Master of Chess Composition in 1959, the first year the title was awarded.
Chéron was the French champion three times (1926, 1927, and 1929) and played on the French team at the 1927 Chess Olympiad. He is best known for his work in the theory of endgames, where he was most concerned with detailed proofs about theoretical endgame results. He composed hundreds of endgame studies. His life's work is the monumental four-volume "Lehr- und Handbuch der Endspiele" (the German title), which was first published in French in 1952 and published in German in 1952–58 (and a second revised edition in 1962-70). It studies basic endgames and endgame studies, with material drawn from many sources including his own contributions. He also wrote "Traité complet d'échecs" and an updated version "Nouveau traité complet d'échecs", half of which was about the endgame.

Frankfurter Engel

The Frankfurter Engel (German for "Frankfurt angel") is a memorial in the city of Frankfurt am Main in southwestern Germany; it is dedicated to homosexual people who were persecuted under Nazi rule, and as well as under Paragraph /Section 175 of the German Criminal Code during the 1950s and 1960s.
Design.
The memorial is a statue of an angel and is the first of its kind in Germany. Subsequent memorials in Germany are Kölner Rosa Winkel (1995) in Cologne and Memorial to Homosexuals persecuted under Nazism (2008) in Berlin.
At the basis of the memorial written in the German language is: 
"Homosexuelle Männer und Frauen wurden im Nationalsozialismus verfolgt und ermordet. Die Verbrechen wurden geleugnet, die Getöteten verschwiegen, die Überlebenden verachtet und verurteilt. Daran erinnern wir in dem Bewusstsein, dass Männer, die Männer lieben, und Frauen, die Frauen lieben, immer wieder verfolgt werden können. Frankfurt am Main. Dezember 1994"
This can be translated to English as:
The memorial remembers homosexuals who were persecuted and/or died during the Nazi rule and Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code that outlawed homosexuality during the 1950s and 1960s. It was reformed in 1969 and fully repealed in 1973.
History.
On the 20th of July, 1992 a competition for the memorial design began. Ultimately, the winner of the competition was the artist Rosemarie Trockel, and the memorial was built at the crossing of the streets "Schäfergasse" and "Alte Gasse". On the 11th of December, 1994 the memorial was opened.

Dirt Don't Hurt

"Dirt Don't Hurt" is the second official album by Holly Golightly and the Brokeoffs, former members of the band Thee Headcoatees. It is a collaboration with her long-time band mate Lawyer Dave.
Reception.
Critical.
Mojo magazine said the album is "not much different (from their first album), and that's no bad thing with Holly Golightly and Lawyer Dave's self-produced duets recalling Leadbelly and Jimmy Reed, as well as the gospel recordings of Loretta Lynn and Nancy & Lee." However, Uncut magazine said it "sounds alarmingly authentic." "Pitchfork" magazine found the album "a heartily ramshackle affair, with pots and pans for percussion, rudimentary banjo picking, and what sound like first take on every track. The album's clattery rawness is its chief appeal." Allmusic said ""Dirt Don't Hurt" isn't necessarily magical, but it is fun and breezy, as well as a nice addition to Golightly's impressive catalog."

The World of Lee Evans

The World of Lee Evans was a BAFTA nominated TV show written by and starring Lee Evans and a range of actors, it followed Lee around getting stuck in tight situations and originally aired on Channel 4. The series was released on Channel 4 DVD in 2006 and features all episodes.
The humour, which differs greatly from Evans' later stand-up humour, contains many elements of slapstick, and the show is similar in style to "Mr. Bean". The series was a Granada Production in 1995 for Channel 4, and as Granada had adopted a new endboard cap at the end of their programmes at this time, "The World of Lee Evans" was amongst the first ever shows to use the endboard (the subtitle read "A GRANADA PRODUCTION FOR CHANNEL FOUR")
The series was quite popular though has had a very mixed reception in retrospect, some critics and Lee Evans fans saying the series is not as good as his other work.
The series' slogan is If Lee Evans "needs to get from A to B, he starts at Z...".

William Fox (actor)

William Hubert Fox TD (26 January 1911 – 20 September 2008) was a British character actor and writer. Fox enjoyed early success on the stage playing juvenile roles. After a six-year interruption for military service in World War II, his acting career did not reach the heights of his early years.
Early life.
Fox was born in Manila in the Philippines, the son of a successful trader who operated across the South China Sea. His parents travelled extensively and whilst still an infant he had visited Madrid, Paris and London. In 1916 Fox was sent to preparatory school, then attended Haileybury public school. He was expected to go on to Oxford University and thence into the petroleum industry; this was not to be. Fox read an advertisement in "The Times" inviting people to audition for the Central School of Speech and Drama founded by Elsie Fogerty. He won a scholarship but since he was from a wealthy family, the scholarship was only given on the condition that the money be passed on to the next person on the list. Fox's father agreed to fund Fox's studies only on the basis that Fox would complete what was normally a two-year course in a single year. He achieved this, and was awarded the school's gold medal upon graduating.
Pre-war career.
In 1930 Fox left drama school and won a role in London's West End performing in an eight-month run of W. Somerset Maugham's new play "The Breadwinner" at the Vaudeville Theatre. Following this success Fox co-founded an acting troupe, based in the West Country, where they converted a former swimming baths in Teignmouth into a theatre. He staged the thriller "Rope" and following a glowing review from actor Cyril Maude, the play had an eight-week sold-out run. In 1932 he married Carol Rees, who was seven years his senior and already pregnant with their daughter. The relationship did not survive the divergence of their careers. Rees petitioned for divorce in 1937.
Fox went on to perform in J.B. Priestley's play "Dangerous Corner", directed by Tyrone Guthrie; he was billed as "a great discovery". He rejected an offer to join the Broadway cast of the play, opting to join a company led by John Gielgud at the Old Vic Theatre. He played opposite Peggy Ashcroft in "As You Like It", and their performance was painted by Walter Sickert. 1934 was Fox's busiest year to date; he performed in five stage plays in the West End. One was "Precipice" a play about a ballet, which co-starred dancer Anton Dolin. After a short spell on Broadway, Fox returned to Britain. In the US he had been offered an audition by Warner Bros., but turned it down since his new love, Patricia Hillard was acting in Oxford. After being spotted dining together at the Savoy Grill by Priestley, who said he had never seen a couple "so much in love", they had a successful run in Priestley's play "I Have Been Here Before" which ran from 1937 until 1938.
Fox also acted in and wrote radio dramas. He often wrote under a pseudonym, as he didn't want his fellow actors to know he was the writer and sometimes made casting decisions. His first performance was in 1934 in Ibsen's "The Lady from the Sea".
In 1939 Fox and Hillard were living in Dolphin Square, where they became annoyed by their neighbour, Unity Mitford's, habit of playing loud Nazi marching songs. Inspired by this, and fortified by "lunch at L'Ecu de France", Fox joined the Territorial Army. While he was receiving military training he also happened to be playing a Nazi officer in a play called "Weep for the Spring", about life in Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. As a territorial soldier Fox was amongst the first to be called up in 1939 upon the declaration of war with Germany.
Military service.
Fox was an officer in the London Irish Rifles. He was initially trained to join a ski battalion which was to be sent to Finland to aid that country in the Winter War against the Soviet Union. However, an armistice was concluded before he reached the area; he then fought in the Battle of France, and was amongst those evacuated from Dunkirk. Following Staff College, Camberley, he spent the majority of the war stationed in North Africa and the Middle East. One of his roles involved helping to administer the meeting between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin in Tehran in 1943. After six years service Fox was demobbed with the rank of major (and had had a spell as an acting lieutenant-colonel). He later learned that in 1945, a few days before the liberation of Manila, his parents had been shot by the Japanese. After the war he continued to hold a reserve commission as a captain and honorary major until 1961, when he reached the age limit for service. He was awarded the Territorial Efficiency Decoration (TD) in 1967.
Post-war career.
After demobilisation Fox was considered too old to take on juvenile roles, and as he had no experience as a lead actor directors were wary of casting him in these parts. It was whilst in Baghdad that Fox decided to start the Reunion Theatre; this association was designed to help demobilised actors who had been out of the business for several years. The association did this by performing extracts from well-known plays and inviting agents and producers to watch. One actor who benefitted from this was Dirk Bogarde. After several successful productions Fox handed over the chairmanship of the Reunion Theatre to Laurence Olivier.
During the 1950s and '60s Fox's career was mixed; he did a season at Stratford and took on several West End comedies. The 1960s saw less theatrical roles; he did however perform in film, television and radio, for which he also wrote.
Fox started a wine merchant business and also dealt in antiques and pictures. These activities led to his devoting less time to acting though he continued to perform, notably in television shows such as "The Duchess of Duke Street", "When the Boat Comes In" and "Yes, Prime Minister". The late 1970s saw a return to theatre and the West End in a revival of T.S. Eliot's "The Family Reunion". He would also appear in an opera as Haushofmeister in Strauss’s "Ariadne auf Naxos" at Glyndebourne.
Personal life.
Fox was married twice. First aged 21, to the actress Carol Rees, with whom he had a daughter. His second wife was actress Patricia Hilliard, whom he first met in 1938 when they were in a play together. They had a son and a daughter together.
Fox was a member of the gentlemen's club, the Garrick Club and often spent time there in the company of Kenneth More and Kingsley Amis.

Metro Atlanta Project

Metro Atlanta Project is a nonprofit organization that empowers teens to reach out in their communities by addressing needs in the Atlanta area. Their work has focused on home repair and roofing projects, and is currently involved in playground construction.
History.
A youth group from Northside United Methodist Church conceived the idea for the Metro Atlanta Project while returning from a mission trip in Tennessee during the summer of 1997. They came to realize there was a great need in Atlanta for mission work, and the following summer that group recruited several others from Northside and organized various service projects in the Atlanta area.
Starting in 1999, the organization performed home repair tasks for low-income seniors through a partnership with Wesley Community Centers' Project Extend. In 2003, MAP shifted to focus its efforts solely on roofing. By 2010, the youth and volunteers from M.A.P. had provided over 143 families with new roofs in historic neighborhoods such as East Point, Bankhead, Union City, Dunwoody, and Decatur.
In 2011, MAP refocused its attention towards providing playground structures and equipment for daycare centers and children's homes. M.A.P. also worked with the DeKalb County Public School Board to construct a playground at an elementary school in Clarkston, Georgia. Since the spring of 2011, over 2,500 children safely enjoy the 22 playgrounds constructed by MAP at such diverse locations as daycare centers, schools, community churches, children's homes, and an apartment complex for families transitioning out of homelessness.
In the summer of 2013, more than 200 teenagers and scores of adult volunteers helped re-focus MAP to a wide variety of home repair tasks. MAP volunteers are excited to "meet the needs of senior citizens trying to live in a very tough economy."
Organization.
By the summer of 2011, M.A.P. had grown to involve over 250 youth. These youth volunteer from Northside United Methodist Church, Covington First United Methodist, Druid Hills Church, East Cobb United Methodist, Haygood Memorial United Methodist, Uplift Ministry, and Oak Grove United Methodist Church.
Also heavily involved are hundreds of adult volunteer coordinators who provide transportation, serve food, supervise construction tasks, coordinate logistics, and mentor the youth as they are housed in Northside UMC during the duration of the M.A.P. project.

The Wishing Tree

The Wishing Tree is an acoustic music project by Marillion's guitarist Steve Rothery and American vocalist Hannah Stobart. Their debut album, "Carnival of Souls", was released in 1996 and a second album, "Ostara", was released 23 March 2009.
History.
Rothery had been interested in starting an acoustic project with a female vocalist since 1985. At first All About Eve's singer Julianne Regan was approached through Marillion's manager John Arnison, but was not interested in working with Rothery. Later, an attempt to team up with the female singer of a band called The Escape Club (not The Escape Club), whose voice reminded Rothery of Annie Haslam's, failed as they couldn't get on on a personal level. When Marillion were recording Brave at Miles Copeland's Chateau Marouatte in Dordogne in 1993, Copeland offered Rothery "a substantial sum" for recording an instrumental solo album on his label No Speak. Although Rothery didn't take the offer, it renewed his interest in a solo project. During the Brave tour of 1994, Rothery was approached by Hannah Stobart, a student of French and Italian, who gave him her demo tape containing "She Moved Through the Fair" and Tori Amos's "Me and a Gun". Rothery was delighted and began recording further demos with Stobart at his new home studio. After Marillion were dropped by EMI following the 1995 album "Afraid of Sunlight", several band members pursued solo projects before they began work on "This Strange Engine" (1997). During two weeks in early 1996, Rothery recorded acoustic material with Stobart on vocals, Pete Trewavas of Marillion on bass and Paul Craddick of Enchant on drums and keyboards. All music was written by Rothery and Stobart ("additional vocal melodies"), while the lyrics were written by regular Marillion collaborator John Helmer. Most songs were written right then, however, a handful had a longer history: "Nightwater" was considered for Seasons End (1989), when Steve Hogarth rejected Helmer's lyrics as "too gothic"; the chorus of "Midnight Snow" and "Evergreen" were written during the "Holidays in Eden" (1991) and "Clutching at Straws" (1987) sessions, respectively. 
The resulting album was called "Carnival of Souls", after the horror film of the same title. The project's name was inspired by Tengiz Abuladze's film "The Wishing Tree" (aka "The Tree of Desire"). There was no tour to support the album, however, the band did appear live on a concert for Marillion's Italian fan club. They also appeared on Italian television.
After the release of "Carnival of Souls", Rothery returned to his main job with Marillion, leaving The Wishing Tree on an indefinite hiatus. Stobart finished her university studies, got married to Paul Craddick and settled down in California as a journalist. In 1999, Sony Music expressed interest in another Wishing Tree album, so Rothery and Stobart/Craddick recorded some demos that Rothery described as "a cross between Portishead and Alanis Morissette". However, Rothery hesitated to sign a major deal outside of Marillion and Sony finally lost interest. Still, Rothery and Stobart continued to work together. In 2002, the band played at a fan club convention ("Marillion Weekend"). 
On 29 January 2009, Rothery announced on marillion.com that The Wishing Tree's second album "Ostara" will be released on 23 March 2009, exclusively through marillion.com initially. It will be possible to preorder the album, and the first 1000 copies will be signed by Steve and Hannah. One of the tracks from the album, "Hollow Hills", has been prereleased for download from their webpage, along with other clips from the album.

From 1994, he worked as a consultant and author, including writing books on the Kennedys, Jay Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Burroughs, as well as best-selling books about computers and computing.
In 2006 and 2007, while serving as acting director of the Theodore Roosevelt Association, he stole letters by Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt from its archives, which he sold for about $97,000. In 2008 he pleaded guilty to a federal charge and a state charge related to the theft. He apologized for his actions, which he stated occurred during the manic phase of bipolar disorder which was undiagnosed at the time. "I alone am responsible for this one great, indelible stain which now and forever disfigures a life I am otherwise proud of", he said. In September 2008, he was sentenced to eighteen months in minimum security federal imprisonment and was fined $86,000 in restitution. Biographer T.J. Stiles cast doubts on the accuracy of certain claims in Renehan's book about Cornelius Vanderbilt, which was written during Renehan's manic period. Following his release he continued to work in publishing, including founding New Street Communications which is focused on digital and POD editions. On his website, he describes that medication he has taken since his diagnosis has stabilized his bipolar mood swings.
Renehan is married, has two children, and lives in Rhode Island. He has served on several nonprofit boards, including the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and that of the Southern Rhode Island Conservation District, and is active in the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association.

Junction (video game)

Junction is a video puzzle game developed by Micronet and published by Konami in 1990 that saw a western release. Using a variety of sliding puzzles, the player is challenged to roll a ball (possibly containing a small armadillo character as implied by the game's introduction) along tracks set on the tiles. Players must align the tracks together and have the ball roll over bridged tracks that have been set on the border of the puzzle in order to complete each level. Junction had a total of 50 levels and the player could select them as they wished, but a certain number of points had to be reached by level 50 in order for the player to beat the game and see the ending. 
The Sega Game Gear version had a reference to "Curse", a previous Micronet game, in its opening.

Tochinoshin Tsuyoshi

Career.
As a teenager he practised judo and sambo. He competed in amateur sumo at the World Junior Championships in 2004, held in Osaka, Japan and at the World Championships in 2005. He trained at the prestigious Nichidai sumo club at Nihon University and it was a member of that club who encouraged him to turn professional. 
At the beginning of 2006 he was recruited by the former "sekiwake" Tochinowaka. After eleven straight "kachi-koshi" or winning scores he gained "sekitori" status in January 2008 upon promotion to the 'jūryō" division and immediately took the "yūshō" or championship in that division with a 12-3 record. 
He took his first ever "make-koshi" or losing score in his top division debut in May 2008, but still won enough bouts to remain in the division. He reached "maegashira" 4 in November 2008, but facing the highest ranking men for the first time he could only record three wins against twelve losses. However, in July 2009 he produced a good score of 9-6 at "maegashira 5", and was promoted to his highest ever rank of "maegashira" 1 in the September tournament. He could manage only four wins there, but had the best result of his career to date in November, finishing runner-up to Hakuhō on 12-3 and winning his first special prize, Fighting Spirit. However, his defeat to Hokutōriki on the final day cost him a chance of making his debut in the titled "san'yaku" ranks in January 2010. 
In the May 2010 tournament he defeated four "ōzeki" in a row from Days 2 to 5 (becoming only the second man below "sekiwake" to achieve this, following Masurao in March 1987) and won his second Fighting Spirit prize (shared with Aran). He was rewarded with promotion to "komusubi" for the first time in the July 2010 tournament. He fell short with a 6-9 record, but returned to komusubi in November. 
In May 2011 he equalled his best ever top division performance, once again finishing runner-up to Hakuho on 12-3 and winning another Fighting Spirit prize. This saw him return to the "komusubi" rank for the July 2011 tournament. His poor performance in November, scoring only 2-13, could be attributed to the fact that he was banned from training before the tournament by his stablemaster as punishment for breaking "heya" rules on curfew and wearing Western style clothes in public.
He is on friendly terms with fellow countryman Kokkai, who helped him in his early days in Japan when he was suffering from homesickness.
Fighting style.
Tochinoshin favours "yotsu-sumo" techniques, preferring to grapple with rather than push his opponents. His favourite grip on the "mawashi" is "migi-yotsu", meaning he likes his right hand inside and his left hand outside his opponent's arms. His most common winning technique or "kimarite" is "yori kiri" or force out, but he also uses his left hand grip to good effect by regularly employing "uwatenage", or overarm throw.

Isaac H. Bromley

Isaac Hill Bromley (1833-1899) was an American lawyer, editor, politician, railroad director, possibly most notable as a humorist.
Biography.
Isaac Hill Bromley was born on March 6 1833 in Norwich, Connecticut. He was educated at Yale, but left in the November of his sophomore year, but was awarded a degree in 1868. 
He studied law at Norwich and New Haven and was admitted to the bar in 1854. In 1855 he edited a weekly newspaper, "The State Guard" in Norwich, where he married, on December 25, Miss Adelaide E. Roath. In January 1856 he formed a law partnership, but was soon diverted from it by his chosen profession, editorial journalism, and never returned to it. He was made Assistant Clerk of the State House of Representatives in 1856, Clerk in 1857, and Clark of the Senate on 1858.
In November 1858 he moved to Norwich and began the publication of a new paper, "The Bulletin". In August 1862 he enlisted in the 18th Connecticut Volunteers and was commissioned as Captain. He served for most of his time as Provost Marshal of the Third District of Connecticut until his resignation in March 1964. In 1866 he was elected to the legislature from Norwich.
In 1868 he moved to Hartford and took editorial control of the "Evening Post", with which he continued until 1972. In February 1873 he joined the editorial staff of the "New York Tribune" and remained with that paper for ten years. In the meantime, in June 1873, he was appointed by President Arthur as one of the Government Directors of the Union Pacific Railroad. After a series of brief editorial engagement with the "Commercial Adventurer" and the "Evening Telegram" of New York, and the "Rochester Post-Express", he became in 1884 Assistant to the President of the Union Pacific Railroad, and held that office until 1889. In October 1891, he resumed editorial work on the "New York Tribune", and continued in active service until a few months before his death.
In April 1898 after several years of poor health, he became seriously ill, and in June was removed to the Backus Hospital in Norwich, where he died from neuritis on August 11, in his 66th year. 
His Yale University obituary describes him thus: "A trenchant writer, gifted with a style of unusual brilliancy and unique in its quality of wit, he ranked easily among the leaders of his profession in his generation and was as warmly beloved as he was admired.

Disneyland with the Death Penalty

"Disneyland with the Death Penalty" is an article about Singapore written by William Gibson. His first major piece of non-fiction, it was first published as the cover story for "Wired" magazine's September/October 1993 issue (1.4). 
The article follows Gibson's observations of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is a reference to the authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking any sense of creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterised as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the South-East Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.
Though Gibson's first major piece of non-fiction, the article had an immediate and lasting impact. The Singaporean government banned "Wired" upon the publication of the issue, and the phrase "Disneyland with the death penalty" became a byword for bland authoritarianism that the city-state could not easily discard.
Synopsis.
The title "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" refers to the subject of the article, the Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore, whose strictly-guarded sterility Gibson describes with horror. After opening the article with the Disneyland metaphor, Gibson cites an observation attributed to Laurie Anderson that virtual reality "would never look real until they learned how to put some dirt in it" in relation to the immaculate state of the Changi Airtropolis, Singapore's international airport. Beyond the airport, he notes that the natural environment has been cultivated into "all-too-perfect examples of itself," such as with the abundance of golf courses. Singaporean society is a "relentlessly G-rated experience," controlled by a government akin to a megacorporation, fixated on conformity and behavioural constraint and with a marked lack of humour and creativity.
Gibson finds it painful to try to connect with the Victorian Singapore, of which few vestiges remained. In an attempt to uncover Singapore's underlying social mechanisms, the author searches fruitlessly for an urban underbelly, rising at dawn for jetlagged walks on several mornings only to discover that the city-state's "physical past … has almost entirely vanished". He gives an overview of the history of Singapore from the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 to the Japanese occupation and the establishment of the Republic in 1965. He concludes that modern Singapore, effectively a single-party state and capitalist technocracy, is a product first and foremost of the vision of three-decade Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. As an aside, he quotes a headline from the "South China Morning Post" detailing the trial of a cadre of economists, a government official (current Deputy Prime Minister, Tharman) and a newspaper editor for divulging a state secret by revealing the Singaporean economic growth rate.
Gibson deplores the absence of an authentic metropolitan feeling, something which he blames for the "telling lack of creativity". He gives a psychogeographic account of the architecture of the city-state, noting the endless parade of young, attractive and generically attired middle class through the host of shopping centers, and comparing the city-state to the convention district of Atlanta, Georgia. He finds the selection in music stores and bookshops unrelentingly bland, musing whether this is partially attributable to the efforts of the Undesirable Propagation Unit (UPU), one of several state censorship agencies. Amidst the near total absence of bohemianism and counterculture, Gibson finds no trace of dissidence, an underground, or slums. In the place of a sex trade, the author finds government-sanctioned "health centers" – in fact massage parlours – and mandatory dating organised and enforced by government agencies. "here is remarkably little", he writes of the city-state "that is not the result of deliberate and no doubt carefully deliberated social policy." 
The creative deficit of the city-state is evident to the author also in the Singaporeans' obsession with consumerism as a pastime, the homogeneity of the retailers and their fare, and in what he characterises as their other passion: dining (although he finds fault with the diversity of the food, it is, he remarks "something to write home about"). He returns then to the theme of the staid insipidity of the city-state, observing the unsettling cleanliness of the physical environment and the self-policing of the populace. In detailing Singaporean technological advancement and aspirations as an information economy, Gibson casts doubt on the resilience of their controlled and conservative nature in the face of impending mass exposure to digital culture – "the wilds of X-rated cyberspace". "Perhaps", he speculates, "Singapore's destiny will be to become nothing more than a smug, neo-Swiss enclave of order and prosperity, amid a sea of unthinkable...weirdness."
Toward the end of the essay, Gibson briefly covers two applications of the death penalty by the Singaporean justice system; he excerpts a report from "The Straits Times" about Mat Repin Mamat, a Malay man sentenced to death for attempting to smuggle a kilogram of cannabis into the city-state, and follows this with a description of the case of Johannes Van Damme, a Dutch engineer found with significant quantities of heroin with the same consequence. He expresses reservations about the justice of capital punishment and describes the Singaporeans as the true bearers of zero tolerance. After hearing the announcement of Van Damme's sentencing, Gibson decides to leave, checks out "in record time" from the hotel, and catches a cab to the airport. The trip is conspicuous for the absence of police along the road, but there is an abundance of them at the Changi Airtropolis, where Gibson photographs a discarded piece of crumpled paper, incurring their ire. Flying into Hong Kong he briefly glimpses the soon-to-be-destroyed shantytown Kowloon Walled City at the end of one of the runways at the chaotic Kai Tak Airport, and muses about the contrast with the staid and sanitised city-state he has left behind. The essay ends with the declaration "I loosened my tie, clearing Singapore airspace."
Impact and legacy.
The Republic of Singapore responded to the publication of the article by banning "Wired" from the country. The phrase "Disneyland with the death penalty" became a famous and widely-referenced description for the nation, adopted in particular by opponents of Singapore's perceived authoritarian nature. The city-state's authoritarian and austere reputation made it difficult to shake the description off; "Creative Review" hailed it as "famously damning", while "The New York Times" associate editor R.W. Apple, Jr. defended the city-state in a 2003 piece as "hardly deserving of William Gibson's woundingly dismissive tag line". Reviewing the work in a 2003 blog post, Gibson wrote the following:
Critical reception.
The article provoked a strong critical reaction. "The Boston Globe" characterised it as a "biting piece on the technocratic state in Singapore". It was recommended by postmodern political geographer Edward Soja as "a wonderful tour of the cyberspatial urbanities" of the city-state. Journalist Steven Poole called it a "horrified report", and argued that it showed that the author "despises the seamless, strictured planes of corporate big business" and is "the champion of the interstitial". In a review of Gibson's 2010 novel "Zero History" for "The Observer" James Purdon identified "Disneyland" as one of the high points of Gibson's career, "a witty, perceptive piece of reportage, hinting at a non-fiction talent equal to the vision that had elevated Gibson to digital-age guru."
Philosopher and technology writer Peter Ludlow interpreted the piece as an attack on the city, and noted as ironic the fact that the real Disneyland was in California—a state whose "repressive penal code includes the death penalty". Urban theorist Maarten Delbeke noted that Gibson cited the computerised control of the city-state as responsible for its sanitised inauthentic character, a claim Delbeke called "a conventional, almost old-fashioned complaint against technocracy". In a 2004 article in "Forum on Contemporary Art & Society", Paul Rae commented that "an ability to capture the zeitgeist is to be taken seriously in a context such as this one, Gibson’s journalistic reportage is inevitably unrefined", and cited the accusation of Singapore-based British academic John Phillips that Gibson "fails to really think [his critiques through".
In "S,M,L,XL" (1995), urbanist and architectural theorist Rem Koolhaas took issue with the acerbic, ironic tone of the article, condemning it as a typical reaction by "dead parents deploring the mess children have made of their inheritance." Koolhaas argued that reactions like Gibson's imply that the positive legacy of modernity can only be intelligently used by Westerners, and that attempts such as Singapore's at embracing the "newness" of modernity without understanding its history would result in a far-reaching and deplorable eradication.
Singaporean Tang Weng Hong in turn wrote a critical response to both Gibson and Koolhaas.

Ronald Lindsay

Sir Ronald Charles Lindsay, (3 May 1877 – 21 August 1945), was a British civil servant and diplomat. He was Ambassador to Turkey from 1925 to 1926 and to Germany from 1926 to 1928, Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs from 1928 to 1930 and Ambassador to the United States from 1930 to 1939.
Background and education.
Lindsay was the fifth son of James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford, by Emily Florence Bootle-Wilbraham, daughter of Colonel the Honourable Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, second son of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale. David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford, was his elder brother. He was educated at Winchester.
Career.
Lindsay was appointed Third Secretary in the Diplomatic Service in January 1901, and advanced to First Secretary in 1911. From 1913 to 1919 he was Under-Secretary of Finance for Egypt, and was made a Grand Officer of the Order of the Nile by the Sultan of Egypt in 1915. From 1919 to 1920 he was Councillor of the Embassy in Washington D.C., before being posted as Minister Plenipotentiary to France in September 1920. Following this, in 1921, he was appointed the Assistant Under-Secretary of State for the Foreign Office, a post he held until 1924. In 1925, he was appointed the Ambassador to Turkey and was sworn of the Privy Council later that year. In 1926, he moved to become Ambassador to Germany. He returned to London in 1928 to become the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the civil service head of the Foreign Office. After two years as Permanent Secretary, Lindsay was named as the Ambassador to the United States in November 1929 and took up the position early the next year. He was the first ambassador to move into the brand-new British embassy in 1930, and remained in Washington for almost a decade, retiring in June 1939 to be replaced by Lord Lothian.
Lindsay was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1908, a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1922, a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1924, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1926.
Personal life.
Lindsay was married twice, both times to Americans; in 1909 to Martha Cameron, daughter of J. Donald Cameron and his wife Elizabeth Sherman Cameron; after her death in April 1918, he married Elizabeth Sherman Hoyt, daughter of Colgate Hoyt, in 1924. Both wives were grandnieces of William Tecumseh Sherman. There were no children from either marriage. Lindsay died in August 1945, aged 68. Lady Lindsay died in September 1954, aged 68.

<doc id="19444970" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19444970" title="Dark flow">
Dark flow

Dark flow is an astrophysical term describing a possible non-random component of the peculiar velocity of galaxy clusters. The actual measured velocity is the sum of the velocity predicted by Hubble's Law plus a possible small and unexplained (or "dark") velocity flowing in a common direction. As of late 2013, it is disputed whether data from the Planck spacecraft shows statistically-significant evidence of "dark flow".
According to standard cosmological models, the motion of galaxy clusters with respect to the cosmic microwave background should be randomly distributed in all directions. However, analyzing the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data using the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, astronomers Alexander Kashlinsky, F. Atrio-Barandela, D. Kocevski and H. Ebeling found evidence of a "surprisingly coherent" 600–1000 km/s
Since then, the authors have extended their analysis to additional clusters and the recently released WMAP five-year data.
Location.
The dark flow was determined to be flowing in the direction of the Centaurus and Hydra constellations. This corresponds with the direction of the Great Attractor, which is a gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the Norma Cluster, located about 250 million light-years away from the Milky Way.
In a study from March 2010, Kashlinsky extended his work from 2008, by using the 5-year WMAP results rather than the 3-year results, and doubling the number of galaxy clusters observed from 700. The team also sorted the cluster catalog into four "slices" representing different distance ranges. They then examined the preferred flow direction for the clusters within each slice. While the size and exact position of this direction display some variation, the overall trends among the slices exhibit remarkable agreement. "We detect motion along this axis, but right now our data cannot state as strongly as we'd like whether the clusters are coming or going," Kashlinsky said. 
The team has so far catalogued the effect as far out as 2.5 billion light-years, and hopes to expand its catalog out further still to twice the current distance.
Criticisms.
Astrophysicist Ned Wright posted an online response to the study arguing that its methods are flawed. The authors of the "dark flow" study released a statement in return, refuting three of Wright's five arguments and identifying the remaining two as a typo and a technicality that do not affect the measurements and their interpretation.
A more recent statistical work done by Ryan Keisler claims to rule out the possibility that the dark flow is a physical phenomenon because Kashlinsky et al. do not consider the primary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as important as they are.
NASA's Goddard Space Center considered that this could be the effect of a sibling universe or a region of space-time fundamentally different from the observable universe. Data on more than 1,000 galaxy clusters have been measured, including some as distant as 3 billion light-years. Alexander Kashlinsky claims these measurements show the universe's steady flow is clearly not a statistical fluke. Kashlinsky said: "At this point we don't have enough information to see what it is, or to constrain it. We can only say with certainty that somewhere very far away the world is very different than what we see locally. Whether it's 'another universe' or a different fabric of space-time we don't know." Laura Mersini-Houghton and Rich Holman observe that some anisotropy is predicted both by theories involving interaction with another universe, or when the frame of reference of the CMB does not coincide with that of the universe's expansion.
In 2013, data from the European Space Agency's Planck satellite was claimed to show no statistically significant evidence of existence of dark flow. However, another analysis by a member of the Planck collaboration, Fernando Atrio-Barandela, suggested the data were consistent with the earlier findings from WMAP. Popular media continued to be interested in the idea, with Mersini-Houghton claiming the Planck results support existence of a multiverse.
