Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory

EMSL (pronounced em-zul), or the William R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, is a national scientific user facility located at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington. EMSL is funded by the Department of Energy’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research. EMSL provides experimental and computational resources to address the environmental molecular science challenges facing DOE and the nation.
EMSL offers the global scientific community a range of capabilities and expertise. Access to EMSL’s capabilities is gained through a peer-reviewed proposal process. If a proposal is accepted and the scientist publishes in the open literature, there typically is no charge for using the EMSL instrumentation and capabilities. EMSL provides proposal opportunities throughout the year.
Since it opened in 1997, scientists from all 50 states and more than 35 countries have used EMSL to support their scientific efforts.
Research.
Research at EMSL is focused on gaining an understanding of the physics, chemistry and biology governing environmental processes starting at the molecular scale and propagating to larger scales. EMSL’s research focus has been defined into three science themes.
Capabilities.
EMSL capabilities include:
EMSL facilities include a Quiet Wing that opened in early 2012 and a Radiochemistry Annex opening to the global user community in spring 2014.
Expertise.
EMSL staff and scientific consultants are experts in chemical, physical, biological and computational sciences. They have received numerous awards, been named to society fellowships, have received patents and publish in scientific journals. Since 2009, EMSL staff members have received nearly two dozen awards and honors. In fiscal year 2010, EMSL staff and user research appeared in more than 350 articles, including many in journals, such as "Science", "Nature", "Proceedings of the National Academy of Science" and "Journal of the American Chemical Society".
History.
The beginnings (1986–1997)
The idea that would become EMSL began in 1986 with a National Academy of Sciences report entitled "Opportunities in Chemistry". The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. Then director of PNNL William R. Wiley and lab senior managers met to discuss the report and how PNNL could respond to the nation’s scientific challenges that were critically dependent on fundamental advances in chemistry. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.
Wiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. “Problems don’t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,” said Wiley.
Ohio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for the U.S. Department of Energy, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to establish the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists and staff to support these programs.
The DOE authorized PNNL to proceed in October 1993, and PNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994. The facility was dedicated on October 16, 1996, in honor of Wiley, who died three months earlier. Construction was completed in August 1997. Then-DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary delivered the dedication speech and Wiley’s wife, Gus, cut the ribbon. EMSL opened Oct. 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE’s newest national scientific user facility.
The early years (1997–2001)
During its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere – critical challenges addressed by DOE.
EMSL’s early user program focused on single investigator studies – particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries – and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.
A maturing program (2001–2009)
In this period there were two grand challenges. These challenges were team-based, multi-investigator research efforts targeted on two key challenges related to DOE missions:
EMSL’s management further defined the lab’s research focus by establishing science themes. Started in 2006 as four themes and later focused to three, these Science Themes are:
In January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center to accommodate a more powerful supercomputer. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. At the same time, EMSL management began pursuing plans for a Radiochemistry Annex and a Quiet Wing.
Building for the future (2009 to present)
In 2009, DOE announced a $60 million investment in capabilities for EMSL from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or ARRA. EMSL used the funds to upgrade some existing capabilities, as well as developing and deploying totally new systems and capabilities.
At this same time, EMSL directed capital funds toward construction of the $8 million Quiet Wing to house up to eight microscopy instruments. The Quiet Wing opened in early 2012. Additionally, EMSL moved forward with plans for a radiological chemistry capability with a Radiochemistry Annex, slated to open in 2014.

Wan Smolbag Theatre

Wan Smolbag Theatre is a non-government organisation based in Vanuatu but operating all over the South Pacific. Wan Smolbag Theatre is primarily a development theatre group aiming to create awareness and engagement with issues surrounding education, health, governance, the environment, youth and gender.
Wan Smolbag has expanded from a voluntary theatre group to include a reproductive health clinic, a youth centre, a conservation network and a sports centre. Wan Smolbag is core funded by AustralianAid and the New Zealand Agency for International Development and produces materials such as a television show, DVDs, booklets and posters for education and training in communities, NGOs, schools and government departments throughout the South Pacific and the world.
WSB had over 140 full-time and part-time staff: actors, director, scriptwriter, finance and administrative staff, graphic artists, nurses, peer educators, youth workers, film and radio technicians, and managers. WSB has its base at converted warehouses in Tagabe, Port Vila, but also has a youth centre on the island of Pentecost, and a reproductive health clinic and youth centre in Luganville, Santo. WSB has two associate theatre groups on the outer islands; Haulua Theatre based on Pentecost and Wuhuran Theatre based on Ambrym. WSB also has a network of over 400 volunteer turtle conservation monitors (Vanua-tai monitors) based on islands throughout Vanuatu.
History.
Wan Smolbag Theatre (WSB) was established in Port Vila, Vanuatu in 1989. It began as an amateur theatre group with 15 voluntary actors. Since that time WSB has established a national and regional reputation as a development theatre organisation that produces and delivers locally produced, high-quality film, radio and theatre productions that are complemented by a range of workshop and printed materials. Coupled with structured workshops facilitated by actors, the organisation uses drama to inform, raise awareness and encourage public discussion on a range of contemporary health, lifestyle, environment and governance issues.
The use of development theatre has led WSB into other areas such as reproductive health clinic, youth centres, and a rural-based conservation network. In 1997, WSB spent six months working closely with the Blacksands/Tagabe peri-urban settlement community, which has high levels of unemployment and illiteracy. During that time, a community play was developed, and research was conducted into many issues affecting the contemporary daily lives of community members. As result of that collaboration, WSB initiated a new reproductive health clinic (Kam Pusum Hed or KPH) at its base in Port Vila. KPH has gone on to be a model for the region of a confidential, youth-friendly reproductive health service. They have also duplicated the KPH model in Santo, with the Northern Youth Care Clinic.
In December 2002, WSB was awarded the Pacific People of the Year accolade by "Islands Business" magazine.
WSB had over 140 full-time and part-time staff: actors, director, scriptwriter, finance and administrative staff, graphic artists, nurses, peer educators, youth workers, film and radio technicians, and managers. WSB has its base at converted warehouses in Tagabe, Port Vila, but also has a youth centre on the island of Pentecost, and a reproductive health clinic and youth centre in Luganville, Santo. WSB has two associate theatre groups on the outer islands; Haulua Theatre based on Pentecost and Wuhuran Theatre based on Ambrym. WSB also has a network of over 400 volunteer turtle conservation monitors (Vanua-tai monitors) based on islands throughout Vanuatu.
In July 2009, WSB celebrated its 20th year of existence with performances of a new play called "40 Dei" (40 days), and by inviting several overseas acts to come and participate in a 20th Anniversary Festival in Port Vila. Overseas performers included Polytoxic Dance Company from Brisbane, Nuffield Theatre from Southampton, UK, Kurruru Theatre, Diat Alferink and Steve Noonan all from Adelaide, Cie Les Kidams from Nouméa, Seini F. Taumoepeau from Sydney and New Zealand's Te Rakau.
The acting group is currently (April 2011) in rehearsal for their next major play "Zero Balans" and has just managed to secure funding for the fifth season of the TV drama "Love Patrol".
Productions.
Coupled with structured workshops facilitated by actors, Wan Smolbag Theatre organisation uses drama to inform, raise awareness and encourage public discussion on a range of contemporary health, lifestyle, environment, and governance issues.
Wan Smolbag Theatre also produces Love Patrol, Vanuatu’s first locally produced television show. Love Patrol is a police drama that seeks to engage the public on the causes and impacts of the spread of HIV in the region, as well as a number of other social and political issues. It is produced with funding with from AustralianAid and is accompanied by resource books and lesson plans for use in classrooms and workshops.
To provide a means to tell the stories of disabled people in Vanuatu, Wan Smolbag formed the Rainbow Disability Theatre, which also acts as a support and solidarity group for the actors within it.
Wan Smolbag’s health programme is also supported by the Healthforce theatre group, which engages communities throughout Vanuatu on issues of health, wealth management, nutrition, and sanitation.
Services.
KPH Clinic.
Wan Smolbag Theatre’s health programme also includes several reproductive health clinics in Port Vila and Luganville and nurses make monthly trips to the island of Pentecost to run a clinic at the Wan Smolbag youth centre there.
The clinics offer counselling, family planning, STI counselling and treatment, Voluntary Confidential Counselling and Testing (VCCT), condoms, peer education, outreach programmes and a mobile clinic.
Youth Centre.
Wan Smolbag Theatre runs two urban youth centres and one rural youth centre in Port Vila, Luganville and the island of Pentecost. The youth centres are aimed at the large number of unemployed and out of school youth throughout Vanuatu. They provide informal classes, workshops, and activities e.g. hip hop, nutrition, music, sewing, agriculture, and sport.
Sports Centre.
Since 2005, Wan Smolbag has offered youth the opportunity to learn and participate in sports, such as futsul, hockey, basketball, and volleyball. The teams have entered a number of international tournaments and a number of youth have gone abroad for training and competitions.
Nutrition Centre.
At the main location in Vila, Wan Smolbag offers cooking and nutrition classes to local youth and provides workshops for schools, women at the market, and cooks. Some workshops are partnered with the Ministry of Health.
The centre also provides a nutritious lunch for all staff, youth, and the wider community.
Environment.
Wan Smolbag’s environment programme focuses on encouraging and supporting community responsibility for the sustainable use of their resources. The programme has dealt with the issues of sustainable tourism, sea cucumber farming and turtle conservation via education programmes, plays, publications and the creation of the Vanua-Tai conservation network. Vanua-Tai monitors and protects populations of hawksbill turtles throughout Vanuatu.

All City (album)

All City is the fourth studio album from Western Australian hip hop group, Downsyde. It was released in October 2008 through their new label, Illusive Sounds.
This album differs from the group's previous efforts in that it doesn't focus on Australian guest MCs, other than the appearance of Porsah Laine.
"With this album we wanted to feature vocalists of a different sort, and we felt that with certain tracks we wanted a chorus or a hook that could mould quite easily into our vocals. We didn't want obvious choices, we wanted vocalists that engage you straight away. We wanted things to smack the listener in the head, like being hit by a baseball bat." - Optamus
"I said in passing to Armee, 'Dude let's try to get him (Guru) on a track.' So I said 'Let's just get in contact with his tour manager and send him "When the Dust Settles" and see what he has to say.' I though that there was no harm in trying. Sure enough, the tour manager contacted us, and Daz ran off something like 30 beats onto a CD and we express posted it over to him as soon as we could. There was one beat on there that he was really feeling (which eventually transformed into "Watucamehere 4") and before going back to the States he had one layover day. The heavens opened up and on that Sunday we went 'bang let's book a studio and knock it out.' On that Sunday I was hungover, but there - we were in the studio with Mr. Guru, slash "Jazzmatazz", himself." - Optamus
The album reached #26 on the ARIA Urban Albums charts. On 17 November 2008 Triple J announced that "All City" was their feature album for that week. 
Track listing.
All songs written by Shahbaz Rind, D. Reutens, Scott Griffiths, Mat Cheetham and Damien Allia, unless otherwise noted.

<doc id="19642960" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19642960" title="Ioanella">
Ioanella

Ioanella is a frazione (outlying area) of the Commune of Torricella Sicura in the Province of Teramo, Italy
History.
Some believe that the origins of the name Ioanella derive from the Latin "ioaria" or "iuaria" in reference to a small feudal holding within which a given judicial body had authority. Several ancient documents refer to the area as "Giovannel", "Giovannella", "Giovannello", "Ioanello", "Iuganello", "Iuvanello", or "Joanella".
In feudal times the area fell under the contado (administrative jurisdiction) of Teramo within a larger region then known as the ""Stato di Bisegno"" (State of Bisegno). Nearby San Giovanni a Scorzone received much benefit from the numerous vassal holdings in Ioanella.
During the Middle Ages Ioanella became a Università (an ancient term corresponding to what is know today's comil corrispettivo di un attuale comune) col nome di Santa Maria di Ioanella. In 1813 Ioanella was placed under the jurisdiction of the Commune of Torricella Sicura). It was not until after WWII that the road leading to Ioanella was paved, this replacing a previously used mule trail leading from Villa Popolo and dating back several centuries or more. In 1951 Ioanella, along with 22 other similar locals, was designated a frazione of Torricella Sicura. By 1967 the number of "frazione" had risen to 37. Near Ioanella are even smaller clusters houses in locations known as Casanova, Villa Colle, Case Marcozze, Case Manare and Case di Pompa.
Abitanti.
Ioanella has never been a large or even middle size city. In 1804 the village had only 31 inhabitants. Ten years later this number had increased to only 50 individuals. In the mid and late 20th century Ioanella grew from 85 inhabitants in 1951 to a population of 146 in 1981.
Public education.
In 1878 Italy passed a law (Legge Coppino) requiring free public education through the third grade. Teachers for classes in Ioanella and Borgonovo were selected by the communal officials in the town of nearby Torricella Sicura. A suitable location for this instruction could not be found in Ioanella and therefore these classes were established in the nearby villages of Piano Grande and Antanemuccio. Several years later Ioanella finally had its own small classroom attended by elementary age students of mixed ages. In 1888 the village classroom was transferred from Ioanella to Poggio Valle so that students from both of these localities, approximately equal in size, could be served together. In 1891 the classroom was transferred back to Ioanella. Following this move a compromise was reached in which classes would be held every two years in Ioanella and would be held in alternate years in Poggio Valle. This rotation of classrooms lasted until 1911 when the decision was made to hold classes solely in Ioanella. In the early 1950s an elementary school was constructed in the village center. Additional work on this structure was carried out in the 1960s.
Churches.
S. Maria Assunta.
The main village church is Chiesa di Santa Maria (Church of Saint Mary). One document from the early 14th century lists just under 100 parishioners. 
In the late 16th century the church had a congregation of approximately 500 individuals. The church itself received recognition from the Italian Ministry of the Interior as a civil in the mid-1980s. This beautiful church contains several 17th and 18th century works of art attributed to the Teramo artist Vincenzo Baldati.
Santa Barbara.
The church of Santa Barbara is located a few hundred meters from the highest summit of Ioanella. Surrounding the church are five houses of vassals once under the auspices of a nearby church, San Giovanni in Scorzone. Prior to the end of the 16th century Santa Barbara was governed by its own rectorate.
The Quarry.
Ioanella is well known for several quarries which are located not far from the village center. Material from these quarries were used in the construction of several of Teramo's main buildings. These include the Cathedral of Teramo, the Church of San Francisco and the Governor's Palace.

2009 Washington Nationals season

The Washington Nationals' 2009 season was the fifth season for the American baseball franchise of Major League Baseball in the District of Columbia, and the 41st since the original team was started in Montreal, Canada. It involved the Nationals attempting to win the National League East Division after a disappointing 59–102 season the year before.
On July 12, manager Manny Acta was fired and replaced with bench coach Jim Riggleman, though only as an interim manager. Under Acta, the Nationals compiled an MLB worst 26–61 record in 2009 through the All-Star break and a 158–252 record in Acta's three seasons with the Nationals. Riggleman would be named full-time manager in November 2009.
The Nationals finished the year with a 59–103 record, worse than the year before by one loss.
Nationals' third baseman Ryan Zimmerman won a Gold Glove Award as the best defensive third baseman in the National League and a Silver Slugger Award as the best offensive third baseman in the league.
Changed uniforms.
For this season, the Nationals have altered their uniforms. The interlocking "DC" has been removed from the star-spangled circle and now sits alone on left sleeve of both the home and away uniforms. It also has been removed from the alternate red jersey and replaced with the "pretzel W" from the team's cap. A new navy alternate jersey with the interlocked "DC" on the left chest in a "stars and stripes" flag pattern, which has also been emulated on the alternate navy cap, will be worn several times in 2009. Finally, in a tribute to the former baseball teams in the District of Columbia, a script writing of the city name has replaced the block lettering, emulating the script of the 1950s and 1960s – though as those teams used "Senators" on both their home and away uniforms, this marks the first time the curled W has actually appeared as part of the word "Washington" on an MLB jersey.
The uniforms gained notoriety when on April 17 in a game against the Florida Marlins, the jerseys of Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Dunn read "Natinals" on the front of the jersey instead of "Nationals" for the first three innings of the game. The Nationals did not catch the error as they only checked the back of the shirts, not the front, but were able to assign to Dunn and Zimmerman the correct jerseys later in the game. The company who manufactured the jerseys, Majestic Athletic, apologized for the error.
Player stats.
Batting.
"Note: G = Games played; AB = At Bats; R = Runs scored; H = Hits; 2B = Doubles; 3B = Triples; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in; AVG = Batting average; SB = Stolen bases"

"Note: W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; G = Games pitched; GS = Games started; SV = Saves; IP = Innings pitched; R = Runs allowed; ER = Earned runs allowed; BB = Walks allowed; K = Strikeouts" 
Minor League System.
The future for the Nationals seems to show promise with their Gulf Coast League affiliate qualifying for the playoffs. The significance of this to the 2009 Major League team is that it demonstrates that the team is attempting to improve on its performance and has the prospects to do so.

Dikko Affair

The Dikko Affair was a joint Nigerian-Israeli attempt to kidnap Umaru Dikko, a former Nigerian civilian government minister living in the United Kingdom, in 1984, and secretly transport him back to Nigeria in a diplomatic bag. After it was foiled, the political fallout seriously damaged relations between Nigeria and the United Kingdom for years.
Background.
Dikko was an influential Transport Minister in the civilian administration of President Shehu Shagari, his brother-in-law. In 1983, the Nigerian government was overthrown in a military coup led by Major-General Muhammadu Buhari, and a new military government led by Buhari was established. On his second day in power, Buhari issued a list of former government officials accused of a variety of crimes. Dikko, who topped the list, was accused of embezzling several million dollars in oil profits from the national treasury. Despite strenuous efforts to locate him, Dikko vanished, leaving no trace of his whereabouts. Dikko moved to the UK and settled in London, and became a vocal critic of the regime in exile. 
Though Israel, at the time, did not have formal diplomatic relations with predominantly Muslim Nigeria, there were less visible ties between the two nations. In particular, Nigeria was an important source of oil for Israel, and Israel was a significant supplier of arms to Nigeria. The Israeli national intelligence agency Mossad was recruited to locate and bring Dikko back to Nigeria to stand trial.
The kidnapping.
Mossad sources across Europe were mobilized, but all failed to locate any trace of Dikko. However, Mossad Director-General Nahum Admoni decided that Dikko was probably in London, which had become a haven for Nigerian exiles critical of the new regime. Mossad "katsas", accompanied by Nigerian security service agents led by ex-Nigerian Army Major Mohammed Yusufu, traveled to London. The Nigerian team rented an apartment on Cromwell Road and posed as refugees from the new regime. The Mossad agents rented rooms in hotels catering to tourists from Africa, and posed as anti-apartheid activists. Working separately, the two teams moved among the Nigerian expat community in London, gradually narrowing their search to West London, to the area around Hyde Park, where many wealthy Nigerian exiles lived. They combed the electoral registers freely available in the area's town halls, but found no trace of Dikko.
On 30 June 1984, a Mossad agent driving down Queensway spotted Dikko. He parked the car and then tailed Dikko on foot to his house in Porchester Terrace. Admoni was immediately informed, and ordered constant surveillance on the house. From then on, house was constantly watched, while the Nigerians, using their London embassy as a base, prepared a kidnapping operation. Meanwhile, the Mossad recruited Dr. Levi-Arie Shapiro, an Israeli doctor who was a consultant anesthetist and director of the intensive care unit at HaSharon Hospital, to fly to London and participate in the operation. Shapiro's job would be to drug Dikko, and insert an endotracheal tube to keep him from choking on his own vomit while being transported in a crate.
Late in the evening of 3 July 1984, a Nigeria Airways Boeing 707 arrived at Stansted Airport from Lagos. The aircraft had arrived empty, and the pilot notified the authorities that the plane had arrived to pick up diplomatic baggage from the Nigerian embassy. On board were several Nigerian security guards, who openly identified themselves as such and stated that they were there to protect the baggage. Their presence was reported to Scotland Yard's Special Branch. The following day, Dikko was kidnapped in front of his home while he was out for a walk and taken away in a van driven by Yusufu. He was then drugged into unconsciousness by Shapiro. However, the abduction was witnessed by Dikko's secretary, Elizabeth Hayes, who quickly notified the authorities.
Dikko and Shapiro were placed in one crate (dimensions 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.5 meters), while Mossad agents Alexander Barak and Felix Abithol occupied a second. However, proper documentation that would have ensured that the cargo could not be inspected was not provided. The crates were not labeled as diplomatic bags, as required by Article 27(4) of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As a result, customs officials who had received an all-points bulletin alerting them to the kidnapping while the crates were being processed at the airport, were able to open the crates without violating the convention and foil the kidnapping. Dikko was taken to a hospital; he was uninjured.
Seventeen men were arrested; four were convicted and sentenced to prison terms of 10 to 14 years: Shapiro, Barak, Abithol, and Yusufu. All four were released after serving between six and eight and a half years, and were quietly deported. In retaliation, two British engineers in Nigeria were arrested and given fourteen-year prison sentences.
Repercussions.
The Nigerian and Israeli governments never admitted any connection to the incident. Nonetheless, the British government immediately expelled two members of the Nigerian High Commission in London, including the High Commissioner. Diplomatic relations with Nigeria were broken off for two years. The CEO of Nigeria Airways was at one point almost arrested by British police. In the aftermath of the affair, Nigeria filed a formal extradition request for Dikko, but it was refused. The Nigerian governments war against the previous government's corruption was also weakened, as the British governments also rejected Nigerian requests to extradite other politicians wanted in Nigeria on corruption charges and living in exile in Britain.
Dikko was eventually asked to return to Nigeria. He accepted the invitation and set up a political party.

List of examples of convergent evolution

Convergent evolution—the evolution of similar traits in unrelated lineages (usually geographically distant)—is rife in nature, as illustrated by the examples below. The ultimate cause of convergence is usually a similar evolutionary biome, as similar environments will select for similar traits in any species occupying the same ecological niche, even if those species are only distantly related. In the case of cryptic species, it can create species which are only distinguishable by analysing their genetics. Unrelated organisms often develop analogous structures by adapting to similar environments.
In fungi.
There are a variety of saprophytic and parasitic organisms that have evolved the habit of growing into their substrates as thin strands. This is most typical of the "true" fungi, but it has also evolved in Actinobacteria (bacteria), oomycetes (stramenopiles, like kelp), parasitic plants, and rhizocephalans (parasitic barnacles).
In proteins, enzymes and biochemical pathways.
Proteins undergoing functional convergence.
Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar functions with different structure.
Proteins undergoing structural convergence.
Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar tertiary structures but different functions. Whole protein structural convergence is not thought to occur but some convergence of pockets and secondary structural elements have been documented.

Australian Water Safety Council

The Australian Water Safety Council (AWSC) was officially formed in February 1998 as a result of strong industry consultation and with the support of the then Federal Minister for Sport & Tourism, The Honourable Andrew Thomson MP. 
The Australian Water Safety Council acts as a consultative forum comprising the major water safety and related government agencies and focuses on the presentation of key water safety issues to governments, industry and the community.
The Australian Water Safety Council does not represent an additional layer of organisational bureaucracy and does not receive funding directly. The Council provides a collective voice for its member organisations. It liaises closely with kindred bodies at State, National and International levels.
The AWSC is committed to improving Water Safety in Australia as demonstrated through the production and implementation of two National Water Safety Plans. These plans have generated bipartisan support for Water Safety in Australia and have seen the improvement of Water Safety throughout the country. The AWSC member bodies continue to demonstrate their commitment to Water Safety by directing resources of their respective organisations towards the development and implementation of the Australian Water Safety Strategy.
The current conveynor of the Council is Rob Bradley, who is also the CEO of the Royal Life Saving Society Australia.

USS Zuiderdijk (ID-2724)

USS "Zuiderdijk" (Id. No. 2724) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
Pre-World War I commercial service and seizure for U.S. Navy.
"Zuiderdijk" was built as the freighter SS "Sharistan" in 1912 by William Gray & Company Ltd. at West Hartlepool, England, in the United Kingdom. Later renamed SS "Zuiderdijk", she was in commercial operation with the Holland-America Line in 1918, when the pressing need of the United States for ships to transport men and material to the front in Europe during World War I forced President Woodrow Wilson to order the seizure of Dutch ships in American ports under international law's right of angary. Customs officials at San Juan, Puerto Rico, took possession of her on 21 March 1918 and turned her over to the U.S. Navy, which placed her in commission as USS "Zuiderdijk" (Id. No. 2724) on 23 March 1918, Lieutenant W. F. Reefer, USNRF, in command.
World War I service.
After preliminary refitting and arming, "Zuiderdijk" departed San Juan on 29 March 1918 and shaped a course for the Panama Canal Zone. She remained at Cristobal, Panama, for nearly a month before getting underway on 25 April 1918 and steaming north. The ship entered New York Harbor on 4 May 1918, unloaded the Panama Railroad Company cargo she had picked up at Cristobal, and replaced it with United States Army supplies destined for Europe.
"Zuiderdijk" departed the United States East Coast in convoy on 17 May 1918 and entered Le Havre, France, on 1 June 1918. After discharging her cargo and taking on ballast, "Zuiderdijk" stood out of Le Havre on 12 June 1918 and headed for the United States. She concluded a 20-day crossing of the Atlantic Ocean when she moored in New York, New York, again on 2 July 1918.
Eleven days of repairs and cargo loading preceded the ship's second departure for France on 13 July 1918. Arriving at Gironde, France, on 28 July 1918, "Zuiderdijk" pulled into St. Nazaire, France, on 29 July 1918. She remained there until mid-August, trading the incoming cargo for one bound for New York. The cargo ship left St. Nazaire on 18 August 1918 and returned to New York on 31 August 1918.
During the ensuing two weeks, "Zuiderdijk" went into drydock for repairs, took on fuel, and loaded cargo for France. On 14 September 1918, the ship stood out of New York on her third and final wartime voyage to Europe. Arriving at Brest, France, on 29 September 1918, she moved to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France, on 30 September 1918 and began discharging her cargo. Upon completion of that operation, "Zuiderdijk" loaded ballast and departed for the United States on 15 October 1918.
Post-World War I service.
"Zuiderdijk" arrived in New York on 28 October 1918. While she was there preparing for the return crossing, the armistice of 11 November 1918 ended hostilities. On the 12 November 1918, she departed New York on the first of two postwar voyages to Europe. The ship reached Quiberon, France, on 25 November 1918, unloaded her burden, and replaced it with a mixed load of 700 tons of rails for ballast and 500 tons of general cargo for return to the United States. She departed the French coast on 6 December 1918 and entered New York harbor on 24 December 1918.
After minor repairs, "Zuiderdijk" moved south to Norfolk, Virginia, where she loaded a cargo belonging to the United States Shipping Board. Late in January 1919, she transported that cargo via the Panama Canal to Guayaquil, Ecuador, loaded a cargo of cocoa and, on 12 February 1919, headed for the Panama Canal once again. On 10 March 1919, the ship arrived at St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, where she received orders to continue immediately on to France. "Zuiderdijk" entered Le Havre, France, on 27 March 1919 and remained there almost a month before heading back to the United States on 24 April 1919.
Arriving in New York on 7 May 1919, "Zuiderdijk" began loading a United States Shipping Board cargo for her last voyage as a ship of the United States Navy. She stood out of New York on 17 June 1919, discharged her cargo at London, England, during the first two weeks of July 1919, and continued on to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. She reached Rotterdam on 17 July 1919. There, on 21 July 1919, "Zuiderdijk" simultaneously was decommissioned, struck from the Navy List, and returned to her former owners.
Return to mercantile service.
"Zuiderdijk" resumed mercantile service, first under the Dutch flag with the Holland-America Line and, after 1923, with T. Law and Company as SS "Misty Law". Her name disappeared from mercantile records in the early 1930s.

Unable to destroy his fellow Autobots Road Handler instead saves the Battle Patrol, but not before the Decepticon successfully create the Air Strike Patrol. (Transformers Marvel U.K. #232-233, "A Small War!")"
The Air Strike Team made their first appearance in issue #56 of the U.S. comic. Working for Megatron (thought to be dead at this point) they made contact with Scorponok's group of Decepticons, placing themselves under his command. They then attacked an airbase, demanding a refueling plane and the fuel to go with it.
When Optimus Prime's Autobots showed up in response in issue #57, Scorponok intervened to protect his "troops". Their work complete, the Air Strike Patrol then left - leaving both Autobots and Decepticons exposed to Megatron's instrument of vengeance - the resurrected and reprogrammed Pretender Starscream.
"They did not appear again in the U.S. storyline, but did get a one-off appearance in the U.K. version of the comic. In a possible future, told in flashback by Rodimus Prime, Scorponok lost a leadership contest with Megatron and Shockwave. Fleeing, Megatron sent the Air Strike Patrol to pursue him, but they wound up in battle with Hot Rod, who Scorponok had surrendered to, forcing the Autobot and his comrades to protect him.

New Silver Beach

New Silver Beach is a beach and village of the same name. It is primarily a summer colony and is the largest settlement at Wild Harbor, a natural bay on the north shore of Buzzards Bay.
It is located on Massachusetts's famous Cape Cod in the census-designated place (CDP) of North Falmouth, in the town of Falmouth, Massachusetts. The area was first settled in 1893 as a seasonal seaside resort for the growing upper middle class of Boston, Massachusetts.
History.
The original planned settlement was first constructed in 1893 as sea bathing was gaining widespread popularity in Europe and the United States. The first street pattern resembled a star with four avenues radiating out from the waterfront intersection of Ocean View Avenue and Moses Road (then called Beach Road). Building proved profitable for developers and by 1898 Joseph Dahlburg and his Silver Beach Water Company had laid out the plans for New Silver Heights, an expansion of development in the area of higher elevation to the west of the original village. At the turn of the 20th century, the Brockton based Silver Beach Land Co. had profitably developed most of the existing plots and New Silver had gained notoriety as a fashionable destination. In the early 20th century, the Silver Beach Hotel was opened at the corner of Arlington Avenue and Wickertree Road. The hotel, though initially successful with the introduction of the automobile, went bankrupt and was subsequently sold and demolished. In the 1920s, numerous fashionable mansions were constructed on the neighboring peninsula of Nyes Neck and although many period homes remain, only two such Gatsby era mansions remain. The village was severely damaged by the great New England Hurricane of 1938 and rebuilding lasted well into the post-war period. During this time, nearby Old Silver Beach became the preeminent destination for the Upper Cape with the construction of the now famous Sea Crest Hotel. Though New Silver lost its regional fame, the economic booms of the 1980s and 1990s led to the rapid creation of new satellite developments enabling the area to maintain its status as a desirable location for holidaymakers.
Yachting.
Yachting has a long and prolific history in the area. New Silver Anchorage was dredged from Wild Harbor in the 1920s to shelter Beetle Cat boats which had become popular among the Cape Cod elite. Prior to the Second World War organized sailing flourished out of Wild Harbor, however U-Boat hysteria during the war led to dwindling popularity. On August 30, 1953, the Wild Harbor Yacht Club was formed on Wickertree Road to primarily serve New Silver and its constituent communities. The Club was incorporated by the United States Sailing Association the following year. A Widgeon fleet was organized in 1979 which brought the sport of sailing back into regional popularity. The club clinched the Southern Massachusetts Beetle Cat championship in 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1989. In 1990 the club focused its junior sailing on the new 420 class racing vessels which were already popular in Europe and Australia. Wild Harbor is a regional powerhouse and dominates the north shore of Buzzards Bay and competes competitively in the Southern Massachusetts Sailing Grand Prix. Wild Harbor has produced three collegiate all-Americans and a member of the 2000 US International 470 team.
Geography.
Wild Harbor.
Wild Harbor is a prominent geographic feature in the area. It is a shallow, natural bay at the mouth of the Wild Harbor River. The bay is formed by two headlands: Nyes Neck peninsula to the north and Crow's Point to the south. The mouth of the bay is oriented to the southwest, the predominant direction of the summer sea breeze giving the harbor unusually rough surf and predictable but strong wind patterns.
Silver Beach.
The beach is located across the northeast shore of Wild Harbor between the estuary of Wild Harbor River and the channel of the New Silver Anchorage. The village center abuts the northern portion of the beach. The centrally located Moses Road runs parallel to the water between the two public access points at the end of Ocean View and Silver Beach Ave. respectively. The beach is protected from erosion by a series of rock jetties. The sandy output from the Wild Harbor river continually builds sandbars across the southern end of the beach which form a vast network of islands at low tide. A deeper sandbar runs about ten yards from the shoreline in an arc parallel to the rest of the beach and can be under between one to two feet of water at low tide. Because the beach is located on a bay opening onto the larger Buzzards Bay, the water is unusually warm for Cape Cod.

Monnett Moni

__NOTOC__
The Monnett Moni is a sport aircraft developed in the United States in the early 1980s and marketed for homebuilding. 
Designed by John Monnett, who coined the term "Air Recreation Vehicle" to describe it, it was a single-seat motorglider with a low, cantilever wing and a V-tail. Construction was of metal throughout, and it was intended to be easy and inexpensive to build and fly. Like many sailplanes, the main undercarriage was a single monowheel, which in this case was mounted in a streamlined fairing beneath the fuselage and was not retractable, with a steerable tailwheel behind it. Builders were also given the option of constructing their example with fixed tricycle undercarriage. Power was provided by a small two-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled engine.
Examples of the Moni are on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum, and the EAA AirVenture Museum.

The Jet Benny Show

The Jet Benny Show is a 1986 science fiction parody film, in which the title character is a spoof of Jack Benny. The plot is a broad parody of the "Star Wars" films, and is deliberately low-budget in appearance.
Synopsis.
Opening.
At the start of the film, we see a black-and-white television show, which appears to be "The Jack Benny Program", although it’s never called this by name. The host (Steve Norman) welcomes his special guest (Polly MacIntyre), and introduces the sketch for the evening (which is the body of the film, and in color).
The “sketch”.
Jet Benny (Norman), a self-proclaimed “intergalactic soldier of fortune,” is traveling through space in his ship — the "Maxwell", piloted by the android Rochester (Kevin Dees) — when the vessel loses power and crashes down on an unfamiliar planet. After Jet regains consciousness, Rochester and the "Maxwell" are nowhere to be found; Jet spends the next few years living in the woods like a hermit.
One day, Jet sees a woman (MacIntyre) being whipped and beaten by a thug and his henchmen, and he uses his raygun to scare them off. The woman turns out to be Princess Miranda; her family and people have been tyrannized by the forces of Lord Zane for the last few years, with the aid of android Rochester whose memory had been damaged by the crash.
After freeing Rochester and restoring his memory, the reluctant Jet is persuaded by Miranda into breaking into Zane's castle and freeing her brother, Prince Carmen (Richard Sabel). After escaping from the castle, the heroes take the "Maxwell" (which was in Zane’s possession) to help Miranda’s father, the King (Mark Walz); he and his people are in a walled city, which is being besieged by Zane’s forces. The heroes win the battle, and the members of the royal family are reunited.
Jet is getting ready to leave the planet when Miranda catches up to him and kisses him; as a result, Jet, who had been eager to get away from the planet, is now reluctant to leave.
Closing.
On the television show, the host thanks the guest and cast members for their work, and starts talking about next week’s show.
Low-budget look.
Unlike the science fiction movies this film parodies, "The Jet Benny Show" was given a deliberate low-budget appearance; “outer space” was a black backdrop with large white lights poking through it, the spaceship had visible wires, action figures were used for a chase scene, et cetera. In one scene, the action was replaced with rotoscoped animation.
Availability.
This movie has been released on VHS videocassette, but not on DVD.

USS Zirkel (ID-3407)

USS "Zirkel" (ID-3407) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
SS "Zirkel" was built in 1918 at Oakland, California, for the United States Shipping Board by the Moore Shipbuilding Company. The U.S. Navy acquired her on 27 September 1918 for World War I service with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, assigned her Identification Number (Id. No.) 3407, and commissioned her the same day as USS "Zirkel" (Id. No. 3407) at San Francisco, California, with Lieutenant Commander David R. Williams, USNRF, in command.
"Zirkel" got underway for the Gulf of Mexico with a cargo of nitrates. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 30 January 1919 and unloaded her cargo.
Following repairs to her turbines, "Zirkel" filled her holds with cotton, coffee, and steel and put to sea on 6 February 1919. After a 21-day voyage, she entered port at Liverpool, England, and began unloading her cargo.
"Zirkel" then took on about 800 tons of iron ore and headed back to the United States on 13 March 1919. On 29 March 1919, the freighter arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and, after unloading, began preparations for demobilization. 
On 3 May 1919, "Zirkel" was decommissioned and was returned to the custody of the United States Shipping Board, once again becoming SS "Zirkel". The Shipping Board retained her until she was scrapped at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1929.

Ronn Reynolds

Ronn Dwayne Reynolds (born September 28, 1958 in Wichita, Kansas) was a Major League Baseball catcher, who played for the New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros and San Diego Padres. After playing college baseball at the University of Arkansas, Reynolds was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 5th round in 1979. After not signing with the Athletics, he was again drafted in the 5th round in 1980, this time by the Mets. Reynolds played 51 games for two of the Mets' class-A minor league teams, getting 29 hits in 149 at bats.
In 1981, Reynolds was promoted to the Mets' class-AA team in Jackson. There he played 88 games, getting 272 at-bats and posting a batting average of .235, a slugging percentage of .309 and an on-base percentage of .314. He repeated at Jackson in 1982, improving to a .255 batting average, a .360 slugging percentage and a .344 on-base percentage in 123 games and 431 at-bats.
His 1982 performance earned him a late season promotion to the Mets. He made his major league debut for the Mets on September 29, 1982 against the Chicago Cubs. In total, he played 2 games for the Mets in 1982, going hitless in 4 at-bats.
In 1983, Reynolds split the season between the Mets and their class-AAA affiliate in Tidewater. He played with the Mets from April 27 through June 13, playing 24 games and getting 66 at-bats. He posted a .197 batting average, a .280 slugging percentage and a .212 on-base percentage. As a catcher, he allowed 27 stolen bases in 38 attempts. The Mets television and radio announcers often commented in the unusual spelling of his first name (with two n's) when he came to bat that season. During his time with Tidewater, he played 40 games, getting 128 at-bats, posting a .211 batting average, a .273 slugging percentage and a .246 on-base percentage.
Reynolds spent the entire 1984 season with Tidewater, posting a batting average of .261, a slugging percentage of .418 and an on-base percentage of .303 in 90 games and 280 at bats. His 11 home runs that season were a career high as a professional. Although he started the 1985 season at Tidewater, playing 3 games there, he was promoted to the Mets early in the season to back up Gary Carter. He played 28 games for the Mets, with a batting average of .209, a slugging percentage of .227 and an on-base percentage of .256 in 43 at-bats. He allowed just 10 stolen bases in 19 attempts. In George Plimpton's 1985 April Fools Day hoax, "The Curious Case of Sidd Finch", Reynolds was mentioned as the catcher who painfully caught Sidd Finch's 168 mph fastball.
After the 1985 season, Reynolds was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Jeff Bittiger in exchange for Rodger Cole and Ronnie Gideon, neither of whom ever played a major league game. He split the 1986 season between the Phillies and their class-AAA minor league affiliate in Portland. He played 43 games for the Phillies, with a batting average of .214 (his Major League high), a slugging percentage of .242 and an on-base percentage of .317 in 126 at-bats. He also hit 3 of his 4 lifetime Major League home runs that season. He allowed 46 stolen bases in 59 attempts.
After the 1986 season, he was traded again to the Houston Astros for Jeff Calhoun. He split the 1987 season between the Astros and their class-AAA minor league affiliate in Tucson. He played 38 games for the Astros, with a batting average of .167, a slugging percentage of .189 and an on-base percentage of .235 in 102 at-bats. He allowed 46 stolen bases in 59 attempts. On October 1, Reynolds was the victim of a rare triple-steal versus the Atlanta Braves. With the bases loaded, Reynolds made a return throw to pitcher Danny Darwin and the Braves' Gerald Perry broke from third towards home plate. Darwin threw back to Reynolds but Reynolds dropped the ball and all three runners were safe. Not only were the Braves credited with three stolen bases but Reynolds was injured on the play and left the game.
He was released by the Astros after the 1987 season and signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers. He never played a game for the Brewers, spending the 1988 and 1989 seasons playing for the Brewers' class AAA affiliate in Denver. His 1989 season was shortened by a pre-season Achilles tendon rupture. He was granted free agency after the 1989 season and signed with the San Diego Padres. He played most of the 1990 season with the Padres class-AAA affiliate in Las Vegas. He did play 8 games for the Padres, getting just one hit (a double) in 15 at-bats. He played his last major league game for the Padres on July 5, 1990.
In all, Reynolds played 143 Major League games in 6 seasons, getting 356 at-bats, 4 home runs, a career batting average of .188, a career slugging percentage of .228 and a career on-base percentage of .256. His minor league totals were 701 games, 2193 at-bats, 49 home runs, a .238 batting average, a .358 slugging percentage and a .309 on-base percentage.

Envelope system

The envelope system, also known as the envelope method, is a popular method for visualizing and maintaining a budget. The key idea is to store the cash to meet separate categories of household expenses in physically separate envelopes.
Usage.
Typically, the person will write the name and average cost per month of a bill on the front of an envelope. Then, either once a month or when the person gets paid, he or she will put the amount for that bill in cash on the envelope. When the bill is due, the money is taken out to pay for that bill.
This prevents the person from spending the money out of their pocket or bank account, because it is already allocated to the bill.
This is a budgeting mechanism often suggested to people by Dave Ramsey.

Marine-Regatta-Verein

The Marine-Regatta-Verein (MRV), "Naval Regatta Union", is a yacht club of the German Navy. Its main branch is located in the harbor city of Kiel, and it has branches in different states of Germany. This club promotes both sailing and powerboating. Many of its members also are engaged in yacht racing and yacht cruising around the world.
Although it began as a yacht club for navy officers, it presently opens its doors to everyone with an interest in sailing and in the historical memory of both the German Navy and the merchant navy.
History.
This club was founded in February 1887 in Kiel by Vice Admiral von Blanc and Navy Engineer Busley along with other 112 officers of the Imperial German Navy. It was established as the "Marine-Regatta-Verein" (Regatta Union of the Navy), an association exclusively for military personnel in order "to foster the joy of sailing". Prince Heinrich of Prussia, a yachting enthusiast, was the patron of the club. The newly-born club organized its first successful regatta already in the same year in June.
In 1891 the 500 naval officers that ran the club elected Emperor Wilhelm II as their commodore. The club's name was altered to "Kaiserlicher Yacht Club" (Imperial Yacht Club). The new statutes allowed civilian members in, so the nature and the purpose of the club changed radically.
In August 1928, most of the active naval officers left the Kaiserlicher Yachtclub and revived the Marine-Regatta-Verein, as an organization attached to the German navy, which became the Kriegsmarine during Nazi times.
The Marine-Regatta-Verein took part in the organization of regattas in the Bay of Kiel, like the Kiel Week and the sailing events of Hitler's 1936 Summer Olympics. As a result the club went through a period of expansion, reaching a record number of 3,600 member, becoming the largest sailing club in Europe.
In 1945, at the end of World War II, the Marine-Regatta-Verein was disbanded by the allied forces in Kiel.
In May 1972 the Marine-Regatta-Verein was refounded in an effort led by Friedrich Rohlfing, who would become its president. The revived club was officially registered under the name "Marine-Regatta-Verein im Deutschen Marinebund e.V. (MRV im DMB e.V.)". It is under the "Verein Deutscher Marinebund" (German Navy Association) and it has its seat in Kiel.

The Hill Radnor is a breed of domestic sheep originating in the United Kingdom. Classified as one of the mountain (or upland) breeds, it is most common from Powys down to southwest Herefordshire and Monmouthshire. The Hill Radnor has a dense white fleece, with a light brown face and legs. Ewes are polled and rams are horned. It is hardy and forages well, like many hill breeds. Hill Radnor ewes have good maternal instincts, and are sometimes crossed with lowland rams to yield market lambs or mules. Lambing percentages vary under different conditions but the breed can easily average around 155%. The breed is listed as "vulnerable" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the U.K.

Dattatreya Aralikatte

Dattatreya Aralikatte, known in Karnataka as Datta (born February 22, 1953) is an Indian puppeteer and teacher, born in Aralikatte village, in the Chikkamagaluru district of Karnataka, India, and resides in Bangalore, India. He heads the "Putthali Kalaranga" (Puppet Theater), a well known traditional puppet theater group in India.
Early life.
Datta grew up in Aralikatte and graduated from high school from Basarikatte school. He is born to a Gandhi following father, M.S. Ramarao and Lalithamma. He earned his Bachelors of Arts and in Bachelors of Education Degrees from the Mysore University and Master of Arts and Master of Education from the Bangalore University. Being a student, he was very much interested in the field of theater.
His first endeavour with theatre was during his college days and then on, theater has been an indispensable part of his life. He worked with playwrights and senior theater persons like Parvatha Vani and Dr. B.S. Narayana Rao both in Kannada and Sanskrit languages. As he excelled in the field of theater, he got inspired to write his own plays, keeping in mind, the current social problems, amalgamated with inclusion of Mythological characters in his plays. He has highlighted problems such as pollution, deforestation, and adulteration in his plays.
He is married to Ramamani Dattatreya, who assists him with his theater and has two sons, Karthik Datta and Manohar Datta who live in Houston, Texas. They assist their father in his puppetry talks occasionally.
Plays.
The theater has efficiently adopted plays like Sri Krishna Thulabhara, Lankadahana, Kumara Sambhava, Sri Krishna Digvijaya. The plays convey the myths and realities of life, thus supporting a moral in each play adorned with classical music along with Yakshagana beats, making it a complete show.
Datta, as a part of his educational plans for his students, has taken many chapters in textbooks; to name a few, Panchatantra, Buddha's Life. 
Synopsis.
The troupe is famous for its Kumara Sambhava (Birth of Lord Kumara) shows. The story: during the mythological churning of the ocean, the celestial nectar that was produced was rightfully handed over to the Devas (The Gods) and they became immortal after consuming it. The Rakshasas (The Demons) too felt the need to become immortal and one amongst them was Tarakasura. He performed severe penance to propitiate Lord Brahma and ask him to grant immortality. But lord Brahma granted him invincibility instead, with the exception of defeat from Lord Shiva’s son Kumara.
Tarakasura knew about the demise of Dakshayani the erstwhile consort of Lord Shiva at her father Daksha’s Yagna and he also knew that Lord Shiva himself was in deep penance in the Himalayas. That Lord Shiva would again get married immediately and a son begot did not seem probable to Tarakasura and hence the prospect of his impending death at the hands of Kumara (Shiva’s son) did not frighten him. After receiving the boon of invincibility, Taraka became a tyrant causing trouble to one and all.
The Devas who had to bear the brunt of the newly acquired prowess of Taraka turned to Lord Vishnu for advice and protection. Lord Vishnu summoned Manmatha, and entrusted him with the dangerous task of breaking Lord Shiva’s penance and make him fall in love with Parvathi who was in the vicinity undertaking a severe penance to win over Lord Shiva. Manmatha arrived on the location and performed his task which eventually led him being reduced to ashes, when lord Shiva opened his third eye.
Lord Shiva after testing Parvathi’s love and devotion towards him in a few subtle ways married her. The birth of Kumara ensued and this led to the slaying of Tarakasura ending his tyranny.
Guru.
He learned practical puppetry under his Guru M.R. Ranganatha Rao, a Central Sangeet Natak Akademi Award Winner. He understood the philosophical meaning under Sriranga Mahaguru, the founder of the “AshtangaYoga Vijnana Mandiram” a spiritual Centre and Sri Sri RangaPriya Swamiji. As a result he established his own puppet theater called “Putthali Kalaranga”, evolving a new style in the field of Puppet Theater called “Mudrika Style”.

Other awards include
Karnataka State Janapada Yakshagana Award,
DSERT State Award,
Excellence in Education Award,
Aryabhata award and
Raghasuddhalaya Puraskar.
Philosophy.
Mudrika Style: Datta's Puppet shows are temple-based and of Mudrika Style. Mudrika means "Mudra" or impression of God, Culture and Tradition. Mudra aims at preserving for the future generation, the philosophy of life, the philosophy of culture and tradition. Mudra symbolizes Union of God and the Soul. This Philosophy is stressed in Mudrika style puppet theatre.
Natya Shastra is an ancient script which deals with Indian Dance and Drama. "Abhinaya" (acting, expression and movement) is important here. Vaachikabhinaya (facial expression), Aangikabhinaya (body expression) together constitute Abhinaya. This aspect receives more importance in Mudrika style puppet theatre and leaves a lasting impression on the minds and the hearts of the audience. The costume design for the puppets is done keeping in view the essential features ancient culture. Hence classical Indian dance, music and literature are an integral part of Mudrika School. The songs are based on Karnatic Classical tunes.
Putthali: Putthali in Sanskrit means the Puppet used for the performance. Manipulation of an intricate web of strings, enables the movement of the puppet.
Sutradhara: The protagonist of the show introduces the story and the characters to the audience and also performs rituals before and after the show. Some times, he narrates the story. The concept of “Sutradhara” is a gift given by the Puppet Theatre to the Indian Theatre..”

Mobile phone

A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone, and a hand phone) is a device that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link while moving around a wide geographic area. It does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, allowing access to the public telephone network. By contrast, a cordless telephone is used only within the short range of a single, private base station.
In addition to telephony, modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other services such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming and photography. Mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.
The first hand-held cell phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Dr Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973, using a handset weighing around 2.2 pounds (1 kg).
In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first to be commercially available. From 1990 to 2011, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew from 12.4 million to over 6 billion, penetrating about 87% of the global population and reaching the bottom of the economic pyramid.
History.
A hand-held mobile radiotelephone is an old dream of radio engineering. A particularly vivid and in many ways accurate prediction was presented by Arthur C. Clarke in a 1959 essay, where he envisioned a "personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one." He wrote: "the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialing a number." Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so that "no one need ever again be lost." Later, in "Profiles of the Future", he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980's.
Early predecessors of cellular phones included analog radio communications from ships and trains. The race to create truly portable telephone devices began after World War II, with developments taking place in many countries. The advances in mobile telephony have been traced in successive "generations" from the early "0G" (zeroth generation) services like the Bell System's Mobile Telephone Service and its successor, Improved Mobile Telephone Service. These "0G" systems were not cellular, supported few simultaneous calls, and were very expensive.
The first handheld mobile cell phone was demonstrated by Motorola in 1973. The first commercial automated cellular network was launched in Japan by NTT in 1979. In 1981, this was followed by the simultaneous launch of the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Several other countries then followed in the early to mid-1980s. These first generatiion ("1G") systems could support far more simultaneous calls, but still used analog technology.
In 1991, the second generation (2G) "digital" cellular technology was launched in Finland by Radiolinja on the GSM standard, which sparked competition in the sector, as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G network operators.
Ten years later, in 2001, the third generation (3G) was launched in Japan by NTT DoCoMo on the WCDMA standard. This was followed by 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G enhancements based on the high-speed packet access (HSPA) family, allowing UMTS networks to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity.
By 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications like streaming media. Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized 4th-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to 10-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as 4G were the WiMAX standard (offered in the U.S. by Sprint) and the LTE standard, first offered in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera.
Features.
All mobile phones have a number of features in common, but manufacturers also try to differentiate their own products by implementing additional functions to make them more attractive to consumers. This has led to great innovation in mobile phone development over the past 20 years.
The common components found on all phones are:
Low-end mobile phones are often referred to as feature phones, and offer basic telephony. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications became known as smartphones.
Several phone series have been introduced to address a given market segment, such as the RIM BlackBerry focusing on enterprise/corporate customer email needs; the Sony-Ericsson 'Walkman' series of music/phones and 'Cybershot' series of camera/phones; the Nokia Nseries of multimedia phones, the Palm Pre the HTC Dream and the Apple iPhone.
Text messaging.
The most commonly used data application on mobile phones is SMS text messaging. The first SMS text message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK, while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993.
The first mobile news service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000, and subsequently many organizations provided "on-demand" and "instant" news services by SMS.
SIM card.
GSM feature phones require a small microchip called a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM Card, to function. The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the service-subscriber key (IMSI) and the Ki used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone. The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device.
The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker Giesecke & Devrient for the Finnish wireless network operator Radiolinja. 
Multi-card hybrid phones.
A hybrid mobile phone can hold up to four SIM cards. SIM and RUIM cards may be mixed together to allow both GSM and CDMA networks to be accessed.
From 2010 onwards they became popular in India and Indonesia and other emerging markets, attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest on-net calling rate. In Q3 2011, Nokia shipped 18 million of its low cost dual SIM phone range in an attempt to make up lost ground in the higher end smartphone market.
Kosher phones.
There are Jewish orthodox religious restrictions which standard mobile telephones do not meet. To fulfill this demand, phones without Internet access, text messaging or cameras are required. These restricted phones are known as kosher phones and have rabbinical approval for use in Israel and elsewhere by observant Orthodox Jews. Some are even approved for use by essential workers (such as health, security and public services) on the sabbath, even though use of any electrical device is restricted.
Although these phones are intended to prevent immodesty, some vendors report good sales to adults who prefer the simplicity of the devices.
Mobile phone operators.
The world's largest individual mobile operator by subscribers is China Mobile with over 500 million mobile phone subscribers. Over 50 mobile operators have over 10 million subscribers each, and over 150 mobile operators had at least one million subscribers by the end of 2009. In February 2010, there were 6 billion mobile phone subscribers, a number that is expected to grow.
Manufacturers.
Prior to 2010, Nokia was the market leader. However, since then competition emerged in the Asia Pacific region with brands such as Micromax, Nexian, and i-Mobile and chipped away at Nokia's market share. Android powered smartphones also gained momentum across the region at the expense of Nokia. In India, their market share also dropped significantly to around 31 percent from 56 percent in the same period. Their share was displaced by Chinese and Indian vendors of low-end mobile phones.
In Q1 2012, based on Strategy Analytics, Samsung surpassed Nokia, selling 93.5 million units and 82.7 million units, respectively. Standard & Poor's has also downgraded Nokia to 'junk' status at BB+/B with negative outlook due to high loss and still declined with growth of Lumia smartphones was not sufficient to offset a rapid decline in revenue from Symbian-based smartphones over the next few quarters.
Other manufacturers outside the top five include TCL Communication, Lenovo, Sony Mobile Communications, Motorola. Smaller current and past players include Karbonn Mobile, Audiovox (now UTStarcom), BenQ-Siemens, BlackBerry, Casio, CECT, Coolpad, Fujitsu, HTC, Just5, Kyocera, Lumigon, Micromax Mobile, Mitsubishi Electric, Modu, NEC, Neonode, Openmoko, Panasonic, Palm, Pantech Wireless Inc., Philips, Qualcomm Inc., Sagem, Sanyo, Sharp, Sierra Wireless, SK Teletech, Soutec, Trium, Toshiba, and Vidalco.
Use of mobile phones.
In general.
Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes, including keeping in touch with family members, conducting business, and having access to a telephone in the event of an emergency. Some people carry more than one cell phone for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Multiple SIM cards may also be used to take advantage of the benefits of different calling plans—a particular plan might provide cheaper local calls, long-distance calls, international calls, or roaming. The mobile phone has also been used in a variety of diverse contexts in society, for example:
For distributing content.
In 1998, one of the first examples of distributing and selling media content through the mobile phone was the sale of ringtones by Radiolinja in Finland. Soon afterwards, other media content appeared such as news, video games, jokes, horoscopes, TV content and advertising. Most early content for mobile tended to be copies of legacy media, such as the banner advertisement or the TV news highlight video clip. Recently, unique content for mobile has been emerging, from the ringing tones and ringback tones in music to "mobisodes", video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones.
In 2006, the total value of mobile-phone-paid media content exceeded Internet-paid media content and was worth 31 billion dollars. The value of music on phones was worth 9.3 billion dollars in 2007 and gaming was worth over 5 billion dollars in 2007.
While driving.
Mobile phone use while driving is common but controversial. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents. Because of this, many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore ban both handheld and hands-free use of a mobile phone; others —including the UK, France, and many U.S. states—ban handheld phone use only, allowing hands-free use.
Due to the increasing complexity of mobile phones, they are often more like mobile computers in their available uses. This has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials in distinguishing one usage from another as drivers use their devices. This is more apparent in those countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those who have banned handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally on a phone call when, in fact, they were using the device for a legal purpose such as the phone's incorporated controls for car stereo or satnav.
A recently published study has reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while cycling and its effects on behaviour and safety.
Mobile banking and payments.
In many countries, mobile phones are used to provide mobile banking services, which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message. Kenya's M-PESA mobile banking service, for example, allows customers of the mobile phone operator Safaricom to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards. Cash may be deposited or withdrawn from M-PESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country, and may be transferred electronically from person to person as well as used to pay bills to companies.
Branchless banking has also been successful in South Africa and Philippines. A pilot project in Bali was launched in 2011 by the International Finance Corporation and an Indonesian bank Bank Mandiri.
Another application of mobile banking technology is Zidisha, a US-based nonprofit microlending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from web users worldwide. Zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments, transferring funds from lenders in the United States to the borrowers in rural Africa using the internet and mobile phones.
Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999 the Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payments systems, on the mobile operators Globe and Smart.
Some mobile phone can make mobile payments via direct mobile billing schemes or through contactless payments if the phone and point of sale support near field communication (NFC). This requires the co-operation of manufacturers, network operators and retail merchants to enable contactless payments through NFC-equipped mobile phones.
Tracking and privacy.
Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. While the phone is turned on, the geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known as multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone.
The movements of a mobile phone user can be tracked by their service provider and, if desired, by law enforcement agencies and their government. Both the SIM card and the handset can be tracked.
China has proposed using this technology to track commuting patterns of Beijing city residents. In the UK and US, law enforcement and intelligence services use mobiles to perform surveillance. They possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely in order to listen to conversations that take place near the phone.
Thefts.
According to the Federal Communications Commission, one out of three robberies involved the theft of a cellular phone. Police data in San Francisco showed that one-half of all robberies in 2012 were thefts of cellular phones. An online petition on Change.org called "Secure our Smartphones" urged smartphone manufacturers to install kill switches in their devices to make them unusable in case of theft. The petition is part of a joint effort by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon and was directed to the CEOs of the major smartphone manufacturers and telecommunication carriers. 
On Monday, 10 June 2013, Apple announced it would install a kill switch on its next iPhone operating system, due to debut in October 2013.
Health effects.
The effect mobile phone radiation has on human health is the subject of recent interest and study, as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world. Mobile phones use electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range, which some believe may be harmful to human health. A large body of research exists, both epidemiological and experimental, in non-human animals and in humans, of which the majority shows no definite causative relationship between exposure to mobile phones and harmful biological effects in humans. This is often paraphrased simply as the balance of evidence showing no harm to humans from mobile phones, although a significant number of individual studies do suggest such a relationship, or are inconclusive. Other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.
On 31 May 2011, the World Health Organization stated that mobile phone use may possibly represent a long-term health risk, classifying mobile phone radiation as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" after a team of scientists reviewed studies on cell phone safety. Mobile phones are in category 2B, which ranks it alongside coffee and other possibly carcinogenic substances.
At least some recent studies have found an association between cell phone use and certain kinds of brain and salivary gland tumors. Lennart Hardell and other authors of a 2009 meta-analysis of 11 studies from peer-reviewed journals concluded that cell phone usage for at least ten years "approximately doubles the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumor on the same ('ipsilateral') side of the head as that preferred for cell phone use."
One study of past cell phone use cited in the report showed a "40% increased risk for gliomas (brain cancer) in the highest category of heavy users (reported average: 30 minutes per day over a 10‐year period)." This is a reversal from their prior position that cancer was unlikely to be caused by cellular phones or their base stations and that reviews had found no convincing evidence for other health effects. Certain countries, including France, have warned against the use of cell phones especially by minors due to health risk uncertainties. However, a study published 24 March 2012 in the "British Medical Journal" questioned these estimates, because the increase in brain cancers has not paralleled the increase in mobile phone use.
Future evolution.
5G is a technology used in research papers and projects to denote the next major phase of mobile telecommunication standards beyond the 4G/IMT-Advanced standards. 5G is not officially used for any specification or official document yet made public by telecommunication companies or standardization bodies such as 3GPP, WiMAX Forum, or ITU-R. New standard releases beyond 4G are in progress by standardization bodies, but are at this time not considered as new mobile generations but under the 4G umbrella.
Deloitte is predicting a collapse in wireless performance to come as soon as 2016, as more devices using more and more services compete for limited bandwidth.
Environmental impact.
Studies have shown that around 40-50% of the environmental impact of a mobile phone occurs during the manufacturing of the printed wiring boards and integrated circuits. The average user replaces their mobile phone every 11 to 18 months. The discarded phones then contribute to electronic waste.
Mobile phone manufacturers within Europe are subject to the WEEE directive. Australia introduced a mobile phone recycling scheme.
Conflict minerals.
Demand for metals found in mobile phones is fuelling the Congo Civil War. The war claimed almost 5.5 million lives. In a 2012 news story, "The Guardian" reported, "In unsafe mines deep underground in eastern Congo, children are working to extract minerals essential for the electronics industry. The profits from the minerals finance the bloodiest conflict since the second world war; the war has lasted nearly 20 years and has recently flared up again. ... For the last 15 years, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been a major source of natural resources for the mobile phone industry." 
FairPhone is an attempt to develop a mobile phone which does not contain conflict minerals.

Kaiserlicher Yacht Club

Kaiserlicher Yacht-Club, "Imperial Yacht Club", was one of the forerunners of the Kiel Yacht Club. Known also as "Küz" from its acronym KYC, it was a prestigious yacht club located in the harbor city of Kiel, Germany. German Emperor Wilhelm II, his younger brother Prince Heinrich of Prussia and Alfred Krupp were among its members. This club was famous for the sailing events it organized, including its role in the first Kieler Woche regattas, an event that still takes place yearly in the Kiel Bay.
History.
The origins of this club are in the "Marine-Regatta-Verein" (Regatta Union of the Navy), a club for naval officers of the Kaiserliche Marine founded in Kiel in 1887. The Marine-Regatta-Verein was specialized in yacht racing and Prince Heinrich of Prussia, a yachting enthusiast, was its patron. In 1891 the club allowed civilians in and Emperor Wilhelm II became its commodore, bringing his own yacht "Meteor I" (the former "Thistle") to the club's marina in Kiel. The same year the club changed its name to "Kaiserlicher Yacht Club".
The club's youth section was founded in 1910. At the time of World War I the club house was transformed into a Lazaretto and 455 members of the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club died in the war. After these difficult years the club almost went bankrupt and it barely managed to survive.
The Kaiserlicher Yacht Club retained its name even after the Treaty of Versailles that brought the German monarchy to an end. William II remained as honorary commodore of the club, while he lived in exile in Doorn, the Netherlands. 
During Nazi rule the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club, like all German sports organizations, was manipulated by the Nazi Sports Office. Even though it took part in the organization of the sailing events of Hitler's 1936 Summer Olympics in the Bay of Kiel, the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club gradually lost its freedom. 
In 1937 the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club was forcibly merged with other yacht clubs and the commodore's title was withdrawn from exiled and ailing former Emperor William. A new massive entity, the "Yacht-Club von Deutschland" (YCvD), "Yacht Club of Germany", was formed to "instill unity among German youth" by introducing Nazi-ideology in the way the club was ruled. The club's name "Kaiserlicher Yacht Club", deemed by the Nazis not to be in tune with "the spirit of the times", passed into oblivion. 
A contemporary avatar of this club was founded under the name Yacht Club of Kiel in 1948. The "Marine-Regatta-Verein" was refounded in 1972 as a separate club.

ELTO

The Elto Outdoor Motor Company (Elto) was the second major outboard motor business founded by Ole Evinrude. Elto outboard engines were produced in the U.S. from 1921 to 1941. 
History.
Ole sold his half of the original Evinrude Motor Company to his partner Chris Meyer in 1913 with the condition that Evinrude stay out of the outboard motor business for five years. 
Ole Evinrude continued designing motors during this time and developed a new engine that made extensive use of lightweight aluminum. His new twin cylinder design weighed one third less than the Evinrude Motor Co.'s best selling (single cylinder) model and produced 50% more power.
Five years later, in 1920 Ole and his wife Bess decided to re-enter the outboard business with their new design, but still could not use the "Evinrude" name. Instead, they called their new Milwaukee venture the Elto Outdoor Motor Co. ELTO was Bess's effort to create a distinctive, one-word brand name like "Kodak." It derived from the first letters of "Evinrude Light Twin Outboard."
By 1925, Elto's sales topped those of previous industry leader Evinrude Motor Co.
In 1928 the ELTO company introduced America's first four cylinder two-cycle outboard motor, the Super Elto Quad, which was capable of speeds over 35 mph. Though still outsold by Johnson, Elto was the industry's most profitable company that year. 
Meanwhile, the Evinrude Motor Co. floundered, and in 1929, Stephen Foster Briggs, co-founder of its new owner, Briggs & Stratton Corporation; proposed a merger between the Evinrude Motor Co., the Elto Outdoor Motor Co., and the Lockwood Motor Co. of Jackson, Michigan. Eager to regain his namesake company, Evinrude agreed to the deal and became president of the new Outboard Motors Corporation (OMC), headquartered in Milwaukee.
Initially, each of the three companies marketed a complete line of motors, but as the Great Depression eroded sales, a new strategy was called for. "Evinrude" became the premium brand, while "Elto" was positioned as the company's economy line. This streamlining helped the company survive the worst years of the Depression, but with the acquisition of the Johnson Motors Co. in 1935 - one year after Ole Evinrude's death - Elto became something of an orphan within the OMC family.
The 1.1-hp Evinrude Scout, later renamed the Ranger, was introduced in 1938. The ½-hp Evinrude Mate came along less than a year later with a retail price of $34.50. 
Elto countered in 1938 with the 1.1-hp Pal, selling for $37.50 and the Elto Cub in 1939. 
World War II ended production of civilian models, and the prosperous post-war economy demanded larger, faster, more feature-laden motors. OMC neglected to resume the brand immediately after the war, but did make a brief reintroduction of the name in 1949 based on a pair of economy engines made by OMC's Gale Products. 
Products.
ELTO outboards were made in a variety of sizes from the Cub, Pal and Ace, to the Ruddertwin and Lightwin. 
Elto Cub 0.5 HP - 8 lbs
Elto Pal 0.9 HP - 1.1 HP
Elto Ace 1.4 to 1.8 HP
Produced for only two years, the Elto Cub is an interesting sidelight to the venerable history of the outboard motor industry. Weighing only 8.5 pounds, this .5 horsepower motor was advertised as the "world's lightest outboard" when introduced in 1939. 
The Elto Cub filled a small niche in the outboard market of the late 1930s. Its price of $29.50 appealed to Depression-stretched pocketbooks. The Cub was suitable only for the lightest duty use because of its light weight.

Richlands railway station

Richlands is a railway station in the suburb of Richlands on the Springfield line of the Queensland Rail Citytrain network. The rail extension to Richlands is the first step in the progressive construction of the Springfield line to Springfield.
The station multi-storey car park has 650 car parking spaces for vehicles. According to local councillor David Morrison, these are filled as early as 8:30 AM.
Construction and opening.
Construction started on the station on with a cost of $40 million. The planning included about 650 car parks, a bus interchange, bicycle lockers and a drop-off area. The station is expected to be completed by 2011, alongside the first stage of the Springfield line.
The station was due to open to the public on with no services due to scheduled maintenance works on the Ipswich line, but due to the Queensland floods the opening was brought forward to in order to assist with the recovery efforts.

Goal Line Blitz

Goal Line Blitz is a browser-based, American football massive multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG). Goal Line Blitz was created by Peter and Jesse, known in-game as Bort and DigitalDaggers, respectively.
Goal Line Blitz allows users to open a free account and become the agent for players that they create. When creating players, the agents are able to customize those players by choosing their first and last names, positions, physical attributes and player types. After players have been created, the agent is then able to add equipment, accept contract offers for their players, direct their player's training, and increase player's abilities by adding skill points. Agents are also able to own teams and/or serve as managers, coordinators, scouts or recruiters for teams owned by others.
Registration process.
User registration requires a chosen username, valid email address and password. Up to three different people can create their own accounts from the same IP address but one person running multiple accounts is not allowed.
Flex Points.
Flex Points (FP) are used to buy teams, schedule games against other teams, create players, elevate the level of players (boosting), and purchase custom equipment. Users are given 400 free Flex Points with registration, and may purchase more at any time. Flex Points are sold in packages at a rate of $US1 per 100 Flex Points, although an increasing discount rate is applied as the purchase size increases. Creating a player, or boosting a player one level, costs between 100 and 300 Flex Points depending on position (the cost of a 1 level boost is the same as the original cost of creating the player). Agents receive a refund of Flex Points when they decide to have their player(s) retire. Retirement yields a 100% of the Flex Points used to create a player, plus 70% of the FP used to increase a player's level (boost), and 70% of the FP used to purchase custom equipment.
Reward Points.
Reward Points are a secondary type of currency used in Goal Line Blitz. These are like flex points, but are non-refundable upon the retirement of players. They cannot be used to purchase teams, or to extend team ownership, but team owners may use these to schedule scrimmage (or “friendly”) games. On occasion, free “Reward Points are distributed to each active user. This normally happens during holidays, special occasions, or at the end of a season. Reward points are typically only given to active accounts.
Players.
Most users begin by creating their own virtual players, represented by customizable avatars. Players can specialize in one of sixteen American football positions, such as quarterback or linebacker. Once created, a user (represented in-game as an "agent") can sign their virtual football player to a team, buy/create/improve the player's equipment, set the player's skill/attribute training, and adjust the player's tactics for a game.
Each player has several basic physical attributes (such as speed and strength) and football skills (such as tackling and catching), as well as special ability trees unique to their positions, that they can choose to develop.
Players earn experience points through playing time and training. Once a player has gained enough experience points, he will gain a level. Each level gives the player more Skill Points to assign to his attributes and abilities. A player's level can also be increased by "Boosting" with Flex Points, up to three levels, per player, per season.
Players receive Training Points each day, which can be used to progress training percentage bars for each attribute; when a bar reaches 100% the selected attribute will go up by 1 full point. Daily training can be “Intense”, “Normal” or “Light”, depending on the wishes of the agent. The higher the training intensity, the more progress a player's training bar will make. However, there are more “Bonus Tokens” awarded for lighter training. These bonus tokens can then be used for various things, such as purchasing equipment, upgrading a player's training, adding special abilities, etc.
There are also 'free players' you can make. These players require no flex points to make, and the player gets 3 free boosts every season. However, the player must be in high demand.
Team owner.
Owners manage several aspects of a team. They set ticket and concession prices, improve and construct the team's stadium, build the roster, and set game-to-game tactics, with the ultimate goal of winning a league championship. An owner can also appoint other users as General Managers and grant them certain abilities, normally reserved for the team owner, in order to assist with the running and maintenance of the team. Among these are the ability to set the team's depth chart, change tactics, offer contracts to players, make trades, etc.
The ownership experience is very in-depth and there are even different levels available depending on how deep an owner wants to go. The Casual Leagues allow for owners to have some control but do not require as much planning or strategy as the Full Leagues which allow owners to control almost every aspect of their team both on and off the field. This tiered level of ownership allows for people of all ability levels to enjoy the game on their own terms.

Leucoagaricus leucothites

Leucoagaricus leucothites, or white Agaricus mushroom, is a fairly uncommon parasol mushroom. It looks more like a normal but almost pure white commercial mushroom albeit more slender and with a longer stalk. It is distinguished by a smooth, white cap with a gently yellow center, a collar-like ring, white spores, and off-white gills in maturity. Immature specimens have pure white gills. This is a choice edible, but care must be made to distinguish this from other members of the "Lepiota" tribe and also the far more deadly members of the "Amanita" tribe. The deadly white Amanitas have a volva (a sack like appendage surrounding the base of the stem) totally lacking in this species. This is not a mushroom recommended for consumption by those without good knowledge of fungi. This species is slowly extending its range northward, possibly as a result of global warming, and is locally common in Devon especially in Torbay (due to the exceptionally mild micro-climate), and other parts of south-west England. The species was originally described as "Agaricus leucothites" by Carlo Vittadini in 1835.

Vasomotor center

The vasomotor center (VMC) is a portion of the medulla oblongata that regulates blood pressure and other homeostatic processes. Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors, it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels. This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation, especially in the brain. Cranial nerves IX (Glossopharyngeal nerve) and X Vagus nerve both feed into the vasomotor centre and are themselves involved in the regulation of blood pressure.

Cotyledon tomentosa (Bear's Paw) is a species of the "Cotyledon" genus. Cotyledon tomentosa, native to Africa, has large chunky ovate fuzzy green leaves with prominent "teeth" at tips that give the impression of bear's paws. It forms large orange bell-shaped flowers in spring. In habitat in Africa, Cotyledons usually grow in rocky quartz fields where they have excellent drainage provided by very porous soil. They thrive with bright light and ample airflow. Water thoroughly when soil is dry to the touch. Water with caution in winter, as the plant can lose its roots if the soil stays cold and wet for extended periods. They are dormant in summer. Protect from frost to prevent scarring.

It then states that the signee believes the eleven Salvation Army Doctrines. It follows this with a list of promises that the Soldier is to adhere to, including the promises that they will: 
The Articles conclude with a call for the Soldier to sign the document with a declaration that they "do here declare my full determination, by God’s help, to be a true soldier of The Salvation Army." 
Chosen To Be A Soldier.
Those that become Soldiers of the Salvation Army adhere to the rules and regulations of the Salvation Army, listed in "Chosen To Be A Soldier: Orders and Regulations for Soldiers of the Salvation Army". These orders and regulations together make up a manual of operations for furthering the mission on which Salvationists are engaged.
As conditions, challenges and opportunities change, orders and regulations are reviewed and amended. A recent notable trend has been towards giving territories greater discretion in applying or adapting regulations to fit their particular circumstances.

August Kappler

August Kappler (November 11, 1815 - October 20, 1887) was a German researcher, naturalist and explorer who was a native of Mannheim. He is credited as the founder of Albina, Suriname.
From January 1836, Kappler was stationed in Suriname as a soldier and member of the Dutch colonial service. Here he had the opportunity to explore the country, and in the process, amass a large collection of insects and plants. In 1854 he published a book involving his experiences in the Dutch colony during time spent as a member of the colonial service. 
After his military duties were finished, he spent the years 1842 to 1846 based in Paramaribo, from where he sold butterflies that were collected locally. In latter part of 1846, he had earned enough money to purchase a plot of land near the Marowijne River. Here he would spent the next 33 years of his life, working as a trader, farmer, postal official, et al. He called his homestead "Albina", after his fiancé Albina Josefine Liezenmaier. Within the decade, Albina would become a small settlement with a handful of European settlers.
In 1879 Kappler left Suriname and returned to Germany, subsequently publishing two more books on his experiences in the Dutch colony. He died in Stuttgart at the age of 71, and at his funeral, his coffin was covered with the flag of the Netherlands.

Massenet Festival

Massenet Festival (or "Festival Massenet" in French) is a biennale festival of music by French composer, Jules Massenet held in Saint-Étienne, France, close to the area where the composer was born. The first Massenet Festival took place in November 1990 when the opera "Cléopâtre" and the oratorio "La Vierge" were presented. In recent years, performances have been given in the Grand Théâtre Massenet, one of the theatres of the Opéra Théâtre de Saint-Etienne, and formerly known as L'Esplanade.
History.
Following the initial success of staging Massenet's "Amadis" in 1988 during an "unofficial" festival of his work, the organizers decided to regularly fund these festivals starting in 1990. However, because the L' Esplanade opera house in Saint-Étienne burned down in October 1998, the originally planned next festival was delayed for more than half a year.
Thus initial founders of the Festival were Jean-Louis Pichon (director and principal producer) and Patrick Fournillier (musical director and conductor).
Later Festival highlights.
In 1992, "Esclarmonde" was staged (with the participation of Denia Mazzola Gavazzeni in the title role), while the Third Massenet Festival in 1994 brought revivals of such operas as "Grisélidis", "Panurge", and "Le Cid".
Over the following years, the other Massenet operas have been presented:
Recordings.
So far, only those festival performances before 1995 have been released on audio CD (under the label Koch-Schwann) and are available to the public.

Alfredo was born in Cuba. When he was eleven years old he immigrated with his family to Venezuela. Four years later he began studying the Venezuelan folk harp with his school friend Fernando Guerrero. A year later he became a pupil of Alberto Romero on the Paraguayan harp. Just two years after his first harp lesson, he began medical studies in Medellín, Colombia, began performing professionally and recorded his first album. Music supported his medical studies until graduation. Five years later he moved to the United States to continue studies of music therapy. Two years later he married Luz Marina Otero. For eight years from the time of his graduation from medical school, he worked in the medical field as well as a harpist and recording artist, until his wife became pregnant. In order to have time for his growing family, he then decided to dedicate his life only to them and to his first love: the harp.
With a multicultural repertoire which covers folk, classical and popular music of many countries, as well as his original compositions, Dr. Ortiz has performed for audiences of all ages and backgrounds. He has recorded over forty albums and is the winner of a Gold Record in South America. He has lectured on a variety of subjects at universities, colleges and schools, is the author of several harp music books and articles and his compositions have been performed and recorded by and [folk harpists in many countries. His “Venezolana for Five Pedal Harps” has become a favorite of harp ensembles around the world.
His acclaimed “South American Suite for Harp and Orchestra” premiered March 3, 1996. Dr Ortiz was invited to perform his Suite at the World Harp Congress in Prague, Czech Republic, in 1999, with the Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra, having as audience over one thousand classical harpists from around the world.

The Wild Puffalumps

The Wild Puffalumps was a 22-minute direct-to-video animated cartoon, based on the Puffalump toy line of the same name. It was produced by Nelvana, and released on videocassette in the United States by Family Home Entertainment in 1987 and in Canada by Cineplex Odeon and MCA.
This cartoon was intended to act as an advertisement for the “Wild Puffalumps” toy line, which consisted of vividly-colored Puffalumps wearing Aloha shirts and sunglasses whose lenses displayed the word “WILD” when seen at the proper angle. The glasses were large enough that the children who owned the toys could wear them, a fact which was pointed out in the television commercial for the toys.
In the cartoon, the characters all live on an island separate from the rest of the world, much like many other 1980s toy-based cartoon characters (Care Bears, My Little Pony, etc.). The two children who visit this place soon find themselves going on a journey, parts of which are like amusement park rides, and the word “wild” is repeatedly emphasized throughout the cartoon. All of this is intended to make the characters fit in with the current cartoon culture, as well as give the impression that the toys on which they’re based are fun and exciting.
The VHS videocassette has been currently out of print since the end of the 1980s, and the cartoon was never released on DVD, and as of April 16, 2013, Lionsgate has not announced any plans to release it on DVD. The Wild Puffalumps toys were sold in 1987 and discontinued the same year.

Jeff Miller (Lassie)

Jeff Miller is a fictional character in the long-running television series "Lassie" (1954–1973). Jeff is an eleven-year-old boy living on a weatherbeaten farm in the American midwest with his war-widowed mother, Ellen Miller, and his paternal grandfather, George "Gramps" Miller. The character was created by producer Robert Maxwell and Lassie trainer Rudd Weatherwax, and was portrayed by child actor Tommy Rettig. Jeff makes his first appearance in the series premiere, "The Inheritance" (1954), and his last appearance in the mid-fourth season episode, "Transition" (1957). The series won its only Emmy Awards during the character's stint on the show.
Role.
Jeff is the typical 1950s American boy. He enjoys boyhood adventure, collects baseball cards, and struggles a bit with school work. He is eleven-years-old when the show opens and is the son of slain war hero John Miller and his wife, Ellen. With his mother and paternal grandfather George Miller, Jeff lives on a weatherbeaten farm on the outskirts of the fictional small midwestern town of Calverton. Some fifty miles distant is Capitol City which Jeff sometimes visits. In one episode, he hitch-hikes to Capitol City to find medical help for Lassie when she loses her eyesight. On the not-so-nice side, Jeff surreptitiously listens-in on party-line telephone conversations at home, much to the annoyance of his mother. Jeff attends a one-room schoolhouse and has his own horse, Domino.
Production details.
Background.
In 1943, Eric Knight's fictional rough collie, Lassie, made her film debut in MGM's "Lassie Come Home." Canine star Pal, a male dog, appeared in the titular role. The success of the film generated six more MGM Lassie films, and, with the seventh feature, "The Painted Hills" (1951), Lassie's MGM career came to an end. Pal's owner and trainer, Rudd Weatherwax, took all rights to the Lassie name and trademark in lieu of back pay owed him by MGM and toured America with Pal in an 18-minute program starring "Lassie". Producer Robert Maxwell convinced Weatherwax that the dog's future lay in television. Together the men developed a scenario set on a weatherbeaten farm in Middle America about a struggling war widow, her son, her father-in-law, and their dog.
Casting.
Broadway star and television quiz show panelist Jan Clayton was cast as widowed, Ellen Miller, and septuagenarian film veteran George Cleveland cast as her father-in-law George Miller, but the boy in the scenario eluded producers until Rudd Weatherwax's brother Frank (who was working on the Dr. Seuss film, "The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.)" apprised its young star, Tommy Rettig of the "Lassie" television series being readied for production. Rettig later recalled, "...I was called in for an interview. At that time I was screen-tested, I read for the part and evidently I impressed some people. A few weeks later, it came down to me and two other kids. One was Lee Aker, who would eventually star in "Rin Tin Tin." They decided that all three of us could do the role. So the decision as to who got the role was essentially left up to Lassie...I spent a week with Rudd and Lassie out in North Hollywood at the Weatherwax's home. The other finalists did, too. The fact was that Lassie liked me better than he did the other two kids. I loved animals, and this seemed to be very important to Rudd, too."
Shortly after the show debuted, producers and writers decided Jeff needed a male companion his own age. Auditions were held with young actor Donald Keeler (Joey D. Vieira) defeating hundreds of other applicants for the role of Jeff's pal, Sylvester "Porky" Brockway. In conjunction with the role, writers created Porky's father, Matt Brockway, Porky's mother Birdie Brockway, and Porky's basset hound, Pokey (who appeared so frequently he was considered a regular by crew). Porky debuted in the show's first season episode, "The Lion" and saw his last appearance in the fourth season episode, "Timmy's Family" (1957). He was scripted into many episodes with Jeff, but, unknown to the show's audience, neither boy liked the other and feuded constantly off-screen.
First appearance.
Jeff makes his first appearance in the series premier, "The Inheritance" (1954). Shot in British Columbia, the episode was one of two pilots filmed for the show, the other being "The Well" which aired late in the first season.
"The Inheritance" brings Lassie and Jeff together when the boy receives the dog as a bequest from neighbor Homer Carey. Lassie however will have nothing to do with Jeff, breaking his heart time and again when she flees nightly from his bedside to sleep on the cold hearth in the dark and empty Carey house. There she remains hour after hour until Jeff solves a mystery involving a cache of hidden money and a hired hand with theft on his mind. The climax pitches Lassie against the thief in a tense battle.
In the episode's emotional last moments, Jeff has returned to the Miller farmhouse and waits anxiously on the doorstep with his mother and grandfather for Lassie to join him. Lassie remains at the end of the driveway, gazing down the road as if contemplating a return to her old home. Then she turns and bounds happily to Jeff. "She's mine now, isn't she, Gramps?" Jeff cries joyously to his grandfather. "Yes, she's all yours," Gramps replies, "She done her deciding."
Dogs.
Pal, the star of the several MGM "Lassie" films of the 1940s, appeared in the two pilots, and his son, Lassie Junior (or, Junior) appeared thereafter. Lassie Junior was joined on the set by several other dogs: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt dog for long distance action shots, and a "fight" dog for battles with other animals.
Leaving the show.
As the fourth season approached, Rettig was fifteen years old and had grown tired of playing the Jeff Miller role. He was dating, driving cars, making college plans, and wanted to leave the show to enjoy the life of a normal teenager.
Producer and show owner Jack Wrather realized Rettig couldn't play a boy forever and developed a new storyline with seven-year-old Jon Provost cast as Timmy, a foster child on the Miller farm. Timmy was teamed with Lassie for the sorts of adventures formerly assigned to Jeff. Rettig expected to be released any day but producers were happy with the status quo and made little effort to write Rettig out of the show.
A crisis was reached when series star George Cleveland died suddenly on July 17, 1957. Producers and writers were forced to completely overhaul the show. An episode called "Transition" was quickly scripted with a simple but believable plot: Ellen Miller and Jeff decide to sell the farm to Paul and Ruth Martin, a young couple new to the area. The two adopt Timmy. Jeff gives Lassie to Timmy, and then leaves for the city. Rettig was dropped and the character of Jeff was never seen on the show again. The Miller years of the show were almost immediately sold into world-wide syndication as "Jeff's Collie."
Awards.
"Lassie" won its only Emmy Awards (Best Children's Program 1955, and Best Children's Series 1956), during the Jeff years of the show. Tommy Rettig and co-star Donald Keeler jointly accepted the 1956 award. The show also received a 1956 Peabody Award.

Jock Wilson (serviceman)

John Nicholson "Jock" Wilson MM (7 September 1903 – 29 September 2008) was a British serviceman, who was Great Britain's oldest D-Day veteran. Wilson was a soldier in the 79th (Scottish Horse) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery. On 6 June 1944, during the Second World War, Wilson landed at Juno Beach and participated in the fighting that led to one of the biggest defeats for Germany.
Second World War.
Wilson joined the 79th Regiment of the Royal Artillery when many of his fellow soldiers were half his age. He was assigned to the radio division, which meant that his unit would land with the first group of soldiers on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Under constant attack, he and his comrades assembled a radio station to transmit information about the enemy's movements which helped the Allies determine where to deploy troops. Wilson was injured twice in the war and still had shrapnel in his arm after the war.
He was awarded the Military Medal for his actions on 14 February 1945, near the village of Viller in the Gennep municipality of the Netherlands. He was acting as technical assistant to Captain Fyffe who was attached to 1st Battalion, the Black Watch, as artillery observer, responsible for calling in artillery support and identifying targets. They had crossed the river Niers in a Buffalo overnight, and established their observation post in a flour mill in the battalion bridgehead. At around 0830, the German forces launched a counterattack, supported by self-propelled guns. Their observation post came under direct fire from two of these guns which scored 30–40 hits on the mill. Wilson was knocked down by the blast from one explosion, and hit by falling masonry but continued to assist Fyffe. Allied artillery was able to use the information provided to break up the counterattack. The award of the medal was gazetted on 24 May 1945.
Personal life.
John "Jock" Wilson was born on 7 September 1903 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He attended Leith Academy for his grammar school education. When he was fourteen, he began working at McNiven and Cameron's, who were the makers of the Waverley pens. Wilson met his wife, Lily (née Ross) during a tea party at a Marine Garden ballroom in Seafield. They married in October 1934 in Morningside and had a daughter called Joyce. When Joyce was only two weeks old, Jock Wilson flew to Normandy to fight with the 79th Regiment of the Royal Artillery against Nazi Germany.
After the death of his wife in 1964, he moved from Edinburgh to Dunbar so that he could live with Joyce and her husband, Tom. In that East Lothian town, he was considered a "central figure" at Remembrance Day services. During the Remembrance Services in 2001, Wilson placed a poppy on a memorial at the Princes Street Gardens. Wilson lived with his daughter for 43 years before moving to the Hollytrees Nursing Home in Belhaven Hospital in 2007.
Awards and honours.
In addition to his Military Medal Wilson also received the Légion d'honneur, a prestigious military award of France, from Gérard Errera, the French ambassador, in London. When he was 90 years-old, Wilson became an honorary member of the Dunbar and District Probus Club. He also received the "Our Forces Hero" award from the Daily Record and dedicated it to the soldiers who had lost their lives on D-Day in Normandy. In October 2004, Jock attended both the opening of the new Parliament in Edinburgh and Scotland's World Cup Qualifier against Norway at Hampden Park. He watched both events, which were 50 miles apart, in a limousine.
Known for his sense of humour, when Wilson and other veterans were meeting dignitaries after an awards ceremony, he said to Queen Elizabeth II, whom he had already met that day, "You know, madam, we'll have to stop meeting like this." Later, when he met the then-Prime Minister, Tony Blair, Wilson joked, "The only person to go into parliament with good intentions was Guy Fawkes, and he forgot his matches."
Wilson celebrated his 105th birthday at the Dunbar Club and received a bottle of malt. He also received a second birthday card from Queen Elizabeth II, which was presented to him by East Lothian’s Lord Lieutenant, Garth Morrison, at the Belhaven Hospital. He had received the first card from the Queen on his 104th birthday.
Death and funeral service.
Jock Wilson died in Dunbar, Scotland, on 29 September 2008, at the age of 105. His funeral service was held at the Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh. It was conducted by Charles Robertson, the Chaplain to the Normandy Veterans Association.

<doc id="19645022" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19645022" title="Bulk electrolysis">
Bulk electrolysis

Bulk electrolysis is also known as "potentiostatic coulometry" or "controlled potential coulometry". The experiment is a form of coulometry which generally employs a three electrode system controlled by a potentiostat. In the experiment the working electrode is held at a constant potential (volts) and current (amps) is monitored over time (seconds). In a properly run experiment an analyte is quantitatively converted from its original oxidation state to a new oxidation state, either reduced or oxidized. As the substrate is consumed, the current also decreases, approaching zero when the conversion nears completion. 
The results of a "bulk electrolysis" are visually displayed as the total coulombs passed (total electric charge) plotted against time in seconds, even through the experiment measures electric current (amps) over time. This is done to show that the experiment is approaching an expected total number of coulombs. 
Fundamental relationships and applications.
The sample mass, molecular mass, number of electrons in the electrode reaction, and number of electrons passed during the experiment are all related by Faraday's laws of electrolysis. It follows that, if three of the values are known, then the fourth can be calculated. The bulk electrolysis can also be useful for synthetic purposes if the product of the electrolysis can be isolated. This is most convenient when the product is neutral and can be isolated from the electrolyte solution through extraction or when the product plates out on the electrode or precipitates in another fashion. Even if the product can not be isolated, other analytical techniques can be performed on the solution including NMR, EPR, UV-Vis, FTIR, among others techniques depending on the specific situation. In specially designed cells the solution can be actively monitored during the experiment.
Cell design.
In most three electrode experiments there are two isolated cells. One contains the auxiliary and working electrode, while the other contains the reference electrode. Strictly speaking, the reference electrode does not require a separate compartment. A Quasi-Reference Electrode such as a silver/silver chloride wire electrode can be exposed directly to the analyte solution. In such situations there is concern that the analyte and trace redox products may interact with the reference electrode and either render it useless or increase drift. As a result even these simple references are commonly sequestered in their own cells. The more complex references such as standard hydrogen electrode, saturated calomel electrode, or silver chloride electrode(specific concentration) can not directly mix the analyte solution for fear the electrode will fall apart or interact/react with the analyte.
A bulk electrolysis is best performed in a three part cell in which both the auxiliary electrode and reference electrode have their own cell which connects to the cell containing the working electrode. This isolates the undesired redox events taking place at the auxiliary electrode. During bulk electrolysis, the analyte undergoes a redox event at the working electrode. If the system was open, then it would be possible for the product of that reaction to diffuse back to the auxiliary electrode and undergo the inverse redox reaction. In addition to maintaining the proper current at the working electrode, the auxiliary electrode will experience extreme potentials often oxidizing or reducing the solvent or electrolyte to balance the current. In voltammetry experiments, the currents (amps) are so small and it is not a problem to decompose a small amount of solvent or electrolyte. In contrast, a bulk electrolysis involves currents greater by several orders of magnitude. At the auxiliary electrode, this greater current would decompose a significant amount of the solution/electrolyte and probably boiling the solution in the process all in an effort to balance the current. To mitigate this challenge the auxiliary cell will often contain a stoichiometric or greater amount of "sacrificial reductant" (ferrocene) or "sacrificial oxidant" (ferrocenium) to balance the overall redox reaction.
For ideal performance the auxiliary electrode should be similar in surface area, as close as possible, and evenly spaced with the working electrode. This is in an effort to prevent "hot spots". Hot spots are the result of current following the path of least resistance. This means much of the redox chemistry will occur at the points at either end of the shortest path between the working and auxiliary electrode. Heating associated with the capacitances resistance of the solution can occur at the area around these points, actually boiling the solution. The bubbling resulting from this isolated boiling of the solution can be confused with gas evolution. 
Rates and kinetics.
The rate of such reactions/experiments is not determined by the concentration of the solution, but rather the mass transfer of the substrate in the solution to the electrode surface. Rates will increase when the volume of the solution is decreased, the solution is stirred more rapidly, or the area of the working electrode is increased. Since mass transfer is so important the solution is stirred during a bulk electrolysis. However, this technique is generally not considered a hydrodynamic technique, since a laminar flow of solution against the electrode is neither the objective or outcome of the siring.
Bulk electrolysis is occasionally cited in the literature as means to study electrochemical reaction rates. However, bulk electrolysis is generally a poor method to study electrochemical reaction rates since the rate of bulk electrolysis is generally governed by the specific cells ability to perform mass transfer. Rates slower than this mass transfer bottleneck are rarely of interest. 
Efficiency and thermodynamics.
Electrocatalytic analyzes will often mention the "current efficiency" or faradaic efficiency of a given process determined by a bulk electrolysis experiment. For example if one molecule of hydrogen results from every two electrons inserted into an acidic solution then the faradaic efficiency would be 100%. This indicates that the electrons did not ended up performing some other reaction. For example the oxidation of water will often produce oxygen as well as hydrogen peroxide at the anode. Each of these products is related to its own faradaic efficiency which is tied to the experimental arrangement.
Nor is current efficiency the same as thermodynamic efficiency, since it never address the how much energy (potential in volts) is in the electrons added or removed. The voltage efficiency determined by the reactions overpotential is more directly related to the thermodynamics of the electrochemical reaction. In fact the extent to which a reaction goes to completion is related to how much greater the applied potential is than the reduction potential of interest. In the case where multiple reduction potentials are of interest, it is often difficult to set an electrolysis potential a "safe" distance (such as 200 mV) past a redox event. The result is incomplete conversion of the substrate, or else conversion of some of the substrate to the more reduced form. This factor must be considered when analyzing the current passed and when attempting to do further analysis/isolation/experiments with the substrate solution.

California Proposition 12 (2008)

Proposition 12 appeared on the November 4, 2008 ballot in California. It is also known as the Veterans' Bond Act of 2008. The measure was legislatively referred to the ballot in Senate Bill 1572. The primary sponsor of SB 1572 was Senator Mark Wyland, R-Carlsbad. The vote to place the measure on the ballot was passed unanimously in both the California state senate (39-0) and assembly (75-0).
The ballot proposition passed in November and it authorizes issuance of $900 million in bonds to create a fund to assist veterans who are purchasing farms, homes and mobile home properties. 
Fiscal impact.
The non-partisan California Legislative Analyst's Office estimated the proposition will result in costs of about $1.8 billion to pay off both the principal ($900 million) and interest ($856 million) on the bonds; costs paid by participating veterans. Average payment for principal and interest of about $59 million per year for 30 years."
History of veterans' bonds in California.
California began the veterans' home loan programs in 1922. California voters have subsequently been asked 27 times to fund the program and have voted "yes" all 26 times, for a total of $8.4 billion in the past. The 2008 effort was the 27th time voters were asked to support the program. Prop. 12's request for $900 million is the largest request for a Cal-Vet bond.

Eureka goes through a physical and emotional change after she comes in contact with the Scub Coral at the LFO dig site. 
Later in the series it is revealed that she was sent by the Scub Coral in human form to gather information about the human race. A clean slate to experience everything in 'similar' human life, information that can be passed to the Scub Coral to learn from humanity. The reason why the Scub Coral did this was because the humans (from 10,000 years ago) were scared about the contact with the Scub Coral (since they didn't know that it was a sentient life form) and left the planet. That's why she doesn't have any prior knowledge of humans or her own identity before the time of her discovery.
The contanct with the Scub Coral is a turning point in her relationship with Renton, because Renton feels responsible for the event to happen in the first place. During the time he left the Gekko, she begins to think about the feelings she has for him and realizes she wants to be with him forever. Upon his return, they enter in a relationship and are always seen together. Although she tends to be naïve over how Renton tries to bond with her, their relationship is able to make seemingly miraculous events occur, such as going to Earth and saving the world from the Limit of Questions.
In "Eureka Seven: AO" (about seven to ten years later after the ending of the first series), she has two children with Renton: An unnamed daughter who died shortly after she was born, and a boy they named Ao. During both pregnancies, Eureka was transported into the past; after Ao's birth, she was forced to leave her son behind in order to save the "past" world from a great calamity. In "AO", she had become human-like and is always seen smiling, and is a loving wife and mother.
Relationships.
Renton Thurston.
Renton is Eureka's co-pilot and soul mate. Renton and Eureka's relationship goes through many changes throughout the story. It begins with Renton having a crush on Eureka, who crashes into Axel Thurston's garage, and Eureka, who didn't understand human nature and emotions at the time, didn't reciprocate his feelings. She is one of the main reasons that Renton joins Gekkostate. Over time, Renton starts to understand how his role affects Eureka and the typeZERO, and he vows to protect her. As she comes to realize how much Renton means to her, she begins to fall in love with him and discovers a desire to make him happy with her. After knowing the truth about her origins, she's scared that Renton will leave her because of that but this doesn't matter for Renton because he simply doesn't care about her origins and it is his acceptance of everything about her that leads to a strong bond of trust between them. Eureka never formally marries Renton, but the family record book that Axel carries around lists her as "Eureka Thurston". In "", Eureka and Renton finally married and had two biological children: a daughter, who died shortly after birth, and a son named Ao.
Maurice, Maeter, and Linck.
Maurice, Maeter, and Linck are children rescued from Ciudades del Cielo while Eureka and Holland were still in the Special Forces. As she killed their families prior to realizing what she done, Eureka took them and became a foster mother to them. Before Renton serves as a male role model for the kids and shows Eureka how to discipline them, they are often unruly and disobedient. They love Eureka very much, and tease Renton and sometimes cause trouble for Gekkostate. In the end, Eureka, Renton and the kids consider themselves a real family.
Holland Novak.
Eureka joined Holland's Special Forces squad when she was found next to the typeZERO and proved to be the perfect pilot for it. Holland thought of himself as Eureka's partner, but Norb stated that Eureka will have a partner other than Holland and Dewey. He said that her true partner will be the boy that can make her smile from her heart. Still, Holland protects Eureka from harm and does not accept Renton as her partner until the end of season two. Because of his treatment towards Renton, their relationship is sometimes a little strained.
Ao Fukai.
Ao is the son of Eureka and Renton. While pregnant with her son, Eureka was forced into the past by Renton in order to save her, and she fell from the sky on the Okinawa island, and gave birth to Ao soon afterwards. Eureka and Renton decided to name their son "Ao Thurston" before his birth. She raised Ao for the first two years of his life, but she was later taken away by the American Forces, never to be seen again. It is later revealed that she is in limbo between worlds due to merging with the Quartz in order to protect Ao. Ao then decides to save her by going back in time to reunite her with his father, and return them to their world. From Ao's memories and in later episodes, Eureka loved her son dearly and was saddened to leave him.
The Thurston family.
After Eureka was found, Axel Thurston took part in building new technologies for the typeZERO. Adroc Thurston assists Eureka until his mysterious disappearance (he is later revealed to have been with the Scub Corals). Renton also introduces Eureka to his sister, Diane Thurston, later in the series. Eureka is listed as "Eureka Thurston" in the family record book that Axel is reading at the end of episode 50, implying she took Renton's last name.In "Eureka Seven: AO", she and Renton are officially married and become parents to two biological children: an unnamed daughter and a son, Ao.
Gekkostate.
Eureka has special status in Gekkostate as a skilled pilot and one of the organization's original members. She is respected in Gekkostate for her partnership with Holland and later Renton, and for her role as adoptive mother to Maurice, Maeter, and Linck.
Manga.
Eureka's manga incarnation is not terribly similar to her anime incarnation. In the manga version the story ends with Eureka being in the Zone and Anemone using Nirvash "typeTHEEND" to implement a virus program into the Coralians. Dominic also helps Renton in efforts to stop the virus and saving the ones they care the most. Like in the anime, Renton was able to profess his love toward Eureka; however, Eureka vanished with the Coralians. Renton lives with Eureka's adopted children Maurice, Maeter, and Linck and his grandfather Axel Thurston in Bellforest. Renton works on the windmill and anticipates on Eureka's return, denying any possibility that Eureka is dead.
Movie.
Renton and Eureka meet as young children and become fast friends. She can't go outside in the daytime because the sun's light burns her skin, which reveals a green underlayer. They went with Professor Dominic to see a rainbow flower one evening, but their happiness is temporary, for the military arrives soon after and abducts Eureka, leaving Renton distraught. Eight years later, Renton, now a child soldier and KLF pilot, finds Eureka and saves her. Holland then reveals that Eureka is the military's top secret project, and she further elaborates to Renton that she is a spy robot that the Image created to spy on humankind, and that she would likely die young (her remaining life was denoted by the red ring in her eyes, which by then resembled a crescent and would shrink as her life faded). After Renton sustains a gunshot to the abdomen, Eureka vows to have a future with Renton, which angered the Gekkostate to kill an elder Anemone to stop their plans. Then an EIZO hand attacks her and Anemone only for Renton and an evolved Nirvash - the pure one - to rescue her. They escape only for Holland to follow and attack them. They manage to escape Holland, but Renton succumbs to his injuries. Eureka confesses her love to the unconscious Renton and bids him farewell, believing they will meet again as long as he survives. Then Nirvash pierced the command cluster just seconds before "The Hammer of God" strikes it. The planet is then flooded when "Image" turns into water. When Renton wakes up on the coastal area of his homeland Warsaw, he sees a naked Eureka with long hair and she is incapable of speech due to a complete loss of memory, but is no longer affected by the Sun. His wound is completely gone, and a large Larva Nirvash appears before them. Before Nirvash disappears into light fragments, he told Renton that he and Eureka can fly now even without wings and that their own two feet will carry themselves to the future. Renton clothed Eureka with his jacket and she points out a rainbow and an incoming space shuttle. Eureka then kisses Renton on the left side of his face and hold his hands dearly, implying their happiness ever after. 
Note that this is the only version of the story that Eureka has turned into an ordinary human being, noted by the absence of the red ring on her eyes, as well as her continued existence despite the vanishing of her creator "Image" which caused Anemone and Nirvash to follow suit (contrary to the manga ending).
Reception.
Eureka was ranked 18th in the female character category of the Anime Grand Prix in 2005.
In his review of the series' first DVD, Theron Martin of Anime News Network described Eureka as "calm, sensible, and soft-spoken but not necessarily shy...and is quite capable of showing joy, sadness, or earnestness without resorting to the exaggerated expressions and reactions so common in anime." Martin also said in his review of the sixth DVD that "Eureka is hardly the first person in an anime series who struggles to understand and cope with...love, but she does it more convincingly than most."

<poem>
Hi Uncle Sam!
When freedom was denied you,
And imperial might defied you,
Who was it stood beside you
At Quebec and Brandywine?
And dared retreats and dangers,
Red-coats and Hessian strangers,
In the lean, long-rifled Rangers,
And the Pennsylvania Line!
Hi! Uncle Sam!
Wherever there was fighting,
Or wrong that needed writing,
An Ulsterman was sighting
His Kentucky gun with care:
All the road to Yorktown,
From Lexington to Yorktown,
From Valley Forge to Yorktown,
That Ulsterman was there!
Hi! Uncle Sam!
Virginia sent her brave men,
The North paraded grave men,
That they might not be slavemen,
But ponder this with calm:
The first to face the Tory,
And the first to lift Old Glory,
Made your war an Ulster story:
Think it over, Uncle Sam!

Provincial museums of Canada are museums maintained by the provinces of Canada to preserve their local history and culture. They are the equivalent to national museums operated by nation-states.
In the mostly French-speaking province of Quebec, the provincial government uses the term "national" to refer to provincial museums, reflecting the strength of Quebec nationalism.
Many provinces have separate facilities for history and natural history museums, art galleries, and archives. In the case of Newfoundland and Labrador, all these functions are housed in one complex, The Rooms, in St. John's

Renton Thurston

Character outline.
Renton thinks his life is mundane and dreams of doing the extraordinary. At the beginning of the series, he becomes a member of Gekkostate in order to be near his idol, Holland, and his love at first sight, Eureka. In seasons one and two, the other crew members generally see Renton as Gekkostate's "busboy", doing chores such as cooking and cleaning. He occasionally rides with Eureka in the Nirvash typeZERO and is able to lift. The constant conflict with Holland makes Renton quit the Gekkostate and then bails out of the Gekko-Go (crew). He spends time on the ship of Charles and Ray Beams. He then leaves them after finding out shocking news from Charles on how their mission is to capture Eureka and the Nirvash: Type Zero. He returns to Gekkostate only to warn them that they were walking into a trap and to protect Eureka at all cost. He then rejoins Gekkostate in the third season. In the third season, Renton is shown to mature a bit. Eureka and Renton continue to pilot the typeZERO, and his relationship with Eureka deepens, though the kids (Maurice, Maeter, and Linck) still refuse to regard Renton as their "papa". In season four Renton matures even further, coming into his own as a father to the kids and willing to sacrifice his own life to be able to be with Eureka forever.
Approximately seven to ten years later, Renton and Eureka are married and have two children together; a daughter who died shortly after birth and a son named Ao. When Eureka was pregnant with their daughter, they were conducting an experiment to see why Scub Coral was vanishing (using the "Gekko" as part of it) and she temporarily vanished into the past, where she met Ao, who returned her to her world. Around this time, Renton was being hailed as a genius for combining his knowledge of Scub Coral and LFOs, creating the first IFO. After the death of their daughter from the high level of trapar, Renton decided to destroy the Scub Coral in order to prevent their second child from suffering the same fate. By the time Eureka was pregnant with their son, he forced her into the past to ensure Ao would survive. He later met Ao for the first time and was reunited with Eureka, and Ao saved them by helping them return to their world. In "Eureka Seven: AO", he has grown mature, calm, and serious, but is a loving husband and father.
Relationships.
Eureka.
Eureka has been with Renton ever since the typeZERO crashed at Axel Thurston's garage. Renton falls in love with her right away, but she doesn't reciprocate his feelings until season two, due to her lack of understanding human nature and emotions. She realized her love for him when he left the Gekko and she missed him. Upon his return, they enter in a relationship and are always seen together. In episode 34, Holland says, "Eureka's partner is you, Renton." The growth of their relationship is reflected by the fact that the typeZERO requires both Eureka and Renton as pilots to maximize its capability. Their connection is similar to the one that Sakuya has with Norb and Anemone has with Dominic, but Eureka and Renton's relationship gets the most development throughout the story. Eureka never formally marries Renton, though at the end of the series Axel Thurston lists Eureka as "Eureka Thurston" in the family record book. In "", Renton and Eureka finally married and had two biological children: a daughter, who died shortly after birth, and a son named Ao.
Maurice, Maeter, and Linck.
Maurice, Maeter, and Linck are Eureka's adopted kids. In seasons one and two, the relationship between Renton and the kids is hostile, due to their belief that he is trying to take eureka, whom they think of as their mother, away from them. In seasons three and four, their relationship deepens as Renton serves as a father figure to them, although they still hesitated to refer to him as their father. Eventually, they accept him as their father; seen in episode 50, when Maurice is able to implicitly call Renton "papa". Maeter's and Linck's feelings toward Renton are not as clearly stated, but several scenes imply that they too feel that Renton is their "papa". In episode 50, the kids are listed in the family record book as Renton's adopted kids.
Ao Fukai.
Ao is the son of Renton and Eureka. Ao closely resembles his father and is more upfront than Renton is. Despite being his son, Ao knew nothing about him and assumed that Renton was a deadbeat father who left him and Eureka. But as Ao searched for Eureka, he learned that Renton sent Eureka and Ao to the past in order to save them and was trying to destroy the Scub Coral in Ao's world in order to prevent Ao from suffering the same fate as Ao's older sister, who died. However, this is paradox; Eureka was born from the Scub Coral, and some of it needed to remain otherwise Renton's efforts would be pointless. Ao is happy and touched that his father loves him, and decided to repay his parents for giving him life and protecting him by having them reunited and returned to their world. It is also revealed that Renton was the one responsible for building the Nirvash that Ao pilots.
Gekkostate.
In the first and second seasons, Renton was looked down upon by crew members of the Gekko, and was forced to do maid-like chores. He was dismissed or ignored by his crew mates, subjected to pranks by the children, and abused physically and emotionally by Holland. Renton is able to pilot the Nirvash with Eureka, but when Eureka was hospitalized, Renton is forbidden to pilot the Nirvash for a short time. Eventually, coming to believe he is hated by everyone, including Eureka, Renton quit the Gekko. However, after he returns, the members of Gekkostate respect Renton more and Holland acknowledges his status as Eureka's partner. He also gains the trust of Holland as he matures and his skills as a LFO pilot improve. In seasons three and four, Renton's relationship with the Gekkostate crew becomes that of a familial one. Holland's final words toward Renton are, "It's just like him to graduate without consent." when he's going after Eureka.
Charles and Ray.
When Renton quits Gekkostate, he meets Charles and Ray in a town. The two of them bring him to their ship and allow him to stay with them. While Renton lives with them, they treat him as their son and Renton feels happy and accepted. Charles teaches Renton about the Trapars and how to feel them. However, when Renton discovers that they have received instructions to attack the Gekko and capture Eureka and The Type Zero, he decides to leave. Renton returns to the Gekko only to warn Holland and the others of the trap they were headed into and to protect Eureka at all cost. Charles and Ray are killed by Holland. Charles dies on the Gekko after an all out death match with Holland. Ray dies aboard the swan after taking a direct hit to the Bridge and a following explosion. Renton realizes that he must use what Charles has taught him to protect Eureka.
Thurston family.
Before joining the Gekkostate, Renton lived with his grandfather, Axel, who was protective of him and tried to prevent him from joining the Gekko. His father, Adroc, is a famous military hero who saved the world from the first Summer of Love. He was later declared dead, but Renton felt no sympathy towards his father due to his belief that Adroc cared more about his research than the family. Renton was close to his older sister, Diane, and she raised him until she too disappeared after deciding to continue their father's research. It was later revealed that Adroc and Diane are not dead, but had emerged with the Scub Coral. Renton was able to met with them near the end of the series, and express his forgiveness towards his father. 
Dominic Sorel.
Renton's only meeting with Dominic is in the first season finale where they are forced to work together to retrieve medicine for the injured Eureka and Anemone. In spite of his knowledge that Dominic is on the opposite side, as well as taking note to his hapless quirks, Renton leaves on good terms with Dominic. Although he never personally sees Dominic again, he gains enough of an understanding of his relationship with Anemone that he helps her try to accept his feelings.
Manga.
Eureka seveN's manga version differs from the anime version. Please advice that this synopsis only covers Vol. 6. Renton Thurston was seriously injured as he flew Eureka to the Zone. Anemone was able to get into the Zone first not knowingly that Nirvash "typeTHEEND" was sending a deadly virus to the Coralians. Here as seen, Eureka and Anemone (when not drugged) were not enemies, but long-time friends. Dominic attempted to help Renton with his quest to save Eureka from the zone. There he was confronted with the Coralians. Renton was first assigned to act as decoy for Dominic, however, when Dominic pilots Nirvash "TypeTHEEND" the machine's arm wasn't fixed yet. Renton went into the Zone while Dominic faces off death by the Coralians. Renton was able to meet a false Eureka that manipulated him to be eaten by the Coralians. Eureka was able to get out of the Coralian's imprisonment and prevent Renton to be eaten thus saved the world. At the end, like the anime, Renton was able to profess his love toward Eureka (although much earlier he already did), but Eureka materialized with the Coralians. The ending was two years after this incident. Renton lives with Eureka's adopted children, Maurice, Maeter, and Linck, and his grandfather, Axel Thurston, in Bellforest. He works at a windmill and anticipates the return of Eureka, as he refuses to mourn her death.
Movie.
When Renton was a young boy he became friends with Eureka. He with Eureka and Larva Nirvash went with Professor Dominic to witness a rainbow flower's bloom. The army took Eureka away and Renton didn't know what to do. When Eight years pass, Renton became a soldier and serves with the Gekkostate. During a mission, Renton finds Eureka and rescues her thus evolving Nirvash in a different body. Renton learns that the Gekkostate are not really working with the army only for them to use Renton and Eureka to find Neverland so they can stay young. When Renton was injured by a gunshot, he sees Dominic's spirit and tells him to not let go of his feelings and for him to "Don't ask for it, do it forself, or you won't get nothing" which Renton rose up and evolve Nirvash again to a new form (which is not the form we saw in the TV series) and he and Eureka escapes. Holland went after them and fought them, which he activated his hard drive only to find out that Talho is pregnant with Holland's child and with that he lost the fight with Renton and Eureka. Renton pass out from his wound as Eureka told him it will be alright as Nirvash pierce the command cluster so that "The Hammer of God" can enter the Command Cluster to destroy it. When Renton woke up, he sees a naked Eureka with long hair and her voice is messed up, his wound was gone, and Larva Nirvash is big. Before Larva Nirvash disappear into fragments of light, he told Renton that he and Eureka can fly now even without wings and that their own two feet can carry them to the future. As Renton and Eureka with his jacket on her are wondering, Eureka pointed to Renton that there are two rainbows and a rescue shuttle that comes to pick them up and than Eureka kiss Renton on his left side of his face. As Renton and Eureka hold each other's hand, Renton realize that both Dominic and Nirvash were both right and that Renton smiles as he knows that he and Eureka will have a happy future together.
Reception.
Anime News Network stated in its review of the series' first DVD that "Renton is a pretty normal male lead for a series like this." However, while initially describing him as immature, the site said in its review of the seventh DVD that "Renton proves that he has grown up a bit by not being thrown for a loop by learning what makes Eureka special."

Along with the ten-volume Encyclopedia, Larkin also wrote the All Time Top 1000 Albums, and edited the "Guinness Who’s Who Of Jazz", the "Guinness Who’s Who Of Blues", and the "Virgin Encyclopaedia Of Heavy Rock" The compiler of the most extensive database of popular music in Europe and the US, a writer and book designer by trade, Larkin has over 650,000 copies in print to date. As an expert in the field of popular music, Larkin has often been interviewed on radio, and had a regular slot on BBC GLR for two years in the 1990s.
Background and education.
Colin Larkin was born in Dagenham in 1949 in an area of Essex that was largely populated by workers in the car industry. Although the post-war years proved lucrative for the Ford motor company, Larkin was raised in relative poverty in the largest area of council housing in the United Kingdom, in the suburbs that surrounded the Ford plant. The Becontree estate in Dagenham began as a conglomeration of 27,000 "homes for heroes", and had no recognisable town centre.
Larkin spent much of his early childhood attending the travelling fair where his father, who worked by day as a plumber for the council, moonlighted on the waltzers to make ends meet. It was in the fairground, against a background of Little Richard on the wind-up 78 rpm turntables, that Larkin acquired his passion for the world of popular music, and a taste for exotic pattern and vivid colour, which would re-surface in later years in books on Islamic Art and Architecture, and Oriental rugs.
In the 1950s Larkin attended the South East Essex County Technical High School following which, under his own initiative he obtained an apprenticeship as a commercial artist, enabling him to take a sandwich course at the London College of Printing (now the London College of Communication). There he studied typography and book design. and was influenced by the typeface designer Eric Gill, who is associated with the Arts and Crafts movement.
Art and publishing.
Larkin began his working life in commercial art, advertising design groups and for the book publisher Pearson Longmans. In 1967 he began writing for music journals and magazines. At Longmans he became senior book designer, but he soon tired of working for the publishing house and by 1976 had co-founded his own book publishing company, Scorpion Publishing.
From the outset Larkin was intent upon reaching areas of the book reading public that other publishers felt it unnecessary or unprofitable to reach. Scorpion Publishing published art books on Oriental carpets and Islamic Art. They also designed and published John Gorman's trilogy of Labour history, "Banner Bright", "To Build Jerusalem" and "Images of Labour".
Notable music titles at this time included "Timeless Flight: The Definitive Story of The Byrds" and "Bob Dylan’s Unreleased Recordings".
In the 1980s Larkin, who read music magazines avidly and was acquiring a considerable personal library of singles and albums, began to consider the idea of "an encyclopedia of popular music". His passion for an encyclopaedia that would do for Bob Dylan and the Beatles what the "Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians" had done for more classical subjects, and moreover do it better, finally took over when in 1989 he sold his half of Scorpion Books to fund the project and founded Square One Books.
"The Encyclopedia of Popular Music".
In 1989 Larkin formed "Square One Books" to create a multi-volume "Encyclopedia of Popular Music", and to publish music related books. He published additional music biographies including those on Graham Bond, R.E.M., Eric Clapton, The Byrds and Frank Zappa, and a further book on Bob Dylan, "Oh No, Not Another Bob Dylan Book".
In a pre-internet age, the work required to create an encyclopaedia of popular music was considerable. Aided by a team of contributors, a fast-growing library of music magazines, books and the music itself, an eventual 2000 vinyl singles, 3000 vinyl albums, 4000 music biographies and 30,000 CDs, Larkin began compiling the "Encyclopedia".
In 1992 the first edition of the "Encyclopedia of Popular Music" went into print. 
It was quickly recognised as monumental: "Rolling Stone" described the work as "musical history in the making", in "The Times" they called it "a work of almost frightening completeness". Musician Jools Holland called it "without question the most useful reference work on popular music".
Square One developed their own in-house software using 4th Dimension.
Over 50 separate titles followed the creation of the Encyclopedia's database, and in 1997 Larkin sold Square One Books to American data company Muze. Larkin became full time editor-in-chief and ran the encyclopedia as a cottage industry, with a team of fewer than ten contributors, who in terms of wordcount were "producing an Agatha Christie novel a month".
From September 2008 Larkin ceased all involvement with Muze Inc. or any of its related companies following the closure of the "Encyclopedia of Popular Music" as a stand alone product and his subsequent redundancy. On 15 April 2009, it was announced that most of the assets of Muze Inc. were purchased by Macrovision.
In May 2011 Omnibus Press released the Amazon Kindle edition of the "Encyclopedia Of Popular Music", using the text of the 2007 edition.
Best Things on Earth.
By 2007, Larkin had begun work on a new website whose original inspiration had come from the "All Time Top 1000 Albums", called 1000Greatest.com. This would later become the multi-media rating site and app, Best Things On Earth. 
In 2012, on the 50th anniversary of The Beatles chart hit Love Me Do, Larkin was interviewed by BBC Entertainment Reporter Mark Savage about the Beatles' rivals in 1962.

James Herbert Veitch

James Herbert Veitch F.L.S., F.R.H.S. (1 May 1868 – 13 November 1907), was a member of the Veitch family who were distinguished horticulturists and nursery-men for over a century.
Early days.
James was born at Chelsea, London, the elder son of John Gould Veitch (1839–1870) and his wife Jane Hodge. His father died of tuberculosis shortly after he was born and the family nursery based in Chelsea was afterwards managed by his uncle, Harry.
He was educated at Crawford College, Maidenhead, and in technical subjects in Germany and France, beginning work at the Chelsea, London branch of the family nursery in 1885. He was elected fellow of the Linnean Society in 1889 and was also a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society.
Plant collecting.
In October 1891 he embarked on a tour of inspection of the great Botanic and Public Gardens maintained by governments in various centres as well as visiting many private horticultural establishments, to endeavour whether the Veitch gardens might be enriched by further additions. He set off by way of Rome and Naples to Ceylon, thence overland from Tuticorin to Lahore. He continued to Calcutta and on to the Straits Settlements. In Penang he visited the Botanic Gardens, whose curator Charles Curtis was formerly employed by James Veitch & Sons as a plant collector, before moving on to Singapore where he visited the Botanic Gardens. He then visited Johore, before returning to Singapore in February 1892, when he climbed Bukit Timah (the highest point on the island) with Walter Fox, curator of the Gardens.
He then travelled to Buitenzorg, West Java where he visited the Botanical Gardens. He also explored the crater of Kawah Papandajan (volcano), and visited Lake Bagendit near Garoet.
His travels then took him to Japan, where he met Charles Sprague Sargent of the Arnold Arboretum, and they undertook a joint plant collecting expedition including ascending Mount Hakkoda together. After visiting Korea, he reached Australia in 1893. However he found Australia disappointing and wrote that it was easier to collect seed in Japan where there was cheap labour; in Australia "no one will help". He complained that the seeds of many plants "were so tiny he did not know if he was collecting seed or dust". He sent to Kew a collection of dried specimens of 250 species from Western Australia. Later he visited the North Island of New Zealand, before returning to England in July 1893.
Among the results of his journey was the introduction of the large winter-cherry, "Physalis alkekengi franchetii". He also re-introduced "Rhododendron schlippenbachii" and "Vitis coignetiae".
A series of letters on the gardens visited during the journey was printed in the "Gardener’s Chronicle" (March 1892 – Dec 1894), and privately printed collectively as ""A Traveller’s Notes"" in 1896.
Veitch Nurseries.
In 1898 the firm of James Veitch & Sons was formed into a limited company, of which Veitch became managing director. One of the first steps taken by the company, in accordance with the firm’s earlier practice, was to send out Ernest Henry Wilson to China and Tibet to collect plants. 
The business proved too much for James, and he suffered a nervous breakdown. He became withdrawn and eccentric, offended customers, and business began to decline. After his death at only 39 years of age, his brother John succeeded to the Chelsea business. He also did not have the ability to run the business successfully, and his uncle Sir Harry Veitch returned to take over control and put the business back on track. Following John's death in October 1914 at the age of 45, Sir Harry (who was knighted in 1912) closed the business.
James died of paralysis at Exeter on 13 November 1907, and was buried there. He had been married in 1898 to Lucy Elizabeth Wood, who survived him without issue.
"Hortus Veitchii".
In 1906 Veitch, assisted by various members of his family, prepared for private distribution, under the title of "Hortus Veitchii", a sumptuous history of the firm and its collectors, illustrated with portraits. The botanical nomenclature was revised by George Nicholson, curator of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. 
This book was a study of the history of the botanical plant collecting explorers and hybridists, working for the nurseries of Robert Veitch and Son, Exeter and James Veitch and Sons, Chelsea during the period of 1840–1906. The book detailed the 1500 plants the business had introduced and their origins and the lengths its collectors went to secure them (the Veitch nurseries were the first to employ professional plant-hunters). The limited edition volumes were not for general consumption but gifts to libraries, universities, botanists and prestigious customers. Copies of the 1906 edition are now extremely rare and achieve prices of up to £1000.
In 2006, Exeter horticulturist Caradoc Doy, an authority on the Veitch Nursery, re-published a facsimile of this seminal work to mark its centenary. Doy went to great lengths to ensure the authenticity of the book. He meticulously sourced a thick, slightly yellowy paper to mirror the Victorian original and even had a special brass stamping plate made to replicate the cover embossing.
"Hortus Veitchii" is an essential reference for plants introduced during the Victorian era, listing many which are still available from nurseries today and therefore helping gardeners to accurately replicate historic gardens within that period. This is also important for those wishing to preserve rare plants introduced to Britain at that time, as well as being a fascinating historical account of Victorian plant collecting.

The Guild of Boston Artists

The Guild of Boston Artists (The Guild) was founded in 1914 by a handful of Boston artists working in the academic and realist traditions. Among the founding members were Frank Weston Benson, William McGregor Paxton and Edmund C. Tarbell, who served as its first president through 1924. The organization holds exhibitions of its members' work several times a year as well as numerous one-person shows. Founded with the intention to promote the highest standards of quality, The Guild also hosts programs and competitions.
History.
The Guild of Boston Artists, a non-profit art organization, was founded in 1914 to "promote, nurture and encourage traditional art while adhering to the highest standards of quality and presentation." Founding members included Edmund C. Tarbell, William McGregor Paxton, Frank Weston Benson, Bela Pratt, Charles Herbert Woodbury and Ignaz Gaugengigl.
Boston artists found it difficult to have their work exhibited outside of the local area. In response, seven area artists formed The Guild of Boston Artists. Modeled after the historic guilds of Europe, the organization held high professional standards in a supportive environment. In their Newberry Gallery, annual shows of works of all members were interspersed with two-week one-man shows that highlighted the work of individual artists.
In 1916 the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston temporarily put paintings from two of their galleries into storage to make room for a one-month exhibition of works of "some of the best work being done in Boston" by Guild members. Previously unsuccessful in garnering enough work of Boston artists for an exhibition, the museum was pleased both with the quality of works made available for the exhibition and the inclusiveness of Guild membership. 
Works of early women members of the guild, including Laura Coombs Hills, Lillian Hale, Alice Sohier, Lucy May Stanton, Mary Foote Hawley, Elizabeth Paxton and Agnes Abbott, were exhibited in the 2001 retrospective show "A Woman's Perspective: Founding and Early Women Members of the Guild of Boston Artists, 1914-1945."
Guild presidents.
The presidents of the Guild include:
Membership.
Over 60 artists from New England are currently represented by the gallery, covering a wide range of mediums and genres.
There are currently three forms of membership: Associate, Student and Patron memberships. Members are provided the opportunity to receive a discount for Guild classes workshops, and critiques and invitations to private events and special previews. Associate and student members are also able to submit work for juried exhibitions and are exempt from fees for selected juried exhibitions.
Exhibitions and programs.
Each year The Guild hosts painting exhibitions of its members. Ongoing displays of varying genres and mediums are displayed in the upper gallery. The President's Gallery is used for one-person shows and themed exhibits. The Guild offers educational programs for its artists, including classes, workshops, lectures and critiques. Juried competitions for Guild members are held in April and non-members in October each year.
The Guild's building is located at 162 Newberry Street in the gallery district of Boston.

Glen Sheil

Glenister Fermoy (Glen) Sheil (21 October 192929 September 2008) was an Australian politician, representing the National Party in the Senate for the state of Queensland from 1974 to 1981, and again from 1984 to 1990.
Biography.
Glen Sheil was born in Sydney and moved to Queensland at a young age. He attended The Southport School on the Gold Coast and studied medicine at the University of Queensland, after which he was a medical practitioner. He also owned the Dungarvan Private Hospital in Brisbane.
He was elected to the Senate at the 1974 election, taking his seat immediately on 18 May because the election followed a double dissolution. In an early parliamentary speech, he read the Lord's Prayer in nine South African languages. He was re-elected in 1975. 
After the 1977 election, Malcolm Fraser announced the make-up of the new ministry that he would be recommending to the Governor-General. Sheil was to be Minister for Veterans' Affairs. This announcement was made at 5 p.m. on 19 December 1977. On 20 December he was sworn as a member of the Federal Executive Council, a constitutional pre-requisite for appointment as a minister. That same day, in an interview on ABC Radio, he professed his support for the South African apartheid system, which was very much at odds with the Fraser government’s position. Fraser decided not to proceed with Sheil's appointment to the ministry. In a very rare move, he advised the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, to terminate Sheil's appointment as an Executive Councillor (such appointments are normally for life). Cowen was required by convention to act on the Prime Minister's advice, and the termination occurred at midday on 21 December. 
This was widely described as "the shortest ministerial career in Australia's history". In fact, Sheil was never a minister at all, but he was a member of the Executive Council for two days, during which time he was entitled to be known as "Senator the Hon Glenister Sheil".
On 6 February 1981 he resigned from the Senate to contest a by-election for the House of Representatives seat of McPherson; he was defeated by Liberal Party candidate Peter White. The casual vacancy caused by his resignation was filled by Florence Bjelke-Petersen, the wife of the then Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen.
At the 1984 election on 1 December, he was re-elected to the Senate, again taking his seat immediately because the Senate was being increased from 64 to 76 members. He was defeated at the 1990 election, his term expiring on 30 June 1990.
Glen Sheil led the delegation of Queenslanders For a Constitutional Monarchy at the 1998 Constitutional Convention. He was also active in tennis, rugby and cricket in Queensland.
He was known as "Thumpa", a nickname from a rabbit-farming company he part-owned.
He died in 2008.

<doc id="19645392" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19645392" title="Marblehead Little Theatre">
Marblehead Little Theatre

The Marblehead Little Theatre is a community theatre in Marblehead, Massachusetts, founded in 1956. 
It is one of the oldest continually operating community theatres in the United States.
History.
The Beginning.
One success in 1955 by members of the drama committee of the Marblehead Woman's Club, ignited the desire to tackle bigger and better things.
Encouraged by the response to a one act play, "The Charm Racquet", the women decided to next produce a three-act play and then went one step bolder by deciding to form a community theatre group.
Marblehead Little Theatre's first full scale production was Moss Hart's "Light up the Sky". While casting the show, it became evident that a much larger group was needed and so, husbands, sons, daughters, and friends were enlisted. The show opened on January 18, 1956, at the Marblehead Junior High School Auditorium.
And so Marblehead Little Theatre (MLT) was born and now over five decades later has proven to be one of the oldest community theatre groups in New England as well as one of the few to have continually produced shows each year.
Throughout the fifties, MLT held its main productions at the High School using the proscenium stage. As the group gained recognition, they were asked to perform at churches, charity functions, and veteran's hospitals and began including a number of one act plays suitable for these occasions. MLT has also performed "Leonardo da Vinci" as a children's presentation at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
The 60's.
By the sixties, MLT was not only doing workshops such as "J.B." and "The Lady's Not For Burning", but they also ventured into the new theatre of the absurd with. "Zoo Story" and "The Bald Soprano". In 1963, MLT was invited to participate in the Marblehead Arts Festival, performing two one act plays on an outdoor stage.
A big leap was made in the mid sixties by the decision to take the plunge and do a musical. They got their feet wet by presenting "The Fantasticks" with a cast of seven, minimal scenery and an orchestra consisting of a pianist, a harpist, and a percussionist. The show received such an enthusiastic reception that they were inspired to stage a full scale musical "Pajama Game" in November 1965. The cast of forty came from all over the North Shore with membership drawn from Salem, Swampscott, Peabody, Danvers, Beverly and Hamilton. This was a big production with 18 musical numbers, singing and dancing, many set changes and most of all, a full orchestra which was presented at Salem State College's large auditorium and was a sell-out.
Since then, MLT has presented at least one musical production each year which has become the hallmark of the group. The sixties also saw MLT's entrance into the New England Theatre Conference Annual Community Theatre Drama Festival competition. During the sixties MLT began awarding an annual scholarship to a member of the Marblehead High School graduating class who has participated in theatrical productions during high school as well as contributed in some way to Marblehead Little Theatre.
The 70's.
In 1970, MLT revived "The Fantasticks" and became a traveling group taking the show to Beverly for a benefit performance for the North Shore Community College. They also toured Endicott College, Arlington, Concord, and the Essex Agricultural and Technical Institute in Danvers.
Historic Abbot Hall became the setting for many musicals produced in the seventies with the initial staging of "Kiss Me Kate" followed with superb performances of "Man of La Mancha", "Fiddler on the Roof", "Brigadoon", "Camelot", as well as productions for children of "The Red Shoes" and "Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp".
Perhaps the most memorable performance of the seventies at Abbot Hall was opening night of the Bicentennial show of "1776". There were parties before and after the performance hosted by the Marblehead Bicentennial Commission in the Selectman's Meeting Room with the original Willard painting of the "Spirit of ’76" as a most appropriate and inspiring backdrop. 
The 80's.
In the eighties, MLT began staging their productions at the new Nelson Aldrich Performing Arts Center at the Marblehead High School with a seating capacity of 766 and a stage to rival the best of Boston's professional theater. The professionalism and quality of the two major musicals staged yearly greatly enhanced the growing reputation of MLT as a high caliber community theatre. Audiences flocked to see such productions as "The Music Man", "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum", and "Company".
The 90's.
During the nineties, MLT's major project has been obtaining a home of their own to stage small productions, conduct workshops, and provide space to store and build sets, to rehearse, as well as store props and costumes. 
The desire to do smaller plays in addition to our yearly big musicals resulted in the production of an original play "One Civilized Person" in 1995 as a part of the Marblehead Festival of Arts and later, productions of "Exit the Body", "The Cemetery Club" and "Bullshot Crummond" all staged at the Tower School in Marblehead.
1998's major production of "The Wizard of Oz" staged at the Aldrich Center played to sold out audiences.
During the production of "The King and I" in the Fall of 1999, the Marblehead Board of Selectmen awarded the School Street Firehouse to Marblehead Little Theatre.

<doc id="19645455" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19645455" title="Die Spinne">
Die Spinne

Die Spinne, translated as The Spider, is believed by some to be a secret organization established and led in part by Otto Skorzeny, Hitler's commando chief, as well as Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen which helped as many as 600 former SS men escape from Germany to Spain, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia and other countries. 
Die Spinne was established by Skorzeny using the cover names of Robert Steinbacher and Otto Steinbauer, and supported by either Nazi funds or, according to some sources, Austrian Intelligence. Later, Skorzeny, Gehlen and their network of collaborators had gained significant influence in parts of Europe and Latin America. Skorzeny travelled between Francoist Spain and Argentina, where he acted as an advisor to President Juan Perón and bodyguard of Eva Perón, while fostering an ambition for the "Fourth Reich" centred in Latin America.
According to Infield, the idea for the Die Spinne network began in 1944 as Hitler's chief intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen foresaw a possible downfall of the Third Reich due to Nazi military failures in Russia. T.H. Tetens, expert on German geopolitics and member of the US War Crimes Commission in 1946-1947, referred to a group overlapping with die Spinne as the Führungsring "a kind of political Mafia, with headquarters in Madrid... serving various purposes." The Madrid office built up what was referred to as a sort of Fascist International, per Tetens. According to Tetens the German leadership also included Dr. Hans Globke, who had written the official commentary on the Nuremberg Laws. Globke held the important position of Director of the German Chancellery from 1953 until 1963, serving as adviser for Konrad Adenauer, 
The "Fascist International".
During the period from 1945 to 1950, Die Spinne leader Skorzeny facilitated the escape of Nazi war criminals from war-criminal prisons to Memmingen, Bavaria, through Austria and Switzerland into Italy. Certain US military authorities supposedly knew of the escape, but took no action. 
The Central European headquarters of Die Spinne as of 1948 was in Gmunden, Austria. 
A coordinating office for international Die Spinne operations in Madrid, Spain, by Otto Skorzeny, under the control of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, whose victory in the Spanish Civil War was guaranteed by economic and military support from Hitler and Mussolini. When a Die Spinne Nazi delegation visited Madrid in 1959, Franco stated, "Please regard Spain as your second Fatherland." 
Skorzeny used the resources of Die Spinne to allow Nazi concentration camp doctor Joseph Mengele to escape to Argentina in 1949. 
Die Spinne leader Skorzeny requested the assistance of ultra-wealthy German industrialist Alfried Krupp, whose company controlled 138 private concentration camps under the Third Reich, and this was granted in 1951. Skorzeny became Krupp's representative in industrial business ventures in Argentina, a country harboured a strong pro-Nazi political element throughout World War II and afterwards, regardless of a nominal declaration of loyalty to the Allies as World War II ended.
With the help of Die Spinne leaders in Spain, by the early 1980s Die Spinne had become influential inArgentina, Chile and Paraguay, including ties involving Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner. 
War Crimes investigator Simon Wiesenthal claimed that Joseph Mengele had stayed at the notorious Colonia Dignidad Nazi colony in Chile in 1979, and ultimately was harboured in Paraguay until his death.
As of the early 1980s, Die Spinne's Mengele was reported by Infield to have been advising Stroessner's ethnic German Paraguayan police on how to reduce native Paraguayan Indians in the Chaco Region to slave labour. 
A wealthy and powerful post-World-War-II underground Nazi political contingent held sway in Argentina as of the late 1960s, which included many ethnic German Nazi immigrants and their descendants. 
In popular culture.
The Die Spinne network in Spain is the focus of the 1966 Nick Carter spy novel Web of Spies

The Third Option

The Third Option is Vince Flynn's third novel, and the second to feature Mitch Rapp, an American agent that works for the CIA as an operative for a covert counterterrorism unit called the "Orion Team."
Plot summary.
Mitch Rapp is sent on a highly sensitive mission in northern Germany to assassinate Count Heinrich Hagenmiller V, a powerful arms dealer that has been selling weapons to Saddam Hussein and other enemies of the United States. Rapp successfully slays Hagenmiller, only to be betrayed by his mission companions "Jane and Tom Hoffman", who attempt to kill Rapp by shooting him twice in the chest, not knowing his jacket was lined with kevlar which absorbed the rounds and knocked him down. Jane (the one that shot him) quickly stages the scene to implicate Rapp and then flees the location with Tom. A shocked Rapp eventually awakes. As a result of his fall, a gash in his head has left a small pool of his blood on the floor. Not wanting to leave the forensic evidence behind, he sets the room on fire and quickly escapes. 
Back in Washington D.C., the situation in Germany quickly becomes known to politicians and officials, with a few trying to use the situation to their own advantage. Democratic Congressman Albert Rudin is not fooled by the CIA's denial of involvement, and argues that it is further proof that the CIA is bad for America and the world, and should be shut down. Henry "Hank" Clark, who is a corrupt, ambitious, and calculating Republican U.S. senator with his eye on the Presidency, is the one that ordered the hit on Rapp, hoping that his dead body would embarrass President Robert Xavier Hayes, and ruin the career of CTC Director, Dr. Irene Kennedy. Clark, along with Rudin and Secretary of State Charles Middleton, are in an alliance to stop Dr. Kennedy from succeeding the dying Thomas Stansfield as Director. Unbeknownst to Rudin and Middleton, Clark dispatches a group of contract killers led by "Professor" Peter Cameron, to initiate a widespread blood-purge that will eliminate any person that can leave a paper trail back to him. 
Rapp hides in France and gathers his thoughts. He believes it is possible that his boss, Dr. Irene Kennedy, the Director of the Counter Terrorism Center and "friend", ordered the Hoffmans to assassinate him in order to cover the situation up. Rapp eventually returns to Washington and confronts her and her boss, the CIA Director, Thomas Stansfield at his house. Also found in the room was retired SEAL Team Six Commander, Scott Coleman. With gun drawn, Rapp demands answers; after a brief discourse between him and his bosses, Rapp comes to realize that they had nothing to do with the attempt on his life. 
Rapp learns that many of his colleagues are being killed and that his girlfriend Anna Reilly has been kidnapped by the assassins. They kidnapped her in order to set a death trap for Rapp. The Hoffmans, (AKA The Jansens) are assassinated outside their home by Cameron. Rapp, along with Coleman and a few other agents, eventually rescue Anna, killing all of Cameron's men in the process. Cameron, who was talking to one of his men on the phone while the assault was executed, quickly learns that all has failed. Rapp contacts Cameron and pledges to kill him unless he confesses the identity of his employer. Cameron refuses to answer and quickly makes plans to leave the country. However, only moments before Rapp reaches Cameron, he is killed by an Italian assassin named Donatella Rahn, who was hired by Clark. 
The president soon learns about the coup d’état against him, and summons two of the main movers of the conspiracy, Rudin and Middleton. The president lambastes them in two separate meetings for betraying their party. He then demands them to tell him everything they know, so he may find out who ordered the hit on Rapp. Both of the men do not give the president any useful answers. Rudin is left without power within the Democratic Congressional caucus and Middleton is told he will be fired as Secretary of State. Shortly afterward Middleton is found dead in his apartment, ruled a suicide. It was Clark that ordered the hit, but pretends to know now nothing about it, even to his close friend Jonathan Brown, the Deputy Director of the CIA who hates both Stansfield and Dr. Kennedy. Clark announces to a shocked Brown that he is backing Dr. Kennedy's nomination, but assures him that Kennedy "will never make it through the confirmation process."

The Brilliant Mistakes

The Brilliant Mistakes is an American rock band based in New York City known for their eclectic mix of pop, rock, folk and soul styles. The critically acclaimed group was formed in 1994 by singer-songwriters Alan Walker, a New Yorker, and Erik Philbrook, a transplant from Bangor, Maine, who met while working together at Penguin Books in Manhattan. The band’s moniker comes from a song on Elvis Costello’s "King of America" album. Other original members of the group included drummer Mickey Wood and guitarist Andy Resnick. Drummer Paul Mauceri replaced Wood in 2000. The group also alternated guitarists, including Cameron Greider, John Putnam, Greg Beshers and Keith Tasker, to record and perform. The Brilliant Mistakes have self-released three full-length studio albums and one EP.
Inspiration.
The Brilliant Mistakes have been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including early Elvis Costello and the Attractions, Squeeze, and Crowded House, as well as classic groups like the Beatles, the Byrds, the Beach Boys, the Kinks, and Big Star. Initially considered strictly a power-pop band, The Brilliant Mistakes sound has evolved into a more roots-oriented blend of classic American folk, R&B, and rock styles, with more modern experimental flourishes exemplified by such groups as Wilco, The Jayhawks, the Pernice Brothers, and My Morning Jacket.

Irwinville, Georgia

Irwinville is an unincorporated community in Irwin County, Georgia, United States.
Irwinville was founded as "Irwinsville" in 1831 as seat for the newly formed Irwin County. The community was named for Georgia governor Jared Irwin. It was renamed to Irwinville (without the S) when it was incorporated as a town in 1857. In 1907, the seat of Irwin County was transferred from Irwinville to Ocilla.
It is best known as the site of Jefferson Davis's capture at the end of the Civil War. On May 9, 1865, Jefferson Davis and a small group of officials camped in this pine forest, not knowing that Union cavalry soldiers were in hot pursuit. At dawn they were surrounded by two independent groups of Union cavalry who were unaware of each other’s presence. Gunfire ensued until the federal forces realized they had been shooting at one another. Two Union cavalrymen died during the skirmish. Davis was then taken prisoner. The Jefferson Davis Memorial Historic Site is a Georgia State Park operated by Irwin County.
It was also a part of the Works Progress Administration projects in the thirties. A small water park originally called Crystal Lake (later changed to Crystal Beach) operated just outside of there from the middle of the twentieth century to 1998.

Charles Marlow

Charles Marlow is a recurring character in the work of Polish-born English novelist Joseph Conrad. Marlow is an alter ego of Conrad; both are sailors for the British Empire during the late-19th and early-20th century during the height of British imperialism.
Marlow narrates several of Conrad's best-known works. The character Marlow narrates Conrad's novels "Lord Jim" and "Chance", as well as the framed narrative in "Heart of Darkness", and his short story "Youth". The stories are not told entirely from Marlow's perspective however. There is also an omniscient narrator who introduces Marlow and some of the other characters. Then, once introduced, Marlow proceeds to tell the actual tale, creating a story-within-a-story effect.
In "Heart of Darkness" the omniscient narrator observes that "yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical [...] and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze."
Inspiration.
Marlow's name may be inspired by the Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe. Conrad's father was a translator of William Shakespeare who doubtless would have known of Marlowe's work as well. Some intertextual interpretations of "Heart of Darkness" have suggested that Marlowe's "The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus" may have influenced Conrad. Charles Marlow describes a character as a "papier-mache Mephistopheles", a reference to the Faust legend. Marlow's and Kurtz's journey up the Congo River in "Heart of Darkness" also has similarities to another work by Marlowe, "Dido, Queen of Carthage", in which Aeneas is stranded on the shore of Libya and meets the African queen Dido.

Catherine Share

Catherine Louise "Gypsy" Share (born December 10, 1942) is a former member of Charles Manson's "Family".
Early life.
Share was born in Paris to a Hungarian violinist father and a German mother. Her parents were both members of the French Resistance movement during World War II, and both committed suicide when their daughter was two. Share's maternal grandmother died in a ghetto in Eastern Europe and both of Share's paternal grandparents died in concentration camps. Before her parents' suicides, her father made arrangements with a French lawyer who was secretly helping the underground to plan his daughter's escape.
Through her father's arrangements, Share was adopted by a French woman who later married an American psychologist and they relocated to Hollywood, California. Share graduated from Hollywood High School in 1961. Share's childhood in America was, according to Share, a relatively happy one until her adoptive mother was diagnosed with cancer and committed suicide when Share was 16. Share then lived with her blind adoptive father. After her adoptive father remarried, Share dropped out of college and began wandering California, immersed in the 1960s counterculture.
In 1966 Catherine Share cut a single for the Autumn label in San Francisco who were already riding high with the Beau Brummels. The recording, under the name of Charity Shane, was issued in the UK in the 2000s as a track on the Ace/Big Beat CD "Someone to Love".
Involvement with the Manson Family.
In early 1967, Share met Bobby Beausoleil on the set of a softcore porn movie entitled "Ramrodder". She eventually began an affair with the aspiring musician and, after meeting Charles Manson through Beausoleil, moved to the "Family"'s location on Spahn's Ranch, where the other Family members nicknamed her "Gypsy". She was not directly involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders but would testify at the 1970 trial that Family member Linda Kasabian was the mastermind behind the murders in an effort to absolve Manson of any involvement in the crimes. On September 9, 1971, as Hoyt was preparing to board her flight back to California, Moorehouse bought Hoyt a hamburger and laced it with a multi-dose of LSD then left her and flew back to California. Hoyt survived the attempt on her life and Share and the others were initially charged with attempted murder. The charge was later reduced to conspiracy to dissuade a witness from testifying. Share, Fromme, Rice and Grogan served 90 day sentences at the Los Angeles County Jail. Moorehouse never served her sentence, as she failed to appear at the sentencing hearing.
While incarcerated Share gave birth to a son, Phoenix Son on January 5, 1971. The baby was taken from Share and placed into foster care. For years Share refused to confirm the paternity of her son, although refuting that Manson was the father. After her release from prison, she was reunited with her son and confirmed that Steve "Clem" Grogan was the father.
On August 21, 1971, Share, accompanied by her then-husband Kenneth Como and Family members Mary Brunner, Dennis Rice, Charles Lovett, and Larry Bailey drove a white van to a Hawthorne, California Western Surplus Store. Once inside the store, the group brandished guns and ordered the store patrons and clerks to lie on the ground. They then went about taking 143 rifles from the premises, loading them into their van, while a store clerk managed to trip the silent alarm. According to police officers, the group then began debating whether or not to kill all of those who were in the store.
The group's plan was to hijack a Boeing 747 and threaten to kill one passenger every hour until Manson and fellow Family members were released from prison. When a police squad car arrived, Share opened fire on the vehicle, shattering the windshield. As more squad cars arrived, they were able to block the van from fleeing from the scene by opening fire on the Family. When police finally gained control of the scene and apprehended the group; Brunner, Share and Bailey were injured.
Brunner and Share were convicted of the crime and incarcerated at the California Institution for Women where Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel were serving their sentences for their participation in the Tate/LaBianca murders. Share served five years for her participation in the Hawthorne shootout and was released in 1975. Following her release from prison, Share disassociated herself from the "Family" and sought surgical treatment to remove the "X" she had previously carved into her forehead as a sign of solidarity with other Manson acolytes.
After the Manson Family.
In 1979, Share was convicted "in absentia" in the state of California on six counts of mail fraud, interstate transportation of stolen property, and fraudulent use of a credit card. Share had initially fled to Canada and then returned to the United States to serve out her sentence. In July 2006, Share returned to the remnants of Spahn Ranch to be interviewed about her role in the Manson Family for the series "Our Generation" on The History Channel. In 2007, Share was interviewed about her involvement with the Manson Family by forensic psychologist Dr. Michael Stone for the American television series "Most Evil" on the Investigation Discovery network. Today, Share is a self-proclaimed Christian who has a close relationship with her son and speaks out against cults.

Equation (poem)

"Equation" is one of the popular poems of Tapan Kumar Pradhan, the Indian writer and poet, and it won Kendriya Sahitya Akademi's "Indian Literature" Golden Jubilee Award for Poetry in 2007. The poem received critical acclaim following its publication in the journal "Indian Literature" in December 2007. The theme of the poem is poetic justice or the law of retribution, by which an exploiter or oppressor ultimately is paid back in the same coin. 
Origin of the poem.
The setting of the poem is the drought affected areas of Kalahandi district in Orissa, India, now known as Nuapada, where the poet spent a couple of years in early childhood and adulthood. The poem was first written by him in his mother tongue Oriya in 2001. It was originally titled "Hisaaba", and was subsequently translated by the poet himself into English. The translated poem was submitted to the Sahitya Akademi as entry for the "Indian Literature Golden Jubilee Literary Competition 1957-2002". In the words of the poet, the single event that prompted him to write the poem was ""a news-item published in the daily Samaja in 1992 which described the story of a poor tribal woman who was compelled to sell off her six-months old child for a paltry sum of forty rupees in the face of starvation..."". The English translation is an abridged version of the much longer original Oriya poem.
Allusion and symbolism.
The poem is allegorical in nature and is written in the "story-building" or narrative style with stark symbols and allusion, which is typical of Pradhan's poetry. The poem is in three parts ("From Blood to Tears", "From Tears to Blood", and "Tears in Blood"). The first part describes scenes of poverty, starvation and sexual-economic exploitation of poor illiterate people in Kalahandi symbolically through the story of a woman who sold her only child for forty rupees, and that of a man whose wife went to a far-off place to work, never to return. The second part describes the turning of fortunes for Kalahandi. With the advent of international NGOs, government subsidy and media coverage, Kalahandi now learns how to convert its tears to blood, and sell the blood for money (chops off flesh from its own thighs...). The third part shows how Kalahandi is now ready to take revenge. The exploiter has now to pay the price. He now finds that the blood he sucked is actually full of tears (retaliation in the form of misery and virus). The poem has many hidden layers of meaning, offering food for thought to the discerning reader.
Comments and criticism.
The renowned Oriya short story writer Bhupen Mahapatra has commented that "Equation" along with the poet's other poem "Kalahandi" are peerless in their genre in modern Oriya Literature. However the critic Ramakrishna Mohanty opines that the poem suffers from many structural defects, notably the sudden loss of meter, tempo and focus in the last section after the rather brilliant opening in the first two parts.

Goyescas (opera)

Goyescas is an opera in one act and three tableaux, written in 1915 by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados. Granados composed the opera to a Spanish libretto by Fernando Periquet y Zuaznabar with melodies taken from his 1911 piano suite, which was also called "Goyescas". The opera was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on January 28, 1916.
Performance history.
Prevented by World War I from being presented at the Paris Opéra, the premiere of "Goyescas" took place on January 28, 1916 at the Metropolitan Opera. It was the first opera to be performed there in Spanish. Paired on a double bill with Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci", the opera's cast included the leading artists Giovanni Martinelli and Giuseppe De Luca. The stage production was directed by Jules Speck. It featured sets by the Milanese designer Antonio Rovescalli, and costumes by G. B. Santoni that followed the paintings of Goya.
The opera was well received. In his review for the "New York Times", Richard Aldrich wrote that the music was "profoundly felt" and possessed "an intensely national color". In spite of this success, the short opera has never found a permanent place in the opera repertoire. It has not yet been repeated at the Met following its original five performances. More recently, "Goyescas" was presented in a well-received production at Central City Opera (Colorado) in 2003.
The "Intermezzo" from the opera became a popular independent concert piece. It is performed in arrangements for orchestra, and for cello and piano.
A Spanish film of "Goyescas", adapted from the opera, was made in 1942. It was directed by Benito Perojo and starred Imperio Argentina.
Background.
Granados was inspired to write his popular piano suite by the paintings of Francisco Goya. After the enthusiastic response to the piano work, he was encouraged to compose the opera by Ernest Schelling, an American pianist who premiered the suite in the U.S.
Regarding "Goyescas", the composer wrote, "I am enamored with the psychology of Goya, with his palette, with him, with his muse the Duchess of Alba, with his quarrels with his models, his loves and flatteries. That whitish pink of the cheeks, contrasting with the blend of black velvet; those subterranean creatures, hands of mother-of-pearl and jasmine resting on jet trinkets, have possessed me."
As noted above the opera was not written as an entirely new work. The opera was based on themes from the famous piano suite, which he orchestrated and augmented to form a three-scene work. The libretto had to be fitted to existing melodies, the reverse of the usual way of writing an opera. Though the opera is rarely performed, the piano suite forms part of the standard Romantic piano repertoire.
The success of the Met premiere of "Goyescas" led indirectly to Granados's death. He was invited by President Woodrow Wilson to perform a piano recital at the White House, causing him to postpone his return to Spain. Granados and his wife lost their lives on March 24, 1916 when their ship, the French steamer "Sussex", was torpedoed by a German U-boat in the English Channel.
Synopsis.
The story of "Goyescas" is based on a series of six paintings from Francisco Goya’s early career, inspired by the stereotypical young men and women of the majismo movement. These majos and majas are known for their bohemian attitude and soft spot for finery. The opening scene is directly based on his 1791 painting ‘El Pelele’, painted for Charles IV of Spain to hang in his textile mill, although the painting implies a satire of the monarch’s popularity.
First Tableau.
The majos and majas are enjoying an afternoon outside the Church of San Antonio de la Florida. As the Manzanares River meanders in the distance, the fun loving troupe spend their time dancing, feasting, and playing a traditional game known as the pelele. This game involves a human replication made of straw being thrown up in the air by a group using a stretched out sheet. As they flirt and chatter, Paquito enters, surrounded by women. He calls all the ladies unique garden flowers, and they swoon for him, but all of them know who he supposedly belongs to. Pepa enters the scene riding her dog cart, and the men crowd around her excitedly, as she thanks them for making her feel welcome.
Suddenly, the attention is on two richly dressed lackeys bearing a sedan-chair, and in which the high born lady Rosario waits for her lover. Paquito wastes no time approaching this mystery woman. He recalls a time when she appeared at one of their lantern-lit balls, and invites her again that very night. Rosario ignores him, but her indifference goes unnoticed by Fernando, captain of the royal guard, who was hiding away and spying on her and Paquito. Fernando assumes that she was flirting, and although she flatly denies it, he does not trust her. They continue arguing while Pepa and the ladies mock them. Fernando decides that Rosario will accept the invitation, but that he will accompany her. They leave promptly, and after sharing their plans to ruin the lovers, Pepa and Paquito leave on their dog cart.
Second Tableau.
At the ball that night, all the majas are dancing, while the majos watch eagerly. Fernando enters dragging Rosario, whom Pepa proceeds to make fun of the minute she walks through the door. Fernando assures Rosario that he will defend her honor. Upon this, Paquito makes a spectacle of asking Rosario to dance, and Pepa questions his motives jealously. Fernando insults Paquito honor, while Rosario protests. Paquito suggests a duel to prove his valor. A brawl begins, the women holding back Paquito and the men from rushing Fernando, and Rosario faints in the excitement. After setting the time and place of the duel, Fernando leaves with Rosario. Pepa, returning to the center of attention, engages the crowd in a fandango.
Third Tableau.
Later that night, Rosario sits on a bench in the palace garden, listening to the sad song of a nightingale under the light of the moon. As she moves to go inside, Fernando approaches the house, calling to her. She responds sorrowfully, but always lovingly, and he doubts her claims of total devotion. They share a loving moment, ruined by the presence of Paquito, who is dressed in a black cloak with Pepa trailing furtively. Fernando makes ready to leave, and Rosario clings to him, begging him to stay. Fernando tears himself away, promising to return victorious, and leaves. Rosario follows, and the duel begins.
Two screams signal the end of the duel, one by Fernando being mortally wounded, the other by Rosario. Paquiro flees, dragging his cloak behind him. Rosario drags the mortally wounded Fernando to the bench where they had just shared their tender moment. She holds him against her bosom, and they share one last kiss before he dies in her arms.
Notable references in other pieces of art.
Mexican songwriter Consuelo Velázquez based her 1940 song "Bésame Mucho" on the melody of the "Aria of the Nightingale" from the third tableau.

<doc id="19645952" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19645952" title="Wildcat formation">
Wildcat formation

Wildcat formation describes a formation for the offense in gridiron football in which the ball is snapped not to the quarterback but directly to a running back. The Wildcat features an unbalanced offensive line and looks to the defense like a sweep behind zone blocking. A player moves across the formation prior to the snap. However, once this player crosses the position of the running back who will receive the snap, the play develops unlike the sweep.
Defending against the Wildcat is straightforward, but the defense does not always identify that a play will use the Wildcat, and preparing to defend against it may take practice time away from other preparation. If a defense interprets the Wildcat as a regular sweep play to one side, it may reduce its defense of the weak side and make it easier for the running back to advance the ball by running to that side.
The Wildcat is a gambit rather than an overall offensive philosophy. It can be a part of many offenses. For example, a spread-option offense might use the Wildcat formation to keep the defense guessing, or a West Coast offense may use the power-I formation to threaten a powerful run attack.
The Wildcat scheme was invented by Billy Ford and Ryan Wilson, and was originally called the "Dual" formation. It has been used since the late 1990s at every level of the game, including the CFL, NFL, NCAA, NAIA, and many high schools across North America. Specific coaching staffs have used it with various innovations and have given their versions a variety of names.
History.
One possible precursor to the wildcat formation was named the "wing-T", and is widely credited to being first implemented by Coach Tubby Raymond and Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team. Tubby Raymond later wrote a book on the innovative formation. The wildcat's similarity to the wing-T is the focus on series football, where the initial movements of every play look similar. For example, the wing-T makes use of motion across the formation as well in order to draw a reaction from the defense, but runs several different plays from the same look.
Another possible precursor to the wildcat is the offense of Six-Man Football, a form of high school football, played mostly in rural West Texas and Montana, that was developed in 1934. In six-man, the person who receives the snap may not run the ball past the line of scrimmage. To bypass this limitation, teams often snap the ball to a receiver, who then tosses the ball to the potential passer. The passer may then throw the ball to a receiver or run with the ball himself.
The virtue of having a running back take the snap in the wildcat formation is that the rushing play is 11-on-11, although different variations have the running back hand off or throw the football. In a standard football formation, when the quarterback stands watching, the offense operates 10-on-11 basis. The motion also presents the defense with an immediate threat to the outside that it must respect no matter what the offense decides to do with the football.
High school.
"The Wall Street Journal" credited Hugh Wyatt, a longtime coach in the Pacific Northwest, with naming the offense. Wyatt, coaching the La Center (WA) High School Wildcats, published an article in "Scholastic Coach and Athletic Director" magazine in 1998, where he explained his version of the offense, which relied on two wing backs and two backfield players directly behind the center alternating who would receive the snap. Many other high school football programs across the United States adopted Wyatt's Wildcat offense.
College.
The wildcat was popularized on the college level by Bill Snyder, head coach of the Kansas State University Wildcats with Michael Bishop as quarterback in 1997 and 1998 when they made a run at the top of the national rankings. Bishop rushed for 1304 career yards in two seasons, including 748 yards on 177 carries during the '98 season. As stated in the previous article, this type of offense was the catalyst for Urban Meyer's offense during the start of his career. It was Meyer's success with quarterback Tim Tebow that helped the formation come to the forefront. 
The wildcat has been continued by current Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn, and former Ole Miss Rebels offensive coordinator David Lee when they were offensive coordinators for the Arkansas Razorbacks after seeing the success of Bill Snyder and Urban Meyer. In 2006, Malzahn was the offensive coordinator for the Razorbacks. Malzahn introduced the wildcat into the Arkansas offense. When Malzahn left for Tulsa in 2007, Lee became the offensive coordinator for the Razorbacks. Both Malzahn and Lee ran a variation of the wildcat formation which prominently featured running backs Darren McFadden and Felix Jones. The wildcat formation was sometimes called the "wildhog" (in honor of the Razorback mascot at the University of Arkansas) and subsequently rebranded as the "Wild Rebel" when Arkansas head coach Houston Nutt went to Ole Miss as head coach (Ole Miss' mascot being the Rebels), and a variation involving a direct snap to a tight end has also been called the "Wild Turkey" popularized by the Virginia Tech Hokies.
Several other college teams have used the wildcat formation regularly, including the wildcats of Kansas State, Kentucky, and Villanova, as well as the Pitt Panthers. Pitt had great success with the formation having star running back LeSean McCoy or running back LaRod Stephens-Howling take the snap. The Panthers scored numerous times from this formation during those years. Kentucky has successfully run the formation with wide receiver Randall Cobb taking the snaps. This formation is frequently called the "WildCobb" and is often very successful given the fact that Cobb also started numerous games at quarterback for Kentucky during his first year. Villanova won the 2009 FCS championship with a multiple offense that included the wildcat, with wide receiver Matt Szczur taking the snap. Szczur scored a key touchdown in the Wildcats' semifinal against William & Mary out of the formation, and made a number of big plays out of the wildcat against Montana in the final.
UCF also uses a wildcat formation they call the "Wild Knight". It was originally intended to be run by Rob Calabrese, even after he lost the starting job in 2010 to Jeff Godfrey, but he tore his ACL using the play to score a rushing touchdown against Marshall on October 13, 2010. At the time, most agreed that Calabrese was effective at running the Wild Knight formation.
National Football League.
The wildcat formation made an appearance in 1998, when Minnesota Vikings' offensive coordinator Brian Billick began employing formations where QB Randall Cunningham lined-up as a wide receiver and third-down specialist David Palmer took the direct snap from the center with the option to pass or run. 
In the 1998 NFC Championship, with 7:58 to go in the third quarter, on a second and 5 play, the Atlanta Falcons deployed quarterback Chris Chandler wide left as a receiver while receiver Tim Dwight took a direct snap and ran 20 yards for a first down.
In a December 24, 2006 game between the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons, the Panthers deployed a formation without a quarterback and snapped the ball directly to running back DeAngelo Williams for much of the game. The Panthers ran the ball—mostly in this formation—for the first twelve plays of the opening drive, and ran the ball 52 times, with only 7 passing plays. The offensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers at the time, Dan Henning, later developed this concept into the wildcat as the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins.
Relying on the experience of quarterbacks coach David Lee who had run the scheme at Arkansas, the 2008 Miami Dolphins under Henning implemented the wildcat offense beginning in the third game of the 2008 season with great success, instigating a wider trend throughout the NFL. The Dolphins started the wildcat trend in the NFL lining up either running back Ronnie Brown (in most cases) or Ricky Williams to take a shotgun snap with the option of handing off, running, or throwing. Through eleven games, the wildcat averaged over seven yards per play for the Dolphins. "It could be the single wing, it could be the Delaware split buck business that they used to do," Dolphins offensive coordinator Dan Henning said. "It comes from all of that." On September 21, 2008, the Miami Dolphins used the wildcat offense against the New England Patriots on six plays, which produced 5 touchdowns (four rushing and one passing—from Ronnie Brown himself) in a 38–13 upset victory.
As the popularity of the wildcat spread during the 2008 NFL season, several teams began instituting it as a part of their playbook.
Defending plays from the wildcat requires linemen and linebackers to know and execute their own assignments without over-pursuing what may turn into a fake or a reverse. The formation's initial success in 2008 can be attributed in part to surprise—defenses had not practiced their countermeasures against such an unusual offensive strategy. Since then, most teams are well prepared to stop the wildcat; an example came in November 2008 when the Patriots traveled to Miami nine weeks after the Dolphins win in Foxboro; Bill Belichick's defense limited the wildcat to just 27 yards and forced the Dolphins to try a conventional passing attack; the game lead changed six times but the Patriots wore out the Dolphins with a 48–28 win.
Though defenses now understand how to stop the wildcat, it does not mean the formation is no longer useful. A defense's practice time is finite. Opponents who prepare to stop the wildcat have less time available to prepare for other offensive approaches. Many teams admit to spending an inordinate amount of time having to prepare for this scheme.
Other teams that use the wildcat formation in the NFL may use different names for their versions. For example, the Carolina Panthers call their version the 'Mountaineer formation', named after the Appalachian State Mountaineers, the alma mater of their wildcat quarterback Armanti Edwards, who played quarterback for the Mountaineers. The Denver Broncos utilize 'Wild Horses', developed in 2009. The New York Jets referred to their version as the Tigercat formation in reference to Brad Smith having attended the University of Missouri when Smith played for New York from 2009–2010. The 2011 Minnesota Vikings referred to their formation as the "Blazer package" which employed former UAB Blazers quarterback Joe Webb.
Canadian Football League.
Until the 2009 season, a technicality in the league rules made the wildcat offense illegal; essentially, the rule stated that a designated quarterback must be in position to take all snaps. This has since been changed.

Chelsea, Dutchess County, New York

Chelsea is a hamlet of the Town of Wappinger in Dutchess County, New York, United States. It is located on the Hudson River in the southwestern corner of the town. It takes the ZIP Code 12512 and is in the 845 telephone area code, and has its own fire district.
It is a small community, primarily residential. A marina is located on the river. Just north of the hamlet is a large pumping station used by the New York City water supply system during droughts to take water directly from the river, since the hamlet is located around the point where the river water becomes fresh enough to drink even in the dryest of times.
History.
The hamlet of Chelsea was originally known as Low Point (to distinguish it from the next hamlet north on the east bank of the river, once known as High Point, now New Hamburg). The hamlet was called Low Point until the completion of the Hudson River Railroad. At that time it was named Carthage. However as mail was being misdirected to another Carthage in Jefferson County, it was renamed Carthage Landing. In 1901, when the railroad built a new station, the name became Chelsea.
Carthage Landing had at one time a shipyard owned by Cornelius Carman, where sloops and steamboats were launched, but it could not withstand the competition with Fishkill Landing after John Peter DeWint completed the Long Dock about 1815, with facilities for the shipment of produce from the back country. Carman introduce the first centerboard on the sloop "Freedom". In 1828 he built the "Plow Boy", a steam ferry-boat, for Carpenter and De Windt of Fishkill Landing. It was the first steam ferry to ply between Fishkill Landing and Newburgh. Between 1868 and 1888 Low Point could boast of eight sloops and schooners, including the "Fancy", the "Henrietta Collyer", the "Lydia White", and the "Matteawan". Capt. John Pinckney was captain of the schooner "Iron Age" running from the Manhattan Iron Works. Captain Charles P. Adriance, Solomon P. Hopkins, and Gilbert S. Hopkins conducted a freighting business from Low Point until 1856.
When the Hudson River Railroad was built, the shipping of goods by water from Low Point fell off.
A post office at Low Point was established about 1840.
St. Mark's Episcopal Church was founded in 1865 by John A. Taplin and thirteen other residents of Carthage Landing, now known as Chelsea, in the Town of Wappinger. In June, 1869 the Rt. Rev. Horatio Potter, Bishop of New York dedicated the new church building. It is in the style of "Carpenter Gothic". The board and batten construction, according to Dutchess County historians, exemplifies "Upjohn inspired parish churches built from Gothic Revival pattern books."
A yacht club was organized in the late 1881 for the purpose of ice yachting.
The Chelsea Fire Company located in the Town of Wappinger was formed on April 1, 1946. The area was considered “no mans land” as far as fire protection since no other community company covered the area. A group of concerned citizens decided to do something about the situation. It was voted to form a “fire company”. Rather than wait to secure a bond to fund an equipment purchase, a group of nineteen men decided to put up $1,800 out of their own pockets for a war surplus fire truck. Thus, the company acquired their first piece of equipment, a 1943 Ford Pumper with a 200 gallon tank. Today, the Chelsea Fire District covers properties in the Town of Wappinger and the Town of Fishkill of about 8 square miles, including a portion of the Hudson River. The fire district includes Stony Kill Farm, an 800 acre state farm and education center, and Dutchess Stadium a minor league baseball stadium home to the Hudson Valley Renegades.
Chelsea is currently the home to the Chelsea Yacht Club, two historic churches, a post office, and several national historic register named homes. The town historians of the Town of Wappinger are Brenda Von Burg and Joey Cavaccini
Historic buildings.
The former Chelsea Grammar School is located on Liberty Street. The first public schoolhouse in the Town of Wappinger, it housed children up until high school. It is an intact one-room schoolhouse from the late 19th century, when the hamlet was a thriving Hudson River port. In 1987 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Its use as a school ended in the mid-20th century when the smaller local school districts of the area were consolidated into the Wappinger Central School District. Since then, the local fire department has used half of it as a community center, and the United States Postal Service has leased the other half for use as the local post office, serving the 12512 ZIP Code.
The Captain Moses W. Collyer House, aka "Driftwood", is located on River Road South in Chelsea, New York, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Moses Collyer was a riverboat captain on the nearby Hudson, from 1899 until his death on September 22, 1942. He cowrote "The Sloops of the Hudson", a memoir and history of the years when sailboats were the primary means of getting up and down the river. An exhaustive and complete work that drew on Collyer's background in a riverfaring family, it is today considered the definitive history of that era and its boats.

Asaf Avidan

Asaf Avidan (; born March 23, 1980) is an Israeli singer-songwriter and musician. He is also the creative force and front-man of Asaf Avidan & the Mojos, an Israeli folk rock band that he established in 2006 in Jerusalem. The band released three albums, "The Reckoning" in 2008, "Poor Boy / Lucky Man" in 2009 and "Through the Gale" in 2010.
Asaf Avidan also had an international hit with "One Day / Reckoning Song (Wankelmut Rmx)".
Starting in 2012, the Mojos band project was shelved so that Avidan would concentrate on a solo career. In 2012, he released "Avidan in a Box", an acoustic live album which covers older songs by him, digital copies only. He also launched his solo studio album "Different Pulses" in Israel, to be made available internationally in 2013.
Biography and early career.
Avidan was born in Jerusalem in 1980. His parents were diplomats for the Israeli Foreign Office, and he spent four years of his childhood in Jamaica.
After the mandatory army service in Israel, Avidan studied animation at Jerusalem’s Bezalel Academy of Arts & Design. His final project short film, “Find Love Now”, won its category at the Haifa Film Festival that year.
After his studies, Avidan moved to Tel Aviv and worked as an animator, until a breakup with his long-time girlfriend shook his world and made him move back to Jerusalem, quit his job and turn full-time to his up-till-then hobby – music. Six songs about that breakup and subsequent heartache would constitute his debut EP, "Now That You're Leaving", which was released independently in 2006 to critical acclaim.
Asaf Avidan & the Mojos.
In late 2006, while playing solo acoustic tour across Israel,
Avidan put together a support cast of musicians who would become the Mojos
(Ran Nir – bass, Yoni Sheleg – drums, Roi Peled – guitar, Hadas Kleinman – cello). The group became very famous in Israel, playing extensively there, and even got out to a tour in New York City in 2007. Here, they also took part to MEANY Fest, advancing to the finals.
The band has released three albums: "The Reckoning" in 2008, "Poor Boy / Lucky Man" in 2009 and "Through the Gale" in 2010.
"The Reckoning" (2008).
In 2007, Asaf Avidan & the Mojos went into the recording studio together for the first time, and recorded "The Reckoning". The album’s 15 tracks blended rock, folk and blues with Avidan’s lyrics about relationships and betrayal.
By now the band had accumulated a huge live following in Israel and most record labels expressed interest. But Avidan decided to continue on the independent path, and founded (with his brother and manager, Roie Avidan) Telmavar Records, on which "The Reckoning" was released in March 2008.
It reached gold status in a year, platinum later, and would become the biggest selling independent record of all time in Israel. It was chosen as Album of the Year (2008) by various media, including "Time Out Tel Aviv".
"Weak", the second single of the album, became a huge radio hit and its video was Video of the Year on Israel’s music channel. "Weak" would also be the title song of the film "L'Arbre" (English title "The Tree") by Julie Bertuccelli, which starred Charlotte Gainsbourg and was the closing film at Cannes Film Festival 2010.
While several European labels put offers on the table, the band opted to embark on a self-funded summer tour in 2009, playing dozens of festivals and venues across Europe. By the end of that summer, Telmavar Records signed a licensing deal with Sony-Columbia in Europe, for "The Reckoning" and for the band's future second LP.
"The Reckoning" was released in parts of Europe in 2009, to generally good reviews.
In 2012 the "Reckoning Song" of the album became popular in Germany by a remix of DJ Wankelmut. It was available on Soundcloud for months before it was released as a proper digital release named "One Day / Reckoning Song (Wankelmut Rmx)". The track charted on sales charts in June 2012 and reached number 1 in August.
"Poor Boy / Lucky Man" (2009).
"Poor Boy / Lucky Man", the band's second album, was released in Israel on 9/9/09. The album's title song and main theme would revolve around a boy born with a hole instead of a heart. The album was originally released in two different names and covers, leaving it up to the audience to decide whether this figure was poor or lucky. It would reach gold status in Israel in 5 months, and garner ecstatic reviews. It was released in parts of Europe in April 2011. Among others, it was album of the month on France's national FIP radio, in the newspaper Libération, and in Germany's Eclipsed magazine.
The band continued to tour non-stop from 2009 all through 2011 (mostly in Israel and Europe but also in the US, Canada, China and India), building up a devoted following and a reputation for a legendary live show. Amongst the hundreds of shows, they played at Brandenburg Gate at The World Championship of Athletics in Berlin; at the closing event at Cannes Film Festival 2010;
at China's biggest May 1 festivals; and at a tribute concert for The Who in Carnegie Hall, New York. They would play dozens of festivals across Europe (including Solidays France, Latitude UK, Paleo Switzerland, Frequency Austria, and Haldern Pop Germany) as well as countless radio and TV shows (including Taratata and One Shot Not in France, and two Rockpalast performances in Germany).
"Through the Gale" (2010).
On November 30, 2010 the band released their 3rd album in Israel, "Through the Gale", a concept album telling the tale of the voyage of a blind and stubborn captain and his loyal crew in search of immortality, to the realms of the gods themselves, only to understand at the end that a voyage with no home, that a life without death, is meaningless.
Solo career.
In July 2011, following another summer tour that saw them sharing the stage with Robert Plant, Ben Harper and Lou Reed among others, Asaf Avidan & the Mojos announced that they are taking an indefinite creative break.
Avidan had continuously played solo and duo acoustic shows throughout the band's career, including "regular" venue shows as well as a TED Global Conference performance, supporting Bob Dylan, playing a tribute concert for The Who at Carnegie Hall and many radio and TV performances.
In 2012, Asaf Avidan announced that he was leaving Sony to join Polydor (Universal Music), and that he was abandoning the Mojos for a solo career. He released the track "Different Pulses" in preparation for a solo international album in 2013 but to be made available in Israel in September 2012.
Prior to his first expected solo album, Avidan toured Israel with a guitar, harmonica and added vocals. The response of the crowds to these intimate, acoustic shows were tremendous. Encouraged by this, Avidan agreed to perform in a series of low key events spread on 48 hours renditions of some of his earlier stuff in a small rented space in south Tel Aviv. The sessions were done with no rehearsals, with just simple guitar accompaniment and in presence of a select few friends attending. His acoustic performances were accordingly recorded without much studio production with the result being the limited release "Avidan in a Box".
On February 13, 2013 Avidan performed a piano vocal version of his hit "Reckoning Song" at the Sanremo Music Festival in Italy.
"Different Pulses" (2012).
"Different Pulses" is the first studio album of Asaf Avidan after the break-up of his band.
"Different Pulses" is also the name of the first single Avidan released from the album, the song had a music video made for it by director Vania Heymann.

What's past is prologue

"What’s past is prologue" is a quotation by William Shakespeare from his play "The Tempest".
Contemporary meaning.
The phrase means that history influences and sets the context for the present. The quotation is engraved on the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C.
Senator Joe Biden used the quotation in the 2008 vice-presidential debate against Sarah Palin when he was accused of focusing too much on the past. The phrase is also commonly used by the military when discussing the similarities between war throughout history.
Historical meaning.
Although the phrase is now commonly used to mean what's stated above, as the phrase was originally used in "The Tempest", Act 2, Scene I, it means that all that has happened before that time, the "past," has led Antonio and Sebastian to this opportunity to do what they are about to do, commit murder. In the context of the preceding and next lines, "(And by that destiny) to perform an act, Whereof what's past is prologue; what to come, In yours and my discharge" Antonio is in essence rationalizing to Sebastian, and the audience, that he and Sebastian are fated to act by all that has led up to that moment, the past has set the stage for their next act, as a prologue does in a play. Therefore, this phrase might be better used in situations where people are attempting to rationalize wicked acts based on the past. It can also be taken to mean that everything up until now has merely set the stage for Antonio and Sebastian to make their own destinies; in this context it does not indicate that their future acts are fated, but rather that everything up to that point was merely like a prologue, not the important story.

Vanvas

Vanvas (, ) is a Sanskrit term meaning residence ("vās") in a forest ("van"). While it can be undertaken voluntarily, it usually carries a connotation of forced exile as a punishment. It commonly figures as a harsh penalty in ancient Hindu epics (such as the Ramayan and Mahabharat) set in a time, thousands of years ago, when much of the Indian subcontinent was a wilderness.
When vanvas is self-imposed, it can imply seclusion from worldly affairs to focus on spiritual matters, as in the case of ashrams (hermitages) established by ancient rishis. When imposed as a punishment, it carries an implication of enforced isolation from society and exposure to life-threatening situations (the elements and wildlife).

<doc id="19646164" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19646164" title="Rudolph Halley">
Rudolph Halley

Rudolph Halley (June 19, 1913–November 19, 1956) was an attorney and politician from New York City.
Early life and career.
Born and raised in Queens, Halley graduated from Townsend Harris High School at age 14, and was forced to wait until age 16 to enroll at Columbia University, from which he graduated with a "Juris Doctor" at age 20. After waiting until his twenty-first birthday to become eligible to pass the bar examination, he went into private practice. During this time, he married and divorced twice. In 1941, he went to work for the U.S. Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, better known as the "Truman Committee" for its chairman, then-Senator Harry S. Truman, which investigated fraud and waste in defense contracting during World War II.
In 1950, Halley was named Chief Counsel to the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce, better known as the Kefauver Committee, which was charged with investigating the influence of organized crime, particularly its involvement in gambling and political corruption. In his role as Chief Counsel, Halley personally questioned every witness called to testify before the Committee. The Committee's hearings, which were televised nationally, made Halley a celebrity. On May 1, 1951, shortly after the Committee concluded its hearings in New York City, Halley announced his resignation. Over the course of the next several months, he translated his celebrity into work in television, narrating the CBS crime drama "Gang Busters" and hosting the documentary program "Crime Syndicated". He also wrote a short-lived column for Hearst Newspapers.
New York City Council.
In the summer of 1951, Halley announced his candidacy for President of the New York City Council, a position that would later be replaced by that of New York City Public Advocate, in a special election held to replace Vincent R. Impellitteri, who had ascended to the mayor's office after the resignation of William O'Dwyer. He ran on an anti-corruption, anti-crime, anti-Tammany Hall platform and promised to "teach the political bosses a lesson." Although a lifelong Democrat, he did not seek the party's nomination, instead running as the nominee of the Liberal Party. He also appeared on the ballot as the nominee of the Fusion Party and the Independent Citizens Party. On Election Day, Halley unexpectedly triumphed, tallying 657,871 votes (39%).
As President of the City Council, Halley was best known for feuding with both Mayor Impellitteri and Governor Thomas E. Dewey over state funding for the City, which was necessary to balance the municipal budget. While Dewey demanded increases in property taxes and the subway fare in return for state aid, Halley favored leaving both taxes and fares alone and instead cutting government waste. Impellitterri opposed both plans. Things turned ugly when Halley accused Dewey of "ruthlessly playing politics" with the budget, and Dewey publicly called Halley "as stupid and ignorant as he is shallow and venomous."
Candidacy for Mayor.
In 1953, Halley declined to run for re-election and instead declared his candidacy for Mayor of New York. Running once again on the Liberal and Independent Citizens lines, he ran third with 467,104 votes (21%), behind Democratic Manhattan Borough President Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and Republican attorney Harold Riegelman. (Halley beat Riegelman for second place in the Bronx and nearly did so in Brooklyn.)
Post-politics.
After the election, Halley retired from politics, becoming a name partner in the law firm of Fulton, Walter & Halley, headquartered at Rockefeller Center. Although there was speculation that he might run for Attorney General of New York in 1954, he never sought office again. On November 19, 1956, Halley died in Manhattan of natural causes at age 43. His death has been attributed to both pneumonia and pancreatitis. He was survived by his wife and four children (Marian, Henry, Peter and Michael).

Finding Rin Tin Tin

Finding Rin Tin Tin is a 2007 Bulgarian–American drama film directed by Israeli filmmaker Danny Lerner.
Plot.
The film tells the story of the original Rin Tin Tin, the legendary German Shepherd, found shortly before the end of World War I by American serviceman Lee Duncan as a shell-shocked puppy in a bombed-out dog kennel in Lorraine, France. The dog was taken to America and became the hero of several films made in the 1920s and 1930s.
Reception.
"Finding Rin Tin Tin" is the lowest ranked film on the French site AlloCiné, compiling the ratings of several film critics and was unanimously ranked 1 star.
Lawsuit.
In October 2008, Daphne Hereford, an American woman breeding progeny of the original Rin Tin Tin, asked a federal court in Houston, Texas to protect her rights to the Rin Tin Tin name. The judge ruled in favor of the filmmakers, declaring the use of the name in the film to be fair use.

Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access

Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) is a channel access method which was designed by Håkan Lans, based on time-division multiplexing.
The term "Self-Organized" describes the manner in which time slots are assigned to users. Time division multiple access (TDMA) divides a channel into frames, which furthermore are subdivided into a vast number of time slots. Users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using his own time slot. One of the drawbacks of TDMA is that it requires a central station for slot assignment and time synchronisation. STDMA proposes a method for assigning slots without the involvement of a central station. Time synchronisation is usually taken care of using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
STDMA is in use by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), a standard marine short range coastal tracking system, and is the base of the International Civil Aviation Organization VHF Data Link Mode 4 .
While the method was patented, a US patent ex-parte reexamination certificate was issued in 2010 canceling all claims.

Fullers Bay of Islands

Fullers GreatSights Bay of Islands is a major tourism company based in Northland, New Zealand. Today it is Northland's largest marine tourism operator with a wide range of cruises and land tours.
History.
In 1886, Albert Ernest Fuller launched the “Undine” sailing ship in the Bay of Islands to deliver coal supplies to the islands within the Bay. With the fitting of a motor in the early 1900s, Fuller was able to deliver the coal and essential supplies to communities as far out as Cape Brett. In 1927 Fuller acquired the “Cream Trip” from Eddie Lane – with the facilities on board to transport cream from the islands, and by the 1960s, the well known ‘Bay Belle’ started this run. Although a modern catamaran now takes this historical route (The Cream Trip), the Bay Belle continues to transport visitors and locals between Paihia and Russell throughout the day. 
In December 2008 Fullers Bay of Islands was rebranded Fullers GreatSights Bay of Islands to bring it inline with InterCity Group's parent sightseeing brand of GreatSights New Zealand.

Anna of Ryazan

Grand Princess Anna Vasilievna of Ryazan () (1451–1501) was a Russian noblewoman, the only daughter of Grand Prince Vasily II of Moscow and the mother and grandmother of last Grand Princes of Ryazan Principality. Anna was born in Moscow to the family of Vasily II of Moscow, who was blinded five years before her birth during a time of troubles, and his wife Maria Yaroslavna of Borovsk.
Before his death in 1456 Grand Prince Ivan Fyodorovich of Ryazan entrusted his friend Vasily of Moscow with temporary governing of the principality and taking care of his children Vasily and Theodosia until their maturity. But soon after Ivan's death Vasily of Moscow moved orphans to Moscow and appointed a voevoda to Ryazan. This decision started a process of joining of Ryazan Principality to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Vasily II's heir Ivan III of Russia continued his father's policy towards Ryazan and Anna grew together with Ryazan prince Vasily.
When Anna grew up her mother has decided to marry Anna and Vasily. She asked her son Ivan III to delay annexation of Ryazan because it was not suitable to a Grand Princess to marry an ordinary nobleman even of princely descent. Ivan III agreed and allowed on Summer 1464 to return sixteen-year Prince Vasily to his family seat. But the same winter he came to Moscow to marry Anna and, after the wedding, the couple returned to Ryazan.
In 1467 Anna bore a son Ivan and until the death of her husband in 1483 did not participate in governing the principality and did not protest when her brother two times annexed Ryazan territories. In 1483 Anna became the regent of her sixteen-year son.
In her policy Anna tried to expand her domain, she visited often Moscow and due her diplomatic efforts the Pronsk principality was added to Ryazan. A major problem in Ryazan-Moscow relations was so-called "ryazan ukraina", a huge steppe region in the basin of Don River. According to treaties, Ryazan was obliged not to settle in these lands, but many years Ryazan princes secretly colonized this area and during the Anna's regency this process become much more significant. Numerous immigrants received considerable privileges, being released for 3–7 years from taxes if agreed to remain in steppe for ever.
Anna's son died in 1500 and until her death in 1501 she was the regent of her grandson Ivan V of Ryazan. After the end of Anna's reign Ryazan Principality finally lost its independence. Except of Ivan, Anna had son Fyodor and daughter Anna who was married to Lithuanian Prince Feodor Ivanovich Belski.

Jackie Robinson Day

Jackie Robinson Day is a traditional event which occurs annually in Major League Baseball, commemorating and honoring the day Jackie Robinson made his major league debut. April 15 was Opening Day in 1947, Robinson's first season in the Major Leagues. Initiated for the first time on April 15, 2004, Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated each year on that day. The festivity is a result of Robinson's memorable career, best known for becoming the first black major league baseball player of the modern era in 1947. His debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers (today known as the Los Angeles Dodgers) ended approximately eighty years of baseball segregation, also known as the baseball color line, or color barrier. He also was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, remembered for his services with the number 42 jersey.
The gala is often celebrated at varied ballparks by Major League team players. Shea Stadium was one of the prominent venues hosting the event, having commemorated the retirement of Robinson's number 42 jersey in . The numbered jersey is still worn to mark the event every year. Bob DuPuy, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Major League baseball, described Jackie Robinson Day as a significance "not only for baseball, but for our country in general."
History.
2004.
The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That day was a start to an annual tradition throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The day would be the first official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 13 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).
"I have often stated that baseball's proudest moment and its most powerful social statement came on April 15, 1947 when Jackie Robinson first set foot on a Major League Baseball field", said Selig. "On that day, Jackie brought down the color barrier and ushered in the era in which baseball became the true national pastime. Fifty years after that historic event, in April 1997, I was
proud to join Rachel Robinson and President Bill Clinton at Shea Stadium to honor Jackie by retiring his uniform number 42 in perpetuity. By establishing April 15 as 'Jackie Robinson Day' throughout Major League Baseball, we are further ensuring that the incredible contributions and sacrifices he made — for baseball and society — will not be forgotten."
It began that Thursday morning with Sharon Robinson, ringing the ceremonial Opening Bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Rachel Robinson (Jackie Robinson's wife), officials from the Major League Baseball foundation, and officials of the Jackie Robinson Foundation (JRF) took part in the special ceremony honoring Jackie Robinson. Festivities took place in the 13 ballparks that had scheduled games that day. The balls had a "42" logo on each of them for the games that day. Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars threw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to each game. "I'm very happy my son is in Boston today, we're happy that the scholars and family are at different clubs and look forward to expanding the celebration as the years go on", Robinson said. "And also continuing to come up with creative ways to reach out to the African-American community and bring them into this wonderful game of baseball that we all love."
2005.
April 15, 2005, was the 58th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially declared that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day and it would be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.
2006.
April 15, 2006, was the 59th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Rachel Robinson attended the ceremony, having former Negro Leagues players Robert Scott and Armando Vazquez also attending the ceremony. His widow was honored and celebrated at Shea Stadium. After a video tribute on the scoreboard of Shea Stadium of Jackie Robinson, Rachel Robinson walked to the pitcher's mound before the New York Mets hosted the Milwaukee Brewers, along with Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, and New York Mets manager Willie Randolph. "I've got a picture of Jackie in my office, so I think about that every day," Randolph said. "I'm just happy to be a part of this day." A large blue, gray and white circle with "42" on it was put over home plate representing the colors of Jackie Robinson's uniform with the Dodgers as a major leaguer.
2007.
April 15, 2007, was the 60th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's major league debut, with ceremonies held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. Uniformed personnel (players, coaches and managers) were invited to wear the number 42 just for that day to commemorate Robinson. During the 2007 regular season, Ken Griffey, Jr. called Bud Selig to ask for permission to wear number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day. Griffey received special permission from Rachel Robinson to wear number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day of 2007.
Number 42 had been retired for every Major League Baseball team. This meant that no future Major League Baseball player could wear it. The number was retired in a ceremony which took place in 1997 at Shea Stadium to mark the 50th anniversary of Robinson's first game with the Dodgers. (The last active player to still retain the Number 42 is Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees, who retired at the end of the 2013 season). Selig embraced the gesture and encouraged other Major League Baseball clubs to have a player wear number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day as well.
Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day was far too many. "This is supposed to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told "USA Today", "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." Cleveland Indians pitcher C.C. Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told "USA Today" that "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. I sure wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the "USA Today". "But I'm not going to look at it as a negative. This is a tribute for what the man has done, a day to celebrate." Garret Anderson, Los Angeles Angels left fielder, told the "USA Today" that he won't wear number 42 because "I just don't feel I'm worthy of it."
Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson, both Baseball Hall of Famers, threw the ceremonial first pitches, and fellow Hall of Famers Joe Morgan and Dave Winfield were on hand. Actors Courtney B. Vance and Marlon Wayans also attended the Jackie Robinson Day ceremony. Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" before the games started. More than 240 players wore number 42 in honor of Jackie Robinson's retired number, including the entire team rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. All scheduled games were played that day except for several games - notably the Washington Nationals-New York Mets, the Houston Astros-Philadelphia Phillies (the game and the ceremony was held on the make-up date on April 23, 2007), as was the Pirates game against the San Francisco Giants; the uniforms were worn at the team's next home game at PNC Park - all due to a major rainstorm in the Eastern United States that postponed six games.
Andre Ethier, Russell Martin and Wilson Valdez managed to each earn three hits each during the Dodgers game. Ethier hit a home run which drove in the first four runs of the season for the Dodgers, who stole five bases — their most since August 23, 1999 when they stole seven in a game at Milwaukee. "It's kind of cool to have a decent game on Jackie Robinson Day," Martin said. "I’m going to remember this probably for the rest of my life." Randy Wolf, who was playing for the Dodgers at the time (currently a free agent) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings and struck out seven. "The whole team wearing No. 42, it kind of goes sour if we don’t win," Wolf said. "It was great. There were a lot of special people here. It's a special day and I think they did it right." The San Diego Padres' José Cruz, Jr. hit his 200th career home run.
Chris Young's streak of 25 consecutive road starts without a loss was broken that day by the Dodgers win. The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. "I was terrible," Young said. "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put the guys in a hole early in the game and it was just too much to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous."
"Oh Happy Day," a Robinson favorite, was sung by The Brookinaires Gospel Choir from The First African Methodist Episcopal Church. Paintings of Minnesota Twins logos acknowledging Robinson were on both sides of the home plate with another behind second base, and "Jackie Robinson Day" was printed on the bases. A video tribute with Morgan and Aaron among those participating was shown. Several current players expressed their thanks to Robinson in the video also.
2008.
April 15, 2008, was the 61st anniversary of Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Over 330 team members wore number 42, more than the over 240 last year. When the teams took the field, all players, managers and coaches were wearing number 42, and was repeated at all other 14 ballparks that had scheduled games that day. All players wore number 42 at games including the Washington Nationals' game at the New York Mets, Pittsburgh's game at the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Angels' game at the Texas Rangers. The Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals and Tampa Bay Rays also wore number 42, increasing the total to nine teams. "The significance of Jackie Robinson Day is not lost on anyone", said Bob DuPuy. "As more and more people realize what April 15 means, not only for baseball, but for our country in general, I think you're going to see the celebration grow annually."
2009.
The celebration for the 2009 season, commemorating the 62nd anniversary of Robinson's debut, included the dedication for the Jackie Robinson Rotunda at Citi Field, the New York Mets' new home in Flushing Meadows prior to the Mets playing the San Diego Padres in the second regular season game to be played there. Additionally, for the first time, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches and umpires) wore #42 for the day. The sole exception was when the scheduled game at Nationals Park between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Washington Nationals was rained out; they wore the jerseys in the night game of a day-night doubleheader May 16.
2010.
The celebration of Jackie Robinson Day, marking the 63rd anniversary of his debut, marked the second season that all uniformed personnel and umpires wearing #42. A total of twelve games were played that day, so as a result, several teams wore Robinson's number in another game in April due to an off day planned for several teams. The main celebration was again in New York, but was held at the new Yankee Stadium, yards from the original stadium where Robinson played in seven World Series against the New York Yankees.
2011.
The 64th anniversary of Robinson's debut marked the third straight season all uniformed players and umpires wearing #42, with the exception of the rained-out New York Mets-Atlanta Braves game; the teams wore the uniforms the following day's makeup game. In addition, a new MLB website, www.iam42.com, was established.
2012.
65th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut and 4th straight season all uniformed players, coaches and umpires wore No. 42.
2014.
The 67th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut will be celebrated at Historic Dodgertown, where Robinson and teammates used to spend their spring training preparing for the upcoming season for the Dodgers. Owned by former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley, Historic Dodgertown will host the 2014 celebration by putting on a minor league exhibition game.

Hjalte Rasmussen

Hjalte Rasmussen (December 18, 1940 - August 9, 2012) was Professor of European Union Law at the University of Copenhagen. Previously he was a Professor of law at the Law Department of the Copenhagen Business School and a Visiting Professor at the College of Europe, at Bruges.
For his 70th birthday a liber amicorum was published under the title "Europe. The New Legal Realism - Essays in Honour of Hjalte Rasmussen", (2010) edited by Henning Koch, Karsten Hagel-Sørensen, Ulrich Haltern and Joseph H.H. Weiler. 
His doctoral thesis "On Law and Policy in the European Court of Justice. A Comparative Study in Judicial Policymaking" was a ground-breaking critique of the European Court of Justice as policy-maker and was fiercely controversial. It was the first academically respectable book to question the Court's embrace of judicial activism in seeking to further European integration. 
The eminent British scholar Professor Paul Beaumont states: "The academic community of scholars interested in European Law owes a debt to Hjalte Rasmussen for his willingness to break out of the general mould of eulogising the Court of Justice in his controversial book in 1986. Judges are not democratically accountable and therefore their actions must be held to account by the small group of people who have the time and the training to follow their work closely. Criticism of the Court should be accepted as normal, especially by members of the Court. If the Court is acting properly its judgments and its apologists will have answers for their critics. Rasmussen may have had little to do with the Court's greater self-restraint in the 1990s but it is a welcome development. He is absolutely right to insist that the future direction of the European Union should be determined by its peoples in intergovernmental conferences and in the legislative process not by judicial rewriting of the words of the EC Treaty to conform to the Court's view of the meaning of the vague and inconclusive objectives of the Union set out at the beginning of the EC Treaty." 
He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

MG M-type

The MG M-type was produced by the MG Car company from April 1929 to 1932. It was sometimes referred to as the 8/33. Launched at the 1928 London Motor Show when the sales of the larger MG saloons was faltering because of the economic climate, the small car brought MG ownership to a new sector of the market and probably saved the company. Early cars were made in the Cowley factory, but from 1930 production had transferred to Abingdon.
This 2-door sports car used an updated version of the four-cylinder bevel-gear driven overhead camshaft engine used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor giving at 4000 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was based on the one used in the 1928 Morris Minor with lowered suspension using half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and bolt on wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 78 inches (1980 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm).
1930 brought a series of improvements to the car. The Morris rod brake system, with the handbrake working on the transmission, was replaced a cable system with cross shaft coupled to the handbrake and the transmission brake deleted. Engine output was increased to by improving the camshaft and a four-speed gearbox was offered as an option. The doors became front-hinged. A supercharged version could be ordered from 1932, raising the top speed to .
Early bodies were fabric-covered using a wood frame; this changed to all-metal in 1931. Most cars had bodies made by Carbodies of Coventry and fitted by MG in either open two-seat or closed two-door "Sportsmans" coupé versions, but some chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders such as Jarvis. The factory even made a van version as a service vehicle. The car could reach 65 mph (105 km/h) and return 40 miles per gallon. The open version cost £175 at launch, soon rising to £185, and the coupé cost £245. The 1932 supercharged car cost £250.
The M-type had considerable sporting success, both privately and with official teams winning gold medals in the 1929 Land's End Trial and class wins in the 1930 "Double Twelve" race at Brooklands. An entry was also made in the 1930 Le Mans 24 hour, but neither of the two cars finished.

Félicien Trewey

Félicien Trewey, born Félicien-François Trevey (May 23, 1848 - December 2, 1920), was a French magician, mime, comedian, vaudevillian, tightrope walker, balance artist, dancer, musician, chapeaugraphist and shadowgraphist. The principal of Trewey's entertainment was balancing tricks, which at the time he was a grand master. He was a great card-thrower, scaling cards at great distances. He gave musical entertainment with instruments of his own invention. He had great skill in the uncommon art of writing any words selected by his audience backwards and was an exceptional lightning sketch artist. King Edward VII had witnessed Trewey on many occasions and the Emperor of Austria, Baron Rothschild, as well as many others, have on more than one occasion sent for him to come perform for them. He has also played in several films directed by his good friend Louis Lumière of The Lumière Brothers, including "Chapeaux a Transformations" (1895), "The Photographe" (1895), "Danseuses des rues" (1896), and was uncredited in the 1895 film "Partie de cartes" ("Card Game"; US title: "The Messers. Lumière at Cards").
Life and career.
Trewey was born in a workshop in the paper-making town of Angoulême in France. His father was a machinist who worked at one of the manufactories and lived on the premises. Although his father wanted him to become an engineer at the manufactory, Trewey made up his mind what he wanted to do at seven years old. He was taken to a circus in Marseille and saw a conjurer. He immediately began practicing juggling and magic tricks. His performances were accepted and encouraged by his schoolmates. He set up a "rough proscenium" at a back window of his dad's house where he performed the ever-so-popular Punch and Judy by draping rags over his hands.
At the age of ten, his father tried yielding his love of conjuring by sending him to a seminary to become a priest. There he would practice his love in the gymnasium. He did very good in the school plays there and always tried being the comic man. After three years at the seminar, his parents went to Marseille for a short holiday but decided to stay. As he was kept at home, engineering boosted and he went to work in the factory daily. It was actually a delightful change and he could go see all the conjurers and jugglers at the circus. He worked around a lathe which could make conjuring items and being surrounded by items he could balance (i.e. hammers, vices, anvils) he practiced and progressed his skills rapidly.
At fifteen years old, and after practicing since he was seven, he decided he could perform publicly and being near expert he went on to his professional career after running away with a not-much-older professional acrobat. The two traveling boys were fairly successful while performing at cafes around the neighborhoods, but at times they found themselves tired and hungry. Sometimes they had to rely on borrowing objects from the owner of the cafe for juggling and balancing feats such as knives, bottles, forks and such. After a year on the road, his reputation grew and landed him in a Marseille music hall, making tenpence (a coin worth ten pennies) a day. He took part in comedy and pantomime every night. The audience appreciated the performances by throwing money onto the stage, which Trewey got a good share of. He saved up enough money to buy himself two new costumes. He was able to command himself an engagement at the Alcazar, a principal place for amusement in Marseille, where he found himself his first great success. He was now seventeen years old and his success was constantly improving, as was his skills. He soon became a favorite performer in popular towns South of France for the next three to four years. He then went back to being a peripatetic and became a proprietor of a traveling caravan pantomime and variety company. During their travels, Trewey would play many parts, including Pierrot and Cassandre, the clown and pantaloon of French pantomime. He also danced the "Clodoche", a grotesque quadrille.
Trewey was most successful in Bordeaux, performing new feats of balancing, a new and original style of entertainment at the time. It was a style he became identified with and "Treweyism" became a household word. His appearance of "the clown de Salon" consists of a black skin-tight costume, a chalked face, and a white powdered periwig. He was offered a performance at the Concert des Ambassadeurs in Paris and it was there his success was complete. Since then, he was never without any gigs. He stayed in Paris for nine years, performing at all the principal places of entertainment. Afterwards, he toured in many places around Europe (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Spain, Russia, Germany, England) with great success. His success was so great in Spain, matchboxes were sold bearing his portrait. His portrait (with political and social significance) appeared in well-known papers all across Europe, including "Journal Illustre", "Illustrationa Spana y America", "Der Wostellung Zeitung", "La Campana de Gracia", "La Bombe", "Le Jeune Garde", "La Caricature", "The Entr'acte", "The Looking Glass", and "The Northern Review". In 1889, when Trewey was around 40 years of age, he joined Alexander Herrmann in New York. Then in the later half of 1920, after living a long successful, eventful and strenuous life, Trewey died at an advanced age (72); the same year his book "The Art of Shadowgraphy: How it is Done" was published.

The Story of Egmo

The Story of Egmo is a popular ebook and audiobook by Ben Cormack originally available in late 2006. In early 2007 the London Library Development Agency promoted the book, which was made available for free download, as part of its first literacy campaign targeted at children and young adults. The book received over 25,000 downloads within the first year.
Plot.
The protagonist, 'Egmo' is an ill-fated anti hero whose many eccentricities put him firmly out of step with the world and everyone in it. When he unearths the global domination plans of local would-be-criminal-mastermind Krapodkin he sets out on a fantastical mission to restore relative normality.
Critical reception.
"The Story of Egmo" achieved national recognition from The Independent, N.U.T. magazine and Viz.
Radio Serialisation.
In 2010/2011 "The Story of Egmo" was serialised by Saint FM, narrated by Ben Cormack. The series divided listeners: whilst some feedback suggested it was among the very best programming of that genre, one listener complained that it was completely incomprehensible. In general the series was critically very well received and attracted a large audience. The station re-ran the series in its entirety in 2011.
Spin-off.
'Francis and Bunty', a short story set in the 'Story of Egmo' universe, was used to front the 2009 'Best Writer in the Universe' short story competition. It was narrated for the Story of Egmo podcast by popular comedian and BBC presenter Adam Buxton.

New Hall School

New Hall is a coeducational independent day and boarding school in the village of Boreham within the borough of Chelmsford, Essex, England. It was originally founded in Belgium by Sisters of the female Catholic order Canonesses of the Holy Sepulchre and moved to its current location, a former Tudor Palace of Beaulieu in Essex. The school is now mostly run by lay staff but still retains its Catholic ethos and ties with the local diocese. It is the only independent Catholic school in the Diocese and one of the largest of its kind in the country.
The school operates in "diamond" format. The preparatory school and sixth form are coeducational while the senior school remains segregated. The senior girls' section is a member of the Girls' Schools Association and the school principal is a member of the HMC.
History.
The school was founded in Liège, Belgium in 1642 by Susan Hawley, who also formed the English Community of the Canonesses Regular of the Holy Sepulchre. The founding Religious Order, the Canonesses Regular of the Holy Sepulchre, is one of the most ancient in the Church and was established in Europe long before the English Religious Community was founded in 1642. Initially the school offered a Catholic education to girls who were denied this in England in the Post-Protestant Reformation period. In 1794, the French Revolutionary Wars forced the nuns to leave the Low Countries. The school reopened on its present site in 1799.
In 1994, the Preparatory School was re-established on the campus at New Hall. Opening with 40 pupils, the school grew rapidly over the following years. In 2003, the Preparatory School welcomed its first boarders and the boarding programme was later extended to boys as well.
In 2001, New Hall appointed its first lay principal, Mrs Katherine Jeffrey. In April 2005, the administration made a landmark decision to go fully coeducational, ending over 360 years of single-sex education. The announcement was made that the Senior School would be embarking on a period of further expansion, with the establishment of a separate Boys’ Division (11-16) and a co-educational Sixth Form. The Senior School now accepts boys throughout the 11-18 age range and there are 3 boys’ boarding houses fully established, in addition to the 3 girls’ boarding houses.
The move towards coeducation using the "diamond format" proved extremely successful. New Hall was commended by judges at the 2011 Independent School Awards for the "ambitious and pioneering move" and won the award for "outstanding strategic initiative".
Buildings.
In 1517, the estate was acquired by King Henry VIII, who greatly enlarged and enhanced the building and called it Beaulieu. The Royal Arms of Henry VIII are now to be seen in the school Chapel. For many years the home of Mary Tudor, New Hall was subsequently granted to the Earl of Sussex by Queen Elizabeth I. Oliver Cromwell later procured the estate for 5 shillings.
Houses.
There are eight vertical houses named after Catholic Martyrs:
The Preparatory School Houses are named after Saints from the Four Gospels:
The boarding houses follow a horizontal structure and are named as follows:
Academic.
New Hall has a strong academic record and regularly tops the exam results table for Essex county. In the 2006 A Levels, it achieved a 100% pass rate and the following year, 75% scored A-B grades.
Pastoral Care.
Pupils are required to attend regular chapel services. Practicing Catholic pupils may choose to actively participate in spiritual activities such as Bible studies and the annual pilgrimage to Lourdes. The school chapel runs weekly Sunday mass which are open to the public and serves the Parish of St Augustine of Canterbury, Springfield. Pupils and staff often serve as musicians, choristers, altar servers, sacristans and readers.
Extracurricular Activities.
Sport.
Students compete at county, regional, national and international level in a wide range of sports and have met with success. In recent years, there has been a significant investment in the sports facilities on campus. The first-class provision now includes: The Waltham Centre 25m 6-lane indoor swimming pool; a national standard athletics track and floodlit Astroturf; 10 floodlit tennis/netball courts; two sports halls; Parsons Hall dance studio; junior and senior cricket wickets and indoor training nets; hockey, rugby and football pitches. New Hall also has well-established links with a local riding school and a golf club.
The more popular sports are cricket, hockey, netball, rugby, and tennis. There is a wide variety of other sports, including aerobics & pilates, athletics, badminton, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, riding, swimming, volleyball and triathlon.
Performing arts.
The Walkfares Performing Arts Centre is the home of thriving Music, Dance and Drama Departments. Performances, from Shakespeare to modern plays and musicals, give students the opportunity to develop their confidence and creative talents.
All students are encouraged to participate in the English Speaking Board (ESB) or London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) programmes. Students take individual lessons in orchestral instruments, piano, singing, drums and electric guitars. A growing number of students take lessons on the newly restored Norman & Beard Organ in the Chapel.
There is a host of performing groups, including senior and junior choirs, chamber choirs, a chapel choir, a senior orchestra, a strings academy, wind bands, a guitar ensemble, and chamber groups. Students are also encouraged to form jazz and pop bands and specialist support and facilities are available.
Regular performances are given by students in assemblies, lunchtime recitals and formal concerts. Students take part in regional and national musical festivals and competitions, and groups tour regularly to perform in major venues in Europe.
New Hall School Choir, directed by Andrew Fardell, has performed at St. Peters, Rome, St. Marks, Venice, Westminster Cathedral, London as well as on BBC Television. The choir sings a wide range of music from sacred to secular, classic to modern.
The Dance Company was founded in September 2003 to facilitate the increased demand from students who wanted more opportunities to train and perform. The Company has students from Year 10 upwards. The Company has taken parts in a variety of events in and around Chelmsford and has an important role in supporting the Dance Department within the School.
Drama forms a part of student activity at New Hall. Each year the Senior School produces a large scale production just before Christmas during which many students experience the exhilaration of being part of this tradition. Recent productions have included ‘Daisy’, ‘Lark Rise’, ‘Rock Nativity’ and ‘West Side Story’. Other notable productions are provided by the Drama and Theatre Studies students whose productions have included Woyzeck, Waiting for Godot, Teechers, Arabian Nights and Grimm Tales. Students have the option to do GCSE and A Levels drama.
The Eaton Theatre, equipped with lighting and sound technology, provides a traditional performance venue whilst in Walkfares, two well equipped, versatile studios provide the environment for both teaching and for a range of performances.
Notable former pupils.
Former pupils are known as "Old Fishes". The term has been used for former students from as early as 1799. At the time of Catholic persecution in mainland Europe, the founding Religious Community were forced to leave the Low Countries and to move to England. Whilst they were seeking a suitable venue in England, the nuns referred to students as "Fishes" and the term eventually stuck.

Dutchess Company Superintendent's House

The Dutchess Company Superintendent's House is located on Market Street in the western corner of the village of Wappingers Falls, New York, United States. It is a large brick residence that was built as housing for the manager of the Dutchess Company, a large local printing works, shortly after the plant was built in 1848.
It is primarily in the Greek Revival architectural style, with some Gothic Revival decorative touches. In 1984 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Building.
The house is a three-story, five-bay brick building with a symmetrical front facade. The front entrance and its sidelights are centrally located on a shed-roofed porch built in the mid 20th-century. It replaced an original veranda that wrapped around all but the east side. A portion was left on the north side, along with its Gothic Revival posts, capitals and other trim.
On the roofline, a steeply pitched central gable, decorated with Gothic Revival vergeboard, reinforces the entrance. There are two brick chimneys at either end of the roof.
The inside floor plan is the standard Greek Revival central-hall style. The entrance's sidelights and full transom are also hallmarks of that style. There are no outbuildings.
History.
The house was built in 1848, shortly after the Dutchess Company was incorporated. The first superintendent, a Mr. Radclift, was its first occupant.
It remained in company ownership until the company failed in the 20th century, at which point it was purchased by the then-superintendent, William Bogle. It has remained a private home ever since.
Aesthetics.
The house's design and location reflect some social considerations as well as aethetic ideals of its time. Its Greek Revival scale and mass reflect the factory superintendent's superior position within the community's industrial hierarchy, as well as its location some distance away from the plant and worker housing in the center of town, echoing the superintendent's position distance from his subordinates. It was similar to the company owners' houses (none of which survive intact) in size, but unlike them it was located at the bottom of the hill, closer to the plant and the workers than they were.
Its decorative touches, such as the piazza-style original veranda, pointed gable and scroll-sawn vergeboard, suggest an embrace of the Picturesque mode then being popularized by Andrew Jackson Downing of nearby Newburgh. The house's placement in a wooded area near Wappinger Creek is also reflective of this ideal.

Baby Love (film)

Baby Love is a 1968 British drama film, directed by Alastair Reid and starring Ann Lynn, Keith Barron, Linda Hayden and Diana Dors. The film tells the story of a schoolgirl who seduces her adoptive family after her mother commits suicide.
Reid went on to work in television, while Linda Hayden, who was only 15 at the time of filming, went on to star in sexploitation movies, notably two of the films in the "Confessions" series, "Confessions of a Window Cleaner" (1974) and "Confessions from a Holiday Camp" (1977). The film features an uncredited appearance by Bruce Robinson, later to direct the cult film "Withnail & I".
Plot.
Luci (Linda Hayden) lives alone with her promiscuous, alcoholic mother (a strange, mute, cameo by Diana Dors) in a poor suburb of London. Coming home from school one day Luci discovers her mother's body in the bathtub, her mother has slit her wrists.
Robert (Keith Barron), her mother's high school true love, discovers that she wrote a last letter pleading with him to look after Luci. Robert agrees and takes Luci to his home where she meets his rich wife Amy (Anne Lynn) and their teenage son, Nick (Derek Lamden).
Luci holds Robert responsible for her mother's tragic life and death because he not only left her to go on to university, but left her pregnant. Luci's wanton sexuality and resentment soon starts to cause friction in the household as one by one the family comes under her spell.
At a movie theatre, Luci subtly offers herself up to an older man (a mute role for the prolific Vernon Dobtcheff) in the seat next to her, awaiting his touch on her bare leg, barely disguising the obvious thrill of that touch until the disgusted (yet entranced) Nick pulls her away. But Luci comes across as a young woman simply craving the love and closeness she has never had, in the only way that seems possible to her due not only because of her upbringing but due to the fact that with her mother gone there seems no chance now for the parental love she really wants, so she makes do with the less innocent kind. Even the sexual 'love' of a stranger is better than no love at all.
The relationship with her 'adoptive' mother is a fascinatingly murky one at first. Amy feels a void in her life at never having a daughter. The coldly masculine influence of her son and husband (plus their now equally cold marriage, shown perfectly in a bedroom scene where she says goodnight to Robert but receives no kiss only a grunt).
Amy comes into the bathroom when Luci is in the bathtub and comforts her (due to Luci's obvious distress when the hot, steaming, water reminds her of her mother's suicide scene) and lightly bathes her takes on a pointed lesbian feel due to how old Luci is. Later Luci crudely offers herself sexually to Amy in a desperate attempt to secure her place in the household.
The easy-going family of Robert, a doctor, Amy, his wife, Nick, their teen-age son are each magnetized by the girl but, rather naively, are unaware of each other's reactions.

Webster's Mill, Framsden

Framsden Windmill is a Grade II* listed post mill at Framsden, Suffolk, England which is preserved. The mill was known as Webster’s Mill when it was a working mill.
History.
"Framsden Windmill" was built in 1760 for John Flick. In 1836, the mill was bought by John Smith, a brickmaker from St Osyth, Essex. Smith had the mill raised by and modernised by John Whitmore and Son, millwrights, of Wickham Market. In 1843, the mill was bought by William Bond, who owned the mill until 1872 (and worked it for at least part of that time), when it was sold to Joseph Rivers. In 1879, the mill was sold to Edmund Webster, who had been listed as a miller at the mill in 1854, and later passed to his son Edmund Samuel Webster, who worked the mill until "ca." 1936. In June 1966 a group of volunteers started to restore the mill. Two new Patent sails were fitted in 1969 and the fantail was replaced in 1972.
Restoration.
Restoration of "Framsden Windmill" commenced in June 1966. A stock had broken and half a sail had fallen shortly before, so the remaining half sail and its partner were removed, along with the stock. The roof was made watertight and the left side bottom side rail was strengthened. This work was carried out by Frank Farrow, Stanley Freese, Christopher Hullcoop, Vincent Pargeter and Peter Stenning. In 1967, the main post was strengthened with iron bars and steel hoops as it was badly split. The mill was at that time head-sick, and leant to the right. This was attended to, and the mill put back on an even keel. The right hand side girt was found to have broken at the joint with the crown tree. It was reinforced with a heavy angle iron bolted on top. In 1968, the two remaining sails were lowered for repair and the stock was reinforced by fitting a pair of clamps. In 1969, the Brake Wheel was repaired, with two new elm segments being made and fitted. The repaired sails were refitted in March and July. The striking gear was repaired, with the cross from Victoria Mill, Eye replacing that broken when the sail fell. On 7 February 1970, the mill turned by wind again. A lightning conductor was fitted and the Brake Wheel was re-cogged with hornbeam. The Brake Wheel originally had 61 cogs, and was refitted with 78 cogs when the mill was modernised. In 1971, work was done to get the left-hand pair of millstones into working order and repair the fantail carriage. In May 1972, the mill ground wheat for the first time in preservation. The rear steps were repaired and the fantail carriage fitted in 1973.
Description.
"Framsden Windmill" was built as an open trestle post mill with Common sails and winded by a tailpole. The two pairs of millstones were arranged Head and Tail, each driven by a compass arm wheel. A roundhouse was added in 1836 and a fantail was added. At this time, the wooden windshaft was replaced by a cast iron one and Patent sails were added. The compass-arm Brake Wheel was converted to clasp-arm construction. The mill drives two pairs of French Burr millstones in the breast of the mill, the left hand pair are diameter and the right hand pair are diameter. Unusually, the Upright Shaft is offset. The millstones are geared at 7.8:1. The rear of the mill has been extended to accommodate a flour dresser. The Patent sails have a weather of 25˚ at the heel and 5˚ at the tip. The frame of the mill was built of oak, with pitch pine being introduced for the Sprattle Beam and Tail beam when the mill was modernised. The mill is to the roof, making it the second tallest post mill in Suffolk. The sails were wide with a span of .
Millers.

Reuter was a correspondent with and admirer of the German Darwinist Ernst Haeckel"In 1868 Haeckel had given his first edition of the natural history of creation and this work, more than any other, made Darwinism to a generally accepted world view… Reuter’s dissertation carries a label of its time. It is a typical phylogenetic handling, inspired by Haeckel’s spirit that at the close of the century totally dominated the biological research."(Federley H., 1951)

Peggy Olson

Margaret "Peggy" Olson (born May 25, 1939) is a fictional character in the AMC television series "Mad Men", and is portrayed by actress Elisabeth Moss. Initially, Peggy is secretary to Don Draper (Jon Hamm), creative director of the advertising agency Sterling Cooper. Later, she is promoted to copywriter, the first female writer at the firm since World War II. She later joins Draper when he leaves Sterling Cooper to become a founding member of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. By the end of Season 4, Peggy is effectively Draper's second-in-command in the creative department. Towards the end of season five, Peggy accepts a job offer from another agency and quits her job at SCDP. However, following a merger between SCDP and CGC her new workplace, Peggy finds herself working again with Don Draper.
Biography.
Peggy Olson is initially presented as an innocent but determined young woman, eager to be a success in her job at Sterling Cooper after having graduated from the respected Miss Deaver's secretarial school. She was born on May 25, 1939, and was brought up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, New York in a Roman Catholic Norwegian-American family. When she was 12 years old, her father died of a heart attack in front of her.
Peggy has an immense dislike of the double standard in regard to the vices of men and women and appears to be quite feminist in her views.
At Sterling Cooper.
In the pilot episode, "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", which takes place in March 1960, Peggy begins work as a secretary for Don Draper. Her supervisor, office manager Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), directs her in her duties as well as offers personal advice, which includes referring her to a gynecologist to obtain a prescription for birth control pills. When Peggy meets account executive Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) for the first time, he makes rude comments about her appearance, prompting Don to defend her. Later that night, after his bachelor party, Pete shows up at Peggy's apartment drunk. Despite his offensive remarks earlier, Peggy sleeps with Pete that night. Months later, Peggy and Pete have another sexual encounter, this time on Pete's office couch, early one morning before other employees arrive.
In "Babylon", Sterling Cooper executive Freddy Rumsen notices Peggy's sharp mind and creativity during a focus group for Belle Jolie lipstick. After hearing Peggy's insightful remarks during a brainstorming session, Rumsen comments that her performance "was like watching a dog play the piano". She is asked to write some copy for the campaign in addition to her other duties. The campaign is a success, and she is soon promoted to Junior Copywriter. She reveals herself to be highly ambitious, and her approach to her work is compared to Don's. Later, after Rumsen is fired, Peggy convinces Senior Partner Roger Sterling to give her Rumsen's office.
In the fall of 1960, Peggy rips her skirt trying to pick something up off of the floor, which prompts her to begin wearing oversize suits and baggy dress-and-jacket outfits. She also experiences noticeable weight gain (portrayed by Moss wearing a "fat suit" and facial appliances). Account executive Ken Cosgrove jokes to his male co-workers that Peggy looks like a lobster, because all her "meat" is in her "tail". Despite having coldly ended his brief affair with Peggy, Pete reacts strongly to Ken's remark and punches him in the face.
Office manager Joan Holloway makes snide remarks to Peggy about her weight gain, warning that she will remain a virgin because of her appearance. Peggy informs Joan that she is, in fact, not a virgin, and calls Joan out on her condescending attitude.
At the end of Season One, which takes place just before Thanksgiving 1960, Peggy begins to have severe stomach pains right after she is promoted to Junior Copywriter, heading up the new Clearasil account. Peggy attributes the stomach pain to bad office food "from the cart", and heads to St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn. She is shocked and in complete denial when the doctor tells her she's actually in labor. She gets up to leave, but immediately collapses, and the doctor orders her into the labor room. He also orders a psychiatrist to see her. She gives birth to a healthy baby boy.
Season Two begins 15 months later, on February 14, 1962, with a slim Peggy and no mention of the birth. Her long absence (which is not shown) is a mystery to Sterling Cooper's employees. One co-worker cracks during a meeting that "Draper knocked her up and she's dropped nine pounds, eight ounces." Pete, for his part, heard through office gossip that Peggy simply went to a fat farm.
Later in the season, it is revealed through a series of flashbacks that Peggy's mother and then very-pregnant sister have covered up Peggy's sudden disappearance from Sterling Cooper. They tell Don that Peggy is in quarantine with tuberculosis. Don becomes suspicious and seeks her out at the hospital, where he finds her in a terrible mental state (though it is not clear if he's learned of her pregnancy), and Don realizes her hospitalization is not due to tuberculosis. He encourages her to forget about the entire thing, advising she should "move forward", and would be surprised at how easy it would be to pretend "this" never happened.
Meanwhile, Peggy's sister Anita, who has since given birth to her third child, is resentful of Peggy and tells their young new parish priest, Father Gill, that Peggy seduced a married man, got pregnant, and was forced to give up the baby. (Later, in "The Suitcase", Peggy reveals that because only Don visited her at the hospital, her family believed he had fathered her illegitimate child). Throughout Season Two, Father Gill, who is progressive in nature and relies on Peggy's advertising sensibilities several times, repeatedly tries to persuade Peggy to take confession, but Peggy consistently declines. By the end of the season, she leaves the church.
In "The Jet Set", copywriter Kurt Smith gives Peggy a makeover, cutting her demure ponytail in favor of a shorter, more modern hairstyle.
In the Season 2 finale, set during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Pete asks Peggy to come into his office and sit down with him. Pete has come to the realization that he never should have married his wife Trudy; he should have married Peggy, instead, when he "had the chance". Peggy reveals that she had his baby and gave it away two years ago. This admission is particularly shocking and hurtful to Pete, as Trudy appears to be infertile and wishes to adopt, an idea that Pete initially rejects, reconsiders, and then vehemently rejects again. Peggy walks away from Pete.
In Season 3 (1963), Peggy's ideas for advertising, while respected, are frequently ignored. In particular, her comment that the proposed ad campaign for Pepsi's new diet cola Patio, involving a shot-for-shot remake of Ann-Margret's opening scene in "Bye Bye Birdie", would not actually appeal to the female target audience, is dismissed. When the ad in question is shot down by Pepsi (whose idea it was in the first place), she smiles to herself.
Due to the lengthy commute from Brooklyn, Peggy decides to move to an apartment in Manhattan, which her mother regards as an affront. Peggy posts an ad at SC for a roommate. Following Joan's advice to make her ad about fun and good times, and post it somewhere other than at SC, Peggy finds a prospective roommate in Karen Ericson; her conversation with Karen reveals that Peggy is Norwegian, at least on her father's side (Karen is Swedish American, though Peggy tells her mother that Karen is Norwegian).
Peggy becomes romantically involved with Duck Phillips, and he seeks to lure her and Pete away to his firm. Pete is uninterested in working for Duck, but Peggy's passing temptation is fueled by a feeling of being unappreciated by Sterling Cooper, and Don in particular, who had previously shut down her attempt to get a raise. However, she joins Don and others in forming a new ad agency after Don reassures her that he values her work. Peggy's relationship with Duck is complicated by his chronic alcoholism. It completely collapses after he gets into a drunken brawl with Don in the SCDP offices.
At Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (SCDP).
In the fourth season (1964–65), Peggy perseveres as a trusted member of the SCDP creative staff, despite lingering resentment and patronizing from most of the men she works with. Her affair with Duck has ended and she has begun dating a man named Mark. However, the relationship becomes strained as Peggy led Mark to believe he was her first lover. Mark breaks up with her following a fiasco on Peggy's birthday in which Mark planned a surprise birthday dinner, inviting Peggy's family, and she canceled last minute due to work. Peggy then becomes friends with Joyce Ramsay (portrayed by Zosia Mamet), a writer for "Life" magazine and a lesbian. Peggy develops feelings for one of Joyce's beatnik friends, Abe Drexler (played by Charlie Hofheimer); their relationship is almost derailed because of his subtle sexism and criticisms of advertising, but eventually blooms into a romance. Despite friction over Peggy's work life, she accepts Abe's proposal to live together in her apartment. The relationship causes strain between Peggy and her mother, who is horrified that her daughter is "living in sin" with a Jewish man.
In the episode "Far Away Places" her behavior appears to have mirrored Don's in the first episode: smoking, heavy drinking, manipulative behaviour and meaningless sexual encounters. However, Peggy's relationship with Abe develops when they move in with each other in "At the Codfish Ball".
In the season five episode "The Other Woman", Peggy accepts a job offer from another agency, Cutler, Gleason and Chaough, and quits her job at SCDP on the advice of Freddy Rumsen. She tells this news to Don, who kisses her on the hand before she disappears into an elevator.
At Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough (CGC).
Peggy is widely respected by her superiors and feared by her subordinates at CGC. Her secretary, Phyllis, advises her to try a little positive reinforcement along with her criticism, but she gets mixed results. Peggy frequently works late, sharing gossip and news with Stan Rizzo by phone. In a moment of weakness, Ted kisses Peggy, and she is later revealed to have romantic feelings for Ted, as well.
In "The Flood", Peggy and Megan are nominated for a prestigious advertising award for their Heinz Baked Beans ad. They are the only SCDP/SC&P nominees, despite the fact that neither works there any more. The evening is interrupted by news of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and in a final frame showing the CLIO in Megan's living room, the audience quietly learns that she and Peggy won the award.
When Don and Ted join forces to pitch Chevrolet, leading the two firms to merge, they turn to Peggy to draft the press release. Both are oblivious to Peggy's obvious distress.
At Sterling Cooper & Partners (SC&P).
Joan, who is pleased to see her, assigns Peggy to the office previously used by Harry Crane and Pete Campbell, which features an awkwardly placed pillar. Peggy has been unanimously declared Copy Chief, but finds it very difficult to serve two masters, as she is almost continually put in the middle of Don and Ted's leadership squabbles.
In "The Better Half", Peggy finally admits to Abe how much she dislikes her new apartment and its dangerous neighborhood, announcing her intention to sell it, even if she takes a loss. That night, she hears a noise and, frightened, goes to check it out with a homemade bayonet to protect herself but accidentally stabs Abe. In the ambulance, Abe labels her an enemy to his beliefs and breaks up with her.
In "A Tale of Two Cities", Joan recruits Peggy to assist her in securing Avon as a client, but Peggy is distressed to discover that Joan has excluded Pete (who had been ordered to handle it by Ted) from the proceedings and is trying to manage things on her own. Peggy and Joan have a heated discussion about their different paths to power, but when Pete and Ted confront Joan, Peggy realizes Joan needs support from someone who believes in her, and so improvises a fake phone call that saves Joan's neck.
In "The Quality of Mercy", Don and Megan catch Ted and Peggy together at the movies during a work day. Their clear affection for each other is obvious and bothersome to everyone in the office. Don criticizes Ted for allowing Peggy free rein to exceed the budget on an overly expensive but brilliant television ad. In a client meeting, Don soothes the client's worries about the expense (which could clearly jeopardize the account), but attributing the ad concept to the late Frank Gleason. While this tactic saves the account, it takes credit away from Peggy, who had hoped to win a CLIO Award for it. Don also subtly alludes to the inappropriate relationship between Peggy and Ted (which only the SC&P insiders catch), prompting Ted to back off from Peggy. In response, Peggy calls Don a monster.
In the Season 6 finale, "In Care Of", Peggy leaves the office for a date in a revealing dress, doused in Chanel No. 5. Ted is waiting at her apartment when she returns; he confesses that he loves her and promises to leave his wife, and he and Peggy finally consummate their relationship. However, the next morning, Ted asks Don to let him manage the SC&P office in California, in an effort to put as much distance between him and Peggy as possible and start over with his family. Don eventually relents, and Ted informs Peggy of his plans. Peggy is furious at Ted's about face and unilateral decision, and sneers, "Well, aren't you lucky, to have decisions?"
Don's erratic attendance and behavior cause concern, and in the wake of the disastrous Hershey's pitch meeting, the partners (Bert, Roger, Jim, and Joan) place him on a "leave of absence" of unspecified duration. Peggy, working late, takes over Don's office because it's "where everything is".
Peggy's relationship with Don Draper.
During Season Four (1964–65), Peggy's complex working relationship with Don Draper continues to evolve as he relies on her to handle important accounts. Peggy is often openly resentful of Don's demanding requirements and his refusal to express appreciation for her work, but is also conscious that he is the only one in the firm who views her as an equal to her fellow copywriters, notwithstanding her gender.
When in "Maidenform" (Season 2) Peggy questions her male colleagues' categorizations of women as "Marilyns" or "Jackies" and asks which she is, Ken quips that she's Gertrude Stein, and the younger men laugh. Don quickly counters that Peggy is Irene Dunne, which Freddy supports with, "I love Irene Dunne".
Don and Peggy's relationship is solidified when Don forces Peggy to work all night on her birthday (in "The Suitcase"). Though she is initially angry at Don for having to cancel dinner plans with her boyfriend to accommodate his work demands, they spend the night discussing their lives and Don reveals to her details of his past. Peggy helps Don through another drunken binge and defuses a confrontation between him and Duck Phillips, who shows up at the office searching for Peggy in a drunken stupor of his own. The two fall asleep on Don's office couch as he lies with his head in Peggy's lap. Later that morning, a distraught Don weeps in Peggy's presence after he learns of Anna's death over the telephone. When Don tells Peggy that he has lost the only one in the world who truly knew him, Peggy tenderly places a consoling hand on his shoulder and replies, "That's not true." Later that day, Don conveys his gratitude to Peggy by pausing during an advertisement-related conversation and embracing her hand, briefly shedding his emotional unavailability and confirming their bond.
Peggy appears surprised and disappointed when Don announces his engagement to Megan Calvet, his secretary. Peggy congratulates Don, and Don replies that Megan admires Peggy and considers her a role model of sorts. Peggy interprets the gesture as a backhanded compliment, and in a private chat with Joan she remarks indignantly that Don seems more excited about marrying his secretary than about her own success. Joan tells Peggy that Don is no less superficial and shallow than any of their other male superiors, and his engagement to Megan should come as no surprise.
Peggy and Don's relationship becomes more strained after Don marries Megan and promotes her to copywriter at SCDP. Peggy takes on the role of Megan's mentor and attempts to nurture her apparent talent (although it later turns out Megan is dissatisfied with being a copywriter). Don also gives Peggy more responsibility, as he has begun spending more time at home than at work. Peggy is often frustrated by her new workload, and matters do not improve when the agency hires another male copywriter - Michael Ginsberg - who seems to receive more credit than his supervisor Peggy does for the same amount of work.
After Peggy asks Don if she will be going to Paris with the remainder of the team and requests recognition for saving the Château Cheval Blanc client account (in the Season Five episode, "The Other Woman"), Don throws money in her face, assuming that she is asking for another raise. This is Peggy's breaking point, and she realizes she can no longer stay at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Under advice from Freddy Rumsen, Peggy takes meetings with other agencies, ultimately choosing to go with Don's rival Ted Chaough at Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough, where she will receive more money and the title of Copy Chief. Peggy breaks the news to Don immediately after he learns SCDP has landed Jaguar. Don finally agrees to give Peggy a raise, misinterpreting her announcement that she is leaving as a negotiating tactic and shocked when Peggy turns it down and realizes he is about to lose his protégée. The two share a moment, in which Don grasps her hand and gives it a kiss. Peggy leaves the offices, entering an elevator that is illuminated with light as she begins her journey away from SCDP and Don.
In Season Six, SCDP and CGC merge, reuniting Peggy and Don. In the last episode of Season 6 ("In Care Of"), Ted moves to California and the other partners place Don on a forced leave, making Peggy SC&P's "de facto" creative director. In a much talked-about tableau, the season closes on a shot of Peggy sitting at Don's desk chair, gazing at the New York skyline, in a pose reminiscent of Don's in "Mad Men"'s title card.

<doc id="19646856" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19646856" title="A58 motorway (Netherlands)">
A58 motorway (Netherlands)

The A58 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands. It is approximately 145 kilometers in length. The A58 is located in the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Zeeland.
The A58 connects North Brabant's three major cities Eindhoven, Tilburg and Breda with the cities Goes, Middelburg and Vlissingen in Zeeland.
Road works near Eindhoven.
With the reconstruction works of the "Randweg Eindhoven", the beltway of the city, nearing completion, the A58 motorway has been shortened by a few kilometers. The road now only starts at the interchange Batadorp. The section between its former eastern terminus (interchange Ekkersrijt/John F. Kennedylaan) and the interchange Ekkersweijer has now become part of the A50, while the section between interchanges Ekkersweijer and Batadorp is now only a part of the A2, and is no longer shared with the A58.
Speed limit.
The speed limit on the eastern half is 120 km/h (75 mph), whereas the shared section with the A16, and in Zeeland, the speed limit is 130 km/h (81 mph).
Traffic jams.
The motorway 58 is congested everyday, especially between Oirschot - Tilburg and between Roosendaal - Bergen Op Zoom.
In 2011, experiments with "snelheidsdekens" (lower speed limits) of 90 km/h (55 mph) or even just 70 km/h (43 mph) were set to reduce the amount of traffic jams. It had a counterproductive effect: more traffic jams occurred in January-March 2011.
In 2011, the BZW (Brabant-Zealandic Employers association) got involved with the widening of the roads, while companies located near the motorway complain about the national government's "neglecting and pointing too much to the Randstad". The target is to widen the motorway in Brabant everywhere to at least 2x3 lanes, around Tilburg to 4x2 (with local- express-)lanes and relocate the section through Roosendaal.
Western terminus near Vlissingen.
The A58 motorway section ends just east of the city of Vlissingen. From the intersection where the motorway ends, drivers can go straight ahead towards the N288 road, which brings them to the centre of the city or to a number of towns further to the west on the island. They can also turn left, which brings them to Vlissingen's harbor, from where boats depart towards England and to the town of Breskens, located in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. The latter road has been called 'N58', to create one on-going route number (58) between Brabant and the Vlissingen harbor.
European routes.
Between interchange Batadorp, the future start of the A58, and the western end of the motorway near Vlissingen, the European route E312 follows the road. The shared section of the A58 and the A16 is also part of the European route E19.

Sha Tau Kok Control Point

Sha Tau Kok Control Point () is a land immigration control point of Hong Kong, located in Sha Tau Kok, North District, New Territories, Hong Kong, along the border between mainland China and Hong Kong. The control point is mainly used by vehicles (cars and lorries). It acts as a border gateway from or to places in eastern Guangdong Province, such as Huizhou and Chaoshan. But it is one of the least frequently used immigration control point in Hong Kong. Its counterpart across the border is the Shatoujiao Port.
The border is currently open from 7am to 10pm.

<doc id="19646907" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19646907" title="Virgilio Malvezzi">
Virgilio Malvezzi

Virgilio Malvezzi (1595–1653) was an Italian historian and essayist, soldier and diplomat, born in Bologna. He became court historian to Philip IV of Spain. He used the anagram-pseudonym Grivilio Vezzalmi.
Life.
He fought for the Spanish forces in Flanders.
Olivares called him to Madrid, where he arrived in 1636, to become the official chronicler to Philip IV. In 1640 he was one of the ambassadors sent by Philip to England, in an attempt to avert the marriage of Mary Stuart to William II of Orange.
He became adviser to the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria from 1643.
Writing.
Initially he wrote on Tacitus, in the tradition of Justus Lipsius, but as a Christian neo-stoic, and anti-Ciceronian. Olivares, who became Malvezzi's patron, was also a Lipsian. His style imitated Tacitus, too, in its dour compression, and was criticized for its opacity by the translator Thomas Powell; another view is that his prose was "elegantly laconic". John Milton referred to "Malvezzi, that can cut Tacitus into slivers and steaks".
His political thought was in the tradition of Machiavelli. His "Tarquin" argues the case for dissimulation in politics.
His biography of Olivares ("Ritratto del Privata Politico Christiano") has been called hagiography. It argued that he was right to invoke the reason of state on behalf of the Spanish Empire.
Works.
He wrote in Italian and Spanish, and was early translated into Latin, Spanish, German and English, with a Dutch edition of 1679.

AnyLogic

AnyLogic is a multimethod simulation modeling tool developed by The AnyLogic Company (former XJ Technologies).
History of AnyLogic.
In the beginning of 1990s there was a big interest in the mathematical approach to modeling and simulation of parallel processes. This approach may be applied to the analysis of correctness of parallel and distributed programs. The Distributed Computer Network (DCN) research group at Saint Petersburg Technical University developed such a software system for the analysis of program correctness; the new tool was named COVERS (Concurrent Verification and Simulation). This system allowed graphical modeling notation for system structure and behavior. The tool was applied for the research granted by Hewlett Packard (?).
In 1998 the success of this research inspired the DCN laboratory to organize a company with a mission to develop a new age simulation software. The emphasis in the development was placed on applied methods: simulation, performance analysis, behavior of stochastic systems, optimization and visualization. New software released in 2000 was based on the latest advantages of information technologies: an object-oriented approach, elements of the UML standard, the use of Java, a modern GUI, etc. 
The tool was named AnyLogic, because it supported all three well-known modeling approaches:
+ Any combination of these approaches within a single model.
The first version of AnyLogic was AnyLogic 4, because the numbering continues the numbering of COVERS 3.0.
A big step was taken in 2003, when AnyLogic 5 was released. It was focused on business simulation in the following domains:
The latest major version, AnyLogic 6, was released in 2007. The platform for AnyLogic 6 model development environment is Eclipse. AnyLogic 6 is a cross-platform simulation software as far as it works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
AnyLogic and Java.
AnyLogic includes a graphical modeling language and also allows the user to extend simulation models with Java code. The Java nature of AnyLogic lends itself to custom model extensions via Java coding as well as the creation of Java applets which can be opened with any standard browser. These applets make AnyLogic models very easy to share or place on websites. In addition to Java applets the Professional version allows for the creation of Java runtime applications which can be distributed to users. These pure Java applications can be a base for decision support tools.
Multimethod simulation modeling.
AnyLogic models can be based on any of the main simulation modeling paradigms: discrete event or process-centric (DE), systems dynamics (SD), and agent-based (AB).
System dynamics and discrete event are traditional simulation approaches, agent based is new. Technically, the system dynamics approach deals mostly with continuous processes whereas "discrete event" (by which we mean all descendants of GPSS also known as process-centric simulation approach) and agent based models work mostly in discrete time, i.e. jump from one event to another. 
System dynamics and discrete event simulation historically have been taught at universities to very different groups of students, namely management and economy, industrial and operation research engineers. As a result, there are two distinct practitioners' communities that never talk to each other. 
Agent based modeling until recently has been mostly a purely academic topic. However, the increasing demand for global business optimization caused leading modelers looking at combined approaches to gain a deeper insight into complex interdependent processes having very different natures.
How modeling approaches correspond to the abstraction levels. System dynamics dealing with aggregates is obviously used at the highest abstraction level. Discrete event modeling is used at low to middle abstraction. As for agent based modeling, this technology is used across all abstraction levels, and agent may model objects of very diverse nature and scale: at the "physical" level agents may be e.g. pedestrians or cars or robots, at the middle level – customers, at the highest level – competing companies.
AnyLogic allows the modeler to combine these simulation approaches within the same model. There is no fixed hierarchy. So, as an example, one could create a model of the package shipping industry where carriers are modeled as agents acting/reacting independently whereas the inner workings of their transport and infrastructure networks could be modeled with discrete event simulation. Similarly, one can model consumers as agents whose aggregate behavior feed a systems dynamics model capturing flows such as revenues or costs which do not need to be tied to individual agents. This mixed language approach is directly applicable to a wide variety of complex modeling problems that may be modeled via any one approach albeit with compromises.
Simulation language.
The AnyLogic simulation language consists of following items:
The language also includes: low level modeling constructions (variables, equations, parameters, events etc.), presentation shapes (lines, polylines, ovals etc.), analysis facilities (datasets, histograms, plots), connectivity tools, standard images, and experiments frameworks.
AnyLogic libraries.
AnyLogic includes the following standard libraries:
Beside of these standard libraries user can create his own libraries and distribute them.

Anglo-French Supreme War Council

The Anglo-French Supreme War Council, sometimes known as the Supreme War Council (SWC), was established to oversee joint military strategy at the start of the Second World War. Most of its deliberations took place during the period of the Phoney War, with its first meeting at Abbeville on 12 September 1939. The final three sessions were held in France (Paris, Briare and Tours) during the German Blitzkrieg of May and June 1940.
Meetings of the SWC.
During the Phoney War.
The meeting of the SWC held in Paris on 5 February 1940 was the first to be attended by Winston Churchill, who, as First Lord of the Admiralty, had been invited to participate by Neville Chamberlain. Here the British rejected France’s proposal for an expedition to Petsamo in Finland to help the Finns in the Winter War for fear that this would provoke Soviet Union. Sir Alexander Cadogan, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, described it as a ‘silly scheme’. However, a French plan to send forces to Narvik was approved – this being dependent on agreement from Norway and Sweden. The meeting was described by General Ironside as having been harmonious with ‘everyone purring with pleasure. Wondered if we should all be in the state if we had a little adversity to touch us up.’ In the event, Norway and Sweden, fearful of compromising their neutrality, did not consent to the Narvik plan. The Scandinavian view was interpreted differently by Britain and France – the former taking the view that the operation should be cancelled, but the French maintaining that it had been agreed that the operation should proceed regardless of opposition. However, events overtook the impasse when, on 13 March, the Finns agreed an armistice with the Soviet Union.
The sixth meeting of the SWC was held in London on 28 March 1940 with Britain represented by the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, Lord Halifax, Winston Churchill, Oliver Stanley and Sir Kingsley Wood. This was the first to be attended by Paul Reynaud, the new French Prime Minister, who was accompanied by César Campinchi, the Naval Minister, Victor Laurent-Eynac, the Aviation Minister, M. Charles Corbin (the French Ambassador), M. Alexis Léger, General Maurice Gamelin, Admiral Darlan, General Joseph Vuillemin and General Koeltz. The British were firmly opposed to French plans to bomb Russian oil fields in the Caucasus in order to deprive Germany of Soviet oil supplies. The French agreed to what later became known as Operation Royal Marine, the floating of mines up the Rhine to damage bridges and disrupt barge traffic. However, Reynaud was unable to obtain the approval of his cabinet for such a mining of the Rhine; accordingly the British refused to go along with the plan to mine the waters off the Norwegian coast at Narvik. Politically, the main thrust of this meeting was joint communiqué declaring that: 'Both Governments mutually undertake that during the present war they will neither negotiate nor conclude an armistice or treaty of peace except by mutual agreement. They undertake to maintain after conclusion of peace a community of action for so long as may be necessary'.
In Paris on 5 April, at a meeting which was not of the SWC, Churchill pressed for Operation Royal Marine but, fearing German reprisals, the French refused to countenance any mining of the Rhine. Churchill therefore decided that Britain alone would undertake the mining off Narvik; this action (Operation Wilfred) was planned for 8 April. However, in the meantime, the Germans had launched Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway and Denmark. Paul Reynaud, Édouard Daladier and Admiral Darlan flew to London for an emergency meeting of the SWC on 9 April. Here it was resolved that an Anglo-French task force would be sent to Norway; but the operation (Plan R 4) was a failure - not only did it prove impossible to stop the export of iron ore from Scandinavia to Germany, but the troops had to be evacuated in what was known as Operation Alphabet.
A further meeting of the Council took place in Paris on 22 and 23 April when it was agreed that the Allies would stand fast in Norway; Trondheim and Narvik would continue to be the main objectives. It was also decided that the RAF would, without further discussion, bomb the Ruhr if the Germans were to invade Holland or Belgium.
When the Supreme War Council met on 27 April, the French hoped that Britain would postpone the evacuation of Norway, but this was not to be. Reynaud was furious, deploring 'the old men London who do not know how to take a risk', and returning to Paris with influenza. There was acrimony on both sides - the French convinced that Albion was indeed perfidious and the British stereotyping their ally as 'temperamental'.
During the Battle of France.
Crisis meetings in Paris.
At 7.30 on the morning of 15 May, Winston Churchill, who had been Prime Minister for just five days, received a desperate telephone call from Paul Reynaud announcing that "the French were beaten […] that they had lost the battle." Reynaud begged for all the aircraft and troops that could be spared. The British Prime Minister agreed to fly to Paris the following day to attend what would be the first crisis meeting of the SWC.
On 16 May, Churchill flew to Paris, with Sir John Dill, Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Hastings Ismay, his deputy as Defence Minister, and Air Marshal Joubert de la Ferté, Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. The delegation arrived in Paris during the afternoon and found the French in a state verging on paralysis. General Maurice Gamelin explained that the Germans had broken through on a 50-kilometre front and had already advanced 60 kilometres inward from Sedan. Churchill asked about the strategic reserve - Gamelin replied that there was none. The British Prime Minister then inquired when and where Gamelin proposed to attack the flanks of the bulge. The French general replied with a hopeless shrug and the words: "Inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of method." Six more squadrons were requested for France, over and above the four additional RAF squadrons which had already that morning been authorised. If the French request were heeded, it would leave just 25 squadrons for home defence - the final limit. Churchill explained that a minimum of 39 fighter squadrons was needed to defend British war industries. Bomber aircraft, he argued, would be better employed attacking the Ruhr; they were unsuitable against tanks. However, the same evening, Churchill warned his War Cabinet that more aircraft should be committed for fear that French resistance would crumble as swiftly as that of the Poles. French morale was accordingly raised, but matters were not as they seemed. The six extra squadrons were to be based in Kent and would operate from French airfields only during daylight hours. Moreover, three would fly in the mornings and three in the afternoons; and three had already been committed to France as part of Lord Gort's air power. Over the coming three to four days, the strength of the British Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) would be further reduced.
There was a meeting of the SWC in Paris on 22 May 1940.
A private meeting between Churchill and Reynaud took place over lunch in London on 26 May. Both men deal with the meeting in their memoirs but the precise details are confused. Churchill says that the French prime minister 'dwelt not obscurely with the possible French withdrawal from the war'. Reynaud pressed for more British air support and warned that if the Battle of France were lost, Pétain would urge strongly for an armistice. Yet it seems that Reynaud did not directly ask Britain to release France from its promise made on 28 March not to enter into a separate armistice with Germany. Another meeting was held later the same day, now with Churchill, Chamberlain, Attlee, and Anthony Eden. At this meeting, a suggestion was discussed which had previously been voiced by Lord Halifax - namely the involvement of Italy in a peace conference. If Benito Mussolini would help to safeguard the independence of Britain and France, it would be possible to discuss Italian claims in the Mediterreanean. The latter involved the coast of French Somaliland - Djibouti and the Addis Ababa railway; another concession would be the internationalisation of Malta, Gibraltar and Suez. However, the British opposed such concessions and Churchill confirmed as much in a telegram to Paris the same evening. Despite a great deal of internal opposition, the French did make an approach to Mussolini at the end of the month, but it was scornfully ignored by Rome.
On 31 May 1940, Churchill flew again to Paris for a meeting of the SWC, this time with Clement Attlee and Generals John Dill and Hastings Ismay. Discussions were held at the French Ministry of War on the deteriorating military situation with a French delegation consisting of Reynaud, Philippe Pétain and Maxime Weygand. Also present was Churchill's personal representative to the French Prime Minister, General Sir Edward Spears. Three main points were considered: Narvik, the Dunkirk evacuation and the prospect of an Italian invasion of France. Reynaud complained that at the evacuation, Operation Dynamo, more British troops had been taken off than French. Churchill promised to do everything to redress the balance. During discussions after the meeting, a group formed around Churchill, Pétain and Spears. One of the French officials mentioned the possibility of a separate surrender. Speaking to Pétain, Spears pointed out that such an event would provoke a blockade of France by Britain and the bombardment of all French ports in German hands. Churchill declared that Britain would fight on whatever happened.
Meeting at Briare.
The penultimate session was in France - on 11/12 June at the Chateau du Muguet near Briare where the French army headquarters had withdrawn. Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, General Sir John Dill (Chief of the Imperial General Staff), General Ismay and other staff officers, including General Sir Edward Spears, met the French leader. Reynaud and his cabinet had been forced to leave Paris and the meeting took place at the chateau which was HQ of General Maxime Weygand. Also present was General Charles de Gaulle; Spears had not met him before and was impressed with his bearing. As wrangling continued over the level of support from Britain, Spears suddenly became aware that 'the battle of France was over and that no one believed in miracles'. The next day Weygand's catastrophic account of the military situation reinforced his pessimism. Despite assurances from Admiral Darlan, the British were worried that the powerful French fleet might fall into German hands.
Last-ditch talks at Tours.
Churchill fails to address French cabinet.
The day ended in confusion - Churchill flew back to London without speaking to the French cabinet, as had been promised by Reynaud. The ministers were dismayed and angry; Spears was depressed, realising that 'an opportunity that might not recur had been missed'. He was at a loss to understand why a meeting had not taken place - had Reynaud simply forgotten? Did Reynaud wish to explain the situation to the ministers himself? In any event, his ministers were disillusioned and felt abandoned. Spears believed that this event played its part in swaying the majority of the cabinet towards surrender. He was sure that 'by the night of 13 June, the possibility of France remaining in the war had almost disappeared'. The only hope rested on the decision of President Roosevelt - would America now join the war? 
Military participation.
When the composition of the SWC was decided, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Lord Gort was not a member; yet his French counterpart, General Maurice Gamelin was. In the view of General Edward Louis Spears the failure to include the British C-in-C was a mistake: 'No government should ever lose effective touch with the commander of its army.' 
Organisations associated with the SWC.
Associated bodies were the Anglo-French Purchasing Committee and the Anglo-French Coordinating Committee. The latter, announced in the Times on 28 November and set up in December 1939 was chaired by Jean Monnet; it was responsible for joint economic planning and oversaw ten executive committees which were created in January of the following year. In December 1939, an Anglo-French financial agreement was signed to ensure that contributions to the war effort would be made according to the respective national wealth of each country - France would contribute 40% with Britain responsible for 60%. In addition to the latter, trading agreements and industrial agreements were signed on 16 February 1940 and 7 March 1940 respectively. Paul Reynaud spoke of 'a unity of purpose' which had created a solidarity between the two countries which was more than an alliance. It was agreed that there would be no alteration to the rate of exchange between the two currencies during the war and that each country would be able to cover its requirements in the other's currency without the need to find gold.
Diplomatic activity in parallel with the SWC.
Officials from both sides endeavoured to find ways to make the English and the French view each other more favourably. The British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, asked the Minister of Information (MOI) to provide the French press with details of the arrival of British forces in order to prove that Britain was resolved to contribute fully to the war effort. However, this created tensions with the War Office, which imposed censorship. As a result nothing could be revealed about the British Army and the Royal Air Force in France. This led to absurd situations, as when an American correspondent asked for the text of a leaflet which had been dropped by the Royal Air Force over Germany. The request was refused by the censors on the grounds that 'they were not allowed to disclose information which might be of value to the enemy'! In October 1939, the disparity in troop numbers became a cause for concern in France, which had mobilised 3.5 million men; yet a mere 158,000 British troops had been sent across the English Channel. The Ambassador reported to London hoping that Britain would declare emphatically that these were just an advance guard, and that reinforcements were being swiftly despatched.
The Ambassador further asked the MOI to ensure that there were more articles about France in British newspapers. The few that were published were likely to offend: 'the Englishman in France must be severe with begging children and be prepared to find the French mean and grasping'. There was a suggestion that the "Marseillaise" be played in cinemas after "God Save the King", another that the two languages be made compulsory for pupils in each country. It was even put forward that unemployed French chefs in London should tour British schools to introduce children to French cuisine.
A more ambitious idea came from a Foreign Office official - this was to allow the two countries to operate internationally as a 'single unit' after the war. A committee was established under Lord Maurice Hankey to examine the possibilities of such a union, thus presaging the proposal made by Britain on 16 June 1940 - an attempt to prevent the French from seeking a separate armistice with Germany.

In re Imperial Land Company of Marseilles, ex parte Harris (1872) Law Rep. 7 Ch. App. 587 is an old English contract law case. It reconfirmed the postal rule of "Adams v Lindsell" (1818).
Facts.
Mr Lewis Harris, of 19 Suffolk Street, Dublin, posted a letter applying for shares in the company. It was received by the directors in their Lombard Street office in London. They appointed a committee which allotted 100 shares to him. The company secretary wrote back telling Mr Harris, and that 10% interest would be payable for the price of the shares not yet paid up. Before the letter arrived with Mr Harris, he had sent another letter saying actually, he did not want to accept any shares.
Judgment.
The court held that a contract was complete when the secretary posted the letter accepting the application for shares.
Mellish LJ ascribed the postal rule to the extraordinary and mischievous consequences which would follow if it were held that an offer might be revoked at any time until the letter accepting it had been actually received.
Moreover, where it is expressly or impliedly stated in the offer that you may accept the offer by posting a letter, the moment you post the letter the offer is accepted. You are bound from the moment you post the letter, not, as it is put here, from the moment you make up your mind on the subject.

The Ambassador's Mission

"The Ambassador's Mission" is a fantasy novel that was released on May 6, 2010 in hardback by author Trudi Canavan. It forms part of her Kyralia series and acts as a sequel to The Black Magician Trilogy and the first novel of The Traitor Spy Trilogy. The Ambassador's Mission returns to the themes of the "Black Magician Series", and features Sonea and Lorkin (Sonea and Akkarin's son).
Plot.
Twenty years after the "Ichani Invasion" the Guild has witnessed some major changes. Talented children from all social ranks are now accepted into the Guild even though tensions arise between the various groups. Upon learning the secrets of Black Magic the Rank of Black Magician was created. However, there are some restrictions since the guild is afraid a Black Magician might abuse his or her power. Sonea and the second Black Magician, Kallen, are thus supposed to control each other. Sonea now runs the Hospices which offer free healing to all (as seen at the end of "The High Lord"). Her son Lorkin has graduated and does not yet know what to do with his life. He is intrigued when reading Dannyl's records of old, forgotten magic. Dannyl however wants to visit Sachaka as the Guild's Ambassador and so Lorkin decides to join him which brings tensions to the Guild, some of the members fearing that sending the son of the man who killed so many Sachakans may be seen as an insult. After long discussions Lorkin is allowed to leave with Dannyl.
Meanwhile the Thieves have broken their truce and no longer work together leading to a greater rivalry than before. Even worse, someone starts killing off Thieves; one after the other. When Ceryni's family is killed while he is at a meeting with Faren's successor Skellin, he takes a personal interest in finding the culprit. Upon learning that the "Thief Hunter" uses magic he informs Sonea of the rogue. They decide that if Cery can find her Sonea will trap her and bring her back to the Guild for investigation. They also decide not to inform the Guild fearing a similar unsuccessful manhunt as seen in "The Magicians' Guild".
In Sachaka, Lord Lorkin and Ambassador Dannyl have difficulties adjusting to the fact that there are only slaves and no servants. Lorkin tries to befriend a female slave called Tyvara to learn from her. The Advisor to the King Ashaki Achati introduces them to many important people, some of whom have a lot of information about the history of magic, the Guild and the Sachakan war (which are of great interest to Dannyl and Lorkin). One night, Lorkin wakes up to a woman bedding him and thinking it is Tyvara (to whom he has struck a liking) lets her be. The woman is then surprised and killed (with Black Magic) by Tyvara. Lorkin finds out that there is a mighty rebel organization called “The Traitors” (of which Tyvara is a scout) who are led by women. Fearing further assassination attempts they decide to flee to the “Sanctuary,” the Traitors' headquarter in the Sachakan Mountains to the North. During their travels Lorkin finds out there are two factions of the Traitors which do not agree what to do with him. Twenty-five years previously, Akkarin had learned Black Magic from the Traitors and promised to teach them healing magic (of which the Sachakans have no knowledge). After killing Dakova he fled and thus broke his promise, which led to the death of the Queen’s daughter. This was the reason for one faction wanting to punish Lorkin for his father’s actions, the other wanting to learn healing magic from him. Dannyl, thinking that Lorkin has been kidnapped, decides to follow him and learns a lot about Sachakan culture from his companion Ashaki Achati.
Meanwhile in Imardin Cery has informed his estranged daughter Anyi (from his first marriage) that she might be in danger and has taken her as his bodyguard, so that he can keep an eye upon her without anyone knowing of their relationship. He finds the traitor who to his surprise is a woman of the same race as Skellin. He informs Skellin of his progress and receives a tip on where the woman might be. After informing Sonea and Regin (with whom Sonea is now on speaking terms) they set out to capture the woman, only to realize she is not the rogue they originally discovered. Anyi, who watches the action from a distance, observes the original rogue and informs Sonea who (with the help of two other magicians) manages to capture her. After reading both women's minds, Sonea discovers that the real traitor is Skellin’s mother and the Thief Hunter. The other woman was blackmailed and set up to be caught by Cery. At the hearing, Anyi and Cery were also questioned and Anyi recognizes Black Magician Kallen to be an accomplice of Skellin’s, setting a new mystery to be investigated in “The Rogue”.
In Sachaka, Tyvara and Lorkin meet Speaker Savara and travel to Sanctuary with her. Dannyl and a group of Sachakan Ashaki gain on the Traitors. Dannyl gets deliberately separated from the group and talks to Lorkin, who convinces him to give up since the Traitors would otherwise kill Dannyl. Lorkin then continues on to Sanctuary, where he speaks upon Tyvara’s behalf in the trial held against her for murder. Thanks to Lorkin she is found as not guilty but is confined to Sanctuary. Lorkin, as an outsider, is also confined but is committed to help in some way. As a twist of fate they send him to the sick houses to heal. Lorkin hopes to arrange a deal with the Traitors involving trading some old forgotten magic (like Storestones) for healing magic.

Col di Lana

The Col di Lana is a mountain of the Fanes Group in the Italian Dolomites, situated in Livinallongo del Col di Lana (German: "Buchenstein"), a municipality of the Province of Belluno, in the Italian region of Veneto.
During World War I the mountain, alongside the neighbouring Monte Sief, was the scene of heavy fighting between Austria and Italy. It is now a memorial to the War in the Dolomites.
During the years of 1915/16, Italian troops from 12 infantry and 14 Alpini companies repeatedly attempted to storm the peak, defended first by the German Alpenkorps and later by Austrian regiments. These attempts resulted in heavy losses; 278 Italians died due to avalanches alone. On the 8th of November 1915 the Italians, under the command of Lt. Col. Giuseppe Garibaldi II conquered the summit but then could only mount a weak defence with rag-tag units against a well orchestrated pincer manoeuvre: the top of the Col di Lana fell back to Austrian troops early the next day. A terrible winter then settle in, doing its fair share of killing. However this is not the only reason that the Italians dubbed it ""Col di Sangue"", "Blood Mountain". Like all sides in the First World War, the Italian Army sought to conquer the summit with relatively large forces, paying a high price in casualties.
Lieutenant Caetani of the Italian engineers developed a plan for mining the peak, which was executed silently using hand-operating drilling machines and chisels. The Italians had used a similar method to attack Austrians holding one of Mount Tofano's summits, but while most of the Austrian garrison survived the resulting blast, many Italians were killed by falling boulders and afterdamp. At the start of 1916, the Austrians learned through an artillery observer on Pordoi Pass that the summit had been mined. The Austrians began a counter mine, and exploded this on 5 April 1916. The counter mine was, however, too far away from the Italian explosive tunnel. This was laid with five tonnes of blasting gelatin. On the night of 16/17 April 1916, the 5th Company of the 2nd Tyrolean Kaiserjäger regiment was relieved by the 6th Company, under Oberleutnant Anton von Tschurtschenthaler. The struggle reached its zenith on the night of 17/18 April 1916, when at around 23:30 the summit was blasted. The Austrians under Tschurtschenthaler then had to surrender the mountain; however they were able to maintain a position on Monte Sief, which is linked to Col di Lana by a ridge, which was cut in two by a following Austrian mine, thereby obstructing the Italian breakthrough in the area. 
Today a chapel stands on the summit as a memorial to the soldiers that fell in battle. The remains of a barracks and decaying gun and communications trenches have been left behind from the war. There is also a small war museum on the mountain.
The route is from Pieve di Livinallongo (1,465 m) via the Rifugio Pian della Lasta (1,835 m); there is a road as far as the hut.

Ed O'Callaghan

Ed O'Callaghan is an American Republican lawyer, former co-chief of the terrorism and national security unit of the U.S. Attorney's office in New York, who resigned from the US Attorney's Office in July, 2008 to join John McCain's presidential campaign. One of three leaders of Sarah Palin's Alaska "truth squad," O'Callaghan became the public face of Palin's legal pushback against ethics charges related to her former brother-in-law, the so-called "Troopergate." In March 2009, the law firm Nixon Peabody announced that O'Callaghan had joined its Government Investigations and White Collar Defense Practice Group.
Sarah Palin "truth squad".
O'Callaghan co-leads what the Anchorage Daily News calls "a cadre of high-powered operatives" described by John McCain's campaign as a "truth squad" to field questions about and push back on attacks against vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. (His two co-leaders are Karl Rove protegee Brian Jones and Washington lawyer Mark Paoletta.) 
Paoletta, Jones, and O'Callaghan are "tasked specifically with responding to the sort of viral attacks that have been popping up about Palin’s background and record in Alaska...The public face for this pushback, though, will be woman Republican politicians, a 'truth squad' team designed to highlight attacks on Palin and draw sympathy to her side." Paoletta and Jones are volunteers while O'Callaghan is on staff.
Role in ethics investigation of Sarah Palin.
O'Callaghan was sent to Alaska to handle "legal issues that are affecting the political dynamic of the campaign," according to Taylor Griffin, a former Treasury Department official in the Bush administration. Newsweek describes O'Callaghan's role as "helping to direct an aggressive legal strategy aimed at shutting down a pre-election ethics investigation into Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin." Working with Palin's attorney Thomas Van Flein, O'Callaghan worked to block an investigation by the Alaska Legislative Council, moving consideration of the matter to the Alaska Personnel Board, ("an independent agency composed of members appointed by the Governor," according to Alaska's official website). After filing the ethics complaint with the Alaska Personnel Board, Van Flein and O'Callaghan then moved to have it dismissed on the grounds that there was no "probable cause" for an ethics inquiry. "There was no Ethics Act violation and there is no need to go forward with this," O'Callaghan told reporters.
The Alaska Personnel Board concluded that Palin did not violate the Alaska Executive Ethics Act by trying to get her brother-in-law fired. Alaska Personnel Board investigations are normally secret, but the three-member board chose to release its report one day before the Presidential election.

A67 motorway (Netherlands)

The A67 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands. It is located in the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg.
Overview.
The road is approximately 75 kilometer in length. The A67 motorway connects the Belgian border (A21/E34 road) near Hapert with Eindhoven and the German border (A40 road) near Venlo. Along the entire stretch of the motorway, the European route E34 travels along the A67. Besides, the section near Eindhoven, between interchanges De Hogt and Leenderheide, is shared with the A2 motorway and European route E25.
In the past, traffic from the Eindhoven area towards the German Autobahn A61 had to take exit 41, and then travel along local roads for approximately 7 kilometers before they reached the border and the start of the German A61. Since 4 April 2012, a connection between the Dutch A73 and the German A61 is in operation (the A74), which gives drivers the possibility to travel between the Dutch A67 and the German A61 without having to leave the motorway.

Ulrich Neckel

Ulrich Neckel (23 January 1898 - 11 May 1928) Pour le Mérite, Iron Cross First and Second Class, was a World War I fighter ace credited with 30 victories.
Early Life and Enlistment.
Ulrich Neckel was born in Güstrow, part of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in northeastern Germany. He enlisted aged 18 in an artillery regiment. After extensive service in Russia he then transferred to flying service in November 1916.
Neckel joined FA 25 in early 1917, flying two-seaters on the Eastern Front. Undergoing single seat fighter training in August, He was assigned to Prussian Jagdstaffeln 12 on 8 September 1917 with the rank of Gefreiter.
This unit was one of four in Jagdgeschwader 2 under command of ace Adolf Ritter von Tutschek. On the 21st, Neckel claimed his first victory, a Sopwith Pup of 46 Squadron. A week later, he shot down an Airco D.H.5. A third victory on 18 October followed.
Flying in World War I.
Neckel was privileged during his time with Jasta 12. He had a choice of personal airplanes to fly. Both an Albatros and a Fokker Dr.I triplane bore his personal insignia on white chevrons on the fuselage.
Neckel next achieved a victory on 18 January 1918 and steadily accumulated claims, with his fifth on 26 February. His next victory was over an ace, Lt. John McCudden of 84 Squadron who survived. He scored his tenth on 21 April, making him a 'kanone'.
The twenty-year-old Neckel was now a "Vizefeldwebel" and was commissioned "Leutnant" in April 1918. At about this time, he transferred to Prussian Jasta 13.
June 1918 was Neckel's greatest month, as he notched up eight victories, and added two more in July. On 12 August Neckel was appointed by Jagdgeschwader 2 Commander Rudolf Berthold to provisionally command Jasta 19. The following day saw Neckel's down 29-kill ace Major Charles Dawson Booker. Booker died gallantly, fighting six to one odds to preserve the life of the rookie pilot with him. This was Neckel's 22nd victory.
Neckel proved a competent Jasta commander. On 1 September,Neckel was posted to command Prussian Jasta 6 in the famed Flying Circus of JG 1. His 30th claim, scored on 6 November, would result in the award of the Pour le Mérite on the 8th. It was the penultimate Blue Max awarded in World War I.
Neckel flew a Fokker D.VII with a teddy bear luck charm perched atop his rear view mirror.
In his 30 victories, he was responsible for at least a dozen deaths; yet the twenty-year-old ace sought out and shook hands with his final victim, Lieutenant Ben E. Brown.
Ulrich Neckel survived the war, only to succumb to tuberculosis while in Arco. He was buried in Berlin. He was 30 years old.
In the 1930s, Lufthansa named one of its Junkers 52 passenger airliners after Neckel.

James Starritt

Sir James Starritt KCVO (15 May 1914 – 2000), often known as Jim Starritt, was a British police officer in the London Metropolitan Police.
Starritt was born in Carrigans, a tiny village in the Laggan district of eastern County Donegal, Ireland, the son of a land auctioneer. His family - staunch Ulster Presbyterians - later moved east to the small town of Magherafelt in County Londonderry following the Partition of Ireland. He was educated at the local Rainey School.
He joined the Metropolitan Police as a Constable in 1935 and was first posted to Paddington. In the Second World War he joined the Royal Marines and was later commissioned and served in the Far East, being promoted to Temporary Lieutenant in April 1945 and Acting Temporary Captain in November 1945. After the war he returned to the Metropolitan Police, and was promoted Sergeant in 1947, Inspector in 1952, and Chief Inspector in 1955. He spent almost all of his career in Central London and was a particular expert on the criminal gangs of Soho.
He was Chief Superintendent commanding "C" Division at West End Central in the early 1960s and featured prominently in the 1964 public inquiry into one of his men, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, who continued to work despite having paranoid schizophrenia. Starritt was exonerated of all blame in the case, as Challenor had never been certified as medically unfit for duty. He was promoted Deputy Commander in 1965 and Commander in 1967, working in the force inspectorate.
In 1968, Starritt was appointed Assistant Commissioner "B" (Traffic) and later (probably in early 1970) moved to become Assistant Commissioner "A" (Operations and Administration). In 1972, he was appointed Deputy Commissioner. In this post, he oversaw the internal inquiry into the operations of Special Branch in connection with Kenneth Lennon, an Irish police informant found shot dead in a ditch in Surrey in 1974, which was generally accepted as vindicating the Metropolitan Police. The following year he headed the inquiry into police corruption in Soho which led to the arrests of twelve officers, including two commanders and a chief superintendent. In his autobiography, "In the Office of Constable", Commissioner Sir Robert Mark wrote that Starritt deserved an "honoured place in Metropolitan Police history for putting an end to malpractice that had caused the force incalculable harm for many years".
He was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1973 New Year Honours and Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 1975 Birthday Honours, shortly before his retirement.
