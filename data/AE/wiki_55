Lacksley Castell

Lacksley Castell, sometimes misspelled Laxley, Lacksly, Lasky or Locksley Castel (1959 – 1983) was a Jamaican reggae singer best known for his work in the early 1980s.
Biography.
Lacksley Castell was born in 1959, although some sources claim 1962. Growing up in Kingston's Waterhouse district, along with artists such as Black Uhuru and The Travellers, Lacksley recorded in what was known as the "Waterhouse style". Castell became friends with Hugh Mundell who helped both him and his friend Junior Reid to get started in the music business. That resulted in Castell's first single releases in 1978, "Babylon World" and "Love in Your Heart", recorded with Augustus Pablo. In 1979, he recorded "Jah Love Is Sweeter" at Lee "Scratch" Perry's Black Ark Studios, which was a pre-release reggae chart hit in the United Kingdom in August 1979, with "What a Great Day" (produced by Prince Jammy) making the top five of the reggae 12-inch singles chart the same month.
In 1980, Castell recorded the "Jah Fire" album with Hugh Mundell, produced by Prince Jammy. He also provided backing vocals on Sugar Minott's "Black Roots" album and had a further 12-inch hit with "African Queen" that year. His first solo album, "Morning Glory", was released in 1982 on Robert "Flacko" Palmer's Negus Roots label, who also produced the record. This was followed by a second album, "Princess Lady" in 1983, co-arranged by Dean Fraser and mixed by Neil "Mad Professor" Fraser. Castell was also credited as arranger on fellow Negus Roots artists Sly & Robbie's 1982 album, "Dub Rockers Delight", which consisted of dubs from his "Morning Glory" album. Dubs from the "Princess Lady" album were included on Mad Professor's "In a Rub a Dub Style".
Lacksley died in 1983 of an asthma attack after being weakened by tuberculosis (some sources also claim stomach illness was the cause of Castell's death). His two albums were re-issued on CD in 2005. Lacksley Castell Facebook page exists, maintained by his brother Trevor Castell.

Liverpool and District Cricket Competition

The Liverpool and District Cricket Competition is the top level of competition for recreational club cricket in the Liverpool area and since 2000 has been a designated ECB Premier League. 
The Competition operates a three divisional system with Premier, First and Second Divisions, the Southport and District Amateur Cricket League is its feeder league.
History.
Although many of the district's clubs had met regularly as far back as 1850, or earlier, it was not until 1892 that a Liverpool newspaper began publishing a weekly table and calling it the Liverpool Competition to create more interest in the game.
The eleven senior clubs making up the original table were Birkenhead Park, Bootle, Formby, Huyton, Liverpool, New Brighton, Northern, Ormskirk, Oxton, Rock Ferry and Sefton.
Neston were offered first team fixtures in 1908 and, in 1919, Hightown and Southport and Birkdale joined whilst Wallasey took over the fixtures of the Rock Ferry club who did not resume after the First War. Boughton Hall (later known as Chester Boughton Hall) were invited to join in 1923.
The Competition continued until 1947 when it was decided to admit a sixteenth club and Preston were voted in. Two years later, fixtures were standardised by all clubs agreeing to meet each other, and although there was no suggestion of a league, it was decided to regard the table as official.
Preston resigned at the end of the 1952 season to be replaced by St Helens Recs in 1953.
In recent years, the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition has changed radically. There was an expansion in 1996 that introduced clubs from further afield in Lancashire and North Wales but saw founder members Birkenhead Park, Chester Boughton Hall, Neston and Oxton resign to join the Cheshire County Cricket League for the 1998 season. Of the four, only Oxton had failed to be champions of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition.
In 1999 a two division structure was introduced, and in 2000 the 1st XI Premier Division was awarded ECB Premier League status.
From the end of the 2004 season, promotion from and relegation to the Merseyside and Southport Cricket Alliance feeder league was introduced, but was then curtailed from the end of the 2009 season. At this time, additional clubs from the Alliance were 'invited' to join, to form a new three divisional structure.
Moorfield and Southport Trinity resigned to return to the Merseyside Competition and Southport League respectively for 2012. Birkenhead Park (returning) and Old Xaverians (Merseyside Competition) elected to replace them.
Following the demise of St Helens before the start of the 2012 season, St Helens Recs assumed the name St Helens Town. The Second Division ran with eleven teams.
Spring View from the Bolton and District Cricket Association joined the Second Division in 2013.
2nd XIs play in a similar three divisional structure but independent of the 1st XIs.
There is a two divisional structure for Saturday 3rd XIs and below, with another structure for those clubs preferring to play on Sundays. They have a Premier Division and two First Divisions, North East and South West.

List of coffee beverages

This is a list of coffee beverages, and covers various types of notable coffee beverages.
Affogato.
An affogato (Italian for "drowned") is a coffee-based beverage or dessert. "Affogato style", which refers to the act of topping a drink or dessert with espresso, may also incorporate caramel sauce or chocolate sauce.
Antoccino.
An Antoccino is a single shot of espresso with steamed milk in a 1:1 ratio, served in an espresso cup.
Black Eye.
A Black Eye is dripped coffee with a double shot of espresso. It has a strong taste.
Black Tie.
A traditional Thai Iced Tea, which is a spicy and sweet mixture of chilled black tea, orange blossom water, star anise, crushed tamarind, sugar and condensed milk or cream, with a double shot of espresso.
Breve.
Beverage made with steamed half and half cream
Caffè Americano.
Caffè Americano or simply Americano (the name is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g. Café Americano, Cafe Americano, etc.) is a style of coffee prepared by adding hot water to espresso, giving a similar strength to but different flavor from regular drip coffee. The drink consists of a single or double-shot of espresso combined with between 1 and 16 fluid ounces (30 - 470ml) of hot water. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso added. In the United States, "Americano" is used broadly to mean combining hot water and espresso in either order, but in a narrower definition it refers to adding water "to" espresso (espresso on the bottom), while adding espresso to water (espresso on the top) is instead referred to as a long black.
Variations include:
Café au lait.
A café au lait is traditionally the French way of preparing 'coffee with milk' both at home and in Cafés in Europe. "Café au lait" stems from the same continental tradition as "caffè Latte" in Italy, "café con leche" in Spain, "kawa biała" ("white coffee") in Poland, "Milchkaffee" in Germany, "Mèlange" in Austria, "koffie verkeerd" in Netherlands, and "café com leite" in Portugal, meaning simply "coffee with milk".
In northern Europe, "café au lait" is the name most often used in coffee shops for what other places is a 'caffè latte'.
The term 'café au lait' has been used for espresso + milk since the 1950s in among other places the UK, Netherland, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
In the US, 'café au lait' is defined as a coffee beverage consisting strong or bold coffee (sometimes espresso) mixed with scalded milk in approximately a 1:1 ratio.
Café Bombón.
Cafe Bombon was made popular in Valencia, Spain, and spread gradually to the rest of the country. It might have been re-created and modified to suit European tastebuds as in many parts of Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore the same recipe for coffee which is called "Kopi Susu Panas" (Malaysia) or "Gafeh Rorn" hot coffee (Thailand) has already been around for decades and is very popular in "mamak" stalls and "kopitiams" in Malaysia. A café bombón, however uses espresso served with sweetened condensed milk in a 1:1 ratio whereas the Asian version uses ground coffee and sweetened condensed milk at the same ratio. For café bombón, the condensed milk is added to the espresso. For visual effect, a glass is used, and the condensed milk is added slowly to sink underneath the coffee and create two separate bands of contrasting colour – though these layers are customarily stirred together before consumption. Some establishments merely serve an espresso with a sachet of condensed milk for patrons to make themselves.
Café Cubano.
Café Cubano (Cuban coffee, Cuban espresso, cafecito, Cuban pull, Cuban shot) is a type of espresso which originated in Cuba after espresso machines were first imported there from Italy. Specifically, it refers to an espresso shot which is sweetened with demerara sugar as it is being brewed, but the name covers other drinks that use Cuban espresso as their base.
Drinking café cubano remains a prominent social and cultural activity within Cuba, Miami, West Palm Beach, Tampa and the Keys, as well as the Cuban exile community. Café Cubano is available in almost all coffee shops in Miami, making it a staple of local cuisine and tradition.
Caffè crema.
Caffè crema (Italian: cream coffee) refers to two different coffee drinks:
As a colorful term it generally means "espresso", while in technical discussions, referring to the long drink, it may more narrowly be referred to as "Swiss" caffè crema.
Variant terms include "crema caffè" and the hyperforeignism "café crema" – "café" is French, while "caffè" and "crema" are Italian, thus "café crema" mixes French and Italian.
Café de olla.
Café de olla or "pot coffee" is a traditional coffee-based drink prepared using earthen clay pots or jars in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It is flavored with cinammon and piloncillo. Consumed primarily in colder weathers, usually with the merienda meal, and accompanied with pan dulce pastries.
Caffè latte.
Similar to the Portuguese Galão, a latte is a portion of espresso and steamed milk, generally in a 1:3 to 1:5 ratio of espresso to milk, with a little foam on top.
Caffè Marocchino.
The Marocchino is made from espresso, steamed milk, and a dusting of cocoa powder, similar to the espressino.
Caffè Medici.
A Caffè Medici is a "doppio" poured over chocolate syrup and orange peel, usually topped with whipped cream. The drink originated at Seattle's historic Last Exit on Brooklyn coffeehouse.
Café miel.
A café miel has a shot of espresso, steamed milk, cinnamon, and honey. The name comes from the French word for honey, miel.
Coffee milk.
A coffee milk is a drink similar to chocolate milk; however, instead of chocolate syrup, coffee syrup is used. It is the official state drink of Rhode Island in the United States.
Café mocha.
A café mocha is a variant of a caffè latte. Like a latte, it is typically one third espresso and two thirds steamed milk, but a portion of chocolate is added, typically in the form of a chocolate syrup, although other vending systems use instant chocolate powder. Mochas can contain dark or milk chocolate.
The term moccaccino is used in some regions of Europe and the Middle East to describe caffè latte with cocoa or chocolate. In the U.S. it usually refers to a cappuccino made with chocolate.
A "cafe borgia" is a mocha with orange rind and sometimes orange flavoring added. Often served with whipped cream and topped with cinnamon.
Caffè Tobio.
Caffè Tobio is an espresso drink with an equal amount of regular coffee. This combination simultaneously helps the flavor of weak coffee and hides the bitter flavor of espresso. Useful in chain coffee bars.
Café Touba.
Café Touba is the spiritual beverage of Senegal, named for the holy city of Touba. During the roasting process, the coffee beans are mixed with grains of selim, and sometimes other spices, and ground into powder after roasting. The drink is prepared using a filter, similar to plain coffee. Sugar is often added before drinking.
Cafe Zorro.
A Cafe Zorro is a double espresso, or doppio, added to hot water with a 1:1 ratio.
Ca phe sua da.
Cà phê sữa đá, also known as, cafe sua da () or "V-caf", is a unique Vietnamese coffee recipe. Literally, ca phe sua da means "iced milk coffee". Ca phe sua da can be made simply by mixing black coffee with about a quarter to a half as much sweetened condensed milk and then pouring it over ice. A substitute made by many Vietnamese immigrants in the Southern U.S., particularly in Louisiana is a dark French roast, often with chicory; otherwise an imported Vietnamese-grown and roasted coffee is used when it is available. The coffee is traditionally brewed with a small metal Vietnamese drip filter into a cup containing the condensed milk. The condensed milk and coffee are stirred together and then poured over the ice. Ca phe sua nong (Vietnamese: 'cà phê sữa nóng') — literally, "hot milk coffee" — is made by excluding the ice.
In Spain, there is a similar beverage called Café del Tiempo ( Weather Coffee) or Café con Hielo (Coffee with Ice). Similarly, Café Bombón can be served with ice. The coffee is served in a small cup and an empty small glass with ices cubes. Sugar or condensed milk is added in the small cup while the coffee is still hot, and then the coffee is poured in the small glass with ices. When the coffee is cooled, the remaining ice is removed with the help of a spoon.
Cappuccino.
Cappuccino is a coffee-based drink prepared with espresso, hot milk, and steamed milk foam. A cappuccino differs from a caffè latte in that it is prepared with much less steamed or textured milk than the caffè latte with the total of espresso and milk/foam making up between approximately . A cappuccino usually exceeds the height of the cup, making the foam visible above the side of the cup. A cappuccino is traditionally served in a porcelain cup, which has far better heat retention characteristics than glass or paper. The foam on top of the cappuccino acts as an insulator and helps retain the heat of the liquid, allowing it to stay hotter longer.
Chai Latte.
Numerous houses use the term chai latte to indicate that the steamed milk of a normal cafè latte is being flavoured with a spiced tea concentrate instead of with espresso. Add espresso shots for a "Dirty Chai Latte".
Cold Brew.
Cold brew, or cold-press, refers to the process of steeping coffee grounds in room temperature or cold water for an extended period. It is also sometimes referred to as Toddy coffee which is a trademarked cold brewing system. The cold brew process requires grinding. Coarse-ground beans are soaked in water for a prolonged period of time, usually 12 hours or more. The water is normally kept at room temperature, but chilled water can also be used. The grounds must be filtered out of the water after they have been steeped using a paper coffee filter, a fine metal sieve, a French press or felt, in the case of the Toddy system. The result is a coffee concentrate that is often diluted with water or milk, and can be served hot, over ice, or blended with ice and other ingredients such as chocolate. Cold brewed coffee naturally seems sweeter due to its lower acidity. It is around 65-70% less acidic than hot drip coffee or espresso. Because the coffee beans in cold brew coffee never come into contact with heated water, the process of leaching flavor from the beans produces a chemical profile different from conventional brewing methods.
Cold brew coffee is not to be confused with iced coffee, which can refer to coffee that is brewed hot and then chilled by pouring over or adding ice.
Cortado.
A cortado is an espresso (also known as "Pingo" or "Garoto") "cut" (from the Spanish and Portuguese cortar) with a small amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity. The ratio of milk to coffee is between 1:1 – 1:2, and the milk is added after the espresso. The steamed milk hasn't much foam, but many baristas make some micro foam to make latte art. It is popular in Spain and Portugal, in Norway as well as throughout Latin America, where it is drunk in the afternoon. In Cuba, it is known as a cortadito. It's usually served in a special glass, often with a metal ring base and a metal wire handle. There are several variations, including cortado condensada (espresso with condensed milk) and leche y leche (with condensed milk and cream on top). In the United States it is sometimes known as a "Gibraltar".
Differs from Cappuccino with little or no milk foam, and from Flat White in that the Flat White is always prepared with a double espresso and no foam.
Decaf.
A coffee beverage made with decaffeinated beans.
Chai tea with a single shot of espresso. In addition, 1-2 tablespoons of instant Espresso may be brewed while simultaneously steeping Chai in the same container; a small amount of a dairy or non-dairy beverage of choice is usually added to complete the drink.
Doppio.
Doppio in espresso is a double shot, extracted using a double filter basket in the portafilter.
Eggnog Latte.
An autumn and winter seasonal blend of steamed milk and eggnog, plus espresso and a pinch of nutmeg.
Eiskaffee.
Eiskaffee, literally "ice cream coffee", is a popular German drink consisting of chilled coffee, milk, sweetener, vanilla ice cream, and sometimes whipped cream.
Espressino.
An espressino is made from espresso, steamed milk, and cocoa powder, similar to the Marocchino
Espresso.
Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water — about — under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso often has a thicker consistency than coffee brewed by other methods, a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and "crema" (meaning "cream", but being a reference to the foam with a creamy texture that forms as a result of the pressure). As a result of the pressurized brewing process the flavours and chemicals in a typical cup of coffee are very concentrated. Espresso is the base for other drinks, such as a latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, or americano. Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most beverages, but the usual serving size is smaller—a typical 60 mL (2 US fluid ounce) of espresso has 80 to 150 mg of caffeine, little less than the 95 to 200 mg of a standard 240 mL (8 US fluid ounces) cup of drip-brewed coffee.
Espresso Romano.
An Espresso Romano is a shot of espresso with a small rind of lemon and sugar added to it.
Frozen coffee drink.
A frozen coffee drink is a blended iced coffee beverage sold under various names.
Flat white.
A flat white is an espresso coffee with a similar proportion of coffee to milk as a caffè latte and a cappuccino, the main difference being the texture of the milk and (in some regions) the number of espresso shots.
The drink originated in Australia and New Zealand in the late 1970s as alternative to the frothier cappuccino. It has since spread to the UK, where it first began to be served by independent cafes in London like Department of Coffee and Social Affairs, and Speak Easy, where owners and staff are from New Zealand, bring the style of coffee into the UK before being adopted by chains Costa and Starbucks. It is rarely found in continental Europe or the United States.
In New Zealand it is traditionally made with two shots of espresso topped with stretched and texturised milk. The milk is prepared by steaming air into the milk and folding the top layer into the lower layers. To achieve the "flat", non-frothy texture the steamed milk is poured from the bottom of the jug, holding back the lighter froth on the top in order to access milk with smaller bubbles, making the drink smooth and velvety in texture. This leads to a white coffee with the crema on top still intact. The drink was traditionally served in a ceramic cup used for cappuccinos (approximately 220-260ml in capacity), though present-day speciality cafes are more likely to serve it in smaller (150-160ml) cups with two Ristretto shots used, resulting in a drink noticeably stronger and less milky than a caffè latte.
Outside New Zealand, the milk is prepared in a manner more similar to that of a caffè latte; the milk is stretched and texturised but is poured freely rather than the froth being held back with a spoon or knife. This results in a thicker density of milk with more froth.
In Australia the drink more closely resembles a caffè latte as it tends to be served with a single shot of coffee, resulting in a weaker and milkier drink.
In the United Kingdom the drink has a similar strength to the New Zealand version. It is made in a small cup (150-160ml), contains two espresso (often ristretto) shots, and is often finished with latte art. The skill needed in preparing ristretto shots and latte art means that it is viewed as somewhat of a speciality product in the UK.
Galão.
Galão is a hot drink from Portugal made of espresso and foamed milk. In all similar to caffè latte or café au lait, it comes in a tall glass with about one quarter coffee, 3 quarters foamed milk. When the proportion is 1:1 it is called "meia de leite" (Chinesa in Madeira) and it comes in a Coffee cup.
Guillermo.
Originally, one or two shots of hot espresso, poured over slices of lime it can also be served on ice, sometimes with a touch of milk.
Greek frappé coffee.
Greek frappé (Café frappé) () is a foam-covered iced coffee drink made from spray-dried instant coffee. It is very popular in Greece especially during summer, but has now spread on to other countries.
There are numerous ways in which this coffee can be tailored to the individual's taste such as: 1.all water-no milk; 2.half-half; 3.all milk and; 4.varying levels of sweetness. Frappe is also extremely popular in the country of Cyprus where fresh milk is used as opposed to condensed.
In French, when describing a drink, the word frappé means shaken and/or chilled; however, in popular Greek culture, the word frappé is predominantly taken to refer to the shaking associated with the preparation of a café frappé.
Green Eye.
A Green Eye (also known as "Triple Death") is drip brewed dark-roast coffee with a triple shot of espresso.
Half-caf.
Beverage made with half and half parts caffeinated beans and decaffeinated beans.
Iced coffee.
Iced coffee is a cold variant of the normally hot beverage coffee.
Indian filter coffee.
South Indian Coffee, also known as Madras Filter Coffee or Kaapi (Tamil phonetic rendering of "coffee') is a sweet milky coffee made from dark roasted coffee beans (70%–80%) and chicory (20%–30%), especially popular in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The most commonly used coffee beans are Peaberry (preferred), Arabica, Malabar and Robusta grown in the hills of Kerala (Malabar region), Karnataka (Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru) and Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris District,Yercaud and Kodaikanal).
Instant coffee.
Instant coffee is a beverage derived from brewed coffee beans. Through various manufacturing processes the coffee is dehydrated into the form of powder or granules. These can be rehydrated with hot water to provide a drink similar (though not identical) to conventional coffee. At least one brand of instant coffee is also available in concentrated liquid form.
Irish Coffee.
Irish coffee is coffee combined with whiskey and cream, often further sweetened with sugar. Also available as a flavor of ice cream.
Kopi susu.
Kopi susu is found in (at least) Malaysia, Borneo and Indonesia and very similar to the preceding entry for Ca phe sua nong. Literally, kopi susu means "milk coffee". Served in a glass, kopi susu can be made simply by mixing black coffee (arabica) with about a quarter to half a glass of sweetened condensed milk then let stand to cool and allow the grounds to sink to the bottom. You should not drink this to the end unless you want to "eat" the ground coffee. Kopi Turbruk is as above but uses sugar instead of sweetened condensed milk.
Latte macchiato.
Latte macchiato literally means "stained milk". This refers to the method of preparation, wherein the milk gets "stained" by the addition of espresso. It differs significantly from caffè latte firstly in that espresso is added to milk (rather than milk to espresso), secondly that it features more foam, rather than simply hot milk, thirdly in that often only ½ (or less) of an espresso shot is used, and fourthly in that it is often a "layered" drink, rather than being mixed as in a caffè latte. Simply, in a caffè latte, the emphasis is on the coffee, while in a latte macchiato, the emphasis is on the milk.
Liqueur coffee.
A liqueur coffee, as its name suggests, is a coffee brew with a 25 ml shot of liqueur. This brew is usually served in a clear, clean, pre-heated, liqueur coffee glass with the coffee and cream separated for good visual and taste effect. The liqueur of choice is added first with a teaspoon of raw cane sugar mixed in. The glass is then filled to within an inch of the top with good, strong, fresh filter coffee. Fresh, chilled, additive free, slightly whipped cream is then poured carefully over the back of a cold teaspoon, so that it floats on top of the coffee and liqueur mixture. The sugar is required in the coffee mixture to help the cream float.
Macchiato.
Caffè macchiato Macchiato, meaning 'stained', is an Espresso with a dash of foamed milk. At first sight it resembles a small Cappuccino, but even if the ingredients are the same as those used for Cappuccino, a Macchiato has a much stronger and aromatic taste.The milk is foamed directly into the espresso cup, which is then put under the coffee outlet. The espresso is then drawn into the cup. Cocoa is then sprinkled over the drink (optional). Often the process is reversed and milk foam is floated on top of extracted coffee.
A long Macchiato will have two shots of espresso and a small amount of hot water (as per long black). A short Macchiato will usually have one shot of coffee and less water (as per short black).
Mazagran.
Mazagran (sometimes misspelled as Mazagrin) is a long cold coffee beverage usual in Portugal and served in a tall glass. It is made with at least strong coffee - usually espresso - lemon and ice, though sometimes sugar, rum or water is added. Sometimes a fast version is achieved by pouring a previously sweetened espresso in a cup with ice cubes and a slice of lemon.
Mélange.
Mélange is popular in Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, and is traditionally similar to caffè latte and cappuccino (and more a mix of the two), a large cup with (today) espresso and steamed milk with some milk foam.
Mélange and its 'cousin' cappuccino both have variations with whipped cream atop the blend of milk and coffee. Outside Vienna this is sometimes referred to as 'Wiener Melange', although that name does not exist there.
The origin of Mèlange goes back to the 1700s as a Café drink (you wouldn't call it that at home) in Austria.
Moka pot coffee.
Moka coffee is coffee brewed with a moka pot, a stove-top coffee maker which produces coffee by passing hot water pressurized by steam through ground coffee in a lower pressure than an espresso maker. The flavor of moka pot coffee depends greatly on bean variety, roast level, fineness of grind, and the level of heat used. Due to the higher than atmospheric pressure involved, the mixture of water and steam reaches temperatures well above 100 °C, causing a more efficient extraction of caffeine and flavors from the grounds, and resulting in a stronger brew than that obtained by drip brewing.
Palazzo.
A Palazzo is an iced coffee variant, popular in Southern California. It is two shots of espresso, chilled immediately after brewing and mixed with sweetened cream. A Palazzo is typically made using a moka pot.
Pharisäer.
A Pharisäer, meaning a Pharisee, is an alcoholic coffee beverage that is popular in the Nordfriesland district of Germany. It consists of a mug of black coffee, a double shot of rum, and a topping of whipped cream. In 1981, a court in Flensburg ruled that of rum were not sufficient for preparing a genuine Pharisäer.
Pocillo.
A shot or small portion of unsweetened coffee, now usually made either using an espresso machine or a moka pot, but traditionally made using a cloth drip, usually served in cups made for the purpose (called ""tazitas de pocillo""). It is widely-drunk in Latin America, usually as an afternoon or after-dinner coffee. The defining feature is the size, usually half size to a quarter size of the usual ~ coffee cups. There are a number of small-sized drinks that use "tazitas de pocillo", including sweetened (such as "café cubano" and "café cortado"), but these are usually not called a "pocillo"; rather, the Spanish diminutive suffix "-ito" is usually added to the name of the drink wanted in a "pocillo" size cup. For example, a "pocillo"-sized "cortado" is usually called a "cortadito".
Red Eye.
A Red Eye is dripped coffee with a single shot of espresso. This drink is also known as a Shot in the Dark.
Red Tie.
A traditional Thai Iced Tea, which is a spicy and sweet mixture of chilled black tea, orange blossom water, star anise, crushed tamarind, sugar and condensed milk or cream, with a single shot of espresso.
Red Tux.
A Zebra Mocha combined with raspberry flavoring.
Ristretto.
Ristretto is a very "short" shot of espresso coffee. Originally this meant pulling a hand press faster than usual using the same amount of water as a regular shot of espresso. Since the water came in contact with the grinds for a much shorter time the caffeine is extracted in reduced ratio to the flavorful coffee oils. The resultant shot could be described as bolder, fuller, with more body and less bitterness. All of these flavors are usually attributed to espresso in general, but are more pronounced in ristretto. Today, with the hand press out of favor and modern automated machines generally less controllable, ristretto usually just means less water; a double espresso shot is typically around 60 ml (2 fl oz), while a double ristretto is typically 45 ml (1–1.5 fl oz).
Rüdesheimer kaffee.
Rüdesheimer kaffee is an alcoholic coffee drink from Rüdesheim in Germany invented in 1957 by Hans Karl Adam. It is made with Asbach Uralt brandy with coffee and sugar, and is topped with whipped cream.
Turkish coffee.
Beans for Turkish coffee are ground or pounded to the finest possible powder, finer than for any other way of preparation.
Preparation of Turkish coffee consists of immersing the coffee grounds in water which is most of the time hot but not boiling for long enough to dissolve the flavour some compounds. While prolonged boiling of coffee gives it an unpleasant "cooked" or "burnt" taste, very brief boiling does not, and bringing it to the boil shows without guesswork that it has reached the appropriate temperature.
In Turkey, four degrees of sweetness are used. The Turkish terms and approximate amounts are as follows: sade (plain; no sugar), az şekerli (little sugar; half a level teaspoon of sugar), orta şekerli (medium sugar; one level teaspoon), and çok şekerli (a lot of sugar; one and a half or two level teaspoons). The coffee and the desired amount of sugar are stirred until all coffee sinks and the sugar is dissolved. Following this, the spoon is removed and the pot is put on moderate heat; if too high, the coffee comes to the boil too quickly, without time to extract the flavour. No stirring is done beyond this point, as it would dissolve the foam. Just as the coffee comes to the boil the pot is removed from the heat. It is usually kept off the heat for a short time, then brought to the boil a second and a third time, then the coffee is poured into the cups. Getting the thickest possible layer of foam is considered the peak of the coffee maker's art. One way to maximize this is to pour slowly and try to lift the pot higher and higher as the pouring continues. Regardless of these techniques, getting the same amount of foam into all cups is hard to achieve, and the cup with the most foam is considered the best of the lot.
Slight variations to this coffee exist in neighboring countries most notably: Greek coffee and Cypriot coffee.
Vienna coffee.
A "Vienna coffee" is the name of a popular traditional cream based coffee beverage. It is made by preparing two shots of espresso in a standard sized coffee cup and infusing the coffee with whipped cream (as a replacement for milk and sugar) until the cup is full. Then the cream is twirled and optionally topped off with chocolate sprinklings. The coffee is drunk through the cream top.
White Coffee.
Ipoh "White" Coffee is a popular coffee drink which originated in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia. The coffee beans are roasted with palm-oil margarine, and the resulting coffee is served with condensed milk. The taste is smooth and sweet, and is often served iced.
Wiener Melange.
A Wiener Melange is a specialty coffee drink similar to a cappuccino. The difference is sometimes assumed to be that the "Melange" is made with milder coffee but the Viennese coffee company Julius Meinl describes a "Wiener Melange" as "One small espresso served in a large cup of coffee. Steam milk and add milk foam to coffee (=small milk coffee)". Cafe Sabarsky in Manhattan concurs. At Cafe Sperl in Vienna, the "Melange" is 1/2 cup "black coffee" and 1/2 cup creamy milk, completed by milk foam.
Yuanyang.
Yuanyang, sometimes also called Ying Yong, is a popular beverage in Hong Kong, made of a mixture of coffee and Hong Kong-style milk tea. It was originally served at "dai pai dang"s (open space food vendors) and "cha chaan teng"s (cafe), but is now available in various types of restaurants. It can be served hot or cold. The name yuanyang, which refers to mandarin ducks, is a symbol of conjugal love in Chinese culture, as the birds usually appear in pairs and the male and female look very different. This same connotation of "pair" of two unlike items is used to name this drink.

San Telmo Island is an island forming the west side of Shirreff Cove on the north-west coast of Ioannes Paulus II Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. It has a surface area of .
History.
Named by the UK-APC in 1958 after the Spanish vessel "San Telmo" commanded by Captain Rosendo Porlier, which was the flagship of a Spanish naval squadron bound for Callao (Peru) to reinforce colonial forces there fighting the independence movements in Spanish America. Very severe weather was encountered in Drake Passage in about 61S, 60W, but hawser after hawser parted and she was ultimately left to her fate in about 62S. Some of her spars and her anchor-stock were found by sealers on nearby Half Moon Beach in about 1821.

McClelland College

McClelland College, is a secondary school in Karingal. The school resides in the suburb of Frankston located in Victoria, Australia. The school has received a lot of government funding for their research into new learning environments and for their new VCE centre.
Previously known as Karingal Park Secondary College, the school was created after a merger of two other secondary colleges in the same area, Karingal Secondary College (formerly Karingal High School) and Ballam Park Secondary College (formerly Ballam Park Technical College). Karingal High School was originally located in the Life Saving Club in Frankston, during the 1950s, before relocating to the suburb of Karingal.
In 2009 Karingal Park Secondary College changed its name to McClelland Secondary College, although it was also known as McClelland College by the community. This decision was taken by the staff of the school and the local council. This led to a change in the school's uniform, and the school's colours are now purple and grey.
School uniforms.
The school uniform was chosen by the College Council after a consultative process with the student body. It has been described as conservative and distinctive, and originally included the option of a blazer, but this was not taken up by the vast majority. During summer months, in terms 1 and 4, girls wear a summer dress, grey socks, and black shoes, with a purple college jumper. Boys also wear grey socks and black shoes, and the purple college jumper, in combination with grey trousers or shorts and a white shirt. For winter dress, in terms 2 and 3, girls wear the white college shirt and either a grey skirt or trousers with a college tie. Boys are permitted to wear trousers or shorts during winter, and must also wear a tie.
The college enforces its uniform policy rigorously. As the first uniform policy for McClelland College was white socks, they then changed it to grey socks and enforce this rule strongly.

Green jack

The green jack, "Caranx caballus" (also known as the horse jack), is an abundant species of coastal marine fish in the jack family Carangidae. The species is distributed in the eastern Pacific Ocean along the American coastline from Santa Cruz Island off California in the north to Peru in the south, as well as a number of islands including the Galapagos and recently, Hawaii. The green jack is distinguished from other similar carangid species by a number of features including gill raker and lateral line scale counts, and the presence of an adipose eyelid. It is a moderately large species, growing to at least 55 cm in length and 2.81 kg, although unconfirmed reports suggest a much larger maximum size. It lives in a wide range of continental shelf environments including estuaries, bays, reefs and offshore seamounts, living both pelagically and demersally. The green jack is a predatory species, preying on a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, as well as zooplankton. Most fish are sexually mature by the time they attain 38 cm, with spawning occurring between May and October. The species is of high importance to fisheries throughout its range, caught by pelagic trawls, a variety of netting methods and hook and line. The green jack is also of interest to anglers, taken by bait and lures, although is considered to only be fair in eating quality.
Taxonomy and naming.
The green jack is formally classified within the genus "Caranx", one of a number of groups of fish referred to as jacks and trevallies. "Caranx" is further classified in the family Carangidae, itself part of the suborder Percoidei and the order Perciformes; the perch-like fishes.
The species was first scientifically described by the French biologist Charles Frédéric Girard in 1858, who named the species "Trachurus boops", placing the species in the horse mackerel genus based on the holotype taken off of San Diego, California.
With the instability of carangid taxonomy at the time, the species was reassigned to a number of genera, including "Caranx", which created a taxonomic homonym with the "Caranx boops" described by Georges Cuvier in 1833. In 1868, British zoologist Albert Günther unaware of the prior naming independently renamed the species "Caranx caballus" based on specimens collected from Panama, one of which was designated to be the holotype. The species was further renamed in 1870 by Franz Steindachner, who attempted to remove the "Caranx boops" homonym by simply renaming the species "Caranx girardi". Later reviews of the Carangidae revealed this synonymy, and due to Gunther's' earlier naming, his species name was kept and attributed to him, while Cuvier's' "Caranx boops" was later moved to "Selar boops". The specific name "caballus" is Latin for 'horse', reflecting the common name of horse mackerel given to this and many similar species at the time. William Smith-Vaniz has suggested the possibility "C. caballus" is conspecific with a very similar Atlantic species; "Caranx crysos", but no studies into this relationship have been undertaken. Its position in the genus "Caranx" has also been questioned recently by John Randall due to its unusual dentition. The common name 'green jack' is in reference to the species' common coloration, while 'horse jack' is derived from the Latin name. In Spanish-speaking nations, it is often known under broadly applied names including "cocinero" and "caballa".
Description.
The green jack is moderately large in size, growing to a maximum confirmed length of 55 cm and 2.81 kg in weight. Unconfirmed reports indicate the species may grow much larger; up to 1 m in size, but it is most commonly seen at lengths below 40 cm. The green jack is morphologically similar to a number of other carangids, having an elongated, moderately compressed fusiform body with dorsal and ventral profiles of approximately equal convexity and a slightly pointed snout. The posterior section of the eye is covered by a moderately well developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under the center of the eye. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of 8 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 22 to 25 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 16 to 21 soft rays. The lobes of both the second dorsal and anal fin are slightly elongated and almost entirely covered in small scales, but are still much shorter than the head length. The lateral line has a pronounced but short anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the spine of the second dorsal fin. The straight section contains 0 to 7 scales followed by 42 to 56 very strong scutes, and 43 to 47 scales overall. The chest is completely scaled. The upper jaw contains an irregular series of outer canines with an inner band of small, regularly spaced teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single band of small teeth. The species has 40 to 45 gill rakers in total; 10 to 15 on the upper limb and 27 to 30 on the lower limb, with this the only feature that differs between "C. caballus" and "C. crysos". There are 25 vertebrae present.
In life, the green jack has a greenish blue colour overall, with an olive green to dark blue back and a golden to grey coloured belly, with a distinct back blotch on the outer edge of the operculum. Individuals in schools often have a very evident pearly white marking near this black blotch. Juveniles have 7 dark vertical stripes on their flanks which fade with age. The caudal fin is grey with dark tips, with all other fins being light grey to hyaline in colour.
Distribution and habitat.
The green jack is distributed throughout the coastal waters of the tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends along the coast of the Americas from Santa Cruz Island, California, south through Mexico and Central America, and down to Peru. The species also inhabits a number of offshore islands including the Galápagos Islands. The species had been captured on occasion from the Hawaiian Islands since 1923, but was misidentified until William Smith-Vaniz re-examined the specimens in 1981 and identified them as "Caranx caballus". Due to the heavy fishing pressures throughout Hawaii and the rarity of captures, it was concluded these few individuals were strays carried by ocean currents from the eastern Pacific, as these were the only known specimens. In 1998 however, the species appeared in fishermen's catches in large numbers, and has ever since, indicating a population has been established in the island chain.
The green jack inhabits a variety of continental shelf environments to a depth of at least 100 m, predominantly inshore reef systems, as well as shallow bays, estuaries and lagoons. It leads both a demersal and pelagic lifestyle, forming large schools which can move large distances offshore, allowing them to reach offshore island as well as deep, isolated seamounts.
Biology.
Reproduction in the species has been quite well studied, with the commercial value of the species having led to a number of growth and population dynamics studies being undertaken. Spawning appears to take place from May to October, with peaks in June and October. Larval growth has been extensive described, with the larvae identifiable by their pigmentation pattern and meristic count of 25 vertebrae. The body shape of early larvae resembles that of "Chloroscombrus orquetu", however, differences in pigmentation, particularly on the dorsal body margin, differentiate the species Studies off the coast of Mexico have found the larvae tend to occur in deeper waters than most other carangid larvae inhabit, from 90 to 100 m depth, possibly indicating spawning occurs in deeper waters. Otolith studies indicate that both the females and males grow at the same rate; 16.82 cm after the first year, 27.78 after the second, 34.66 after the third, with modelling suggesting the maximum length of 55 cm is reached at around 8 years of age. Most individuals reach sexual maturity before they reach 38 cm in length. Juveniles tend to move to protected waters such as estuaries, moving to deeper waters at adulthood.
Relationship to humans.
The green jack is one of the most abundant species of fish within its range, and as such is quite important to fisheries throughout its range. It is taken by pelagic trawls, inshore gill nets, purse nets, and seines, as well as hook and line gear. Catch statistics are not kept for the fish throughout most of its range; however, the Mexican state of Colima is one exception. Records from 1980 onward show a catch between 9 and 250 tons, with an average of 93 tons, with the catch best between September and December. Like most carangid species in the area, it is considered a lower class product, fetching between US$ 0.50 and 0.80 per kilogram, making it accessible to the low-income population. The fish are sold both for consumption and as bait, either fresh, smoked or salted. Some hope the Hawaiian population becomes commercially viable in the future, as they are often landed in other carangid catches at the present. 
The green jack is also of modest interest to anglers in the region, with the species a good light-tackle fish. Lures are most often used on the species, including jigs, spoons, and squids, although baits of live fish and strip baits work equally as well.

Grevillea didymobotrya

Grevillea didymobotrya is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. It is endemic to south-western Western Australia. 
It grows to between 1 and 3 metres in height and produces flowers between August and December (late winter to early summer) in its native range.
The infloresences are cream or yellow terminal racemes. The leaves are 1 to 12 cm long and 1 to 9 mm wide.
The species was first formally described by Carl Meissner in "Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis" in 1856, from material collected by James Drummond. Two subspecies are currently recognised: 
subsp. "didymobotrya" and subsp. "involuta".

<doc id="19619363" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19619363" title="Censorship in Italy">
Censorship in Italy

Italy has one of the lowest levels of press freedom in Europe. A 2009 report by Freedom House classified Italy as "partly free", ranking it behind most former communist states of eastern Europe.
Censorship is applied in television such as in press for several rationales.
Censorship in Italy under Fascism (1922-1944).
Censorship in Italy was not created with Fascism, nor did it end with it, but it had heavy influence in the life of Italians under the Regime.
The main goals were, concisely:
Censorship fought ideological and defeatist contents, and any other work or content that could enforce disturbing cultural themes.
Censorship in public communications.
This branch of the activity was mainly ruled by the "Ministero della Cultura Popolare" (Ministry of popular culture), commonly abbreviated as Min. Cul.Pop. (with a weird assonance). This administration had competence on all the contents that could appear in newspapers, radio, literature, theatre, cinema, and generally any other form of communication or art.
In literature, editorial industries had their own controlling servants steadily on site, but sometimes it could happen that some texts reached the libraries and in this case an efficient organization was able to capture all the copies in a very short time.
An important note deserves the question of foreign languages: with the "Autarchia" (the general maneuver for self-sufficiency) they had been banned, and any attempt to use a non-Italian word resulted in a formal censoring action. Reminiscences of this ban could be detected in the dubbing of all foreign movies broadcast on RAI (Italian state owned public service broadcaster): captioning is very rarely used.<br> 
Censorship did not however impose heavy limits on foreign literature, and many of the foreigner authors were freely readable. Those authors could freely frequent Italy and even write about it, with no reported troubles.
In 1930 it was forbidden to distribute books that contained Marxist, Socialist or Anarchist like ideologies, but these books could be collected in public libraries in special sections not open to the general public. The same happened for the books that were sequestrated. All these texts could be read under authorization for scientific or cultural purposes, but it is said that this permission was quite easy to obtain. In 1938 there were public bonfires of forbidden books, enforced by fascists militias ("camicie nere"): any work containing themes about Jewish culture, freemasonry, communist, socialist ideas, were removed also by libraries (but it has been said that effectively the order was not executed with zeal, being a very unpopular position of the Regime). To avoid police inspections, many librarians preferred to hide or privately sell the texts, which in many cases were found at the end of the war .
Censorship and press.
It has been said that Italian press self-censored itself before the censorship commission could do it. Effectively the actions against press were formally very few, but it has been noted that due to press hierarchical organization, the regime felt to be quite safe, controlling it by the direct naming of directors and editors through the ""Ordine dei Giornalisti"".
Most of the intellectuals that after the war would have freely expressed their anti-fascism, were however journalists during fascism, and quite comfortably could find a way to work in a system in which news directly came from the government (so-called "veline", by the tissue-paper used for making as much copies as possible using type-writers with carbon paper) and only had to be adapted to the forms and the styles of each respective target audience.
Newer revisionists talk about a servility of journalists, but are surprisingly followed in this concept by many other authors and by some leftist ones too, since the same suspect was always attributed to Italian press, before, during and after the Ventennio, and still in recent times the category has not completely demonstrated yet its independence from "strong powers". A well known Italian journalist writer, Ennio Flaiano, certainly an anti-fascist, used to say that journalists don't need to care of "that irrelevant majority of Italians".
Independent (illegal) press used clandestine print and distribution, and were mainly connected with the activities of local political groups.
The control on legitimate papers was practically operated by faithful civil servants at the printing machines and this allows reporting a common joke affirming that any text that could reach readers had been "written by the "Duce" and approved by the foreman".
Fascist censorship promoted papers with wider attention to mere chronology of delicate political moments, to distract public opinion from dangerous passages of the government. Press then created "monsters" or focused on other terrifying figures (murderers, serial killers, terrorists, pedophiles, etc.). When needed, an image of a safe ordered State was instead to be stressed, then police were able to capture all the criminals and, as a famous topic says, trains were always in perfect time. All these maneuvers were commonly directed by MinCulPop directly.
After fascism, democratic republic did not change the essence of the fascist law on press, which is now organized as it was before, like the law on access to the profession of journalist remained unaltered.
About satire and related press, Fascism was not more severe, and in fact a famous magazine, "Marc'Aurelio", was able to live with little trouble. In 1924-1925, during the most violent times of fascism (when squads used brutality against opposition) with reference to the death of Giacomo Matteotti killed by fascists, "Marc'Aurelio" published a series of heavy jokes and "comic" drawings describing dictator Benito Mussolini finally distributing peace; eternal peace, in this case. Marc'Aurelio however would have turned to a more integrated tone during the following years and in 1938 (the year of the racial laws) published tasteless anti-Semitic contents.
Censorship in private communications.
Quite obviously, any telephone call was at risk of being intercepted and, sometimes, interrupted by censors.
Not all the letters were opened, but not all those read by censors had the regular stamp that recorded the executed control. Most of the censorship was probably not declared, to secretly consent further police investigations.
Chattering "en plein air" was indeed very risky, as a special section of investigators dealt with what people was saying on the roads; an eventual accusation by some policeman in disguise was evidently very hard to disprove and many people reported of having been falsely accused of anti-national sentiments, just for personal interests of the spy. Consequently, after the first cases, people commonly avoided talking publicly.
Military censorship.
The greatest amount of documents about fascist censorship comes from the military commissions for censorship.
This is also due to some facts: first of all the war had brought many Italians far from their houses, creating a need for writing to their families that previously did not exist. Secondarily, in a critic situation as a war can be, obviously military authorities were compelled to a major activity to control eventual internal oppositions, spies or (most important) defeatists. Finally, the result of the war could not allow fascists to hide or delete these documents (which it is supposed might have happened for other ones before the war), that remained in public offices where they were found by occupying troops. So we can now read thousands of letters that soldiers sent to their families, and these documents revealed as a unique resource for sociology (and general knowledge about those times).
The work was daily organized, resumed and composed in a note that daily was received by Mussolini or his apparatus and by the other major authorities.
Notes reported, i.e., what soldiers could think about relevant events, what was the opinion in Italy, similar arguments.
Italians reaction against censorship.
The fact that Italians were well aware of the fact that any communication could be intercepted, recorded, analyzed and eventually used against them, caused that censorship in time became a sort of usual rule to consider, and soon most people used jargons or other conventional systems to overtake the rules. Opposition was expressed in satiric ways or with some geniously studied legal tricks, one of which was to sing publicly the Hymn of Sardinia, which should have been forbidden not being in Italian language, but it could not be forbidden being one of the symbols of the Savoy house.
It has to be said that in most of the small villages, life continued as before, since the local authorities used a very familiar style in executing such orders. Also in many urban realities, civil servants used little zeal and more humanity. But the general effect was indeed relevant.
In theatre censorship caused a revival of "canovaccio" and Commedia dell'arte: given that all the stories had to obtain a prior permission before being performed, stories were summarized and officially were improvisations on a given theme.
Modern censorship in Italy.
One of the most important cases of censorship in Italy was the banning of one episode of the TV show "Le Iene" showing use of cocaine in the Italian Parliament.
As with all the other media of Italy, the Italian television industry is widely considered both inside and outside the country to be overtly politicized. According to a December 2008 poll, only 24% of Italians trust television news programmes, compared unfavourably to the British rate of 38%, making Italy one of only three examined countries where online sources are considered more reliable than television ones for information.
Italy put an embargo on foreign bookmakers over the Internet (in violation of EU market rules) by mandating certain edits to DNS host files of Italian ISPs. Italy is also blocking access to websites containing child pornography.
Advertisements promoting "Videocracy", a Swedish documentary examining the influence of television on Italian culture over the last 30 years, was refused airing purportedly because it says the spots are an offense to Premier Silvio Berlusconi.
Movies or anime and cartoons are often modified or cut on national television networks such as Mediaset or RAI. An example of this occurred in December 2008, when "Brokeback Mountain" was aired on Rai 2 during prime time. Several scenes featuring mildly sexual (or even just romantic) behavior of the two protagonists were cut. This act was severely criticized by Italian LGBT activist organizations and others.
The "Report" case.
In 2009, the board of state television RAI cut funds for legal assistance to the investigative journalism TV program "Report" (aired by Rai 3, a state-owned channel). The program had tackled sensitive issues in the past that exposed the journalists to legal action (for example the authorization of buildings that did not meet earthquake-resistance specifications, cases of overwhelming bureaucracy, the slow process of justice, prostitution, health care scandals, bankrupt bankers secretly owning multi-million-dollar paintings, waste mismanagement involving dioxine toxic waste, cancers caused by asbestos anti-fire shieldings (Eternit) and environmental pollution caused by a coal power station near the city of Taranto). An accumulation of lawsuits against the journalists in the absence of the funds to handle them could bring the program to an end.
"Freedom of the Press" report.
Before 2004, in the "Freedom of the Press" report, published by the American organization Freedom House, Italy had always been classified as "Free" (regarding the freedom of press). In 2004, it was demoted to "Partly Free", due to "20 years of failed political administration", the "controversial Gasparri's Law of 2003" and the "possibility for prime minister to influence the RAI (Italian state-owned Radio-Television), a conflict of interests among the most blatant in the World".
Italy's status was upgraded to "free" in 2007 and 2008 under the Prodi II Cabinet, to come back as "partly free" since 2009 with the Berlusconi IV Cabinet. Freedom House noted that Italy constitutes "a regional outlier" and particularly quoted the "increased government attempts to interfere with editorial policy at state-run broadcast outlets, particularly regarding coverage of scandals surrounding prime minister Silvio Berlusconi." In their 2011 report, Freedom House continued to list Italy as "partly free" and ranked the country 24th out of 25 in the Western European region, ahead of Turkey.
Anti-defamation actions.
Defamation is a crime in Italy with the possibility of large fines and/or prison terms. Thus anti-defamation actions may intimidate reporters and encourage self-censorship.
In February 2004, the journalist Massimiliano Melilli was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a 100,000 euro fine for two articles, published on 9 and 16 November 1996, that reported rumors of "erotic parties" supposedly attended by members of Trieste high society.
In July, magistrates in Naples placed Lino Jannuzzi, a 76-year-old journalist and senator, under house arrest, although they allowed him the possibility of attending the work of the parliament during daytime. In 2002, he was arrested, found guilty of "defamation through the press" ("diffamazione a mezzo stampa"), and sentenced to 29 months’ imprisonment because of articles that appeared in a local paper for which he was editor-in-chief. The articles revealed irresponsible operation of the judiciary and highlighted what Jannuzzi called wrong and unjust sentences. Therefore, it was widely perceived that his sentence was given as revenge by the judiciary. Following heavy criticism from home and abroad, in February 2005, Italian President Ciampi pardoned Jannuzzi.
Mediaset and Berlusconi.
Berlusconi's extensive control over the media has been widely criticised by both analysts and press freedom organisations, who allege Italy's media has limited freedom of expression. The "Freedom of the Press 2004 Global Survey", an annual study issued by the American organization Freedom House, downgraded Italy's ranking from 'Free' to 'Partly Free' due to Berlusconi's influence over RAI, a ranking that, in "Western Europe" was shared only with Turkey (). Reporters Without Borders states that in 2004, "The conflict of interests involving prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his vast media empire was still not resolved and continued to threaten news diversity". In April 2004, the International Federation of Journalists joined the criticism, objecting to the passage of a law vetoed by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 2003, which critics believe is designed to protect Berlusconi's reported 90% control of the Italian television system.
"Editto Bulgaro".
Berlusconi's influence over RAI became evident when in Sofia, Bulgaria he expressed his views on journalists Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, and comedian Daniele Luttazzi. Berlusconi said that they "use television as a criminal mean of communication". They lost their jobs as a result. This statement was called by critics ""Editto Bulgaro"".
The TV broadcasting of a satirical programme called "RAIot" was censored in November 2003 after the comedienne Sabina Guzzanti (daughter of Paolo Guzzanti, former senator of Forza Italia) made outspoken criticism of the Berlusconi media empire.
"Par condicio".
Mediaset, Berlusconi's television group, has stated that it uses the same criteria as the public (state-owned) television RAI in assigning a proper visibility to all the most important political parties and movements (the so-called " 'Par Condicio' ", Latin for 'equal treatment' or 'Fairness Doctrine')—which has been since often disproved.
On June 24, 2009, during the Confindustria young members congress in Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy, Silvio Berlusconi invited advertisers to interrupt or boycott advertising contracts with the magazines and newspapers published by Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso, in particular the newspaper "la Repubblica" and the news-magazine "L'espresso", calling the publishing group "shameless" for fueling the economic crisis by bringing attention to it. He also accused them of making a "subversive attack" against him. The publishing group announced possible legal proceedings against Berlusconi to protect the image and the interests of the group.
In October 2009, Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Jean-François Julliard declared that Berlusconi "is on the verge of being added to our list of Predators of Press Freedom", which would be a first for a European leader. In the event, Berlusconi was not declared a Predator of Press Freedom, but RWB continued to warn of "the continuing concentration of media ownership, displays of contempt and impatience on the part of government officials towards journalists and their work" in Italy. Julliard added that Italy will probably be ranked last in the European Union in the upcoming edition of the RWB press freedom index. Italy was in fact ranked last in the EU in RWB's "Press Freedom Index 2010".
Internet censorship.
Italy is listed as engaged in selective Internet filtering in the social area and no evidence of filtering was found in the political, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas by the OpenNet Initiative in December 2010.
Currently, access to more than five thousand websites is filtered in the country.
Filtering in Italy is applied against child pornography, gambling, and some P2P web sites. Starting in February 2009, The Pirate Bay website and IP address are unreachable from Italy, blocked directly by Internet service providers. A controversial verdict issued by the Court of Bergamo, and later confirmed by the Supreme Court, allowed the blocking, stating that it was useful in order to prevent copyright infringement. Pervasive filtering is applied to gambling websites that do not have a local license to operate in Italy.
Several legal tools are in development to monitor and censor Internet access and content. Examples include the Romani law, a special law proposed by parliament after Facebook cases of a group against Prime Minister Berlusconi.
An anti-terrorism law, amended in 2005 by then-Minister of the Interior Giuseppe Pisanu after the terrorists attacks in Madrid and London, restricts the opening of new Wi-Fi hotspots. Interested entities must first apply for permission to open the hotspot at the local police headquarters. The law requires potential hotspot and Internet café users to present an identity document. This has inhibited the opening of hotspots across Italy, with the number of hotspots 5 times lower than France and led to an absence of municipal wireless networks. A proposed law should facilitate the opening of and access to Wi-Fi hotspots, although it is not clear how this would be accomplished. In 2009, only 32% of Italian Internet users have Wi-Fi access.
Censorship of Wikipedia.
On October 4, 2011, following a decision adopted by the community, the contents of the Italian version of Wikipedia were hidden and the website was blocked by its administrators, as a protest against paragraph 29 of the ""DDL intercettazioni"" (Wiretapping Bill). The proposed bill would empower anyone who believes themselves to have been offended by the content of a web site to enforce publication of a reply, uneditable and uncommented, on the same web site, within 48 hours and without any prior evaluation of the claim by a judge or to face a €12,000 fine. Some see it as an attempt by government to censor bloggers.
On October 4, 5, and 6, all pages on the Italian version of Wikipedia redirected to a statement opposing the proposed legislation. The statement is available in a number of languages, wiki-linked above "Cara lettrice, caro lettore". On October 7, the Italian Wikipedia pages were again available, but a notice about the proposed legislation was still displayed at the top of pages.

Royal Adelaide (1865)

The Royal Adelaide was an iron sailing ship of 1400 tons built by William Patterson at Bristol in 1865.
She was wrecked on Chesil Beach on 25 November 1872, while on a passage from London to Sydney with a crew of 32 and 35 passengers. In bad weather, the ship tried to reach the shelter of Portland Harbour, but was forced into Lyme Bay from which there was no exit in a storm. The anchors were lowered to try to prevent the ship being blown onto Chesil Beach. However, the anchors dragged and the ship began to break up on the beach. All but six on board were saved.
A large crowd gathered on the shore to help with the rescue and the salvage of the cargo, part of which was gin and brandy. By the end of the night four of the wreckers had died from exposure, having spent the night on the beach after becoming drunk on the cargo.
She now lies at OSGB36.

<doc id="19619375" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19619375" title="Sultanate of Darfur">
Sultanate of Darfur

The Sultanate of Darfur was a pre-colonial Nile Valley state in present-day Sudan. It functioned independently from 1603 to October 24, 1874.
Origins.
Darfur is composed mostly of semi-arid plains that cannot support a dense population. The one exception is the area in and around the Jebal Marra mountains. It was from bases in these mountains that a series of groups expanded to control the region. The Daju and the 14th century migrants the Tunjur were the earliest powers in Darfur according to written records. The transition of power from the Daju to the Tunjur was facilitated through marriage.
Eventually the Tunjur began marrying amongst the Fur people producing Sultan Dali, a celebrated figure in Darfur histories, who was on his mother's side a Fur, and thus brought the dynasty closer to the people it ruled. Dali divided the country into provinces, and established a penal code, which, under the title of Kitab Dali or Dali's Book, is still preserved, and differs in some respects from Quranic law. His grandson Suleiman (or "Sulayman", usually distinguished by the Fur epithet Solon, meaning "the Arab" or "the Red") reigned from 1603 to 1637, and was a great warrior and a devoted Muslim. Suleiman Solon is considered as the founder of the Keira dynasty and the sultanate of Darfur. During the 17th century, the Keira sultans introduced the feudal "hakura" system into Darfur.
Islam and Prosperity in Darfur.
The Tunjur introduced Islam to Darfur via their experience in the Muslim empires of Kanem and Ouaddai. Soleiman's grandson, Ahmed Bukr (c.1682-c.1722), made Islam the religion of the state, and increased the prosperity of the country by encouraging immigration from Bornu and Bagirmi. His rule extended east of the Nile as far as the banks of the Atbara.
Civil War (1722–1786).
The death of Bukr initiated a long-running conflict over the succession. On his deathbed, Bukr stated that each of his many sons should rule in turn. Once on the throne, each of his sons instead hoped to make their own son heir, leading to an intermittent civil war that lasted until 1785/6 (AH 1200) Due to these internal divisions, Darfur declined in importance and engaged in wars with Sennar and Wadai.
Mohammed II Tairab.
One of the most capable of the monarchs during this period was Sultan Mohammed Terab, one of Ahmad Bukr's sons. He led a number of successful campaigns. In 1785-1786 (AH 1200), he led an army against the Funj, but got no further than Omdurman. Here he was stopped by the Nile, and found no means of getting his army across the river. Unwilling to give up his project, Terab remained at Omdurman for months and the army began to grow disaffected. According to some stories Tayrab was poisoned by his wife at the instigation of disaffected chiefs, and the army returned to Darfur. While he tried to have his son succeed him, the throne instead went to his brother Abd al-Rahman.
Abd-er-Rahman the Just.
Abd-er-Rahman established a new capital at Al Fashir, meaning "the capital", in 1790. The capital had formerly been moved from place to place then at another location called Kobb. During his reign Abd-er-Rahman, surnamed el-Rashid or the Just, Napoleon Bonaparte was campaigning in Egypt. In 1799 Abd-er-Rahman wrote to congratulate the French general on his defeat of the Mamluks. Bonaparte replied by asking the sultan to send him by the next caravan 2000 black slaves upwards of sixteen years old, strong and vigorous.
Mohammed-el-Fadhl.
Mohammed-el-Fadhl, his son, was for some time under the control of an energetic eunuch, Mohammed Kurra, but he ultimately made himself independent, and his reign lasted till 1838, when he died of leprosy. He devoted himself largely to the subjection of the semi-independent Arab tribes who lived in the country, notably the Rizeigat, thousands of whom he slew. In 1821, he lost the province of Kordofan to the Egyptians under Mehemet Ali, who planned to conquer the Sudan. The Keira dispatched an army but it was routed by the Egyptians near Bara on 19 August 1821. The Egyptians had been intending to conquer the entirety Darfur, but their difficulties consolidating their hold on the Nile region forced them to abandon these plans. Al-Fadl died in 1838 and of his forty sons, the third, Mohammed Hassan, was appointed his successor. Hassan is described as a religious but avaricious man. In 1856 he went blind and for the rest of his reign his sister Zamzam, the iiry bassi, was the de facto ruler of the sultanate.
The "Turkiyya" (Ottoman rule).
In 1856, a Khartoum businessman, al-Zubayr Rahma, began operations in the land south of Darfur. He set up a network of trading posts defended by well-armed forces and soon had a sprawling state under his rule. This area known as the Bahr el Ghazal had long been the source of the goods that Darfur would trade to Egypt and North Africa, especially slaves and ivory. The natives of Bahr el Ghazal paid tribute to Darfur, and these were the chief articles of merchandise sold by the Darfurians to the Egyptian traders along the road to Asyut. Al-Zubayr redirected this flow of goods to Khartoum and the Nile.
Sultan Hassan died in 1873 and the succession passed to his youngest son Ibrahim, who soon found himself engaged in a conflict with al-Zubayr. After earlier conflicts with the Egyptians, Al-Zubayr had become their ally and in cooperation with them agreed to conquer Darfur. The war resulted in the destruction of the kingdom. Ibrahim was slain in battle in the autumn of 1874, and his uncle Hassab Alla, who sought to maintain the independence of his country, was captured in 1875 by the troops of the khedive, and removed to Cairo with his family.
Conquest.
Darfur was conquered and its last sultan, Ali Dinar, killed by the British in 1916, when Ali Dinar gave his support to the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. The sultanate then passed to the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium.

Konstantin Fotinov

Konstantin Georgiev Fotinov () (c. 1790 – 29 November 1858) was a Bulgarian writer, translator and enlightener of the Bulgarian National Revival period. The publisher of the first Bulgarian-language magazine, he is regarded as the founder of the Bulgarian press.
Fotinov was born in the town of Samokov around 1790 to the family of a small-time merchant from Plovdiv. He studied at a local monastical school before continuing his education in Plovdiv in Thrace and in Kydonies in Anatolia; he was tutored by the Greek humanist Theophilos Kairis. He worked on a translation of the Bible into Bulgarian for the BFBS, but they did not approve it. From 1828 on, Fotinov worked as a teacher and man of letters. He founded a private mixed Hellenic-Bulgarian school in İzmir (Smyrna) and employed the Bell-Lancaster method. The school's programme included Bulgarian, Greek and French classes. It had around 200 pupils from all around the Bulgarian lands.
Fotinov was the editor and publisher of the first Bulgarian magazine, "Lyuboslovie" ("philology", "love of words"), which he issued in Smyrna from 1844 to 1846. The magazine was richly illustrated and included articles on history, geography, religion, morale, enlightenment, medicine, hygiene, language, etc. Fotinov also published a Greek grammar book (1838) and a Bulgarian phrasebook (1845) and translated a geographic book from Greek to Bulgarian (1843). It was Fotinov that first addressed the issue of female education in the Bulgarian press.
From 1852 on, Fotinov worked on a Bulgarian translation of the Bible. He managed to translate the Old Testament: the Book of Psalms was published in Smyrna in 1855 and the Book of Genesis was issued in Istanbul (Tsarigrad) in 1857.

Mark Ptashne (born June 5, 1940 in Chicago) is a molecular biologist and violinist. He currently holds the Ludwig Chair of Molecular Biology at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was the first scientist to demonstrate specific binding between protein and DNA, and his lifelong work has been the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of switch between lytic and lysogenic lifecyle of bacteriophage lambda, as well as how the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4 works. He was the originator of the "ball and stick" model of transcription factor function, demonstrating in bacteria and in yeast that they typically consist of separable regions that mediate DNA binding and interaction with transcriptional activators or repressors. In 1980 he cofounded Genetics Institute, Inc. with Thomas Maniatis, which was acquired by Wyeth 1996. In 1985, he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. He won the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1997, and the Massry Prize from the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California in 1998.

The feature was known to American and British sealers as Blythe Bay as early as 1821. In the 1930s, however, the name was applied to a large bay between Williams Point and Cape Shirreff (now Hero Bay). This error has now been rectified and the name Blythe Bay is approved as originally used. The name is probably after Blythe (now Blyth), England, home of William Smith who reported the discovery of the South Shetland Islands in 1819.

Aruna Ratanagiri

Aruna Ratanagiri Buddhist Monastery (Harnham Buddhist Monastery) is a Theravada Buddhist monastery of the Thai Forest Tradition in Northumberland, England. The community consists of monks, novices and postulants from a wide range of nationalities, usually numbering around eight Sangha members. The monastery includes an adjacent lay retreat facility known as "Kusala House".
History.
The monastery was founded in response to increasing interest, particularly in northeast England, in the Thai Forest Tradition, as it was being established by Ajahn Sumedho and disciples of Ajahn Chah in England in the late 1970s. When, in 1980, a group of local yoga students tried to find a suitable cottage which they could offer as a retreat facility to the Sangha, farmer John Wake of Harnham Hall, Harnham, near Belsay responded, and they agreed to rent one of his farm cottages. In 1981 Ajahn Sucitto (now the abbot of Cittaviveka/Chithurst Buddhist Monastery) became the first bhikkhu to take up residence, and began initial renovations; on June 21, 1981 the monastery was officially opened by Ajahn Sumedho and in that same year the "Magga Bhavaka Trust" was established as a charitable trust in order to steward financial support for the new monastery (the monastery now has a new trust: "Harnham Buddhist Monastery Trust"). 
Vision.
The primary focus for Aruna Ratanagiri monastery is to provide and maintain a sanctuary suitable for the training and ongoing practice of Theravada bhikkhus, in keeping with the Pali vinaya and forest tradition of Northeast Thailand.
Today, through freely distributed books and Dhamma talks, regular discussion groups and Sunday evening talks, and also in the context of more than five times yearly meditation retreats, Harnham offers spiritual support for practitioners far and wide. Monks from Harnham regularly visit affiliated Buddhist meditation groups in the north east of England and Scotland. In addition, a lot of non-Buddhist groups and individual visitors, including school and university groups, come to the monastery to learn about Buddhism.
Abbots.
• Ajahn Sucitto (1981–1981)
• Ajahn Viradhammo (1981–1983)
• Ajahn Anando (1983–1984)

Sabinus of Heraclea

Sabinus of Heraclea was bishop of Heraclea in Thrace, and a leader of the party and sect of Macedonius. He was the author of a collection of the Acts of the councils of the Catholic Church, from the council of Nicaea to his own time. William Cave fixes the date at which Sabinus flourished as c. 425.
The church history of Sabinus was much used by Socrates of Constantinople in his "Ecclesiastical History", who speaks of it as untrustworthy, because Sabinus was partisan, and omitted, and even wilfully altered, facts and statements adverse to his views and interests. Socrates shews how Sabinus tries to disparage the fathers of Nicaea in the face of the contrary evidence of Eusebius, and makes no mention whatever of Macedonius, lest he should have to describe his deeds.
Baronius speaks strongly of Sabinus's unscrupulous handling of history, calls him "homo mendacissimus," and suggests that Sozomen gives a garbled account of the election of Athanasius, "ex officina Sabini."

Benjamin Green (July 1, 1713 – October 14, 1772) was a merchant, judge and political figure in Nova Scotia. He served as administrator for Nova Scotia in 1766 and from 1771 to 1772. He was born in Salem Village (later Danvers, Massachusetts), the son of the Reverend Joseph Green and Elizabeth Gerrish, and entered business with his brothers in Boston. In 1737, he married Margaret Pierce. He was secretary to William Pepperrell, who led the attack against Louisbourg in 1745, and served as treasurer for the forces from New England and secretary for the council that administered Louisbourg after its capture. In 1749, he went to Halifax, where he was named to Edward Cornwallis's Nova Scotia Council and also served as naval officer. Green was also judge in the vice admiralty court; he resigned in 1753. In 1750, he became secretary to the Council and provincial treasurer. Green was named a justice of the peace in 1760. While in England to assist in auditing the accounts of Peregrine Thomas Hopson, he had to defend himself against charges of assigning contracts to Malachy Salter in exchange for a share in the profits. He was reprimanded but allowed to retain his posts. During his term as administrator in 1766, he was criticized by the provincial assembly for not following the correct procedures for dealing with the provincial finances. Green resigned his post as provincial treasurer in 1768, citing poor health. He died at Halifax at the age of 59. An audit of the provincial accounts following his death found them deficient.

Tsegaye Kebede

Tsegaye Kebede Wordofa (Amharic: ፀጋየ ከበደ ዎርዶፋ; born 15 January 1987) is an Ethiopian long-distance runner who competes in road running events, including marathons. He quickly rose to become a prominent distance runner after his international debut at the Amsterdam Marathon in 2007. In his second year of professional running, he won the Paris Marathon, the Fukuoka Marathon and won the marathon bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
In the 2009 season he established himself as one of Ethiopia's top athletes: he came second in the London Marathon and at his first World Championships in Athletics he took the bronze medal in the marathon. He retained his Fukuoka Marathon title at the end of 2009, running the fastest ever marathon race in Japan. He won the 2010 London Marathon – his first World Marathon Major – and the 2013 London Marathon.
Early years.
Tsegaye Kebede was brought up as part of a large family, the fifth child of thirteen, and his early years were marked by poverty. Living in Gerar Ber, a town some 40 km north of Addis Ababa, he collected firewood to sell and herded livestock to supplement his father's earnings, paying for his own education and the rest of his family. He ate one meal a day and had to work every day to earn around 2.50 Ethiopian birr (US$0.30).
He began running for pleasure as an 8-year old and, after competing at a half marathon in Addis Ababa in 2006, an athletics coach (Getaneh Tessema) offered him the chance to train with his group. He attended a 10 km time trial session with the group in the following days, and he beat all runners with the exception of Deriba Merga, who went on to win the Great Ethiopian Run that year. He won the Abebe Bikila International Marathon a few months later, effectively resolving the visa problems he had encountered while trying to race overseas. His first marathon race abroad was the 2007 Amsterdam Marathon and he finished eighth with a new personal best of 2:08:16. This time and finish established him among Ethiopia's top marathon runners—Haile Gebrselassie and Deriba Merga were the only Ethiopians to run faster times that year.
Olympic and World Championship competition.
Keen to establish himself, he looked towards obtaining a spot on the Ethiopian 2008 Olympic team for the marathon race. He took second place behind Patrick Makau Musyoki at the Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon with a time of 59:35, a personal best. A win at the Paris Marathon in April improved his chances of selection, as his sprint finish earned him another personal best with 2:06:40. He finished third in the World 10K Bangalore race the following month, setting a best of 28:10 over the distance. Haile Gebrselassie stated that he did not intend to compete in the Beijing Olympics, meaning that Kebede and Merga would carry the medal hopes for Ethiopia.
With only two years of competitive running and one year of international competition to his credit, the 21-year-old Kebede won the bronze medal in men's marathon at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, passing teammate Deriba Merga in the last 400 metres of the race. He won the Great North Run in October, and finished the year with a win at the Fukuoka International Marathon; his time of 2:06:10 broke Samuel Wanjiru's course record and was the fastest marathon on Japanese soil. This raised him in the rankings to the twelfth fastest ever marathon runner at the time.
He remained in strong form the following year: he set a new personal best of 2:05:20 at the 2009 London Marathon, taking second place behind Wanjiru. This elevated him into the top ten in the all-time marathon lists and made him the second fastest Ethiopian after world record holder Haile Gebrselassie. Representing Ethiopia at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, Kebede repeated the feat he had achieved a year earlier at the Olympics, overtaking Deriba Merga and taking the bronze medal as the fastest Ethiopian finisher in the World Championship marathon. He improved his best further at the end of that year, winning the Fukuoka International Marathon for a second time. He finished the race in 2:05:18, a new course record and again setting the fastest time ever recorded for the marathon in Japan.
At the 2010 London Marathon, he set his sights on beating the defending champion Samuel Wanjiru. Wanjiru dropped out at 20 km, however, and Kebede saw off a challenge from Abel Kirui at the 30 km mark. The pacemakers were not quick through the early stages and Kebede had enough energy to sprint for the line, but his time of 2:05:19 was nine seconds short of the record and a second away from Kebede's best. The 2010 Chicago Marathon in October provided a much closer battle with Wanjiru. Kebede closely followed the pacemakers and repeatedly surged ahead of the field. Wanjiru managed to make up ground each time and, running in increasingly high temperatures, Kebede was overtaken by him in the last 400 m and he finished in second place with a time of 2:06:43. This result also left him behind Wanjiru in the race for the World Marathon Majors jackpot, but he was generally positive about the defeat: "I am happy. This is not the end. I will run again".
He attempted to defend his title in the 2011 London Marathon, but could not keep up with the leaders' pace at the 30 km mark, and had to settle for fifth place with a time of 2:07:47. He was not chosen for the Ethiopian 2012 London Olympics marathon team despite the pleas of Haile Gebrselassie to their country's selection committee. At the Great Manchester Run in May he came runner-up to Gebrselassie but ran a personal best of 27:56 minutes. He entered the 2012 Chicago Marathon and went one better than his 2010 performance to win the race. He gradually pulled ahead of the pack in the second half of the race and managed a course record time of 2:04:38, also a personal best.
In April 2013, Kebede beat "the world's best marathon field" by 29 seconds to win the London Marathon in 2:06:04. At 21.7 miles (35km), he trailed the race's eventual second-place finisher and course record holder Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya by 43 seconds, slowed by a pain in his side. "The Independent" described Kebede as a "pocket-battleship clad in a blue vest – a runner with a boxer's stance" and called his race finish "devastating".

Pandy, Wrexham

The Pandy (Welsh Y Pandy, meaning the fulling mill) is a village near Gwersyllt and Rhosrobin in the borough of Wrexham, the main entrance to Gresford Colliery stood in the village. Gresford Colliery Social Club is in the village and alongside it a memorial to the Gresford Disaster which killed 266 men on September 22, 1934.
Plas Acton Road originally linked the village to the main Chester Road, but was severed by the A483 by-pass, a large footbridge crosses the new road maintaining the link for pedestrians only. There are the remains of a mill on the River Alyn just below the village at the rear of the Pandy Business Park, in an area known as "The Wilderness".
The Gresford Heath estate, built around the year 2000 on the site of the coalsheds for the former Colliery, doubled the population of the village. The naming reflects an attempt to raise house values in a former industrial village and to deWelshify the village name. A new development of 9 luxury houses has been built on the site of the former Goodwins Milk/Express Dairy depot. There have been further plans for housing to go on the nearby fields to Pandy but local people have objected to more houses. 
The coal tip on the edge of the village is the proposed site of a development of a dry ski slope, conveniently located on the main Wrexham - Chester road. There are two small industrial estates in the village again on the old Colliery site.

Erich Itor Kahn

Erich Itor Kahn (23 July 1905 - 5 March 1956) was a German composer of Jewish descent, who emigrated to the United States during the years of National Socialism. 
Biography.
He was born in Rimbach in the Odenwald, the son of Leopold Kahn, a mathematician and synagogue cantor. He studied piano and composition at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, where his teachers included Paul Franzen and Bernhard Sekles; he concluded his studies in 1928, although he had been giving public recitals of classical and contemporary repertoire since 1919. He then worked for Radio Frankfurt as a pianist, harpsichordist, composer and arranger, reporting to Hans Rosbaud, director of the Radio's music department. In this capacity he met many leading contemporary composers, and on 29 January 1930 gave the world premiere of the Piano Piece op. 33a by Arnold Schoenberg. 
In April 1933 he was dismissed from his post by the Nazis and emigrated to Paris with his wife Frida (née Rabinowitch). There he became friendly with René Leibowitz, to whom he introduced Schoenberg's Twelve-note technique. At the beginning of World War II he was interned as an enemy alien at the Camp des Milles in the southeastern France; Kahn wrote several distinctive keyboard works including the "Ciaconna dei tempi di guerra" (1943) composed for Ralph Kirkpatrick to play on the harpsichord, though it is also performable on piano.

Milwaukee Road class L2

The Milwaukee Road class L2 were 2-8-2 or "Mikado"-type steam locomotives built by or for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (“The Milwaukee Road”) in the period 1912–1923.
Construction history.
There were three sub-classes of the class L2: the L2 proper comprised 40 locomotives, built by Milwaukee Road’s Milwaukee Shops in 1912–13, 115 by Alco’s Brooks Works in 1912, and 25 by Alco’s Schenectady Works in 1914. They were followed by 100 class L2-a built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1920, and 100 class L2-b in 1922, also built by Baldwin.
Numbering.
L2.
When originally built, the Milwaukee Shops locomotives had been allocated 1800–1839, however only the first seven carried these numbered before the allocation became 8000–8039. Similarly, the only the first 50 Brooks locomotives received their 1840–1889 numbers, before their allocation was changed to 8040–8154. The Schenectady engines were numbered 8155–8179.
Sixty-nine L2 locomotives received mechanical stokers and were reclassified as class L2-r. At the Milwaukee Road’s 1938 renumbering, the remaining 62 L2-r locomotives were renumbered 600–661, with the remaining 77 non-stoker fitted L2 locomotives receiving numbers 662–738.
L2-a.
The 100 L2-a locomotives were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works as 8200–8299, and became 500–599 in 1938.
L2-b.
The 100 L2-b locomotives were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works as 8300–8399, and became 400–499 in 1938.

Uzundzhovo

Uzundzhovo () is a village in southeastern Bulgaria, part of Haskovo municipality, Haskovo Province. As of 2008, it has a population of 1,727 and the mayor is Vancho Vanchev. The village lies in the agricultural Upper Thracian Plain (Northern Thrace), east of Haskovo, south of Dimitrovgrad and west of Simeonovgrad and Harmanli. During Ottoman rule, the village was known as "Uzunca ova" ("long meadow"), a direct translation of the area's former Byzantine Greek appellation, "Makri livada". The village's current name is derived from the Ottoman Turkish name and modified with the Slavic placename suffix "-ovo". An architectural reminder of the village's Ottoman history can also be seen, as the local Church of the Assumption was built originally as a mosque. Uzundzhovo hosts the Bulgarian Air Force's 21st Fighter and Bomber Airbase, shut down in 1998.
Trade fair.
In Ottoman times, Uzundzhovo was famous as the site of the international Uzundzhovo Fair (Узунджовски панаир, "Uzundzhovski panair"). According to the German historian Hammer, the fair was established by Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha in 1593. It was organized regularly from the early 18th century to 1876 and gathered up to 50,000 people for around 40 days. The site was chosen because of Uzundzhovo's location on the trade route from Plovdiv to Edirne, between the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Danube. The 69th issue of the Istanbul-based Bulgarian newspaper "Tsarigradski vestnik" of 15 October 1849 describes the fair as follows:
A newspaper report in "Vek" of 7 September 1874 underlines the importance of the fair:
The Uzundzhovo Fair was one of the most famous fairs in the Ottoman Empire and the most important one in Rumelia; as such, the authorities took great care to keep the roads in good condition and protect the merchants from the robbers hiding in the nearby forests. However, this was not always possible and robber assaults were always a major issue. Some of the more well-known goods that were sold at the fair were velvet and silk clothes, gems, coffee, sugar, Persian carpets, English tin and paints, Italian cloth and glass, Russia leathers. The fair was visited by famous 19th-century Bulgarians such as Georgi Rakovski, Nayden Gerov, Petko Slaveykov, Dobri Chintulov, Hadzhi Dimitar and Vasil Levski. Gradually, the Uzundzhovo Fair lost its international importance. The Plovdiv Fair, organized since 1892, assumed its role of the region's leading trade show.

Krestovsky Island

Krestovsky Island () is a 3.4 km² island in Saint Petersburg, Russia, situated between several tributaries of the Neva: the Srednyaya Nevka, the Malaya Nevka and the Krestovka. The island is served by the Krestovsky Ostrov "Крестовский остров" station of Saint Petersburg Metro. Until recently, the western part of the island was occupied by the Maritime Victory Park, where the international Goodwill Games of sports and athletics competition took place in 1994, which was the first large scale post-Soviet Union international event in Russia. A new stadium Zenit Stadium is currently under construction, where Kirov Stadium was previously located. The Zenit stadium will serve the same name club, which is the leading St Petersburg football club. FC Zenit Saint Petersburg has frequently led the Russian football top league and recently has had good international success, in the Champions/UEFA leagues. 
Meanwhile, the eastern part of this beautiful St Petersburg island, has seen slow but steady urbanization since the early 1900s, which has slowly changed its parkland nature. Recently there has been even more pressure from today's "nomenclature" to locate top-end housing projects and high-prestige homes here - a long-time tendency that also continues today, since historically the island was always owned by families who were close to and favourites of the Tzars/"powers-to-be" and who served them well.
History.
The history of Krestovsky island and its near past up to early 1900s is closely tied with the owners of the island, the Belosselsky-Belozersky family, and the way they developed and used the island. In the 19th through early 20th centuries the island belonged to the Belosselsky-Belozersky family. Aided by the infusion of wealth from the fortune of his second wife Anna Grigorievna (ne'e Kozitskaya and the wealth through her mother's Myasnikov family from Siberian mining and metals fortunes) Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Belosselsky-Belozersky acquired the island in 1803. Previously it had belonged to the courtier Count Cyril Razumovsky and his family. During the mid-1800s the Belosselskys reconstructed the original Razumovsky stone manor house, which was located at the southern shore of the island using the well-known architect A.I. Stackenschneider for the works. This house served the family as their summer retreat for years to come.
In the 1880s after having sold their famous Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace (the pink palace at No. 41 Nevsky Prospect at the Anichkov Bridge) to Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich Romanov (Tzar Nikolai the IInd's uncle) the Belosselsky-Belozersky family moved to live on their Krestovsky island and the estate at the southern side of the island, now year-round. They reconstructed the original Stackenschneider designed manorial building into a small palace (using the contemporary court architect Rastrelli for its design). Popularly, this building was known as the "Datcha of the Belosselskys".
Many street names on Krestovsky island today still remind of and reflect the Belosselsky-Belozersky family having owned and occupied the Krestovsky island: e.g. "Olgina", "Eleninskaya", "Esperova", "Konstantinova" streets have survived the change of times and herald the names of some of the Belosselsky-Belozersky immediate family members who lived on the island at the end of the Tzarist period until the 1917 Russian Revolution (Olga's street, Elena's street, Esper's street, Constantin's street, respectively). Prior to the Revolution the main north to south street leading to the Belosselsky-Belozersky manor house was named "Belosselsky Prospect" (the Belosselsky avenue/view). After the Revolution of 1917, the street name was changed to "Riukhina" street (which runs South towards the edge of Malaya Nevka from the new Metro station on the island). The St Petersburg citycouncil has approved and implemented, at the end of June 2011, the renaming of this part of the street to "Belosselsky Pereulok" (the Belosselsky Lane), bringing back a relevant piece of the Krestovsky history and improving the awareness of this important period of the islands history. 
However, the "Alexandrovskii" avenue (avenue named for the first Belosselsky owner of the island, Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Belosselsky-Belozersky), "Nadezhdinskaya" (wife of Constantin Esperovich), "Sergeievskaya", "Andreievskaya" (sons of Sergei Constantinovich), "Mariinskaya" streets (daughter of Constantin Esperovich) as well as the "Nikolaievsky" and "Vladimirsky" streets (named for the Tzar and the Romanov Grand Duke for whom Belosselskys served as aide de camp during the last years of the Tzarist era), these all have been victims of urbanization and disappeared under apartment blocks and Dynamo sports facilities built in the 1950s and since. 
Two interesting streets and their names "Yuriyuzanskaya" and "Vyazovaya" still remain, reflecting two of the three main areas of metals and mining and the ironworks in the Urals, which were properties in Bashkiria/Bashkortostan (between Ufa and Cheliabinsk) owned by the Belosselsky family, (these also as a legacy of the marriage of Alexander Mikhailovich Belosselsky-Belozersky to Anna Grigorievna Kozitskaya and her inheritance from Myasnikovs) and from where they drew some of their enormous wealth still during the end of 19th century. The third such street, "Katavskaya" street, does not exist any longer. "Katavskaya" street was named for the ironworks of Ust-Katav and Katav-Ivanovsk, which were major producers of metals and metalproducts for the Belosselskys' enterprises. This street used to run parallel to the Belosselsky Prospect, immediately east of it and on the southern side of "Morskoy" prospect and has since the 1950s building of apartment "massifs" (blocks) been overtaken by these and "Dinamo" club's sporting venues and fields. The current "Dinamo Prospect" has replaced the former "Alexandrovskii Prospect" as the avenue leading from the "Krestovsky Most" (Bridge) in the eastern bridge-led entry to the island toward the Belosselsky-Belozersky summer palace/manor house, formerly the main conduit to the manor house but now blocked by the Dinamo sports fields and other adjacent constructed buildings.
Finally, the "Novorossiskaya" street, which also was overtaken by these same buildings and sportfields, ran parallel to the "Katavskaya" street to its east. This street was named in honor of Sergei Constantinovich being the commander of His Majesty's Third Dragoons of Novorossiisk Dragoons' Regiment. The same fate has fallen to the southwestern embankment of the island, which was named "Amerikanskaya ulitsa" (American street) in honor of the nationality of Sergei Constantinovich' wife Suzy Belosselsky-Belozersky ne'e Susan Tucker-Whittier (daughter of General, US Army, Charles Whittier).
Early sports venue for tennis, polo, sailing, rowing.
On Krestovsky island, many "first" Russian sports venues and activities were launched with Belosselsky-Belozersky active support. The Krestovsky tennis club "Lawn Tennis Club", (with the main efforts undertaken by the resident Scotsman Arthur MacPherson, whose sons were some of the first Russian tennis champions with George Vassilievich Bray, who is considered to have been the first Russian Champion. George was also the Treasurer of the Krestovsky Lawn Tennis Club; See the note at the bottom of this paragraph for more information) Belosselsky horse polo grounds, as well as a yacht club and a rowing club were launched here in late 19th century along with a clay pigeon shooting range; all prior to the 1917 Revolution. 
The island was always a center for sports and recreation for the St. Petersburg residents. Prior to the revolution, it was also a unique gathering place and venue for the "high-society" active in sports, the military officers and foreign diplomats, who participated in the horse polo events organized by the Belosselsky-Belozerskys. As this sport was known to be a preferred sport of Englishmen at the time, the elder prince Belosselsky-Belozersky, Constantin Esperovich, became known as the "Angloman" for his keen interest in promoting this sport. His elder son, prince Sergei Constantinovich was one of the first Russian international players of polo and took part regularly in the annual events in England and France at Rugby, Paris Bagatelle, Deauville, Biarritz, Pau, etc. He organized many horse polo competitions on their Krestovsky island estate polo grounds, including international team events. Well known visiting and resident international players of the time included British Ambassador Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst (later Viceroy of India), British embassy secretaries Beaumont, Sperling, American Ambassador George von L. Meyer and Chargé d'Affaires Spencer Eddy were among the company of the first local Russian players, who in addition to the Belosselskys, were Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Prince Michael [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prince_Mikhail_Mikhailovich_Cantacuz%C3%A8ne&redirect=no] Cantacuzène-Speranski, Count Kinsky, Messrs. Mouravyi and Grabovski. A special frequent player was Sergei Constantinovich's fellow general, later a Finnish Marshal, Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, who also was part of the inauguration competition of the Krestovsky polo field, in the summer of 1897! Sergei Constantinovich was also a founder and sponsor of an early St. Petersburg athletics club named "Sport", which was located on Krestovsky island. His activities led to him being invited to become a Russian representative to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This made him the second all-time Russian and 28th overall representative to this venerable and still very active key international sports body. Prince Sergei acceded the IOC together with count Ribopierre, after Major-General A.D. Butovsky and before prince Troubetskoy. In capacity of the IOC member, prince Sergei participated in the organizational committee of the 1900 Paris Olympic games and took part in equestrian events. 
During the Soviet times, as well, the Krestovsky island was the base of many of the most successful sport and rowing clubs; among other, Energia and Krasnoe Znamia (Красное Знамя). Some fourteen Olympic champions came from this tradition. Founded in 1889 and active still on Krestovsky Island during the early 1990s as Znamia, the club produced Olympic rowing champions Y. Tiykalov, V. Boreiko, O.Golovanov, and A. Klepikov, as well as three-time Olympic kayaking/canoeing champion L. Pinaeva. In addition the club produced several World and European champions. A tradition started after WW II by the Krestovsky rowers is still alive today. The autumn meet in rowing they started became an international competition and continues as such today-every first Sunday of October.
The island was also home to the Leningrad division of the "peoples' committee on internal affairs (NKVD)" sports and football club "Dinamo". Dinamo's athletic fields and grounds as well as clubhouse in the "functional" architectural style of the 1930s is the area due east of the Belosselsky-Belozelsky rebuilt manor-house. These cover still a large area despite recent encroaching business and apartment/housing projects.
Today, Krestovsky island continues its tradition as a base for sports and recreation and is still the home to half a dozen tennis clubs, several boating and rowing clubs as well as the site of the new "Zenith" football club stadium, replacing the Kirov stadium at the western spit of the island. Svetlana Kuznetsova, is the best-known contemporary Russian tennis player coming from the Krestovsky island tennis tradition of Russian champions, started by the Scot MacPherson, his sons as well as Mikhail Sumarakoff-Elston and George Bray in the late 19th century. She is regularly ranked among the top ten professionals in the ladies' world rankings.
Although the island has changed significantly since the Russian Revolution in terms of its land use, even more so during the past decade, there is still the dominant presence of sports on Krestovsky.
Belosselsky-Belozersky residence.
Today, the Belosselsky-Belozersky residence on Krestovsky island has been reconstructed at the same location where it stood until the late 1950s (the original structure was badly damaged during the near 900 day siege of Leningrad, from shelling during World War II; it was repaired and used for various purposes, but was demolished finally around 1956). The rebuilt "Datcha" is true to the original architectural drawings but boasts all modern conveniences indoors, such as elevators, etc. It has been put on the market for sale recently. 
Meanwhile, the only original structures which remain of the Belosselsky-Belozersky era to these days are some horse stables on the now former Riukhina street, present Belosselsky Pereulok/Lane and the still beautiful landscaped park with a small pond and walkways around it adjacent on the north-western and western side of the area where the Belosselsky-Belozersky house stood and now stands again. 
There is also the unique "accent" piece of the estate remaining by the edge of the water, of the Malaya Nevka, due south of the property (and the rebuilt house). This is a beautiful dark rose colored granite stone structure, holding a bench circular steps enveloping the structure and leading to the water's edge, forming a landing for boats and offering a calm venue to view the Southern exposure from the estate. The structure, sitting under the shade of oak and linden trees, was draped with a beautiful wrought iron and bronze balustrade (original design of this beautiful structure was by a Swiss architect).
Duel on Krestovsky Island.
Duel between Prince Nicholas Yusupov, Count Sumarakoff-Elston, and Count Arvid Manteuffel, over Marina von Hayden, the latter's wife. Nicholas Yusupov had caused a great open scandal by having an affair with the wife of the Imperial Horse Guards' officer. It seems Felix Yusupov his younger brother had organized their first meeting. 
The deadly encounter took place at dawn on July 5, 1908, when Count Manteuffel and Prince Yusupov met in a duel on the park land grounds of an estate owned by Belosselsky-Belozersky family, probably Sergei Belosselsky-Belozersky.
The parties and their seconds met as agreed at dawn on the 5th of July 1908. Nicholas Yusupov was mortally wounded by the second round of shots and died. 
Rasputin.
On 1 January 1917 (Old Style) the corpse of Grigory Rasputin was found close Bolshoj Petrovsky Most (bridge), off Krestovsky Island. From Maurice Paleologue's diary who was the last French Ambassador to Imperial Russia we know most of the gossip.

Jar (unit)

A jar was an early unit of capacitance once used by the Royal Navy. The term relates to the capacitance of a Leyden jar.
Its value is such that one Farad is approximately 900 million jars and one jar is 1.111 nanoFarads.
History.
With early spark-gap transmitters, changing the transmission frequency was most easily accomplished by changing the number of Leyden jars connected to the tank circuit. While it was possible to calculate the required capacitance directly, it was more usual to simply have a book of lookup tables which gave the number of jars needed for any likely wavelength.

Naltriben

Naltriben is a potent and selective antagonist for the delta opioid receptor, which is used in scientific research. It has similar effects to the more widely used δ antagonist naltrindole, but with different binding affinity for the δ1 and δ2 subtypes, which makes it useful for distinguishing the subtype selectivity of drugs acting at the δ receptors. It also acts as a κ-opioid agonist at high doses.

He won the first WPA World Ten-ball Championship in 2008 against Wu Chia-ching, the former world champion in both nine-ball and eight-ball from Taiwan. With the victory, he became the second male player from Britain to win a world championship after Daryl Peach who won the world nine-ball title a year earlier.
Appleton, who started playing pool at age 12, was formerly the world ranked no. 1 player in British-style eight-ball pool. He was twice runner-up in the WEPF Eight-ball Pool World Championship. In 2006, he joined the International Pool Tour's standardised eight-ball competition. That year, he also won the Straight Pool Challenge at the Derby City Classic.
On 5 October 2008, Appleton claimed an upset victory in the inaugural WPA World Ten-ball Championship over Wu Chia-ching, 13–11, winning the US$100,000 top prize: "I've waited 16 years for this and have to enjoy the moment. I had mixed feelings and I was looking back at my disappointments in the past. I was ranked first (earlier in the decade) in the world but I have never won a world championship... It was a dream come true for me and I'm happy to win the title here in the Philippines."
In May 2009, Appleton challenged Dennis Hatch of the United States in a three-day race-to-100 challenge match of ten-ball. Hatch, however, came out the victor with a score of 100-83. In the same year, he won the World Pool Masters tournament by defeating Nick van den Berg.
Darren Appleton also won the 2010 U.S. Open 9-ball Championship against Corey Deuel of the United States in a match that went into extra racks.

Lawren Pope

Lawren Michele Pope in an American fashion designer. She is best known for the clothing line, Fuchsia, she began with Veronica Scott at age 14.
Career.
Most notably, Pope is recognized for the design house Fuchsia that she and business partner Veronica Scott began in 2001. Veronica and Lawren have mentioned in several interviews that they were polar opposites when they met the first day of freshman year at Westside High School. Scott describes her style as "Abercrombie & Fitch", while her counterpart was more "Hot Topic." Still, Lawren says that she is messy, while Veronica is highly organized, however their friendship was cemented by their mutual love of design. The Houston Chronicle has quoted Pope as saying, "Now we are inseparable; Over the years we've meshed into something."
Lawren and Veronica have since gained more notoriety since moving to California, and frequently attend events in both San Diego and Los Angeles. Neither girls have attended fashion school or have any formal training; and credited their grandmothers for having taught them how to sew.
Shortly after leaving Houston, Scott and Pope began Save the Girls; an organization dedicated to providing scholarships for girls interested in pursuing a degree in business. Save the Girls is funded through the collection of California Redemption Valued (CRV) recyclable items. The not-for-profit also has a curbside recycling service, offers free vocational training, and is an active participant in the conservation movement.
Lawren was also signed to modeling agency, Page 713 (Page Parkes Modeling Agency), and appeared in print ads for companies such as Cingular and Hewlett Packard. Past talent also represented by Page Parkes include Alexis Bledel, Channing Tatum, and Angelina Jolie.
Pope has since left the agency to focus on her professional career. When speaking about Fuchsia, Lawren has said, "This is not just a tuba sitting in the back of my closet. I want to do this for a while."
In September 2008, Lawren announced that she and Veronica were in pre-production for their reality series "The Fuchsia Girls" set to air in the Spring of 2009. The show will follow Pope and Scott as they create a new collection, promote Save the Girls, and attend separate universities for the first time.
Personal life.
The eldest of three, and the daughter of Lynn Michele Harris and Lawrence Lowell Pope Jr. Pope was born and raised in Houston, Texas, where she attended both Westside and Lee High School. 
Following graduation in 2005, Lawren completed her freshman year of college at Houston Baptist University before relocating with Fuchsia's company headquarters to San Diego, California. There, Pope continues to expand the company and pursue an International Business degree.

Henry Herbert Collier

Henry Herbert Collier was one of the first British motorcycle designers, inventor and founder of the Matchless Motorcycle Company.
Early life.
Collier was born in Plumstead, London. 
Business.
Henry Collier founded a company to make bicycles under the Matchless name in Herbert Road, Plumstead in 1878. When his two eldest sons Henry (known as Harry) and Charlie joined him in the business it became 'H Collier & Sons'. Their competitors were experimenting with adding engines to their bicycles, so the Colliers tried a small motor over the front wheel, then moved it to under the front down tube, then finally into the traditional diamond-shaped frame. Using De Dion and Puteaux engines, the Colliers added one of the first pillion seats in 1903 and chain drive in 1905. 
The Colliers also decided to enter their machines in the new Isle of Man TT and the first TT race in 1907 was won by Collier's son Charles on a 432cc Matchless Charlie with an average speed of 38.21 mph and a time of 4 hours 8 minutes 8 seconds. Harry did not finish in 1907, but won in 1909, and Charlie won again in 1910, bringing Matchless motorcycles to the attention of the public.. Collier's other son Harry won the Isle of Man TT in 1909. Both brothers were also successful at Brooklands.
They produced a JAP V-twin powered bike in 1905 which boasted one of the earliest swing-arm rear suspensions, coupled with leading-link front forks. Matchless made mostly singles, but they also made V-twins from 496 cc to 998 cc. They made their own engines from 1912 on.
Matchless was not given a contract to make motorcycles for the army during the First World War. Peacetime production resumed in 1919, concentrating at first on V-twins for sidecar use, leaving singles until 1923. 
When Henry Collier died in 1926 the company he started went on to become one of the most successful British motorcycle marques.

Hambleton Junction

Hambleton Junction is a grade-separated railway junction near Selby, North Yorkshire, England, which connects the East Coast Main Line with the Leeds to Selby Line.
The junction was opened in 1983 as part of the Selby Diversion, which diverted the East Coast Main Line away from the Selby coalfield. The Leeds to Selby Line passes over the East Coast Main Line on a bridge. Sharply-curved chords allow southbound trains on the East Coast Main Line to head eastwards towards Selby (and vice versa), and eastbound trains heading away from Leeds to join the southbound East Coast Main Line (and vice versa).
The junction is regularly used by Northern Rail services between York and Selby.
At present only the East Coast Main Line running under the junction is electrified, however previous east coast rail operator GNER proposed electrifying the Leeds to Selby Line as far as this junction and its east-south chord. Though GNER lost its franchise in 2007, electrification of the line appears to be part of the plans for East Leeds Parkway station which was allocated funding in April 2008.

<doc id="19620164" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19620164" title="Gobannium">
Gobannium

Gobannium was a Roman fort and civil settlement or Castra established by the Roman legions invading what was to become Roman Wales and lies today under the market town of Abergavenny, Monmouthshire in south east Wales.
Documentary evidence.
Gobannium was first recorded in the Antonine Itinerary of the late 2nd century AD as 'Gobannio' sited some 12 miles from Burrium, (modern Usk) and 22 miles south of Magnis (now Kenchester, Herefordshire). Gobannium is also mentioned in the Ravenna Cosmography as 'Bannio', sited between Isca Augusta the major legionary fortress covering South Wales (Caerleon) further down the River Usk, and Bremia (Llanio, Ceredigion).
The name is thought to have a Celtic or Brythonic language origin and linked to Gobannus and Gofannon and may mean 'the place of the blacksmiths'.
Location.
Gobannium lies in the broad valley of the River Usk surrounded by hills and mountains, such as the Sugar Loaf Mountain, Wales, the Skirrid and the Blorenge, just before the valley narrows and the site has some archaeological evidence of human activity dating from the British Iron Age and earlier British Bronze Age. The valley was certainly used as a major prehistoric route through the land of the Silures between the coastal plain of the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels and the Brecon Beacons.
The invading Romans, under Publius Ostorius Scapula, needed a suitable staging post at this site between their major legionary bases and a string of forts in the interior, such as Y Gaer, Brecon and with links northwards to Watling Street, eastwards to Blestium (Monmouth) and Glevum (Gloucester).
Site.
The Romans selected a spur forming a steep incline above the nearby River Usk at a point where the smaller River Gavenny meets it - a naturally defensible site that may well have been settled or fortified previously and that commands clear views across the surrounding landscape. Level ground on the spur offered the scope for a fort layout and subsequently space for an additional civil settlement.
Artefacts and excavations.
Artefacts from the site include stamped roof tiles showing the stamp of the Legio II Augusta, based at Isca Augusta, well worn Roman currency such as a coin from the Augustan period, sixteen pieces of high status Samian ware pottery sherds, items of bronze military equipment compatible with Celtic Roman auxiliary troops, plus rubbish pits.
The excavations that have taken place have been small in scope and piecemeal, often in the face of redevelopment of buildings and amenities in the modern town centre. Digs in advance of the building of the new post office and telephone exchange in the centre of Abergavenny between 1962 and 1969 found evidence of a military ditch system, timber buildings with postholes, small granaries for storing grain over winters and turf and timber ramparts. Further explorations over the years since 1970 have revealed wattle and daub walling, clay sling or sling shot ammunition and further rubbish pits.
In 2002, a metal detectorist in a field of Pentwyn Triley Farm unearthed an upturned vessel. A zoomorphic handle was found detached at the bottom of the pit. The form of this handle has led to the cup being called the Abergavenny 'Leopard Cup'. It was displayed shortly in Abergavenny and is currently displayed in the National Museum and Galleries Wales (Cardiff). Discussion of its precise origins and usage is ongoing.
Some of the artefacts recovered to date can be seen at Abergavenny Museum within Abergavenny Castle.

SpVgg Landshut

The SpVgg Landshut is a German association football club from the city of Landshut, Bavaria. Both the clubs men and women's football teams have in the past played in the highest state league, the "Bayernliga".
History.
The club was formed in 1919, after the end of the First World War. However, football was already played at this stage in the football departments of the "MTV" and "TV 1861 Landshut". In the early days of the "SpVgg", the club was associated with the later, functioning as its football department.
The club made a brief appearance in the Bezirksliga Bayern (I) in 1932–33, just before this league was dissolved in favour of the new Gauliga Bayern in 1933. It was to be the only top-flight appearance for the "SpVgg Landshut" in its history.
After the Second World War, the "SpVgg" originally played in the Bezirksliga Niederbayern, a local amateur league in Lower Bavaria. The "SpVgg" archived promotion to the Landesliga Bayern in 1948, then the second tier of the league system, below the Oberliga Süd. The league was renamed Amateurliga Bayern in 1950 and became the third tier of the league system. Landshut originally performed reasonably well in the league but declined from 1952 to the point where they were only saved from relegation in 1953 by the split of the league into a northern and a southern division.
The club became part of the Amateurliga Südbayern for the 1953–54 season but its decline continued and it was relegated straight away.
The team continued its existence in the 2nd Amateurliga Niederbayern, below the "Bayernliga", until 1960, when they gained promotion back to the highest Bavarian league. The next three seasons, the club spent in mid-table, until 1963, when the German football league system was reformed and the Amateurliga Bayern went back to a single-division format.
Below the "Bayernliga", three Landesligas were set up and Landshut entered the Landesliga Bayern-Mitte (IV). Until 1968, the club finished generally in the upper half of the table, but in 1968–69, it was relegated to the Bezirksliga, where it played for one season before bouncing back. In 1972–73, it was once more relegated. It returned for one season to the Landesliga in 1977–78, played in the Bezirksliga the season after and finally earned promotion back to the Landesliga in 1979, ending their last stay in the Bezirksliga to date.
After two seasons of mid-table finishes, the club earned the right to enter the Oberliga promotion round through a second place finish in 1981–82, where it succeeded and returned to the "Bayernliga". Landshut remained an unremarkable side in its next seven seasons in this league, except for 1985–86. It also qualified for the DFB Cup 1981-82, losing at home to third division side FV Hassia Bingen, 2–3.
The greatest success for the club came in 1986, when, under coach Karsten Wettberg, the title in the "Bayernliga" was won. This would have entitled the club to take part in the promotion round for the 2nd Bundesliga but for financial reasons, the "SpVgg" declined to apply for a licence and the TSV 1860 München took part instead. The club entered the German amateur football championship instead, usually reserved for Oberliga runners-up, and reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by the VfR Bürstadt.
A second highlight in the clubs history was the DFB Cup 1988-89, which they qualified for. Beating BVL 08 Remscheid 2–3 away, the team advanced to the second round. This was followed by a narrow defeat to Alemannia Aachen, 1–2, this time in Landshut.
After this, the club struggled against relegation in the following seasons and dropped down in 1989. After three seasons in the Landesliga, the club once more returned to the Oberliga on the strength of a runners-up spot in its league. Another eight seasons in the "Bayernliga" followed, a fifth place in 1994 being the highlight. In 2000, the club was relegated once more.
Qualified for the German Cup for a third time, the "SpVgg" hosted Hansa Rostock in 1999–2000. Again the club performed well, losing only 0–2 against the Fußball-Bundesliga side.
Like in the previous two decades, the year ending with 2 meant a second place finish for the club but this time they failed in the promotion round. The season after, the club won the Landesliga for the first time and returned to the Oberliga, for one season, dropping down immediately again.
In the 2011–12 season the team won the Landesliga and earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the new Regionalliga Bayern. While the club was knocked out in the first round by SV Heimstetten it nevertheless qualified for an expanded Bayernliga from 2012.

In October 1921, the "SpVgg" begun building a new ground at "Hammerbach", which was to become their current stadium, the "Hammerbachstadion". It holds 10,000 spectators and has 2,018 seats.

Longridge Circuit was a motor racing circuit built in the former Tootle Heights quarry close to Longridge, Lancashire, England. This circuit may be unique in the world in being the only motor racing track situated in a quarry.
The roads used for the extremely short circuit were already in place when racing started in 1973, although sprint events were held prior to this. Racing continued until 1978 on this 0.43 miles long (0.69 km) circuit, which meant that starters was limited to a maximum of 10.
In 1978 the site was sold, which caused considerable ill-feeling amongst those who organised the sport for both two and four wheels for they were not informed of the impending sale, and consequent loss of the venue as plans for 1979 were being laid.

Zealandia (continent)

Zealandia , also known as Tasmantis or the New Zealand continent, is a nearly submerged continental fragment that sank after breaking away from Australia 60–85 Ma (million years ago), having separated from Antarctica between 85 and 130 Ma. It may have been completely submerged about 23 million years ago, and most of it (93%) remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean.
Description.
Zealandia is in area, larger than Greenland or India, and almost half the size of Australia. It is unusually slender, stretching from New Caledonia in the north to beyond New Zealand's sub-Antarctic islands in the south (from latitude 19° south to 56° south, analogous to ranging from Haiti to Hudson Bay or from Sudan to Sweden in the northern hemisphere). New Zealand is the largest part of Zealandia above sea level, followed by New Caledonia.
The major submerged parts of Zealandia are the Lord Howe Rise, Challenger Plateau, Campbell Plateau, Norfolk Ridge, and the Chatham Rise. Smaller provinces include the Louisiade Plateau, Mellish Rise, Kenn Plateau, Chesterfield Plateau, and Dampier Ridge. The seemingly separate Gilbert Seamount (northwest of Fiordland) is also part of the New Zealand continental fragment, while how strongly Bollons Seamount (south of the Chatham Islands) remains connected to Zealandia is unknown.
Zealandia supports substantial inshore fisheries and contains New Zealand's largest gas field, near Taranaki. Permits for oil exploration in the Great South Basin were issued in 2007. Offshore mineral resources include iron sands, volcanic massive sulfides and ferromanganese nodule deposits.
Geology.
Zealandia is largely made up of two nearly parallel ridges, separated by a failed rift, where the rift breakup of the continent stops and becomes a filled graben. The ridges rise above the sea floor to heights of , with infrequent rocky islands rising above sea level. The ridges are continental rock, but are lower in elevation than normal continents because their crust is thinner than usual, approximately thick, and consequently they do not float as high above the Earth's mantle.
About 25 Ma, the southern part of Zealandia (on the Pacific Plate) began to shift relative to the northern part (on the Indo-Australian Plate). The resulting displacement by approximately along the Alpine Fault is evident in geological maps. Movement along this plate boundary has also offset the New Caledonia Basin from its previous continuation through the Bounty Trough.
Compression across the boundary has uplifted the Southern Alps, although due to rapid erosion their height reflects only a small fraction of the uplift. Further north, subduction of the Pacific Plate has led to extensive volcanism, including the Coromandel and Taupo Volcanic Zones. Associated rifting and subsidence has produced the Hauraki Graben and more recently the Whakatane Graben and Wanganui Basin.
Volcanism on Zealandia has also taken place repeatedly in various parts of the continental fragment before, during and after it rifted away from the supercontinent Gondwana. Although Zealandia has shifted approximately to the northwest with respect to the underlying mantle from the time when it rifted from Antarctica, recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibits magma composition similar to that of volcanoes in previously adjacent parts of Antarctica and Australia. 
This volcanism is widespread across Zealandia but generally of low volume apart from the huge mid to late Miocene shield volcanoes that developed the Banks and Otago Peninsulas. In addition, it took place continually in numerous limited regions all through the Late Cretaceous and the Cenozoic. However, its causes are still in dispute. During the Miocene, the northern section of Zealandia (Lord Howe Rise) might have slid over a stationary hotspot, forming the Lord Howe seamount chain.
Biogeography.
New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent, while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the Antarctic Flora, including Araucarias and Podocarps. At Curio Bay, logs of a fossilized forest closely related to modern Kauri and Norfolk Pine can be seen that grew on Zealandia about 180 million years ago during the Jurassic period, before it split from Gondwana. These were buried by volcanic mud flows and gradually replaced by silica to produce the fossils now exposed by the sea.
During glacial periods, more of Zealandia becomes a terrestrial rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land mammal fauna, but a recent discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw from the Miocene in the Otago region shows otherwise.

GWR 4073 Class 7028 Cadbury Castle

Number 7028 "Cadbury Castle" was a Great Western Railway 4073 "Castle" class 4-6-0 steam locomotive built at the former GWR Swindon Works on 19 May 1950. The Castle Class locomotives were built as express passenger locomotives on the GWR. The Castle Class locomotives were to replace the earlier 4000 "Star" class locomotives. They were designed by the railway's Chief Mechanical Engineer, Charles Collett. "Cadbury Castle" cost £10,546 and an extra £1,094 for her Hawksworth tender.
7028's working life.
"Cadbury Castle" was based at Landore, Swansea for 11 years. She worked normal passenger express trains around GWR's network. On the 31 October 1961 she was moved to Llanelli and fitted with a double chimney and a 4 row superheater. She worked at Llanelli for a further two years before being withdrawn on 28 December 1963. By this time in her 13 years of service her mileage was . On 19 March 1964, she was scrapped by Balborough Metals Ltd, Briton Ferry, Swansea. It is worth noting that although "Cadbury Castle" was of GWR design, she only served with BR, as she was built 2 years after the railways were nationalised.
The Western Pullman.
"Cadbury Castle" formed part of a Hornby model railways train set, "The Western Pullman". In this set "Cadbury Castle" was featured with four Pullman carriages and part of Hornby's Track Pack system. This set has ceased production now and has been replaced by "Whittington Castle" in the new DCC set.

Thomas Bilson

Thomas Bilson (1547 – 18 June 1616) was an Anglican Bishop of Worcester and Bishop of Winchester. With Miles Smith, he oversaw the final edit and printing of the "King James Bible". He is buried in Westminster Abbey in plot 232 between the tombs of Richard the Second and Edward the Third. On top of his gravestone there is a small rectangular blank brass plate — the original plate was removed in order to preserve it and is on display on the floor against the wall between the tombs of Richard ll and Edward lll and says the following:—

Translation:— Here lies Thomas Bilson formerly bishop of Winchester and counsellor in sacred matters of his serene highness King James of Great Britain who when he had served God and the church for nineteen years in the bishopric laid aside mortality in certain hope of resurrection 18 June 1616 aged 69.
Life.
Years under the Tudors (1547–1603).
According to the original 'Dictionary of the National Biography' (founded in 1882 by George Smith and edited by both Sir Leslie Stephen who was Virginia Woolf’s father, and Sir Sidney Lee) Thomas Bilson was the eldest son of Herman Bilson, grandson of Arnold Bilson, whose wife is said to have been a daughter of the Duke of Bavaria. Later editions highlight that William Twisse was a nephew. Bilson was educated at the twin foundations of William de Wykeham, Winchester College and New College, Oxford. He began to distinguish himself as a poet until, on receiving ordination, he gave himself wholly to theological studies. He was soon made Prebendary of Winchester, and headmaster of the College there until 1579 and Warden from 1581 to 1596. His pupils there included John Owen, and Thomas James, whom he influenced in the direction of patristics. In 1596, he was made Bishop of Worcester, where he found Warwick uncomfortably full of recusant Roman Catholics. For appointment in 1597 to the wealthy see of Winchester, he paid a £400 annuity to Elizabeth I.
As the Bishop of Winchester, Thomas Bilson would have resided at Winchester Palace, where today in Clink Street, Southwark, London SE1 — there is only one remaining wall of the palace — with a magnificent rose window measuring thirteen feet across. However, back in the sixteenth century, Winchester Palace was a splendorous site and would have looked very similar to the waterfront house of ‘Sir Robert De Lesseps’ depicted in the film "‘Shakespeare in Love’". The 700 acre Bishoprick ‘see’ and jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester included an area known as — ‘The Liberty of Clink’ Southwark, Bankside — which in addition to having a prison (‘The Clink’) also provided the site of many of the major theatres of the day, namely:
— ‘The Rose’ built in 1587 in Rose Lane where Philip Henslowe was the lessee; 
— ‘The Swan’ built in 1596 by Francis Langley in Paris Garden; 
— ‘The Globe’ re-built in 1598 by James Burbage and William Shakespeare; (a year after Thomas Bilson became the Bishop of Winchester) and — ‘The Hope’ built in 1613 by Philip Henslowe in Bear Garden.
Southwark on the south bank of the river Thames in London was very much a cash generator in those days. (Back in the sixteenth century, Southwark was in many ways like a prototype Las Vegas.) In addition to the theatres, Southwark, Bankside was also a ‘red light’ district renowned for its brothels and contained an unconsecrated graveyard for the corpses of women who had worked in them. Far from condemning the brothels, the respective bishops of Winchester, Thomas Bilson included, drew up a set of rules for their regulation and opening hours. In addition to prostitution and pick pockets, the area was also renowned for its gambling dens, skittle alleys and bear/bull baiting, most of which were run by Philip Henslowe (1550-1616) who married a wealthy widow by the name of Agnes Woodward in 1579 and it is thought that with her money Henslowe had managed to acquire interests in numerous brothels, inns, lodging houses and was also involved in dyeing, starch making and wood selling as well as pawnbroking, money lending and theatrical enterprises. With regard to his relationship with actors and playwrights Henslowe wrote in his diary:—“Should these fellowes come out of my debt I should have no rule over them.” Although Philip Henslowe was undoubtedly the main operational manager and entrepreneur behind many of Southwark’s and the ‘see of Winchester’s’ cash generating entertainment enterprises — all taxes from these activities had to be paid to Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester. Indeed in the London Public Record Office is an entry relating to William Shakespeare’s unpaid tax, and carrying the annotation ‘Ep(iscop)o Winton(ensi)’ (to the Bishop of Winchester) — (*The Public Record Office, Exchequer, Lord Treasurers Remembrancer, Pipe Rolls, E.372/444, m. Dated 6 October 1600.) — which has led historians such as Ian Wilson in his 1993 book ‘Shakespeare the Evidence’ to surmise that perhaps William Shakespeare was living within the bishopric ‘see’ of Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester at this time. However somewhat curiously, William Shakespeare’s name does not appear in the church wardens’ annual lists of those residents registered as having attended compulsory Easter Communion. The church wardens annual lists of residents and the compulsory attendance of Easter Communion — in effect the commencement of the new year within the Julian Calendar — provided the paranoid bureaucratic authorities — fearful of Jesuit and Catholic uprisings with a detailed census as to the political status of its citizens and as a means to assess their military and tax obligations. William Shakespeare’s omission from this list and the reference to Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester implies ‘a relationship’ between these two men which has hitherto been unexplained. — Indeed, the commonality of both men being to a large extent historical enigmas is curious in itself.
Thomas engaged in most of the polemical contests of his day, as a stiff partisan of the Church of England. In 1585, he published his "The True Difference Betweene Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion". This work took aim at the Jesuits and replied to Cardinal William Allen's "Defence of the English Catholics" (Ingoldstadt, 1584). It was also a theoretical work on the "Christian commonwealth" and it enjoyed publishing success. Some historians have stated that the immediate purpose of "True Difference" was as much to justify Dutch Protestants resisting Philip II of Spain, as to counter the Jesuits' attacks on Elizabeth I. Glenn Burgess considers that in "True Difference" Bilson shows a sense of the diversity of "legitimate" political systems. He conceded nothing to popular sovereignty, but said that there were occasions when a king might forfeit his powers. According to James Shapiro, he "does his best to walk a fine line", in discussing 'political icons', i.e. pictures of the monarch.
Theological controversy.
A theological argument over the Harrowing of Hell led to several attacks on Bilson personally in what is now called the Descensus controversy. Bilson's literal views on the descent of Christ into Hell were orthodox for "conformist" Anglicans of the time, while the Puritan wing of the church preferred a metaphorical or spiritual reading. He maintained that Christ went to hell, not to suffer, but to wrest the keys of hell out of the Devil’s hands. For this doctrine he was severely handled by Henry Jacob and also by other Puritans. Hugh Broughton, a noted Hebraist, was excluded from the translators of the King James Bible, and became a vehement early critic. The origin of Broughton's published attack on Bilson as a scholar and theologian, from 1604, is thought to lie in a sermon Bilson gave in 1597, which Broughton, at first and wrongly, thought supported his own view that hell and paradise coincided in place. From another direction the Roman Catholic controversialist Richard Broughton also attacked Anglican conformists through Bilson's views, writing in 1607. Much feeling was excited by the controversy, and Queen Elizabeth, in her ire, commanded Bilson, "neither to desert the doctrine, nor let the calling which he bore in the Church of God, be trampled under foot, by such unquiet refusers of truth and authority."
Bilson's most famous work was entitled "The Perpetual Government of Christ's Church" and was published in 1593. It was a systematic attack on Presbyterian polity and an able defence of Episcopal polity. Following on from John Bridges, the work is still regarded as one of the strongest books ever written in behalf of episcopacy.
Courtier to James I (1603–1616).
Bilson gave the sermon at the coronation on 25 July 1603 of James VI of Scotland as James I of England. While the wording conceded something to the divine right of kings, it also included a caveat about lawful resistance to a monarch. This theme was from Bilson's 1585 book, and already sounded somewhat obsolescent.
At the Hampton Court Conference of 1604, he and Richard Bancroft implored King James to change nothing in the Church of England. He had in fact advised James in 1603 not to hold the Conference, and to leave religious matters to the professionals. The advice might have prevailed, had it not been for Patrick Galloway, Moderator of the Scottish Assembly. Later, in charge of the "Authorized Version", he composed the front matter with Miles Smith, his share being the dedication.
He bought the manor of West Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, in 1605. Later, in 1613, he acquired the site of Durford Abbey, Rogate, Sussex.
He was "ex officio" Visitor of St John's College, Oxford, and so was called to intervene when in 1611 the election as President of William Laud was disputed, with a background tension of Calvinist versus Arminian. The other candidate was John Rawlinson. Bilson, taken to be on the Calvinist side, found that the election of the high-church Laud had failed to follow the college statutes. He in the end ruled in favour of Laud, but only after some intrigue: Bilson had difficulty in having his jurisdiction recognised by the group of Laud's activists, led unscrupulously by William Juxon. Laud's party had complained, to the King, who eventually decided the matter himself, leaving the "status quo", and instructed Bilson.
Final years.
He was appointed a judge in the 1613 annulment case of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex and his wife Frances née Howard; with John Buckridge, bishop of Rochester, he was one of two extra judges added by the King to the original 10, who were deadlocked. This caused bitterness on the part of George Abbot, the archbishop of Canterbury, who was presiding over the nullity commission. Abbot felt that neither man was impartial, and that Bilson bore him an old grudge. Bilson played a key role in the outcome, turning away the Earl of Essex's appeal to appear a second time before the commission, and sending away Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton who was asking on behalf of Essex with a half-truth about the position (which was that the King had intervened against Essex). The outcome of the case was a divorce, and Bilson was then in favour with Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, a favourite in the court who proceeded to marry Frances. Bilson's son, the lawyer Sir Thomas Bilson (1579–1630), was nicknamed "Sir Nullity Bilson", because his knighthood followed on the outcome of the Essex annulment case.
In August 1615 Bilson was made a member of the Privy Council. In fact, though this was the high point of Bilson's career as courtier, and secured by Somerset's influence, he had been led to expect more earlier that summer. Somerset had been importunate to the point of pushiness on behalf of Bilson, hoping to secure him a higher office, and had left Bilson in a false position and James very annoyed. This misjudgement was a major step in Somerset's replacement in favour by George Villiers, said to have happened in physical terms under Bilson's roof at Farnham Castle that same August. Bilson died in 1616 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
Legacy.
It was said of him, that he "carried prelature in his very aspect." Anthony Wood proclaimed him so "complete in divinity, so well skilled in languages, so read in the Fathers and Schoolmen, so judicious is making use of his readings, that at length he was found to be no longer a soldier, but a commander in chief in the spiritual warfare, especially when he became a bishop!" Bilson is also remembered for being hawkish against recusant Roman Catholics. Henry Parker drew on both Bilson and Richard Hooker in his pamphlet writing around the time of English Civil War.
Bilson had argued for resistance to a Roman Catholic prince. A century later, Richard Baxter drew on Bilson in proposing and justifying the deposition of James II. What Bilson had envisaged in 1585 was a "wild" scenario or counterfactual, a Roman Catholic monarch of England: its relevance to practical politics came much later.
Writings.
His writings took a nuanced and middle way in ecclesiastical polity, and avoided Erastian views and divine right, while requiring passive obedience to authority depending on the context. His efforts to avoid condemning Huguenot and Dutch Protestant resisters have been described as "contortions". His works included:

Kazakhstania

Kazakhstania, also known as the Kazakhstan Block, is a small continental region in the interior of Asia. It consists of the area north and east of the Aral Sea, south of the Siberian craton and west of the Altai Mountains and Lake Balkhash. Politically, it comprises most of Kazakhstan and has a total area of around 1.3 million km². The Junggar basin in Xinjiang, China is also part of Kazahstania, though sometimes referred to as the Junggar Block.
It is believed that present-day Kazakhstania is chiefly a mélange of early Paleozoic volcanic island arcs and some small continental terranes. These were joined together during the Ordovician to form what was at the time an isolated continent of its own. During the Carboniferous and Permian, Siberia collided with Kazakhstania to form the Altai Mountains, later Baltica collided in the Ural orogeny, creating the basis for most of present-day Eurasia.
Kazakhstania is mainly flat: only in the east near Karaganda are there mountains and these only rise to 1,565 metres (5,130 feet) in the Tarbagatay Range. Although most of Kazakhstania is arid and practically no water flows from the region to the oceans, there is extensive grazing of cattle, sheep and camels on the grasslands which cover most of the region today. Kazakhstania was too dry for extensive glaciation during the Quaternary. Kazakhstania contains as much as a quarter of the world's proven uranium reserves and is also one of the world's major source of lead, zinc, and antimony ores. On the southern boundary in the Turan Depression are large deposits of natural gas formed as a result of its collision with the Indian plate.

Strasbourg-Ortenau Eurodistrict

Strasbourg-Ortenau is a Franco-German eurodistrict, a cross-border administrative entity ("groupement européen de coopération transfrontalière") sharing common institutions, established on 17 October 2005 and definitely functional since 4 February 2010. The district is formed by the Urban Community of Strasbourg (centred on the city of Strasbourg) and 3 other urban communities (of Rhinau, Erstein and Benfeld) on the French side of the Rhine and the Ortenau district (including Achern, Kehl, Lahr, Oberkirch and Offenburg) on the German side. The combined population of the district is 931,760 (2009/2010). It covers an area of 2,445 km².
Building on regional and Franco-German cooperation, it aims to develop bonds between citizens, associations, public administrations, educational establishments and corporations. It is also in the context of European integration, with the presence of European institutions in Strasbourg, and has been compared to a European version of Washington D.C.. In addition to the array of European and Franco-German institutions, the district includes three ports, two airports and nine universities.
The Eurodistrict's Council is composed of 48 members, with 24 each representing either the French or the German side.
History.
The idea of a eurodistrict Strasbourg-Kehl (as it was called then) was officially launched on 22 January 2003, by then-French President Jacques Chirac and then-German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder during a meeting in the Élysée Palace; it was point 24 of the common declaration made on the 40th anniversary of the cooperation treaty between Germany and France. 22 January was furthermore declared "French-German day" ("journée franco-allemande", "deutsch-französischer Tag")
A common resolution to create the Strasbourg-Ortenau Eurodistrict was signed on 24 May 2003 in Offenburg by Fabienne Keller, the mayor of Strasbourg, Robert Grossmann, the president of the Communauté urbaine de Strasbourg, the mayors of Kehl, Offenburg, Achern, Lahr and Oberkirch as well as the President ("Landrat") of the Ortenau district. The resolution's aim was to present a viable version of the project at the upcoming French-German summit on 10 June 2003.
On 30 June 2003, the French minister for European Affairs, Noëlle Lenoir, and her German colleague, Hans Martin Bury, signed the official document specifying the legal, political, economical, demographic etc. frameworks ("cadres") within which the Eurodistrict was to be called into existence. The document also announced that further presentations of the project were to be made at the French-German summit in the following autumn, as well as during the crossborder flower festival on both banks of the Rhine held in Strasbourg and Kehl in the spring 2004.
Mayor of Strasbourg Roland Ries, during and after his election campaign in 2007, proposed the strengthening of the district in order to maintain the presence of the European Parliament in the city (see Location of European Union institutions) and making it more autonomous and akin to a European capital territory. However the Ortenaukreis communities have been less enthusiastic about the Eurodistrict project. In late January 2010 the German State definitely greenlighted the entity and the inaugural session of the Eurodistrict's Council took place on 4 February 2010. Roland Ries was elected as the Council's first president.

Ur (continent)

Ur was a supercontinent that formed (3 billion) in the early Archean eon; perhaps the oldest continent on Earth, half a billion years older than Arctica, but it may have been preceded by one other supercontinent, Vaalbara, which is suggested to have formed about . Ur joined with the continents Nena and Atlantica about (1 billion) to form the supercontinent Rodinia. Ur survived as a single unit until it was sundered when the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart into Laurasia and Gondwana.
Formation and breakup.
Rocks that made up Ur are now parts of Africa, Australia, and India.
In the early period of Ur's existence, it was probably the only continent on Earth. Thus Ur is considered to be a supercontinent, even though it was probably smaller than Australia is now. Current day New Zealand has a vague resemblance to Ur, but rotated 90 degrees out of phase, and is about 1000 km too far South. When Ur was the only continent on Earth, all other land was in the form of small granite islands and small land-masses like Kenorland that were not large enough to be continents.

Japanese minelayer Okinoshima

Building.
Following the ratification of the London Naval Treaty, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to retire its existing obsolete minelayers, the former cruisers , and . A replacement was budgeted under the "Maru-1" Supplementary Naval Expansion Budget of 1931. The new vessel was to be of unprecedented size, thus overcoming the shortcomings of previous minelayers in the Japanese inventory in terms of range and capacity. In addition to carrying 600 Type 6 naval mines, the new ship had the same guns as were used on the , and also was equipped with an aircraft catapult, and a Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance seaplane.
"Okinoshima" was launched by the Harima shipyards of Ishikawajima-Harima in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan on November 14, 1935, and was commissioned into service on September 30, 1936.
Operational history.
During the late 1930s, "Okinoshima" was assigned as flagship of a destroyer squadron, and made numerous survey missions to the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands and Marianas in the Japanese South Seas Mandate, seeking potential sites for seaplane bases, and transporting naval mines for future use.
At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, "Okinoshima" was serving as flagship for Admiral Kiyohide Shima in "Operation Gi" (the invasion of the Gilbert Islands) and had deployed from Jaluit with a Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) embarked. From 9–10 December, "Okinoshima" supported the Japanese landings on Makin and on Tarawa, and on 24 December, the seizure of Abaiang. "Okinoshima" was at Truk on 1 January 1942.
In January 1942, under the overall command of Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka, "Okinoshima" participated in "Operation R" (the invasion of Rabaul) landing Japanese troops at Blanche Bay, Rabaul on the night of 22/23 January 1942. On 1 February, "Okinoshima" was officially re-assigned to the South Seas Force.
On 5 March, "Okinoshima", under the overall command of Admiral Kuninori Marumo, was assigned to "Operation SR" (the invasion of Lae and Salamaua in New Guinea). On 10 March, the invasion force was attacked by United States Navy aircraft from and , with "Okinoshima" suffering light damage.
After repairs at Truk, on 28 April "Okinoshima" was appointed flagship for Admiral Shima's Tulagi invasion force, which was part of "Operation Mo" (the invasion of Tulagi and Port Moresby in New Guinea). The Tulagi assault force began their landings on Tulagi on 3 May, with "Okinoshima" successfully landing troops of the Kure 3rd SNLF. However, the invasion force was attacked on 4 May by aircraft from the USS "Yorktown". Several transports and the destroyer , were sunk and "Okinoshima" suffered from a near miss, which resulted in her being towed to Rabaul for repairs.
Fate.
On 10 May, "Okinoshima" departed Rabaul as part of "Operation RY", the invasion of Nauru and Ocean Island. On 12 May 1942, off New Ireland, she was hit by two or three torpedoes by American submarine USS "S-42". "Okinoshima" was taken under tow by escorting destroyer , but capsized in St. George's Channel, in the Bismarck Sea at position . Most of the crew survived. 
"Okinoshima" was removed from the navy list on 25 May 1942.

Deep Purple in Rock

Deep Purple in Rock (also known as In Rock) is the fourth album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in June 1970. It was their fourth studio album and the first with the classic Mk II lineup. Rod Evans (vocals) and Nick Simper (bass) had been fired in June 1969 and were replaced by Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, respectively.
"Deep Purple in Rock" was their breakthrough album in Europe and would peak at #4 in the UK, remaining in the charts for months. (The band's prior MK I albums had been much better received in North America than in their homeland.) The album was supported by the hugely successful In Rock World Tour which lasted 15 months.
Although this was the first studio album to feature the MK II lineup of the band, it was this lineup that had earlier recorded the live "Concerto for Group and Orchestra". The album was also preceded by two singles, the first studio recordings that Gillan made with Deep Purple. The first single, released in 1969, was a Greenaway-Cook composition called "Hallelujah", which flopped. The second single, "Black Night", fared much better as it rose all the way to #2 on the UK charts.
In 2005 the album won the Classic Rock and Roll of Honour Award (given by the British monthly magazine " Classic Rock") in the category Classic Album. The award was presented to Ian Gillan, Ian Paice and Jon Lord.
Change in direction.
Deep Purple's earlier work ranged from psychedelic hard rock to orchestra-driven tracks and covers that ranged from The Beatles to Neil Diamond, among others, but on this record all tracks are credited to the five members of the band. 
Jon Lord used both the Leslie speaker and a Marshall amplifier with his Hammond organ, therefore the organ sound varies a lot throughout the songs. (Example: "Living Wreck" – Leslie speaker, "Hard Lovin' Man" – Marshall amplifier).
Ritchie Blackmore used a Gibson ES-335 guitar on "Child in Time", not his usual Fender Stratocaster. This album is his favorite, along with "Machine Head".
The cover depicts the band in a rock sculpture inspired by Mount Rushmore.
Later editions.
In some countries, including Mexico, "Deep Purple in Rock" also included "Black Night", a single recorded during the sessions.
The US release of the album cut the intro to "Speed King", lasting just over a minute. It remains edited on the standard Warner Bros. US release, but is restored to full length on the 25th anniversary package.
In 1995 a remastered and revised 25th anniversary edition of the album was released by EMI. The remastering and remixing job was overseen by Roger Glover. The album features a number of bonus songs including previously unreleased jams. In 2013 this particular edition of the album turned Gold in the UK.
On 21 July 2009 audiophile label Audio Fidelity released a remastered version of "Deep Purple in Rock" on a limited edition 24 karat gold CD. Mastering for the CD was performed by Steve Hoffman. This release follows the original 7-track format with no bonus tracks.
Track listing.
All songs written by Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord and Ian Paice.
Song information.
As the liner notes for the LP allude ("A few roots…replanted"), "Speed King" is an ode to early rock-and-roll, with frequent references to songs performed by Little Richard ("Good Golly Miss Molly", "Tutti-Frutti" and "Lucille"), as well as Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. The original UK version of the album includes the full introductory instrumental, featuring a loud free-form Blackmore guitar passage blending into a quieter Lord organ piece, but the U.S. version did not include the intro. The hard-rocking song features a midsection "call-and-answer" solo exchange between Blackmore and Lord, which presaged their live performances for years to come; it was regularly played at concerts during the Mark II era, starting as an opener, but more frequently performed as an encore. It was also the b-side of the non-album single "Black Night".
Another hard rocker featuring a midsection exchange between Blackmore and Lord, with Gillan literally screaming out the final verse. The Mark VII version of Deep Purple (featuring Steve Morse on guitar) re-recorded this song on their 1998 release "Abandon", with the revised title of "Bludsucker".
Considered one of the epic songs of the Mark II era, especially prior to the release of the iconic "Smoke on the Water" in 1972, "Child in Time" goes from quiet sadness to bombastic rocker and back again in a track running over 10 minutes. Lord’s organ is most prominent in the quieter parts, as he plays a chord structure inspired by (some say, "stolen from") a song by It's a Beautiful Day titled "Bombay Calling." In return It's a Beautiful Day recorded "Wring that Neck" from Deep Purple and called it "Don and Dewey". Gillan’s vocals start out softly, evolve into howling and lastly demonstrate his ability to "scream in tune". Blackmore then launches into a guitar solo running over two minutes, before the first verse repeats and the song comes to a crashing end. It would be a concert staple for every version of Deep Purple that included Gillan, up until the singer's voice could no longer support it.
Ian Gillan tells on his homepage (www.gillan.com/wordography): ""It was 1969 and the band was rehearsing at a Community Centre in West London; it was either Southall or Hanwell. Jon Lord was dicking around (or 'extemporising on a theme' as it's known in the trade) with a tune from the new album by 'It's a Beautiful Day', it was 'Bombay Calling'. I started singing and the words came easily because we were all aware of the nuclear threat which hovered over us at this time which was probably when the 'cold war' was at its hottest.""
A hard rock song featuring a straight-ahead structure of three main power chords. Unlike the call-and-answer solo structure of "Speed King" and "Bloodsucker", Blackmore and Lord are each accorded their own extended solos on this song. This song was never performed live.
This song was used in the movie "The Damned United".
A staple of early Mark II concerts, the song starts with a hooky introductory riff and two main chords which are octaves of each other. Features a phased and unusually slow guitar solo by Ritchie Blackmore.
A straight-ahead rocker that tells the story of a love affair that fails miserably to live up to expectations.
Two power chords kick off the album’s closer, before Glover’s bass provides the rhythmic intro. Blackmore’s guitar is folded in, then Paice and Lord join in before the vocals start. 
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah is the first single recorded by Deep Purple Mk.2 line-up. It was released in 1969.

Ninaithale Inikkum (2009 film)

Ninaithale Inikkum is a 2009 Tamil mystery-drama film directed by Kumaravelan. It stars Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shakthi Vasudevan, Priyamani, Karthik Kumar and Anuja Iyer in the lead roles while K. Bhagyaraj and Manobala play supporting roles. The score was composed by Vijay Antony.
"Ninaithale Inikkum" was released on September 4, 2009 and was an average grosser but was later on declared a super-hit at the box office. The film was produced by Gemini Film Circuit and distributed by Sun Pictures. The plot is a remake of the 2006 Malayalam film "Classmates" while the title was taken from a 1979 Tamil film.
Plot.
The young college-going Shiva (Prithviraj Sukumaran) is extremely energetic and enthusiastic. Being very short tempered, he gets easily provoked by the rich, proud Vasu (Karthik Kumar) and his sneering attitude. From glares and snarls to punches and fights, Vasu and Shiva do it all, even for unreasonable, petty things. It is Shakthi (Shakthi Vasudevan) who stops their quarrels before they injure each other very badly. As he is friendly, kind-hearted and cool-headed, Shakthi tries to bring Shiva and Vasu together on friendly terms but in vain. Shiva, Shakthi and their faithful friend Bala stay together through thick and thin and are always ready to voice out their views on behalf of the hostelites in the college. Shakthi’s father (Bhagyaraj) often visits his son in the hostel and is like a father to all of Shakthi’s friends. Meera (Priyamani), the daughter of an M.L.A., nurtures a soft corner for Shiva. She is brave enough to stand up to him and check him when he throws unnecessary tantrums. Shalini (Anuja Iyer), Meera’s friend, is a shy, reserved Muslim girl from a very strict family background. She is often preoccupied with her own thoughts. Karthik (Jeeva) is a total show-off who tries to humiliate Shiva and Shakthi but ends up making a fool of himself.
The movie begins on an aeroplane as Shiva (a mature looking Prithviraj, with a French beard and rimless spectacles) heads back to his college to meet his friends. With his eyes sparkling with nostalgic memories, he takes a trip down memory lane and what he recalls about his college days forms the main part of the story.
At the reunion, the friends are happy to see each other after eight long years. But they all seem to be weighed down by a tragic incident: the death of Shakti. Shiva remains the most melancholic of them all. All goes well, until Shiva is found almost strangled to death. Everyone suspects Vasu, but Shakti's father discovers that the murder was attempted by Shalini.
In a flashback, it is revealed that Shakti and Shalini were lovers. In an ultimate twist, Shalini reveals that Shiva, who was running away from the police after breaking into an election booth, killed Shakti with chloroform, as the latter suffered from asthma. Shalini is upset that Shakti's father prevented her from taking revenge against the murderer of his son.
Shiva is cured and comes to seek apology from Shakti's father for accidentally killing Shakti. Shakti's father forgives Shiva and asks Shiva to marry Meera, who has been waiting for him for over eight years. Vasu also comes to seek apology from Shiva for all of his antics in college. Shakti's parents adopt Shalini, whose family has died, and decide to take her home. The film ends as Shalini says farewell to her friends and to the image of Shakti, who is forever present in the college campus. The message of the film goes for all of us: "Never forget the sweet memories that happened in college."
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack, composed by Vijay Antony, features seven songs.
Box Office.
The film declared as superhit at the boxoffice.

Death Race (video game)

Death Race, also known as Death Race 2000 is a controversial arcade game, released by Exidy in the United States in 1976. Approximately 500 copies of the game were made. The game board is one of a very few that does not use a CPU. The game is inspired by the film "Death Race 2000". It is also one of the first games to feature vehicular combat gameplay.
Overview.
In the game, designed by Howell Ivy and inspired by the 1975 cult film "Death Race 2000" directed by Paul Bartel, one or two players control an on-screen car (two cars if two players played) with a steering wheel and an acceleration pedal. The object is to run down "gremlins" who are fleeing the vehicle. As the player hits them, they scream or squeal and are replaced on-screen by tombstones. This increases the challenge of the game as the screen clutters up and the player has to avoid the tombstones.
The cabinet is black with white graphics of a muscle car racing through a cemetery with a vulture in a tree looking on. The marquee and monitor bezel are quite colorful. A limited number had white sides with the artwork in black, instead of the reverse. It was in an upright standard style.
Controversy.
Although the graphics are primitive and monochrome, the "gremlins" resemble stick figures and the game's working title had been "Pedestrian". In spite of Exidy president Pete Kaufman's denial that the intent of the game was to promote violence, "Death Race" provoked media criticism. The National Safety Council called it sick and morbid. The CBS news program "60 Minutes" broadcast an investigation into the psychological impact of video games, and the game was covered on NBC's "Weekend" news show, and in the "National Enquirer" and "Midnight" magazine. "Death Race" is rated on several "most controversial video game" lists.
Legacy.
Exidy released 51 different machines under this trade name, starting in 1974.
Funspot has a working arcade machine in an all yellow cabinet. An original arcade version of "Death Race" is present in the Musée Mécanique in San Francisco, and costs one quarter to play. The Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois received an original black cabinet as a donation.

Lady of all Nations

“The Lady of All Nations” is the name used to describe the series of Marian apparitions to Ida Peerdeman in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Peerdeman allegedly received a total of 207 visions, the first 56 of which involved the Virgin Mary and began on 25 March 1945. After the Marian visions ceased on 31 May 1959, Peerdeman claimed to have received 151 of what she called “Eucharistic Experiences” for 26 years, where she was given divine revelation, usually during Mass.
Ida Peerdeman.
Peerdeman was born on 13 August 1905 in the city of Alkmaar, in the Netherlands. The youngest of five siblings, she was an average woman who worked in a perfume factory, and God was the centre of her life. She said she was aged 40 when the apparitions began on the Feast of the Annunciation. Her confessor, Father Frehe, was visiting the family, and Ida recalled seeing a light from the corner of the room. From it came a woman who revealed herself as the “Lady of All Nations", and instructed her to repeat everything she was told. Ida did so, and Father Frehe ordered her sister to write down every word. This reportedly occurred in 1945, while Nazi Germany still occupied the Netherlands. Ida claimed that she had seen the Virgin Mary as she was huddled by a stove with her sisters and priest chatting about the war and the possibilities of what could happen in the future. Ida suffered attacks both from the Church and, she said, from demons for believing in the apparition of The Lady of All Nations until her death in 1996.
New dogma.
Followers of the Lady of all Nations have asked for a fifth and final Marian dogma of the Co-Redemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate, and cite four dogmas that have preceded it: 
Prayer.
This is the prayer that the Virgin Mary is said to have given to Ida Peerdeman: 
In July 2005, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith required that "who once was Mary" must be left out of the prayer given by The Lady of All Nations. The proper ending to the prayer is now "May the Lady of All Nations, the Blessed Virgin Mary, be our Advocate."

Old German Shepherd Dog

Old German Shepherd Dog (') is a controversial predicate for the long-hair variation of the German Shepherd Dog ('), which is not as an own breed recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. Nonetheless are there efforts to establish this variety as a separated breed.
History.
Under the Society for the German Shepherd Dog the long-haired variation of the German Shepherd was not accepted for a long time. This changed in 2009. In 2010 the long-haired variation was accepted once again. Before that, Breeders of the long-haired variation of the German Shepherd had founded their own Kennel Clubs and had called the long-haired hair variation the "Old German Shepherd". 
Some old German landraces of cattle dogs are also called "Altdeutscher Schäferhund" (Old German Shepherd Dog). To avoid confusion, all of these races are now summarized under the generic term "Altdeutsche Hütehunde" (Old German Herding Dogs).
Appearance.
Most of them appear similar to the long-haired variation of the modern German Shepherd, although with slightly different colouring patterns. The coat may be any length and can be shaggy, smooth or wiry. The colours may be black, brown, grey or tan. They are generally the same height as a typical German Shepherd: at the withers. They weigh between but are known to have been larger.

Allestree Hall

Allestree Hall is a 19th-century former country house situated in Allestree Park, Allestree, Derby. It is a Grade II* listed building but has been unoccupied for many years, and has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register.
The Mundy family owned the Manor of Allestree from 1516 until Francis Noel Clarke Mundy sold it to Thomas Evans in 1781. It was later the home of William Evans and of his son Sir Thomas William Evans, 1st Baronet. On his death in 1892 the latter bequeathed the estate to his brother in law William Gisborne.
The area known as Allestree Park was enclosed in about 1818. The house begun by Bache Thornhill was completed by John Giradot (High Sheriff of Derbyshire) with three storeys and five bays, the central three bowed with an ionic columned porch.
A large part of the estate was sold for housing development in 1928. The neglected house now stands in a park and golf course. Allestree Park is a Local Nature Reserve.

Carola Neher

Carola Neher (November 2, 1900 – June 26, 1942) was a German actress.
Biography.
Neher was born in Munich to a music teacher in 1900. She started to work as a bank clerk in 1917. In the summer of 1920, she made her debut performance at the Baden-Baden theater without a specific stage education, later also working at the theaters of Darmstadt, Nuremberg and at the Munich Kammerspiele. In 1924, Neher started to work at the "Lobe-Theater" Breslau, where she met Therese Giehse and Peter Lorre. On May 7, 1925 she married Alfred Henschke (the poet Klabund), who had followed her from Munich to Breslau, at that time already a well known and successful poet. The first performance of his Circle of Chalk ("Der Kreidekreis") turned into her first great success.
In 1926 Neher went to Berlin to work with Bertolt Brecht. He wrote the role of Polly Peachum in "The Threepenny Opera", but late in rehearsals her husband died at Davos on August 14, 1928. She was therefore unable to appear at the premiere, but acted the role of Polly in the later performances.
Brecht wrote several roles for her like Lilian Holiday in "Happy End" and the title role in his "Saint Joan of the Stockyards". Neher had also great success as Marianne in Ödön von Horváth's "Tales from the Vienna Woods" and embodied and immortalized Polly in G.W. Pabst's film of "The Threepenny Opera".
While in Berlin, Neher practiced boxing with Turkish trainer and prizefighter Sabri Mahir at his studio, which opened to women (including Vicki Baum and Marlene Dietrich) in the 1920s. Posing for a photograph opposite Mahir and equipped with boxing gloves and a maillot, she asserted herself as a “New Woman”, challenging traditional gender categories.
In 1932 she married Anatol Becker and left Germany after Adolf Hitler's ascension to power in spring 1933. She first emigrated to Prague, where she worked at the New German Theater, but went on to the Soviet Union in 1934, where she met Gustav von Wangenheim and worked with him at his German language cabaret Kolonne Links.
In 1936, throughout the Stalinist Great Purge, Wangenheim denounced Neher and her husband, Anatol Becker, as Trotskyites, she was arrested on July 25, 1936. Becker was executed in 1937; Neher was sentenced to ten years in prison and sent to a gulag near Orenburg. She died in the prison there of typhus July 26, 1942.
Her fate caused protests among other emigrants outside the Soviet Union, especially as Bertolt Brecht did not aid Neher.
Remembrance.
The Carola-Neher-Street in Berlin Hellersdorf is named after Neher.

Charlie Lynn

Charlie John Stuart Lynn (born 14 January 1945 in Orbost, Victoria) is an Australian politician and Liberal Party of Australia member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Lynn has been an MLC since 19 October 1995.
Personal history.
Lynn was born to parents Melva and Keith Lynn, and is the eldest of eight siblings. He grew up in a small timber home on the banks of the Snowy River in East Gippsland.
Military service.
Leaving school, he began working in a Country Roads Board camp. In 1965 he was conscripted into the Australian Army, going on to serve his country in the Vietnam War in 1967. After the end of the war, he remained in the Army until 1986 and served in Singapore and the United States. He qualified as a HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) military parachutist with the US Army in 1978. He is a graduate of the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, Victoria and the Army Staff College at Fort Queenscliff, Victoria. He represented the Army in Australian Rules football, tennis, squash and marathon running.
Professional history.
After his discharge from the Army, became a Special Events Organiser. He has organised the Sydney to Melbourne Ultra Marathon, the Anzac Day Marathon, the 18,000 km Round Australia Relay for the Australian Cancer Foundation, the Great Australian Caravan Safari, the Darwin-Cairns-Melbourne Relay for the Melbourne Olympic Committee, and the international George Street Mile footrace.

Charlie has been appointed to the Board of the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway at Concord. He was also recently elected President of the NSW Parliamentary Lions Club and is a Trustee on the Anzac Memorial building in Sydney.
He was Chairman of the Campbelltown Chamber of Commerce and Industry between 1993 and 1994.
Representative history.
Lynn had been the Liberal candidate for the Werriwa by-election of January 1994 in which his ALP opponent was future Opposition Leader Mark Latham. Werriwa is a safe ALP seat and Latham was elected although Lynn succeeded in achieving a swing for the Liberal Party.
While Lynn was never expected to win Werriwa he did come close to being elected to the Federal Parliament when he was preselected as the Liberal candidate for the marginal ALP seat of Macarthur. However supporters of former NSW Liberal Premier John Fahey wanted Fahey to be in the Federal Parliament and Macarthur was the ideal seat for Fahey but Lynn refused to step aside for Fahey.
However a deal was brokered to accommodate both Fahey and Lynn when former State Liberal Minister Ted Pickering had retired from State Parliament. The deal was for Lynn to fill Pickering's Legislative Council seat in return for giving up the Macarthur preselection for Fahey. Lynn accepted the deal and was appointed to the aforementioned casual vacancy in the New South Wales Legislative Council on 19 October 1995 following the resignation of Pickering on 10 October. Fahey went on to win Macarthur at the 1996 Federal election.
Lynn as an MLC first stood for election in his own right in the 1999 New South Wales election. He was placed fourth on the joint Liberal/Nationals election ticket. He was re-elected after receiving the ninth highest quota of votes.
He stood for re-election in 2007 New South Wales election. He was placed first on the joint Liberal/Nationals election ticket. He was re-elected after receiving the second highest quota of votes. On July 28, 2012 Charlie Lynn threatened he would be leaving the Liberal Party to sit in the Legislative Council as an Independent over concerns about the selection of candidates for upcoming local council elections in NSW being endorsed by the Liberal Party. The party chose not to endorse their members in that local council area, as has been practice in the past in some areas.
Controversy.
He was nominated for an Ernie Award for saying "I'm not happy about someone else having my credit card details, it's bad enough that my wife has them.".
Personal life.
A keen fun-runner. He was placed 2nd in the Bathurst Centenary 100 km ultramarathon with a time of 8 hours 26 minutes in 1986 and held the NSW 24-Hour ultramarathon record with a distance of 213 km. He completed the first Triple M Ironman Triathlon in a time of 13 hours and 12 minutes.

Frank Dickens

Frank William Huline Dickens (born 2 February 1932) is a British cartoonist, best known for his strip "Bristow", which ran for 41 years in the "Evening Standard" and was syndicated internationally. According to "Guinness World Records", "Bristow" was the longest running daily cartoon strip by a single author. Dickens has received eight awards for "Strip Cartoonist of the Year" from the Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain.
Career.
Born in Hornsey, London, the son of a painter and decorator, Dickens left school at the age of sixteen and began working for his father. He then took a job as a buying clerk in an engineering firm for three months, before in 1946 deciding to pursue an ambition to become a champion racing cyclist. He moved to Paris after his National Service but failed to make a living at cycling, so he tried to make money by selling cycling cartoons to French magazines, including L'Équipe and Paris-Match. A self-taught artist, he had his first cartoon published in a British national newspaper in the "Sunday Express" on 30 September 1959.[http://www.frankdickens.com/FD/Pages/Cartoons/Cartoons1Page.htm] Work in the "Evening Standard", "Daily Sketch" and "Daily Mirror" followed, and in December 1960 Dickens began a three-month period at the "Sunday Times", where he took his strip "Oddbod". One of the characters in that strip was developed into the bowler-hatted Bristow. The Bristow strip first appeared in regional papers, before being taken up by the "Evening Standard" on 6 March 1962.
In 1971 the Bristow strip was produced on stage at the ICA, London, starring Freddie Jones, and in 1999 Dickens himself adapted it as a six-part series for BBC Radio 4, featuring Michael Williams, Rodney Bewes and Dora Bryan. Anne Karpf observed in "The Guardian": "From cartoon strip to radio series is no longer a large leap, although Frank Dickens's Bristow, about an idle paper-pusher in a large firm, scarcely invites the kind of Superman cartoon radio techniques that have become so familiar. Yet the first in this new Radio 4 series cleverly managed to sound simultaneously knowing and naïf." 
Since 1966 twelve Bristow compilations in book form have been published: by Constable (1966), Allison & Busby (1970), Abelard-Schuman (1972, 1973, 1974, 1975), Futura (1976), Barrie & Jenkins (1978), Penguin Books (1981), Macmillan (1982), and Beaumont Book Company (Australia, 1977, 1978). The most recent is "The Big, Big, Big, Bristow Book" (Little, Brown & Company, 2001).
The strip that brought Dickens greatest financial success, through syndication in the United States, was "Albert Herbert Hawkins: The Naughtiest Boy in the World" - which reportedly captures the "essential naughtiness" of its author.
Dickens has also published several children's books, as well as thrillers connected with bicycle racing: "A Curl Up and Die Day" (Peter Owen Publishers, 1980) and "Three Cheers for the Good Guys" (Macmillan, 1984).
On 2 February 2012, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a tribute to Frank Dickens called "Holy Mackerel – It’s My Life!" to mark his 80th birthday, narrated by Bernard Cribbins and with contributors who included fellow cartoonists Ralph Steadman and Rick Brookes. The programme was repeated on 13 May 2012.

Airy wave theory

In fluid dynamics, Airy wave theory (often referred to as linear wave theory) gives a linearised description of the propagation of gravity waves on the surface of a homogeneous fluid layer. The theory assumes that the fluid layer has a uniform mean depth, and that the fluid flow is inviscid, incompressible and irrotational. This theory was first published, in correct form, by George Biddell Airy in the 19th century.
Airy wave theory is often applied in ocean engineering and coastal engineering for the modelling of random sea states – giving a description of the wave kinematics and dynamics of high-enough accuracy for many purposes.
This linear theory is often used to get a quick and rough estimate of wave characteristics and their effects. This approximation is accurate for small ratios of the wave height to water depth (for waves in shallow water), and wave height to wavelength (for waves in deep water).
Description.
Airy wave theory uses a potential flow (or velocity potential) approach to describe the motion of gravity waves on a fluid surface. The use of – inviscid and irrotational – potential flow in water waves is remarkably successful, given its failure to describe many other fluid flows where it is often essential to take viscosity, vorticity, turbulence and/or flow separation into account. This is due to the fact that for the oscillatory part of the fluid motion, wave-induced vorticity is restricted to some thin oscillatory Stokes boundary layers at the boundaries of the fluid domain.
Airy wave theory is often used in ocean engineering and coastal engineering. Especially for random waves, sometimes called wave turbulence, the evolution of the wave statistics – including the wave spectrum – is predicted well over not too long distances (in terms of wavelengths) and in not too shallow water. Diffraction is one of the wave effects which can be described with Airy wave theory. Further, by using the WKBJ approximation, wave shoaling and refraction can be predicted.
Earlier attempts to describe surface gravity waves using potential flow were made by, among others, Laplace, Poisson, Cauchy and Kelland. But Airy was the first to publish the correct derivation and formulation in 1841. Soon after, in 1847, the linear theory of Airy was extended by Stokes for non-linear wave motion – known as Stokes' wave theory – correct up to third order in the wave steepness. Even before Airy's linear theory, Gerstner derived a nonlinear trochoidal wave theory in 1804, which however is not irrotational.
Airy wave theory is a linear theory for the propagation of waves on the surface of a potential flow and above a horizontal bottom. The free surface elevation "η"("x","t") of one wave component is sinusoidal, as a function of horizontal position "x" and time "t":
where
The waves propagate along the water surface with the phase speed "cp":
The angular wavenumber "k" and frequency "ω" are not independent parameters (and thus also wavelength "λ" and period "T" are not independent), but are coupled. Surface gravity waves on a fluid are dispersive waves – exhibiting frequency dispersion – meaning that each wavenumber has its own frequency and phase speed.
Note that in engineering the wave height "H" – the difference in elevation between crest and trough – is often used:
valid in the present case of linear periodic waves.
Underneath the surface, there is a fluid motion associated with the free surface motion. While the surface elevation shows a propagating wave, the fluid particles are in an orbital motion. Within the framework of Airy wave theory, the orbits are closed curves: circles in deep water, and ellipses in finite depth—with the ellipses becoming flatter near the bottom of the fluid layer. So while the wave propagates, the fluid particles just orbit (oscillate) around their average position. With the propagating wave motion, the fluid particles transfer energy in the wave propagation direction, without having a mean velocity. The diameter of the orbits reduces with depth below the free surface. In deep water, the orbit's diameter is reduced to 4% of its free-surface value at a depth of half a wavelength.
In a similar fashion, there is also a pressure oscillation underneath the free surface, with wave-induced pressure oscillations reducing with depth below the free surface – in the same way as for the orbital motion of fluid parcels.
Mathematical formulation of the wave motion.
Flow problem formulation.
The waves propagate in the horizontal direction, with coordinate "x", and a fluid domain bound above by a free surface at "z" = "η"("x","t"), with "z" the vertical coordinate (positive in the upward direction) and "t" being time. The level "z" = 0 corresponds with the mean surface elevation. The impermeable bed underneath the fluid layer is at "z" = -"h". Further, the flow is assumed to be incompressible and irrotational – a good approximation of the flow in the fluid interior for waves on a liquid surface – and potential theory can be used to describe the flow. The velocity potential "Φ"("x","z","t") is related to the flow velocity components "u""x" and "u""z" in the horizontal ("x") and vertical ("z") directions by:
Then, due to the continuity equation for an incompressible flow, the potential "Φ" has to satisfy the Laplace equation:
Boundary conditions are needed at the bed and the free surface in order to close the system of equations. For their formulation within the framework of linear theory, it is necessary to specify what the base state (or zeroth-order solution) of the flow is. Here, we assume the base state is rest, implying the mean flow velocities are zero.
The bed being impermeable, leads to the kinematic bed boundary-condition:
In case of deep water – by which is meant infinite water depth, from a mathematical point of view – the flow velocities have to go to zero in the limit as the vertical coordinate goes to minus infinity: "z" → -∞.
At the free surface, for infinitesimal waves, the vertical motion of the flow has to be equal to the vertical velocity of the free surface. This leads to the kinematic free-surface boundary-condition:
If the free surface elevation "η"("x","t") was a known function, this would be enough to solve the flow problem. However, the surface elevation is an extra unknown, for which an additional boundary condition is needed. This is provided by Bernoulli's equation for an unsteady potential flow. The pressure above the free surface is assumed to be constant. This constant pressure is taken equal to zero, without loss of generality, since the level of such a constant pressure does not alter the flow. After linearisation, this gives the dynamic free-surface boundary condition:
Because this is a linear theory, in both free-surface boundary conditions – the kinematic and the dynamic one, equations (3) and (4) – the value of "Φ" and ∂"Φ"/∂"z" at the fixed mean level "z" = 0 is used.
Solution for a progressive monochromatic wave.
For a propagating wave of a single frequency – a monochromatic wave – the surface elevation is of the form:
The associated velocity potential, satisfying the Laplace equation (1) in the fluid interior, as well as the kinematic boundary conditions at the free surface (2), and bed (3), is:
with sinh and cosh the hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine function, respectively.
But "η" and "Φ" also have to satisfy the dynamic boundary condition, which results in non-trivial (non-zero) values for the wave amplitude "a" only if the linear dispersion relation is satisfied:
with tanh the hyperbolic tangent. So angular frequency "ω" and wavenumber "k" – or equivalently period "T" and wavelength "λ" – cannot be chosen independently, but are related. This means that wave propagation at a fluid surface is an eigenproblem. When "ω" and "k" satisfy the dispersion relation, the wave amplitude "a" can be chosen freely (but small enough for Airy wave theory to be a valid approximation).
Table of wave quantities.
In the table below, several flow quantities and parameters according to Airy wave theory are given. The given quantities are for a bit more general situation as for the solution given above. Firstly, the waves may propagate in an arbitrary horizontal direction in the x = ("x","y") plane. The wavenumber vector is k, and is perpendicular to the cams of the wave crests. Secondly, allowance is made for a mean flow velocity U, in the horizontal direction and uniform over (independent of) depth "z". This introduces a Doppler shift in the dispersion relations. At an Earth-fixed location, the "observed angular frequency" (or "absolute angular frequency") is "ω". On the other hand, in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity U (so the mean velocity as observed from this reference frame is zero), the angular frequency is different. It is called the "intrinsic angular frequency" (or "relative angular frequency"), denoted as "σ". So in pure wave motion, with U=0, both frequencies "ω" and "σ" are equal. The wave number "k" (and wavelength "λ") are independent of the frame of reference, and have no Doppler shift (for monochromatic waves).
The table only gives the oscillatory parts of flow quantities – velocities, particle excursions and pressure – and not their mean value or drift.
The oscillatory particle excursions ξ"x" and "ξ""z" are the time integrals of the oscillatory flow velocities u"x" and "u""z" respectively. 
Water depth is classified into three regimes: 
In the limiting cases of deep and shallow water, simplifying approximations to the solution can be made. While for intermediate depth, the full formulations have to be used. 
Surface tension effects.
Due to surface tension, the dispersion relation changes to:
with "γ" the surface tension, with SI units in N/m. All above equations for linear waves remain the same, if the gravitational acceleration "g" is replaced by
As a result of surface tension, the waves propagate faster. Surface tension only has influence for short waves, with wavelengths less than a few decimeters in case of a water–air interface. For very short wavelengths – two millimeter in case of the interface between air and water – gravity effects are negligible.
Interfacial waves.
Surface waves are a special case of interfacial waves, on the interface between two fluids of different density. 
Two layers of infinite depth.
Consider two fluids separated by an interface, and without further boundaries. Then their dispersion relation "ω2" = Ω2("k") is given through:
where "ρ" and "ρ‘" are the densities of the two fluids, below ("ρ") and above ("ρ‘") the interface, respectively. Further "γ" is the surface tension on the interface. 
For interfacial waves to exist, the lower layer has to be heavier than the upper one, "ρ" > "ρ‘". Otherwise, the interface is unstable and a Rayleigh–Taylor instability develops.
Two layers between horizontal rigid planes.
For two homogeneous layers of fluids, of mean thickness "h" below the interface and "h′" above – under the action of gravity and bounded above and below by horizontal rigid walls – the dispersion relationship "ω2" = Ω2("k") for gravity waves is provided by:
where again "ρ" and "ρ′" are the densities below and above the interface, while coth is the hyperbolic cotangent function. For the case "ρ′" is zero this reduces to the dispersion relation of surface gravity waves on water of finite depth "h".
Two layers bounded above by a free surface.
In this case the dispersion relation allows for two modes: a barotropic mode where the free surface amplitude is large compared with the amplitude of the interfacial wave, and a baroclinic mode where the opposite is the case – the interfacial wave is higher than and in antiphase with the free surface wave. The dispersion relation for this case is of a more complicated form.
Second-order wave properties.
Several second-order wave properties, "i.e." quadratic in the wave amplitude "a", can be derived directly from Airy wave theory. They are of importance in many practical applications, "e.g." forecasts of wave conditions. Using a WKBJ approximation, second-order wave properties also find their applications in describing waves in case of slowly varying bathymetry, and mean-flow variations of currents and surface elevation. As well as in the description of the wave and mean-flow interactions due to time and space-variations in amplitude, frequency, wavelength and direction of the wave field itself.
Table of second-order wave properties.
In the table below, several second-order wave properties – as well as the dynamical equations they satisfy in case of slowly varying conditions in space and time – are given. More details on these can be found below. The table gives results for wave propagation in one horizontal spatial dimension. Further on in this section, more detailed descriptions and results are given for the general case of propagation in two-dimensional horizontal space. 
The last four equations describe the evolution of slowly varying wave trains over bathymetry in interaction with the mean flow, and can be derived from a variational principle: Whitham's average Lagrangian method. In the mean horizontal-momentum equation, "d"("x") is the still water depth, "i.e." the bed underneath the fluid layer is located at "z" = –"d". Note that the mean-flow velocity in the mass and momentum equations is the "mass transport velocity" formula_18, including the splash-zone effects of the waves on horizontal mass transport, and not the mean Eulerian velocity (e.g. as measured with a fixed flow meter).
Wave energy density.
Wave energy is a quantity of primary interest, since it is a primary quantity that is transported with the wave trains. As can be seen above, many wave quantities like surface elevation and orbital velocity are oscillatory in nature with zero mean (within the framework of linear theory). In water waves, the most used energy measure is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area. It is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy density, integrated over the depth of the fluid layer and averaged over the wave phase. Simplest to derive is the mean potential energy density per unit horizontal area "E"pot of the surface gravity waves, which is the deviation of the potential energy due to the presence of the waves:
with an overbar denoting the mean value (which in the present case of periodic waves can be taken either as a time average or an average over one wavelength in space). 
The mean kinetic energy density per unit horizontal area "E"kin of the wave motion is similarly found to be:
with "σ" the intrinsic frequency, see the table of wave quantities. Using the dispersion relation, the result for surface gravity waves is:
As can be seen, the mean kinetic and potential energy densities are equal. This is a general property of energy densities of progressive linear waves in a conservative system. Adding potential and kinetic contributions, "E"pot and "E"kin, the mean energy density per unit horizontal area "E" of the wave motion is:
In case of surface tension effects not being negligible, their contribution also adds to the potential and kinetic energy densities, giving
with "γ" the surface tension.
Wave action, wave energy flux and radiation stress.
In general, there can be an energy transfer between the wave motion and the mean fluid motion. This means, that the wave energy density is not in all cases a conserved quantity (neglecting dissipative effects), but the total energy density – the sum of the energy density per unit area of the wave motion and the mean flow motion – is. However, there is for slowly varying wave trains, propagating in slowly varying bathymetry and mean-flow fields, a similar and conserved wave quantity, the wave action formula_24
with formula_26 the action flux and formula_27 the group velocity vector. Action conservation forms the basis for many wind wave models and wave turbulence models. It is also the basis of coastal engineering models for the computation of wave shoaling. Expanding the above wave action conservation equation leads to the following evolution equation for the wave energy density:
with:
In this equation in non-conservation form, the Frobenius inner product formula_32 is the source term describing the energy exchange of the wave motion with the mean flow. Only in case the mean shear-rate is zero, formula_33 the mean wave energy density formula_34 is conserved. The two tensors formula_30 and formula_31 are in a Cartesian coordinate system of the form:
with formula_38 and formula_39 the components of the wavenumber vector formula_40 and similarly formula_41 and formula_42 the components in of the mean velocity vector formula_43.
Wave mass flux and wave momentum.
The mean horizontal momentum per unit area formula_44 induced by the wave motion – and also the wave-induced mass flux or mass transport – is:
which is an exact result for periodic progressive water waves, also valid for nonlinear waves. However, its validity strongly depends on the way how wave momentum and mass flux are defined. Stokes already identified two possible definitions of phase velocity for periodic nonlinear waves:
The above relation between wave momentum M and wave energy density "E" is valid within the framework of Stokes' first definition.
However, for waves perpendicular to a coast line or in closed laboratory wave channel, the second definition (S2) is more appropriate. These wave systems have zero mass flux and momentum when using the second definition. In contrast, according to Stokes' first definition (S1), there is a wave-induced mass flux in the wave propagation direction, which has to be balanced by a mean flow U in the opposite direction – called the undertow.
So in general, there are quite some subtleties involved. Therefore also the term pseudo-momentum of the waves is used instead of wave momentum.
Mass and momentum evolution equations.
For slowly varying bathymetry, wave and mean-flow fields, the evolution of the mean flow can de described in terms of the mean mass-transport velocity formula_46 defined as:
Note that for deep water, when the mean depth "h" goes to infinity, the mean Eulerian velocity formula_43 and mean transport velocity formula_46 become equal.
The equation for mass conservation is:
where "h"(x,"t") is the mean water-depth, slowly varying in space and time. 
Similarly, the mean horizontal momentum evolves as:
with "d" the still-water depth (the sea bed is at "z"=–"d"), formula_30 is the wave radiation-stress tensor, formula_53 is the identity matrix and formula_54 is the dyadic product:
Note that mean horizontal momentum is only conserved if the sea bed is horizontal ("i.e." the still-water depth "d" is a constant), in agreement with Noether's theorem.
The system of equations is closed through the description of the waves. Wave energy propagation is described through the wave-action conservation equation (without dissipation and nonlinear wave interactions):
The wave kinematics are described through the wave-crest conservation equation:
with the angular frequency "ω" a function of the (angular) wavenumber k, related through the dispersion relation. For this to be possible, the wave field must be coherent. By taking the curl of the wave-crest conservation, it can be seen that an initially irrotational wavenumber field stays irrotational.
Stokes drift.
When following a single particle in pure wave motion formula_58 according to linear Airy wave theory, a first approximation gives closed elliptical orbits for water particles. However, for nonlinear waves, particles exhibit a Stokes drift for which a second-order expression can be derived from the results of Airy wave theory (see the table above on second-order wave properties). The Stokes drift velocity formula_59, which is the particle drift after one wave cycle divided by the period, can be estimated using the results of linear theory:
so it varies as a function of elevation. The given formula is for Stokes first definition of wave celerity. When formula_61 is integrated over depth, the expression for the mean wave momentum formula_44 is recovered.

Luções

Luções or phonetically Luzones is the name that the Portuguese explorers in Southeast Asia used to refer to one of the ethnic groups that occupied the island of Luzon around the time of the early 16th century.
The Luções people are written in the documents of Fernão Mendes Pinto (1614); Tomé Pires (whose written documents were published in 1944); and Antonio Pigafetta, the Italian scholar who chronicled the journey of Ferdinand Magellan and published it in 1524.
Portuguese-Philippines.
Pires noted that they were "mostly heathen" and were not much esteemed in Malacca at the time he was there, although he also noted that they were strong, industrious, given to useful pursuits. Pires' exploration led him to discover that in their own country, the Luções had "foodstuffs, wax, honey, inferior grade gold," had no king, and were governed instead by a group of elders. They traded with tribes from Borneo and Indonesia and Philippine historians note that the language of the Luções was one of the 80 different languages spoken in Malacca When Magellan's ship arrived in the Philippines and East Timor, Pigafetta noted that there were Luções there collecting sandalwood. 
The Luções' activities weren't limited to trade however. They also had a reputation for being fierce warriors.
Pinto noted that there were a number of them in the Islamic fleets that went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century. The Sultan of Aceh gave one of them the of task of holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540. Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays remaining in the Moluccas Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511. Pigafetta notes that one of them was in command of the Brunei fleet in 1521.
However, the Luções did not only fight on the side of the Muslims. Pinto says they were also apparently among the natives of the Philippines who fought the Muslims in 1538. Scholars have thus suggested that they could be mercenaries valued by all sides.
According to Anthony Reid notes that "the Luções people disappeared from descriptions of the archipelago after the Spanish conquest of Manila in 1571." The island of Luzon still bears their name.

John Raymond Douglas (born 24 October 1951 in Brunswick East) is a former Australian sportsman who played Australian rules football in the Victorian Football League (VFL) with North Melbourne during the 1970s and first-class cricket for Victoria.
From the Coburg Amateurs originally, Douglas made his VFL debut in the opening round of the 1972 season against St Kilda, whose Brownlow Medal rover Ross Smith was celebrating his 200th game. He played six further games that year and didn't appear again until 1975, when North Melbourne won their inaugural premiership with Douglas taking the field three times during the home and away season. He finished his football career after playing just two games in 1976, to finish with 12 games and eight goals for North Melbourne.
A right-arm fast-medium pace bowler, Douglas claimed 30 wickets at 26.53 from his nine first-class matches. The first lot of matches came during the summer of 1975/76, while he was still a North Melbourne player, beginning with a Sheffield Shield encounter against New South Wales. Test player John Dyson was his maiden wicket and he finished his first innings with 4/65.
In early 1976, Douglas toured South Africa with the DH Robins' XI, a team with first-class status who annually toured the country during apartheid. His victims for the tour included Eddie Barlow and Barry Richards.
The rest of his first-class matches were for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield, the most memorable being against South Australia at Adelaide Oval when he took match figures of 11/138. The haul included his best innings figures of 7/71.

Buckeystown Historic District

The Buckeystown Historic District includes the majority of the small town of Buckeystown, Maryland, an unincorporated community located in Frederick County, Maryland, USA. It is named for George Buckey, a tanner, and his brother, John Buckey, a blacksmith and tavern owner. Buckeystown is on the U.S National Register of Historic Places and the Maryland Civil War Trail due to its rich history and beautiful examples of Queen Anne and Victorian style houses, along with a small commercial center. Each historic home has a plaque indicating the year built, the earliest being circa 1780. There are also several historical information plaques installed along the main street.
History.
The land Buckeystown now sits on was once called "Good Luck." It began as a parcel given to Meredith Davis by the King of England in 1731. Over time, more land was added to the original tract. A road that stretched from Pennsylvania to Florida bisected the town and sealed the area's fate: it was the perfect place for enterprising families to settle. The town grew due to the prosperity of several businesses which took advantage of the natural resources the location provided. Two mills were located along the Monocacy River, which runs behind the southside of town, the tannery and an ice creamery utilized a natural spring, and a brickworks used the naturally occurring lime.
Buckeystown enjoyed 100 years of prosperity from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century. Several wealthy families began to dominate the town's social scene. These families built the lavish mansions and proud stone homes which still grace the main streets today. Buckeystown's early industrial center gradually faded, leaving a well-preserved residential district with a particular emphasis on the 1870-1910 period.
The main thoroughfare, currently known as Buckeystown Pike or Maryland State Highway 85, was used during both the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. Soldiers marched through town towards decisive battles, following brave leaders including Stonewall Jackson and General Robert E. Lee.
Present day.
The small community of Buckeystown has several businesses including Hedgeapple Farm, the Buckeystown Market (a pub), The Inn at Buckeystown (a B&B), Bodmers Stoves and Pottery, Maynes Farm, a convenience store and gas station, an antique store, two car clinics, a law firm and a veterinary hospital. Buckeystown Park, by the river on Michael's Mill Road, provides residents with grills, horseshoe pits, picnic shelters and a jungle gym. Four books have been written about Buckeystown history and architecture by resident, Nancy Bodmer. Until recently the town held Victorian House Tours.
Demographics.
The median age for Buckeystown residents is 42.0. There are 39 men and 29 women. Buckeystown is located at 39.334N and -77.431W. Average town elevation is 334 feet.

Jack Bassett

Jack Bassett (11 July 1905 – 19 February 1989) was a Welsh international rugby union full back who played club rugby for Penarth. He won 15 caps for Wales and was selected for the 1930 British Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand. He captained the Welsh team on nine occasions.
Bassett was not the fastest full back, but had a great positional sense on the field which ensured he was always close to the action. He was seen as one of the most devastating tacklers in the game, and many opposing backs would throw the ball into touch rather than allow Bassett to hit them in full flow.
Club career.
Bassett began playing rugby with Kenfig Hill and Pyle before playing a handful of games with Aberavon. He joined the Glamorgan Constabulary in 1924 and found himself stationed in Penarth. From his new town, Bassett played for both the Police XV and Penarth. Although playing for an "unfavourable" club, the Wales full back position became free during the 1928/29 season and the selectors decided to choose the player from the Newport vs Penarth game. Although Newport won the game, Bassett had the better game over Newport's Bill Everson, and was chosen to represent his country.
International career.
Bassett was first capped for Wales against England on January 19, 1929 at Twickenham. Although Wales lost the match Bassett retained his place and played in the remaining three games of the Championship. Bassett played all four games in the 1930 Five Nations Championship, and in the third game against Ireland, Bassett was given the captaincy of Wales for the first time, and also gained his first international points with a drop goal. Bassett had one of his best games against Ireland, with superb defensive play and decisive tackling, saving three tries during the game. The final game of the tournament was a vicious affair against a pugilistic French team, but Bassett missed the match as he had been chosen to tour with the British Lions and was already on his way to Australia.
Bassett had an exceptional tour with the Lions and was acclaimed as the greatest full back in World rugby, even outplaying New Zealand legend George Nepia. Bassett played well for the Lions, earning five caps with clean work in the open, tidying up the British defence to allow good attacking play.
In 1931, Bassett led the Welsh team to their first Championship since 1922, beating France, Ireland and Scotland, and drawing with England at Twickenham. Bassett was also chosen to captain Wales against the 1931 touring South Africans, but when Wales lost he was blamed for not controlling the play from behind the scrummage which saw risky passing and absurd decisions, in a windy and wet match, that the South Africans exploited.
Despite the criticism leveled against him after the South African game, Bassett was selected continue in his captaincy of Wales in the 1932 Championship. Wales beat both England and Scotland, but in the game against Ireland, Bassett had a terrible match which ended his international career. With home advantage and the Triple Crown in sight, Wales were expected to beat the Irish team. Bassett though dropped the ball on his own 25, which Ireland's Edward Lightfoot to score a try. Later in the game Shaun Waide picked up a lucky bounce from an offside position, running 80 yards to score, easily beating Bassett in the process. When Dicky Ralph scored for Wales at the end of the game, Bassett missed the resulting conversion, and ultimately the Triple Crown.

Diarmuid and Grania

Diarmuid and Grania is a play in poetic prose co-written by George Moore and W. B. Yeats in 1901, with incidental music by the English composer Edward Elgar.
Play.
George Moore wrote a novel based on a translation by Lady Gregory of the Fenian tale "The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne". W. B. Yeats then collaborated with Moore in writing the play.
The play, in three acts, was dedicated to Henry Wood, and its first performance was by Frank Benson's English Shakespearean Company at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin on 21 October 1901; it appeared in a double bill, being followed by Douglas Hyde's "Casadh an tSugáin" ("The Twisting of the Hay Rope") performed by Irish-speaking amateurs supplied by the Gaelic League (the first Irish-language play ever seen on a regular stage). The part of Diarmuid was played by Benson, Grania by his wife Constance, and Laban by Lucy Franklein.
Although the collaboration had been difficult – Yeats and Moore disagreed frequently, mainly about style, and there was therefore no final version for publication – the production was well received. There was also controversy because the Irish characters were played by English actors. After the play was produced, Yeats, whose commitment had occasionally seemed to waver, defended it against all criticism.
Music.
At the late stages of composition, the authors decided to add songs, and Edward Elgar provided the music. The music that Elgar wrote for the play forms his Opus 42, which he published under the anglicised title "Grania and Diarmid". It consists of only two pieces: an "Introduction and Funeral March" for orchestra, and a song for contralto soloist "There are seven that pull the thread".
Moore had initially asked Henry Wood if he could write music for the play, but Wood then recommended Elgar to him; though Moore had in any case been considering Elgar for the job. Moore had ambitions for Elgar to write him an opera, but initially asked him to start with the music in the third act, for the death of Diarmuid "..when words can go no further and then I would like music to take up the emotion...". Elgar was enthusiastic, and before even reading the play wrote the lengthy, slow "Funeral March". Later he added the "Introduction" with its mysterious horn calls, and a song in the death scene for the Druidess Laban to sing at her spinning-wheel.
The "Funeral March" received its first separate performance in the Queen's Hall, London on 18 January 1902, conducted by Henry Wood. Its fine quality has been compared to the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, and it is interesting to note that it just preceded the first march.
Recordings.
There are many recordings available of the Funeral March.

Gymnasium Carolinum (Osnabrück)

The Gymnasium Carolinum in Osnabrück, Germany, was founded in 804 by Charlemagne, king of the Franks. It is reputedly the oldest school in Germany and is also one of the oldest surviving schools in the world.
History.
Twentieth Century.
In 1933 the boys' school of the Gymnasium Carolinum had twenty-two teachers, all of whom were Catholics and thirteen of whom had served in the First World War. Only one had up to that point joined the Nazi party. Yet Nazi educational policy changed both the curriculum and the views of students. The number of schools hours devoted to physical exercise, history, and geography increased, while those involving foreign languages and religion decreased. In 1939 essays written by students at the school reflected the new policies and referred frequently to works by Hitler and other Nazi leaders.

Siegfried Bettmann

Siegfried Bettmann was a bicycle, motorcycle and car manufacturer and initiator of the Triumph Motorcycle Company. In 1914 he established the Annie Bettmann Foundation to help young people start businesses Triumph became one of the most famous motorcycle trade-names of the world.
Early life.
Born in 1863 in Nuremberg, Germany, Siegfried Bettmann moved to England in 1885, and settled in Coventry. He found work with Kelly & Co. compiling foreign directories for their publications. After six months, he obtained a job with the White Sewing Machine Co. as a translator and worked as the company's sales representative in northern Europe. Fluent in several languages, he perfected his English, married a local woman, Annie Meyrick (known as Millie) and became a British national.
Business.
Bettmann founded S. Bettmann & Co and started selling bicycles by the name 'Triumph' from premises in London. In 1886, Bettmann sought a more general name, and the company became known as the Triumph Cycle Company. A year later, the company registered as the New Triumph Co. Ltd., with funding from the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company. In that year, Bettmann was joined by another Nuremberg native, an engineer named Moritz (Maurice) Schulte, as a partner. Schulte encouraged Bettmann to transform Triumph into a manufacturing company, and in 1888 Bettmann purchased a site in Coventry using money lent by his and Schulte's families. The company began producing the first Triumph-branded bicycles in 1889. In 1896, Triumph initiated a subsidiary, Orial TWN (Triumph Werke Nuremberg) a German subsidiary for cycle production in his native city. 
In 1902 the company diversified into making motorcycles at their works in Much Park Street. In 1902 the first Triumph motorcycle was developed. It was a strengthened bicycle with a 2.25 bhp Minerva engine. Once the business grew the purchased engines were replaced with their own and in 1907 the company expanded into a new factory in Priory Street, in premises of a former mill.
At the beginning of World War I the War Office called a meeting of Coventry industrialists at St Mary's Hall and asked them to put their resources at the disposal of the military and two weeks after Britain had declared war on Germany, Bettmann received a telephone call from Capt. C. V. Holdsworth of the Army Service Corps, (who later became Triumph's Managing Director) with an order for a hundred Triumph motorcycles for the BEF who were soon to go to France. Despite being a Saturday afternoon, Bettmann and his staff worked non-stop to crate the required motorcycles and by Sunday evening they were delivered to Coventry railway station in time for the evening train. The British Army subsequently placed large orders for the Triumph 550 cc Model H and by 1918 they were Britain's largest motorcycle manufacturer.
In 1921 Bettmann further diversified into car production and bought the Dawson Car Company to produce the Triumph 10/20. In 1927 he developed the Triumph Super 7 which sold well until 1934. In 1930 the company changed its name to the Triumph Motor Company and produced the Triumph Southern Cross and Gloria ranges. In 1936 the company had financial problems however and in 1936 the Triumph bicycle and motorcycle businesses were both sold. The motorcycle business was bought by Jack Sangster of Ariel Motorcycles to become Triumph Engineering Co Ltd.
Later life.
Siegfried Bettmann’s success enabled him to become President of the Coventry Liberal Association. A Freemason and founder member of Coventry’s Chamber of Commerce, he was also a Justice of the Peace and in 1913 became Mayor of Coventry, the first non-British subject to have the position. 
His German origins resulted in him being removed from this position on the beginning of the First World War. 
In 1914 Siegfried Bettmann founded the Annie Bettmann Foundation with his wife to help young Coventry men and women between the ages of eighteen and forty who wished to start a business. Preference was given to ex-servicemen and the fund, which is still in existence, was extended subsequently to include grants for further education. Bettmann also commissioned a memorial for the 66 employees of the Triumph company killed in action during the First World War, built in Coventry's London Road cemetery in 1921.
The Triumph Motorcycle Company became one of the most famous motorcycle marques of the world and Bettmann retained an association with the company until his death. Siegfried Bettmann died on 23 September 1951 at his home "Elm Bank", Stoke Park, Coventry.

Japanese minelayer Itsukushima

Building.
Under the fiscal 1923 budget, the Imperial Japanese Navy authorized a minelayer to supplement its aging minelayers, the former cruisers , and . The new vessel was designed to carrying 500 Type 5 naval mines, and to incorporate design features developed through operational experience gained in World War I. Initial plans to procure a 3000-ton vessel were scaled back to 2000-tons due to budget limitations.
"Itsukushima" was launched by the Uraga Dock Company on May 22, 1929, and was commissioned into service on December 26, 1929.
Operational history.
After commissioning, "Istukushima" was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District as a reserve and training vessel, making occasional cruises to the South Pacific Mandate and Bonin Islands. During the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935, she was attached to the IJN 4th Fleet and suffered damage due to a typhoon in what was termed the "Fourth Fleet Incident". The damage required several months of extensive repairs, resulting in an almost complete rebuild by May 1936. "Istukushima" was assigned to the IJN 3rd Fleet from 20 October 1936, but is reassigned directly to the Combined Fleet after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. After patrols of the Chinese coast until October 1937, "Istukushima" was reassigned back to the IJN 3rd Fleet and stationed at Ryojun Guard District. From December 1937 to 20 March 1938, "Istukushima" was assigned to the IJN 4th Fleet, and then back to Yokosuka Naval District, but based at Sasebo. From August 1938, under the command of the IJN 3nd Fleet, "Istukushima" began patrols of the Yangzi River in China. However, at the end of 1938, she was removed from active duty and placed on reserve status and returned to Yokosuka.
"Istukushima" was reactivated on 15 November 1940 under the Combined Fleet and resumed patrols of the China coast to April 1941, when she was reassigned back to the IJN 3rd Fleet and deployed to Palau in December 1941. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, "Itsukushima" was assigned to the Southern Philippines Striking Force of the IJN 3rd Fleet under the overall command of Admiral Ibō Takahashi, and tasked with mining the San Bernardino Strait.
In January 1942, "Itsukushima" was assigned to the Netherlands East Indies theatre of operations, supporting the Japanese invasions of Tarakan and Balikpapan in Borneo as flagship of the Second Base Unit under Admiral Sueto Hirose. From 10 March, she was reassigned to the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet under Admiral Rokuzo Sugiyama, and continued to support operations in Borneo and Java. She was then reassigned to the Second Southern Expeditionary Fleet, under the Southwest Area Fleet, patrolling between Singapore, Surabaya, Batavia and Ambon to the end of the year. On 25–26 December 1942, together with the light cruiser , "Itsukushima" landed troops of the 24th Naval Base force which captured Hollandia, New Guinea.
"Itsukushima" was subsequently based out of Palau through most of 1943, becoming part of the Fourth Southern Expeditionary Fleet from 30 November, and was deployed to Ambon by the end of the year.
In early 1944, "Itsukushima" was assigned to escort convoys between Ambon, Surabaya and Halmahera Island. On 6 May, she was unsuccessfully attacked by the , in the Celebes Sea. On 31 May, "Itsukushima" was assigned to "Operation KON" (the Relief of Biak), transporting reinforcements from Zamboanga on Mindanao in an effort to counter the American landings. On 24 August, "Itsukushima" was attacked by USAAF B-25 Mitchell bombers from the 345th Bomb Group while escorting a convoy near Lahbeh Strait near the Celebes. A near miss flooded her aft section, and engine room. She was attacked again on 2 September, but shot down two of the attacking planes, and so damaging two others that they were forced to crash-land. On 4 October, the minelayer arrived to take "Itsukushima" under tow for Surabaya. However, on 17 October, while transiting the Java Sea under tow, "Itsukushima" was torpedoed by the Royal Dutch Navy submarine , and sank at position .
"Itsukushima" was removed from the navy list on 10 January 1945.

Storfjorden (Sunnmøre)

Storfjorden or Storfjord is a long fjord in the Sunnmøre region of Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It stretches from the village of Hareid in the west to the villages of Tafjord and Geiranger in the east. The Storfjorden system branches off into several smaller fjords including the famous Geirangerfjord and Tafjorden. At the village of Stranda, the main fjord branches off into the Sunnylvsfjorden-Geirangerfjorden to the west and the Norddalsfjorden-Tafjorden to the east. 
The name literally means the "big" or "great" fjord, indicating that this is a long fjord and it is, in fact, the main fjord in this region. Stretching about , Storfjord is the 5th longest fjord in Norway. The Storfjord is a dominant topographical feature in the Sunnmøre region as it cuts the region in two parts that are only connected by ferry. The deepest point in the fjord is near the village of Dyrkorn in Stordal Municipality.
The landscape around Storfjorden is typical for Western Norway. The mouth the fjord is surrounded by islands with mountains reaching above sea level. Further to the east there are higher mountains. At the villages of Tafjord and Geiranger, the mountains climb to about above sea level. Most of the Storfjorden has characteristically steep or very steep shores, interrupted by several gentle valleys stretching up to into the hinterland. In this way, the Storfjorden system is, along with the Nordfjorden, Sognefjorden, and Hardangerfjorden fjord-systems, the major samples of the typical west coast fjords highly praised by visitors.
On the steep shores of the fjord, there are several historic mountain farms such as Ytste Skotet in Stordal Municipality and Me-Åkernes, Skageflå, and Knivsflå in Stranda Municipality.

Transportation.
Several car ferries cross the fjord, but there are no bridges or tunnels. The proposed Storfjord Bridge may one day cross the fjord, but it is cost prohibitive at this time. Here is a list of the ferry crossings: 
Due to the steep slopes along the shores, road construction is challenging and overland road transport is often limited to valleys. On the northern shore of the Storfjorden, there a continuous network of roads from Tafjord to the island of Sula using the roads 63, 650, E39, 656, 60 and 61. On the southern shore, there are only short sections of roads along the fjord itself.
During summer the Hurtigruten line visits the Storfjorden and Geirangerfjorden regularly.

Fletcher has been informed that Godber is to become his new cellmate. Understandably, Fletcher is not too happy because he had just been given a single cell. Godber explains its not is fault, because there was a riot on his block, and his cellmate Banksy set fire to his own bed as well as Godber's. Godber soon finds out that Fletcher has rather strict rules about his cell.
After lock-up that night, Godber soon tells Fletcher that he is depressed and is finding prison life hard to adjust to. Fletcher tells Godber the best way to think of it, is to see it as just a "quiet night in". The trouble is that Godber has 698 to go.
During the night, Fletcher tells Godber about his daughter Ingrid being conceived on the tomb of Karl Marx. Also, Fletcher says how his three children were born five years apart because he kept going away for five years. Fletcher advises Godber not to have any carnal thoughts about women, because this would only depress him. Before he goes to sleep, Godber prays out loud much to Fletcher's chagrin.
The next morning, the cells are opened again for the day. Godber swaps his Liquorice allsorts for a squeeze of Fletcher's special toothpaste. Godber thanks Fletcher for helping me to get through the night. Fletcher replies that they could have another quiet night in that evening. The episode ends with the prisoners going out onto the landing to start their day.

Fantastic Voyage (Coolio song)

"Fantastic Voyage" is a song by American rapper Coolio. It was released in March 1994 as the third single from his debut album "It Takes a Thief". The song later featured on the album "". The song samples "Fantastic Voyage" by Lakeside.
Content.
According to Allmusic's Jason Lymangrover, "With its infectious "Slide, slide, slippity slide" chorus, it went unnoticed that his breakthrough single, "Fantastic Voyage," was actually a song about escapism."
Music video.
The music video features Coolio napping on his front porch, when he gets a phone call from his friend Spoon that wakes him. Spoon asks about taking a trip to the beach, to which an annoyed Coolio responds "we ain't got no car" and hangs up on him. Suddenly a mysterious man with a 70's style suit, afro, and cane appears and turns the bicycle sitting upside down on his Coolio's driveway into a convertible car. Now with a means of transportation, Coolio and his crew head to the beach. The rest of the video features Coolio at the beach helping the crowd of passengers out of the trunk of the car for a beach party, which includes people of all races and a mariachi band. At the end of the video, the car is transformed back into a bicycle on Coolio's driveway, and Coolio is woken again by a phone call from Spoon, showing that the trip was all a dream. Coolio reminds him that they don't have a car, tells him to quit calling, and hangs up. Then Coolio looks at the bike to see the car's license plate hanging off of the bike. Leaving him wondering if the events were really a dream and setting the events for the video "I Remember".

Gus Healy

Augustine A. "Gus" Healy (20 May 1904 – 10 July 1987) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. A dental laboratory proprietor, Healy was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork Borough constituency at the 1957 general election but lost his seat at the 1961 general election, and was instead nominated by the Taoiseach Seán Lemass to the 10th Seanad. Healy regained his Dáil seat at the 1965 general election and, later representing Cork City South–East, retained his seat until retiring at the 1977 general election. 
Healy also served as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1964–65 and 1975–76.
Healy was a keen amateur swimmer and a member of Sunday's Well Swimming Club. He continued to promote the sport during his mayoralty and in the 1970s the city's first suburban swimming pool at Douglas was named the Gus Healy municipal swimming pool.

Medical Practitioners' Union

The Medical Practitioners' Union is a section of Unite the Union, a trade union in the United Kingdom.
The union was founded as the Medico-Political Union in 1914 and was renamed the Medical Practitioners' Union in 1922. It amalgamated with the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs in 1970 under the leadership of Hugh Faulkner. It remained a distinct section through a series of mergers which formed Manufacturing, Science and Finance, Amicus and ultimately Unite.
The union published "Medical World". This originated in 1913 as the official journal of the State
Medical Service Association, but was adopted as the official union journal the following year. The union opposed the British Medical Association. It aimed to extend the provision of medical care by the state, while retaining the independence of general practitioners.

Chínipas de Almada is a town in the south-western portion of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, in the Sierra Madre Occidental. It serves as the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of Chínipas. 
The name honours Francisco R. Almada, a historian and two-time governor of Chihuahua born in the town; the "de Almada" suffix was added by the State Congress on 17 June 1976, when Chínipas served as the state capital for one day.
In the 2005 INEGI Census, the reported a total population of 1,398. 
Chínipas was founded as a mission town by the Jesuits Pedro Juan Castini and Julio Pascual on 31 December 1626. They were both killed, and the mission destroyed, during a Native war against the Spaniards, specifically on 1 February 1632. The mission was rebuilt, slightly down-stream, in 1676. 
Gold was found locally in 1798, which led to the towns rapid expansion with European settlers in the late 19th century. Well known local family names include Piero, Sarracino the Santinis from Italy, Balderrama from Spain, the Schultzes from Germany, the Russos from Sicily, the O'Leary's from Ireland (now spelled Alire), the Bridge's from England (now spelled Breach) and the Willis' from England (now spelled Villis). The largest mine was called the Palmarejo and was British owned. The equipment was manufactured in England, shipped to Guaymas on the Sonora coast, transported by mule or donkey to San Bernardo, Sonora and then by over the mountain on peoples backs.

List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Cyprus

The High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Cyprus is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of Cyprus.
Previously a territory of the Ottoman Empire, a British protectorate under Ottoman suzerainty was established over Cyprus by the Cyprus Convention of 4 June 1878. The United Kingdom declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November 1914 and annexed Cyprus. Turkey recognised British possession of Cyprus by the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923 and the island became a Crown Colony on 10 March 1925. Following the Zürich and London Agreement of 19 February 1959, Cyprus became independent on 16 August 1960. The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the British Commonwealth, so the British diplomatic representative is a High Commissioner.

The Fixations

The Fixations were a mod revival band from North London that formed in 1978. An early incarnation of the band, including Ken Gamby (drums), Paul Cathcart (vocals, lead guitar), Paul Cattini (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Noel Hughes (bass) started in summer 1976. The line-up changed in 1978 with Richard Sharp joining the band on rhythm guitar. Later Cathcart switched to lead guitar and taught Richard bass guitar, and gigs were lined up by November 1978, making them one of the first bands in the mod revival scene, and gaining a very early mention in "Sounds".
They played at venues such as Dingwalls, The Marquee Club, Club 100, The Music Machine and Pied Bull, where they held a residency. They toured all over England with The Chords, Teenbeats, Purple Hearts, The Scooters, The Killermeters and other mod revivalists. Unlike many of the mod revival bands, they did not play any cover versions. Lyrically, they tackled a range of subjects, and a number of their songs covered attitudes to the work environment.
Their management turned down a number of record deals, so no vinyl records exist by this band, despite recording a double A side ("No Way Out"/"Clever Remarks") with Larry Wallace for Carerre. Detour Records has released "The Sound Of Young London", and a book has been written by their drummer called "The Fixations Modest Recognition". Written by Ken Gamby and Paul Cattini, the book chronicles the history of the band.

Shrouded tidal turbine

[[Image:Tidalenergyturbine.jpg|thumb|The shrouded turbine Race Rocks Tidal Current Generator before installation at Race Rocks in southern British Columbia in 2006. It operates bi-directionally and has proven to be efficient in contributing to the integrated power system of the area.
The shrouded tidal turbine is an emerging tidal stream technology that has a turbine enclosed in a venturi shaped shroud or duct (ventuduct), producing a sub atmosphere of low pressure behind the turbine. The venturi shrouded turbine is not subject to the Betz limit and allows the turbine to operate at higher efficiencies than the turbine alone by increasing the volume of the flow over the turbine. Claimed improvements vary, from 1.15 to 4 times higher power output than the same turbine minus the shroud. The Betz limit of 59.3% conversion efficiency for a turbine in an open flow still applies, but is applied to the much larger shroud cross-section rather than the small turbine cross-section.
Principles.
Considerable commercial interest has been shown in shrouded tidal stream turbines due to the increased power output. They can operate in shallower slower moving water with a smaller turbine at sites where large turbines are restricted. Arrayed across a seaway or in fast flowing rivers, shrouded turbines are cabled to shore for connection to a grid or a community. Alternatively the property of the shroud that produces an accelerated flow velocity across the turbine allows tidal flows formerly too slow for commercial use to be used for energy production.
While the shroud may not be practical in wind, as the next generation of tidal stream turbine design it is gaining more popularity and commercial use. The Tidal Energy Pty Ltd tidal turbine is multidirectional able to face up-stream in any direction and the Lunar Energy turbine bi directional. All tidal stream turbines constantly need to face at the correct angle to the water stream in order to operate. The Tidal Energy Pty Ltd is a unique case with a pivoting base. Lunar Energy use a wide angle diffuser to capture incoming flow that may not be inline with the long axis of the turbine. A shroud can also be built into a tidal fence or barrage increasing the performance of turbines.
Types of shroud.
Not all shrouded turbines are the same - the performance of a shrouded turbine varies with the design of the shroud. Not all shrouded turbines have undergone independent scrutiny of claimed performances, as companies closely guard their respective technologies, so quoted performance figures need to be closely scrutinised. Lunar Energy reports a 15%-25% improvement over the same turbine without the shroud. Shrouded turbines do not operate at maximum efficiency when the shroud does not intercept the current flow at the correct angle, which can occur as currents eddy and swirl, resulting in reduced operational efficiency. At lower turbine efficiencies the extra cost of the shroud must be justified, while at higher efficiencies the extra cost of the shroud has less impact on commercial returns. Similarly the added cost of the supporting structure for the shroud has to be balanced against the performance gained. Yawing (pivoting) the shroud and turbine at the correct angle, so it always faces upstream like a wind sock, can increase turbine performance but may need expensive active devices to turn the shroud into the flow. Passive designs can be incorporated, such as floating the shrouded turbine under a pontoon on a swing mooring, or flying the turbine like a kite under water. One design yaws the shrouded turbine using a turntable.

Jur Hronec

Jur Hronec (May 17, 1881 – December 1, 1959) was an important Slovak mathematician.
Early Years.
Jur Hronec was born in Gočovo, Slovakia. He grew up in modest circumstances in a farmers family. After graduating from high school in Rožňava he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Cluj under supervision of Professor Ludovit Schlesinger.From 1908 to 1914 he studied at Göttingen, Giessen, Berlin, Switzerland and Paris, in the years 1922-1923 in Prague, Göttingen and Giessen. Doctoral dissertation in the field of differential equations he defended in 1912 in Giessen.
Career.
In years 1906-1922, after successful completion of the university, he worked in years with fewer interruptions while on study abroad at school in Kezmarok.
Jur Hronec was habilitated at Charles University in Prague in 1923. From 1924 to 1939 he was professor of mathematics at the Czech Technical University in Brno. Educational work of the school determined his further scientific focus. He recognized the importance of mathematics in science and technology and focused his research on application to technical problems. Lifetime Achievement Hronca academic includes three areas: scientific, educational, public. Research activities focused primarily on differential equations. He studied problems of Erdős–Fuchs theorem of linear differential equations and their generalization.
He wrote a considerable number of scientific papers, publications, and university textbooks, the most important are:
He lectured at many national and international conferences and symposia. Throughout his scientific and pedagogical career he has been in contact with mathematicians abroad, and collaborated very actively with Czech mathematicians. J. Hronec Stressed the importance of teacher's personality in the pedagogical work:
Hronec has significant merit in the creation and development of science and technical universities in Slovakia. In the spring of 1936 Jur Hronec was the initiator of "Action for the construction of Slovak universities", where he was elected President at its founding meeting. In autumn 1936 he was the chairman of the Action Committee for the construction of technical university in Slovakia. This activity has been successful - in June 1937 the National Assembly adopted the Law on the establishment of technical university in Kosice. August 4, 1938 Jur Hronec was fourthelected its first Rector. In 1940 he participated in the establishment of the Slovak University of Natural Sciences and College of Commerce in Bratislava, where he became its first Dean. In 1946 he was the chairman of the Commission for the establishment of the University of Agriculture and Forestry in Kosice. In the same year, laying the foundation in Bratislava, Faculty of Education (Dean 1946 - 1948).
J. Hrones devoted a great care to the mathematics department of Comenius University in Bratislava, where he was head of department for many years. 
Other posts and achievements:
He paid great attention to the high school youth. On his initiative and in collaboration with several mathematicians in Slovakia there were various math competition organized for high school students, which from 1951 were working within the framework of mathematical olympiad. J. Hronec had warm relations since the beginning with the union of mathematicians and physicists. He was the first Slovak Mathematicians, who corresponded with the Union of Czech Mathematicians and in 1921 became a member. He laid the foundations of action of the union in Slovakia. When in 1956 the Slovak Committee was created, he was elected as its chairman. J. Hronec has great merits in the development of a high level of mathematics in Slovakia, where he mentored nearly two generations of Slovak Mathematicians.
He died first December 1959 in Bratislava. He is buried in his native village of Gočove.
Awards.
His scientific, educational and organizational work has been acknowledged by several national and scientific awards. Union of Czechoslovak Mathematicians and Physicists in 1959 awarded him the title of "honorary member". It was the first time this title was awarded to their members. In 1962 he was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Comenius. In 1971 was opened a room to the public in his home Gočove. In 1981 a plaque was unveiled on the building of the pavilion of Mathematics Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics Comenius University in Bratislava, with the inscription "Jur Hronec, Slovak Mathematician, Educator and Humanitarian (1881-1959)".
There are several educational institutions named after him in Slovakia. A well-respected gymnasium in Bratislava was named in his honour. At the Slovak University of Technology a halls of residence is named after him as well an Elementary School in Rožňava.

A distinguished and one of the most-decorated officer in the Pakistan Armed Forces, his appointment was approved by President Asif Ali Zardari on 5 October 2008 upon the retirement of Admiral Afzal Tahir. His appointment was recommended by the Defence Minister Ahmad Mukhtar after his and the then Chief of Staff (COS) Vice-Admiral Asaf Humayun's names were sent to the President. As Humayun was senior to Bashir, the former was superseded. Later however, Vice Admiral Asaf Humayun was appointed as the Vice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS) on 31 October 2008.

In it he defended his claims that the "Taliban are inward rather than outward looking" and "they have also signalled readiness to engage constructively with the international community." Moreover, he says that "keeping Afghanistan broken and destabilized suits those who do not want the Caspian/Central Asian oil and gas pipelines to take one of the shortest and economical outlets over Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Arabian Sea."
Navy career.
Bashir served in the Naval aviation and is a career naval aviator, having commanded the two combat navy's aviation squadrons. His combat assignment including the command of the two combat ships; a frigate and a corvette.

His last three-star appointment was the senior fleet commander of Karachi contingent as commander Karachi (COMKAR), from where he was elevated to the post of Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) on 5 October 2008. In the race of four-star admiral promotion, Vice-Admiral Asaf Humayun and Vice-Admiral Noman Bashir's names were forwarded to the President Asif Zardari.
Admiral Humayun was senior to Admiral Bashir, however, Defence Minister Ahmed Mukhtar recommended the name of Bashir to be elevated to the four-star rank. Admiral Asaf Humayun was superseded. After Admiral Bashir became chief of naval staff, Vice Admiral Asaf Humayun was appointed as the Vice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS) on 31 October 2008.
After assuming the command, Admiral Bashir thanked the president for the appointment and recognized the role of Navy facing the multiple challenges in the realm of maritime security due to the presence of various powers in Pakistan's area of interest. Talking to the media, Bashir vowed that Navy to rise to the occasion to safeguard the national interests at any cost.
2008 India-Pakistan standoff.
Only a month of assuming the command of the navy in October 2008, Bashir faced the major crises with neighboring India after the deadly attacks were perpetuated in Mumbai on November 2008. Bashir high-alerted the navy and deployed the combantant assets of the navy to protect the naval vicinity of Sindh and Balochistan Province. Initially, Bashir denied that the terrorists who attacked the city had not used the sea route from Pakistan to reach the city. In a pressing briefing at the ISPR, Bashir maintained that: "We have no evidence whatsoever that had gone to India from Pakistani territorial waters. The Indian Navy is much larger than ours, and if Ajmal Kasab had gone from here, then what were their Coast Guards doing, and why did they did not stop the terrorists." His statement was widely criticized by Indian government and Indian Defence Minister A. K. Antony strongly rebutted his statement.
However after a day of releasing his statement, Bashir retraced his statement and reiterated that "whatever evidence have is correct." Bashir strongly criticized Indian army chief General Deepak Kapoor's statement about simultaneous war with China and Pakistan. Talking to the "AAJ TV", Admiral Bashir quoted that :"Indian generals are well aware of our strength." He maintained to the television correspondents that he does not take Indian army chief General Deepak Kapoor's statement seriously as he "knows about the strength of his neighboring countries, Pakistan and China."
In 2008, in an interview to a "Daily Pakistan", the Admiral Noman Bashir, had told his interviewer that "Pakistan was quite capable of building a nuclear submarine and would do so "if required". Pakistan is a "recognized nuclear power" and if the government made a decision, the nation would develop a naval variant nuclear weapon. During this time, he began pushed and lobbied for building the nuclear submarine and finally, on February 2012, the government gave green signals and authorised the development of the nation's first nuclear submarine after releasing the funds. In 2010, Bashir noted that "the Indian Navy wants to increase military might in the region."
War on Terror.
Admiral Noman Bashir was the chief of naval staff at the breach of the insurgency in the country and diversified the role of navy's capabilities to conduct difficult ground operations against the terrorism. He commanded and coordinated the navy-army operations in north-western contingent of the country and expanded the role of navy on wide range of its operational capacity. Major deployments of navy was made under Admiral Bashir in all over the country to curbed the terrorism. Admiral Bashir earned public notability and public appraise after successfully executing the cross-border operation to evacuated the Pakistani nationals from Somalia. This cross border operation was conducted by Navy alone; and Admiral Bashir personally supervised the execution of the operation.
Admiral Bashir was widely criticized by media for not properly protecting the naval base from being attacked by group of terrorists. However, Admiral Bashir rejected the accusations of security breach on media. On 20 June 2011, Bashir submitted the report over the course of action to the Prime minister and briefed the Prime minister about the security arrangements which had been put in place following the attack on the naval base. During the last days of his terms, Bashir supervised and personally gave commissioned of navy's first UAV squadron in Karachi.
Retirement.
Upon his retirement in 2011, Admiral Bashir was considered to be on the "short list" of choices for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee; the eventual pick was Army General Khalid Shameem Wynne.
Earlier, the Pakistan government had sent the proposal to appoint General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani as the additional office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, but instead Kayani received the extension. However, the Pakistani media then reported since Admiral Bashir is the most senior officer, Admiral Bashir would likely to become the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.
In the line of promotion, General Khalid Shameem Wynne was the most-general in the Pakistan Army, as his chances to became Chief of Army Staff was diminished. On the advice of General Kayani, General Khalid Shameem Wynne was promoted to four-star rank and assumed the Chairmanship of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.

The High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Fiji is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of Fiji.
Fiji gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and Fiji conduct their diplomatic relations at governmental level, rather than between Heads of State. Therefore the countries exchange High Commissioners, rather than ambassadors.
The British High Commissioner to Fiji (or, from 1988 to 1997, the British Ambassador to Fiji) has also acted at various times as High Commissioner to the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Nauru, the Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu and the Republic of Vanuatu.

United Jewish Socialist Workers Party

United Jewish Socialist Workers Party (, "fareynikte yidishe sotsialistishe arbeter-partey") was a political party in Poland and Ukraine. Members of the party along with the Poalei Zion participated in the government of Ukraine and condemned the October Revolution in Petrograd proposing a peaceful resolution of political changes in Russia.
Its followers were generally known simply for the first portion of the name Fareynikte (פֿאַראײניקטע) - 'United'. Politically the party favored national personal autonomy for the Jewish community. The party upheld the ideas of building a secular Jewish community.
Fareynikte was founded in June 1917 through the merger of two groups, the Zionist Socialist Workers Party (SSRP) (Socialist-Territorialists) and the Jewish Socialist Workers Party (SERP). SERP's ideology was based particularly upon "autonomism". Note that some of the leaders from those two parties did not join Fareynikte, but rather became "Folkists" (Folkspartei). Both SSRP and SERP had emerged from the Vozrozhdenie group. As of early 1918, "Fareynikte" was the largest Jewish autonomist political party in the independent Ukraine.
The Faraynikte's program claimed "unity of the Jewish worker's class as an integral part of the 'extraterritorial' Jewish nation and international proletariat". The previous arguments in regard to the way of implementing the territorialists program have been declared as less important. The focal point of the party program a "national-individual autonomy". For a brief period the party acquired a major influence, particularly in Ukraine where it played an important role in an attempt to organize the Jewish national autonomy. In September 1917 Fareynikte petitioned to the Provisional Government to declare the equality of language.
In the 1917 elections in Russia, the party obtained around 8% of the Jewish votes.
"Fareynikt" Moishe Zilberfarb was Deputy-Secretary of Jewish Affairs in the General Secretariat of Ukraine, the main executive institution of the Ukrainian People's Republic from June 28, 1917 to January 22, 1918.
"Fareynikte" ran some Yiddish newspapers in Ukraine. It published the "Naye tsayt" (New Time) in Kiev September 1917-May 1919. Prior to the publishing of "Naye tsayt", the party published "Der yidisher proletarier" from Kiev.
In Poland, dissidents from the "Fareynikte" party joined the Communist Party of Poland.

Earthquake Commission

The Earthquake Commission (EQC) provides primary natural disaster insurance to the owners of residential properties in New Zealand. The Government-owned Crown entity at one point managed assets of $5.93 billion NZD, but its funds are now being drained by payouts for the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes. In addition to its insurance role, EQC also undertakes research and provides training and information on disaster recovery.
History.
EQC was established in 1945 as the Earthquake and War Damage Commission, as part of the New Zealand Government, and was originally intended to provide coverage for earthquakes as well as war damage.
Coverage was eventually extended from solely earthquake and war damage to include other natural disasters such as natural landslips, volcanic eruptions, hydrothermal activity, and tsunamis with coverage for war damage later being removed. For residential land, storm and flood damage is covered. Cover extends over fire damage caused by any of these natural disasters.
Who pays.
The cover is provided at the time the premium is paid to a commercial insurer. A disaster insurance premium is charged to the policyholder, up to a maximum of $207 NZD, which provides the holder with EQC's EQCover. This premium is placed into the Natural Disaster Fund.
EQCover entitles the holder to up to $100,000 NZD plus tax (GST) for each dwelling, with any further amount above that being paid by the policyholder's insurance company. For personal effects, EQC pays out the first $20,000 NZD plus tax. The EQC covers only domestic assets and does not provide cover for businesses.
The EQC levies policyholders to cover a major part of the earthquake risk. The EQC reduces its own risk by taking out cover with a number of large reinsurance companies, for example Munich Re. In 2006, the EQC took out reinsurance of $2.5 billion NZD with multiple reinsurance companies, numbering around 30.
There is a $1.5 billion NZD excess for each earthquake event. If the required EQC payout exceeds the total of the excess and reinsurance ($4 billion NZD) the remainder of the payout is met by the EQC up to the limit of the Natural Disaster Fund. If the payout exceeds those assets, a Crown Guarantee requires that the Government pay the remainder.
Claims.
The EQC paid out for claims made as a result of the 2007 Gisborne earthquake.
For the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, total EQC insurance and individual costs were expected to reach as high as NZ$4 billion according to the New Zealand Treasury. Claims from the 2010 shock were later confirmed at being between $2.75 and $3.5 billion NZD.
A second quake hit Christchurch, the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Prior to the 2010 quake, the EQC had a fund of NZ$5.9 billion, with NZ$4.4 billion left prior to the 2011 quake, after taking off the NZ$1.5 billion cost. The EQC does not cover commercial buildings, whose owners have to arrange cover with private insurers.
As of April 2012 the EQC has paid out NZ$3 billion in claims for both earthquakes, and expects to pay a further $9 billion, which will completely deplete their funds and may require a further NZ$1 billion from the government.
In March 2013, EQC came under fire after an employee accidentally sent a file containing details on more than 80,000 claims relating to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake to a contractor. The file was posted online in April, after EQC declined a "televised debate" on its contents.
Claims affecting reinsurance costs.
After the 2010 Canterbury quake, it was expected that New Zealand insurers would face rate increases of more than 10% for the renewal of their insurance during 2011. Estimates from the world's largest reinsurer Munich Re put the claim bill faced by the reinsurers from the 2010 Canterbury earthquake at US$600 million, nearly US$200 million higher than initial estimates. This does not include the EQC exposure of NZ$1.5 billion.
Munich Re board member Dr Ludger Arnoldussen, who was in New Zealand to speak with insurers, praised the efforts of those companies which handled the claims and the stringent building standards that were in place in New Zealand. Arnoldussen said the expected hike in rates was also likely to translate to higher premiums for policy holders, the extent of which would depend on how much risk the individual companies were prepared to carry. Meanwhile figures show the number of catastrophic events in New Zealand quadrupled in the 30 years to 2010, and that 90% of all insured claims during that period were the result of geophysical events. However rates would remain well below those in California, with policy holders there on average paying about 15 times more than in New Zealand, he said.

Dan Bogan

Dan Bogan (1860 - after 1889) was an American gunfighter and outlaw of the American Old West, who today is considered to have been one of the most underrated gunmen of the 19th century west. He is included as one of twelve described in such a way, in the book ""Deadly Dozen"", by author Robert K. DeArment.
Early life.
Bogan was born in Alabama in 1860. His family moved to Hamilton County, Texas while Bogan was still only a boy, and Bogan began working as a cowboy as soon as his age would allow. After moving to Texas, his father died, and his mother would remarry and divorce twice, by the time Bogan was in his late teens. His two older brothers became involved in activities involving horse theft, resulting in one being shot and killed by the Hamilton County Sheriff, and the other receiving a prison term.
Bogan, thus far, had avoided criminal acts, but at the same time he was prone to fight, and often it seemed to many that he wished to do so. On May 2, 1881, while he and friend Dave Kemp were making their way around Hamilton's saloons drinking heavily, Bogan, while intoxicated, began taunting the patrons of the saloons, daring any who desired to take him on in a fight. Kemp began urging his friend to leave, and led him to where their horses were tied behind the "W. T. Cropper General Store".
Before they reached their horses, Bogan came across local farmer F. A. "Doll" Smith, who was seated on his wagon who was in town to buy supplies. Bogan began to verbally taunt Smith, calling him names and daring him to step down and stop him. Smith, who did not know Kemp or Bogan, at first ignored him. However, when Bogan dragged a chair out of Smith's wagon and began beating it on the ground, Smith began to become more agitated. Bogan then replaced the chair, and again turned his taunts toward Smith. Smith had already made the statement that "I do not whip dogs, otherwise I'd step down and whip you".
By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts for no apparent reason began to wear on Smith, who eventually climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told him that if he pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith in the back of the head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.
Outlaw life.
Bogan left Hamilton not long afterward, settling into working on ranches in and around the Texas Panhandle. In 1884, Bogan was a ring leader in a cowboy's strike for better wages, which ended in all who took part being blacklisted, finding themselves unable to work in the Panhandle. Bogan rode to Wilbarger County, Texas, and joined up for a cattle drive as a drover, working for the "Worsham R-2 Ranch". Cowboy T. J Burkett, also working on that drive, would years later comment that Bogan was a valuable hand to have, and that one night during a fierce thunderstorm, Bogan alone was able to hold 600 head of cattle from breaking into stampede. When the drive reached Dodge City, Kansas, and the cowboys were paid, they commenced to drink and party. Believing they were getting out of hand, Town Marshal Jack Bridges and his deputies confronted them and ran them out of town. This resulted in a brief gunfight between the lawmen and the cowboys, during which cowboy John Briley was shot and killed. Bogan and Burkett were both involved in that escapade, and the cowboys took no action in retaliation.
After returning to the Panhandle, Bogan learned that things had gotten worse for the blacklisted cowboys. He joined up with cowboy Tom Harris, who had organised what was called the "Get Even Cattle Company", which was taking to the practice of placing their own brand on already branded calves owned by the ranchers. Bogan was by this time going by the name Bill Gatlin, and he registered two brands in his own name. The ranchers and county officials commissioned former Lincoln County, New Mexico sheriff Pat Garrett to stop the cowboys, and in doing so it was insinuated he either "should" or "could" kill the main ring leaders, which included Bogan.
At one point, Garrett and his followers rounded up 30 head of cattle bearing Bogan's brand, stating they were stolen, whereas Bogan claimed they were mavericks. Bogan approached lawyer H. H. Wallace, who demanded that Oldham County, Texas officials pay $25,000 in damages, and fearing Bogan might have a case, the county settled for $800. By the fall of that year, indictments had been handed down against 159 cowboys, Bogan being one, and Garrett and his men set out to round them up. Garrett, however, did not disguise his movements, as he did want to avoid trouble if possible and would be satisfied if the cowboys merely left.
In February, 1885, Garrett and Oldham County Sheriff Jim East learned that three of the holdouts, those who refused to leave the Panhandle, were hiding out at the "Howry Cattle Company" headquarters. Riding all night through a snowstorm, they reached the house in which the cowboys were believed to be located. Cowboy Bob Bassett was outside the house gathering firewood, and spotted the posse, alerting the others. Tom Harris then yelled out to Garrett as to what his business was, to which Garrett announced he had warrants for Woods, Bogan and Thompson, but had no issues with anyone else. Nine cowboys then filed from the house, leaving only Thompson and Bogan inside. Woods was not present. Bogan and Woods, however, refused to surrender, and a shootout erupted, during which Bogan was able to make his escape, while Woods was killed. Three posse members were wounded during the exchange.
By 1886, Bogan was in Wyoming working for the "Vorhees Ranch", near Lusk, Wyoming. He is known to have killed three men by this time. Bill Calkin, the editor of the local newspaper, wrote that Bogan was possible a cowboy wanted in Texas, and who had gone by at least two other names in the past. Bogan was infuriated, and Bogan set out looking for him, accompanied by cowboy Sterling Balou. The two entered the "Cleveland Brothers Saloon", at which point Bogan drew his pistol calling for Calkin, and daring any of his friends to challenge him. One of the Cleveland brothers was able to bring a sawed off shotgun to bear on the two cowboys, and seconds later Constable Charles S. Gunn entered with his own pistol drawn, backing Cleveland. Bogan and Balou retreated and fled.
A few days later, while Gunn was out of town, Bogan again went on a rampage. When Gunn returned, and learned of this, he went looking for Bogan, and warned him that if this happened again, he would arrest Bogan. To this, Bogan replied that he would do as he pleased. Constable Gunn had a reputation, which he had shown on several occasions, as a man who would not back down nor be intimidated, and was known to have killed two men while holding that office. Gunn was a former Texas Ranger, who'd made his way up to Wyoming from Texas. Bogan hated Gunn, who had reprimanded him on several occasions by this point. However, by later witness accounts, Bogan feared Gunn, which probably led to what happened next.
Murder of Gunn, jail escape.
On January 14, 1887, Bogan again was causing a disturbance, this time in a dance hall. Gunn entered, yet again to stop him. Bogan, as he had on many occasions prior, backed down when confronted by Gunn. However, evidently Bogan was beginning to tire of the embarrassment of having been slighted so many times by Gunn. The following morning, January 15, 1887, Bogan was waiting inside the "Jim Waters Saloon" for Gunn to make his usual rounds. When Gunn entered, Bogan stated to him, "Charlie, are you heeled", meaning was he armed. Gunn replied that he was always armed.
Bogan was hiding his revolver, already unholstered, behind his back. Upon Gunn's response, he quickly whipped his gun around and shot Gunn in the stomach. As Gunn fell face down to the floor, Gunn pulled his own pistol, but before he could bring it up Bogan ran over and shot him point blank in the head, killing him. Bogan was so close when he fired this second shot, that the muzzle flash caught Gunn's hair on fire. Bogan brandished his pistol at the shocked patrons, and ran out, mounting a horse belonging to Jack Andrews. However, Deputy Marshal John Owens was quick to respond, and blocked Bogan's only exit from town. Owens fired one blast into the air as a warning, and when Bogan continued riding forward, Owens shot him in the shoulder, knocking Bogan from his saddle and into the street.
Bogan was placed in the back room of a local saloon, as there was no jail at the time, but before his shotgun wound had healed, the next day in fact, he took advantage of the poor security and made an escape during a roaring blizzard. Owens, knowing that Bogan was badly wounded, believed he could not go far. He was right, as two weeks later Bogan, burning up with fever and with his wound infected, sent word to Owens that he wished to surrender and receive medical attention. Bogan met with Owens sixteen miles outside of Lusk, and voiced to Owens that he feared a lynch mob would be waiting for him when they reached Lusk, as Gunn was extremely well liked and respected in the town. As they entered town, Owens backed down a mob that was intent on hanging Bogan, then Owens shackled Bogan in the back of the "Sweeney Saloon". The next day, Owens left with Bogan en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by February 4 he had him secured in the Laramie County jail.
On September 7, 1887, Bogan was convicted of murder, and sentenced to death. However, Bogan still had several friends in cowboy circles, namely Tom Hall, whom famed Old West detective Charlie Siringo would later identify as having actually been Tom Nicholls, a murderer from the Texas Panhandle. Hall paid professional safecracker James Jones to commit a minor crime in Cheyenne, and to allow himself to be captured, thus being placed in jail with Bogan. Concealed in his shoes Jones had saw blades, which he and Bogan used to saw through the bars and make an escape on October 4, 1887. Joined by fellow prisoners Charles H. LeRoy and Bill Steary, both horse thieves, they made their escape through a ventilator and onto the roof. Within hours a posse was organised in one of the largest manhunts in Wyoming history.
Laramie County Sheriff Seth Sharpless led the posses, which separated into groups of fifty men each. In addition to this, a $1,000 reward was placed on Bogan, dead or alive. When the manhunt did not produce Bogan, Siringo, acting on information he had received from sources, went undercover and was able to gain the confidence of Hall and his cohorts. Bogan, however, was no longer riding with them, and had made his way toward Utah. Siringo was able to produce evidence for indictments against Hall and several others for their having assisted Bogan, resulting in their arrests.
Disappearance and rumors.
Siringo continued to pursue Bogan, a trek which led him into Utah, then to New Mexico Territory, where he came into contact with Lem Woodruff, an old Panhandle friend to Bogan. According to Woodruff, Bogan was last known to be heading for New Orleans, Louisiana, intending on taking a ships passage to South America, stating he was tired of living on the run. The last he was heard of, Bogan sent a letter addressed to Tom Hall in Cheyenne, from New Orleans, indicating he was heading to Argentina.
Anything after that was mere hearsay. The "Laramie Sentinel" announced in 1889 that Bogan had been killed during a shootout in Mexico. In 1907 it was announced by yet another newspaper that he'd been killed when his horse bucked him, again in Mexico, suffering a broken neck. It was rumoured Bogan was killed while riding with bandits in Argentina, and also that he'd built a ranch there and prospered. In his book ""A Lonestar Cowboy"", published in 1919, Charlie Siringo revealed that he believed Bogan was still living, and that he had reason to believe Bogan had returned to the United States under yet another assumed name, married, settled in southwestern New Mexico, and raised a family on a small ranch. However, he never revealed the identity of who he believed Bogan to be, but suffice to say Siringo felt all but certain he knew these facts. In some support of Siringo's allegations, former Bogan friend A. C. Campbell stated in 1931 that the last he heard of Bogan, he was alive and well with a family, operating a small ranch under an assumed name in Texas.

It was opened by the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway in 1867 and renamed Stowe in 1874 and also known as Chartley and Stowe. Passenger services finished in 1939.
The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway was purchased for £100,000 by the Great Northern Railway in July 1881 and the line subsequently passed into LNER ownership with Railway Grouping in 1923.
In 1882 it was the scene of a serious accident. A special train had been provided for the Meynell Hunt. It left Derby Friargate with four horseboxes from GNR and the MS&LR plus three passenger carriages. At Sudbury six North Staffordshire horseboxes were added after the first coach, which was behind the engine. Thus only one vehicle was continuously braked. Although the driver was using care in approaching stations, he was being piloted by the fireman who knew the line, but not that the passing loop at Chartley had just been brought into use. The train approached Chartley at 30 to 35 miles an hour and the leading coach became derailed. This caused the horseboxes to strike the timber platform, causing severe damage, and several horses were killed or injured. Luckily none of the passengers or crew were hurt. The Inspecting Officer for the Board of Trade recommended that, in future, the facing points for all passing loops should be straight, with the "S" curve at the trailing end.

Spin-flip

A black hole spin-flip occurs when the spin axis of a rotating black hole undergoes a sudden change in orientation due to absorption of a second (smaller) black hole.
Spin-flips are believed to be a consequence of galaxy mergers, when two supermassive black holes form a bound pair at the center of the merged galaxy and coalesce after emitting gravitational waves.
Spin-flips are significant astrophysically since a number of physical processes are associated with black hole spins; for instance, jets in active galaxies are believed to be launched parallel to the spin axes of supermassive black holes.
A change in the rotation axis of a black hole due to a spin-flip would therefore result in a change in the direction of the jet.
Physics of Spin-Flips.
A spin-flip is a late stage in the evolution of a binary black hole. The binary consists of two black holes, with masses formula_1 and formula_2, that revolve around their common center of mass. The total angular momentum formula_3 of the binary system is the sum of the angular momentum of the orbit, formula_4, plus the spin angular momenta formula_5 of the two holes:
formula_6
If the orbital separation is sufficiently small, emission of energy and angular momentum in the form of gravitational radiation will cause the orbital separation to drop. Eventually, the smaller hole formula_2 reaches the innermost stable circular orbit, or ISCO, around the larger hole. Once the ISCO is reached, there no longer exists a stable orbit, and the smaller hole plunges into the larger hole, coalescing with it. The final angular momentum after coalescence is just
formula_8
the spin angular momentum of the single, coalesced hole. Neglecting the angular momentum that is carried away by gravitational waves during the final plunge—which is small -- conservation of angular momentum implies
formula_9
formula_10 is of order formula_11 times formula_12 and can be ignored if formula_2 is much smaller than formula_14. Making this approximation,
formula_15
This equation states that the final spin of the hole is the sum of the larger hole's initial spin plus the orbital angular momentum of the smaller hole at the last stable orbit. Since the vectors formula_12 and formula_17 are generically oriented in different directions, formula_18 will point in a different direction than formula_19 -- a spin-flip.
The angle by which the black hole's spin re-orients itself depends on the relative size of formula_20 and formula_21, and on the angle between them. At one extreme, if formula_19 is very small, the final spin will be dominated by formula_20 and the flip angle can be large. At the other extreme, the larger black hole might be a maximally-rotating Kerr black hole initially. Its spin angular momentum is then of order
formula_24
The orbital angular momentum of the smaller hole at the ISCO depends on the direction of its orbit, but is of order
formula_25
Comparing these two expressions, it follows that even a fairly small hole, with mass about one-fifth that of the larger hole, can reorient the larger hole by 90 degrees or more.
Connection with radio galaxies.
Black hole spin-flips were first discussed in the context of a particular class of radio galaxy, the X-shaped radio sources. The X-shaped galaxies exhibit two, misaligned pairs of radio lobes: the "active" lobes and the "wings". It is believed that the wings are oriented in the direction of the jet prior to the spin-flip, and that the active lobes point in the current jet direction. The spin-flip could have been caused by absorption of a second black hole during a galaxy merger.

Sandon railway station

Sandon railway station was a railway station opened by the North Staffordshire Railway to serve the village of Sandon, Staffordshire, England.
For some time it was called Sandon and Salt to avoid confusion with Salt and Sandon railway station opened by the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway in 1867.
Although in a country area and in some distance from the village it served, the station building was in an ornate Jacobean style with ornate gable ends and, on the entrance side, a substantial "Porte-cochère". This was for the convenience of Dudley Ryder, 2nd Earl of Harrowby, who was about to have a new Jacobethan country house built in nearby Sandon Park. There was a decorated timber awning and, on the opposite platform, a small but similarly elegant waiting-room.
It was built on the down, Stoke, side of the bridge of the present B5066 road, and at the other end was a long siding accessed from both running lines by trailing crossovers, with a short spur back to the station. To simplify shunting, authority had been given to use a tow rope which was kept beneath the signal box. Further along the line was a private siding belonging to the Earl to service his gasworks which was also controlled by Sandon box.
It was a busy main line but few trains called at the station. Under the 1923 grouping it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. By 1938 there were only two trains on weekdays and four on Saturdays. The LMS closed the station to passengers on 6 January 1947 and British Railways closed it to goods on 5 September 1955.
The station buildings gradually deteriorated until the Sandon Estate bought them in 1970. They were renovated in 1985 and are now a private home.
The line is still open as a diversion of the Trent Valley Line between Rugeley Trent Valley via Colwich Junction and Stone.

Stafford Common railway station

Stafford Common railway station was a former British railway station on the outskirts of Stafford.
It was opened by the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway in 1874 about seven years after the line opened. There was a single platform with a stationmaster's office and waiting room, but it included a goods yard and an engine shed. It became the headquarters of the line, to reduce dependence on the LNWR at Stafford station.
The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway was purchased for £100,000 by the Great Northern Railway in July 1881 and the line subsequently passed into LNER ownership with Railway Grouping in 1923.
The original station was to the southwest of the Marston Road bridge (now Common Road). When the GNR doubled the line, the station was rebuilt on the other side of the bridge and bordering on Aston Terrace. It had two platforms and opened in 1882. The station buildings were on the bridge, timber throughout, with covered steps to the platforms where there were small shelters.
Passenger services finished in 1939, though it remained open as Stafford Common Air Ministry Sidings until 1952. Both of the station's platforms remain in situ, albeit under vegetation, and the line through the station has been converted into a public footpath.
From there the line climbed steeply at 1 in 70 before falling at 1 in 75 to Salt and Sandon.

Shyamal Mitra

Shyamal Mitra (14 January 1929 – 15 November 1987) was a Bengali singer, composer and producer. Along with Hemanta Mukherjee and Manna Dey, he was the most notable musician of the golden era of Bengali music industry. His baritone voice reflected a range of emotions. Beside recording a huge number of popular Bengali basic songs, he also worked as playback singer in more than hundred Bengali movies and directed music in more that fifty Bengali films. He also sang in various other Indian languages, like Hindi, Assamese and Oriya.
Early life.
Shyamal Mitra was born in Naihati, a city near Kolkata, India. His father, Dr. Sadhan Kumar Mitra, was a reputed doctor over there. The father wanted his son to follow his foot steps and to become a doctor, but the son was very keen about music and always inspired by his mother and the local singer Mrinal Kanti Ghosh. People associated with the I.P.T.A. movement used to visit Sadhan-babu's house and this gave the chance to young Shyamal Mitra to come in contact with Salil Chowdhury. Young Shyamal Mitra and his youngest sister Reba used to sing "O Aalor Pathajatree" on the road for I.P.T.A.
Shyamal Mitra went to Hooghly Mohsin College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, for his graduation degree. There he met Satinath Mukhopadhyay, another prominent exponent of Modern music. Satinath inspired him like anything. Then Shyamal Mitra came to Kolkata and met Sudhirlal Chackraborty. That was the turning point of his life. He started struggling till he got a chance to playback in "Sunandar Biye", with Supriti Ghosh in 1949, and recorded his first basic songs from H.M.V. under the supervision of Sudhirlal Chackraborty. After the sad demise of Sudhirlal Chackraborty in 1952, he recorded "Smriti Tumi Bedonar". That was the turning point and he never looked back after that. He became one of the leading singer and composer of the country.
Journey as Musician.
Shyamal Mitra started working both as singer and music composer for the Bengali music industry. During the fifties and early sixties he composed music for hit films like "Joy Maa Kali Boarding", "Jamalaye Jibonto Manush", "Bhranti Bilash". During this period he also worked as playback singer in many Bengali films.
In 1963, he produced a film called "Deya Neya" and that film was another milestone of his career. Then he produced more films like "Rajkanya", "Kheya", and "Ami Se O Sakha". He was also the distributor and producer of "Nasimpur".
Shyamal Mitra went to Mumbai in early fifties with Salil Chowdhury. He worked in three films "Musafer", "Biraj Bou", and "Naukri". In 1973, he again went to Mumbai. He worked in Shakti Samanta's films, like "Amanush", "Ananda Ashram", F.C.Mehra's film "Bandi", Basu Chatterjee’s films like "Safed Jhooth", "Mamta" etc. He came back to Kolkata again and created many hit tracks in both Bengali basic and film songs.
Shyamal Mitra got a long association with All India Radio. He also sang in the famous Mahisasura Mardini programme of All India Radio.
Beside modern Bengali song and film song, Shyamal Mitra worked with many other different forms of Bengali music like Rabindrasangeet, Nazrul Geeti, "Chotoder Gaan", and Atul Prasadi. As a music composer, he also worked in a Yatra Pala called "Bibi Anondomoyee".
As music composer, Shyamal Mitra worked with almost all the major artists like Hemanta Kumar Mukhopadhyay, Tarun Bandyopadhyay, Dhananjay Bhattacharya, Pratima Bandyopadhyay, Sandhya Mukhopadhyay, Satinath Mukhopadhyay, Ila Basu, Supriti Ghosh, Gayatri Basu, Talat Mahmood.
As an actor, Shyamal Mitra, worked in couple of Bengali movies like Sharey Chuattar and Saapmochan.
Shyamal Mitra died in 15 November 1987, leaving behind his wife Protima Mitra, son Saibal Mitra and Saikat Mitra, daughter Monobina.
Bengali audience will never forget his songs like "Gaane Bhubon Bhoriye Debe", "Amar Sopne Dekha Rajkonyya", "Ami Tomar Kachei Phire Ashbo", "Ke Jane Kobe Abar", "O Mon Kokhon Suru", "Tinti Montro Niye Jader Jibon", "O Shimul Bon", "Emono Din Ashte Pare", "Sediner Sona Jhora Sondha", "Naam Rakhechi Bonolata", "Ei Sundor Prithibi Chere", and many others.

William J. Stewart (hydrographic surveyor)

William J. Stewart was Canada's first Chief Hydrographic Surveyor. Stewart Island, Algoma District, Ontario, and Stewart Rock, Owen Channel, Manitoulin District, Ontario, were named after him, as was the Canadian Hydrographic vessel William J. Stewart.
Education.
William J. Stewart was born in Ottawa on January 23, 1863, the son of a contractor in Ottawa and also Commanding Officer (Major) of the Ottawa Field Battery. He studied at Collegiate School (now Lisgar Collegiate) in Ottawa, Ontario. On February 5, 1880, at the age of 17, he joined Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, having taken first place in entrance marks in his class of seventeen. As Company Sergeant-Major in the Cadet Battalion, he graduated on June 26, 1883, at the top of his class. He was presented with the Governor General of Canada's Gold Medal, awarded to the cadet standing first in General Proficiency, as determined from the date of joining to that of graduation. RMC records show that he was 5′7″ tall, with dark complexion, brown hair and hazel eyes.
Career.
He started work for the Rideau Canal Office, Ottawa, and joined the one-year old Georgian Bay Survey (later to become the Canadian Hydrographic Service) on March 22, 1884, at an annual salary of $550. He took over as Canada’s First Chief Hydrographic Surveyor in 1893 and continued to survey in Georgian Bay and the North Channel until 1894. In 1891, he surveyed Burrard Inlet in British Columbia. In 1895-97, he with his ship Bayfield was in Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie and Lake Huron. In 1898, he was back at Parry Sound. During 1901, he took part in the first year of the Lake Winnipeg survey, but for the next two years, he was in Lake Superior surveying with a new Bayfield. He obtained his Master's Certificate, Inland Waters in 1897, though he never commanded his own survey ship.
He was a member of the International Waterways Commission in 1909. In 1912-13, he was appointed by the Dominion Government to determine the effect of the Chicago drainage scheme on the level of the lower St. Lawrence River. At the request of the British Government, he went to Europe to assist in layout the new international boundaries as determined by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles.
Honours.
To Canada's first Chief Hydrographer, Mr. R.J. Fraser wrote this tribute in later years, "about 170 navigation charts of Canada are either the product of his own skilled hand or result from the responsible planning and production during the years of his personal administration of the Service." A noble and parting tribute to a man who devoted forty-one years of his life in recharting Canada's inland and coastal waters, and to the heritage he left his successors.
He died on May 5, 1925, leaving his wife, Clara Lasher, and two unmarried daughters, Avis and Sybil. He was buried in Beechwood Cemetery, Ottawa.
In 2011, 85 William J Stewart was added to the wall of honour at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.

Dale Ockerman

Dale Ockerman is a keyboardist, guitarist and songwriter who has worked with a variety of internationally recognized musicians since the late 1960s. He is best known for his association with the Doobie Brothers, where he was principal keyboardist and a guitarist with the reformed version of the band during the 1988–1996 period.
History.
Prior to joining the Doobie Brothers, Ockerman had toured and co-written songs with Doobie Brothers' guitarist Patrick Simmons during the latter's solo tours. Four of his songs have been recorded by the The Doobie Brothers and he appears on ten of the CDs issued by the band. He also has a long-standing association with members of Moby Grape, and has contributed to the solo work of Jerry Miller and Bob Mosley. The Grape's Peter Lewis thought highly enough of 16-year-old Ockerman's talent that Lewis loaned him some of his prized guitars, a Martin D-28 and a Black Les Paul custom for a year, to further develop his playing skills.
Ockerman's first professional performance was with the Quicksilver Messenger Service in 1971, when the band performed during the last weekend of Bill Graham's Fillmore West in San Francisco. After Quicksilver Messenger Service, Ockerman played with a number of California-based acts, including IAM, Snail, Airtight, The Ducks, Bill Champlin, Rita Coolidge, Steve Marriott, Tom Johnston, Michael McDonald and Coco Montoya. He also played with New Orleans musicians Zigaboo Modeliste, George Porter, The Wild Magnolias and Cyril Neville. He also recorded with many of these performers, as well as worked as a session musician with Jim Keltner.
Recent Activities.
In recent years, Ockerman has been based in Santa Cruz and has appeared regularly with fellow Doobie bandmate Tiran Porter in The Santa Cruz White Album Ensemble, a group devoted to recreating Beatles music not generally having been performed by The Beatles in concert. The Santa Cruz White Album Ensemble, as described by Dale Ockerman: "Since 2003, an eight to fifteen piece ensemble performing live versions of Beatles albums that the fabs themselves never performed live, beginning with Rubber Soul, through Revolver, Sgt. Peppers, Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album, Let It Be, and Abbey Road. They use sitar, tablas, dilrhuba, tamboura, string quartets, choirs, whatever it takes to get the vibe across of the "classics of our time." The group has played numerous concerts with the Santa Cruz County Symphony.
In 2008, members of the White Album Ensemble (Dale Ockerman, Tiran Porter and Stephen Krilanovich) joined Omar Spence in tribute concerts featuring the music of his late father, Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence. The two concerts, at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz, and Don Quixote's International Music Hall in Felton, were recorded in anticipation of later 2009 release.
Ockerman is also associated with Musicscool Santa Cruz, where he teaches guitar, keyboards and other instruments. Through Ockerman's initiative, the school features a Hammond B3 organ and Leslie, once played by Booker T. Jones and Jimmy Smith, as well as a vintage Wurlitzer piano.
A group of Ockerman's young guitar and keyboard students, ages 11 and up, have performed concerts in Santa Cruz as GuitArmy - an "army of guitars", performing mostly Led Zeppelin songs, replicating all song parts and overdubs, such as blending electric, acoustic, slide, and twelve string guitars, as well as piano, organ and clavinet. GuitArmy features professional musicians Tiran Porter on bass and David Tucker (Maria Muldaur drummer and Musicscool teacher) on drums. Lead vocalist James Durbin, 19, also guested with the White Album Ensemble's "Across the Universe" concert in December 2008 and received a standing ovation for his vocal on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".

Sidney Eisenshtat

Sidney Eisenshtat (June 6, 1914 – March 1, 2005) was an American architect who was best known for his synagogues and 
Jewish academic buildings.
Biography.
Sidney Eisenshtat was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and his family later lived in Detroit, Michigan. The family moved to Los Angeles, California in 1926, reportedly in search of a less anti-Semitic atmosphere than they perceived in Detroit. He graduated from the University of Southern California architecture school in 1935. Early in his career he designed large projects for the United States Department of Defense, tract houses, and retail stores.
It was not until 1951 that he designed his first major religious structure, Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills, California. Eight years later he designed the landmark Sinai Temple on Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood district of Los Angeles, a building that has been compared to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and which is distinguished by its use of stained glass windows.
Eisenshtat said that his concept of synagogue design was based on his perception that, unlike in some religions, "in Judaism there is no intermediary. Therefore, I see the structure for synagogues not as pyramidal but as horizontal." Influenced by other modernist architects, notably Erich Mendelsohn, Eisenshat was noted for a use of expressive forms in thin shell concrete, white walls, simple materials, and natural light. Two of his most representative and distinguished buildings are set in arid desert environments. At Temple Mount Sinai in El Paso, Texas (1962) the Ark is a giant open tripod inside a soaring, tent-like concrete sanctuary; one writer has commented that this building "with its soaring arched shell seems to spring out of the rocky Texas soil" and gives the congregants a view of the mountains "through the high glazed arch behind the Ark." This building is also featured in the book "American Synagogues" by noted architecture critic Samuel D. Gruber, and described as "a dramatically sculptural building perfect for its austere setting." 
The futuristic House of the Book, built in the early 1970s as the synagogue for the Brandeis-Bardin Institute, is set among the Santa Susana Mountains near Simi Valley, California, and is used as a filming location for science-fiction and other productions, notably including "",
Eisenshtat's design for the House at the University of Southern California was described as one of his best buildings by USC architecture professor James Steele, who said it was representative of "his personality and his attitude toward Judaism," with a building that is "very open, free, full of light," but surrounded by a "bunker"-like "defensive wall."
Eisenshtat also designed the master plan for the campus of the University of Judaism (now American Jewish University) in Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California, completed in 1977. His notable secular buildings include the Friars Club and Union Bank buildings in Beverly Hills and the Sven Lokrantz School for disabled children in Reseda.
An observant Orthodox Jew, Eisenshtat reportedly did not accept fees for his synagogue projects. He was honored as a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1986. He died in 2005 at age 90. USC's Architectural Guild Press has announced that a monograph about Eisenshtat's work is under production, to be written by USC professor James Steele.

<doc id="19621701" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19621701" title="Ulteo Open Virtual Desktop">
Ulteo Open Virtual Desktop

Ulteo Open Virtual Desktop (OVD) is an open source Application Delivery and Virtual Desktop infrastructure project that can deliver applications or a desktop hosted on a Linux or Windows server to end users. It is an open source alternative to Citrix and VMware solutions and, as of June 2012, the only presentation virtualization solution supporting both Linux and Windows applications. It was created by Gaël Duval, who previously created Mandriva Linux.
Features.
Ulteo OVD provides access to applications or an entire desktop session hosted on a Linux or Windows (2003 or later) server. These are executed in a virtual session on the server (as opposed to simple display mirroring). Version 3 introduced RDP as the protocol used for both Linux and Windows applications. Sessions can be accessed through a web portal, using any Java-capable browser, or integrated into the local desktop environment and launched like local applications. Remote applications can access local file systems (including network and USB), print to local printers, play sound locally and copy to or paste from the local clipboard.
Users can authenticate through Microsoft Active Directory or any LDAP or CAS server. Support for additional authentication mechanisms, including single sign-on, can be implemented using an open API. While Ulteo can use any standard CIFS server (such as Samba, Windows file servers or dedicated appliances), a dedicated WebDAV file server is also available.
The environment can be configured and monitored through a web-based administration interface. A farm can include multiple application servers, running a mix of Linux and Windows, and the administrator can configure load balancing between them based on criteria such as processor load, memory usage, number of open sessions or random distribution. Ulteo states that a single farm can serve up to 50,000 users and more.
An SSL gateway is available to deploy applications over the Internet.
Ulteo is distributed as a set of application packages which can be installed on a standard Linux distribution (Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Redhat Enterprise Linux), with Windows installers also available for some components.
A live DVD (Demo) is available for testing purposes. It contains a full Linux distribution (based on Ubuntu) and all Ulteo components, allowing an Ulteo OVD farm to be quickly installed on a single server. Additionally, the DVD contains the full documentation and installation sources for all supported operating systems. A virtual appliance image is also available.
Modules.
Ulteo OVD uses several modules with different roles. The Session Manager, at least one Application Server and the client component required, while the others are optional. Each module comes with a binary installation package for Linux and Windows. Some of the optional modules are Premium modules (formerly known as Gold modules), requiring users to purchase a subscription in order to get a binary installation package (although the source code is freely available).
Session Manager.
This server is the central piece of an Ulteo OVD architecture. It manages the session launching and hosts the administration console. It is the first module to install. A binary installation package is only available for Linux at the moment, although it can be installed from source on Windows. The Session Manager may be installed on an Application Server, but this setup is not recommended for production environments.
High Availability.
This add-on allows setting up two physical Session Managers and databases in a cold-standby cluster. Data is replicated between the two databases using DRBD, and failover is handled by the Heartbeat cluster manager. High Availability is a Premium module.
Application Server.
These are the servers that run the published applications or desktops. They can be running Linux or Windows, depending on the type of applications or desktop to be delivered. Mixing Linux and Windows servers in an Ulteo OVD farm is supported.
Client.
In order to start an Ulteo OVD session, the client device needs to run an Ulteo OVD Client. A Java client which runs in the browser is available, an HTML5 client was announced in September 2012 and is currently in beta (as of July 2013). Native clients are available as Premium modules for Linux and Windows, as well as for Android and iOS tablets (although the tablet clients support only published desktops).
File Server.
Ulteo OVD includes an optional file server to host user profiles or shared folders, ensuring user access to the same files when using applications from different servers. Currently only a Linux version is available. The File Server may be installed on an Application Server.
Gateway.
This module facilitates deployment of Ulteo OVD applications over the Internet by tunneling connections to application servers through an SSL (443) connection. This eliminates the requirement to expose individual application servers with a public IP address. It also eases access for clients which are behind firewalls, as many firewall environments allow outgoing SSL traffic on port 443 with no further restrictions. The Gateway is a Premium module.
Reception.
A review by The Virtualization Practice advises organizations that have an open-source policy, are cost-sensitive or need a simple solution to consider Ulteo OVD. It considers version 3 a viable alternative to competing solutions, having overcome many critical limitations of its predecessor. The switch from VNC to RDP as the transport protocol brought about significant improvements in performance, desktop integration (e.g. printing and audio) and client device support. Other improvements include support for application silos, firewall traversal and better LDAP support. It criticized a lack of high availability support for the Session Manager, making it a single point of failure as of version 3. (The High Availability module for the Session Manager was not mentioned.) In addition, Ulteo OVD was found to suffer from the traditional issues of remote application delivery – poor video performance and limited interaction with devices connected locally to the client.

Fushun War Criminals Management Centre

Fushun War Criminals Management Centre (), also known as Liaodong No. 3 Prison or Liaoning No. 3 Prison was the site of the re-education of Manchuko, Kuomintang and Japanese prisoners of war, held by China from 1950 onwards. It was located in the Xinfu District, Fushun, Liaoning. Among the inmates were Puyi, the last emperor of China and former puppet emperor of Manchukuo, his younger brother Pujie and several other important World War II figures such as Xi Qia, Zang Shiyi and Zhang Jinghui. Part of the prison site remains in use, but the older section has been turned into a museum depicting the history of Fushun war criminals management centre and the life of the people who worked or were interned there.
The prison was originally constructed in 1936 by the occupying Japanese. At the end of World War II, the USSR had overrun the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and captured many of its government members and military personnel, both Chinese and Japanese. These prisoners were held near Khabarovsk (Boli) in the Russian Far East. During 1949 and early 1950, the Chinese sent delegations to the USSR headed by Mao Zedong in which they secured the extradition of these prisoners to China. Premier Zhou Enlai instructed the Northeast Judicial Department to make preparations for handling the war criminals. Liaodong No. 3 prison, on the northern edge of Fushun city, was selected for conversion into the War Criminals Management Centre.
The first train carrying prisoners arrived in Fushun station at 3 o'clock on July 21, 1950. They were then transferred the short distance to the prison by bus. In this first train load there were 969 Japanese detainees and 71 prisoners from the Manchukuo puppet regeme. Some other Japanese prisoners were transferred from other locations such as Taiyuan War Criminals Management Centre, to bring the total number of Japanese prisoners to 982. The Japanese prisoners can be divided by occupation into 667 army personnel, 116 gendarme, 155 special police and 44 administrative. Of these 35 had the rank of general, 125 were field officers and 852 were junior officers or below. Alongside these prisoners from World War II were inmates from the Chinese Civil War that ended in 1949. These Kuomintang prisoners numbered 354. 
In 1956, trials of the Japanese prisoners were undertaken. Over the period 1956 to 1964, the Japanese prisoners were all released. Between 1959 and 1975, the Manchukuo and Kuomintang prisoners received special pardons and were released in stages. In total over 1300 prisoners had passed through the centre. 
The Fushun War Criminals Management Centre was converted, in 1986, to a museum and opened to the public. The War Criminals Management Centre was depicted in several scenes of the 1987 Bernardo Bertolucci film, "The Last Emperor", which won 9 Oscars.

Aburagi Dam

Aburagi Dam (油木ダム) is a dam built upstream on the class-B Imagawa River, located in the town of Soeda, in the Tagawa District of Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.
It is a gravity dam made of concrete, 54.6 meters in height. The dam is owned at a prefectural level but managed by the Tagawa Public Works Office in Fukuoka Prefecture. An auxiliary multi-purpose dam, Aburagi Dam provides flood control for the Imagawa River and agricultural irrigation for the Tagawa District, as well as general irrigation for Kitakyūshū and the Kyoto District. It is also a major supplier of water to Kitakyūshū. 
The reservoir created by the dam remains unnamed, despite having been completed nearly 40 years ago.
Geography.
The Imagawa River is a medium-sized, class-B river covering 120.0 square kilometers, extending 38.7 kilometers in length. It is located in the Buzen district of Fukuoka Prefecture, and is representative of other class-B rivers like the Murasakigawa River and Haraigawa River. The source of the river is at the base of a sightseeing area—Mount Hiko—which is located in Yaba-Hita-Hikosan Quasi-National Park. The river flows northeast, pouring into the Suonada Sound near the city of Yukihashi. The watershed crosses the city of Yukihashi, as well as the Kyoto District's towns of Kanda and Miyako and the Tagawa District's town of Soeda and Aka village, and serves as an important water source. The dam is built on the upper reach of the river at the town of Soeda and the former village of Tsuno.
History.
After the (then-government managed) Yawata Works steel company commenced operations in the Kitakyūshū area, the heavy chemical industry rapidly began the flourish, and the local population increased. The supply of water established during the Meiji period had become insufficient, leading Yawata Works to construct several dams to supply municipal water, such as the Kawachi Dam. This area experiences Setonaikai climate patterns, with low annual rainfall, and frequently faces water shortages; the expansion of the Kitakyūshū Industrial Zone further worsened these water shortages. The river basin was once part of the Ogasawara clan's Kokura Domain, a grain producing region where some 150,000 units of grain were produced annually. However, due to the aforementioned Setonaikai climate, farmwater was in extremely short supply. To help alleviate the problem, the Kyoto and Tagawa districts had several agricultural-use reservoirs built, but this wasn't a fundamental solution to the problem.
Maintenance of the Imagawa River hadn't progressed by much. While the area normally suffered from water damage, the June 1953 Kitakyūshū Flood wreaked havoc upon the Chikugogawa, Ongagawa, and many other rivers in the Kitakyūshū area. Many levees were destroyed, causing substantial destruction. Due to the damage caused by the heavy rains, the Ministry of Construction (now the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) began the Comprehensive River Development Project for the Chikugogawa River; the project was widely expanded to cover repairs to the Ongagawa River and Imagawa River basins in Fukuoka Prefecture, though comprehensive repairs to the Imagawa River basin proved difficult due to its relatively large population and abundance of farmlands.
In 1950, the second Yoshida cabinet enacted the Comprehensive National Land Development bill. The bill was meant to accelerate local development in an attempt to revitalize the exhausted Japanese economy after the Pacific War. The bill designated 22 localities for development as part of the "Special Regional Comprehensive Development Plan." "Tsushima," "Aso," and "Southern Kyūshū" were selected from within Kyūshū. To rebuild and strengthen the Kitakyūshū Industrial Zone—heavily damaged as a result of air raids during the war—the entire Kitakyūshū area was named under the Kitakyūshū Special Regional Comprehensive Development Plan. Irrigation improvements were concurrently planned, as securing water was necessary for industrial districts, as well as expanding farming areas to deal with food shortages. The plan was strengthened by the Japanese post-war economic recovery, and further expanded under the National Comprehensive Development Plan.
Based on this perspective, the Ongagawa, Murasakigawa and Imagawa River water systems—the largest rivers in Kitakyūshū—were at the center of the Comprehensive River Development Project, with flood prevention of the river basins, improved water supply, and expanded irrigation forming the heart of the project. Fukuoka Prefecture pressed forward with construction of multi-purpose dams, and with support from the national treasury, the Rikimaru Dam on the Yakiyamagawa River (part of the Ongagawa River water system), the Jinya Dam on the Chūganjigawa River, and the Masubuchi Dam on the Murasakigawa River were planned. River development projects in the form of multi-purpose dams were also drawn up for the Imagawa River water system, and in 1965 a dam in Aburagi, which is in the Tagawa District's Tsuno, entered into construction under the Imagawa Comprehensive Development Project. This became Aburagi Dam.
Compensation.
Plans to build the dam were unveiled in 1961. The reasons for the selection of the specific location of the dam at a contracted point of the Imagawa River were that it was possible to secure an ample amount of active water storage capacity, and it was effective from a cost-performance perspective. However, after construction plans were unveiled, residents of the Tsuno area unanimously opposed the dam's creation. The reservoir area that would be created by the dam would be centered on Tsuno, and not only houses but town offices and public facilities would be submerged. Residents were fearful for their livelihoods, and requested large sums as compensation for relocation, complicating compensation negotiations. As the backer of the plan, Fukuoka Prefecture frequently entered into compensation negotiations, but talks continued at length for 3 years.
In March 1968, 7 years after the plan to build the dam was initially unveiled, representatives of the residents reached an agreement on compensation negotiations, and construction was authorized to commence. However, the construction of the dam meant that 155 city-maintained residencies, as well as the Soeda town Hall, Tsuno Branch Office, elementary and junior high schools, post office, police substation, fire department branch office, community center, and agricultural cooperative branch office would all become submerged. Aburagi was thus sacrificed for the development of Kitakyūshū. Construction began, and areas where the ground quality was poor were reinforced with water-impermeable concrete walls, eventually leading to the dam's completion in 1971, 9 years after construction plans were announced.
During dry periods, the former village of Tsuno—as well the bridge built across the Imagawa River and stone walls built around former residences—can still be seen sunken at the bottom of the dam. The submerged bridge across the Imagawa River actually became visible above the water during times of water shortage during 1994, and again in 2002 and 2007.
Purpose.
Aburagi Dam is used for flood control, unspecified water utilization, and tap water provision, as well as industrial water provision and hydroelectricity generation, making the dam's purposes numerous even among multi-purpose dams. 
Based on these objectives, Aburagi Dam—along with Rikimaru Dam, Masubuchi Dam, the Tonda Reservoirs #1 and #2, Hata Dam, and Matsugae Dam—contributes to Kitakyūshū's water storage. Aburagi Dam, the Ongagawa River estuary barrage, Heisei Ozeki Dam, Yamakunigawa River's Yabakei Dam and other government-controlled dams provide a stable supply of water to Kitakyūshū and the Kitakyūshū Industrial Zone.
More recently, however, serious water shortages have occurred with more frequency as a result of intense heat, rainless rainy seasons, and the natural Setonaikai climate. Aburagi Dam has frequently been put under water restrictions; in response to these shortages, the Irahara Dam on the upper stream of the Haraigawa River (which is adjacent to the east of Imagawa River) is currently being constructed. The municipalities of the Keichiku region and Tagawa have been given priority water usage rights, as they have lacked any other large water source amid water shortages of recent years. During water shortages, the amount of water sent to Kitakyūshū is heavily cut and redirected to the undersupplied Keichiku region, but this is not a fundamental solution to the water shortage issue.
Access.
To access Aburagi Dam from Route 201 (Sasaguri Highway), transfer to Prefectural Highway 418 from central Kawara in the Tagawa District, and continue south toward Mount Hiko. From the city of Yukihashi, take the Yukihashi/Soeda Line on Fukuoka Prefectural Highway 34 westward toward the village of Aka, turn left at the village of Aka onto Prefectural Highway 418, and follow the road to Aburagi Dam. Using public transportation, take the Heisei Chikuhō Railway Tagawa Line and get off at Aka Station, or take the Kyushu Railway Company Hitahiko Line and get off at Soeda Station.

National Debt Clock

The National Debt Clock is a billboard-sized running total dot-matrix display which constantly updates to show the current United States gross national debt and each American family's share of the debt. It is currently installed on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.
The idea for the clock came from New York real estate developer Seymour Durst, who wanted to highlight the rising national debt. In 1989, he sponsored the installation of the first clock, which was originally placed on Sixth Avenue—between 42nd Street and 43rd Street—one block away Times Square. At the time, the national debt remained under $3 trillion but was rising. The clock was temporarily switched off from 2000 to 2002 due to the debt actually falling during that period.
In 2004, the original clock was dismantled and replaced by the current clock at the new location one block away. In 2008, the U.S. national debt exceeded $10 trillion for the first time, leading to press reports that the clock had run out of digits.
The original clock outlived Seymour, who died in 1995, with Seymour's son Douglas taking over responsibility for the clock through the Durst Organization. As of September 2009, Douglas Durst's cousin Jonathan "Jody" Durst, with whom he currently shares a co-presidency of the company, is in the process of taking over the day-to-day operations as president. In an interview with "The New York Times", Jonathan Durst has said that maintenance of the clock is planned "for years to come."
History.
Clock concept.
Invented and sponsored by New York real estate developer Seymour Durst, the National Debt Clock was installed in 1989. After Seymour's death in 1995, his son Douglas Durst became president of the Durst Organization which owns and maintains the clock.
Douglas Durst has been quoted as saying that the clock represents a non-partisan effort; he has further explained the motivation behind the project in terms of intergenerational equity: "We're a family business. We think generationally, and we don't want to see the next generation crippled by this burden."
According to Douglas Durst, his father had been toying with the basic idea of drawing attention to the growing national debt since at least 1980, when during the holiday season he sent cards that said "Happy New Year. Your share of the national debt is $35,000" to senators and congressmen. In the early eighties, when Durst first developed the idea of a constantly updated clock, the technology required to implement the project was not yet available.
First clock.
With the national debt at 2.7 trillion dollars, the original clock was constructed in 1989 at a cost of $100,000. It was mounted a block from Times Square, on a Durst building at Sixth Avenue near 42nd Street, facing the north side of 42nd Street and Bryant Park across the intersection. Built by the New York sign company Artkraft Strauss, the clock featured a dot-matrix display with the then-typical character resolution of 5x7. Similar to the second clock, the updating mechanism was such that the display was set to the estimated speed of debt growth (odometer-style) and adjusted weekly according to the latest numbers published by the United States Treasury. Up until the week before his death, Seymour Durst himself adjusted the tally via modem. Since his passing, Artkraft Strauss has been keeping the figures current.
In 2000, due to an improving debt situation, the clock started to run backward. With the original purpose of the clock being to highlight the rising debt and the reverse giving a mixed message, and with the display not being designed to properly run backward, the clock was unplugged and covered with a red, white and blue curtain in September 2000, with the national debt standing at roughly 5.7 trillion dollars. The clock was not dismantled, however, and in July 2002 the curtain was raised and the clock once again picked up tracking a rising debt, starting at 6.1 trillion dollars.
Second clock.
In 2004, the original clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street; the building has since made way for One Bryant Park. An updated model, which can run backward, was installed one block away on a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas (more commonly known as 1133 Sixth Avenue). It is mounted on the side wall of the building which faces W. 44th Street. The new clock is outfitted with a dot-matrix display of higher resolution than its predecessor which emulates the customary seven-segment numeral patterns, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.
In the midst of extensive media attention during the financial crisis beginning in 2007, some news reports mentioned the National Debt Clock, highlighting the fact that its display had run out of digits when the U.S. gross federal debt rose above $10 trillion on September 30, 2008.
An overhaul or complete replacement adding two more digits to the clock's display is currently being planned.
Similar projects.
The idea of conveying a message through a periodically updated clock found an earlier expression in the Doomsday Clock. However, the innovation of the National Debt Clock was to feature a constantly running counter; it has since inspired similar projects elsewhere, both in the United States and further afield. Various tracking counters of national debt are also kept online.
The National Debt Clock has also been credited as the inspiration behind other running totalisers, for example an AMD campaign employing an electronic billboard; instead of a debt, it tracked the supposed additional cost of using a rival chip.

Arenaria paludicola

Arenaria paludicola is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names marsh sandwort and swamp sandwort. The plant grows in wet areas, such as marsh and bog. 
Distribution.
It is native to the west coast of North America in California, where it is known from only a few remaining occurrences in the Central Coast of California region. It is a federally listed endangered species in the United States. It is present in two native locations in San Luis Obispo County, California, and it has been reintroduced nearby in Nipomo and Los Osos. It is known from historical occurrences in Washington, but it may have been extirpated from that state. The plant may still exist in northern Mexico, but these occurrences are unconfirmed. 
Description.
This is a perennial herb which grows erect or trailing and draping over nearby plants and other objects for support. The slender stems are hairless and shiny, sometimes grooved, and approach 90 centimeters in maximum length. The stem has nodes at intervals and the nodes may root. Leaves are very narrow and lance-shaped. 
The inflorescence is composed of a single white flower. The fruit is a toothed capsule containing up to 20 tiny brown kidney-shaped seeds. Threats to the survival of this species include the destruction and alteration of its wetland habitat, shrinking of the local water table, and human activities such as off-roading.

Charles Aitken

Charles Aitken CB (12 September 1869 – 9 August 1936) was a British art administrator and was the third Keeper of the Tate Gallery (1911–1917) and the first Director (1917–1930).
Life and work.
Charles Aitken was born at Bishophill, Bishophill Junior, York, England, the son of Henry Martin Aitken, a surgical instrument manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Atkinson. Aitken studied at New College, Oxford.
He was the first Director of the Whitechapel Art Gallery from 1901 to 1911, and became Keeper at the Tate Gallery in 1911. In 1917 he changed his title from "Keeper" to "Director". Sir John Rothenstein described Aitken as "an ordinary man: his intelligence was relatively pedestrian, his powers of self-expression scarcely adequate". However, Rothenstein considered that the job "brought out qualities that made him a great director: clarity and firmness of purpose".
When one of the greatest collections of the works of William Blake came on the open market, Aitken, who had no purchasing budget, put together a consortium to save it. Because of the problems caused by dark or foggy days, when the public could not see the artwork by natural light and attendants cleared the galleries due to the difficulty of proper surveillance, Aitken decided to install electric lighting. He also introduced the sale of prints, photographs and catalogues of the Collection.
After Aitken commissioned Rex Whistler to decorate the Tate's Refreshment Room with a mural, he persuaded Sir Joseph Duveen, an influential art dealer, to finance a similar scheme. Having chosen Morley College in London for the location of the new mural, Aitken and Duveen invited William Rothenstein, the Principal of the Royal College of Art, to submit the names and designs of six young students and ex-students to design the mural. The three chosen students were Edward Bawden, Eric Ravilious and Cyril Mahoney. The mural took them a total of two years to complete.
When the art critic of "The Daily Telegraph" wrote an article claiming that the sculptures of Jacob Epstein had been universally condemned by critics, Epstein wrote instancing the support of Aitken among other leading names in the art world. In 1909 Aitken co-founded the Modern Art Association, which in 1910 was renamed the Contemporary Art Society.
Following his retirement from the position of Director in 1930, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1931 King's Birthday Honours. He died on 9 August 1936.

Rainton Meadows

Rainton Meadows is a nature reserve just to the east of East Rainton, Sunderland, north-east England. The reserve, which covers 60 ha, and the adjacent Joe's Pond Site of Special Scientific Interest, are managed by Durham Wildlife Trust.
Information.
The reserve occupies the site of the restored Rye Hill surface coal mine and now provides a wide variety of habitats including grassland, scrub, mature woodland and several ponds. Wildlife to be seen here includes mute swan, skylark, lapwing, short-eared owl and brown hare; roe deer, water voles, dragonflies, frogs, toads and smooth newts are also present. At the southern end of the reserve are damp meadows with hemlock and willowherb, and a dry meadow, which contains cowslips in the spring.
Rainton Meadows is the headquarters of the Durham Wildlife Trust, which also operates an educational centre, including a purpose-built classroom and a community wildlife garden.
Directions.
Rainton Meadows can be found by following the brown signs from the A690 between Durham and Sunderland. By bus, the service 20 regularly leaves Park Lane in Sunderland, or the bus station in Durham and sets down at the nearby Mill Inn. There's a short walk under the A690 continuing until you reach the last roundabout of the industrial estate. The entrance to the Reserve is called Mallard Way.

George Samuel Fereday Smith

George Samuel Fereday Smith (7 May 1812–26 May 1891) was an English industrialist and canal manager who from 1837 to 1887 was the Deputy Superintendent of the Bridgewater Trustees and their successors, whose major source of income came from the Bridgewater Canal.
Early life and education.
Fereday Smith was born in 1812 at Tipton, Staffordshire, the elder son of Richard Smith, an ironmaster and Elizabeth Fereday, the daughter of Samuel Fereday, who was also an ironmaster. He was educated at Charterhouse and University College, London before going to Queen's College, Oxford where he graduated as Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and physics in 1835. He then went to Germany to study mining and geology, after which he returned to Staffordshire where he gained practical experience of mining and surveying. At the beginning of 1837 he was working as an engineer on the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, when in March, at the age of 24, he was appointed as Deputy Superintendent of the Bridgewater Trustees at a salary of £600 a year.
Career.
The Superintendent of the Bridgewater Trustees was James Loch. Loch was extremely busy because of his involvement in other matters, which left Fereday Smith in charge of the detailed administration of the Trust. In addition to the Bridgewater Canal, the Trust administered the Bridgewater Collieries, the home farms, the Bridgewater Estate, a lime-burning business, Worsley Yard and, from 1848, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. During this time the canals were in serious competition with the railways and Fereday Smith met the competition "with great vigour". He was greatly in favour of capital investment and the facilities he instigated included Egerton Dock at Liverpool, the Runcorn and Weston Canal, and the Alfred Dock at Runcorn. He installed electric telegraph along the banks of the canal.
Fereday Smith and James Lock were not always in agreement, but Fereday Smith's influence in the business increased after Loch's death in 1855. From that time he was in effect the general manager of the undertaking, Loch's successor Algernon Egerton having less influence than Loch. During the time of Fereday Smith's management, the profit from the canal and the collieries increased considerably. He continued in his post when the control of the business passed from the Trustees to the Bridgewater Navigation Company in 1872 but retired when the Manchester Ship Canal Company took over ownership in 1887.
Personal life and honours.
In 1845 Fereday Smith married Mary Jane Hampson and the couple had two daughters and a son. He became financially prosperous, partly from his income, which had increased to £1,500 a year by 1864, and partly through a private income gained through his marriage. In his late thirties he studied at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1852. He had wide interests outside the Trust. He was a fellow of the Geological Society and the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the Chetham Society. He served as a Conservative councillor in Manchester from 1846 to 1849 and was also a borough magistrate. In the early 1870s he bought Grovehurst, a country house in Kent, and was appointed High Sheriff of Kent in 1884. He died in London in 1891 and was succeeded in his post by his son, Richard Clifford Smith.

Cusihuiriachi

Cusihuiriachi is a town in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Although it is now practically a ghost town, it serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. "Cusihuiriachi" is a Tarahumara word meaning "erect pole".
Cusihuiriachi's population has fallen dramatically over the past century, from 1,755 in 1900 to 75 in 2005. By the 2010 census, it was down to 63. This was largely due to the closure of the local silver mines.

Casal Vasco is a small village in Portugal. It belongs to the municipality of Fornos de Algodres, district of Guarda. It's also located in the former region of Beira Alta. It has an area of 6,44 km² and 269 inhabitants (Census 2001). Its density is 41,8 hab/km². Includes the place of "Ramirão" and the "Quinta das Moitas".
No one really knows when Casal Vasco was founded, but the first documentation of the village's existence a list of Portuguese villages from 1527. Ever since, Casal Vasco is a place where most of the people dedicated their lives to agriculture. 
Casal Vasco has a rich heritage which includes:
It also has a big tradition of legends, theater, traditional games, gastronomy and crafts (pieces made in wood and embroidery).

Experiment (probability theory)

In probability theory, an experiment or trial (see below) is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space. An experiment is said to be "random" if it has more than one possible outcome, and "deterministic" if it has only one. A random experiment that has exactly two (mutually exclusive) possible outcomes is known as a Bernoulli trial.
When an experiment is conducted, one (and only one) outcome results— although this outcome may be included in any number of events, all of which would be said to have occurred on that trial. After conducting many trials of the same experiment and pooling the results, an experimenter can begin to assess the empirical probabilities of the various outcomes and events that can occur in the experiment and apply the methods of statistical analysis.
Experiments and trials.
Random experiments are often conducted repeatedly, so that the collective results may be subjected to statistical analysis. A fixed number of repetitions of the same experiment can be thought of as a composed experiment, in which case the individual repetitions are called trials. For example, if one were to toss the same coin one hundred times and record each result, each toss would be considered a trial within the experiment composed of all hundred tosses.
Mathematical description.
A random experiment is described or modeled by a mathematical construct known as a probability space. A probability space is constructed and defined with a specific kind of experiment or trial in mind.
A mathematical description of an experiment consists of three parts:
An "outcome" is the result of a single execution of the model. Since individual outcomes might be of little practical use, more complicated "events" are used to characterize groups of outcomes. The collection of all such events is a "sigma-algebra" formula_1. Finally, there is a need to specify each event's likelihood of happening; this is done using the "probability measure" function, "P".
Once an experiment is designed and established, it is assumed that “nature” makes its move and selects a single outcome, "ω", from the sample space Ω. All the events in formula_1 that contain the selected outcome "ω" (recall that each event is a subset of Ω) are said to “have occurred”. The probability function "P" is defined in such a way that, if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times, the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would approach agreement with the values "P" assigns them.

Barnes integral

In mathematics, a Barnes integral or Mellin–Barnes integral is a contour integral involving a product of gamma functions. They were introduced by . They are closely related to generalized hypergeometric series.
The integral is usually taken along a contour which is a deformation of the imaginary axis passing to the left of all poles of factors of the form Γ("a" + "s") and to the right of all poles of factors of the form Γ("a" − "s").
Hypergeometric series.
The hypergeometric function is given as a Barnes integral by 
This equality can be obtained by moving the contour to the right while picking up the residues at "s" = 0, 1, 2, ... . Given proper convergence conditions, one can relate more general Barnes' integrals and generalized hypergeometric functions "p""F""q" in a similar way.
Barnes lemmas.
The first Barnes lemma states
This is an analogue of Gauss's 2"F"1 summation formula, and also an extension of Euler's beta integral. The integral in it is sometimes called Barnes's beta integral. 
The second Barnes lemma states
where "e" = "a" + "b" + "c" − "d" + 1. This is an analogue of Saalschütz's summation formula.
q-Barnes integrals.
There are analogues of Barnes integrals for basic hypergeometric series, and many of the other results can also be extended to this case .
