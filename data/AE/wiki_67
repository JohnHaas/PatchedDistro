Sts. Ingenuin and Albuin Church

Sts. Ingenuin and Albuin Church () is a Catholic church located in the village of Koroška Bela, in the municipality of Jesenice in northwestern Slovenia. The church is dedicated to St. Ingenuin and St. Albuin, bishops of Säben Abbey from the 6th and 10th centuries respectively.
History.
The predecessor of the current building was a Gothic church also dedicated to the two saints, as is the chapel of nearby Bled Castle, which dates from roughly the same time frame. Consecration was on 26 April 1361; the altar of Saint Acacius () was dedicated the next year by John, bishop of Urbin and papal vicar general.
Due to defilement of the church by Turkish raiders, the altar was reconsecrated on 2 October 1486 by Ljubljana bishop Žiga the noble Lambergar. In 1584, during the Reformation, local Lutherans came into conflict with ecclesiastical authorities, some confrontations apparently taking place in the church. The protestant minority was subsequently expelled from the area.
In 1691, the church was granted special rights. By 1752, the building had grown dilapidated as well as too small, and a decision was reached to replace it, with what would become the present church. Experts believe the architect was one Matija Perski. Collection of funds began immediately; loans were extended by the churches at Blejska Dobrava, Rečica (now part of Bled), and Kupljenik pod Babjim Zobom. In addition to popular contributions, the then-parish church in Jesenice made a gift. The ironworking facilities in Javornik were unable to help due to their own difficulties.
The old church was demolished in 1754; the year is marked on the keystone of the main portico. Construction took seven years, and was sufficiently far along that consecration was planned for the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul of 1761 when - two days beforehand, on 27 June 1761 - the entire village of 60 houses burned down, including the church.
Reconstruction took ten years; the new church was finally consecrated on 3 September 1771 by Ljubljana bishop Count Carl Herberstein. In 1788, the church was granted greater privileges.
Due to another disaster, a massive landslide in 1789, furnishing the new church had to be deferred. The only new element commissioned was the baroque altar of St. Ahac, kept fairly modest due to circumstances. Records describe it as a humble wooden structure with statues of the two patron saints in niches, and an oil painting of the saints before lake Bled overhead.
The side altar of the Virgin of the Rosary was the work of Ignacij Arer (1776, restored around 1867). The ceiling was decorated by an unknown artist in 1828, but required repairs by 1858, performed by painter Matevž Goričnik. The 16-station Way of the Cross was the work of Goetzla from Kranj. An organ was purchased from Kropa manufacturer Ignac Zupan, but was - due to poor quality - replaced in 1893 by a Gorščič organ, still there today. In 1875, the Koroška Bela parish was established, as a suffragan of Jesenice parish; St. Ingenuin and St. Albuin's became the parish church. 
Amid the effort to equip it properly, however, the church was struck by another calamity: on June 2, 1875, the building was struck by lightning, killing the priest Valentin Plemlj and starting a fire which destroyed the bell tower and roof. The village spent several years making external repairs, then returned to the project of beautifying the interior. In 1903 the current altar painting was purchased, the work of the artist Kaestner from Tirol. In 1906, the old and damaged wooden altar was replaced with a marble one carved by A. Rovšek of Ljubljana, and marble communion tables were added. 
In 1916, due to the need for raw materials for the war effort, Austro-Hungarian soldiers removed the bells; one year later, on August 14, 1917, the village and church were badly damaged and set alight by an Italian air raid. The extent of the devastation was such that it took six years to rebuild the bell tower, and longer to fix the roof. Some of the repairs were temporary, with decades needed before a permanent fix; other traces of damage were never fully addressed and are still evident.
To date, the tower and roof have had to be rebuilt four times each.
During the 1920s, the interior frescoes were repainted by Matej Sternen. The current bells were blessed on 16 November 1986, while the facade of the church was restored in 1990. The fifth consecration of the altar of St. Ahac was on February 8, 1998.

Broughton Suspension Bridge

Broughton Suspension Bridge was a suspended-deck suspension bridge built in 1826 to span the River Irwell between Broughton and Pendleton, now in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. One of Europe's first suspension bridges, 
it has been attributed to Samuel Brown, though some suggest it was built by Thomas Cheek Hewes, a Manchester millwright and textile machinery manufacturer.
On 12 April 1831, the bridge collapsed, reportedly due to mechanical resonance induced by troops marching in step. and as a result of the incident, the British Army issued an order that troops should "break step" when crossing a bridge. Though rebuilt and strengthened, the bridge was subsequently propped with temporary piles whenever crowds were expected. In 1924 it was replaced by a Pratt truss footbridge, still in use.
Construction.
In 1826, John Fitzgerald, the wealthy owner of Castle Irwell House (later to become the site of the Manchester Racecourse), built, at his own expense, a 144-foot suspension bridge across the River Irwell between Lower Broughton and Pendleton. According to John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72) all users of the bridge were required to pay a pontage to cross. The bridge was a source of great local pride, as the Menai Suspension Bridge had opened only that year and suspension bridges were then considered the "new wonder of the age".
1831 collapse.
On 12 April 1831, the 60th Rifle Corps carried out an exercise on Kersal Moor under the command of Lieutenant Percy Slingsby Fitzgerald, the son of John Fitzgerald MP and brother of the poet Edward FitzGerald. As a detachment of 74 men returned to barracks in Salford by way of the bridge, the soldiers, who were marching four abreast, felt it begin to vibrate in time with their footsteps. Finding the vibration a pleasant sensation some of them started to whistle a marching tune, and they began to "humour it by the manner in which they stepped", causing the bridge to vibrate even more. The head of the column had almost reached the Pendleton side when they heard "a sound resembling an irregular discharge of firearms". Immediately, one of the iron columns supporting the suspension chains on the Broughton side of the river fell towards the bridge, carrying with it a large stone from the pier to which it had been bolted. The corner of the bridge, no longer supported, then fell into the river, throwing about 40 of the soldiers into the water or against the chains. As the water was only about two feet (60 cm) deep at that point none of the men were killed, but 20 were injured, including six who suffered severe injuries including broken arms and legs, severe bruising, and contusions to the head.
Cause.
An investigation found that a bolt in one of the stay-chains had snapped at the point where it was attached to the masonry of the ground anchor. There was criticism of the construction method used, as the attachment to the ground anchor relied on one bolt rather than two, and the bolt was found to have been badly forged. A number of other bolts were also bent but had not broken. It emerged that three years previously the distinguished Manchester engineer, Eaton Hodgkinson, had expressed some doubt about the strength of the stay-chains compared with the suspension chains. He had said that they should be rigorously tested, but they were not. It also came to light that some time before the accident one of the cross bolts had started to bend and crack, although it was believed to have been replaced by the time of the accident. The conclusion was that, although the vibration caused by the marching had precipitated the bolt's failure, it would have happened anyway.
Aftermath.
The collapse of the bridge caused something of a loss of confidence in suspension bridges, with one newspaper report at the time commenting:
This did not stop the building of more suspension bridges, and the main consequence of the collapse was that the British Army issued the order to "break step" when soldiers were crossing a bridge. French soldiers were also ordered to break step on bridgesnevertheless, marching was cited as a contributing factor to the collapse of the Angers Bridge in France during a storm in 1850 when over 200 soldiers were killed.
Broughton Suspension Bridge was rebuilt and strengthened, but, according to the "Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72)", it was propped with temporary piles whenever a large crowd was expected. The suspension bridge was replaced by a Pratt-truss footbridge, which was formally opened on 2 April 1924. It was designed by the borough engineer and cost about £2,300. The superstructure weighs about 91 tons.

Dulafid dynasty

The Dulafid or Dolafid dynasty was an Arab dynasty that served as governors of Jibal for the Abbasid caliphs in the 9th century. During the weakening of the authority of the caliphs after 861, their rule in Jibal became increasingly independent of the central government in Samarra. In the last decade of the 9th century, however, they were defeated by the Abbasids who proceeded to reincorporate Jibal into their empire.
History.
The Dulafids belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ejl ibn Lojaym. The family is first mentioned in the early 8th century as traders residing in Kufa, Iraq. There are dubious records that they supported the Abbasid family in its struggles against the Ummayad caliphs. They later moved to the Zagros region, where they resorted to highway robbery. Eventually they adopted a more legitimate lifestyle and settled in Karaj. Over time their holdings around Karaj became extensive, and by the 9th century they possessed large tracts of cultivated land, palaces and fortresses.
The first Dulafid to become governor of Jibal was Abu Dulaf al-Qasim, who was appointed to the position by the caliph Harun al-Rashid. He sided with Harun al-Rashid's successor al-Amin in the civil war against the latter's brother al-Ma'mun, was pardoned after the defeat of al-Amin and retained his post. He maintained good relations with the caliphs until his death in 840. His son and grandsons succeeded him in his position as governor of Jibal.
As Abbasid authority in the peripheral provinces broke down in the middle of the century (the "Anarchy at Samarra"), Jibal under the Dulafids became increasingly independent. Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-Aziz (governor 879-893) played an influential role in the wars between the Abbasids and the Saffarid dynasty of Sistan, generally siding with the former. After his death, however, his sons fought amongst themselves over his holdings, presenting an opportunity to the Abbasids to retake Jibal province. Despite offering a sustained resistance, the Dulafids ultimately lost the province in 897.

George A. Seitz

George A. Seitz was an officer in the United States Navy. He was born March 13, 1897, in Rochester, New York, the son of Albert and Caroline (Dubelbeiss) Seitz. Seitz graduated from the Naval Academy in Anapolis in 1916. He attended graduate school at MIT and organized the transport of material to North Africa during the Allied invasion and occupation. He later commanded the USS Bunker Hill, and helped to save that ship during the worst suicide attack against America before September 11. After the war, Seitz became Commander of the Marshall Islands, with the rank of Commodore. According to US Navy records, he was flown from his Headquarters at Kwajalein, on October 15, 1947 for treatment of a severe case of Bronchial Pneumonia. He died of a "heart ailment" ten days later. He was fifty years old. America detonated two atomic bombs in the Marshall Islands before Commodore Seitz died.

Catholic Institute of Higher Studies

The Catholic Institute of Higher Studies (Institut Catholique d'Etudes Supérieures - ICES) is a small private university located in Vendée region of western France, just 25 minutes from the Atlantic coast.
The main goal of this institute is to achieve academic excellence through an enhancement of the Christian and human dimension in seven areas of study. Founded in 1989, ICES has pioneered a new concept in higher education,invented by the first Director, Hervé GROLLIER, that of the “University School” : halfway between the French Grande École and the traditional state university.
In 1990, under the authority of l'Université Catholique d'Angers, the Catholic Institute of Higher Studies (ICES) was opened in Roche-sur-Yon. After three years of collaboration, the Superior Council of the Catholic University of the West awarded ICES its academic independence in 1993. François Garnier, Bishop of Luçon, became the institutional head of the establishment with the responsibility of maintaining its ecclesiastical membership.
In France, diplomas in broad subject areas such as Biology, Law, History, Languages, etc. are mostly proposed in state-run universities. The prestigious Grandes Ecoles in France are elite schools that have very high standards, selective recruitment, specialized fields of study as well as small groups with individual support and counselling.
ICES proposes state diplomas in broad study areas with pedagogical and educational standards that resemble those of a Grande Ecole.
The school's mission is to create a spirit of cooperation between teaching staff and students in the acquisition of knowledge and to establish a personalised partnership with each individual student in order to help realise his or her professional aim. ICES’ 900 students follow classes, conferences and symposiums given by nationally and internationally renowned professors from France and abroad.
To study abroad in France, the Academic Programs proposed at the ICES are:
Law, History, Languages, French Literature & Classics, Biology & Life Sciences, Chemistry & Physics, Applied Mathematics & Computer Science, Political Science, International Relations & International Careers.

Enrico Castellani

Enrico Castellani (born August 4, 1930), one of Italy's most influential artists, is an Italian 20th century painter associated with the zero movement, Movimento Arte Nucleare and Azimut. Castellani contributed the development of avant-garde art in Europe in the 1950s
and 1960s. Castellani was born in Castelmassa located in North-Eastern Italy. He studied sculpture and painting at Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in 1952 and architecture at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Belgium (1956). He is best known for his "paintings of light" that merge art, space and architecture to transcend the confines of painting. In 1956 Castellani returned to Italy and met artists like Lucio Fontana and Piero Manzoni who were pushing Italian avant-garde art.
His original approach is considered fundamental for the art history of the 20th century, not only in Italy, but also on the international scene; In particular,
Castellani influenced Donald Judd, who saw him as the father of minimalism.
Castellani has exhibited at the most renowned institutions in the world including the MoMA and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York;
Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels and he has represented Italy at the Venice Biennale.
He has had retrospective exhibitions at Pushkin Museum, Moscow, Russia; Kettle's Yard in Cambridge; the Miuccia Prada in Milan; The Modern and Contemporary Civic Gallery in Latina in Trento; and Palazzo Fabroni in Pistoia. Castellani was the 2010 recipient of the Praemium Imperiale for Painting, the first Italian artist ever to receive this honor.
Azimuth.
In 1959, Castellani, Vincenzo Agnetti (1926–81), Agostino Bonalumi (1935-2013) and Piero Manzoni founded the Milan gallery Azimut and the affiliated journal “Azimuth,” organizing international exhibitions and publishing essays that opposed the dominant art movements in Europe at the time.
They wanted to announce that, although they had been involved with the then prominent movements of Abstract Expressionism and Art Informel at the beginning, they were now in a different but still radical place. They discussed the beginnings and the decline of Art informel and put forward a new objective language with the presentation of works by Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana and others.
Angolare Series.
The Angolare (“Angular”) series consists of 12 painted works from 1960-1965 for which Castellani fabricated cornershaped
armatures that impose concave and convex curvatures on the canvas, yielding subtly disorienting perceptual
and spatial effects.
Spazio Ambiente.
Moving beyond the spatially suggestive quality of his Angolare series, Castellani produced his first environment in 1967. Called the Ambiente Bianco
(“White Environment”), the work was a spatially enclosing structure formed by interlocking canvases of geometric and angled shapes. The work was
destroyed following its exhibition. In 1970 Castellani reconstructed the environment, adding a floor and ceiling, and reintroduced it as Spazio Ambiente
(“Environment Space”) in the landmark exhibition “Vitality of the Negative in Italian Art 1960/70” at Rome’s Palazzo delle Esposizioni. Spazio Ambiente
is a 360-degree painting executed in a translucent white acrylic that produces a luminescent and transcendental optical effect. Castellani demonstrates
the power of abstract painting to transform space and encompass the viewer. Together the Angolare works and Spazio Ambiente articulate Castellani’s
determination to produce unprecedented and dynamic spatial experiences while using the traditional canvas.
Process.
Castellani focuses on manipulating the surface configurations of his canvases to alter perceptions of space.
He produces monochromatic pieces rendered dynamic by the action of disturbing elements: nails. Indeed, behind a canvas stretched over a wood frame, Castellani places nails that raise or lower the canvas and so create an interplay of light and shadow.

Convection–diffusion equation

The convection–diffusion equation is a combination of the diffusion and convection (advection) equations, and describes physical phenomena where particles, energy, or other physical quantities are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes: diffusion and convection. Depending on context, the same equation can be called the advection–diffusion equation, drift–diffusion equation, Smoluchowski equation (after Marian Smoluchowski), or (generic) scalar transport equation.

Common simplifications.
In a common situation, the diffusion coefficient is constant, there are no sources or sinks, and the velocity field describes an incompressible flow (i.e., it has zero divergence). Then the formula simplifies to:
In this form, the convection–diffusion equation combines both parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations.
Stationary version.
The stationary convection–diffusion equation describes the steady-state behavior of a convective-diffusive system. In steady-state, formula_8, so the formula is:
Derivation.
The convection–diffusion equation can be derived in a straightforward way from the continuity equation, which states that the rate of change for a scalar quantity in a differential control volume is given by flow and diffusion into and out of that part of the system along with any generation or consumption inside the control volume:
where formula_11 is the total flux and "R" is a net volumetric source for "c". There are two sources of flux in this situation. First, diffusive flux arises due to diffusion. This is typically approximated by Fick's first law:
i.e., the flux of the diffusing material (relative to the bulk motion) in any part of the system is proportional to the local concentration gradient. Second, when there is overall convection or flow, there is an associated flux called advective flux:
The total flux (in a stationary coordinate system) is given by the sum of these two:
Plugging into the continuity equation:
Complex mixing phenomena.
In general, "D", formula_2, and "s" may vary with space and time. In cases in which they depend on concentration as well, the equation becomes nonlinear, giving rise to many distinctive mixing phenomena such as Rayleigh–Bénard convection when formula_2 depends on temperature in the heat transfer formulation and reaction-diffusion pattern formation when "s" depends on concentration in the mass transfer formulation.
Velocity in response to a force.
In some cases, the average velocity field formula_3 exists because of a force; for example, the equation might describe the flow of ions dissolved in a liquid, with an electric field pulling the ions in some direction (as in gel electrophoresis). In this situation, it is usually called the drift-diffusion equation or the Smoluchowski equation, after Marian Smoluchowski who described it in 1915 (not to be confused with the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation or Smoluchowski coagulation equation).
Typically, the average velocity is directly proportional to the applied force, giving the equation:
where formula_20 is the force, and formula_21 characterizes the friction or viscous drag. (The inverse formula_22 is called mobility.)
Derivation of Einstein relation.
When the force is associated with a potential energy formula_23 (see conservative force), a steady-state solution to the above equation (i.e. 0 = "R" = ∂"c"/∂"t") is:
(assuming "D" and formula_21 are constant). In other words, there are more particles where the energy is lower. This concentration profile is expected to agree with the Boltzmann distribution (more precisely, the Gibbs measure). From this assumption, the Einstein relation can be proven: formula_26.
As a stochastic differential equation.
The convection–diffusion equation (with no sources or drains, "R"=0) can be viewed as a stochastic differential equation, describing random motion with diffusivity "D" and bias formula_3. For example, the equation can describe the Brownian motion of a single particle, where the variable "c" describes the probability distribution for the particle to be in a given position at a given time. The reason the equation can be used that way is because there is no mathematical difference between the probability distribution of a single particle, and the concentration profile of a collection of infinitely many particles (as long as the particles do not interact with each other).
The "Langevin equation" describes advection, diffusion, and other phenomena in an explicitly stochastic way. One of the simplest forms of the Langevin equation is when its "noise term" is Gaussian; in this case, the Langevin equation is exactly equivalent to the convection–diffusion equation. However, the Langevin equation is more general.
Numerical solution.
The convection-diffusion equation can only rarely be solved with a pen and paper. More often, computers are used to numerically approximate the solution to the equation, typically using the finite element method. For more details and algorithms see: Numerical solution of the convection–diffusion equation.
Similar equations in other contexts.
The convection–diffusion equation is a relatively simple equation describing flows, or alternatively, describing a stochastically-changing system. Therefore, the same or similar equation arises in many contexts unrelated to flows through space.
where M is the momentum of the fluid (per unit volume) at each point (equal to the density formula_29 multiplied by the velocity v), formula_30 is viscosity, P is fluid pressure, and f is any other body force such as gravity. In this equation, the term on the left-hand side describes the change in momentum at a given point; the first term on the right describes viscosity, which is really the diffusion of momentum; the second term on the right describes the advective flow of momentum; and the last two terms on the right describes the external and internal forces which can act as sources or sinks of momentum.
In semiconductor physics.
In semiconductor physics, this equation is called the drift–diffusion equation. The word "drift" is related to drift current and drift velocity. The equation is normally written:
where
The diffusion coefficient and mobility are related by the Einstein relation as above:
where "k"B is Boltzmann constant and "T" is absolute temperature.
The drift current and diffusion current refer separately to the two terms in the expressions for J, i.e.:

The Day of the Wolves

The Day of the Wolves is a 1971 heist movie starring Richard Egan and directed, written and produced by Ferde Grofe Jr.. It was the first movie to be made on location in the new town of Lake Havasu City, Arizona. This was the last feature film made by actress Martha Hyer.
Synopsis.
Pete Anderson (Richard Egan) is chief of police of a small western town, Wellerton. Anderson has a run-in with the son of a council official (played by Len Travis and John Dennis respectively), who gets him fired. His warnings that the town is vulnerable to a criminal takeover were considered scaremongering.
Meanwhile, a group of thieves is being anonymously summoned to a ghost town in the desert by a criminal mastermind. Each is promised a minimum of $50,000 for participating in a heist, must wear a beard to disguise his appearance, and is blindfolded during the journey, so as not to be aware of the location of the site. The thieves are assigned a number from one to seven (number #1 being the mastermind). They are asked to wear gloves for the duration of the exploit and must not reveal any personal information about themselves, so as not to provide evidence that could lead back to them. 
They are shown a map of Wellerton and told that they will fleece the entire town. The criminals are issued black jumpsuits and submachine guns and use the ghost town to train for the heist. Members of the team will destroy a bridge connecting the town to the main highway, destroy the telephone communications of the town and capture all the police officers.
Anderson hands over the running of Wellerton's police department to his deputy (John Lupton), and seeks the comfort of his wife Maggie (Martha Hyer) and young son Will (Steve Manone). He is considering for the family to leave town, and create a new life for themselves elsewhere. Maggie has reservations about this course of action.
The "wolves" fly to the outskirts of Wellerton, where they overcome a farmer and his wife (played by Percy Helton and local amateur actor Elizabeth Thomas, respectively). They proceed to blow up the bridge that provides access to Wellerton, then cut phone and power to the town. They surprise the new interim police chief and his deputies, locking them in the town jail.
Maggie Anderson tips off Pete that the town is being invaded by criminals. To Maggie's dismay, he drives into town and starts a running gun fight with the wolves, killing wolf #2 (Frankie Randall) and wolf number #3 (Andre Marquis), also injuring wolf #4 (Rick Jason). Anderson is superficially wounded in the fight. 
Wolves numbers #1 (Jan Murray), #5 (Philippines actor Zaldy Zshornack), #6 (Henry Capps) and #7 (Smokey Roberds) escape prematurely back to their plane, with only around half of the loot that they had intended to steal. They take off and parachute to separate locations, shave off their beards and change their clothes, burying the old clothes and parachute. Wolf #6 is shown buying a Greyhound ticket, and heading off into the night.
Back in Wellerton, the region's sheriff (Sean McClory) arrives to collect wolf #4 for interrogation. Meanwhile, the mayor offers Pete Anderson his old job back, whilst admitting that his dismissal was a big mistake on the part of the council. Anderson refuses the offer, to the dismay of the mayor and fellow councillors present.
In hospital, injured wolf #4 is promised the prosecution will "go easy" on him by the sheriff and a detective (Biff Elliot) in exhange for telling all the information he knows about the mastermind and accomplices; but all he is able to tell them is that they had numbers and beards. On the TV, a children's show plays in the background, with a clown amusing the kids. Wolf #4 recognizes the voice of the clown as that of wolf #1. The clown tells the children the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves that's an allegory of the heist they just pulled off. Wolf #4 starts laughing uncontrollably as the bemused sheriff and detective look on. How the story unfolds from there, is left to the imagination of the viewer.
Reception.
"Day of the Wolves" has been generally well received, although reviews, especially more recent ones, often cite the film's low budget as evidenced by a lack of expected production values (in particular, the prosthetic beards used in the production, see below). TV guide describes the film as a "Sporadically interesting heist film".
More recently, the film has achieved minor cult status (see below) with its increasing availability.
Music score.
The soundtrack for "Day of the Wolves" was scored by 1960s music icon Sean Bonniwell, founder of the band The Music Machine. The score and title song are 
frequently cited in reviews as being integral to the appeal of the movie. The music was recorded at Original Sound Studios on Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, California in September 1971, with the little-known LA band "Green" performing together with Bonniwell on vocals. 
The title listing for the score is:
Locations.
"Day of the Wolves" was the first film to be made in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Filming made use of meager town locations, but completely omitted using the semi-completed London Bridge. Interior shots of the wolves hideout were taken at (then) abandoned apartment construction, now "Acoma Apartments" at the intersection of Acoma Avenue and Mesquite Avenue. Other scenes used the old airfield on the island area, and several locations on McCulloch Blvd.
The Farmhouse scenes were shot at a former alfalfa farming area, Planet Ranch, and the ghost town scenes at the old Swansea mining town, both located East of Parker, Arizona. The bridge scenes were filmed at the Bill Williams Bridge, located midway between Parker and Lake Havasu City.
Pickup scenes were filmed several months after principal photography wrapped in or around Los Angeles at Marina Del Rey, Santa Monica, Malibu and LAX.
Notable crew members.
"Day of the Wolves" was the first film for most of the film crew; several of those went onto achieve notable success in the Hollywood film industry:
Use of local amateur actors.
In common with other low budget, regionally-made movies, "Day of the Wolves" used local amateur actors for minor roles in the production working side-by-side with actors belonging to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). This was made possible because Arizona is a Right to work state. 
Local actors were recruited through the Lake Havasu Theater Guild by its president, Floyd Hamilton. Hamilton worked on the film both as a production assistant and on screen in the roles of pilot and chauffeur (he can be seen opening the door of the station wagon for Rick Jason on his arrival at the thieves hideout).
The beards.
A key plot point of the film is that the thieves are asked to grow beards before arriving at the hideout to help mask their identities. Several cast members wore real beards during the production: Smokey Roberds, Frankie Randall, Andre Marquis and Zaldy Zshornack. Other members of the cast playing villain roles (Rick Jason, Jan Murray, and Henry Capps) wore fake beards. By modern filmmaking standards the stage beards appear unconvincing, especially since it is implied in the film narrative that the thieves have grown them within a matter of days/weeks upon receiving Number One's invitation to join the caper.
In some respects the film has become synonymous for the use of stage beards as much as the story: for example, in 2008, the Austin Facial Hair Club held a special showing of "Day of the Wolves" at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema to raise funds to attend the World Beard and Moustache Championships in Anchorage, Alaska.
Distribution.
"Day of the Wolves" was originally made as a negative pickup deal by Ferde Grofe's Balut production company for the (now defunct) US distribution company Goldkey Entertainment as a TV movie for US consumption. It was also shown theatrically in some parts of Europe and the rest of the world. In the US, it was also widely shown in the early 1970s as an inflight movie. In the UK it was shown as a TV movie. Although frequently shown on US television in the 1970s and early 1980s, it's rarely found on TV now probably due to its hitherto uncertain copyright status that has only recently changed (see below). It was available in the 1980s on VHS tape, but has essentially been unobtainable until public domain versions started to become available.
Copyright status of the film and music score.
As with many low budget and/or independent films of the period, the "Day of the Wolves" film was not formally copyrighted through 
the Library of Congress (LOC) when it was made by either Gold Key Entertainment nor Ferde Grofe jr. The film clearly displays the copyright logo (©) with date (1971) in the opening credit sequence and is therefore assumed to be covered by the US the statutory minimum copyright protection for a published but unregistered work created before January 1, 1978 of 28 years. The film has been widely assumed to be in the public domain for much of the past decade, though its status has recently changed (see below). It has been openly downloadable from the Internet for several years from a variety of public domain film sites and has been included in the catalogs of public domain film distributors. 
The music score for "Day of the Wolves" was formally copyrighted by Sean Bonniwell with the Library of Congress in 1971. The title/theme song is copyrighted as a separate work, while the score is copyrighted as a 'collective' work. This copyright would have expired 28 years later in 1999 without renewal, except that Public Law 102- 307, enacted on June 26, 1992, amended the 1976 Copyright Act provided for automatic renewal of the term of copyrights secured between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977 (these will not show up in online searches unless the author has requested a copy of the renewal). Both the title/theme and score are also registered with BMI for live performance royalties management and SoundExchange to collect royalties for Internet performance rights.
In 2009 Ferde Grofe (as Balut Productions) successfully applied to the US copyright office to register copyright control over the film, which was granted in July 2009 under copyright registration: RE0000930779. This copyright covers the motion picture not including the soundtrack (since Bonniwell has a pre-existing 
copyright covering the music score from the film).
Since both the film and the music score of the film are formally copyrighted through the Library of Congress, the film can no longer be considered to be within the public domain (arguably it never was since the music soundtrack was copyrighted since 1971). Accordingly, publicly available online copies of the film on websites such as archive.com and Google Video have now been taken offline.
Cult status.
The film has a small but growing cult status, fueled by a compelling storyline and contemporary rock music score.
A documentary film about the making of "Day of the Wolves" is currently in production. An article in the Fall 2008 edition of MovieMaker Magazine titled "Documenting a Cult Classic" describes Grofe's role in the production.
Influence on other filmmakers.
Reviews of "Day of the Wolves" often cite the similarity of the basic storyline of the film with Quentin Tarantino's debut movie "Reservoir Dogs". In both stories, the criminals are anonymized by the gang leader to prevent repercussions should any one of them get caught: in Day of the Wolves the criminals wear beards and are identified by numbers, and in Reservoir Dogs they are identified by the names of colors. 
However, Tarantino is equally likely to have drawn inspiration from another cult movie, "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three", in which the criminals are also identified by the names of colors.

John Wharlton Bunney

John Wharlton Bunney (20 June 1828 – 23 September 1882) was an English topographical and landscape artist of the nineteenth century.
His father was a merchant captain whom Bunney, as a boy, accompanied on several voyages around the world. Bunney demonstrated a strong talent for drawing and draftsmanship from an early age. The young Bunney became a follower of John Ruskin; he studied under Ruskin at the Working Men's College soon after its founding in 1854, and later worked as a clerk for Smith, Elder & Co., Ruskin's publisher. Bunney was able to give up his clerical job and make his living by his art and art teaching by 1859; Ruskin commissioned him to execute a series of drawings in Italy and Switzerland.
Bunney married Elizabeth Fallon in 1863. The couple settled in Florence; they would have four children. Bunney worked for Ruskin's St. George's Company (later the Guild of St George) in northern Italy for the remainder of his life. In his career there, Bunney produced a noteworthy pictorial record of Italy in his era. Ruskin said that Bunney's work was "so faithful and careful as almost to enable the spectator to imagine himself on the spot." Bunney was a friend of many of the Pre-Raphaelites, especially William Holman Hunt.
From 1870 on, Bunney lived and painted in Venice. In 1876 Ruskin commissioned Bunney to paint a picture that included the entire western facade of St. Mark's Basilica; Bunney worked on this project through "six hundred early-morning sessions" spaced over six years. (Ruskin was campaigning to prevent a renovation of the west front of St. Mark's, and the painting was part of this effort.) One day during this period, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, no admirer of Ruskin (Whistler had bankrupted himself in an 1878 libel suit against Ruskin), reportedly sneaked up behind Bunney as Bunney worked, to stick a note to his back. The note read, "I am totally blind." Bunney, absorbed in his work, remained oblivious to Whistler's prank. The painting now hangs in the Ruskin Gallery in the Millennium Galleries in Sheffield.
After Bunney's death in 1882, Ruskin started a memorial fund to benefit his widow and children.

MHC Krylya Sovetov

MHC Krylya Sovetov (; lit. "Moscow Hockey Club Soviet Wings") was a professional ice hockey team based in Moscow, Russia. The team existed for 2 years after PHC Krylya Sovetov were expelled from the Soviet Wings Sport Palace in 2008 and the owner of the arena created a new team. MHC Krylya Sovetov was reunited with PHC Krylya Sovetov in 2010.
History.
Controversy.
In 2008, the owner of the Soviet Wings Sport Palace, the All-Russia Institute of Light Alloys (VILS) () accused Krylya Sovetov of overdue rent payments. This led to the subsequent eviction of the team. The current team left under president Aleksandr Tretiak's lead, but Krylya's hockey school, junior subsidiary teams, and other infrastructure opted to remain under the effective ownership of VILS. In light of this, VILS created a new team MHC Krylya Sovetov.
MHC Krylya Sovetov's main team did not play in the 2009–10 season since the definitive calendar of games for the 2009–10 season of the Russian Major League only contained PHC Krylya Sovetov in the Western Division. MHC Krylya Sovetov's junior team however played in the newly formed Minor Hockey League.
According to KHL website Alexander Medvedev contacted both the administration of PHC Krylya Sovetov and MHC Krylya Sovetov and the two clubs with the help of KHL will be reunited into a single organization once again after the split in 2008.
The reunited team will play their games in Setun, Moscow, where MHC Krylya Sovetov played their games after the 2008 split. The junior team will play in Dmitrov.

The Little Ranger

The Little Ranger is a 1938 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by Gordon Douglas. It was the 169th short in the "Our Gang" series, and the first produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who purchased the rights to the series from creator Hal Roach.
Plot.
Snubbed by his girlfriend Darla, Alfalfa accepts the invitation of tomboyish Muggsy to attend the local picture show. While watching the adventures of his favorite cowboy star, Alfalfa dreams that he himself is a Wild West sheriff, with his pals Buckwheat and Porky as deputies. Naturally, Darla also figures prominently in Alfalfa's dream, as does his archrival Butch. What happens next determines Alfalfa's destiny when he wakes up from his dream.
Notes.
"The Little Ranger" was the first "Our Gang" entry to be produced at MGM. By 1936, Hal Roach, who had produced the series at his studio since 1922, had wanted to get out of the increasingly less profitable short subjects market and into feature films. While Roach successfully moved Laurel and Hardy into features and began producing several other feature properties such as "Topper", the "Our Gang" feature "General Spanky" was a box office failure and MGM persuaded Roach to keep the series in production as a series of one-reel shorts.
Roach constantly fought with MGM to get distribution for a larger number of feature film releases as the studio's short subject output was reduced to only the "Our Gang" one-reelers. In early 1938, United Artists offered Roach a more lucrative and flexible distribution deal, prompting him to end his deal with MGM. This was done by delivering a final Roach-MGM Laurel and Hardy feature, "Block-Heads", canceling two "All-Star" musical features Roach was contracted to produce for MGM, and selling the entire "Our Gang" unit to MGM.
The "Our Gang" sale - done at MGM's insistence rather than canceling the still-popular and profitable series - included the rights to the name, the contracts for the child actors and writers, and a provision that forbade Roach to produce any "Our Gang"-like films or to reissue the "Our Gang" films he had produced. Then-current "Our Gang" director Gordon Douglas was loaned out for a few months to launch the series at MGM, who would hire George Sidney as the permanent "Our Gang" director.
Hal Roach Studios veterans Hal Law and former part-time director Robert A. McGowan transferred to MGM to write the screenplays for the new "Our Gang" shorts. Robert A. McGowan was the nephew of "Our Gang's" original director and producer Robert F. McGowan, and had directed several 1920s/early 1930s "Our Gang" shorts himself under the pseudonym "Anthony Mack".
"The Little Ranger" was filmed late in June 1938, only a mere six weeks after "Hide and Shriek". In their book "THe Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang", film historians Leonard Maltin and Richard W. Bann stated that "The Little Ranger" was "a fine example of what could have been done with "Our Gang" at their new headquarters". MGM continued producing the 10-minute "Our Gang " shorts until 1944, and many of their subsequent works are seen as lesser entries in the series canon.
This was also the fourth short of five to be made without George "Spanky" McFarland. McFarland had departed from the series when his contract with Roach ended in February 1938, and would return when rehired by MGM in July. Tommy "Butch" Bond, Darwood "Waldo" Kaye, and Sidney "The Woim" Kibrick returned for this short and they would continue for a couple more years on a recurring status. The new "Our Gang" theme song was an instrumental medley of "London Bridge" and "The Farmer in the Dell", and would remain in use until the series ended in 1944.

<doc id="19662248" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19662248" title="Asynchronous method invocation">
Asynchronous method invocation

In (multithreaded) object-oriented programming, asynchronous method invocation (AMI), also known as asynchronous method calls or asynchronous pattern is a design pattern for asynchronous invocation of potentially long-running methods of an object.
It is equivalent to the IOU pattern described in 1996 by Allan Vermeulen.
The event-based asynchronous pattern in .NET Framework and the class in Java use events to solve the same problem. This pattern is a variant of AMI whose implementation carries more overhead, but it is useful for objects representing software components.
In most programming languages a called method is executed synchronously, i.e. in the thread of execution from which it is invoked. If the method needs a long time to completion, e.g. because it is loading data over the internet, the calling thread is blocked until the method has finished. When this is not desired, it is possible to start a "worker thread" and invoke the method from there. In most programming environments this requires many lines of code, especially if care is taken to avoid the overhead that may be caused by creating many threads. AMI solves this problem in that it augments a potentially long-running ("synchronous") object method with an "asynchronous" variant that returns immediately, along with additional methods that make it easy to receive notification of completion, or to wait for completion at a later time.
One common use of AMI is in the active object design pattern. Alternatives are synchronous method invocation and future objects.
An example for an application that may make use of AMI is a web browser that needs to display a web page even before all images are loaded.
Example.
The following example is loosely based on a standard AMI style used in the .NET Framework.
Given a method codice_1, one adds two new methods codice_2 and codice_3:
codice_4
Upon calling codice_2, the client immediately receives an object of type codice_6 (which implements the codice_7 interface), so it can continue the calling thread with unrelated work. In the simplest case, eventually there is no more such work, and the client calls codice_3 (passing the previously received object), which blocks until the method has completed and the result is available. The codice_6 object normally provides at least a method that allows the client to query whether the long-running method has already completed:
codice_10
One can also pass a callback method to codice_2, to be invoked when the long-running method completes. It typically calls codice_3 to obtain the return value of the long-running method. A problem with the callback mechanism is that the callback function is naturally executed in the worker thread (rather than in the original calling thread), which may cause race conditions.
In the .NET Framework documentation, the term event-based asynchronous pattern refers to an alternative API style (available since .NET 2.0) using a method named codice_13 instead of codice_2.
A superficial difference is that in this style the return value of the long-running method is passed directly to the callback method. Much more importantly, the API uses a special mechanism to run the callback method (which resides in an event object of type codice_15) in the same thread in which codice_2 was called. This eliminates the danger of race conditions, making the API easier to use and suitable for software components; on the other hand this implementation of the pattern comes with additional object creation and synchronization overhead.

Richard Nykke

Richard Nykke (Nix; c. 1447–1535) was bishop of Norwich, the last Roman Catholic to hold the post before the Henrician reform. Described as "ultra-conservative", but also "much-respected", he maintained an independent line and was embroiled in conflict until blind and in his last years. He is often called the last Catholic bishop of the diocese, but that title is also claimed by John Hopton, bishop under Mary of England. Norwich at this time was the second-largest conurbation in England, after London.
A hunter of heresy who came by his bishopric under Pope Alexander VI, he was a natural target for Protestant propaganda, and stories about him are sometimes poorly founded. One of the best known is that he said that potential heretics "savoured of the frying pan". As Robert Southey pointed out, this translates a well-known French idiom, "sentir le fagot".
Life.
He became bishop of Norwich in 1501, having previously been made archdeacon of Exeter (1492–1493) and Wells (1494–1500) and canon of Windsor under Henry VII of England. After a fire in 1509, he had wooden roofing in Norwich Cathedral replaced with stone vaulting.
He complained bitterly against the early Tudor use of "praemunire" to limit ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Involved in King's Bench cases, he made his case to William Warham (Archbishop of Canterbury), and denounced James Hobart, Attorney-General for most of the reign of Henry VII.
He clashed with John Skelton, who was vicar of Diss in his diocese, from 1507. It is said that Skelton's hostility to the Dominicans led them to denounce him to Nykke for living with a woman. Skelton, however, became a folkloric character and it is not known how much of various tales about him is factual.
Consistently he attempted to maintain Roman orthodoxy, against Lollards, new theological thinking coming out of Cambridge — he was particularly suspicious of Gonville Hall—and the early Protestant reformers. He expressed anxiety about the distribution of William Tyndale's translation into English of the "New Testament".
The reformer Thomas Bilney was burned as a heretic in Norwich, in 1531. Nicholas Shaxton was another suspected heretic of the same time, a Lutheran sympathizer, and Nykke pressured him into a recantation which saved him.
When Thomas Cranmer was newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1533, Nykke was one of the bishops who found ways to defy his authority. He was "brought to heel" in late 1534.
There is a confused story that in 1534 he ran afoul of Henry VIII, by correspondence with the Vatican. According to the account, he was made the subject of a "praemunire" charge, imprisoned in the Marshalsea, and then pardoned; but this story has been doubted. In a more complex picture, Henry VIII used the legal pressure of a "praemunire" to force an exchange of manors of the Norwich diocese for St Benet's Abbey, which then nominally escaped the Dissolution of the monasteries. The 1911 "Britannica" article on Thomas Bilney says that the bishop's legal problem was proceeding to the execution of Bilney without state authority, and an impending Parliamentary inquiry. There was a charge also of infringing the liberties of the mayor of Thetford, and the bishop apparently was imprisoned. This was a King's Bench matter, and therefore formally distinct from the Cranmer issue. Money Henry extracted as a fine from the bishop went to pay for windows in King's College Chapel.
He is buried in Norwich Cathedral.

Kondut, Western Australia

Kondut is a small town in Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.
The first European to visit and chart the area was the surveyor C Crossland in 1884. He named a nearby well Conduit Well.
The town was originally a railway siding that was constructed in 1913 as part of the Dowerin to Mullewa line.
The townsite was later gazetted in 1917.
The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.

Richmond–Kurrajong railway line

The Kurrajong railway line was a railway line in the distant rural western suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was an extension of the branch off the Main Western line from Blacktown to Richmond and was operated by the New South Wales Government Railways.
Construction.
The construction of the railway between Richmond and Kurrajong did not receive Parliamentary authorisation until 1919, by which time roads were being improved to a standard that did not warrant a railway to bring the produce of the area west of the Hawkesbury River to the Sydney market. From its opening in 1926 until its closure in 1952, it remained a minor branch line.
Lobbying for an extension of the Richmond line to Kurrajong began in 1884, but the high cost of bridging the flood-prone Hawkesbury River and the limited amount of agricultural land available delayed construction.
Finally, political lobbying by local landholders paid off and the first sod was turned on 2 June 1923. Regular passenger trains began running on 8 November 1926, although the Official Opening did not take place for another two weeks.
Route description.
The branch began in the back platform at Richmond and continued across East Market Street on a level crossing which was protected by a station employee with a red flag or red light. It then passed around Richmond Oval, continuing in a north west direction along March Street at the far end of which it left the town centre and entered its own right of way. This dropped through a cutting towards the river on a 1 in 50 grade before making its way across the alluvial soil of the level floodplain. Trains were running to this point by April 1925.
Gravel trains ran from the Nepean Sand and Gravel Siding located just before the line crossed the Old Kurrajong Road. This material was being used in the construction of Sydney Harbour Bridge. 
A very short passenger platform was located on the eastern bank of the river. This opened in 1928 with the misnomer of Nepean Bridge. It was renamed Phillip in 1934. This location was a favourite swimming and picnic spot.
The bridge over the Hawkesbury River for the railway was erected on concrete piers which were an extension of those supporting the adjacent road bridge. Upon leaving the river, the line ascended on a 1 in 36 grade through the western river bank and reached Bells Line of Road which it crossed at a 45° angle and entered North Richmond station. This station had a 200 feet (61 m) long platform with shelter, a goods siding.
Upon leaving the station, the railway continued in a straight alignment, largely through the property of farmers. Being classed as a 'pioneer line', the route was unfenced, the rails second-hand and laid on wooden sleepers with ash ballast. Stopping locations were established between North Richmond and Kurrajong at locations which, in 1928, were named Red Cutting, Kemsleys, Thompsons Ridge, Nurri and Duffys. The line through these locations passed orchards and small farms as it slowly climbed into what is the foothills of the Blue Mountains.
Embankments and cuttings were now a feature of the line as it headed towards its terminus. Kurrajong station was located on a site carved from the side of the ridge on which the village is situated. A concrete slab station building stood on the platform. There was a run-round loop and looped goods siding which served a goods shed and hand crane.
Operations.
The regular passenger train on the railway consisted of a Z20-class tank locomotive hauling two carriages. Just like the Camden line, the train was given the nickname of 'Pansy'. The 7 mile (11.2 km) journey was timed to take between 30 and 35 minutes. Mixed trains were given extra time to allow for the possible need to shunt at North Richmond or the Nepean Gravel siding.
However, trains of up to 5 carriages would run to Kurrajong on public holidays. Phillip station would be well patronised. Bushwalkers would take advantage of the 'halts' between North Richmond and Kurrajong. Often carriages would be detached at Kurrajong, to return on later trains when the patronage was increased. The gravel trains were usually hauled by a D50-class locomotive which could haul 640 tons from the siding.
The speed limit for passenger and mixed was just 20 mph (32 km/h), with a 10 mph (16 km/h) limit along March Street and through the park opposite Richmond station. The gravel trains were limited to 10 mph (16 km/h) and 5 mph (8 km/h) respectively.
Safeworking was by means of Ordinary Train Staff, however it was permissible to operate gravel trains between Richmond and the siding whilst the staff was secured at Kurrajong.
Very little freight was handled on the line beyond Hawkesbury River. It was far more convenient for orchardists to use road freight to the Sydney markets as this gave the opportunity for back loading of fertiliser and other farm requisites.
Whilst the line was initially considered a country branch line, from 10 October 1941 it was brought into the Sydney Metropolitan fare scales. This permitted reduced off-peak returns and child weekend excursions.
Closure.
The closing date was not one with the usual advanced notice. Heavy rain on the weekend of 12 and 13 June 1952, caused the Hawkesbury River to flood and, as was usual with such occurrences, the railway service was suspended. More flooding followed in the following weeks and a bus had been substituted on the Kurrajong side of the river with a floodboat ferrying passengers across the flooded stream. A cutting near the terminus had collapsed and, despite constant efforts, would not stabilise until prolonged dry weather returned.
Consequently, it was announced that in view of the damage to the line and the fact that the line was never a commercial success, the line would not reopen. The usual round of Protest Meetings occurred, but finally, on 17 September 1952, the newly appointed Commissioner for Railways, Reg Winsor, made the official notification. The total annual income of the line was less than the cost of repairs.

Harald Auffarth

Eduard Florus Harald Auffarth (also Auffahrt) (?? – 12 October 1946) Royal House Order of Hohenzollern, Iron Cross, Silver Wound Badge, Hanseatic Cross, was a World War I German fighter ace credited with 29 victories. After the war, he ran an aviation training school that covertly supported establishment of the "Luftwaffe".
Early life.
Eduard Florus Harald Auffarth's date and place of birth are unknown. However, German youths were generally not accepted for military duty before their 18th birthday. Based on Auffarth's service records, this would seem to indicate a birth date at least prior to 1899, with 1896 or earlier more likely. His later award of a Hanseatic Cross from Bremen would indicate his birth in Bremen, Bremerhaven, or the vicinity; the various kingdoms of the German Empire generally awarded medals only to their subjects. (Germany's supreme award, the Prussian "Pour le Merite", was an exception to this rule.
World War I Flying Service.
A typical career for a German fighter pilot of World War I began with service in a ground unit; wounds and awards for bravery (typically an Iron Cross) could lead to approval of requests for aviation training. After training, the new flier usually served in a reconnaissance unit flying two-seated aircraft. Auffarth served in two of these units. He first served in "Feldflieger Abteilung" 27. He then transferred to "Flieger Abteilung Artillerie" 266, which would have entailed the pilot flying while the observer was spotting and correcting artillery fire upon the enemy. Typically, the observer was the senior man in the crew.
Auffarth transferred to flying fighters with Prussian "Jagdstaffel 18" and recorded his first victory with them on 16 September 1917. On the last day of the month, he became an ace. He then transferred to Prussian "Jagdstaffel 29".
He was appointed Staffelführer (commanding officer) on either 11 or 19 November 1917 (depending on source), as an Oberleutnant and would lead the squadron for almost a year. At any rate, he scored his first victory with them on 13 November and would eventually score a quarter of his new squadron's victories, flying a succession of Albatroses, Fokker D.VIIs, and a rare Pfalz D.VIII, all in his personal colour scheme of yellow nose and green fuselage with a stylized eight-pointed comet on the side.
He accumulated victories erratically until his total stood at 13 as of 27 March 1918. Auffarth received the House Order of Hohenzollern on 11 April 1918. He scored again on 17 May 1918. On 28 May 1918, he was wounded in the hand. The wound would keep him off duty until 21 July 1918. The day after his return, he shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a over Loos. When his victory count reached 20 on 3 September 1918, as was customary, he was recommended for the "Pour le Merite". It would not be approved before Kaiser Wilhelm II's abdication.
Auffarth was promoted to command of "Jagdgruppe Nr. 3" on 28 September 1918. His new fighter wing consisted of Jagdstaffel 14, Jagdstaffel 16, and Jagdstaffel 56, as well as Jasta 29. He seemed to fly with the latter, as he continued to credit his victories to Jasta 29. He then had his finest month as a fighter pilot. He downed an Airco DH.9 on 5 October, being downed himself in the process. He scored two victories on 9 October and three each on 14 and 30 October, bringing his total to 29.
Post World War I.
He survived the war despite at least three wounds, which was the minimum required to win the Silver Wound Badge. He established "Fliegerschule" Auffarth (Auffarth's Flying School) in Munster in 1924. This was one of ten flying schools that surreptitiously supported covert military aviation training in Germany in violation of the Treaty of Versailles.The school was closed in 1929, just before Germany began training military pilots deep within Russia.
Auffarth returned to service for World War II. He was stationed in Eschenbach in May 1943 as an "Oberstleutnant" or Lieutenant Colonel. He died there on 12 October 1946.

2008 Race.
Organisers expected more than 12,000 runners to take part in the inaugural race in the London borough of Greenwich on October 5, 2008. But bad weather on the day and tube delays saw just 7252 runners cross the startline. Of those 55% were female and 45% were male.
Event information.
The route started and finished at The O2. Runners then headed along the river towards the Thames Barrier, past Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum, the Royal Artillery Barracks and Greenwich Park. A main stage was located next to the start–finish line and music was played at 16 stages along the route. 
The theory behind the event comes from Dr Costas Karageorghis, associate professor of sport psychology at Brunel University. His research depending on a number of factors.
Official Charity.
Leukaemia Research is a British charitable organisation, established in 1960, dedicated to the fight against Leukaemia, Hodgkin's and other lymphomas and myeloma. More than 24,500 people in the UK are diagnosed with a blood cancer each year. Anyone at any age can be diagnosed with a blood cancer, but it is the main cause of cancer death in the under 35’s.

Afon Clun

The Afon Clun is a long tributary of the River Ely (), in the counties of Cardiff and Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. Its bedrock is predominantly of sandstone. Beginning on the western slope of The Garth () the river is fast-flowing, in clear shallow water with a hard substrate, flowing to the south of Llantrisant and generally west to its confluence with the River Ely at Pontyclun, falling over its course.
The river contains species such as stone loach, lamprey, eel, roach, chub and bullhead, and the Afon Clun valley is home to many species, including dragonflies and damselflies, badger, and the Marsh Fritillary butterfly, as well as the European Protected Species – bats, dormouse, otter and great crested newt. Birds in the area include Bullfinch, Kingfisher, Linnet, Reed bunting, Skylark, and Song thrush.
The valley is at risk of flooding between Cross Inn and Pontyclun and is liable to overflow its northern bank along its one and a half mile (2.5 km) length downstream from the main A4119 (Tonypandy to Cardiff Bay ()) road at Talbot Green, () to Pontyclun, providing a wetland wildlife habitat.
There are many archeological sites close to the course of the river, from the Bronze Age tumuli on The Garth and an Iron Age hill fort at Rhiwsaeson, to the more recent industrial archeology of the coal mines.
Course.
The Afon Clun, a major tributary of the River Ely, drains an area of to the north-west of Cardiff in south Wales. The river's source is on the western slope of The Garth () (elevation ), a mountain of pennant sandstone midway between Cardiff () and Pontypridd, whose eastern slopes feed the River Taf by Taff's Well (). The Garth stands in the north western corner of the City and County of Cardiff (), above the village of Gwaelod y Garth, about seven miles (11 km) north west of Cardiff city centre and a mile (1.6 km) north of Pentyrch. The lower northern slopes of The Garth form the boundary with Rhondda Cynon Taf, about half a mile (800 m) north of the Clun's source. To the east the land falls away sharply from the summit, dropping more than 650 feet (200 m) over a distance of . The drop is less dramatic on the western slopes, the source of the Clun, but the river still falls to by the time it crosses the county boundary into Rhondda Cynon Taf at Rhiwsaeson, just over two miles (3.5 km) from its source. The Clun is fast-flowing, with clear shallow water and a hard substrate (gravel/cobble/pebble).
Near the Dŵr Cymru / Welsh Water water treatment plant at Rhiwsaeson the Afon Clun is fed from the north by Nant Myddlyn, which itself is joined from the east by Nant Dowlais. Nant Myddlyn rises in Tynant, Beddau about one and a half miles (2.5 km) to the north of its confluence with the River Clun, between Beddau and Llantwit Fardre (), and Nant Dowlais rises in Church Village (). Nant Dowlais also has a tributary, which rises on Garth Isaf, two and a quarter miles (3.5 km) from it on the north western slopes of The Garth and about half a mile (800 m) north of the Clun's source. 
Leaving Rhiwsaeson, about a mile (1.5 km) east of Cross Inn, the Clun widens to between about eight (2.5 m) and 12 feet (3.5 m) and slows. Here, where the Clun flows to the south of Cross Inn, as well as along the banks of Nant Dowlais and Nant Myddlyn, evidence of otter activity has been noted. The river flows to the south of the A473 Pontypridd to Bridgend () road (Talbot Green By-Pass), where it is fed from the south by Nant Mwyndy. Nant Mwyndy flows over a bedrock of Carboniferous Limestone, rising in Creigiau and, flowing westwards, immediately north of Groesfaen, passing a small Industrial Estate at Mwyndy, feeding a lake resulting from Victorian opencast iron mining (see "History" below) and turning south to flow past Cefn-y-Parc Cemetery (), Penygawsi, before reaching its confluence with the Afon Clun. Clun then flows beneath the main A4119 (Tonypandy to Cardiff Bay) route about south of the roundabout by Glamorgan Vale Retail Park, Talbot Green. At this point, the river often overflows onto the meadows to the north, providing a wetland wildlife habitat, although drainage of floodplain grasslands, for industrialisation, housing and associated infrastructure has had an impact on wildlife by reducing its available area. To the south, the enclosed woodland of Coed-yr-Hendy follows the river's course for its final half a mile (800 m). The woodland's gentle slope, up from the Clun towards Miskin () and Pontyclun, prevents significant flooding over Afon Clun's southern bank.
After passing Y Pant Comprehensive School and Pontyclun Fire Station, the Clun flows under the bridge built for the Llantrisant to Cowbridge () main road, also known as the A4222, and gives its name to the nearby village, Pontyclun, which translates into English as 'the (river) Clun bridge'. Immediately past the bridge, from its source, is the Afon Clun's confluence with the River Ely, which heads south, east to Miskin, almost encircling Pontyclun, then south on its way to Cardiff, where it flows into Cardiff Bay by Penarth Marina, which flows into the Bristol Channel ().
Ecology.
Average annual rainfall in the area is . 
Bedrock along the river's course is predominantly sandstone.
The Clun's water quality is generally class RE2 or better.
[Note: River Ecosystem Classification (RE) regulations and EU Directives for Bathing Water, Freshwater Fisheries, Dangerous Substances and Urban Waste Water Treatment;
RE1: 'Water of very good quality suitable for all fish species';
RE2: 'Water of good quality suitable for all fish species';
RE3: 'Water of fair quality suitable for high class coarse fish populations';
RE4: 'Water of fair quality suitable for coarse fish populations';
RE5: 'Water of poor quality which is likely to limit coarse fish populations.']
Afon Clun and its tributaries are designated 'salmonid waters and cyprinid waters' by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) under the EC Freshwater Fish Directive (2006/44/EC), which sets physical and chemical water quality objectives to protect fresh water bodies suitable for sustaining fish populations
Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has designated the Afon Clun Valley and Rhiwsaeson Hill as a Site of Important Nature Conservation, which is intended to provide the area with some protection from development. In addition, RCT has designated the undeveloped areas of the southern bank of Afon Clun (from Rhiwsaeson to Coed-yr-Hendy, including Mwyndy) and Efail Isaf, Garth and Nantgarw Western Slopes as Special Landscape Areas (SLAs). (SLAs) are intended to protect the visual qualities of "areas of fine landscape quality", when considering development proposals. Coed-yr-Hendy and Mwyndy consist mainly of "undisturbed" fields and woodlands. The south and west of the Efail Isaf, Garth and Nantgarw Western Slopes area consists of farmland – considered to be a buffer between The Garth and the urban area of Efail Isaf and Church Village. The eastern part is the prominent wooded slopes of the Taf Valley – a backdrop to the Treforest Industrial Estate. SLAs are identified using the Countryside Council for Wales' LANDMAP criteria, considering factors such as prominence, spectacle (dramatic topography and views), unspoilt areas (pre-industrial patterns of land use), remoteness and tranquility, vulnerability and sensitivity to change, and local rarity of landscape.
Diversity.
The Afon Clun and Nant Dowlais contain minnow, stickleback, stone loach, lamprey, and eel. The species European bullhead ("Cottus gobio") were also present, until a pollution incident in 2000 CE (see "Industry" below). In addition, the Clun contains roach and chub.
Among the species in the flood-meadows adjacent to the Afon Clun is the Common orchid. The river's banks contain broadleaf woodland as well as invasive plants such as Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed.
Several species of dragonfly and damselfly hunt on the river. Other species present include bats, badger, dormouse, otter, great crested newt and the Marsh Fritillary butterfly, of which bats, dormouse, otter and great crested newt are European Protected Species. There is evidence that otters use Nant Dowlais and Nant Myddlyn, as well as the Clun and several species of bat have been sighted in the area, including Natterer's, Long-eared, Noctule and Pipistrelle.
The Clun flows through, and close to, several areas defined in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) as 'Areas of Ecological Significance'. Birds of 'conservation concern' recorded in surveys of the area are Bullfinch, Kingfisher, Linnet, Reed bunting Skylark, and Song thrush.
Hedgerows throughout the area qualify for protection, under the Hedgerow Regulations 1997.
Domesticated animals – horses and sheep – are kept in many of the fields bordering the river. Farmers have been encouraged to fence off access to the river for their animals, to prevent erosion of the riverbank and to prevent organophosphates (and the alternative synthetic pyrethoids) used in sheep dip, from contaminating the river.
Industry.
Two companies in the area around the Afon Clun valley are regulated by a system known as Integrated Pollution Control (IPC). They are Nipa Laboratories, at Llantwit Fardre, who operate processes involving the manufacture and use of organic chemicals, and Maxibrite, who produce smokeless fuels at Mwyndy, using carbonisation processes. IPC attempts to minimise the impact of industrial processes on the environment. Coal Products, who produced foundry coke at the Cwm Coke Works at Tynant, Beddau, were also regulated by IPC until the works closed in 2002. Under IPC the Environment Agency ensure that: "in carrying out a prescribed process the operator shall use BATNEEC (Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost) for:
i) preventing the release of substances prescribed for any environmental medium or, where that is not practicable by such means, for reducing the release of such substances to a minimum and for rendering harmless any such substances which are so released; and
ii) for rendering harmless any other substances which might cause harm if released into any environmental medium."
Since the end of coal mining in south Wales, the Afon Clun gradually returned to the condition in which it was before the Industrial Revolution, although it has been polluted several times since then. In 2000 CE ammonia discharged into Mwyndy Brook killed over 600 fish and eels, including the complete resident population of a conservation species known as bullheads, and many hundreds of small coarse fish fry, in the Clun. The coal briquetting plant that caused the pollution were fined a total of GBP31,816 in fines and costs, after a prosecution brought by the Environment Agency. Nant Myddlyn, a tributary on the Clun, suffered from a diesel spill near Llantwit Fardre, in early 2008 CE, which was raised at the Senedd.
Between 1994 and 1996, water quality at Nant Myddlyn, from Tynant to the confluence with the Nant Dowlais, was noted as RE5; at Afon Clun, from the confluence with the Myddlyn to Rhiwsaeson village, the quality was RE4. The deterioration of water quality was caused by the discharge of industrial effluent from Cwm Coke Works at Tynant. An effective effluent treatment plant was recommissioned to solve the discharge problem and water quality soon returned to RE2, until the works' closure in 2002 CE. 
Since Coal Products' Cwm Coking Works closed, water abstraction from the Afon Clun area is minimal. The Works at Tynant had used up to 3.9 million litres per day (Ml/d) from Nant Myddlyn and a borehole and occasionally, water abstraction at the Works had caused Nant Myddlyn to dry up.
Floodplain.
Upstream, the river is characterised by its steep slopes and shallow soils. Around 18% of the catchment area is defined as urban and, as the area has a relatively high rainfall, the combination produces a catchment that responds rapidly to rainfall and has flooding problems throughout. Further flooding problems occur at its confluence when the river levels in the River Ely are high.
Areas of flat land next to waterways are attractive to developers. Parts of the floodplain between Cross Inn and Pontyclun have been developed over the last 20 years, reducing the area available for the river to overflow. The A473 (Cross Inn to Lanelay road) Talbot Green by-pass, Glamorgan Vale Retail Park, Leekes department store, Y Pant School, Ynysddu Farm housing estate and the houses along the former Pant y Dderwyn meadow have all been built where the river water used to go when its banks could no longer contain the volume. Some earthen banks (the pre-existing flood defence) are incorporated in the gardens of the Ynysddu estate. Y Pant school was constructed on the floodplain against the advice of the then Glamorgan River Board.
The authorities now consider the floodplain as an integral part of the overall river system. Under the Environment Agency's Floodplain Policy, it is deemed essential that it is kept free from development for flood defence reasons. The Clun is liable to overflow its northern bank along its one and a half mile (2.5 km) length downstream, between Cross Inn from the main A4119 (Tonypandy to Cardiff Bay ()) road at Talbot Green, () and Pontyclun. This floodplain provides a wetland wildlife habitat. In addition, horses are kept in the meadows, when the ground is not too waterlogged.
History.
From the end of the last ice age (between 10,000 and 12,000 BP), mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. They would have been able to walk between Continental Europe and Great Britain on dry land, prior to the post glacial rise in sea level, up until between 6,000 and 7,000 BP. As the area was heavily wooded and movement would have been restricted, it is likely that people also came to what was to become known as Wales by boat from the Iberian Peninsula. These neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, who gradually changed from being hunter-gatherers to settled farmers. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land.
In common with the people living all over Great Britain, over the following centuries the people living in what is now known as the Afon Clun valley assimilated new immigrants and exchanged ideas of the Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Together with the approximate areas now known as Brecknockshire, Monmouthshire and the rest of Glamorgan, the Afon Clun Valley was settled by a Celtic British tribe called the Silures.
Bronze Age.
There is a group of five round barrows, near the river's source at the top of The Garth, thought to be Bronze Age, one of which supports a trig. pillar on its flat top. 
Iron Age.
Overlooking the Clun at Rhiwsaeson, Caerau hillfort is an oval Iron Age enclosure, measuring (east—west) by . Dating from 700 BCE, it is one of the largest known hill forts in south Wales. The defences comprise a set of two banks and ditches, with a counterscarp bank. Originally, the bank stood approximately 25 feet (7.5 m) high, though much of it has been destroyed, and only of the north east (the best preserved) part remain. Where the hillside below is steepest, to the south, there are no outer stone defences, though the inner ramparts continue to the cliff edge. The entrance to the fort, at the south west, is approximately 25 feet (7.5 m) wide, between parallel in-turned banks about long. 
Caerau Hillfort was the subject of a forgery in a book called 'Gwentian Brut' In "The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales", edited by JONES, O.; WILLIAMS, E.; PUGHE, W.O. (1801). The forgery was fabricated by Edward Williams (a.k.a. Iolo Morgannwg) while he was one of editors of "Myvyrian Archaiology", suggesting that Caerau Hillfort was the site of the "Battle of Rhiwsaeson" in 873 CE.
Tudor iron making.
Lead mines were opened in Mwyndy (between Llantrisant and Groesfaen) in the "Parke of Cloune" in May 1531 CE. By August 1531 CE iron ore was being mined there. Iron smelting began nearby during the summer of 1532 CE, with one bloomery furnace site at Mwyndy, and (probably) another smaller smelting site at Rhiwsaeson, employing 4 blowers/hewars, with three blowers operating the bellows at any one time. They produced up to 2 blooms, of 50 kg per bloom per day, from 150 kg of ore, taking 6 to 7 hours each to produce. Charcoal to heat the furnaces was probably derived locally, from "Cloune Park" — mention is made by Rice Lewis in his 'A breviat of Glamorgan' (1595 and 1600 CE) of the destruction of the forests of Garth Maelog and Allt Griffith because of the ironworks. The iron mines were leased by the crown in 1539 CE, granting rights to mine and make iron and to build water powered iron works within three miles of Cloune Park for 21 years. There is no evidence to suggest that either iron mining or smelting continued in the area after the 16th century. 
It is likely that the name of the house built on or near the ironworks derived from the words mwynglawdd (), and dy (soft mutation from ty) (). And from that, the area name of Mwyndy.
The mine was either reopened, or dug out near the original workings, about 1859. Over one million tons of iron ore (goethite) were mined at Mwyndy before the mine closed in 1884. The resuling lake feeds into Nant Mwyndy.
Coal.
The Afon Clun marks the southern edge of the South Wales Coalfield. There are several former collieries to the north of the river. Many pits were begun in the 1860s in Beddau, Ty'n-y-nant and Gelynog pits being the most important, prior to which the area was mostly farmland. Cwm Colliery was sunk by the Great Western Colliery Company Limited in 1909 and this marked a rapid expansion of the population. In 1923 the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company sunk the Ynysmaerdy Colliery at Llantrisant, also known as the New Duffryn and Llantrisant Colliery, it had three shafts, employing 216 men. The Cwm was acquired by Powell Duffryn in 1928. In 1931 an underground railway linked the Cwm to the Maritime Colliery, Pontypridd and by 1934 the Cwm employed 100 men on the surface and 780 men underground. A methane gas explosion on bank holiday Monday, 2 June 1941, killed four men — Ernest Evans (Banksman), Noah Fletcher (Winding Engineman), John Gregor (Manager), and David Thomas (Switchboard Attendant) — and destroyed most of the surface buildings. The explosion would have caused far greater loss of life had it not occurred on a bank holiday. The colliery never reopened after the accident.
The mines were nationalised in 1947 and in 1957 another underground railway linked the Cwm with Coedely Colliery, north of Llantrisant. The merger of these two pits created the largest colliery in the south Wales coalfield. At the peak of production in 1960, the Cwm Colliery employed 1,470 men and produced 324,794 tons of coal. British Coal closed Cwm Colliery in 1986, a year after the Miners' Strike.
Ffordd-y-Bryniau.
Ffordd-y-Bryniau is a ridgeway walk through Taff-Ely (), beginning at Mynydd Maendy (SS977861), Bridgend in the west, and ending at Caerphilly mountain () (ST153856), in the east. The route passes through Llantrisant Forest, Llantrisant Town and Caerau Hillfort, only dropping from the ridgeway at the Ely Valley and Nant Myddlyn. The Waymark is a yellow/black named disc, with a hills motif. 
The route links with the Ogwr Ridgeway Walk, which joins the Coed Morgannwg Way, the Taff Trail near Taffs Well and the Rhymney Valley Ridgeway Walk at Caerphilly Mountain.
Future developments.
Improvements to the road network, in particular the A4119 linking the Rhondda Valleys to the M4, through Tonyrefail and Talbot Green, brought development pressure to the area around Llantrisant. Extensive housing development has taken place recently in the villages along the A473, the main Pontypridd to Bridgend road, linking Llantwit Fardre to Llantrisant, Talbot Green, Llanharan and Pencoed, the road that runs parallel to the Afon Clun from Rhiwsaeson to Pontyclun. This development brought further pressure on the road system, which led to the revival of the 1989 plans for the Church Village bypass. Preparatory work on the bypass began in February 2008, and an announcement was made on 12 March 2008 that the Welsh Assembly Government had given the go-ahead for work to start in the "next few months".
An Environmental Constraints Plan has been compiled and updated from ecological surveys of 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007, with a view to minimising the impact of the bypass scheme. Findings from the surveys show the presence of Bat, Badger, Dormouse, Otter, Great Crested Newt and the Marsh Fritillary Butterfly.
Leading on from the Church Village Bypass scheme, is a proposal to dual the existing A473 Talbot Green Bypass, between the Church Village Bypass and the former headquarters of the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service (who moved to Llantrisant in 2009) at Lanelay Hall. The scheme is "highly dependent on the level of development activity in the area" however, and Rhondda Cynon Taf's Strategic Site 7: Mwyndy/Talbot Green Area, in particular.
A single track railway runs north from Pontyclun station, turning west at Talbot Green to run roughly parallel to the Clun, alongside the north of the A473. At Cross Inn the track turns north east, running north of the Caerau Hillfort, and originally ran to the Cwm Coking Works at Tynant, Beddau, although the track has been dismantled to the east of Cross Inn. All the original railway paraphernalia remains intact between Talbot Green and Pontyclun, including the track, signals and bridges with cages above the track to prevent people throwing things (or themselves) onto the trains, tracks or coal wagons. The track is still embedded in the road where it crosses the A473, the warning lights remain at the roadside and the roadsigns warn drivers to stop if they see warning lights flash at the level crossing. A recent consultative study (Sewta Rail Strategy Study—January 2006) has considered the possibility of reopening the Pontyclun to Beddau branch line, as a passenger line rather than just for freight. This would require new stations at Talbot Green, Llantrisant, Gwaun Meisgyn and Beddau (Tynant).

Chris Durno

Christopher Scott Durno (born October 31, 1980) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who is currently playing with Sportverein Ritten-Renon of the Italian Serie A. He has previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Colorado Avalanche.
Playing career.
Undrafted, Durno spent four years playing collegiate hockey with Michigan Tech. After turning pro, Durno spent time in the ECHL with the Gwinnett Gladiators and the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL). After being invited to the Chicago Blackhawks training camp for the start of the 2006–07 season, Durno was signed on September 25, 2006, and assigned to the affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals.
On December 28, 2006, Durno was traded along with Sébastien Caron and Matt Keith to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Bruno St. Jacques and P. A. Parenteau. Durno's tenure with the Ducks only lasted one month before he was traded to the Nashville Predators for Shane Endicott on January 26, 2007. The Predators then sent Durno to their affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, and in result became just the third player to represent both Norfolk and Milwaukee Admirals in the same season.
Durno spent the 2007–08 season with the San Antonio Rampage of the AHL. On July 3, 2008, Durno signed as a free agent with the Colorado Avalanche to a one-year deal. He started the 2008–09 season with the Lake Erie Monsters and received his first ever NHL callup on December 30, 2008, however did not play a game. On January 18, 2009, Durno was re-called again for the Avalanche, and made his NHL debut in a 6–2 win over the Calgary Flames.
Moving back and forth between the Avs and the Monsters for much of the first half of the 2009–10 campaign, Durno finally scored his first NHL goal on December 26, 2009, against Alex Auld of the Dallas Stars in front of a sold out crowd at the Pepsi Center, a game the Avalanche won 4–1.
On July 25, 2010, Durno signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He failed to debut with the Lightning during the 2010–11 season, playing as captain in his return to the AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals.
Durno signed a one-year contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 15, 2011, and was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers. On October 6, 2011, he was named as an alternate captain for the team. With injury limiting Durno's effectiveness, he suffered a downturn in scoring to post just 5 goals in 53 games during the 2011–12 season with the Checkers.
Once again a free agent in the off-season, Durno's effort for a new contract was hampered by the 2012–13 NHL lockout. Midway into the 2012–13 season, Durno was signed to his first European contract with Italian club, Sport Ritten-Renon, on November 20, 2012.
Prior to pursuing a career as a professional hockey player, Durno played lacrosse for the Toronto Beaches, where he earned enough recognition for his services that he was drafted by the Toronto Rock in the 5th round (64th overall) 2001 NLL Entry Draft.

Candy (Malaysian band)

Candy is an all-female Malaysian rock band formed in 1996. They were entered into the Malaysian Book of Records as the first all-women band in Malaysia.
Candy found fame with their first album "Candy" which went Platinum, when the hit single "Akan Ku Tunggu" was released in 1997.
Candy is made up of Patricia Robert (lead vocals and guitar), Mary Morss (lead guitar and vocals), Cornie Sangid (drums, percussion and vocals) and Nancy Graggory (bass guitar and vocals).
History.
Pre-Candy years (1988-1996).
In 1988, in her hometown of Kuching, band founder Mary, persuaded her younger sister, Cornie, to bring together a group of friends to form a band. The original lineup consisted of Mary Morss (guitars and vocals), Cornie Sangid (drums), Magdalen Julita Thomas (bass guitar), Veronica Ng (vocals) and Marilyn Ryne (vocals). They called themselves The Sapphire Gals.
Though essentially they were an all-girl band they were joined by keyboardist Rodney Hughes who was the only male member of the band. Rodney left in 1989 and for a while the band was without a keyboardist. Marilyn Ryne and Veronica also left the band around this time and Meggry Graggory took over the vocal duties.
In 1990, keyboardist Yolanda Entika joined the band.They changed their band name to D'Rozza . Around the same time, Magdalene Julita left and was replaced by Nancy Graggory, who is the older sister of Meggry. Cornie, split her time between playing drums in the band and recording a solo Iban album.
In 1992 Casaphia Studio took them under its wing, and the band changed its name to G-Saphia. The “G” stood for “Girls”. Keyboardist Danita Ng joined the band for a short stint. Within the same year, her younger sister Janice took over from her but even Janice did not stay long and left before the year was over. Around this time, Meggry also left the band and was replaced by Patricia Robert who was an Iban recording artist and a singer in the Sarawak State Ministry of Social Development and Urbanization.
In 1994 keyboardist Ophelia June joined G-Saphia. Ophelia is the younger sister of Rodney Hughes.
The band, under the names of Sapphire Gals and G-Saphia, performed in private and public functions around Kuching, and also in other towns in Sarawak. The functions included events such as the Malaysia National Day celebration and Malaysia Police Day.
Candy (1996-present).
In 1996 Ophelia June left the band, and the 4 remaining members left their hometown of Kuching and moved to Kuala Lumpur to record their first album. The band also changed their name to Candy.
Candy (now made up of Mary Morss, Cornie Sangid, Nancy Graggory and Patricia Robert) relocated to Kuala Lumpur in 1996. Patricia Robert took up the second guitarist role and continues to be the lead singer. Under the guidance of producer Edrie Hashim Candy spent 1996 recording their first album "Candy", and released it in 1997. The single “Akan Ku Tunggu” became a hit.
In 1998 Candy recorded their second album "Hot" with producer Mat Noh Hendrix at the helm. Mat Noh was chosen for his experience in performing, recording and producing in a heavy metal band - he was a member of the heavy metal band Rusty Blade. Unlike in the first album Patricia Robert did not do all the lead vocals. Nancy sang lead vocals in the tracks "Warisan", "Emansipasi", "Puas Hatiku" and "Taufan Yang Kecewa", while "Resah" had Cornie singing the lead vocals. Singer Royce Sa'yan sang the backing vocals in the song "Emansipasi". The album also contained a cover of the Iron Maiden instrumental piece "Transylvania".
Nancy Graggory left Candy in 1999, citing personal reasons. Jacqueline Chong was roped in to do the bass duties. Jacqueline played bass during Candy's live shows from 1999 to 2004 but never recorded an album with them.
In 2004 Jacqueline Chong left Candy to pursue her studies and Nancy Gregory rejoined the band.
Current projects.
In October 2008 Candy completed the recording of their third studio album called Candy:Absolute. The release date has not been announced yet.

Tour of the Universe (tour)

Tour of the Universe was a 2009/2010 worldwide concert tour by English electronic band Depeche Mode in support of the group's 12th studio album, "Sounds of the Universe", which was released in April 2009.
The Live Nation-produced tour, which was announced in October 2008 in Berlin, kicked off with a warm-up show in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg in May 2009. By the end of the year, the tour had reached Europe, Asia, North America and South America.
The concerts in Barcelona, Spain were filmed for the video release "", which was released on 8 November 2010 in Europe and 9 November 2010 in North America on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.
Overview.
The tour commenced in May 2009 with a warm-up show in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, followed by the first full-fledged date in Tel Aviv, Israel. The tour was disrupted as lead singer Dave Gahan was struck by a severe bout of gastroenteritis, which occurred before the band were to take to the stage in Athens. Following subsequent cancellations of eight further shows, the tour was eventually confirmed to recommence in June while Gahan reportedly flew to the United States for treatment; a low-grade malignant tumour in his bladder was found and successfully removed. Although a portion of the cancelled dates were rescheduled, the band's appearance at the Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands was pulled, while all remaining dates and one of two dates in Leipzig, Germany were cancelled indefinitely due to "scheduling conflicts".
In June 2009, the band played their first show following Gahan's illness in Leipzig, resuming a European leg which eventually wrapped up in Bilbao, Spain. The tour was cut short after Gahan tore a calf muscle, forcing the cancellation of two dates in Porto, Portugal and Seville, Spain respectively.
In July 2009, the group began a tour of the U.S. and Canada. The leg, which featured a headline slot at the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago, started in Toronto and culminated in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in early September. In August, two dates in California were cancelled after Gahan received doctor's orders to serve a period of complete vocal rest.
In October 2009, the band returned to North America to play four dates in Mexico. The leg continued on to Costa Rica and South America, their first shows in these territories since the Exotic Tour in 1994. The group received attention in the media following the group's performance in Peru after it was reported that Gahan thanked the wrong country. According to reports, Gahan said: "Thank you very much, Chile" towards the end of the concert held in Lima. However, this claim was later disputed by a band representative, who quoted Gahan as saying: "Thank you very much, good night" instead. The leg eventually finished up in Buenos Aires. Later in the month, the act began a European leg of indoor venues, which kicked off in Oberhausen, Germany and culminated mid-December in Manchester, United Kingdom.
In January 2010, the group commenced a third European leg in Berlin. The leg included five shows that were rescheduled following Gahan's illness in the summer of 2009. The tour also included a date as part of a series of concerts in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust, which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. During this concert, the performances of "Home", "One Caress" and "Come Back" were accompanied by a seven-piece string section. Additionally, during the encore, former band member Alan Wilder made a surprise appearance onstage, accompanying Martin Gore's performance of "Somebody" on piano. It was the first time Wilder had performed with the band in more than fifteen years, having exited the group in 1995. Speaking about the event, Wilder said that he was "happy to accept" Gahan's proposal to join the group onstage and stated that " were long overdue some kind of reunion of this sort". The entire tour eventually wrapped up in Düsseldorf, Germany in late February, after ten months and 102 shows in 32 countries. In total, the band performed to more than 2.7 million people. As reported by music industry publication Billboard, the tour was one of the most profitable in 2009, ending 20th in the magazine's "Top Tours" list.
Similar to the group's previous tour, Touring the Angel, recordings of some of the tour's concerts were made available on double CD format or as a digital download under the generic name "Recording the Universe". A video release of the live concerts held at Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain, titled "Tour of the Universe : Barcelona 20/21.11.09", was released on 8 November 2010 in Europe and 9 November 2010 in North America on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The DVD release was issued in two formats, "Deluxe" and "Super Deluxe", which both include two audio CDs of the live concerts. The "Super Deluxe" edition also includes a second DVD featuring the tour documentary, "Inside the Universe", as well as extra bonus materials.

List of Muppets

The Muppets are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson and now owned by The Walt Disney Company (namely at their entertainment branch called The Muppets Studio). The characters became a household name after their appearance in the children's television program "Sesame Street". Henson was initially reluctant to become involved with "Sesame Street" because he feared being pigeon-holed as a children's performer, but agreed to work on the show to further his social goals. The first Muppet characters appeared as early as 1955, in "Sam and Friends", a Washington, D.C.-based show that was on the air for six years. Kermit the Frog was one of the show's regulars, and thus was one of Henson's first Muppet creations.
By the early 1970s, Henson began to think seriously about the possibility of a network series for adults featuring the Muppets. The characters appeared on the comedy sketch show "Saturday Night Live" (namely "The Land of Gorch" segments) in 1975, and by 1976, "The Muppet Show" (which was produced in London) began to air in syndication. Jim Henson and his associates created additional characters for subsequent projects which included television shows, movies, commercials, and programs for the Internet.

Party Fever

Party Fever is a 1938 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by George Sidney. It was the 170th "Our Gang" short (171st episode, 82nd talking short, 83rd talking episode, and second MGM produced episode) that was released.
Plot.
Once again, Alfalfa and Butch are bitter rivals for the affections of Darla. The nerdish Waldo comes up with a solution: Alfalfa and Butch will compete for the title of Junior Mayor of Greenpoint during Boys' Week, and whichever one wins will earn the honor of escorting Darla to the annual Strawberry Festival. But despite the strenuous efforts of both young candidates, a "dark horse" wins not only the election, but also the girl.
Notes.
Like The Little Ranger, Party Fever was a well produced film and it was the first episode to be directed by up and coming director, George Sidney. 
This was also the fifth episode to be made without George McFarland as Spanky. He was still on loan to other studios and would stay on loan for another couple weeks. It was also the last episode in which Pete the Pup would appear. MGM's producers felt that it was time to retire him and to so called "modernize" the series.

Wilhelm Baehrens

Wilhelm Baehrens (3 September 1885 – 23 January 1929) was a German classical scholar.
The son of professor Emil Baehrens (1848–1888), Wilhelm Baehrens was born in Groningen. After visiting the local gymnasium he stepped in his early deceased father's footsteps by studying philology and papyrology at the University of Groningen. He also stayed few semesters at Halle, Göttingen and Berlin. In 1910 Baehrens received his doctor's degree at Groningen with his dissertation "Panegyricorum latinorum editionis novae praefatio maior accedit Plinii panegyricus". For two years he acted as assistant schoolmaster at the Groningen gymnasium, until in 1912 he published his "Beiträge zur lateinischen Syntax". In 1913 the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities entrusted him with the publication of the Latin homilies by Origen. The next three years Baehrens travelled to Italy, France and Germany collating manuscripts. The University of Groningen therefore awarded him "venia legendi" in 1915 and in 1916 Baehrens was appointed ordinary professor at the University of Ghent by the German occupation government in Belgium.
After the loss of Germany in World War I and the termination of the German occupation of Belgium, Baehrens was expelled from Ghent as a collaborator in 1919. Because of the Halle professor Georg Wissowa, he habilitated there in May 1919 and was appointed professor-extraordinary in 1920. In 1922 he was appointed ordinary professor at the University of Göttingen, where he worked until his death in 1929. His edition of the works of Origen was published from 1920 to 1925; another edition of Fulgentius' works was not completed.

<doc id="19662836" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19662836" title="Akimoto Lake">
Akimoto Lake

Akimoto Lake (秋元湖) is a lake that is technically classified as a reservoir. It straddles the border of the village of Kitashiobara and the town of Inawashiro, both in the Yama district of Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Along with Hibara Lake and Onogawa Lake, it forms what is known as the "Inner Bandai Plateau Tri-Lake Formation".
Overview.
The lake itself did not exist as late as the Meiji period in the area now known as the "Inner Bandai Plateau", which was once the site of the village of Hibara. In 1888, Mount Bandai--which is located to the south—erupted, and part of the mountainside caved in as a result of the accompanying phreatic explosion; a large rockslide—and then mudslide—in the direction of Hibara destroyed the village. It was previously assumed that one large phreatic explosion had occurred, but the destruction of the mountain is now thought to have been caused by several medium-sized explosions.
Rivers like the Nagase River and Onogawa River that flow in the Inner Bandai area became clogged up due to the destruction of the mountain and mudslide; Lake Hibara, Lake Onogawa, Goshiki Marsh and other such dammed lakes were thus formed. Akimoto Lake was formed by the damming of Ōkura River and Nakatsu River. It is the deepest of the lakes in the inner Bandai tri-lake area, and is second to Lake Hibara in surface area.
Akimoto Lake’s water flows in from Nagase River, and forms a delta at its lower section which pours into Lake Inawashiro. Water then flows from Lake Inawashiro into Nippashi River, from which it connects to Agano River at Kitakata City. Because of this path that the water takes, Akimoto Lake is designated under the River Act as part of the Agano River water system, and managed as a class-1 water system by Fukushima Prefecture.
Tourism.
Akimoto Lake, along with Lake Hibara, Lake Onogawa, Goshiki Marsh and others are designated as part of Bandai-Asahi National Park, a major tourist destination in the Aizu region. Particularly noteworthy are the changing colors of the fall leaves, which reflect vividly on the water surface. Caution is necessary as visitors flock to the area in the fall and cause traffic jams along Route 459, which leads to the Inner Bandai tri-lake area. The sun rising over Akimoto Lake is a favorite subject of photographers, and many come in the morning to get shots of the scenery in the morning light.
Boating is permitted on Akimoto Lake. Boats can be rented on a time limit. Fishing is permitted, but numbers of the smallmouth bass--an invasive fish—have been increasing in recent years, drawing bass fishing lovers as well as the ire of the local fishing co-op, which sees the species as posing a threat to local aquatic insects and indigenous fish. There is a bicycling road on the shore of Akimoto Lake, and it is possible to venture out to the Nakatsu ravine on the upper reaches of the Nakatsu River. The lake also has a camping ground, and is popular as a general outdoor spot.
Akimoto Lake is accessible by taking the Ban-etsu Expressway or the Inawashiro-Bandai Highland Interchange to Route 115, and then transferring to Route 459, turning right at Goshiki Marsh Entrance and heading straight. Coming from Mount Adatara, take Route 115 and make a right at the Takamori intersection, going straight on Fukushima Prefectural Road 70—the Fukushima-Azuma-Inner Bandai line—and then transfer to the Bandai-Azuma Lake Line. Coming from this direction, you can view the upper reaches of Akimoto Lake. To access the lake via public transportation, take JR East's Ban-etsu West Line to Inawashiro Station or Kitakata Station and board the Bandai Toto Bus headed for Inner Bandai, get off at Akimoto Lake Entrance, and then proceed on foot.
Hydroelectricity production.
The Agano River water system that Akimoto Lake is a part of has an ample amount of water and flows quickly, making it an ideal spot for the generation of hydroelectricity. In 1889, the first hydroelectricity production on the Agano River water system began with the opening of the Numagami Hydroelectric Plant, which operated via the Asaka Aqueduct.
Later, in the Taishō period, the Inawashiro Hydroelectric Energy Company began full-scale hydroelectricity production on Lake Inawashiro and Nippashi River, and in 1914 boasted what was at the time the largest hydroelectric plant in Japan—Inawashiro Electric Plant #1—successfully completing an overhead high-tension power transmission line that sent electricity to Tokyo. Inawashiro Electric Plant #2 (in 1918) and #3 (in 1926) were later constructed, furthering development of Lake Inawashiro and the Nippashi River.
The Inner Bandai tri-lake area drew attention due to its abundance of water, and in 1923 plans were made for further hydroelectricity generation on Onogawa Lake and Akimoto Lake. The Onogawa Power Plant was completed on Akimoto Lake in 1937, with an output of 34,200 kW made possible by utilizing a tunnel to move water from Onogawa Lake. Construction was later begun on Akimoto Lake, but the wartime Energy Management Act of 1939 was enacted, essentially forcing all electric companies to assimilate with Japan Electric Generation and Transmission Company. Construction under the Japan Electric Generation and Transmission Company proceeded, and Akimoto Power Plant was completed in 1940. In order to generate an effective supply of energy, plans called for an earth dam, increasing the storage capacity of the lake. When the dam was completed, Akimoto Power Plant boasted a permitted output of 107,500 kW, which at the time was the highest on the Agano River water system.
After the war, Japan Electric Generation and Transmission was designated to be broken up under the Economic Decentralization Act, and in 1951 was split into 9 smaller electric companies. The hydroelectric plants around Lake Inawashiro were placed under the management of Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc., where they remain today. Tokyo Electric Power Company has adjusted the water level of Akimoto Lake in compliance with requests from Fukushima Prefecture.
Multi-purpose dam.
In August 1989, the Inner Bandai area experienced heavy torrential rains. The water level at Akimoto Lake, as well as Lake Onogawa and Lake Hibara, had rapidly risen, and the entire river basin sustained major damage. Akimoto Lake has a drainage pumping station at the center of the dam that is used to discharge excess lake water, but the torrential rains outpaced the station's ability to pump water, making it impossible to regulate the water level properly. More water than could be handled under water use regulations was being discharged, and the Nagase River eventually flooded, causing even more damage to the surrounding region.
Fukushima Prefecture, shaken by how quickly the river overflowed, drew up new flood prevention plans for the Inner Bandai tri-lake area. Because of the nearby Bandai-Asahi National Park, environmental protection concerns prevented the construction of levees or dikes. It was decided that a multi-purpose dam would be built to facilitate unspecified water utilization, flood control for Lake Hibara, Lake Onogawa and Akimoto Lake, as well as a normal stream level for the Nagase River; work began at the Inner Bandai tri-lake area in 1997 under the Comprehensive River Development Project.
The practice of damming natural lakes for flood prevention and water usage is performed nationwide, with some of the more prominent examples being Lake Biwa, the Seta River Wash Weir, Lake Kasumigaura and the Hitachi River floodgate, which are all under direct control of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and others like Lake Chūzenji/Chūzenji Dam in Tochigi Prefecture and Yogo Lake/Yogo Dam in Shiga Prefecture, which are controlled at the prefectural level. Natural lakes in Fukushima Prefecture that are dammed include Lake Inawashiro and the Jyūryoku Bridge floodgate. Lake Hibara now features a 3.4 meter-high gravity dam, Lake Onogawa has a 4.9 meter-high fill dam, and Akimoto Lake—in addition to its earth dam—now has a gravity dam with an emergency floodgate on its left bank, making it a combined dam. Facilities such as dams, weirs and flood gates enable flood prevention and water usage for natural lakes and marshes, and can be referred to as "water level regulation facilities." While places like Akimoto Lake are in fact lakes, they are classified as dams under river-related regulations.
Due to the fact that each is less than 15 meters in height, they are technically classified as weirs under river law, but they provide valuable service in the form of flood prevention and hydroelectricity generation among the Nagase River, Akimoto Lake and the other Inner Bandai tri-lake area lakes. Work was completed on the secondary dam in 1999, and control over regulation of water levels that had been performed by Tokyo Electric Power Company was thereafter done directly by Fukushima Prefecture's Inawashiro office of civil engineering.

Paddle steamer Genève

The Genève is the oldest steam paddle ship of Leman Lake. 
"Genève" was built in 1896 by Sulzer for the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman. She was launched for the Swiss national exhibition in Geneva.
"Genève" was the theater of the death of Elisabeth of Bavaria on 10 September 1898. The wounded Empress, who had been stabbed, boarded the ship, where her condition was seen to be life-threatening, and "Genève" turned around to return her to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage, where she died shortly afterwards.
On 3 May 1928, near Pully, "Genève" collided with the "Rhône". The left anchor of "Genève" became entangled into the rigging of the "Rhône", breaking her bowsprit and her figurehead, and snapping the top of the fore-mast. A passenger was killed by a falling piece of the fore-mast.
In 1934, "Genève" went under a refit, where her steam machinery was replaced with diesel engines. She was the first CGN ship to be converted to diesel.
In 1973, "Genève" was taken out of commission and sold for scrap. The next year, she was purchased by an "Association pour le Bateau "Genève"" for 75 000 CHF, and moored at Eaux-Vives dock. She ship is now unserviceable, but still afloat.
The name "Genève" was taken by a CGN swift boat on 31 October 2007.

Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler

Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler (d. before 1226) was an Anglo-Norman heiress and the wife of Fulk FitzWarin, a medieval landed gentleman who was forced to become an outlaw in the early 13th century. Part of the legend of Robin Hood might be based on him.
By her first marriage to Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler, Maud was the ancestress of the Butler Earls of Ormond.
Family.
Maud le Vavasour was the daughter of Robert le Vavasour, deputy sheriff of Lancashire (1150–1227), and his first wife, an unnamed daughter of Adam de Birkin. She had a half-brother, Sir John le Vavasour who married Alice Cockfield, by whom he had issue. Maud's paternal grandfather was William le Vavasour, Lord of Hazlewood, and Justiciar of England. Her maternal grandfather was Adam fitz Peter of Birkin.
Maud was heiress to properties in Edlington, Yorkshire and Narborough in Leicestershire.
She is a matrilineal ancestor of Anne Boleyn, Queen of England and second wife to King Henry VIII of England.
Marriages and issue.
In or shortly before 1200, Maud married her first husband Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler (died February 1206), son of Hervey Walter and Maud de Valoignes, and went to live in Ireland. His brother Hubert Walter was Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1185, Theobald had been granted land by Prince John, who was then Lord of Ireland. He was appointed Butler of Ireland in 1192, and High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1194.
Theobald and Maud had three children:
Following the death of Theobald in early February 1206, Maud returned to England into the custody of her father, who, having bought the right of marrying her at the price of 1200 marks and two palfreys, gave her in marriage by October 1207, to Fulk FitzWarin. Fulk was the son of Fulk FitzWarin and Hawise de Dinan, who subsequent to a violent quarrel with King John of England, was deprived of his lands and property by the vengeful king. Fulk then sought refuge in the woods and became an outlaw, with Maud having accompanied him. The legendary figures of Robin Hood and Maid Marian are said to be based on Fulk and Maud.
Maud died in 1226 and Fulke III married again to Clarice D'Auberville.
By FitzWarin, Maud had two sons and three daughters
Fulk IV
Fulk Glas
Hawise, wife of William Pantulf
Joanna
Mabel
In fiction.
Maud is the main protagonist in Elizabeth Chadwick's "Lords of The White Castle", which relates in fictional form, her life and adventures as the wife of Fulk FitzWarin.

Ozark Air Lines Flight 650

Ozark Air Lines Flight 650 was a regularly scheduled flight from Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls Regional Airport in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. While landing on runway 3 in a snow storm on December 20, 1983, it struck a snow plow on the runway. The impact ripped the right wing from the plane destroying the snow plow and killing its driver. The leaking fuel from the wing briefly created a fireball that engulfed the airplane. The plane spun through 180° before coming to rest off the runway to the left of the center line. Passenger evacuation was initiated through the front two doors. No passengers were injured in the evacuation but two flight attendants suffered minor injuries.
The resulting NTSB investigation determined that the snow removal operations were controlled from the tower. The snow plow, call sign Sweeper 7, had been routinely directed to exit the runway to accommodate arrivals and departures. When flight 650 was handed off from approach control to the tower it did not initiate contact with the tower. The tower controller eventually contacted the flight and cleared it to land. No communications had been made between the tower and Sweeper 7 after flight 650 was handed off to the tower controller. Neither the approach or tower controller had advised flight 650 that snow removal operations were in progress. The hourly ATIS broadcast advised that blowing snow conditions were present. The crew was not concerned on landing that snow was observed blowing on the runway. Shortly after touchdown when they entered the snow cloud the plane struck the snow plow. The board concluded the snow removal operations were inadequately supervised by the tower.
The aircraft involved in the accident was eventually returned to service with a replacement right wing salvaged from Air Canada Flight 797 that had been destroyed by fire after an emergency landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport earlier that year. The aircraft was acquired by Republic Airlines and flew with Northwest Airlines after their merger until it was retired in 2006.

Colle Caruno

Colle Caruno is a frazione (outlying area) of the Commune of Teramo in the Abruzzo Region of Italy. It is located about four miles from the communal capital. In times past the village has been referred to in documents as "Colacaruni" or "Collecaruni". These names likely derive from a certain Cola (Niccola) Caruni, buried in a graveyard in Teramo. 
Colle Caruno falls under the bishopric of Teramo. In 1123 one large feud existed made up of Colle Caruno along with Gesso (today Villa Gesso), Castagneto, and Pozo Rotari (likely today's Poggio Rattieri). It was administered by the Totoneschi family.
Historians pint to the existence of the Chiesa di San Giacaomo (Church of Saint James) as far back as 1271. In 1804 the area in and around Colle Coruno was reported to have 19 inhabitants falling under the jurisdiction of Teramo, 26 inhabitants under the jurisdiction of Montorio al Vomano, and 27 inhabitants under the jurisdiction of Bisegno. During the Napoleonic era in the early 18900's the village was included in what was then referred to as the "Circondario di Teramo" (Teramo Provincial Holdings). In 1813 the area, along with Forcella and Magnanella con Gesso, was officially placed within the commune of Teramo.

Taurisci

The Taurisci were a federation of Gallic tribes who dwelt in today's northern Slovenia (Carniola) before the coming of the Romans (c. 200 BC) According to Pliny the Elder, they are the same people known as the Norici. The denotation probably stems from Celtic "taur" meaning "mountain", as in Tauern, and therefore may also refer to highlanders in general.
Affiliated with the Celto-Ligurian Taurini, the Taurisci settled on the upper Sava river after their defeat at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC. In the wake of the Boii they migrated to northern Italia and the Adriatic coast. The Greek chronicler Polybius (ca. 203–120 BC) mentioned Tauriscian gold mining in the area of Aquileia. With the troops of the Roman Republic they were defeated by invading Germanic Cimbri and Teutons at the Battle of Noreia in 112 BC.
The identity of Taurisci and Norici has not yet been conclusively established: According to historian Géza Alföldy, the Norici were one tribe of the larger highlandic Taurisci federation, while the "Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde" defines the Norici as Celts settling in the "Regnum Noricum" in present-day Carinthia with the Taurisci as their southeastern neighbours. Other people settling in the region were the Pannonians in the south-east of Carniola, in the south-west lived the Iapydes, an Illyrian tribe, and the Carni, a Venetic tribe.

Inveresk and York Park Precinct, Launceston

The Inveresk and York Park Precinct in Launceston, Tasmania, once Tasmania's largest industrial site, is now the major cultural heart of the town. It is home to Aurora Stadium, one of two current Australian Football League venues in Tasmania, the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, TAFE Tasmania, and The School of Visual and Performing Arts. The annual Royal Launceston Show is held every October at the Inveresk Showgrounds. Invermay Park and other minor facilities are located behind Aurora Stadium and near to the Inveresk Showgrounds. The precinct is also home to the Annexe Theatre, one of Tasmania's leading venues and home of CentrStage Theatre.
York Park is a sports ground located in the Inveresk and York Park Precinct, Launceston, Australia, and is the largest capacity stadium in Tasmania, holding 20,000. Since 2004, it has been known as Aurora Stadium, under a six-year naming-rights sponsorship deal with Aurora Energy. Primarily used for Australian rules football, its record attendance was 20,971, when Hawthorn played Richmond in an AFL match in June 2006.
York Park.
York Park is a sports ground located in the Inveresk and York Park Precinct, Launceston, Australia. It has the highest capacity of any stadium in Tasmania, holding 20,000. Since 2004, it has been known as Aurora Stadium under a six-year naming rights agreement with Aurora Energy. Primarily used for Australian rules football, its record attendance, 20,971, was set in June 2006 when Hawthorn played Richmond in an Australian Football League (AFL) match in June 2006. 
York Park has been used as an international sports venue since 2001. Beforehand, only North Launceston and state football games were played. The area was originally swampland before becoming Launceston's showgrounds in 1873. Work started on transforming the area into a sports venue in 1919 and was completed within two years.
Australian rules football has been played at York Park since 1923, with other sports such as cricket, tennis, bowling, cycling and foot-racing also staged. Since 2001, the Hawthorn Football Club has played between two and five AFL matches a year at the ground, and the St Kilda Football Club played two games a year from 2003 to 2006. The Tasmanian Government has a A$16.4-million, five-year sponsorship deal with Hawthorn, meaning that four home and away season games and one National Australia Bank Cup pre-season match will be played at the venue each year. On 21 February 2009 the ground became home of the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame. Throughout its history, York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments. A redevelopment at a cost of $23.6 million was completed in 2005.
Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.
The Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery (QVMAG) has a part of the museum located at the Inveresk Precinct. Its other site is at Royal Park and when combined it becomes the largest museum in Australia located out of a capital city.
It includes a working planetarium and displays related to Launceston's industrial environments and railway workshops.
Inveresk Showgrounds.
Every October the Royal Launceston Show is held at the Inveresk Showgrounds. The show runs for three days, starting on a Thursday (Which is a public holiday in Northern Tasmania) and ending on Sunday. The Royal Launceston Show is principally an agricultural event which focuses on the primary industries of Tasmania, and rural lifestyle of many Tasmanians with events such as livestock judging, equestrian events, animal breeders competitions, produce competitions and wood chopping, although it also incorporates live entertainment, sporting events, food tasting, and fashion shows. A popular feature of the show is the sideshows which feature showrides, foodstalls, games of skill, and showbag stalls.
The MS fest has been held annually since 2006. The festival started at Launceston's Regatta Ground to mark the 50th anniversary of the MS society, and it was a big success with all tickets being sold. In 2007 the event was moved the Inveresk Showgrounds to accommodate a larger crowd and even with a larger capacity it was again a sellout. During 2008, a record crowd of 11,000 watched acts such as; Hilltop Hoods, Sneaky Sound System and Kisschasy. The event will again return on Saturday 7 February 2009.
Australian Technical College.
A new Australian Technical College campus has been constructed at the Inveresk site at a cost of around $7.5 million.
Past proposed projects.
In 1998 a $25 million hotel and convention centre was proposed for Inveresk. Plans indicated that the 100 to 150 room hotel would be at least four stars and worth about $15 million, and in a separate building next door would be a 500-seat convention centre.

Abruzzo regional election, 2008

A regional election took place on 14–15 December 2008 in Abruzzo, due to the early resignation (the last election was held in 2005) of President Ottaviano Del Turco, after his indictment for alleged corruption. The election was to take place on 30 November–1 December but was postponed because of legal issues over the ammission of the list of For the Common Good.
The candidate of The People of Freedom (PdL) was Gianni Chiodi, a former mayor of Teramo. The PdL rejected any alliance with the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC) and The Right in order to strengthen its goal of becoming a majority force free from the blackmails of small "old politics" parties.
On the centre-left, local and national leaders of Democratic Party (PD) tried to produce a joint candidate with Italy of Values (IdV) and UDC, but IdV said that an alliance with the PD was possible only if the PD would have supported their own candidate, Carlo Constantini. IdV was even tempted by running a solitary campaign: Abruzzo was in fact a stronghold for the party, whose leader Antonio Di Pietro comes from neighbouring Molise. However, in late October, the PD agreed to support Costantini at the head of a large centre-left coalition, comprising also the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), the Party of Italian Communists (PdCI), the Federation of the Greens and the Socialist Party (PS).
The PD tried to woo also the UDC in the centre-left coalition, but the UDC refused any alliance with populist IdV and decided to run its own candidate, Rodolfo De Laurentiis. Teodoro Buontempo was the candidate of The Right.
On election day Gianni Chiodi defeated Carlo Costantini. The election was a major defeat for the PD, while IdV had a very good result, despite the poor showing of its candidate, who won less votes than its supporting parties.

Osamu Shimomura

Biography.
Born in Fukuchiyama, Kyoto in 1928, Shimomura was brought up in Manchukuo (Manchuria, China) and Osaka, Japan while his father served as an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army. Later, his family moved to Isahaya, Nagasaki, 15 miles from the epicenter of the August 1945 atomic bombing of the city. He recalls hearing, as a 16-year-old boy, the bomber plane before the atom bomb exploded. The explosion flash blinded Shimomura for about thirty seconds, and he was later drenched by the "black rain" bomb fallout. He overcame great odds in the following 11 years to earn an education and achieve academic success.
Shimomura's education opportunities were starkly limited in devastated, post-war Japan. Although he later recalled having no interest in the subject, he enrolled in the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Nagasaki Medical College (now Nagasaki University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences). The Medical College campus had been entirely destroyed by the atomic bomb blast, forcing the pharmacy school to relocate to a temporary campus near Shimomura's home. This proximity was the fortuitous reason he embarked upon the studies and career which would ultimately lead to unanticipated rewards. Shimomura was awarded a BS degree in pharmacy in 1951, and he stayed on as a lab assistant through 1955. 
Shimomura's mentor at Nagasaki helped him find employment as an assistant to Professor Yoshimasa Hirata at Nagoya University in 1956. While working for Professor Hirata, he received a MS degree in organic chemistry in 1958 and, before leaving Japan for an appointment at Princeton University, a Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1960 at Nagoya University. At Nagoya, Hirata assigned Shimomura the challenging task of determining what made the crushed remains of a type of crustacean (Jp. "umi-hotaru", lit. "sea-firefly", "Vargula hilgendorfii") glow when moistened with water. This assignment led Shimomura to the successful identification of the protein causing the phenomenon, and he published the preliminary findings in the "Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan" in a paper titled "Crystalline Cypridina luciferin." The article caught the attention of Professor Frank Johnson at Princeton University, and Johnson successfully recruited Shimomura to work with him in 1960.
Study.
Shimomura worked in the Department of Biology at Princeton for Professor Johnson to study the jellyfish "Aequorea victoria", which they collected during many summers at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington. In 1962, their work culminated in the discovery of the proteins aequorin and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the small, mouse-sized umbrella-shaped jellyfish "Aequorea victoria"; for this work, he was awarded a third of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008.
Family.
His wife, Akemi, whom Shimomura met at Nagasaki University, is also an organic chemist and a partner in his research activities. Their son, Tsutomu Shimomura, is a computer security expert who was involved in the arrest of Kevin Mitnick. Their daughter, Sachi Shimomura, is director of Undergraduate Studies for the English Department at Virginia Commonwealth University and the author of "Odd Bodies and Visible Ends in Medieval Literature".

South Coast A-League Bid

South Coast Football is a New South Wales community based group bidding to enter a team in the Hyundai A-League for the 2010-11 season. The bid, led by local businessman Eddy De Gabriele, aims to represent a population of 500,000 in the South Coast, New South Wales region, taking in the Wollongong, Shellharbour, Shoalhaven, Wollondilly, Wingecarribee, Kiama and Eurobodalla local government areas.
The area has a strong football history, containing some of the oldest clubs in Australia. While there are more than 12,000 registered players from juniors to seniors it is also the home of Australian internationals such as Johnny Warren, Scott Chipperfield, Mile Sterjovski and Luke Wilkshire. The captain of the 1974 FIFA World Cup team, Peter Wilson, played in the area after emigrating from England. Wilson still lives near Wollongong. Tim Cahill has declared his support for the South Coast bid and will launch his first coaching academy in Wollongong. 
A bid was entered to join the 2009–10 A-League but lost out to Gold Coast United and North Queensland Fury. The A-League was expected to expand further into a 12 or 14 team competition for 2010–11 and the South Coast bid 
was considered a front runner to join the expansion, but in 2011 FFA announced that it is going to consolidate and strengthen the current clubs so there will be no expansion for the foreseeable future. 
The bid had its genesis in a decision by Wollongong City Council to pursue an A-League place in 2006. A key success so far has been the unification of nine separate football organisations in the region, the first time they have come together under one banner for more than 30 years. This includes the support of Wollongong Wolves, or Wollongong FC as they are now known, who won the National Soccer League titles in 2000 and 2001
Memberships.
South Coast Football was expected to launch a membership drive in late 2008 to demonstrate the level of commitment to A-League football in the community. More than 6,000 fans turned up to the club's touted home ground of WIN Stadium, Wollongong to watch a 2008 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup match between Sydney FC and Wellington Phoenix. One of their main rivals for the twelfth A-League place, Canberra, drew 8,000 to a similar match.

Martin Chalfie

Martin Lee Chalfie (born January 15, 1947) is an American scientist. He is University Professor at Columbia University, where he is also chair of the department of biological sciences. He shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Osamu Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien "for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP". He holds a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Harvard University.
Biography.
Chalfie grew up in Chicago, Illinois, son of the guitarist Eli Chalfie (1910—1996) and owner of an apparel store Vivian Chalfie (née Friedlen, 1913—2005). His maternal grandfather, Meyer L. Friedlen, immigrated to Chicago from Moscow at an early age; his paternal grandparents, Benjamin and Esther Chalfie, came to Cincinnati from Brest-Litovsk.
He matriculated at Harvard University in 1965, intending to be a math major, but he switched to biochemistry because it combined his interests in chemistry, math, and biology. He spent the summer after his junior year working in the laboratory of Klaus Weber at Harvard, but "It was so disheartening to completely fail that I decided I shouldn’t be in biology." As a result, in his senior year, he completed his major and took courses in law, theater, and Russian literature. 
He also competed on the swim team at Harvard and was named captain in his senior year. At the time, swimming coach Bill Brooks said, "Marty will make an excellent captain because he has the admiration of the entire team."
As captain, he won the Harold S. Ulen trophy, awarded "to a senior on the Harvard team who best demonstrates those qualities of leadership, sportsmanship, and team cooperation as exemplified by Harold S. Ulen." Following the announcement of Chalfie's Nobel award, his freshman-year roommate observed of Chalfie, “He would always identify himself as a swimmer.”
After graduating in 1969, he worked at a variety of temporary jobs, such as selling dresses for his parents' dress manufacturing business in Chicago and teaching at Hamden Hall Country Day School in Hamden, Connecticut. In the summer of 1971, his research at the laboratory of Jose Zadunaisky at Yale University resulted in his first publication. With revived confidence, he returned to Harvard for graduate studies under Robert Perlman, and received his Ph.D. in 1977. 
He conducted his postdoctoral research at the LMB with Sidney Brenner and John Sulston, and the three published a paper in 1985 on "The Neural Circuit for Touch Sensitivity in "C. elegans"". Chalfie then left the LMB in 1982 to join the faculty of Columbia University in the department of biological sciences and continued to study "C. elegans" touch mutants.
He married Tulle Hazelrigg. She later joined him on the faculty of Columbia University. She gave him permission to cite her unpublished research in his seminal Science paper "Green Fluorescent Protein as a Marker for Gene Expression" on condition that he made coffee, cooked, and emptied the garbage nightly for a month.
Chalfie and his wife had a daughter, Sarah, in July 1992.
Chalfie was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2004.

Imago Scientific Instruments was a company founded in 1999 by Dr. Tom Kelly. At that time he was the Director of the Materials Science Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left his tenured position in 2001 to guide the company's growth. 
Imago commercialized the Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP), providing a new type of atom probe microscope which is literally orders of magnitude faster in many performance criteria than any other recently delivered atom probe microscope. Imago (name comes from the Latin word for image or picture) has not only improved the instrumentation available for atom probe tomography, but has also developed many sample preparation techniques that are key enablers for the 3D sub-nanometer compositional information that the microscope provides. 
In April 2010 Imago was purchased by Ametek which is also the parent of CAMECA. The company was merged with CAMECA as part of Ametek's Materials Analysis Division.

Toorama

Toorama (, alternative name in ) is a music group from Saransk, Mordovia in Russia, performing traditional songs and music of Mordvin ethnic groups, namely Erzya, Moksha, Shoksha, and Qaratay.
History.
Created in 1990 by 4 researchers of Mordvin language and traditions across the USSR, Toorama was originally a choir of 9 men. Eventually, Vladimir Romashkin, a researcher and documentary film maker, emerged as the group's frontman. Eager to communicate in Russian and Erzya with audience, he made extensive introductions into every song and dance tune, traditions and rituals of Mordvin peoples, that became integral parts of each performance. 
The ensemble enjoyed popularity both locally (receiving the State Prize of the Republic) and on Moscow level (receiving in 1994 the Gold Medal and the Grand Prix of All-Russian Traditional Music Contest "Voices of Russia"), as well as in Finno-Ugric cultural events in Finland, Estonia etc. Its Finno-Ugric ties eventually brought forward the Latinized spelling of the group's name via "oo" for long "o" instead of single "o" used in its Russian name Torama. 
The group appeared at traditional music and jazz+traditional music festivals in Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Sweden, and UK. 
After several years, their repertoire evolved to include a richer instrumental part, made possible with reconstruction of extinct Mordvin instruments such as garzi violin. In 2002, the instrumental compositions became an important part of each performance and evolved into a separate direction of the group's activity. 
In 2002, Vladimir Romashkin died. In his memory, a memorial museum was opened in his native village of Podlesnaya Tavla. 
The group, while dropping its activity rate for several years, remained and continued its work, staying the standalone Mordvin traditional ensemble with the longest discography. 
In 2007, a new animated movie Kuigorozh (upon a Mordvin tale) by Pilot Animation Studio in Moscow was released, making use of extensive consultations on Erzya and Moksha folklore with group's management and the group's music as a soundtrack.
Cultural contribution.
Polyphonic singing.
Finno-Ugric singing tradition is most often described as bivocal, with 2 vocal lines developed in a choir. Toorama musicians insisted on development of a melodic line for each member, as 2 melodic lines were thought to be a simplification of actual tradition. 
Instrumental performance.
While choir singing is widely represented across villages of Mordvins and in Saransk, the living instrumental ensemble performance was practically extinct to the point when Toorama started its reconstruction work and developed the instruments anew.

Live at the Lower Manhattan Ocean Club

Live at the Lower Manhattan Ocean Club is a live album by David Murray. It was originally released as two volumes on the India Navigation label in 1978 and re-released in 1989 on a single CD (with a slightly edited final track). It features a live performance by Murray, Lester Bowie, Fred Hopkins and Phillip Wilson recorded in concert at the Lower Manhattan Ocean Club, NYC.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating "This double CD, which packages together the two original LPs, captures David Murray's quartet (trumpeter Lester Bowie, bassist Fred Hopkins and drummer Phillip Wilson) in high spirits. The six selections (four are over ten minutes and "For Walter Norris" exceeds 21) are full of spirit, looseness, humor, screams and screeches. Some of it rambles on too long (and Murray's soprano on "Bechet's Bounce" is quite silly) but it generally holds on to one's attention.".

The Cizek Model One

The Cizek Model One was the first HIFI product of CIZEK Audio System, a two-way bookshelf loudspeaker system which gave a certain notoriety to Roy Cizek, founder of the company. 
This product was important because it was the first loudspeaker system which, due to its particular crossover, showed a flat impedance curve (except for the resonance peak) with a consequent easier work for the amplifier and linear frequency response.
Another peculiarity of the Cizek One was a switch that permitted selection of the Q factor of the bass frequencies; thus, the listener could choose a more or less controlled bass depending on the kind of music or ambient acoustic characteristics. The Cizek Model One became the most successful product of the Company since 1976, first year of production.

Tommy Battle

Thomas M. "Tommy" Battle, Jr. (born December 3, 1955) is the mayor of Huntsville, Alabama. His term began November 3, 2008.
Battle served one term on the Huntsville City Council from 1984-1988. He made an unsuccessful run for mayor in 1988. Battle moved to Huntsville in 1980 to operate Britling's Buffet, which he sold in 1989. Battle owns or is managing partner in several firms in the retail and real estate sectors. He is married to Eula Battle and has one adult son, Drew. Battle is a graduate of the University of Alabama, from which he holds a B.S. degree in business.
Battle announced his candidacy against incumbent Mayor Loretta Spencer on March 26, 2008. In his campaign, he sharply attacked Spencer on several issues. Among these were cost overruns and delays on a city jail constructed in Spencer's term; the city's controversial involvement in the relocation of a downtown rescue mission into a residential neighborhood; and what Battle claimed was inequitable treatment of some city neighborhoods, particularly minority areas. Prior to the first round of voting, Spencer was endorsed by "The Huntsville Times". The Committee of 100, a prominent group of business leaders, issued a joint endorsement of Battle and Spencer.
In the municipal election on August 26, 2008, Spencer led Battle by 14,871 votes to 14,486. However, two minor candidates received 673 votes, preventing Spencer from attaining a majority, forcing a runoff with Battle. During the runoff campaign, Battle sharpened his attacks on Spencer, and pointed to a "bridge to nowhere". The bridge in question was constructed by the city, and ended at an undeveloped empty lot. Spencer claimed the lot was expected to be developed at some point in the future. In the runoff, on October 7, 2008, Battle decisively defeated Spencer, by a vote of 21,123 votes or 56 percent for Battle, to 16,821 or 44 percent for Spencer.
In August 2012, Battle was elected to a second four-year term with 80.7% of the vote, defeating Jackie Reed (4.1%) and former mayor Loretta Spencer (15.2%).

Air Belgium

Air Belgium was a charter airline that operated from Brussels, Belgium, in the 1980s and 1990s. The airline flew international services on jet aircraft.
History.
In May 1979, the tour operator Sun International, the charter airline Abelag AVIATION and HERFURTH combined as one company. They began flight operations with leased aircraft, a Boeing 707 and a Boeing 737-200, flying out from Brussels to destinations around the Mediterranean.
The following year, in 1980 after the withdrawal of one of their business partners, the company was renamed AIR BELGIUM, in the hope that the company would receive more passengers from neighbouring countries. 
The original livery of Air Belgium's later B757 / B737-400 / B737-300 aircraft consisted of black AIR BELGIUM titles and yellow and red striping (on the white upper and side fuselage / tail) , Black-Yellow-Red being the colours of Belgium's national flag.
In 1998, Air Belgium was sold to Airtours. By the end of October 2000, Air Belgium had ceased all flight operations.
Goals.
In 1990, in addition to European/Mediterranean destinations, destinations such as Fort Lauderdale, the United States and Mexico were made possible. From November 1991, flights to Palma de Mallorca were added. Soon after, scheduled flights were chartered to locations such as Alicante, Faro, Funchal, Malaga, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Tenerife.

Gary Crowley

Gary Crowley (born 8 October 1961) is an English broadcaster and DJ.
When he was at school (Rutherford School, Penfold Street, Marylebone, London) in the late Seventies Crowley started a punk fanzine titled "The Modern World", interviewing some of the most important bands of the day including the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Jam.
After leaving school he took up a junior position at the Decca record label. A short time later he moved jobs to take over from Danny Baker as the telephone receptionist for the "NME" at their offices in Carnaby Street. At the time the weekly music paper was at the very centre of the punk explosion under the editorship of Neil Spencer and featured writers such as Julie Burchill, Tony Parsons and Nick Kent.
Crowley's next employment was with Clive Banks' independent plugging and publishing company and through connections there he was offered a job as a DJ on London's independent commercial station Capital Radio. At the age of 19 he became UK radio's youngest DJ.
TV presenting soon followed, with a Saturday morning children's show on ITV called "Fun Factory" and as the presenter for the "Runaround" spin-off "Poparound" which ran in 1985 and 1986.
His TV career continued through the Nineties with the popular 'post-pub' music show "The Beat" ran on ITV from 1991–94 and in 2008 Gary Crowley presented on Rockworld TV.
Crowley's DJ broadcasting career began with his Capital Radio break and continued with an influential show called "Magic Box" on BBC Radio London.
In 1997 Crowley left what was then Greater London Radio to join up as the star presenter on London's first indie station XFM, the product of a team including "NME" journalist Steve Lamacq, programme controller Sammy Jacobs, record industry mogul Chris Parry and also featured Ricky Gervais as "head of speech".
XFM's launch date was set for 1 September 1997, with Crowley the first deejay to broadcast on the station. The day before launch, Diana, Princess of Wales died. The broadcast test tape was discontinued and XFM’s management considered delaying the launch. But a week of promotional live events meant that financially it had to go ahead as planned.
So it was that at midday 1 September 1997 Gary Crowley opened a new radio station with the words "Welcome to XFM, broadcasting on 104.9. We find ourselves starting a radio station today in circumstances we wouldn’t have wished, following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. As a mark of respect to someone we saw as someone going her own way… we wish to dedicate the activities of our launch day to her memory."
Crowley continued to present a mid-morning show until his old employers (and XFM rival) Capital Radio bought the station. He was offered an overnight "graveyard shift" show and decided to quit and return to the BBC, on what was now BBC London 94.9, where he continues to broadcast a two hour weekly show on Saturday evenings. In addition, Gary can often be found on BBC 6music filling in for other presenters.

From 1980 to 1990, Kurer practiced as an attorney with the Zürich office of the international law firm Baker and McKenzie, first as an associate and later as a partner. From 1991 to 2001, Kurer was a partner at the Swiss law firm Homburger (now: Homburger AG) in Zürich. 
In 2001, Kurer was appointed Group General Counsel and Member of the Group Managing Board of UBS AG and in 2002, he was appointed Member of the Executive Board. On 1 April 2008, UBS announced that he would become Chairman of the Board of Directors, replacing Marcel Ospel. On 4 March 2009, UBS announced that Kurer would step down as Chairman of the Board in April and that Kaspar Villiger would be nominated to succeed him. Kurer is now widely seen as a driver behind many of the risk decisions that ultimately led to huge losses for UBS, though he also deserves credit for taking swift action in terms of recapitalising the Bank in 2008.
Awards and honours.
Kurer is a member of the Visiting Committee to the Law School of The University of Chicago. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of a foundation that acts as an advisory board to the University of St. Gallen Program for Law and Economics, and a member of the Committee of Continuing Education, Executive School of Management, Technology and Law, at the University of St. Gallen.

LEXX (text editor)

LEXX is a text editor which was possibly the first to use "live parsing" and colour syntax highlighting. It was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM around 1985. The name was chosen because he wrote it as a tool for lexicographers, during an assignment for Oxford University Press's second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. The program ran (and still, 2012, runs) on mainframes under (VM/CMS). LEXX's design was chosen as a middle ground between specialized syntax directed editors such as Grif and "JANUS" and general purpose editors such as the contemporary Emacs and XEDIT.
LEXX uses dynamically-loaded parsers which assign classes of elements (tokens formed from character strings) to fonts and colors. It allows indention to be used to format and show the structure of the file being edited, and other formatting options allow (for example) the hiding of selected classes of text, such as tags. A collection of screenshots is available.
Reimplemented derivatives of the LEXX concept known as LPEX (for 'Live Parsing Editor) were originally produced for OS/2 and AIX, but now also run on Windows, Linux, and the Java JVM.

Calogero Bagarella

Calogero Bagarella (January 14, 1935 – December 10, 1969) was an Italian criminal and member of the Sicilian Mafia. He was from the town of Corleone and belonged to the Mafia clan of Corleonesi.
Biography.
Calogero Bagarella was born in Corleone to a family of Mafiosi that gave Cosa Nostra various affiliates. He was the second son of Salvatore Bagarella and Lucia Mondello, who moved to the town of Corleone after marriage. This union produced six children which other than Calogero, included Giuseppe, Leoluca, Antonietta and Maria Giovanna. The family lived without any problems for a short while, until Salvatore Bagarella was sent to confinement in Northern Italy from 1963 to 1968 for Mafia-related crimes. Calogero's brother, Giuseppe would eventually meet the same fate, eventually dying in prison in 1972. His mother was thus forced to work from home to support the family, while the children went to school. As a boy, Calogero worked at a mill with his childhood friend Bernardo Provenzano, but barely managed to earn enough to take a little flout home to his family.
From the second half of the 1950s, Calogero Bagarella became affiliated with the Corleonesi clan headed by the doctor, Michele Navarra and was a lieutenant of Navarra's right hand man Luciano Leggio along with Bernardo Provenzano and Salvatore Riina. In fact, Bagarella was the third most important figure in the Leggio faction of the Corleonesi, behind Leggio and Riina. From 1958 to 1963, Bagarella fought in the internal clan war against his former boss, Michele Navarra. After Navarra was murdered on August 2, 1958, Bagarella became known as one of the most fearsome and ruthless killers in all of Sicily.
He was tried in absentia and acquitted of all charges laid against him at the trial which took place after the First Mafia War at Bari on June 11, 1969. On December 10, 1969, Bagarella was killed in an attack on Mafia boss Michele Cavataio, the boss of the Acquasanta quarter in the Viale Lazio in Palermo, known as the Viale Lazio massacre. He was part of a Mafia hit-squad consisting of Bernardo Provenzano, Emanuele D’Agostino of Stefano Bontade’s Santa Maria di Gesù Family and Damiano Caruso a soldier of Giuseppe Di Cristina, the Mafia boss of Riesi. After Bagarella's death, his younger brother Leoluca became one of the most famous and ruthless killers in Sicily.
Bagarella was very close to Salvatore Riina and Bernaro Provenzano since childhood. It was discovered after his death that his girlfriend was Arcangella Riina, one of the younger sisters of Salvatore. Riina, on the other hand, was also the boyfriend of Bagarella's younger sister Antonietta, whom he eventually married in 1974.

Wu Quanyou’s son, Wu Jianquan (1870–1942), loved martial arts from his youth and studied under the tutorship of his father. After 1912 he continuously developed the teaching t'ai chi ch'uan at the Beijing Sport Research Society, gradually refining his father’s style to what is currently recognised as Wu-style.

Adventures in Paradise (Minnie Riperton album)

Adventures in Paradise is the third studio album by Minnie Riperton, produced by Stewart Levine with music by The Crusaders. Joe Sample co-wrote the title song "Adventures in Paradise". The album was a modest success, but didn't match the success of "Perfect Angel". After "Lovin’ You" and "Perfect Angel" finished their chart run, Epic wanted a follow-up disc, and fast. With previous co-producer Stevie Wonder busy recording his "Songs in the Key of Life" (which Minnie would also turn up on singing backup on "Ordinary Pain"), Minnie and husband Richard Rudolph hired Stewart Levine to co-produce her next album. More songs came from the Riperton/Rudolph camp as well as collaborations with Jazz Crusader Joe Sample and songwriter Leon Ware (who was enjoying a hot streak thanks to his work on Marvin Gaye’s album "I Want You"). Guitarist Larry Carlton was brought in as an arranger. The result, "Adventures In Paradise", took on a mellow soul-jazz tone.
Tha album was a standard recording but available in two formats: quadraphonic and stereo. Epic Records anticipated a soul funky sequel, using Family Stone and Tower of Power horn section, which would have been released in November 1975. However, the sessions were never released due to legal issues.
The songs.
The album's best known song is the sensual "Inside My Love". Riperton made it quite clear during the track's initial release that the song wasn't about a woman asking a man to have sex with her. It's about going deeper than that, attaining true intimacy. Despite the singer's groans, a closer listen to the lyrics will prove that in this case love dealt with something way below skin-deep. "Inside My Love" went to number 26 R&B during the summer of 1975, but stalled at #76 on the pop listings. Much of pop radio balked at playing the single due to the lyrical content (“Do you wanna ride, inside my love[...]”) even though Leon Ware claimed that the words were inspired by a church preacher he heard speak when he was a child (the minister said, “let us come into the house of the Lord”).
"Inside My Love" became somewhat of a standard, enjoying numerous covers. Chanté Moore covered it in 1995 for the “New York Undercover” soundtrack and Trina Broussard did the same for the soundtrack to “Love Jones” in 1997. Jean Jacques Smoothie sampled "Inside My Love" for his 2001 hit 2 People. In 2008, it was featured on Grand Theft Auto IV's fictional Soul/R&B radio station The Vibe 98.8. The song was also sampled by Timbaland for singer Aaliyah's song “Heartbroken” from her 1996 album, "One in a Million" with Timbaland deepening Riperton's whistle register vocal note that came during an instrumental break of the song.
"Love and its Glory" was never a hit, but it is an epic love song of two teens struggling to be together, despite parental objections. The girl in the song is named Maya, which is the name of Riperton's daughter.
Artwork.
The album cover has its own story: Minnie is seen sitting serenely next to a lion. Though the actual album photo session was calm, during a subsequent promotional photo shoot with a different lion, the animal lunged at Minnie without any provocation. Fortunately, the animal’s tamer was on the set and the lion was quickly subdued. A film clip of the incident was aired on Sammy Davis Jr’s talk show "Sammy & Company" where Minnie was a guest.
It was apparently around this time that Riperton discovered she had cancer. In 1976, she told Flip Wilson on "The Tonight Show" that she was suffering from breast cancer and had undergone a mastectomy.

George Webster (architect)

George Webster (3 May 1797 – 16 April 1864) was an English architect who practised in Kendal, which was at the time in Westmorland, and later in Cumbria. All of his works were executed near his practice, and were located in Cumbria, in north Lancashire, and in the adjacent parts of Yorkshire. Most of his work was carried out on domestic buildings, but he also designed churches, and public and commercial buildings.
Early life.
George Webster came from a family of builders aspiring to be architects, his father Francis (1767–1827) being described as a " mason, builder, and architect" whose speciality was the production of marble chimney-pieces and funerary monuments. It is not known how George received his architectural training, but he joined his father's business as a partner, and in 1818, when he was aged 21, he had produced his first known major design; this was for the country house of Read Hall in Lancashire.
Works.
Webster's works were geographically confined to the area around his office in Kendal, in what is now Cumbria, the northern parts of Lancashire, and the adjacent parts of Yorkshire. Most of his work was carried out on large houses; in designing new houses, altering and extending others, and designing associated structures such as lodges, gateways and terraces. Among his major new houses were Eshton Hall in Eshton, North Yorkshire (1825–27), and Underley Hall in Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria (1825–28). He remodelled, or made significant additions to Hutton in the Forest, near Skelton, Cumbria (1826), Dallam Tower, near Milnthorpe, Cumbria (1826), Bank Hall, Bretherton, Lancashire (1832–33), Conishead Priory near Ulverston (1838), and Holker Hall, (1838–41) (both the latter being in Cumbria). His earlier designs were mainly in Neoclassical (or Greek Revival) style, often incorporating Doric or Ionic porticos, for example Read Hall, and Esthwaite Lodge near Hawkshead, Cumbria (1819–21). Later he was a pioneer in the use of the Tudor Revival style, using either Elizabethan features, for example at Eshton Hall, or Jacobean features, as at Underley Hall, Penwortham Priory, Penwortham, Lancashire (1832, since demolished), and Bank Hall. Towards the end of his career he incorporated Italianate features, at for example Belsfield, Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria (1844) where he included a tower in the style of Osborne House.
Webster designed at least 13 new churches and remodelled others; these were always in early Gothic Revival style. Most of his country churches are small, but he also designed three larger churches in his home town of Kendal; of these, St Thomas (1835–37) has aisles and lancet windows, and St George (1838–41) is more ambitious with twin turrets at the west end. Both of these, and most if not all of his country churches, were built for the Anglican church. His third Kendal church, which the authors of the "Buildings of England" series consider to be the best of the three, is the Roman Catholic Church of Holy Trinity and St George (1835–37). Webster also designed public buildings, including town halls at Settle (1832), and Kendal (1859), commercial buildings, such as banks in Kendal (1834–35), and Ulverston (1836–38), and the Elba Monument near Burneside, Cumbria (1814).
Family life and later career.
In 1827 Webster married Eleanor Lowrey, with whom he had one son and four daughters. He was involved in the public life of Kendal,serving as mayor in 1829–30. One of his hobbies was collecting Roman coins, medals and antiquities, which possibly developed as a result of his visits to Italy from 1836. In 1845 he took his assistant of many years, Miles Thompson, into partnership, and then he virtually retired from the practice. Webster died at his home, Eller How, in Lindale, Cumbria, leaving an estate of "under £25,000" (£ as of ).

Beloved Enemy

Beloved Enemy is a 1936 American drama film directed by H.C. Potter and starring Merle Oberon, Brian Aherne, and David Niven. It was loosely based on the life of Michael Collins.
Plot.
During the Irish War of Independence, Irish rebel leader Dennis Reardon (Aherne) and English aristocrat Helen Drummond (Oberon) meet and fall in love. Reardon is pursued, however, by British army officer Captain Preston (Niven).
The original movie ended with Reardon getting shot and killed, but did not do well at the box office. A happier ending was also filmed which all subsequent versions have. The original cut has since been lost.
The movie has several comic relief scenes: after a raid on an IRA "safe house", British officers grumble about being not being able to find Reardon, who is in fact standing just behind them; when the Irish Delegation goes to a formal ball and is asked by the footman for their names to be announced, the delegation replies in Irish.

Maesulians

The Massylii or Maesulians were a Berber federation of tribes of eastern Numidia which was formed by an amalgamation of smaller tribes during the 4th century BC. They were ruled by a king. On their loosely defined western frontier was the powerful rival the kingdom of the Masaesyli. To their east lay the territory of the rich and powerful Carthaginian Republic. Their relationship to Carthage resembled that of a protectorate. Carthage maintained its dominance over the Massylii by skillful diplomatic manoeuvering, playing off local tribal and kingdom rivalries. The principal towns of the Massylii were Cirta, Tébessa and Thugga.
Role In The Second Punic War.
In 218 BC war broke out between the Carthaginians and the Romans. 
The Massylii and the Masaesyli who both possessed a strong and proficient cavalry force were allied to the Carthaginian cause and performed valuable service for them in Iberia and Italy. In 206 BC a Massylian prince called Massinissa defected to the Romans. When the Romans finally defeated the Carthaginians in 202 BC they amalgamated the territory of the Massylli and the Masaesyli into one kingdom and gave it to Massinissa who ruled it until his death in approximately 148 BC.

Sellindge Music Festival

Sellindge Music Festival was a three-day outdoor event that took place in the countryside between Ashford and Folkestone in South Kent. The site for the festival was on '"Hope Farm".
Although it planned to be a new style of boutique festival - the festival was actually cancelled in 2010 due to organiser Andre Double's spiralling unpaid debts from Sellindge 2009 for security, marketing and a range of other services. This meant ticket holders for 2010 were refunded well before the launch of the festival.
Starting life initially as a small local 'fair'-like event the festival's biggest year was in 2009, with Supergrass headlining the main stage, alongside a dance tent with Brandon Block, The Hoxton Whores, Micky Slim and several other major headliners.
http://sellindgemusicfestival.co.uk/
2010.
With only a week to go before the Sellindge Music Festival 2010, the event was cancelled and the event website taken offline. The organisers of the festival cited issues with their online payment agent PayPal and stated refunds would be processed in due time. 2010's festival was due to be held 11th - 13th June 2010. The true reason was organiser Andre Doubles personal debts. Refunds are still outstanding (as of January 2013) 
2010 'claimed' scheduled headliners were The Sugarhill Gang (Friday), Reverend and the Makers (Saturday) and Lee 'Scratch' Perry (Sunday), with support from Goldie Lookin' Chain Soundsystem, The Rumble Strips and Johnny Foreigner. Other bands on the line-up included The Foxes, Liam Frost, Eliza Carthy, Mean Poppa Lean, Achilles, James Findlay, Los Salvadores. The festival itself didn't get further than a simple flyer and website.
History.
Background.
The idea for Sellindge Music Festival was conceived in 2003 by Andre Double, who wanted to combine his love of live music with his grandfather's ambition of staging a festival on his family farm. Andre used the backdrop of the Sellindge Steam Special - a family event of over 40 years - to launch a single music marquee in 2005. Playing on bare grass, with a hastily hired PA, over twenty acts performed at the event. The following year saw the marquee move and double in size. By 2007, the music within the Steam Rally had continued to grow, with greater numbers of local bands appearing. A folk tent was added and the team continued to grow. The groundwork had been done and planning for a dedicated music festival was well underway with a passion for a festival for Kent, attracting music lovers of all ages and backgrounds .
2008.
2008 saw the launch of the first full-fledged music festival at Sellindge. The event took place over the weekend of the 6th, 7th and 8th of June with around 60 bands performing over three different stages. Performance areas included the main stage, which was headlined by Idlewild and Mark Morriss of The Bluetones, a folk stage and a tent hosted by BBC Kent Introducing. A dance tent also featured DJs arranged by Bournemouth-based Techno promoters DELETE, including LEK, DJ Mossman, Mudie, Marlow and Dubnium. The festival site played host to further entertainment, including a dedicated VW field and fair-ground.
2009.
2009 saw the largest Sellindge Festival to date, with headline acts including Supergrass, The Holloways, The Young Knives and Marina and the Diamonds. The Headroc tent represented the dance fraternity at the festival, with a uniquely diverse lineup which included the likes of Brandon Block, Micky Slim, Eddy Temple Morris, Gary Dedman Hoxton Whores as primary headliners. Other local DJs included Mezza Sound System, Dr Boss and Rob Cockerton, Groove Monkey, Matter of Phatt, HCIYH alongside many others and a variety of VJs.
As it stands from the organisers personal debts there have been no future plans for any further Sellindge Music Festivals.

NBFC &amp; MFI in India

A Non Banking Financial Company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 of India, engaged in the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares, stock, bondsire-purchase, insurance business, or chit business: but does not include any institution whose principal business is that includes agriculture or industrial activity; or the sale, purchase or construction of immovable property.
Difference between NBFCs & Banks.
NBFCs perform functions similar to that of banks; however there are a few differences in that an NBFC cannot accept demand deposits; an NBFC is not a part of the payment and settlement system and as such, an NBFC cannot issue cheques drawn on itself; and deposit insurance facility of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation is not available for NBFC depositors, unlike banks.
MFI.
Microfinance institutions, also known as MFIs, offer financial services to underprivileged and impoverished communities.
MFIs go for NBFC licences.
An Increasing number of microfinance institutions (MFIs) are seeking non-banking finance company (NBFC) status from RBI to get wide access to funding, including bank finance.
Exemptions granted to NBFCs engaged in microfinance activities.
The Task Force on Supportive Policy and Regulatory Framework for Microfinance setup by NABARD in 1999 provided various recommendations. Accordingly, it was decided to exempt NBFCs which are engaged in micro financing activities, licensed under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956, and which do not accept public deposits, from the purview of Sections 45-IA (registration), 45-IB (maintenance of liquid assets) and 45-IC (transfer of profits to the Reserve Fund) of the RBI Act, 1934.
010
MFIs & SHG-Bank linkage programme.
In a joint fact-finding study on microfinance conducted by the Reserve Bank of India and a few major banks, the following observations were made:
obtaining in the SHG – Bank linkage programme, which takes about six to seven months for group formation and nurturing. As a result, cohesiveness and a sense of purpose were not being built up in the groups formed by these MFIs.
RBI relaxes norms for NBFCs.
NBFCs registered with the Reserve Bank of India may take part in the insurance agency business on a fee basis and without risk participation or the need to seek the bank's approval.
In a notification issued, the RBI said such NBFCs should obtain permission from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority and comply with IRDA regulations for acting as a "composite corporate agent" with insurance companies.
MFIs of India.
Forbes magazine named seven microfinance institutes in India in the list of the world's top 50 microfinance institutions.
Bandhan, as well as two other Indian MFIs—Microcredit Foundation of India (ranked 13th) and Saadhana Microfin Society (15th) – have been placed above Bangladesh-based Grameen Bank (which along with its founder Mohammed Yunus, was awarded the Nobel Prize).
Besides Bandhan, the Microcredit Foundation of India and Saadhana Microfin Society, other Indian entries include Grameen Koota (19th), Sharada's Women's Association for Weaker Section (23rd), SKS Microfinance Private Ltd (44th) and Asmitha Microfin Ltd (29th).
Criticisms.
Recently, microfinance has come under fire in the state of Andhra Pradesh due to allegations of MFIs using coercive recollection practices and charging usurious interest rates. These charges resulted in the state government's passing of the Andhra Pradesh Microfinance Ordinance on October 15, 2010. The Ordinance requires MFIs to register with the state government and gives the state government the power, suo moto, to shut down MFI activity. A number of NBFCs have been affected by the ordinance, including sector heavyweight SKS Microfinance.

Before I Die

Before I Die is a young adult novel written by Jenny Downham, first published by David Fickling Books in 2007. The novel follows the shortly ending life of Tessa, from her perspective.
Plot.
Tessa is diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite her four-year devotion to chemotherapy, she has discovered that her cancer is terminal and her doctors don't give her very long to live. Tessa, with the help of her best friend Zoey, comes up with a list of things she wants to do before she dies, including some risky behaviors that she deems necessary to have "lived". Zoey is excited and supportive of the outrageous bucket list until an unplanned pregnancy test comes up positive.
Tessa's parents are divorced and have very different views on her desire to experience the dangerous side of life before she passes. Her mother is loving and joking about the situation and seems supportive whereas her father is timid and just wants to spend time with his daughter. Tessa's dad is resistant to Tessa's behavior from the start but realizes he has little influence and can only enjoy the time they have left. Her father's main mechanism for coping is denial. She mentions that he spends hours on the computer looking up possible treatments for her even after the doctors have told her that the cancer has consumed her body.
Tessa's brother, Cal, is a brutally honest individual that has mixed feelings throughout the novel ranging from lack of care to jealousy to sadness. In the beginning of the novel, Cal says to his sister "I'm gonna miss you" during a joking situation.
One of Tessa's last wishes is to find love, of which she thinks she has with her neighbour Adam. Adam is shy, and his main priority is taking care of his sickly mother after his father died.
The book, written in first person from Tessa's point of view, follows her last few months of life, explores her relationships with her loved ones, and her personal feelings about being trapped in a failing body. At the end of the novel, Tessa passes away.
Controversy.
In her last months alive, Tessa participates in illegal activities and activities that are discouraged for young adults. The novel alternates in painting these activities in a positive and negative light. Also during these questionable situations, Downham goes into great detail of everything that is occurring, specifically the sex scenes. The main controversy surrounding the novel is the age at which it is targeted and the appropriateness of the material for that age group.
Awards and nominations.
"Before I Die" was listed for the 2007 Guardian Awards and the 2008 Lancashire Children's Book of the Year. It was nominated for the 2008 Carnegie Medal and the 2008 Booktrust Teenage Prize. "Before I Die" won the 2008 Branford Boase Award.
Film adaptation.
The novel has been adapted into a film entitled "Now Is Good" by the production company Blueprint Pictures, in association with BBC Films and the UK Film Council. The film stars Jeremy Irvine as Adam, Dakota Fanning as Tessa and Kaya Scodelario as Zoey. Filming began on location in London and Brighton in July 2011. "Now Is Good" was released in September 2012.

Sneak and peek warrant

A sneak and peek search warrant (also called a covert entry search warrant or a surreptitious entry search warrant) is a search warrant authorizing the law enforcement officers executing it to effect physical entry into private premises without the owner’s or the occupant’s permission or knowledge and to clandestinely search the premises; usually, such entry requires a stealthy breaking and entering.
Law enforcement officers are prohibited from seizing any property from the premises. Sneak and peek warrants are especially beneficial to illegal drug manufacturing investigations because they allow investigative teams to search the premises for chemicals and drug paraphernalia so that they can return with a traditional search warrant.
Relevance to the USA PATRIOT Act.
Under the USA PATRIOT Act signed into law during the 107th United States Congress on October 26, 2001, sneak and peek warrants for the first time in United States history were used as standard procedure in investigations. Sneak and peek warrants are addressed in Section 213, under Title II or the Enhanced Surveillance Procedures. These warrants are not exclusive to acts of foreign and domestic terrorism. Sneak and peek warrants are applicable to any federal crime, including misdemeanors.

<doc id="19664641" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19664641" title="Thomas the Archdeacon">
Thomas the Archdeacon

Thomas the Archdeacon () (c. 1200 – 8 May 1268) was a Roman Catholic cleric, historian and chronicler from Split, often referred to as one of the greatest figures in Croatian historiography.
Life.
What is known about Thomas' life comes from his work, "Historia Salonitana". He speaks of his life in the third person and very briefly, in the style of medieval literature genres. Thomas was born in Split at the beginning of the 13th century. It is not known whether he was of noble or common birth. He was probably educated at the cathedral school in Split. Around 1222 he was sent to study at the University of Bologna. There he perfected skills (under, among others, Accursius) in law, rhetoric, gramathic and notary ("ars dictandi" and ars "notaria"). He saw Saint Francis of Assisi in Bologna, a remarkable event which he mentioned in his work, describing the person of Saint Francis. 
Upon returning to his hometown of Split he advanced fast in church hierarchy. He became notary official (c. 1227), then (1230) the archdeacon (head of the body of canons). He described Mongol siege of Split (1242), Mongol customs and homeland, thus creating first ethnological writings in Croatian historiography. In 1243. body of canons chose Thomas to be archbishop of Split. But, because of his views on Church autonomy in Split, commoners rebelled against him. Fearing for his life, he never occupied that function, and in the end resigned the honor. Because of that, in his work he wrote about future archbishops with bitterness. He died in Split on eight of May 1268. Today, his grave lies in the Church of St. Francis.
Views.
Thomas was a stern advocate of medieval commune movement in Split. He wrote about Croatian nobles (and Hungarian kings in his time) in the hinterland of the city with great animosity, because they tried to crush the autonomy of the city. And conversely, he treated fairly those who respected the commune autonomy (Croatian kings, and later, Hungarian kings in 12th century). In 1239 he organized new („latin“) administration in Split, bringing Gargane de Ascindis from Ancona, as the new Podestà. He was also advocate of Church autonomy within city (in accordance with official Roman Church teaching) which excluded commoners and citizens from interferring in Church business (such as the election of archbishop).
Work.
Thomas' only work is the "Historia Salonitana", the history of archibishops of Salona and Split written in Latin. The work itself is combining three medieval history genres – "historia", "chronica" and "memoriale". Eventually, his work outgrows narrow theme of archbishops, and becomes outstanding literary achievement which encompasses whole of Croatian medieval period up to 13th century. Because of Thomas' original research in archbisphoric archive in Split, he brings facts and news from documents today unknown to contemporary historians. His work is therefore not only of great literally value, but also of historical value for Croatian history.

Eartha (musician)

Eartha, born Eartha Moore in Los Angeles, California, is an American female eclectic, alternative soul singer, songwriter, and musician. The 5’11” sultry raspy-voice contralto who sports a honey-blonde buzz cut has garnered much attention in the underground club, urban, and indie circles. While her musical style is a hybrid of many and evades categorization, she credits her biological mother Zinna Moore, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway as her main musical influences.
Eartha, who is signed to indie label AFRT Music, founded by identical twins Glaurys Ariass and Helsa Ariass, debuted her first release "This I Know" in 2000. The fourteen track release captured a great deal of attention. As a result of the positive feedback on the "Love Jones" track, she released the Maxi-Single "Love Jones", which consists of five mixes in 2001. She then followed up with her sophomore project "Sidebars" in 2002, for which Eartha’s unique vocal style earned her two Grammy Award nominations and a win. She continued to write and contribute with musicians and producers, at times as a ghostwriter. On September 21, 2010, Eartha released her third CD album "Ink Dry Blue."
Personal life.
Eartha’s biological parents Philip L. and Zinna Moore, were forced to give her and older sister to a foster home when mother Zinna was stricken postpartum with a debilitating illness. At six months, Eartha was immediately placed in the home of foster parents Lucy and Otis Rushing. According to "Contemporary Musicians", both Eartha’s birth and foster fathers worked for the same company as machinists, unbeknownst to either. When Philip visited his daughters at the Rushing foster home for the very first time, he realized that Otis was his co-worker and foster father to his daughters. Eartha maintains that although being raised in a good home with a strong Christian upbringing, being raised in a foster home added to her isolation because “no matter how good things are, you still long to be with your family.”
Eartha's birth mother Zinna died in 1995, followed by her foster mother Lucy in 1998. Each death had a profound effect on her music. Many of the tracks from the record "Sidebars" are a result of her losses.
Early years.
Eartha began her musical endeavors as a child. She started singing at the age of 5, and at the age of 6 she began playing the drums and piano. She often followed her biological mother, who was a guitarist and the church organist, to rehearsals. Eartha frequently jumped on the drums to accompany her mother’s playing. During such time, she received guidance and was inspired to pick up other instruments. During her visits to her grandmother’s house, Eartha practiced the piano. When she entered junior high school, and as a member of the Greater Bethany Apostolic Church in Los Angeles under the pastorship of Bishop R.W. McMurray, later succeeded by Bishop Noel Jones, she began leading praise and worship, playing the saxophone and trumpet, while continuing to strengthen her percussion skills. In college, she picked up the guitar, and soon thereafter she formed and directed the Voices of Vision church youth choir. Early on, she embraced classical, rock, hip hop, and alternative genres. Although Eartha’s musical exposure had been mostly gospel music, her artistry was leaning towards a very eclectic and diverse style that would eventually define her own.
Education.
Eartha attended High School in North Hills, CA where she took special interest in English Literature and Poetry. After graduation, she attended Los Angeles El Camino College and then Los Angeles Trade Technical College. Among her favorite authors are Poet Ranier Maria Rilke, Novelist Leo Tolstoy, and the Harlem Renaissance Novelist/Folklorist Zora Neal Hurston. Eartha is an avid reader, and maintains that one is never done with learning and education.
Music career.
This I Know
In 2000, Eartha debuted her first album, "This I Know", which received critical and popular acclaim. The album features Eartha playing all of the instruments, and it covers a wide range of styles, from gospel to R&B and hip-hop. AMG's Jonathan Widran noted, "If this impressive recording is any indication, Eartha Moore stands poised to become a powerful presence..." With the support of DJs and college radio stations, the "Love Jones" track began a ground swell in niche circles, enough to warrant the release of the track as a single.
Love Jones
In 2001, upon release of the single, "Love Jones" landed on the Billboard Hot Dance Breakouts Maxi Singles chart at #2 position, the Urban Inspired Radio Waves at #24; Behind the Scenes WJKS at #1 and WNNN at #10. Shortly thereafter, other stations began adding and spinning the single. These were milestones of achievement, especially for an independent project with very limited distribution outlets. In efforts to counter the shortcomings that often challenge indies, she supported the label’s aggressive campaign to get the music heard at as many outlets as would welcome independent artists. Thus she performed at venues, including but not limited to, the BRE Conference in Atlanta, GA, Billboard Monitor Airplay in New York City, Unifest in Washington DC, Annual Unity Festival, Family Day in the Park in Columbus, GA, and Urban Network Power Jam in Palm Springs, sharing the stage with artists from Tommy Boy, EMI, Sony, Universal, and other labels. She also performed at other radio station sponsored concerts/festivals, clubs, school, churches, and private events across the country. She appeared at the NoHo LA 3rd Anniversary Party and Awards Celebration, which featured art exhibitions by Grammy Award winner Allee Willis, known for mega hits such as "Boogie Wonderland", "I’ll Be There for You", "September", "Neutron Dance", and "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack. Eartha performed for the TV tapings Fountain of Youth and Gospel Superfest 2000, both of which aired in over 40 markets in 2000 and 2001, respectively. She performed live for the ABC’s Louisville, KY early morning newscast. Other appearances included Lady of Soul Awards, the RockWalk induction of Melissa Etheridge and Run DMC among others. The release received considerable attention from record pools, noncommercial, and college radio. The label launched a national movie theater advertising campaign to showcase Eartha in over 15,000 theatre screens and 5,000,000 in-theatre spins of track “Never Change.” The track played in theatres before and after feature films. A national postering campaign at college campi in New York, Atlanta, LA, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, San Francisco, Houston, Philadelphia, and Washington DC was also launched to support the release. Concurrently, the album was capturing the attention of music editors and receiving great coverage. She was definitely making a name for herself. The consensus was that Eartha was indeed a truly gifted and innovative talent whose creative abilities offered great innovation and a promising future. Urban Network’s Music Editor Scott Galloway affirmed, “Eartha testifies with a heartfelt flava.” Billboard Magazine noted, “Interest appears to be building for This I Know, the debut release from this contemporary Christian/gospel artist Eartha…the girl can really sing.” Many artists have begun infusing all types of sounds into their music, making it diverse and often unpredictable. Eartha is leading the way. “In the arena of innovative, new sound there is always one step further you can go…and Eartha Moore has taken that step and has kept right on moving,” said Christian Moore (no relation to Eartha) from Dysonna Magazine. This I Know was noted among the best in recorded music.
Sidebars
In 2002, Eartha 's second album, "Sidebars", seemed initially not to do as well upon release. However, like This I Know, it too sold briskly in nontraditional outlets. The album made some coast to coast club noise via lead single "I’m Still Standing", mixed by hip-hop producer Chris Puram (Janet Jackson, Jermaine Dupri, Missy Elliott, Guns N Roses) “Eartha’s inaugural opus will be in for quite a pleasant surprise. "Sidebars" is solid if not spectacular, as you’re treated to an eclectic mix of retro-soul music.” Although it received little airplay and moved slowly in traditional music outlets, registering only 52 scans according to Sound Scan, AFRT MUSIC reported selling 10,000 copies just two months after its September 2002 release. The feedback in underground circles was positive. While this is a relatively insignificant sales figure for a major artist, it is a very good showing for an indie outfit. The label sold the album at Eartha 's concerts, parties, clubs, and special events. Again, she worked an aggressive grassroots marketing campaign with her label to promote her music on an independent level. She appeared at the RockWalk induction of the Isley Brothers. She worked with DJs, college radio stations, movie theatres, clubs, restaurants, and other nonconventional music outlets across the country, this time launching a 100,000 postering campaign at over 50 colleges, 50,000 CD giveaways, t-shirts, caps, and other promotional items. The hard work paid off in a big way. Eartha earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Female Performance for the song "I'm Still Standing", sharing the field with Mary J. Blige, Ashanti, Aaliyah, and Jill Scott. However, it was her nomination for the "Sidebars" album for which Eartha won the Grammy Award in the Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album category.
A double nomination in two very distinct categories such as R&B and Gospel points to her broad and unique approach to music. She is able to combine biblically based lyrics with infectious dance tracks such that the appeal is quite diverse. Eartha credits her label with fostering this unique approach, something that may not have been possible at a larger and more traditional label. She notes that her label affords her the opportunity to produce her own work without artistic restrictions. Joseph Breuer, who engineered John Carpenter’s Vampires Movie Score and Soundtrack, IMX’s "Introducing IMX", Keith Washington’s "KW", Rhasaan Patterson’s "Love in Stereo", and B.B. King’s "Deuces Wild", said, “The thing I like about Eartha is that she doesn’t have to make it sound good through production because she does sound good.”
Ghostwriting and literary contributions.
Eartha contributed an advice column "Ask Eartha" to Fresh Magazine, which was geared towards issues that are important to teens and young adults. Teens typically wrote about things in pop culture such as music, films, artists, and media images that they found influential. Eartha has also provided ghostwriting services to several music and literary projects. Given her affinity for writing, she enjoys sharing her writing via her blogs Eartha’s Window at Blogger and Eartha’s Blog Spot at MySpace.
Philanthropy.
Eartha is a regular contributor to or participant of charitable events and worthy causes. Among many event participations, Eartha has appeared or performed for the Los Angeles Mission for the benefit of homeless mothers and children, Prison Ministries, Faithwalk Benefit Concert, Justice For Murdered Children Benefit Concert, Churches, Stay in School youth events, 102.7 KISS FM School Tours, Celebration of Champion Benefit for Baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Banks, and UCLA Charity Tennis Event.
Controversy.
Eartha stunned the music world when she got two Grammy nominations for her "Sidebars" album. Many wondered how a relatively unknown artist competing against more notable names, was able to garner the double Grammy nods, especially for I’m Still Standing in the R&B Best Female Vocal Performance category against a superstar lineup consisting of Mary J. Blige, Ashanti, Jill Scott, and Aaliyah. To that, Eartha said, “ I couldn’t even fathom being in this category with such divas.” It is customary for very popular artists to be nominated to this category. However, the Recording Academy criteria is based on the quality and innovation of the recorded music released and submitted for judging; the criteria is not based on artist popularity, radio play, media coverage, or music sales. While a win wasn’t likely for Eartha given the strong competition, “the Grammy selection process was set up so an artist in her situation would have a chance,” said Ron Roecker, Director of Communications for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences. Eartha went on to win in the Best Contemporary Gospel Album for "Sidebars" at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards hosted in New York City on February 23, 2003.

Bonnie Prince Charlie (1948 film)

Bonnie Prince Charlie is a 1948 British historical film depicting the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion and the role of Bonnie Prince Charlie within it. Filmed in Technicolor, it starred David Niven, Jack Hawkins and Margaret Leighton.
Plot.
In 1745, Flora MacDonald plays a Jacobite song on the piano and is scolded by her stepfather for its seditious nature. In Italy, James, the Old Pretender, wants to make another attempt at regaining the English throne but is worried that he is too old. It is decided to send his son, Charles.
Charles arrives in Scotland and meets Donald, a Scottish shepherd, who he asks to send a message to the Scottish nobles, asking them to meet him at his ship. King George II is warned about the impending invasion but is not worried. Charles tries to persuade the nobles to fight for him and most agree, except for Lord MacDonald, who is concerned about the lack of French support. The clans rally to Charles, including Lord George Murray, and proclaim their loyalty to James. The rebellion begins. Charles is accompanied by another shepherd, Blind Jimmie.
Charles and his men enter Edinburgh in triumph. Clementina Walkinshaw throws him a rose and they meet at a dance and begin a romance. General Cope arrives with government troops and Lord Murray does not want to tell Charles about it, thinking little of his military ability, but the prince finds out. Charles recommends they attack and the Highlanders defeat the British at the Battle of Prestonpans in seven minutes.
Charles and his forces then invade England. King George II starts to panic and sends his son, the Duke of Cumberland, to fight him. At Derby, only 127 miles from London, Lord Murray and the army council recommend a retreat, as further support has failed to materialise. Charles opposes this but the retreat goes ahead anyway. Charles is upset and seeks solace with Clementina, who encourages him to leave for France with her, but he elects to stay with his men.
The Duke of Cumberland defeats the Highlanders at the Battle of Culloden (which is not seen in the film) but is unable to find and capture Charles. Charles flees to the islands with Donald, and is hidden by Flora MacDonald. MacDonald helps him evade the government troops looking for him, during the course of which at one stage he has to dress as a woman. MacDonald keeps Charles' spirits high, and he manages to get on a boat to take him back to Italy.
Production.
A movie about Bonnie Prince Charlie was a dream project of Leslie Howard prior to his death. The role was taken by David Niven, who had been a friend of Howard's.
At the time, David Niven said he was keen to make the movie as it gave him the chance to return to England, and he did not enjoy being in Hollywood after the death of his first wife. He was so enthusiastic he did a screen test in costume to persuade Samuel Goldwyn, who had Niven under contract, to loan him out to Alexander Korda, who was producing the film. Later on, however, Niven alleged he had been forced by Goldwyn to take the role. It was one of the few roles Niven played in his career without his moustache. He says Goldwyn received $150,000 from Korda for his services, although Niven only got a fraction of that.
Michael Powell was originally named as the director.
Kora's original choice to play Flora MacDonald was Deborah Kerr, but she accepted a Hollywood contract and was unavailable for filming. Stage actor Margaret Leighton was cast instead.
Filming took place on location in Scotland and at Shepperton studios in London. Soldiers in the British army were hired as extras, but complained they were not paid. The film ended up taking two years to make. Portions of the film were also directed by Robert Stevenson, Leslie Arliss and Alex Korda. Producer Edward Black died not long after the premiere.
Niven later recalled the movie without affection:
"Bonnie Prince Charlie" was one of those huge, florid extravaganzas that reek of disaster from the start. There was never a completed screenplay, and never during the eight months we were shooting were the writers more than two days ahead of the actors. In confusion we suffered three changes of directors, with Korda himself desperately taking over, and at one point I cabled Goldwyn: "I have now worked every day for five months on this picture and nobody can tell me how story ends. Advise." He didn't. He didn't even bother to answer. I loved Alex Korda, a brilliant, generous creature, but with this film he was wallowing in confusion. I felt sorry for him, but sorrier for myself as the Bonnie Prince who would assuredly bear the blame for the impending debacle.
However, Niven did meet his second wife during filming.
Reception.
The film was poorly reviewed by London critics, most criticising the movie as dull and claiming that David Niven was miscast. However, Margaret Leighton received acclaim for her performance. Alex Korda took out paid advertisements defending the movie and criticising the critics.
The film still failed to recoup its cost at the box office.
"Born to be King".
A film about the making of "Bonnie Prince Charlie" – "Born to be King" – is to begin filming at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire in January 2014. It is written and will be directed by Peter Capaldi and will star Ewan McGregor and Kate Hudson.

Minnie (album)

Minnie is the fifth and final studio album (not counting a posthumous release the following year) by Minnie Riperton. She died of cancer two months after its release. It was also her first album for Capitol Records.
With a new record deal under her belt and a guarantee from the label of priority marketing/promotion, Minnie went right to work on what would be her final album. With husband Richard Rudolph, Keni St. Lewis, Gene Dozier, Randy Waldman, Marlo Henderson & Bill Thedford contributing songs, the album served as Minnie’s final statement to the music world and fans. 
Minnie brought son, Marc and daughter Maya Rudolph into the studio to sing background on “Dancin’ & Actin’ Crazy,” while the tender “Lover & Friend” (featuring a reunion with Stevie Wonder, once again under the pseudonym of El Toro Negro) was the perfect ode to her relationship with Richard. Minnie was at her most playful self on her remake of the Doors’ “Light My Fire”, a duet with José Feliciano (who had a hit with his own version of this rock classic in 1968). It's been said that the reason we don't hear José until the second half of the song, is because he had just happened to be at the studio when it was being recorded and popped in. 
When not recording, Minnie was busy as the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society, lobbying the cause for early breast cancer detection. As a result of her efforts, she was presented with the A.C.S. Courage Award at the White House by President Jimmy Carter. While promoting this album, TV appearances kept her busy – "The Mike Douglas Show", "The Merv Griffin Show", "The Tonight Show". Despite her radiant and expressive face, the cameras could not hide how the cancer was ravaging her body. During her last appearance on "The Mike Douglas Show", her right arm was in a fixed position from the cancer's progression.

Calygreyhound

The calygreyhound is a mythical creature, that appears on Medieval heraldry. The de Vere family, who were the Earls of Oxford, used the calygreyhound in their coat of arms in the 15th and 16th centuries. The calygreyhound may be unique to the de Veres, and unlike most heraldic monsters, it made no attempt to seem realistic. A similar monster is the caretyne.
Description.
The calygreyhound is described consistently as having the head of a wildcat, the torso of a deer or antelope, the claws of an eagle on its forefeet, ox hooves, antlers or horns, the hind legs of a lion or ox, and its tail like a lion or poodle. On some rare occasions the Calygreyhound may be seen as depicted with the wings of an eagle. It is said to represent speed. It is generally accepted that the calygreyhound is simply a figment of the artist's imagination, but some parts of it are based on reality. When it is depicted, it does not have a consistent position.

Ernest McIntyre

Ernest "Ernie" McIntyre (19 April 1921 – 10 April 2003) was an Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda and Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1940s.
McIntyre, a ruckman, began his football career at Sandringham in 1939 before crossing to the VFL where he joined St Kilda. A dentist by profession, he played his football as an amateur and didn't appear at all for St Kilda in 1942 due to Navy commitments. He represented Victoria in an interstate match against South Australia at Adelaide in 1945.
Noted for his sportsmanlike conduct on the field, on one occasion during a game he helped an opponent Don Cordner to his feet and also once applauded another opponent Bill Morris after he took a good mark. This rubbed coach Fred Froude and the St Kilda committee up the wrong way and when McIntyre was relegated to 19th man for a game in 1948 he resigned and switched to Collingwood. He appeared in his first ever final series that year, kicking two goals in Collingwood's losing Preliminary Final against Melbourne. 
He also played two first-class cricket matches for Victoria, as a right-arm fast-medium pace bowler, taking 11 wickets at 16.45. Both his matches were against Tasmania in December 1946 in what was an understrength Victorian team as these were players not taking part in their Sheffield Shield campaign. In the second fixture, at Hobart, McIntyre took 4/52 in the first innings which were his career best figures.

Theepan

Velayuthapillai Baheerathakumar ( "Vēlāyutapiḷḷai Pakīratakumār"; 8 January 1966 – 4 April 2009; commonly known by the nom de guerre Theepan) was a leading member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist Tamil militant organisation in Sri Lanka. He played a leading role in the LTTE's military victories in the Vanni during Eelam War III, including Mullaitivu (1996), Kilinochchi (1998), Oddusuddan (1999) and Elephant Pass (2000). He was killed at the Battle of Ananthapuram in the last days of the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Early life and family.
Baheerathakumar was born on 8 January 1966. He was from Vaddakkachchi in Kandavalai, Kilinochchi District. His family were originally from Varani in Jaffna District. He was educated at Chavakachcheri Hindu College.
Baheerathakumar's sister is married to Tamil National Alliance MP S. Shritharan. His three elder brothers live in Canada. His younger brother Sivakumar (nom de guerre Kilman), who was in command of the Charles Anthony division in Trincomalee District, was killed in an accident in 1994. His cousin was Thileepan (alias Curdles or Kerdy), the LTTE's regional commander for Thenmarachchi. 
Baheerathakumar married a former LTTE cadre, they had no children.
Militant.
Baheerathakumar was recruited into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam by his cousin Thileepan in 1984. He took on the nom de guerre Theepan and codename Tango Papa. He sometimes used the aliases Thavabalasingam or Sivatheeban.
Theepan served in Mahattaya's Vanni command. He then joined Mahattaya's bodyguard unit. Mahattaya became deputy leader of the LTTE in 1987 and re-located to Jaffna. Theepan went to Jaffna to be Mahattaya's chief bodyguard. Mahattaya was later transferred back to Vanni and Theepan joined him in Paalamottai, Vavuniya District. Theepan was then appointed military commander for Kilinochchi District where he carried many attacks against the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). 
In 1988 the LTTE's three regional commands in Vanni were unified and placed under the command of Balraj. Theepan became Balraj's deputy. Shortly after the IPKF's withdrawal from Sri Lanka in 1990 war erupted between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government. Balraj and Theepan led a number of successful operations against the Sri Lankan military in the Vanni including the capture of Mankulam and Kokavil in June/July 1990. They also took part in the unsuccessful attack on Elephant Pass in July/August 1991. 
When Balraj was appointed commander of the Charles Anthony Brigade in 1992 Theepan became the new regional commander for Vanni. Theepan was involved in the successful Operation Ithayabhoomi (Heartland), Operation Yarl Devi and Operation Thavalai (Frog). 
Mahattaya was executed by the LTTE for treason in 1994 after which Theepan was transferred from Vanni to Jaffna. Theepan helped defend Jaffna against the Sri Lankan military's Operation Leap Forward. He also took part in the LTTE's Operation Thunderstrike. In October 1995 the Sri Lankan military launched Operation Riviresa (Sun Rays) to re-capture the Jaffna peninsula. After the military reached the outskirts of Jaffna city Theepan and Bhanu were made joint commanders of the LTTE forces defending Jaffna. Despite being surrounded on all sides Theepan and the LTTE held on until 27 November 1995 (Maaveerar Naal). They then withdrew from Jaffna and waded through Jaffna lagoon before being rescued by the Sea Tigers.
Theepan led the reconnaissance of the army camp in Mullaitivu prior to it being overrun by the LTTE in July 1996. In 1997 the Sri Lankan military launched Operation Jayasikurui (Certain Victory) aimed at clearing a land route to the Jaffna peninsula. Theepan was given the task of defending the A9 highway. He was also the LTTE's overall field commander against Jayasikurui. He was at the time joint commander of the Vanni along with Karuna Amman. He took part in the successful capture of Kilinochchi in September 1998. After Jayasikurui was called off in 1998 the LTTE launched Operation Unceasing Waves III which resulted in a series of LTTE victories from Oddusuddan to Elephant Pass. As joint commander of the Vanni region Theepan played a major role in these victories.
After Elephant Pass the LTTE gained some territory in the south of the Jaffna peninsula and Theepan was put in charge of the LTTE's Kilaly-Muhamaalai-Nagar Kovil forward defences. He was appointed Northern Regional Commander. The military launched Operation Agni Kheela (Ball of Fire) to re-capture the southern part of the Jaffna peninsula, particularly Elephant Pass. The operation was disaster for the military - it suffered heavy casualties and Theepan was responsible for this. The LTTE withdrew from the Jaffna peninsula after the military captured Paranthan. Theepan and his cadres withdrew from the peninsula to Challai via Chundikkulam lagoon. He was also in charge of defending Kilinochchi and despite being surrounded the LTTE held on to their administrative capital until 2009.
During the 2001-06 cease fire Theepan led various talks with the government/military and Norwegian mediators. Amongst those who had talks with Theepan were Defence Secretary Austin Fernando, Major General Sarath Fonseka, Major General Shantha Kottegoda, Major General Devinda Kalupahana (ret'd) and Major Shavendra Silva.
Hostilities between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan military resumed in 2006. Theepan was reportedly injured in fighting in August 2006. He was also reportedly injured in an air raid on Kilinochchi in January 2008. Theepan became the de-facto deputy military commander of the LTTE following the death Balraj in May 2008. After the fall of Kilinochchi in January 2009 the LTTE were forced to retreat east. Theepan was involved in heavy fighting as the LTTE battled to retain its dwindling territory. Theepan and his troops, together with other senior LTTE commanders, were surrounded by the military at Ananthapuram, Mullaitivu District. Bhanu, Lawrence and Keerthi broke out of the siege but Theepan refused to go, wanting instead to remain with his troops. The LTTE led by Bhanu tried unsuccessfully to rescue Theepan and his troops. Theepan was injured on 1 April and 2 April 2009. He suffered from internal bleeding and died on 4 April 2009. Theepan's body was identified by a doctor in military custody who had previously treated his chest wounds. Theepan's eleder sister and other family members surrendered to the military. The Battle of Ananthapuram ended the next day, the LTTE had lost more than 500 cadres. Colonel Theepan is believed to have been promoted to Brigadier posthumously.

Eigergletscher railway station

Eigergletscher is a railway station in the municipality of Lauterbrunnen in the canton of Bern. The station is served by trains of the Jungfrau railway, which run to the Jungfraujoch from Kleine Scheidegg, where they connect with services from Interlaken, Lauterbrunnen, Wengen and Grindelwald via the Bernese Oberland railway and the Wengernalp railway. 
The station takes its name from the adjacent Eiger Glacier, and is the Jungfraubahn's last station in the open air, before the line enters its tunnel to the summit. It is also the location of the railway's workshop.
The station opened on 19 September 1898, with the opening of the first open air stretch of the Jungfraubahn. After further construction, the line was extended to a temporary terminus within the tunnel at Rotstock station on 2 August 1899.

Eigerwand railway station

Eigerwand is an underground railway station on the Jungfrau railway, which runs to the Jungfraujoch from Kleine Scheidegg. The station is situated just behind the famous north wall of the Eiger, and its principal purpose is to allow passengers to observe the view through a series of windows carved into the rock face. To that end, uphill trains stop at the station for five minutes. 
The station opened on 28 June 1903, with the extension of the Jungfraubahn from its previous temporary terminus at Rotstock station. After further construction, the line was extended to Eismeer station on 25 July 1905, and Eigerwand became an intermediate stop.
Administratively, the station is in the municipality of Grindelwald in the canton of Bern. However the only access to the station, other than by train, is a door in the sheer face of the mountain. This has, on occasion, been used to rescue mountaineers stranded on the mountain.

Eismeer railway station

Eismeer is an underground railway station on the Jungfrau Railway, which runs to the Jungfraujoch from Kleine Scheidegg. It lies at a height of 3,158 metres above sea level, which makes it the second highest railway station in Europe. Located just behind the south-east face of the Eiger, the station's principal purpose is to allow passengers to observe the view of the Grindelwald-Fiescher Glacier. To that end, uphill trains stop at the station for five minutes. 
The station opened on 25 July 1905, with the extension of the Jungfraubahn from its previous terminus at Eigerwand station. The building of the line this far had depleted the railway company's finances, and for the next seven years, Eismeer was to remain the upper terminus. After further fund-raising and an extended construction period, the line was extended to Jungfraujoch station in 1912 and Eismeer became an intermediate stop.
Administratively, the station is in the municipality of Grindelwald in the canton of Bern.

Higher-order factor analysis

Higher-order factor analysis is a statistical method consisting of repeating steps factor analysis – oblique rotation – factor analysis of rotated factors. Its merit is to enable the researcher to see the hierarchical structure of studied phenomena. To interpret the results, one proceeds either by post-multiplying the primary factor pattern matrix by the higher-order factor pattern matrices (Gorsuch, 1983) and perhaps applying a Varimax rotation to the result (Thompson, 1990) or by using a Schmid-Leiman solution (SLS, Schmid & Leiman, 1957, also known as Schmid-Leiman transformation) which attributes the variation from the primary factors to the second-order factors.

Akan Volcanic Complex

Akan Volcanic Complex is a volcanic group of volcanoes that grew out of the Akan caldera. It is located within Akan National Park, about 50 km Northwest of Kushiro in eastern Hokkaidō, Japan.
Description.
A number of peaks are arranged around the rim of Lake Akan (aka Akan-ko), which fills a 24x 13 km caldera, the tallest being Me-Akan (Meakan), O-Akan (Oakan) and Akan-Fuji.
Oakan is prominently located at the Northeast side of the caldera, while Meakan occupies the opposite, Southwest side, in a cluster of nine stratovolcanoes that include Akan-Fuji, one of many symmetrical Japanese volcanoes named after the renowned Mount Fuji, and Fuppushi volcano (aka Fuppushi-dake, not to be confused with Mount Fuppushi, which is located in Southwestern Hokkaido).
Volcanology.
The Akan caldera was formed 31,500 years ago. Its elongated shape is due to its incremental formation during major explosive eruptions, from the early to the mid-Pleistocene periods. 
The Nakamachineshiri crater of Meakan volcano was formed during a major eruption about 13,500 years ago.
The Me-Akan group of nine overlapping cones on the eastern side of Lake Akan has had mild eruptions since the beginning of the 19th century. The last eruption of this historical volcano was in 2008.
Oakan, Meakan, Furebetsu and Fuppushi are the major post-caldera volcanoes of the Akan volcanic complex.
Me-Akan is one of the most active volcanoes of Hokkaido. Its summit contains the active craters of Ponmachineshiri and Naka-Machineshiri, sites of frequent phreatic eruptions in historical time. Akan-Fuji and O-Akan have not erupted in historical time.
Akan is rated with a volcanic explosivity index of 4 on the Smithsonian VEI scale, the scale's fourth-highest score, based on the volcano's largest known eruption, around 7050 BC.
Following are prominent features of Akan:

William Rugg

William Rugg (also Rugge, Repps, Reppes; died 1550) was an English Benedictine theologian, and bishop of Norwich from 1536 to 1549.
Life.
He was born in Northrepps, Norfolk.
He was a Doctor of Divinity of Gonville Hall, Cambridge in 1513. The Carthusian Thomas Spencer (died 1529) wrote "A Trialogus between Thomas Bilney, Hugh Latimer and William Repps", in which Rugg appears to balance two reformers.
He became Abbot of St Benet's Abbey in 1530. He retained the abbey "in commendam" on being appointed bishop of Norwich; the community there was suppressed in 1539.
He was one of the authors of "The Bishops' Book" of 1537. A theological conservative, he was one of the group trying, without success, to have the Book include material defending pilgrimages. He disputed publicly with Robert Watson, an early evangelical Protestant, in 1539, on the topic of free will.
Resignation.
He resigned his diocese in 1549. Reasons given are financial problems, and royal anger at his sloth in opposing Kett's Rebellion (which may have amounted to sympathy). Gilbert Burnet claimed that the see was needed as place to move Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Westminster, so that Nicholas Ridley could be translated from Rochester, to become bishop of London. Rugge had in fact long been a thorn in Thomas Cranmer's flesh, and after Kett was put down he was eased out in disgrace, but pardoned and pensioned off.

History.
This 90-year old school is nestled in the heart of La Trinidad, Benguet the strawberry capital of the Philippines.
Its history dates back to the time when the Baguio-La Trinidad road was only a rough horse trail in 1916. That was the year when the La Trinidad Experiment Station of the Bureau of Agriculture was turned over to the Bureau of Education. By this turn of events, the La Trinidad Farm School was opened with 30 pupils in Grade V.
This development trail blazed the school's metamorphosis, as it expanded its services and heightened its prominence in the area. According to earlier reports, the Farm School was planned ultimately to develop into a large normal school, where the best Igorot pupils will be given special training for the service as teachers among their own people with emphasis on agricultural education.
The school was renamed La Trinidad National Agricultural School (LTNAS). Four months later, it was nationalized and named the Mountain National Agricultural School (MNAS). It was soon converted into the Mountain National College (MNAC); Mountain Agricultural College ( MAC ); and eventually, the Mountain State Agricultural College (MSAC) in 1969 through RA 5923.
On January 12, 1986, the College was converted to a state university by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 2010 signed by President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Initiatives for this development started in the 70's when former Assemblyman Andres A. Cosalan filed a bill for the elevation of the Mountain State Agricultural College to a University.
Later in 1984, the incumbent Congressman, Samuel M. Dangwa refiled the bill with some amendments until PD 2010 was signed. Another local leader responsible for the attainment of university status was former Benguet Governor Ben Palispis.
From 1916 until the late forties, the school was headed by Donato Cariño, James A. Wright, J.R. Zollanger, Clayton Abbot, Glen Grisham, Russel Taylor, Clayton C. Douglas, and Luis J. Dangilan.
Succeeding heads were Constancio T. Medrana, Julian Mamaril, Amado C. Tolentino, Bruno M. Santos, Pedro Ventura, Antonio G. Dumlao, Lawana T. Batcagan, Fortunato A. Battad, Lucio B. Victor, Cipriano C. Consolacion, Rogelio D. Colting and the incumbent President Ben D. Ladilad.

William White (economist)

William R. White (born 1943 in Kenora, Ontario) is a Canadian economist educated at the University of Windsor and the University of Manchester. He is famous for flagging the wild behaviour in the debt markets before the global storm hit in 2008 (Great Recession). 
In 1969, he began his career as an economist at the Bank of England, the central bank of the United Kingdom. In 1972 he joined the Bank of Canada, the central bank of Canada, where he spent 22 year. His first six years at the Bank of Canada were with the Department of Banking and Financial Analysis, first as an economist and finally as Deputy Chief. In 1978, White became Deputy Chief of the Research Department and was made Chief of the Department in 1979. He was appointed Adviser to the Governor in 1984 and Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada in September 1988. 
In 1994, he joined the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Swiss-based "bank of central banks", as manager in the Monetary and Economic Department. From May 1995 to June 2008, he served as its Economic Adviser and Head of the Monetary and Economic Department. 
He predicted financial crisis of 2007–2010 before 2007's subprime meltdown (Subprime mortgage crisis). He was one of the critics of Alan Greenspan's theory of the role of Monetary Policy as early as 1996. He challenged the former Federal Reserve chairman's view that central bankers can't effectively slow the causes of asset bubbles. On Aug. 28, 2003, White made his argument directly to Greenspan, at the Kansas City Fed's annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. White recommended to "raise interest rates when credit expands too fast and force banks to build up cash cushions in fat times to use in lean years." Greenspan was unconvinced that this would work and said: "there has never been an instance, of which I'm aware, that leaning against the wind was successfully done" 
He retired from the BIS on 30 June, 2008.
In October 2009 he was appointed chairman of the Economic Development and Review Committee at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris. This committee carries on regular evaluations of the policies of both member countries and aspiring members of the OECD. In his capacity as chairman, he also contributes to meetings of WP1 and the Economic Policy Committee of the OECD. He is a member of the Issing Committee, advising the German chancellor on G-20 issues. 
William White has published articles on topics related to monetary and financial stability as well as the process of international cooperation in these areas.

The name of the artificial lake the dam forms was chosen from over a thousand ballots cast by the public, with ultimately being chosen.
History.
In 1966 Fukushima City released the results of a study on predicted future water demand, recommending the building of a dam on the upper portion of the Surikami River. A preliminary survey was carried out in 1973, and a site was chosen. In the following years various geological surveys and public meetings were held.
In 1982 the was formed and began development of plans for the construction of the dam.

AN/MPQ-49 Forward Area Alerting Radar

The AN/MPQ-49 Forward Area Alerting Radar (FAAR) is a lightweight early warning radar system consisting of the AN/TPQ-43 radar, AN/TPX-50 Mark XII IFF receiver, a 5 kW generator set, and a Gama Goat providing mobility.
Development.
FAAR was developed by the US Army in the 1960s to support their field anti-aircraft weapons, the MIM-72 Chaparral and M163 Vulcan Air Defense System, deployed through the 1970s and 80's, and retired from active service in 1991. FAAR units have been used for drug trafficking surveillance in Palm Beach, and since September 1991, offered for sale to foreign users.
The AN/TPQ-43 radar was mounted on a boom that extended upward from the rear of the Gama Goat's trailer. It is a pulse doppler radar that operates in the D band and has a range of about 20 km. Data from the radar was generally not used at the radar site itself, but broadcast over FM radio to the "Target Alerting Data Display Set" (TADDS), a small battery-powered receiver and display unit. Field units, including the Chaparral, Vulcan and FIM-43 Redeye units, used the TADDS as an early-warning display, aiming their optically-guided weapons in the general direction it provided.
FAAR is transported by a Gama Goat and set up behind the front lines. The generator is towed behind the Gama Goat's own trailer, and then detached and operated at a distance from the trailer. The entire system is easily air-transportable.

Garstin Bastion Road, New Delhi

G.B. Road (full name Garstin Bastion Road) is a road from Ajmeri Gate to Lahori Gate in Delhi, India, parallel to the railway lines. It is lined with two or three-storey buildings that have shops on ground floor. About twenty of these buildings have about 100 brothels on the first floor that comes alive at night after the shops at ground level close. It is the biggest red light area in Delhi. The road's name was officially changed to Swami Shradhanand Marg in 1966.
History.
The old city of Delhi, Shahjahanabad, was surrounded by a wall. The wall had many gates and bastions. A bastion is an angular structure projecting outward from the curtain wall of an artillery fortification. It is called "Burj" in Hindi and Urdu. One such burj or bastion was named after a British officer of East India Company. 
The history of G.B. Road can be dated back to Mughal era. It is said that there were total five red light areas or "kotha"s (brothels) in Delhi at that time. Then came the British Raj, when a British collector consolidated all the five kothas in one area on this road. The road has about 100 brothels now.
Market.
The road is famous as a market for machinery, automobile parts, hardware and tools and is the largest market for these items in the National Capital Region. The road is crowded with vehicles and persons during the day as it is a commercial area.
The segment of the road starting form the Ajmeri Gate in the south until the small intersection with a street leading up to Farash Khana in the north has shops on the ground floor and "kothas" or brothels on the first and second floors. 
The streets and houses at the back of the road are residential areas.
Red light area.
The shops close and the lit corridors in front of the shops turn dark. The sex workers locally known as ’kothewalis' doll up in attractive sarees and other dresses. Some of them come down to walk the street. However, most of them stand in the balcony and gesture to men on the road to attract the clients. Pimps on the road try to persuade the clients to come up. The stairs are narrow and dimly lit. Some girls are taken to hotels. The brothels are not high class and the clientele are generally not rich. People from all strata of society come to this place.
It is reported that there are about 4,000 sex workers in more than 100 brothels on the road. Most of them are tricked by boyfriends or others, brought here by deceit, sold into prostitution and held against their will. Once they are broken in, many of them accept their fate and do not attempt to run away. The police raid the brothels many times to free kidnapped girls or harass those brothel-keepers who fail to pay the bribes regularly. 
With increasing use of mobile phones and internet, independent brothels, massage parlours and escort services have become increasingly available in other parts of the city and the number of persons visiting the brothels on G.B. Road has considerably reduced.
Dangerous place at nights.
At night, the road is a dangerous place for the uninitiated. Mugging, snatching of wallets, watches and phones and other crimes happen quite often. A policeman on duty was stabbed to death by muggers just after midnight in September 2012 when a posse of policemen tried to save a man from a gang of criminals who had waylaid him on the road and stabbed him while he was going home from work.

John Gifford Bellett

John Gifford Bellett (19 July 1795 – 10 October 1864) was an Irish Christian writer and theologian, and was influential in the beginning of the Plymouth Brethren movement.
Life.
Bellett was born in Dublin, Ireland. He was educated first at the Grammar School in Exeter, England, then at Trinity College Dublin, where he excelled in Classics, and afterwards in London.
It was in Dublin that, as a layman, he first became acquainted with John Nelson Darby, then a minister in the established Church of Ireland, and in 1829 the pair began meeting with others such as Edward Cronin and Francis Hutchinson for communion and prayer.
Bellett had become a Christian as a student and by 1827 was a layman serving the Church. In a letter to James McAllister, written in 1858, he describes the episcopal charge of William Magee, Archbishop of Dublin, that sought for greater state protection for the Church. The Erastian nature of the charge offended Darby particularly, but also many others including Bellett.
The pair bonded particularly over prophetic issues, and attended meetings and discussions together at the home of Lady Powerscourt, and Bellett and Darby (along with the Brethren movement in particular) were particularly associated with dispensationalism and premillennialism.
Writings.
Bellett wrote many articles and books on scriptural subjects, his most famous works being "The Patriarchs", "The Evangelists" and "The Minor Prophets". A substantial list of his works can be found via STEM Publishing.

Work as performer.
In 1940 Nicola returns to Cuba and travels again to New York. There he continues a long lasting relationship with Cuban guitarist José Rey de La Torre, with whom he gave a concert in Havana, in 1947. After returning to Cuba, Nicola engages on a period of performing activity which concludes in 1957, with a concert where he premiered the famous Danza Característica by Leo Brouwer.
Work as professor.
In 1942 Nicola began teaching in Pro-Arte Musical in substitution of his mother Clara Romero. In 1948 he occupies a position as auxiliary professor at the Conservatorio Municipal de La Habana, until 1951, when he is appointed as titular professor.
From then on, he devoted himself entirely to teaching, assisted by other dedicated collaborators, such as professors Marta Cuervo, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola (his own sister) and Marianela Bonet. At that time, Nicola proceeded to restructure his mother’s method and also added much of his own. He established the basis for a comprehensive guitar didactical system that, including the contribution of many other guitarists, professors and composers, was going to be applied to the academic formation of several generations of Cuban guitarists. Isaac Nicola was professor of numerous renowned Cuban guitar performers and professors such as Leo Brouwer, Jesús Ortega, Marta Cuervo, Clara Nicola, Carlos Molina, Flores Chaviano and Efraín Amador Piñero, among many others.
In 1982, Nicola was one of the founders of the International Guitar Festival in Havana, in which he served permanently as juror.

Chateau Avalon

Chateau Avalon is a luxury hotel/bed & breakfast located in Kansas City, Kansas, U.S.A.. Chateau Avalon took its first reservations in June 2004. The idea for the hotel as a local, upscale, vacation destination was developed by Steve Beaumont, a businessman from Shawnee, Kansas. The 62 room hotel features 23 different types of themed rooms. The Chateau Avalon was one of the first businesses to open its doors in the Village West area of Kansas City, KS, and sits directly across from the Legends Shopping district and the Kansas Speedway at the intersection of Interstate 435 and Interstate 70.
Themed Rooms.
Chateau Avalon is an entirely themed hotel. Each of the 23 room types is decorated lavishly in its own style. Guests of the hotel can choose a Roman Dynasty room, decorated with a wall-to-wall mural of ancient Rome, columns, statuary, and ornate bedding. A Camelot room features stone walls, a drawbridge, a suit of armor, and a boat containing a Jacuzzi tub.

Beaumont Fountain.
Named for its creator, Steve Beaumont, the Beaumont Fountain at Chateau Avalon is the largest structural fountain in Kansas City, a city known for fountains. The fountain took 1 year to build and was dedicated in August 2006. Featuring French, Spanish, and Italian influences, the fountain draws its inspiration from the Fontaine De Mers at the Palace de Concorde in Paris. At night, the fountain is lit on all sides by color-shifting L.E.D. lights. Benches surround the fountain where onlookers can relax, and a private drive allows people to view the fountain without leaving their car.
The fountain is also nearly identical to the fountain in front of the Paris hotel & casino in Las Vegas - but that one was created from copper, whereas the Beaumont Fountain is stone and concrete.

Michael Foster (philosopher)

Michael Beresford Foster (1903–1959) was a tutor in philosophy of Oxford University's Christ Church. For a period up until his death he was the chairman of the British Student Christian Movement. He was one of A.J. Ayer's tutors at Oxford, but their relationship is remembered more as a source of strained feelings than of scholarly fellowship. His disparate works on political science and various doctrines of Christianity (especially the doctrine of creation) have influenced philosophers such as George Grant, who had, when writing his Ph.D. thesis, in fact visited with Foster in England.
Education.
His elementary schooling took place at a Merchant Taylors' School. He then proceeded to St John's College, Oxford, gaining a lifetime friend and colleague John Mabbott. In 1927–1928 he studied under Richard Kroner in Dresden, Germany.
Foster's creation-science thesis.
Foster is remembered for his thesis that the idea of Christian creation and its view of nature—especially in contrast to various Greek views of nature—deeply influenced the development of early modern science. Mention of Foster's thesis can be found in the work of historian and theologian Alister E. McGrath, for example. Foster's thesis (published 1934–1936) differs greatly from the Merton thesis (published 1938) and other harmony-type historical investigations (e.g., that of Reijer Hooykaas) since rather than relying on historical contingencies to establish a relation, he abstractly asserts using analytical philosophy a logical necessity between an orthodox Christian view of creation and a modern view of science, i.e., Christianity is a necessary and sufficient condition for the development of modern science. Although when citing this thesis many scholars refer only to the three 1934–1936 "Mind" journal articles, an until-recently-sometimes-hard-to-locate conference paper given in Italy in 1933 by Foster actually forms a "natural unit" with the three "Mind" articles. This first paper—"The Opposition Between Hegel and the Philosophy of Empiricism"—argued that there is ""one" Christian truth incorporated in modern Empiricism which Hegel's Philosophy ignores. ... This truth is the truth contained in the Christian doctrine of Creation." Foster's creation-science thesis is actually a modern form of what historians and philosophers sometimes more technically label voluntarism, which is a worldview that tends to be held by empiricists: an historically opposing worldview was that of the "intellectualists" who tend to be rationalists.
Mystery and philosophy.
In his book "Mystery and Philosophy" (SCM Press, 1957), Foster seeks to explore the existence of mystery in various secular and religious disciplines in order to discover whether it serves a legitimate function in theology and philosophy when possibly applied to scientific and political realities. Foster asserts that realities exist (i.e., those found in revelation and appealed to in prayer) that are mysterious and will remain so; Foster's view of mystery like that of Gabriel Marcel's is therefore quite different from his view of unsolved puzzles and problems, which he, here following Marcel, holds only temporarily appear mysterious. This idea of irresolvable mystery is similar to ones also found in the works of Eric L. Mascall and Norman Geisler. Foster concludes this book by stating "is directed upon mystery, as revelation springs from mystery, and as prayer seems properly to be directed upon mysterious objects." Mention of Foster's view of mystery can be found in the work of the philosopher Ann Hartle, for example.
Works.
Works of his that remain important to the history of science include "The Christian Doctrine of Creation and the Rise of Modern Natural Science" ("Mind", Volume 43, 1934, p. 446–468), "Christian Theology and Modern Science of Nature." ("Mind", Volume 44, 1935, pp. 439–466 ("part I") and Volume 45, 1936, pp. 1–27 ("part II")).

Road to Freedom (album)

Road to Freedom is the debut album of soul and jazz band Young Disciples, the only album the band ever released. Issued in 1991 on the Talkin' Loud label in the UK and on Polygram in the US, the critically well-received album was influential in the music genres of acid jazz and neo soul. Containing two charting singles, "Get Yourself Together" and "Apparently Nothin'", the album itself reached a chart position of number 21. It was reissued in 1993 in limited edition with a bonus remix EP of the song "Apparently Nothin'".
Background.
The Young Disciples were formed when British duo Femi Williams and Marco Nelson invited American vocalist Carleen Anderson to join them. The trio released two singles, each of which charted separately twice: "Get Yourself Together" at number 68 (1990-10-13) and number 65 (1991-10-05) and "Apparently Nothin'" at number 46 (1991-02-23) and number 13 (1991-08-03). A 1992 eponymous EP also charted, reaching number 48 (1992-09-02). 
"The Independent" described "Apparently Nothin'" as "era-defining", indicating that singer Anderson "became on of the most recognisable voices of the soul, jazz-funk movement" of the time and that the emergence of the band along with acts Soul II Soul, Omar, Incognito, D'Influence and Galliano "was as groundbreaking an era as black British music has ever known." But in spite of the success of the singles and the album, which charted at number 21, it was the only album the trio ever produced. According to Anderson, the album was a "fluke", as Nelson "never felt comfortable or wanted the role of being an artist".
Release and reception.
The album was first released in the UK in 1991 on the label Talkin' Loud. It was later released in the United States on Polygram Records with some changes in the track list. On the British edition, the songs "All I Have" and "Step Right On" are dub versions, but for the US release they were replaced with vocal versions. The album was re-released as a limited edition in 1993 with an additional disc, a remix EP of "Apparently Nothing."
The album was critically well received. "Trouser Press" described it as "a masterpiece of understated soul, a seamless blend of samplers and studio musicians and a blueprint for the nascent acid jazz and trip-hop movements." "The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel" listed it as among the ten best albums of 1991, with reviewer Robert Tanzilo noting that "cream of London's jazz/soul posse get the formula right..." "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" stated that "[with each track on "Road to Freedom," the road gets a little easier to travel." "Billboard" magazine wrote favorably of the album, stating that it "easily stands the test of time, thanks to clever, well-crafted tunes that are steeped in retro-funk and R&B sensibilities." In 2004, the album was featured at number 84 in an "Observer" poll of 100 music industry professionals of "The 100 Greatest British Albums". In its review at the time, "The Observer" indicated that the album did not reach the sales it deserved as "a record that revels in understated soul and sample-savvy jazz, rare groove and hip hop."
Influence.
In spite of underselling, it became a highly influential album in two genres. 2002's "The Techno Primer" indicates it was "very influential" in acid jazz, as the band "set the tone for this movement." In the latter half of the 2000s, BBC disc jockey Trevor Nelson featured the album as "album of the week", noting that due to the album's combination of influences—"muscular" funk, jazz, R&B and British Hip Hop—with "clever, unpredictable productions" and Anderson's "low, smoky vocals", the album "is still deemed to be one of the most important albums to emerge from the acid jazz scene." 2006's "A Change is Gonna Come" also cites the album as important in neo soul, including it along with R. Kelly's "R.", D'Angelo's "Voodoo", Maxwell's "Urban Hang Suite", Aaliyah's self-titled final release and Faith Evans' "Keep the Faith" as among "the starter kit" for the genre.
Track listing.

Maharashtra Cricket Association Cricket Stadium, Pune

Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium is a cricket stadium located at Gahunje near Pune, India. It serves as the home stadium for the Indian Premier League team Pune Warriors India and Maharashtra cricket team including headquarters for the Maharashtra Cricket Association.
With India having the largest cricket audience in the world and Indian influence in international cricket growing, the MCA decided a new stadium was needed. Hopkins Architects of London was commissioned to design a new 36,000 seat stadium in Pune and the stadium was the result.
The stadium features a terrace surrounding the pitch, where spectators can sit. Four stands surround the terrace, accessed via a wide pedestrian concourse, with the gaps between the stands allowing light in and spectators to enjoy the surrounding views. Upper levels include further seating for spectators, a members' pavilion, hospitality boxes, and facilities for broadcasting and press. Parking is provided on surrounding land. Membrane roofs provide shade from the sun.
Members' amenities on the adjacent practice ground include restaurants, sports and spa facilities and a residential Indoor Cricket Academy.
The new MCA Stadium was inaugurated on 1 April 2012 and the first match was played between Kings XI Punjab and Pune Warriors on 12 April 2012. The first 20-20 International match at the stadium was played between India and England on 20 December 2012.
History.
The MCA's decision to build a new Cricket stadium in Pune stemmed from a dispute with the Pune Municipal Corporation, regarding ticket allocations for Nehru Stadium. This conflict came to a head when an international match between India and Sri Lanka was moved to Kolkata, with the MCA stating they were in no position to host the match. Following this, the MCA decided a new stadium was needed. MCA Pune was inaugurated by the then ICC President and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar on 1 April 2012.
In 2013, the Indian company Sahara India Pariwar bought the naming rights and the stadium was renamed the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium. However, the name was changed back to the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium because Sahara paid only a part of the Rs. 200 crore that it had promised when acquiring the rights.
Construction.
The original completion date was November 2010 at a cost of Rs 1.50 billion, covering and area of . However, the stadium was ready by 2012 . As a result, the stadium was not able to host ICC Cricket World Cup matches as originally intended.
The stadium is an astute addition to Hopkins Architects' already impressive portfolio: the prestigious practice also has notable work at London's Lord's and Hampshire County Cricket grounds, and the National Tennis Centre at Roehampton (completed February 2007), along with its recent London Velopark win.
The MPIC project included: 
The site is located close the Mumbai Pune Expressway, just outside the city of Pune, with dramatic views of the surrounding mountains.
The stadium and the seating arrangement have been designed in such a way that an unobstructed view is assured from each location.
The most important feature of this stadium is the rain water drainage system. Many a times, matches are abandoned, due to heavy downpour.To overcome this problem, MCA opted for sand based outfield developed departmentally with technical assistance from STRI Limited, UK Due to this technology, even during the heavy showers, water on the outfield drained out fast making it ready for play again just in some minutes.

Türje

Türje is a village in Zala County, Hungary. The village is located in the North-Eastern part of Zala County, near the great turn of Zala river, between the Keszthelyi Mountains and Kemeneshát Hills. The village has a railway station on the line of the Boba–Őrihodos railway which is connecting the two local centers of Zalaegerszeg and Celldömölk. It is also connected with Zalaszentgrót by bus. 
History.
The foundation of the village may go back to the 10th century. The monastery of the premontre monks was founded at the beginning of the 13th century. In the old charters, the village was mentioned in 1234. In this time, the Türje genera was the landowner of the village and the neighboring villages too. The provostry was a basic administrative center between 1268 and 1358. Its role in the economic transportations between Buda and Venezia gave emphasis to the development of the village in the 14th century.
Turks destroyed the village in 1532. Later the village received the status of opidium, with merchant town rights 1535. In 1566, the troops of Sümeg occupied the monastery and burned the church. The bishop of Veszprém rebuilt the monastery as a fortress against the Turks in the long wars of the 16th century. During the last attack of the Turks against Vienna, Törje become deserted by the Turkish army. 
In the rebuilding period of the late 1690s, Türje again received the rights of the opidium town in 1703. In the Rákóczi freedom fights, Türje was a base for the kuruc (Hungarian) troops. For this reason, the Austrian general Rabutin burned the village again in 1707. 
In the years of 1720, the premontre monks returned; however, they were governed from two Austrian monasteries of Pernegg and Hradisch. Finally, the monastery became independent in 1802. In this period, the monastery was the landowner of the village. 
The railway construction of the late 19th century gave impetus to the development of the village.
Tourism.
The main tourist attractions in Türje are the monastery and the romanesque church. Türje become famous by the discovery of medieval murals of the Saint Ladislaus legend on the northern walls. Over Tereske, Ócsa, Vizsoly this church is the fourth important place where it was found.

The name is spelled Txintxon in Basque and in Cape Verdean creole (the latter also features the alternate spellings "txin-txon", "txintxom", "tchimtchom", "tchintchom" or "tchintchon"). In Uruguay, the game is called Conga or La Conga.
Game rules.
The game of Chinchón is played with a Spanish 40 or 48-card pack. The rules of the game are very similar to those of Gin Rummy, that is, seven cards are given to each player, and the remaining of the deck is laid in the table face down to form the stock. The top card of this pile is then turned face up and laid beside it to start the discard pile. The players look at and sort their cards, and then play by turns. Each turn consists of a draw and a discard:
Once a player has enough sets, they may decide to meld their cards, laying off their hand on the table, and the round ends. That can be done when the player thinks that the value of their unmatched cards, called ""deadwood"" in Rummy, is less than that of the other players. Each of the players score penalty points equivalent to the sum of the face value of the unmatched cards left in their hand. If a player has no unmatched cards, that is, Gin, they earn a bonus of -10 points. A player automatically wins the game if they manage to make a sequence of seven cards, called chinchón.
When one of the players reaches 100 or more, the game ends, and the player with the lowest score wins.
Variations.
Conga.
In Uruguay, Conga ends when only one player remaining has less than 100 points, as all other players with more than 100 can "reenganche" with the player that has the highest score under 100. Also, players can only meld their cards if they have 5 or less points in their hand, unless their score is 96 or more, as melding requires staying in the game at 100 or less.

Bill Barraclough

William "Bill" Barraclough (3 January 1909 – 6 August 1969) was an English footballer who played as an outside left in the Football League for Hull City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chelsea and Doncaster Rovers. He also represented Colchester United in their first-ever season and Peterborough United.
Career.
Born in Kingston upon Hull, Barraclough began his career at Bridlington Town before signing for hometown club Hull City at the age of 16. He made nine Football League appearances while at Boothferry Park, and he had done enough to convince Wolverhampton Wanderers to sign him in 1928.
Barraclough made his Wolves debut on 15 December 1928 in a 3–2 win against Clapham Orient but could only manage three appearances during the 1928–29 season. However, he was a virtual ever-present when Wolves won the Second Division championship in the 1931–32 season, scoring seven times. The wide-man remained a first choice player as the club consolidated in the top flight over the next two seasons before leaving to join Chelsea in October 1934.
Following his Chelsea debut on 3 November 1934, Barraclough became an unpopular figure with the West London faithful, with his intricate ball skills occasionally being displayed at the cost of directness, often finding himself being barracked by some members of the crowd. Despite this, he made 74 league appearances in two-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge, scoring eight times, additionally notching three goals in seven FA Cup outings.
With a £2,500 price tag, Barraclough moved to newly formed Southern League club Colchester United for their inaugural season in 1937, making his debut in a 0–0 draw with Yeovil & Petters United on 11 September 1937 at Layer Road. However, Barraclough will go down in history as the first-ever Colchester player to be sent off when he received his marching orders on 25 November 1937 in a 2–1 defeat to Norwich City Reserves for persistently questioning the referee. United manager Ted Davis said of the incident that ""Barraclough suffered a grave injustice in being ordered off for what was a trivial offence."" Such was the gravity of the situation that the Football Association saw fit to warn Barraclough as to his future conduct. He made 19 league appearances and scored two goals for Colchester before being released by Davis at the end of the season.
After his release from Colchester, Barraclough joined Doncaster Rovers for a then-record £500 fee, a sum that went to Chelsea as they still held his league registration. He was involved in further misdemeanours at Doncaster in a game against Scunthorpe United, but the FA took no further action owing to his improvement in character. He later played for Peterborough United and made a return to Hull City during the war years as a guest player during the 1940–41 season, scoring two goals in 19 games.
Later life.
During the war, Barraclough was based in both Hull and Colchester, serving with the RADC in the latter. He returned to Hull to work as a clerk at the Port of Hull and later worked as a fruit merchant before his death on 6 August 1969.

War in Afghanistan (2001–present)

The War in Afghanistan (2001–present) refers to the intervention by NATO and allied forces in the ongoing Afghan civil war. The war followed the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in an effort to dismantle al-Qaeda and eliminate its safe haven by removing the Taliban from power.
U.S. President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda. The Taliban requested that bin Laden leave the country, but declined to extradite him without evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. The United States refused to negotiate and launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, include the Northern Alliance. The U.S. and allies drove the Taliban from power and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions.
In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), to oversee security in the country and train Afghan National Security Forces. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
In 2003, NATO assumed leadership of ISAF, with troops from 43 countries. NATO members provided the core of the force. One portion of U.S. forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct American command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement and in 2003 launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.
Though vastly outgunned and outnumbered, the Taliban insurgents, most notably the Haqqani Network and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, have waged asymmetric warfare with guerilla raids and ambushes in the countryside, suicide attacks against urban targets and turncoat killings against coalition forces. The Taliban exploited weaknesses in the Afghan government, among the most corrupt in the world, to reassert influence across rural areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan. ISAF responded in 2006 by increasing troops for counterinsurgency operations to "clear and hold" villages and "nation building" projects to "win hearts and minds".
While ISAF continued to battle the Taliban insurgency, fighting crossed into neighboring North-West Pakistan. In 2004, the Pakistani Army began to clash with local tribes hosting al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. The U.S. military launched drone attacks in Pakistan to kill insurgent leaders. This resulted in the start of an insurgency in Waziristan in 2007.
On 2 May 2011, U.S. Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad, Pakistan. About three weeks later, NATO leaders endorsed for withdrawing their forces. UN-backed peace talks began between the Afghan government and the Taliban. As of 2013, tens of thousands of people had been killed in the war. Over 4,000 ISAF soldiers and civilian contractors as well as over 10,000 Afghan National Security Forces had been killed.
Historical background.
Origins of Afghanistan's civil war.
Afghanistan's political order began to break down with the overthrow of King Zahir Shah by his cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan in a bloodless 1973 coup. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, emanicipation of women and Pashtun nationalism. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive Pashtun population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began to encourage Afghan Islamic leaders such as Burhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in a coup by Afghan's Communist Party, his former partner in government, known as the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition from Islamic leaders across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including Ismail Khan's Herat Uprising. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on September 11, 1979 when Hafizullah Amin ousted Nur Muhammad Taraki. The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, intervened militarily three months later, to depose Amin and install another PDA faction led by Babrak Karmal.
The entry of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its Cold War rivals, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously-motivated mujahideen held sway in much of the countryside. Beside Rabbani, Hekmatar and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included Jalaluddin Haqqani. The CIA worked closely with Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as "Afghan Arabs", including Osama Bin Laden.
After the withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan in May 1989, the PDPA regime under Najibullah held on until 1992, when the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum cleared the approach to Kabul. With the political stage cleared of Afghan socialists, the remaining Islamic warlords vied for power. By then Bin Laden had left the country. The United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.
Warlord rule (1992–1996).
In 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul. In late 1994, Rabbani's defense minister, Ahmad Shah Massoud defeated Hekmatyr in Kabul and ended ongoing bombardment of the capital. Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation. Other warlords, including Ismail Khan in the west and Dostum in the north maintained their fiefdoms.
In 1994, Mullah Omar, a Pashtun, a mujahideen who taught at a Pakistani madrassa, returned to Kandahar and founded the Taliban. His followers were religious students, known as the "Talib" and they sought to end warlordism through strict adherence to Islamic law. By November 1994, the Taliban had captured all of Kandahar Province. They declined the government's offer to join in a coalition government and marched on Kabul in 1995.
Taliban Emirate vs Northern Alliance.
The Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of costly defeats. Pakistan provided strong support to the Taliban. Analysts such as Amin Saikal described the group as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan's regional interests, which the Taliban denied. The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were driven by back by Massoud.
On 27 September 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They imposed their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school, or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.
According to the Pakistani expert Ahmed Rashid, "between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan" on the side of the Taliban.
Massoud and Dostum, former arch-enemies, created a United Front against the Taliban, commonly known as the Northern Alliance. In addition to Massoud's Tajik force and Dostum's Uzbeks, the United Front included Hazara factions and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq and Haji Abdul Qadir. Abdul Haq also gathered a limited number of defecting Pashtun Taliban. Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which the journalist Steve Coll referred to as the "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, "It's crazy that you have this today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were all ready to buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." The Northern Alliance received varying degrees of support from Russia, Iran, Tajikistan and India.
The Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998 and drove Dostum into exile.
The conflict was brutal. According the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians. UN officials stated that there had been "15 massacres" between 1996 and 2001. The Taliban especially targeted the Shiite Hazaras. In retaliation for the execution of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by Uzbek general Abdul Malik Pahlawan in 1997, the Taliban executed about 4,000 civilians after taking Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998.
Bin Laden's so-called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians. The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing "Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people".
By 2001, the Taliban controlled as much as 90% of the country, with the Northern Alliance confined to the country's northeast corner. Fighting alongside Taliban forces were some 28,000-30,000 Pakistanis and 2,000-3,000 Al Qaeda militants.
Al-Qaeda.
In August 1996, Bin Laden was forced to leave Sudan and arrived in Jalabad, Afghanistan. He had founded Al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to support the mujahideen's war against the Soviets, but became disillusioned by infighting among warlords. He grew close to Mullah Omar and moved Al Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan.
The 9/11 Commission in the U.S. reported found that under the Taliban, al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions. While al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan, it also supported training camps of other organizations. An estimated 10,000 and 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front. A smaller number were inducted into al-Qaeda.
After the August 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings were linked to bin Laden, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes on militant training camps in Afghanistan. U.S. officials pressed the Taliban to surrender bin Laden. In 1999, the international community imposed sanctions on the Taliban, calling for bin Laden to be surrendered. The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed these demands.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Special Activities Division paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden. These teams planned several operations, but did not receive the order to proceed from President Clinton. Their efforts built relationships with Afghan leaders that proved essential in the 2001 invasion.
Change in U.S. policy toward Afghanistan.
During the Clinton administration, the U.S. tended to favor Pakistan and until 1998-1999 had no clear policy toward Afghanistan. In 1997, for example, the U.S. State Department's Robin Raphel told Massoud to surrender to the Taliban. Massoud responded that, as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat, he would continue to defend it from the Taliban. Around the same time, top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to try to persuade the United Front not to take advantage of a chance to make crucial gains against the Taliban. They insisted it was the time for a cease-fire and an arms embargo. At the time, Pakistan began a "Berlin-like airlift to resupply and re-equip the Taliban", financed with Saudi money.
U.S. policy toward Afghanistan changed after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. Subsequently, Osama bin Laden was indicted for his involvement in the embassy bombings. In 1999 both the U.S. and the United Nations enacted sanctions against the Taliban via United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267, which demanded the Taliban surrender Osama bin Laden for trial in the U.S. and close all terrorist bases in Afghanistan. The only collaboration between Massoud and the US at the time was an effort with the CIA to trace bin Laden following the 1998 bombings. The U.S. and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.
By 2001 the change of policy sought by CIA officers who knew Massoud was underway. CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counter-terrorist Center, began to draft a formal finding for President George W. Bush's signature, authorizing a covert action program in Afghanistan. It would be the first in a decade to seek to influence the course of the Afghan war in favor of Massoud. Richard A. Clarke, chair of the Counter-Terrorism Security Group under the Clinton administration, and later an official in the Bush administration, allegedly presented a plan to incoming Bush National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in January 2001.
A change in US policy was effected in August 2001. The Bush administration agreed on a plan to start supporting Massoud. A meeting of top national security officials agreed that the Taliban would be presented with an ultimatum to hand over bin Laden and other al-Qaeda operatives. If the Taliban refused, the US would provide covert military aid to anti-Taliban groups. If both those options failed, "the deputies agreed that the United States would seek to overthrow the Taliban regime through more direct action."
Northern Alliance on the eve of 9/11.
Ahmad Shah Massoud was the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. In the areas under his control, Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women's Rights Declaration. As a consequence, many civilians had fled to areas under his control. In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban.
In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan". That part of the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually develop. Among those in attendance was Hamid Karzai.
In early 2001, Massoud, with other ethnic leaders, addressed the European Parliament in Brussels, asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan. He said that the Taliban and al-Qaeda had introduced "a very wrong perception of Islam" and that without the support of Pakistan and Osama bin Laden, the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for another year. On this visit to Europe, he warned that his intelligence had gathered information about an imminent, large-scale attack on U.S. soil.
On 9 September 2001, Massoud was critically wounded in a suicide attack by two Arabs posing as journalists, who detonated a bomb hidden in their video camera during an interview in Khoja Bahauddin, in the Takhar Province of Afghanistan. Massoud died in the helicopter taking him to a hospital. The funeral, held in a rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning Afghans.
September 11, 2001 Attacks.
On the morning of 11 September 2001, al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks on U.S. soil. Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked. The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing everyone on board and thousands working in the buildings. Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C.. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, in rural Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C., to target the White House, or the U.S. Capitol. No flights had survivors.
Nearly 3,000 people, including the 19 hijackers, died in the attacks. According to the New York State Health Department, 836 responders, including firefighters and police personnel, had died as of June 2009.
Declaration of war.
The case for war.
On 11 September, Taliban foreign minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil "denouncethe terrorist attack, whoever is behind it". The following day, President Bush called the attacks more than just "acts of terror" but "acts of war" and resolved to pursue and conquer an "enemy" that would no longer be safe in "its harbors". The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Salam Zaeef said on 13 September that the Taliban would consider extraditing bin Laden if there was solid evidence linking him to the attacks. Though in 2004, Osama bin Laden eventually took responsibility for the 9/11 attacks, he denied having any involvement in a statement issued on September 17 and by interview on September 29.
The State Department, in a memo dated 14 September, demanded that the Taliban surrender all known al-Qaeda associates in Afghanistan, provide intelligence on him and his affiliates and expel all terrorists from Afghanistan. On 18 September, the director of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, Mahmud Ahmed conveyed these demands to Mullah Omar and the senior Taliban leadership, whose response was "not negative on all points". Mahmud reported that the Taliban leadership was in "deep introspection" and waiting for the recommendation of a grand council of religious clerics that was assembling to decide the matter. On 20 September, President Bush, in an address to Congress, demanded the Taliban deliver Osama bin Laden and destroy al Qaeda bases.
The same day, a grand council of over 1,000 Muslim clerics from across Afghanstan that had convened to decide bin Laden's fate, issued a fatwa, expressing sadness for the deaths in the 9/11 attacks, urging bin Laden to leave their country and calling on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to conduct an independent investigation of "recent events to clarify the reality and prevent harassment of innocent people". The fatwa went on to warn that should the United States not agree with its decision and invade Afghanistan, "jihad becomes an order for all Muslims." White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer rejected the response, saying the time for talk had ended and it was time for action.
On 21 September, Taliban representatives in Pakistan reacted to the U.S. response with defiance. Zaeef said the Taliban were ready, if necessary, for war with the United States. His deputy Suhail Shaheen, warned that a U.S. invasion would share in the same fate that befell Great Britain and the Soviet Union in previous centuries. Zaeef reiterated the demand for evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the 9/11 attacks. "If the Americans provide evidence, we will cooperate with them, but they do not provide evidence," he said. "In America, if I think you are a terrorist, is it properly justified that you should be punished without evidence?" he asked. "This is an international principle. If you use the principle, why do you not apply it to Afghanistan?" On 23 September, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told NBC's Meet the Press that the U.S. government would, "in the near future" release "a document that will describe quite clearly the evidence ... linking Laden to this attack." The evidence was not made public but instead shown to Pakistan's government whose leaders later stated that the materials they had seen "providesufficient basis for indictment in a court of law". Pakistan ISI chief Lieutenant General Mahmud Ahmed shared information provided to him by the U.S. with Taliban leaders.
On 24 September, Mahmoud told the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan that while the Taliban was "weak and ill-prepared to face the American onslaught", "real victory will come through negotiations" for if the Taliban were eliminated, Afghanistan would revert to warlordism. On 28 September, he led a delegation of eight Pakistani religious leaders to persuade Mullah Omar to accept having religious leaders from Islamic countries examine the evidence and decide bin Laden's fate. Mullah Omar was noncommittal. The U.S. government remained opposed to any negotiations with the Taliban.
Meanwhile the U.S. Department of Defense under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, was exploring ways to broaden the military response beyond Afghanistan. In a 9/30 memo to President Bush, Rumsfeld argued "finding a few hundred terrorists in the caves of Afghanistan" was not the U.S. government's "strong suit", which should instead use "the vastness of our military and humanitarian resources" to strengthen the domestic opposition in "terrorist-supporting states" and achieve regime change in "Afghanistan and another key State (or two) that supports terrorism".
On 1 October, Mullah Omar agreed to a proposal by Qazi Hussain Ahmad, the head of Pakistan's most important Islamic party, the Jamaat-i-Islami, to have bin Laden taken to Pakistan where he would be held under house arrest in Peshawar and tried by an international tribunal. Pakistan's president Pervez Musharraf blocked the plan because he could not guarantee bin Laden's safety. On 2 October, Zaeef appealed to the United States to negotiate, "We do not want to compound the problems of the people, the country or the region." He pleaded, "the Afghan people need food, need aid, need shelter, not war." The U.S. government refused to negotiate and instead focused on building a new government around former Afghan King Zahir Shah. The British Prime Minister Tony Blair called on the Taliban to "surrender the terrorists or surrender power". Mullah Omar warned that unlike the former King's government, which was overthrown in 1973 and surrendered, the Taliban "would just retreat to the mountains" and continue to fight.
On 5 October, the Taliban offered to try bin Laden in an Afghan court, so long as the U.S. provided what it called "solid evidence" of his guilt. The U.S. government dismissed the request for proof as "request for delay or prevarication"; NATO commander George Robertson said the evidence was "clear and compelling". On 7 October, as the U.S. aerial bombing campaign began, President Bush ignored questions about the Taliban's offer and said instead "Full warning had been given, and time is running out." The same day, the State Department gave the Pakistani government one last message to the Taliban: Hand over all al-Qaeda leaders or "every pillar of the Taliban regime will be destroyed."
A week into the bombing campaign, on 14 October, Abdul Kabir, the Taliban's third ranking leader, offered to hand over bin Laden if the U.S. government provided evidence of his guilt and halted the bombing campaign. President Bush rejected the offer as non-negotiable. On 16 October, Muttawakil, the Taliban foreign minister, dropped the condition to see evidence and offered to send bin Laden to a third country in return for a halt to the bombing. US officials also rejected this offer. At that time, some Afghan experts said the United States failed to recognize the Taliban's need for a "face-saving formula". In 2007, bin Laden claimed that the Taliban had no knowledge of his plans for the 9/11 attacks.
Legal basis for war.
On 14 September 2001 Congress passed legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which was signed on 18 September 2001 by President Bush. It authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The Bush administration, for its part, did not seek a declaration of war and labeled Taliban troops as supporters of terrorists rather than soldiers. It thus defined them as outside the protections of the Geneva Convention and the due process of law. This position was later overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008, following other decisions that overturned some US positions. Military lawyers responsible for prosecuting detainees had questioned some of the policies. Internal disputes were revealed years later.
The United Nations Charter, to which all Coalition countries are signatories, provides that UN member states must settle international disputes peacefully and that no member nation can use military force except in self-defense. The U.S. Constitution states that international treaties that are ratified by the U.S., such as the United Nations Charter, are the "law of the land". The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) did not authorize the U.S.-led military campaign.
Defenders of the invasion argued that UNSC authorization was not required, since the invasion was an act of collective self-defense provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and not a war of aggression. Critics claimed that the invasion was illegitimate under Article 51 because the 9/11 attacks were not “armed attacks” by another state, but were perpetrated by non-state actors. They alleged that the attackers had no proven connection to Afghanistan or the Taliban. Critics claimed that even if a state had made the 9/11 attacks, no bombing campaign would constitute self-defense. They interpreted self-defense to cover actions that were "instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation."
On 20 December 2001, more than two months after the attack began, the UNSC authorized the creation of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to assist the Afghan Interim Authority in maintaining security. Command of ISAF passed to NATO on 11 August 2003, following the US invasion of Iraq in March of that year.
History of the conflict.
2001: Overthrow of the Taliban.
On 7 October 2001, the U.S. launched military operations in Afghanistan. Airstrikes were reported in Kabul, at the airport, at Kandahar (home of Mullah Omar), and in the city of Jalalabad.
On the ground, teams from the CIA's Special Activities Division arrived first. They were soon joined by U.S. Army Special Forces from the 5th Special Forces Group and other units from United States Special Operations Command.
At 17:00 UTC, President Bush confirmed the strikes and Prime Minister Blair addressed his nation. Bush stated that Taliban military sites and terrorist training grounds would be targeted. Food, medicine and supplies would be dropped to "the starving and suffering men, women and children of Afghanistan".
Earlier Bin Laden had released a video in which he condemned all attacks in Afghanistan.
British and American special forces joined the Northern Alliance and other Afghan opposition groups to take Herat in November 2001. Canada and Australia also deployed forces. Other countries provided basing, access and overflight permission.
The U.S. was able to track and kill al-Qaeda's number three, Mohammed Atef with a bomb at his Kabul home between 14–16 November 2001, along with his guard Abu Ali al-Yafi'i and six others.
Air campaigns.
Training camps and Taliban air defenses were bombarded by U.S. aircraft, including Apache helicopter gunships from the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade. U.S. Navy cruisers and destroyers launched several Tomahawk Cruise Missiles.
The strikes initially focused on Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar. Within a few days, most Taliban training sites were severely damaged and air defenses were destroyed. The campaign focused on command, control, and communications targets. The front facing the Northern Alliance held, and no battlefield successes were achieved there. Two weeks into the campaign, the Northern Alliance demanded the air campaign focus more on the front lines.
The next stage began with carrier based F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers hitting Taliban vehicles in pinpoint strikes, while other U.S. planes began cluster bombing Taliban defenses. At the beginning of November, allied forces attacked front lines with daisy cutter bombs and AC-130 gunships.
Taliban fighters had no previous experience with American tactics and often stood on top of exposed ridgelines where U.S. Army Special Forces could easily call in close air support to destroy them. By 2 November, Taliban frontal positions were devastated and a march on Kabul seemed possible. According to author Stephen Tanner,
"After a month of the U.S. bombing campaign rumblings began to reach Washington from Europe, the Mideast, and Pakistan where Musharraf had requested the bombing to cease. Having begun the war with the greatest imaginable reservoir of moral authority, the U.S. was on the verge of letting it slip away through high-level attacks using the most ghastly inventions its scientists could come up with." Bush went to New York City on 10 November 2001 to address the United Nations. He said that not only was the U.S. in danger of further attacks, but so were all other countries in the world. Tanner observed, "His words had impact. Most of the world renewed its support for the American effort, including commitments of material help from Germany, France, Italy, Japan and other countries."
Al-Qaeda fighters took over security in Afghan cities. The Northern Alliance troops planned to seize Mazari-i Sharif, cutting off Taliban supply lines and enabling equipment to arrive from the north and then attack Kabul.
Areas most targeted.
During the early months, the U.S. military had a limited presence on the ground. Special Forces and intelligence officers with a military background liased with Afghan militias and advanced after the Taliban was disrupted by air power.
The Tora Bora Mountains lie roughly east of Kabul, on the Pakistan border. American analysts believed that the Taliban and al-Qaeda had dug in behind fortified networks of caves and underground bunkers. The area was subjected to a heavy B-52 bombardment.
U.S. and Northern Alliance objectives began to diverge. While the U.S. was continuing the search for Osama bin Laden, the Northern Alliance wanted to finish off the Taliban.
Battle of Mazar-i Sharif.
Mazari-i Sharif was important because it is the home of the Shrine of Hazrat Ali or "Blue Mosque", a sacred Muslim site and because it is a significant transportation hub with two major airports and a major supply route leading into Uzbekistan. Taking the city would enable humanitarian aid to alleviate a looming food crisis, which threatened more than six million people with starvation. Many of those in most urgent need lived in rural areas to the south and west of Mazar-i-Sharif. On 9 November 2001, Northern Alliance forces, under the command of Dostum and Ustad Atta Mohammed Noor, overcame resistance crossing the Pul-i-Imam Bukhri bridge, and seized the city's main military base and airport.
U.S. Special Forces Operational Detachment A-595, CIA paramilitary officers and United States Air Force Combat Control Team on horseback and with close air support, took part in the push into Mazari Sharif. After a bloody 90-minute battle, Taliban forces withdrew after holding the city since 1998, triggering celebrations.
The fall of the city was a "body blow" to the Taliban and ultimately proved to be a "major shock", since the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) had originally believed that the city would remain in Taliban hands well into the following year and any potential battle would require "a very slow advance".
Following rumors that Mullah Dadullah was headed to recapture the city with as many as 8,000 fighters, a thousand American 10th Mountain Division personnel were airlifted into the city, providing the first solid position from which Kabul and Kandahar could be reached. While prior military flights had to be launched from Uzbekistan or aircraft carriers in the Arabian Sea, the Americans now had an airport that allowed them to fly more sorties for resupply missions and humanitarian aid. These missions allowed shipments of humanitarian aid to be immediately shipped to Afghans facing starvation on the northern plain.
American-backed forces began immediately broadcasting from "Radio Mazar-i-Sharif", the former Taliban "Voice of Sharia" channel, including an address from former President Rabbani.
Fall of Kabul.
On the night of 12 November, Taliban forces fled Kabul under cover of darkness. Northern Alliance forces arrived the following afternoon, encountering a group of about twenty fighters hiding in the city's park. This group was killed in a 15-minute gun battle. After these forces were neutralized, Kabul was in the hands of coalition forces.
The fall of Kabul started a cascading collapse of Taliban positions. Within 24 hours, all Afghan provinces along the Iranian border had fallen, including Herat. Local Pashtun commanders and warlords had taken over throughout northeastern Afghanistan, including Jalalabad. Taliban holdouts in the north, mainly Pakistani volunteers, fell back to the northern city of Kunduz. By 16 November, the Taliban's last stronghold in northern Afghanistan was under siege. Nearly 10,000 Taliban fighters, led by foreign fighters, continued to resist. By then, the Taliban had been forced back to their heartland in southeastern Afghanistan around Kandahar.
By 13 November, al-Qaeda and Taliban forces, possibly including bin Laden, were concentrating in Tora Bora, southwest of Jalalabad. Nearly 2,000 al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters fortified themselves in positions within bunkers and caves. On 16 November the U.S. began bombing the mountain redoubt. Around the same time, CIA and Special Forces operatives were at work in the area, enlisting local warlords and planning an attack.
Fall of Kunduz.
As the bombardment at Tora Bora grew, the siege of Kunduz was continuing. After nine days of fighting and bombardment, Taliban fighters surrendered to Northern Alliance forces on 25–26 November. Shortly before the surrender, Pakistani aircraft arrived to evacuate intelligence and military personnel who had being aiding the Taliban's fight against the Northern Alliance. The airlift is alleged to have evacuated up to five thousand people, including Taliban and al-Qaeda troops.
Battle of Qala-i-Jangi.
On 25 November, as Taliban prisoners were moved into Qala-I-Janghi fortress near Mazar-I-Sharif, a few Taliban attacked their Northern Alliance guards. This incident triggered a revolt by 300 prisoners, who soon seized the southern half of the medieval fortress, including an armory stocked with small arms and crew-served weapons. Johnny Micheal Spann, an American CIA operative who had been interrogating prisoners, was killed, marking America's first combat death.
The revolt was crushed after seven days of fighting involving a Special Boat Service unit Army Special Forces and Northern Alliance forces. AC-130 gunships and other aircraft provided strafing fire and launched bombs. 86 Taliban survived, and around 50 Northern Alliance soldiers were killed. The revolt was the final combat in northern Afghanistan.
Consolidation: the taking of Kandahar.
By the end of November, Kandahar was the Taleban's last stronghold, and was coming under increasing pressure. Nearly 3,000 tribal fighters, led by Karzai and Gul Agha Sherzai, the governor of Kandahar before the Taliban seized power, pressured Taliban forces from the east and cut off northern supply lines to Kandahar. The Northern Alliance loomed in the north and northeast.
Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 U.S. Marines, ferried in by CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters and C-130s, set up a Forward Operating Base known as Camp Rhino in the desert south of Kandahar on 25 November. This was the coalition's first base, and enabled other operating bases to form. The first significant combat involving U.S. ground forces occurred a day after Rhino was captured, when 15 Taleban armored vehicles approached the base and were attacked by helicopter gunships, destroying many of them. Meanwhile, airstrikes continued to pound Taliban positions inside the city, where Mullah Omar remained. Omar remained defiant although his movement controlled only 4 out of 30 Afghan provinces by the end of November. He called on his forces to fight to the death.
On 6 December, the U.S. government rejected amnesty for Omar or any Taliban leaders. On 7 December, Omar slipped out of Kandahar with a group of loyalists and moved northwest into the mountains of Uruzgan Province, thus reneging on the Taliban's promise to surrender their fighters and their weapons. He was last reported seen leaving in a convoy of motorcycles.
Other Taliban leaders fled to Pakistan through the remote passes of Paktia and Paktika Provinces. The border town of Spin Boldak surrendered on the same day, marking the end of Taliban control in Afghanistan. Afghan forces under Gul Agha seized Kandahar, while the U.S. Marines took control of the airport and established a U.S. base.
Battle of Tora Bora.
Al-Qaeda fighters fought on at Tora Bora. A tribal militia steadily pushed bin Laden back across the difficult terrain, backed by Delta Force, UK Special Forces and U.S. air strikes. The al-Qaeda forces agreed to a truce ostensibly to give them time to surrender their weapons. The truce was apparently a ruse to allow bin Laden and others to escape into Pakistan. On 12 December, fighting resumed, probably initiated by a rear guard buying time for the main force's escape through the White Mountains.
By 17 December, the last cave complex had been taken and its defenders overrun. U.S. and U.K. forces continued searching into January, but no sign of al-Qaeda leadership emerged. An estimated 200 al-Qaeda fighters were killed during the battle, along with an unknown number of tribal fighters. No American or British deaths were reported.
Diplomatic and humanitarian efforts.
In December 2001 the United Nations hosted the Bonn Conference. The Taliban were excluded. Four Afghan opposition groups participated. Observers included representatives of neighbouring and other involved major countries.
The resulting Bonn Agreement created the Afghan Interim Authority that would serve as the "repository of Afghan sovereignty" and outlined the so-called Petersberg Process that would lead towards a new constitution and a new Afghan government.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1378 of 14 November 2001, included "Condemning the Taliban for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism by the al-Qaeda network and other terrorist groups and for providing safe haven to Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda and others associated with them, and in this context supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to replace the Taliban regime".
The United Nations World Food Programme temporarily suspended activities within Afghanistan at the beginning of the bombing attacks but resumed them after the fall of the Taliban.
International Security Assistance Force.
The United Nations authorized an international force –the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) – with a mandate to help the Afghans maintain security in Kabul and surrounding areas. Operating under U.S. General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., ISAF included soldiers from 46 countries, with U.S. troops making up about half its force. ISAF was initially established as a stabilization force by the UN Security Council on 20 December 2001, to secure Kabul. Its mandate did not extend beyond this area for the first few years. On 11 August 2003, NATO assumed political command and coordination of ISAF. On 31 July 2006, ISAF assumed command of the south of the country, and by 5 October 2006, of the east.
2002: Operation Anaconda.
Following Tora Bora, coalition forces consolidated their position. Following a Loya jirga, tribal leaders and former exiles established an interim government in Kabul under Hamid Karzai. U.S. forces established their main base at Bagram airbase just north of Kabul. Kandahar airport also became an important U.S. base. Outposts were established in eastern provinces to hunt for Taliban and al-Qaeda fugitives.
Al-Qaeda forces began regrouping in the Shahi-Kot mountains of Paktia province southeast of Gardez throughout January and February 2002. A Taliban fugitive in Paktia province, Mullah Saifur Rehman began reconstituting some of his militia forces. They totalled over 1,000 by the beginning of March 2002. The intention of the insurgents was to use the region to launch guerrilla attacks and possibly a major offensive, copying 1980s anti-Soviet fighters.
Coalition sources soon picked up on this buildup. On 2 March 2002, U.S. and Afghan forces launched an offensive, dubbed Operation Anaconda. Mujahideen forces, using small arms, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars, were entrenched into caves and bunkers in the hillsides largely above .
They used "hit and run" tactics, opening fire and then retreating to their caves and bunkers to weather the return fire and bombing. U.S. commanders initially estimated their opponents as an isolated pocket numbering fewer than 200. Instead the guerrillas numbered between 1,000–5,000, according to some estimates, later receiving reinforcements.
By 6 March, eight American and seven Afghan soldiers had been killed and reportedly 400 opposing forces had been killed. The coalition casualties stemmed from a friendly fire incident that killed one soldier, the downing of two helicopters by rocket-propelled grenades, small arms fire that killed seven soldiers, and the pinning down of U.S. forces targeting "Objective Ginger" that resulted in dozens of wounded. Several hundred guerrillas escaped to the tribal areas in Waziristan.
During Operation Anaconda and other missions during 2002 and 2003, special forces from several western nations were also involved in operations. These included the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, the Canadian Joint Task Force 2, the German KSK, the New Zealand Special Air Service and Norwegian Marinejegerkommandoen.
Post-Anaconda operations.
Following the battle at Shahi-Kot, al-Qaeda fighters established sanctuaries among tribal protectors in Pakistan, where they regrouped and launched cross-border raids beginning in the summer of 2002. Guerrilla units, numbering between 5 and 25 men, regularly crossed the border to fire rockets at coalition bases, ambush convoys and patrols and assault non-governmental organizations. The area around the Shkin base in Paktika province saw some of the heaviest activity.
Meanwhile, Taliban forces remained in hiding in the rural regions of the four southern provinces that formed their heartland: Kandahar, Zabul, Helmand and Uruzgan. After Anaconda the Pentagon requested British Royal Marines, highly trained in mountain warfare, to be deployed. They conducted missions over several weeks with varying results. The Taliban, who during the summer of 2002 numbered in the hundreds, avoided combat and hid in caves and tunnels or in Pakistan during operations.
2003–2005: Insurgency.
After evading coalition forces throughout mid-2002, Taliban remnants gradually regained confidence and prepared to launch the insurgency that Omar had promised. During September, Taliban forces began a jihad recruitment drive in Pashtun areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pamphlets distributed in secret appeared in many villages in southeastern Afghanistan called for jihad.
Small mobile training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to Afghan sources and a United Nations report. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. The will of the Pakistani paramilitaries stationed at border crossings to prevent such infiltration was questioned, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use.
The Taliban established a new mode of operation, gathering into groups of around 50 to launch attacks on isolated outposts, and then breaking up into groups of 5–10 to evade counterattacks. Coalition forces were attacked indirectly, through rocket attacks on bases and improvised explosive devices.
To coordinate the strategy, Omar named a 10-man leadership council, with himself as its leader. Five operational zones were assigned to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. Al-Qaeda forces in the east had a bolder strategy of attacking Americans using elaborate ambushes.
The first sign of the strategy came on 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose, when a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex north of Spin Boldak. 18 rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time.
As the summer continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, non-governmental organization and humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province.
Dai Chopan is a remote and sparsely populated area composed of tall mountains interspersed with narrow gorges. Taliban fighters decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003.
In late August 2005, Afghan government forces backed by U.S. troops and aerial bombardment advanced upon Taliban positions. After a one-week battle, Taliban forces were routed with up to 124 fighters killed.
2006: Southern Afghanistan.
From January 2006, a multinational ISAF contingent started to replace U.S. troops in southern Afghanistan. The British 16th Air Assault Brigade (later reinforced by Royal Marines) formed the core of the force, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,300 Canadian, 1,963 Dutch, 300 Australian, 290 Danish and 150 Estonian troops. Air support was provided by U.S., British, Dutch, Norwegian and French combat aircraft and helicopters.
In January 2006, NATO's focus in southern Afghanistan was to form Provincial Reconstruction Teams with the British leading in Helmand while the Netherlands and Canada would lead similar deployments in Orūzgān and Kandahar, respectively. Local Taliban figures pledged to resist.
Southern Afghanistan faced in 2006 the deadliest violence since the Taliban's fall. NATO operations were led by British, Canadian and Dutch commanders. Operation Mountain Thrust was launched on 17 May 2006, with. In July, Canadian Forces, supported by U.S., British, Dutch and Danish forces, launched Operation Medusa.
A combined force of Dutch and Australians launched a successful offensive between late April to mid July 2006 to push the Taliban out of the Chora and Baluchi areas.
On 18 September 2006 Italian special forces of Task Force 45 and airborne troopers of the 'Trieste' infantry regiment of the Rapid Reaction Corps composed of Italian and Spanish forces, took part in 'Wyconda Pincer' operation in the districts of Bala Buluk and Pusht-i-Rod, in Farah province. Italian forces killed at least 70 Taliban. The situation in RC-W then deteriorated. Hotspots included Badghis in the very north and Farah in the southwest.
Further NATO operations included the Battle of Panjwaii, Operation Mountain Fury and Operation Falcon Summit. NATO achieved tactical victories and area denial, but the Taliban were not completely defeated. NATO operations continued into 2007.
2007: Coalition offensive.
In January and February 2007, British Royal Marines mounted Operation Volcano to clear insurgents from firing points in the village of Barikju, north of Kajaki. Other major operations during this period were Operation Achilles (March – May) and Operation Lastay Kulang. The UK ministry of defence announced its intention to bring British troop levels in the country up to 7,700 (committed until 2009). Further operations, such as Operation Silver and Operation Silicon, were conducted to keep up the pressure on the Taliban in the hopes of blunting their expected spring offensive.
On 4 March 2007, at least 12 civilians were killed and 33 were injured by U.S. Marines in Shinwar district, Nangrahar, as the Americans reacted to a bomb ambush. The event became known as the Shinwar Massacre. The 120 member Marine unit responsible for the attack was asked to leave the country, because the incident damaged the unit's relations with the local Afghan population.
Later in March 2007, the US added more than 3,500 troops.
On 12 May 2007, ISAF forces killed Mullah Dadullah. Eleven other Taliban fighters were killed in the same firefight.
During the summer, NATO forces achieved tactical victories at the Battle of Chora in Orūzgān, where Dutch and Australian ISAF forces were deployed.
On 16 August, eight civilians including a pregnant woman and a baby died when Polish soldiers shelled the village of Nangar Khel, Paktika Province. Seven soldiers have been charged with war crimes.
On 28 October about 80 Taliban fighters were killed in a 24 hour battle with in Helmand. During the last days of October, Canadian forces surrounded around 300 militants near Arghandab and killed at least 50 of them. This was said to have stopped a Taliban offensive on Kandahar.
The strength of Taliban forces was estimated by Western officials and analysts at about 10,000 fighters fielded at any given time. Of that number, only 2,000 to 3,000 were highly motivated, full-time insurgents. The rest were part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghans, angered by bombing raids or in return for money. In 2007, more foreign fighters came than ever before, according to officials. Approximately 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China. They were reportedly more fanatical and violent, often bringing superior video production or bombmaking expertise.
On 2 November security forces killed a top-ranking militant, Mawlawi Abdul Manan, after he was caught crossing the border. The Taliban confirmed his death. On 10 November the Taliban ambushed a patrol in eastern Afghanistan. This attack brought the U.S. death toll for 2007 to 100, making it the American's deadliest year.
The Battle of Musa Qala took place in December. Afghan units were the principal fighting force, supported by British forces. Taliban forces were forced out of the town.
2008: Reassessment and renewed commitment.
Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that while the situation in Afghanistan is "precarious and urgent", the 10,000 additional troops needed there would be unavailable "in any significant manner" unless withdrawals from Iraq are made. However, Mullen stated that "my priorities . . . given to me by the commander in chief are: Focus on Iraq first. It's been that way for some time. Focus on Afghanistan second."
In the first five months of 2008, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan increased by over 80% with a surge of 21,643 more troops, bringing the total from 26,607 in January to 48,250 in June. In September 2008, President Bush announced the withdrawal of over 8,000 from Iraq and a further increase of up to 4,500 in Afghanistan.
In June 2008, British prime minister Gordon Brown announced the number of British troops serving in Afghanistan would increase to 8,030 – a rise of 230. The same month, the UK lost its 100th serviceman.
On 13 June, Taliban fighters demonstrated their ongoing strength, liberating all prisoners in Kandahar jail. The operation freed 1200 prisoners, 400 of whom were Taliban prisoners of war, causing a major embarrassment for NATO.
On 13 July 2008, a coordinated Taliban attack was launched on a remote NATO base at Wanat in Kunar province. On 19 August, French troops suffered their worst losses in Afghanistan in an ambush. Later in the month, an airstrike targeted a Taliban commander in Herat province and killed 90 civilians.
Late August saw one of NATO's largest operations in Helmand, Operation Eagle's Summit, aiming to bring electricity to the region.
On 3 September, the war spilled onto Pakistani territory for the first time when heavily armed commandos, believed to be U.S. Army Special Forces, landed by helicopter and attacked three houses close to a known enemy stronghold. The attack killed between seven and twenty people. Local residents claimed that most of the dead were civilians. Pakistan condemned the attack, calling the incursion "a gross violation of Pakistan's territory".
On 6 September, in an apparent reaction, Pakistan announced an indefinite disconnection of supply lines.
On 11 September, militants killed two U.S. troops in the east. This brought the total number of U.S. losses to 113, more than in any prior year. Several European countries set their own records, particularly the UK, who suffered 108 casualties.
Taliban attacks on supply lines.
In November and December 2008, multiple incidents of major theft, robbery, and arson attacks afflicted NATO supply convoys in Pakistan. Transport companies south of Kabul were extorted for money by the Taliban. These incidents included the hijacking of a NATO convoy carrying supplies in Peshawar, the torching of cargo trucks and Humvees east of the Khyber pass and a half-dozen raids on NATO supply depots near Peshawar that destroyed 300 cargo trucks and Humvees in December 2008.
Issues with Pakistan.
An unnamed senior Pentagon official told the BBC that at some point between 12 July and 12 September 2008, President Bush issued a classified order authorizing raids against militants in Pakistan. Pakistan said it would not allow foreign forces onto its territory and that it would vigorously protect its sovereignty. In September, the Pakistan military stated that it had issued orders to "open fire" on American soldiers who crossed the border in pursuit of militant forces.
On 25 September 2008, Pakistani troops fired on ISAF helicopters. This caused confusion and anger in the Pentagon, which asked for a full explanation into the incident and denied that American helicopters were in Pakistani airspace. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was quick to deny that shots were fired, insisting that the troops shot flares to warn the Americans that they were in Pakistani airspace.
A further split occurred when American troops apparently landed on Pakistani soil to carry out an operation against militants in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. 'Pakistan reacted angrily to the action, saying 20 innocent villagers had been killed by US troops'. However, despite tensions, the U.S. increased the use of remotely piloted drone aircraft in Pakistan's border regions, in particular the Federally Administered Tribal Regions (FATA) and Balochistan; as of early 2009, drone attacks were up 183% since 2006.
By the end of 2008, the Taliban apparently had severed remaining ties with al-Qaeda. According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials, perhaps fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remained in Afghanistan.
In a meeting with General Stanley McChrystal, Pakistani military officials urged international forces to remain on the Afghan side of the border and prevent militants from fleeing into Pakistan. Pakistan noted that it had deployed 140,000 soldiers on its side of the border to address militant activities, while the coalition had only 100,000 soldiers to police the Afghanistan side.
2009: Southern Afghanistan.
Northern Distribution Network.
In response to the increased risk of sending supplies through Pakistan, work began on the establishment of a Northern Distribution Network (NDN) through Russia and Central Asian republics. Initial permission to move supplies through the region was given on 20 January 2009, after a visit to the region by General David Petraeus. The first shipment along the NDN route left on 20 February from Riga, Latvia, then traveled to the Uzbek town of Termez on the Afghanistan border. In addition to Riga, other European ports included Poti, Georgia and Vladivostok, Russia. U.S. commanders hoped that 100 containers a day would be shipped along the NDN. By comparison, 140 containers a day were typically shipped through the Khyber Pass. By 2011, the NDN handled about 40% of Afghanistan-bound traffic, versus 30% through Pakistan.
On 11 May 2009, Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov announced that the airport in Navoi, Uzbekistan was being used to transport non-lethal cargo into Afghanistan. Due to the still unsettled relationship between Uzbekistan and the U.S. following the 2005 Andijon massacre and subsequent expulsion of U.S. forces from Karshi-Khanabad airbase, U.S. forces were not involved in the shipments. Instead, South Korea's Korean Air, which overhauled Navoi's airport, officially handled logistics.
Originally only non-lethal resources were allowed on the NDN. In July 2009, however, shortly before a visit by new President Barack Obama to Moscow, Russian authorities announced that U.S. troops and weapons could use the country's airspace to reach Afghanistan.
Human rights advocates were concerned that the U.S. was again working with the government of Uzbekistan, which is often accused of violating human rights. U.S. officials promised increased cooperation with Uzbekistan, including further assistance to turn Navoi into a regional distribution center for both military and civilian ventures.
Azerbaijan, which sent peacekeeping forces as part of ISAF, also provided airspace and airports. Over one-third of all of the nonlethal equipment including fuel, clothing, and food used by the U.S. military in Afghanistan traveled through Baku at one point.
Increase in U.S. troops.
In January, about 3,000 U.S. soldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division moved into the provinces of Logar and Wardak. Afghan Federal Guards fought alongside them. The troops were the first wave of an expected surge of reinforcements originally ordered by President Bush and increased by President Obama.
In mid-February, it was announced that 17,000 additional troops would be deployed in two brigades and support troops; the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade of about 3,500 and the 5th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, a Stryker Brigade with about 4,000. U.S. commander General McKiernan had called for as many as 30,000 additional troops, effectively doubling the number of troops.
On 23 September, a classified assessment by General McChrystal included his conclusion that a successful counterinsurgency strategy would require 500,000 troops and five years.
In November, Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry sent two classified cables to Washington expressing concerns about sending more troops before the Afghan government demonstrates that it is willing to tackle the corruption and mismanagement that has fueled the Taliban's rise. Eikenberry, a retired three-star general who in 2006–2007 commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan, also expressed frustration with the relative paucity of funds set aside for development and reconstruction. In subsequent cables, Eikenberry repeatedly cautioned that deploying sizable American reinforcements would result in "astronomical costs" – tens of billions of dollars – and would only deepen the Afghan government's dependence on the United States.
On 26 November, Karzai made a public plea for direct negotiations with the Taliban leadership. Karzai said there is an "urgent need" for negotiations and made it clear that the Obama administration had opposed such talks. There was no formal American response.
On 1 December, Obama announced at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point that the U.S. would send 30,000 more troops. Antiwar organizations in the U.S. responded quickly, and cities throughout the U.S. saw protests on 2 December. Many protesters compared the decision to deploy more troops in Afghanistan to the expansion of the Vietnam War under the Johnson administration.
Kunduz airstrike.
On 4 September, during the Kunduz Province Campaign a devastating NATO air raid was conducted 7 kilometres southwest of Kunduz where Taliban fighters had hijacked civilian supply trucks, killing up to 179 people, including over 100 civilians.
Operation Khanjar and Operation Panther's Claw.
On 25 June American officials announced the launch of Operation Khanjar ("strike of the sword"). About 4000 U.S. Marines from the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and 650 Afghan soldiers participated. Khanjar followed a British-led operation named Operation Panther's Claw in the same region. Officials called it the Marines' largest operation since the 2004 invasion of Fallujah, Iraq. Operation Panther's Claw was aimed to secure various canal and river crossings to establish a long-term ISAF presence.
Initially, Afghan and American soldiers moved into towns and villages along the Helmand River to protect the civilian population. The main objective was to push into insurgent strongholds along the river. A secondary aim was to bring security to the Helmand Valley in time for presidential elections, set to take place on 20 August.
Taliban's gains.
According to a 22 December briefing by Major General Michael T. Flynn, the top U.S. intelligence officer in Afghanistan, "The Taliban retains required partnerships to sustain support, fuel legitimacy and bolster capacity." The 23-page briefing states that "Security incidents [are projected to be higher in 2010." Those incidents were already up by 300 percent since 2007 and by 60 percent since 2008, according to the briefing. NATO intelligence at the time indicated that the Taliban had as many as 25,000 dedicated soldiers, almost as many as before 9/11 and more than in 2005.
On 10 August McChrystal, newly appointed as U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that the Taliban had gained the upper hand. In a continuation of the Taliban's usual strategy of summer offensives, the militants aggressively spread their influence into north and west Afghanistan and stepped up their attack in an attempt to disrupt presidential polls. Calling the Taliban a "very aggressive enemy", he added that the U.S. strategy was to stop their momentum and focus on protecting and safeguarding Afghan civilians, calling it "hard work".
The Taliban's claim that the over 135 violet incidents disrupting elections was largely disputed. However, the media was asked to not report on any violent incidents. Some estimates reported voter turn out as much less than the expected 70 percent. In southern Afghanistan where the Taliban held the most power, voter turnout was low and sporadic violence was directed at voters and security personnel. The chief observer of the European Union election mission, General Philippe Morillon, said the election was "generally fair" but "not free".
Western election observers had difficulty accessing southern regions, where at least 9 Afghan civilians and 14 security forces were killed in attacks intended to intimidate voters. The Taliban released a video days after the elections, filming on the road between Kabul and Kandahar, stopping vehicles and asking to see their fingers. The video went showed ten men who had voted, listening to a Taliban militant. The Taliban pardoned the voters because of Ramadan. The Taliban attacked towns with rockets and other indirect fire. Amid claims of widespread fraud, both top contenders, Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, claimed victory. Reports suggested that turnout was lower than in the prior election.
After Karzai's alleged win of 54 per cent, which would prevent a runoff, over 400,000 Karzai votes had to be disallowed after accusations of fraud. Some nations criticized the elections as "free but not fair".
In December, an attack on Forward Operating Base Chapman, used by the CIA to gather information and to coordinate drone attacks against Taliban leaders, killed at least six CIA officers.
2010: American/British offensive and Afghan peace initiative.
In public statements U.S. officials had previously praised Pakistan's military effort against militants during its offensive in South Waziristan in November 2009. Karzai started peace talks with Haqqani network groups in March 2010. and there were other peace initiatives including the Afghan Peace Jirga 2010. In July 2010, a U.S. Army report read: "It seems to always be this way when we go there meet civilians. No one wants anything to do with us." A report on meeting up with school representatives mentioned students throwing rocks at soldiers and not welcoming their arrival, as had been reported on several occasions elsewhere. President Zardari said that Pakistan had spent over 35 billion U.S. dollars during the previous eight years fighting against militancy. According to the Afghan government, approximately 900 Taliban were killed in operations conducted during 2010. Due to increased use of IEDs by insurgents the number of injured coalition soldiers, mainly Americans, significantly increased. Beginning in May 2010 NATO special forces began to concentrate on operations to capture or kill specific Taliban leaders. As of March 2011, the U.S. military claimed that the effort had resulted in the capture or killing of more than 900 low- to mid-level Taliban commanders. Overall, 2010 saw the most insurgent attacks of any year since the war began, peaking in September at more than 1,500. Insurgent operations increased "dramatically" in two-thirds of Afghan provinces.
Troop surge.
Deployment of additional U.S. troops continued in early 2010, with 9,000 of the planned 30,000 in place before the end of March and another 18,000 expected by June, with the 101st Airborne Division as the main source. U.S. troops in Afghanistan outnumbered those in Iraq for the first time since 2003.
The CIA, following a request by General McChrystal, planned to increase teams of operatives, including elite SAD officers, with U.S. military special operations forces. This combination worked well in Iraq and was largely credited with the success of that surge. The CIA also increased its campaign using Hellfire missile strikes on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan. The number of strikes in 2010, 115, more than doubled the 50 drone attacks that occurred in 2009.
The surge in troops supported a sixfold increase in Special Forces operations. 700 airstrikes occurred in September 2010 alone versus 257 in all of 2009. From July 2010 to October 2010, 300 Taliban commanders and 800 foot soldiers were killed. Hundreds more insurgent leaders were killed or captured as 2010 ended. Petraeus said, "We've got our teeth in the enemy's jugular now, and we're not going to let go."
The CIA created Counter-terrorism Pursuit Teams (CTPT) staffed by Afghans at the war's beginning. This force grew to over 3,000 by 2010 and was considered one of the "best Afghan fighting forces". Firebase Lilley was one of SAD's nerve centers. These units were not only effective in operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces in Afghanistan, but have expanded their operations into Pakistan. They were also important factors in both the "counterterrorism plus" and the full "counter-insurgency" options discussed by the Obama administration in the December 2010 review.
Wikileaks disclosure.
On 25 July 2010, the release of 91,731 classified documents from the Wikileaks organization was made public. The documents cover U.S. military incident and intelligence reports from January 2004 to December 2009. Some of these documents included sanitised, and "covered up", accounts of civilian casualties caused by Coalition Forces. The reports included many references to other incidents involving civilian casualties like the Kunduz airstrike and Nangar Khel incident. The leaked documents also contain reports of Pakistan collusion with the Taliban. According to "Der Spiegel", "the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan."
Pakistan and U.S. tensions.
Tensions between Pakistan and the U.S. were heightened in late September after several Pakistan Frontier Corps soldiers were killed and wounded. The troops were attacked by a U.S. piloted aircraft that was pursuing Taliban forces near the Afghan-Pakistan border, but for unknown reasons opened fire on two Pakistan border posts. In retaliation for the strike, Pakistan closed the Torkham ground border crossing to NATO supply convoys for an unspecified period. This incident followed the release of a video allegedly showing uniformed Pakistan soldiers executing unarmed civilians. After the Torkham border closing, Pakistani Taliban attacked NATO convoys, killing several drivers and destroying around 100 tankers.
2011: U.S. and NATO drawdown.
Battle of Kandahar.
The Battle of Kandahar was part of an offensive named after the Battle of Bad'r that took place on 13 March 624, between Medina and Mecca. The Battle followed an 30 April announcement that the Taliban would launch their Spring offensive.
On 7 May the Taliban launched a major offensive on government buildings in Kandahar. The Taliban said their goal was to take control of the city. At least eight locations were attacked: the governor's compound, the mayor's office, the NDS headquarters, three police stations and two high schools. The battle continued onto a second day. The BBC's Bilal Sarwary called it "the worst attack in Kandahar province since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, and a embarrassment for the Western-backed Afghan government."
Death of Osama bin Laden.
On 2 May U.S. officials announced that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been killed in Operation Neptune Spear, conducted by the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs, in Pakistan. Crowds gathered outside the White House chanting "USA, USA" after the news emerged.
Withdrawal.
On 22 June President Obama announced that 10,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2011 and an additional 23,000 troops would return by the summer of 2012. After the withdrawal of 10,000 U.S. troops, only 80,000 remained. In July 2011 Canada withdrew its combat troops, transitioning to a training role.
Following suit, other NATO countries announced troop reductions. The United Kingdom stated that it would gradually withdraw its troops, however it did not specify numbers or dates.
France announced that it would withdraw roughly 1,000 soldiers by the end of 2012, with 3,000 soldiers remaining. Hundreds would come back at the end of 2011 and in the beginning of 2012, when the Afghan National Army took control of Surobi district. The remaining troops would continue to operate in Kapisa. Their complete withdrawal was expected by the end of 2014 or earlier given adequate security.

Belgium announced that half of their force would withdraw starting in January 2012. Norway announced it had started a withdrawal of its near 500 troops and would be completely out by 2014. Equally, the Spanish Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of troops beginning in 2012, including up to 40 percent by the end of the first half of 2013, and complete withdrawal by 2014.
2011 U.S.–NATO attack in Pakistan.
After Neptune Spear an accidental, direct attack on Pakistan's armed forces by ISAF forces occurred on 26 November, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan blocked NATO supply lines and ordered Americans to leave Shamsi Airfield. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the attack was 'tragic' and 'unintended'. "This (regret) is not good enough. We strongly condemn the attacks and reserve the right to take action," said DG ISPR Major General Athar Abbas. "This could have serious consequences in the level and extent of our cooperation.
2012: Strategic Agreement.
Taliban attacks continued at the same rate as they did in 2011, remaining around 28,000 Taliban "enemy initiated" attacks.</ref>
Reformation of the United Front (Northern Alliance).
In late 2011 the National Front of Afghanistan (NFA) was created by Ahmad Zia Massoud, Abdul Rashid Dostum and Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq in what many analysts have described as a reformation of the military wing of the United Front (Northern Alliance) to oppose a return of the Taliban to power. Meanwhile, much of the political wing reunited under the National Coalition of Afghanistan led by Abdullah Abdullah becoming the main democratic opposition movement in the Afghan parliament. Former head of intelligence Amrullah Saleh has created a new movement, Basej-i Milli (Afghanistan Green Trend), with support among the youth mobilizing about 10,000 people in an anti-Taliban demonstration in Kabul in May 2011.
In January 2012, the National Front of Afghanistan raised concerns about the possibility of a secret deal between the US, Pakistan and the Taliban during a widely publicized meeting in Berlin. U.S. Congressman Louie Gohmert wrote, "These leaders who fought with embedded Special Forces to initially defeat the Taliban represent over 60-percent of the Afghan people, yet are being entirely disregarded by the Obama and Karzai Administrations in negotiations." After the meeting with US congressmen in Berlin the National Front signed a joint declaration stating among other things:
High-profile U.S. military incidents.
Beginning in January 2012 incidents involving US troops occurred which were described by The Sydney Morning Herald as "a series of damaging incidents and disclosures involving American troops in Afghanistan [...]". These incidents created fractures in the partnership between Afghanistan and ISAF, raised the question whether discipline within U.S. troops was breaking down, undermined "the image of foreign forces in a country where there is already deep resentment owing to civilian deaths and a perception among many Afghans that US troops lack respect for Afghan culture and people" and strained the relations between Afghanistan and the United States. Besides an incident involving US troops who posed with body parts of dead insurgents and an video apparently showing a US helicopter crew singing "Bye-bye Miss American Pie" before blasting a group of Afghan men with a Hellfire missile these "high-profile U.S. military incidents in Afghanistan" also included the 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests and the Panjwai shooting spree.
Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement.
On 2 May 2012, Presidents Karzai and Obama signed a strategic partnership agreement between the two countries, after the US president had arrived unanounced in Kabul on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, officially entitled the "Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America", provides the long-term framework for the two countries' relationship after the drawdown of U.S. forces. The Strategic Partnership Agreement went into effect on 4 July 2012, according to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 8 July 2012 at the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan. On 7 July 2012, as part of the agreement, the U.S. designated Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally after Karzai and Clinton met in Kabul. On 11 November 2012, as part of the agreement, the two countries launched negotiations for a bilateral security agreement.
NATO Chicago Summit: Troops withdrawal and long-term presence.
On 21 May 2012 the leaders of NATO-member countries endorsed an exit strategy during the NATO Summit. ISAF Forces would transfer command of all combat missions to Afghan forces by the middle of 2013, while shifting from combat to advising, training and assisting Afghan security forces. Most of the 130,000 ISAF troops would depart by the end of December 2014. A new NATO mission would then assume the support role.
2013: Withdrawal.
Karzai–Obama meeting.
Karzai visited the U.S. in January 2012. At the time the U.S. stated its openness to withdrawing all of its troops by the end of 2014." On January 11, 2012 Karzai and Obama agreed to transfer combat operations from NATO to Afghan forces by spring 2013 rather than summer 2013.
"What's going to happen this spring is that Afghans will be in the lead throughout the country", Obama said. "They forces will still be fighting alongside Afghan troops...We will be in a training, assisting, advising role." "We achieved our central goal, or have come very close...which is to de-capacitate al-Qaeda, to dismantle them, to make sure that they can't attack us again," Obama added.
Obama also stated that he would determine the pace of troop withdrawal after consultations with commanders. He added that any U.S. mission beyond 2014 would focus solely on counterterrorism operations and training. Obama insisted that a continuing presence must include an immunity agreement in which US troops are not subjected to Afghan law. "I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised," Karzai replied.
Both leaders agreed that the United States would transfer Afghan prisoners and prisons to the Afghan government and withdraw troops from Afghan villages in spring 2013. "The international forces, the American forces, will be no longer present in the villages, that it will be the task of the Afghan forces to provide for the Afghan people in security and protection," the Afghan president said.
Security transfer.
On June 18, 2013 the transfer of security responsibilities was completed. The last step was to transfer control of 95 remaining districts. Karzai said, "When people see security has been transferred to Afghans, they support the army and police more than before." NATO leader Rasmussen said that Afghan forces were completing a five-stage transition process that began in March 2011. "They are doing so with remarkable resolve," he said. "Ten years ago, there were no Afghan national security forces ... now you have 350,000 Afghan troops and police." ISAF remained slated to end its mission by the end of 2014. Some 100,000 ISAF forces remained in the country.
U.S.–Afghanistan Bilateral Security agreement.
As part of the U.S.–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement the United States and Afghanistan reached an agreement on a bilateral security agreement, on November 20, 2013. If approved, the agreement would allow the U.S. to deploy military advisors to train and equip Afghan security forces, along with U.S. special-operations troops for anti-terrorism missions against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. President Obama will determine the size of the force.
2014-Withdrawal plans and renewed increasing fighting.
Withdrawal Plans.
The new year of 2014 is a busy year for the Afghan government. President Hamid Karzai will have to sign a form for UK troops to leave Afghanistan; followed by US forces leaving. The UK'S biggest base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion, will be sold to the Afghan army and troops who are in Afghanistan will withdraw, leaving none left by the end of 2013.
Post-2014 presence plans for NATO and the United States.
NATO and the United States are as of November/December 2012 planning their precise configuration of their post-2014 presence.
Impact on Afghan society.
Civilian casualties.
Castually estimates for specific years or periods have been published by multiple organizations. According to a UN report, the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009. A UN report in June 2011 stated that 2,777 civilians were known to have been killed in 2010, (insurgents responsible for 75%). A July 2011 UN report said "1,462 non-combatants died" in the first six months of 2011 (insurgents 80%). In 2011 a record 3,021 civilians were killed, the fifth successive annual rise. 60% of Afghans have direct personal experience and most others report suffering a range of hardships. 96% have been affected either personally or from the wider consequences.
However, according to Nicholas Kristoff, improved healthcare resulting from the war has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
Refugees.
Since 2001, more than 5.7 million former refugees have returned to Afghanistan, but 2.2 million others remained refugees in 2013. In January, 2013 the UN estimated that 547,550 were internally displaced persons, a 25% increase over the 447,547 IDPs estimated for January, 2012Afghan refugees abandoned by their own government, report finds: About half a million Afghans who fled homes because of violence are living in desperate conditions, says Amnesty, The Guardian, Thursday 23 February 2012</ref>
Drug trade.
From 1996-1999, the Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan's poppy fields and made opium its largest source of revenue. Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income. According to Rashid, "drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war." In "The New York Times", the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they "appeared to spend US$ 300 million a year, nearly all of it on war". He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: "poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden".
By 2000 Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's opium supply and in 2000 produced an estimated 3276 tonnes from . Omar then banned opium cultivation and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from . Some observers say the ban - which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations - was issued only to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles. 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest. The trafficking of accumulated stocks continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the UN mentioned the "existence of significant stocks of opiated accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests". In September 2001 - before the 11 September attacks against the U.S. – the Taliban allegedly authorized Afghan peasants to sow opium again.
Soon after the invasion opium production increased markedly. By 2005, Afghanistan was producing 90% of the world's opium, most of which was processed into heroin and sold in Europe and Russia. In 2009, the BBC reported that "UN findings say an opium market worth $65bn (£39bn) funds global terrorism, caters to 15 million addicts, and kills 100,000 people every year".
Public education.
As of 2013, 8.2 million Afghans attended school, including 3.2 million girls, up from 1.2 million in 2001, including fewer than 50,000 girls.
War crimes.
War crimes (a serious violation of the laws and customs of war giving rise to individual criminal responsibility) have been committed by both sides, including civilian massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, use of torture and the murder of prisoners of war. Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and the destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.
Taliban.
In 2011 "The New York Times" reported that the Taliban was responsible for 3/4 of all civilian deaths in the War in Afghanistan. In 2013 the UN stated that the Taliban had been placing bombs along transit routes.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for attacks on various civilian targets such as markets, aid workers, hotels and schools.
Northern Alliance.
In December 2001 the Dasht-i-Leili massacre took place, where between 250 and 3,000 Taliban fighters who had surrendered, were shot and/or suffocated to death in metal truck containers during transported by Northern Alliance forces. Reports place U.S. ground troops at the scene. The Irish documentary Afghan Massacre - the Convoy of Death investigated these allegations and claimed that mass graves of thousands of victims were found by UN investigators and that the US blocked investigations into the incident.
Coalition.
On June 21, 2003, David Passaro, a CIA contractor and former United States Army Ranger, killed Abdul Wali, a prisoner at a U.S. base 10 miles south of Asadabad, in Kunar Province. Passaro was found guilty of one count of felony assault with a dangerous weapon and three counts of misdemeanor assault. On August 10, 2009, he was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months in prison.
In 2005, "The New York Times" obtained a 2,000-page United States Army report concerning the homicides of two unarmed civilian Afghan prisoners by U.S. armed forces in 2002 at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility (also "Bagram Collection Point" or "B.C.P.") in Bagram, Afghanistan. The prisoners, Habibullah and Dilawar, were chained to the ceiling and beaten, which caused their deaths. Military coroners ruled that both the prisoners' deaths were homicides. Autopsies revealed severe trauma to both prisoners' legs, describing the trauma as comparable to being run over by a bus. Fifteen soldiers were charged.
During the summer of 2010, ISAF charged five United States Army soldiers with the murder of three Afghan civilians in Kandahar province and collecting their body parts as trophies in what came to be known as the Maywand District murders. In addition, seven soldiers were charged with crimes such as hashish use, impeding an investigation and attacking the whistleblower, Specialist Justin Stoner. Eleven of the twelve soldiers were convicted on various counts.
A British Royal Marine Sergeant, identified as Sergeant Alexander Blackman from Taunton, Somerset, was convicted at court martial in Wiltshire of having murdered an unarmed, reportedly wounded Afghan fighter in Helmand Province in September 2011. On 6 December 2013, Sergeant Blackman received a life sentence, with a minimum of ten years before he is eligible for parole, from the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire. Furthermore he has been dismissed with disgrace from the Royal Marines.
On March 11, 2012, the Kandahar massacre occurred when sixteen civilians were killed and six wounded in the Panjwayi District of Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. Nine of the victims were children, and eleven of the dead were from the same family. United States Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales was taken into custody and charged with sixteen counts of premeditated murder. After pleading guilty to sixteen counts of premeditated murder, Bales was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
Costs.
The cost of the war reportedly was a major factor as U.S. officials considered drawing down troops in 2011. A March 2011 Congressional Research Service report noted, 1) following the Afghanistan surge announcement in 2009, Defense Department spending on Afghanistan increased by 50%, going from $4.4 billion to $6.7 billion a month. During that time, troop strength increased from 44,000 to 84,000, and was expected to be at 102,000 for fiscal year 2011; 2) The total cost from inception to the fiscal year 2011 was expected to be $468 billion. The estimate for the cost of deploying one U.S. soldier in Afghanistan is over US$1 million a year.
Stability challenges.
In a 2008 interview, the then-head U.S. Central Command General David H. Petraeus, insisted that the Taliban were gaining strength. He cited a recent uptick in attacks in Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan. Petraeus insisted that the challenges in Afghanistan were more complicated than the ones he had faced in Iraq during his tour and required removing widespread sanctuaries and strongholds.
Observers have argued that the mission in Afghanistan is hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on the country instead of the region.
In 2009, Afghanistan moved three places in Transparency International's annual index of corruption, becoming the world's second most-corrupt country ahead of just Somalia. In the same month, Malalai Joya, a former member of the Afghan Parliament and the author of "Raising My Voice", expressed opposition to an expansion of the U.S. military presence and her concerns about the future. "Eight years ago, the U.S. and NATO – under the banner of women's rights, human rights, and democracy – occupied my country and pushed us from the frying pan into the fire. Eight years is enough to know better about the corrupt, mafia system of President Hamid Karzai. My people are crushed between two powerful enemies. From the sky, occupation forces bomb and kill civilians ... and on the ground, the Taliban and warlords continue their crimes. It is better that they leave my country; my people are that fed up. Occupation will never bring liberation, and it is impossible to bring democracy by war."
Pakistan plays a central role in the conflict. A 2010 report published by the London School of Economics says that Pakistan's ISI has an "official policy" of support to the Taliban. "Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude," the report states. Amrullah Saleh, former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, stated, "We talk about all these proxies Haqqanis but not the master of proxies, which is the Pakistan army. The question is what does Pakistan's army want to achieve ...? They want to gain influence in the region" About the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan he stated: "fight for the U.S. national interest but ... without them we will face massacre and disaster and God knows what type of a future Afghanistan will have."

Afghan security forces.
Afghan National Army.
U.S. policy called for boosting the Afghan National Army to 134,000 soldiers by October 2010. By May 2010 the Afghan Army had accomplished this interim goal and was on track to reach its ultimate number of 171,000 by 2011. This increase in Afghan troops allowed the U.S. to begin withdrawing American forces in July 2011.
In 2010, the Afghan National Army had limited fighting capacity. Even the best Afghan units lacked training, discipline and adequate reinforcements. In one new unit in Baghlan Province, soldiers had been found cowering in ditches rather than fighting. Some were suspected of collaborating with the Taliban. "They don't have the basics, so they lay down," said Capt. Michael Bell, who was one of a team of U.S. and Hungarian mentors tasked with training Afghan soldiers. "I ran around for an hour trying to get them to shoot, getting fired on. I couldn't get them to shoot their weapons." In addition, 9 out of 10 soldiers in the Afghan National Army were illiterate.
The Afghan Army was plagued by inefficiency and endemic corruption. U.S. training efforts were drastically slowed by the problems. U.S. trainers reported missing vehicles, weapons and other military equipment, and outright theft of fuel. Death threats were leveled against U.S. officers who tried to stop Afghan soldiers from stealing. Afghan soldiers often snipped the command wires of IEDs instead of marking them and waiting for U.S. forces to come to detonate them. This allowed insurgents to return and reconnect them. U.S. trainers frequently removed the cell phones of Afghan soldiers hours before a mission for fear that the operation would be compromised. American trainers often spent large amounts of time verifying that Afghan rosters were accurate – that they are not padded with "ghosts" being "paid" by Afghan commanders who stole the wages.
Desertion was a significant problem. One in every four combat soldiers quit the Afghan Army during the 12-month period ending in September 2009, according to data from the U.S. Defense Department and the Inspector General for Reconstruction in Afghanistan.
Afghan National Police.
The Afghan National Police provides support to the Afghan army. Police officers in Afghanistan are also largely illiterate. Approximately 17 percent of them tested positive for illegal drugs in 2010. They were widely accused of demanding bribes. Attempts to build a credible Afghan police force were faltering badly, according to NATO officials. A quarter of the officers quit every year, making the Afghan government's goals of substantially building up the police force even harder to achieve.
Insider attacks.
Beginning in 2011, insurgent forces in Afghanistan began using a tactic of insider attacks on ISAF and Afghan military forces. In the attacks, Taliban personnel or sympathizers belonging to, or pretending to belong to, the Afghan military or police forces attack ISAF personnel, often within the security of ISAF military bases and Afghan government facilities. In 2011, for example, 21 insider attacks killed 35 coalition personnel. Forty-six insider attacks killed 63 and wounded 85 coalition troops, mostly American, in the first 11 months of 2012.
International reactions.
Public opinion in 2001.
When the invasion began in October 2001, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action.
A large-scale 37-nation poll of world opinion carried out by Gallup International in late September 2001 found that large majorities in most countries favored a legal response, in the form of extradition and trial, over a military response to 9/11: only three countries out of the 37 surveyed – the U.S., Israel and India – did majorities favor military action. In the other 34 countries surveyed, the poll found many clear majorities that favored extradition and trial instead of military action: in the United Kingdom (75%), France (67%), Switzerland (87%), Czech Republic (64%), Lithuania (83%), Panama (80%) and Mexico (94%).
An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the U.K. (65%) approved of U.S. airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them.
Development of public opinion.
In a 47-nation June 2007 survey of global public opinion, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found international opposition to the war. Out of the 47 countries surveyed, 4 had a majority that favoured keeping foreign troops: the U.S. (50%), Israel (59%), Ghana (50%), and Kenya (60%). In 41, pluralities wanted NATO troops out as soon as possible. In 32 out of 47, clear majorities wanted war over as soon as possible. Majorities in 7 out of 12 NATO member countries said troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
A 24-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2008 similarly found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries want the U.S. and NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible. Only in three out of the 24 countries – the U.S. (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%) – did public opinion lean more toward keeping troops there until the situation has stabilized.
Following that June 2008 global survey, however, public opinion in Australia and Britain diverged from that in the U.S. Aa majority of Australians and Britons now want their troops home. A September 2008 poll found that 56% of Australians opposed continuation of their country's military involvement. A November 2008 poll found that 68% of Britons wanted their troops withdrawn within the next 12 months.
In the U.S., a September 2008 Pew survey found that 61% of Americans wanted U.S. troops to stay until the situation has stabilized, while 33% wanted them removed as soon as possible. Public opinion was divided over Afghan troop requests: a majority of Americans continued to see a rationale for the use of military force in Afghanistan. A slight plurality of Americans favored troop increases, with 42%–47% favoring some troop increases, 39%–44% wanting reduction, and 7–9% wanting no changes. Just 29% of Democrats favored troop increases while 57% wanted to begin reducing troops. Only 36% of Americans approved of Obama's handling of Afghanistan, including 19% of Republicans, 31% of independents, and 54% of Democrats.
In a December 2009 Pew Research Center poll, only 32 percent of Americans favored increasing U.S. troops in Afghanistan, while 40 percent favored decreasing them. Almost half of Americans, 49 percent, believed that the U.S. should "mind its own business" internationally and let other countries get along the best they can. That figure was an increase from 30 percent who said that in December 2002.
An April 2011 Pew Research Center poll showed little change in American views, with about 50% saying that the effort was going very well or fairly well and only 44% supporting NATO troop presence in Afghanistan.
Afghan opinions.
Polls of Afghans displayed strong opposition to the Taliban and significant support of the American military presence. However the idea of permanent U.S. military bases was not popular in 2005.
According to a May 2009 BBC poll, 69% of Afghans surveyed thought it was at least mostly good that the U.S. military came in to remove the Taliban – a decrease from 87% of Afghans surveyed in 2005. 24% thought it was mostly or very bad – up from 9% in 2005. The poll indicated that 63% of Afghans were at least somewhat supportive of a U.S. military presence in the country – down from 78% in 2005. Just 18% supported increasing the U.S. military's presence, while 44% favored reducing it. 90% of Afghans surveyed opposed the Taliban, including 70% who were strongly opposed. By an 82%–4% margin, people said they preferred the current government to Taliban rule.
In a June 2009 Gallup survey, about half of Afghan respondents felt that additional U.S. forces would help stabilize the security situation in the southern provinces. But opinions varied widely; residents in the troubled South were mostly mixed or uncertain, while those in the West largely disagreed that more U.S. troops would help the situation.
In December 2009, many Afghan tribal heads and local leaders from the south and east called for U.S. troop withdrawals. "I don't think we will be able to solve our problems with military force," said Muhammad Qasim, a Kandahar tribal elder. "We can solve them by providing jobs and development and by using local leaders to negotiate with the Taliban." "If new troops come and are stationed in civilian areas, when they draw Taliban attacks civilians will end up being killed," said Gulbadshah Majidi, a lawmaker and close associate of Mr. Karzai. "This will only increase the distance between Afghans and their government."
In late January 2010, Afghan protesters took to the streets for three straight days and blocked traffic on a highway that links Kabul and Kandahar. The Afghans were demonstrating in response to the deaths of four men in a NATO-Afghan raid in the village of Ghazni. Ghazni residents insisted that the dead were civilians.
Protests, demonstrations and rallies.
The war was been the subject of large protests around the world starting with the large-scale demonstrations in the days leading up to the invasion and every year since. Many protesters consider the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan to be unjustified aggression. The deaths of Afghan civilians caused directly and indirectly by the U.S. and NATO bombing campaigns is a major underlying focus of the protests. In January 2009, Brave New Foundation launched Rethink Afghanistan, a national campaign for non-violent solutions in Afghanistan built around a documentary film by director and political activist Robert Greenwald. Dozens of organizations planned (and eventually held) a national march for peace in Washington, D.C. on 20 March 2010.
Human rights abuses.
Multiple accounts document human rights violations in Afghanistan.
Taliban.
According to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIGRC) called the Taliban's terrorism against the Afghan civilian population a war crime. According to Amnesty International, the Taliban commit war crimes by targeting civilians, including killing teachers, abducting aid workers and burning school buildings. Amnesty International said that up to 756 civilians were killed in 2006 by bombs, mostly on roads or carried by suicide attackers belonging to the Taliban. Some religious leaders have condemned Taliban terrorist attacks and said these kinds of attacks are against Islamic ethics.
NATO has alleged that the Taliban have used civilians as human shields. As an example, NATO pointed to the victims of NATO air strikes in Farah province in May 2009, during which the Afghan government claims up to 150 civilians were killed. NATO stated that it had evidence that the Taliban forced civilians into buildings likely to be targeted by NATO aircraft involved in the battle. US Lieutenant Colonel Greg Julian, a spokesman for General McKiernan, NATO's Afghanistan commander, said of the Taliban's tactics, "This was a deliberate plan by the Taliban to create a civilian casualty crisis. These were not human shields; these were human sacrifices. We have intelligence that points to this." (NATO has not provided this intelligence to the public.) The Taliban committed human rights violations against women in Afghanistan, according to the U.S. State Department.
White phosphorus use.
White phosphorus has been condemned by human rights organizations as cruel and inhumane because it causes severe burns. White phosphorus burns on the bodies of civilians wounded in clashes near Bagram were confirmed. The U.S. claims at least 44 instances in which militants have used white phosphorus in weapons or attacks. In May 2009, the U.S. confirmed that Western military forces in Afghanistan use white phosphorus to illuminate targets or as an incendiary to destroy bunkers and enemy equipment. US forces used white phosphorus to screen a retreat in the Battle of Ganjgal when regular smoke munitions were not available. The Afghan government investigated the use of white phosphorus munitions.

Lemming

Lemmings are small rodents, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. They are subniveal animals, and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.
Description and habitat.
Lemmings weigh from and are about long. They generally have long, soft fur, and very short tails. They are herbivorous, feeding mostly on leaves and shoots, grasses, and sedges in particular, but also on roots and bulbs. At times, they will eat grubs and larvae. Like other rodents, their incisors grow continuously, allowing them to exist on much tougher forage than would normally be possible.
Lemmings do not hibernate through the harsh northern winter. They remain active, finding food by burrowing through the snow and using grasses clipped and stored in advance. They are solitary animals by nature, meeting only to mate and then going their separate ways, but like all rodents, they have a high reproductive rate and can breed rapidly when food is plentiful.
Behavior.
The behavior of lemmings is much the same as that of many other rodents which have periodic population booms and then disperse in all directions, seeking the food and shelter their natural habitats cannot provide. The Norway lemming and brown lemming are two of the few vertebrates which reproduce so quickly that their population fluctuations are chaotic, rather than following linear growth to a carrying capacity or regular oscillations. It is unknown why lemming populations fluctuate with such great variance roughly every four years, before numbers drop to near extinction. Lemming behavior and appearance are markedly different from many other rodents, which are inconspicuously colored and try to conceal themselves from their predators. Lemmings, on the contrary, are conspicuously colored, and behave aggressively towards predators and even human observers. The lemming defense system is thought to be based on aposematism (warning display).
For many years, the population of lemmings was believed to change with the population cycle, but now some evidence suggests their predators' populations, particularly the stoat, may be more closely involved in changing the lemming population.
Misconceptions.
Misconceptions about lemmings go back many centuries. In the 1530s, the geographer Zeigler of Strasbourg proposed the theory that the creatures fell out of the sky during stormy weather (also featured in the folklore of the Inupiat/Yupik at Norton Sound), and then died suddenly when the grass grew in spring. This description was contradicted by the natural historian Ole Worm, who accepted that lemmings could fall out of the sky, but claimed they had been brought over by the wind rather than created by spontaneous generation. Worm first published dissections of a lemming, which showed they are anatomically similar to most other rodents, and the work of Carl Linnaeus proved they had a natural origin.
Lemmings have become the subject of a widely popular misconception that they commit mass suicide when they migrate. It is not a mass suicide, but the result of their migratory behavior. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. Lemmings can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to stretch their physical capability to the limit. This fact, combined with the unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings, gave rise to the misconception.
The misconception of lemming "mass suicide" is long-standing and has been popularized by a number of factors. It was well enough known to be mentioned in "The Marching Morons", a 1951 short story by Cyril M. Kornbluth. In 1955, Disney Studio illustrator Carl Barks drew an Uncle Scrooge adventure comic with the title "The Lemming with the Locket". This comic, which was inspired by a 1953 "American Mercury" article, showed massive numbers of lemmings jumping over Norwegian cliffs. Even more influential was the 1958 Disney film "White Wilderness", which won an Academy Award for Documentary Feature, in which staged footage was shown with lemmings jumping into certain death after faked scenes of mass migration. A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary, "Cruel Camera", found the lemmings used for "White Wilderness" were flown from Hudson Bay to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where they did not jump off the cliff, but were in fact launched off the cliff using a turntable.
This same myth was also used in the Apple Computer 1985 Super Bowl commercial "Lemmings" and the popular 1991 video game "Lemmings", in which the player must stop the lemmings from mindlessly marching over cliffs or into traps. In a 2010 board game by GMT games, "Leaping Lemmings", players must maneuver lemmings across a board while avoiding hazards, and successfully launch them off a cliff. The 1994 short film Aid" portrayed a group of misfits attempting to save lemmings from mass suicide, (a guinea pig was used as a substitute for a lemming). American cartoonist Stephan Pastis's popular comic strip Pearls Before Swine had a few strips starring four lemmings in a humorous gossip and confessions just before they are about to jump over a cliff.
Because of their association with this odd behavior, lemming "suicide" is a frequently used metaphor in reference to people who go along unquestioningly with popular opinion, with potentially dangerous or fatal consequences. This metaphor is seen many times in popular culture, such as in the video game "Lemmings", and in episodes of "Red Dwarf" and Adult Swim's show "Robot Chicken". In the eighth episode of season 1 of Showtime's "The Borgias", the Pope's second son Juan refers to the college of cardinals as lemmings when they flee the Vatican in anticipation of an impending French invasion. The Blink 182 song "Lemmings" also uses this metaphor, as does the unrelated song of the same name by English progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator (from their 1971 album "Pawn Hearts"), and the 1973 stage show "National Lampoon's Lemmings" starring John Belushi and mocking post-Woodstock groupthink.
