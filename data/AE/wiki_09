Pine Bluff (horse)

Pine Bluff (foaled 1989 in Kentucky) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. Bred and raced by John Ed Anthony's Loblolly Stable, he was a son of Danzig and grandson of the 20th Century's most important sire, Northern Dancer. His dam, Rowdy Angel, was a daughter of two-time North American Champion sire Halo.
Early racing career.
Pine Bluff was a promising colt from the day he stepped on the race track in 1991 at age two. In his first attempt at racing, he broke his maiden and won, then he was elevated several levels and was sent straight into graded stakes races. Pine Bluff was shipped to upstate New York where he showed with a third place finish in the grade one Champagne Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. In mid-September 1991 he ran back to finish third again to future Preakness qualifier Agincourt of Nick Zito's stable in the seven furlong grade one Futurity Stakes at Belmont Park. In late October he won the grade three Nashua Stakes over a mile at Belmont under jockey Craig Perret in 1:46.00 flat. Pine Bluff finished the year in late November with a dazzling win in the grade two Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack finishing the mile and one eighth in 1:50.80 also under rider Craig Perret.
At age three Pine Bluff was shipped to Arkansas home of his owner John Ed Anthony and Loblolly Stable (based in Lake Hamilton, Arkansas) to race in the three year-old series held at Oaklawn Park. In mid-February 1992 Pine Bluff started his sophomore campaign by running second in the one mile Southwest Stakes to future Preakness qualifier Big Sur of D. Wayne Lukas's stable. In mid-March he came back and dominated the grade three Rebel Stakes with a win in 1:42.80 for the mile and one sixteenth after obtaining the services of the nation's premier jockey Jerry D. Bailey. In mid-April Pine Bluff won the grade two Arkansas Derby by a neck over Lil E. Tee in a compact field of six. Bailey was again given the riding assignment by trainer Tom Bohannan and won the mile and one eighth derby in 1:49.40 over a fast track.
1992 Triple Crown series.
On the first Saturday in May Loblolly Stable entered Pine Bluff in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Eighteen runners were entered that day but all the buzz centered around one colt that dominated the air waves as the overwhelming favorite, Arazi. In that race Pine Bluff was listed as the third choice at 5-1. Jockey Jerry Bailey chose to ride second choice Technology at 2-1 which allowed his former jockey Craig Perret to pick up the mount on Pine Bluff. As the gates opened up he broke well and settled in fourth going in the turn. Nearing the end of the back stretch Pine Bluff moved into second behind only Dance Floor clocking the first 3/4 of a mile in 1:12.37. Moving into the home stretch Pine Bluff remained a factor in a tight bunch of seven colts. In the last sixteenth of a mile Pine Bluff lack a late response when asked by Perret. Pine Bluff faded to fifth as Lil E. Tee, Casual Lies and Dance Floor finished in the top three places. Odds-on favorite Arazi came in eighth at odds of .90-1.
Two weeks later Pine Bluff's connections had enough confidence to start him in the 1992 Preakness Stakes. Not only did the connections have confidence but so did the public making Pine Bluff the post time favorite at 7-2. After a well publsized round of musical chairs many jockies jumped from one horse to another for the Preakness. In the end Pine Bluff ended up with a new jockey Chris McCarron. Pine Bluff broke slowly from gate four in very close quarters and settled in the middle of a full field of 14 horses in eighth passing the stands for the first time behind leader Big Sur. Around the Club House turn he moved up to sixth as leader Speakerphone finished the first half mile in :46-1/5. Down the back stretch he worked his way to the outside of the field five wide and started advancing on the first flight of horses. He continued his rally at the top of the home stretch pulling up to third. He then brushed with Dance Floor inside the final furlong. Then he wore down the leader Alydeed and beat him at the wire by 3/4 of a length. Pine Bluff's win in the Preakness Stakes proved to be the first of two straight Preakness wins for his trainer, Tom Bohannan and owner Loblolly Stable and John Ed Anthony.
In the final leg of the Triple Crown series, Pine Bluff ran third behind A.P. Indy in the Belmont Stakes but did earn the $1 million bonus paid by Chrysler Corporation to the owner of the horse with the Highest combined Triple Crown finish as part of Triple Crown Bonus Program . Pine Bluff finished with 13 points ahead of both the Derby winner Lil E. Tee with 10 points, Belmont winner A.P. Indy with 10 points and Casual Lies with 8 points.
Retirement.
Pine Bluff's racing career ended only a few weeks after the Belmont, when he took a misstep during a routine training run and tore a ligament in his left foreleg. He finished his racing career with a record of six wins, one second and four third place finishes in 13 total starts for career earnings of $2,255,884. Pine Bluff's "In-the-Money" percentage of 85% (11 of 13 races) ranked him among the top 20 thoroughbreds in history on the date of his retirement. Retired to stud duty, he sired twenty-nine stakes race winners and was pensioned in 2006.

LFG Roland D.I

The LFG Roland D.I was a fighter aircraft produced in Germany during World War I. It was a single-seat aircraft based originally on the Roland C.II two-seat reconnaissance type. It shared its predecessor's unusual design feature of having a deep fuselage that completely filled the interplane gap, but in comparison, the fuselage was much sleeker. While the C.II's appearance had earned the "Walfisch" ("Whale"), the D.I became known as the "Haifisch" ("Shark"). The I-struts that had been used to brace the C.II's wing were replaced by more conventional struts. Other changes to the wing included the removal of stagger from the design and the introduction of slight sweepback.
The prototype flew in July 1916 and was accepted by the Idflieg for military service. Production was interrupted, however, by a fire at the factory after only around twenty machines had been built. When production eventually resumed, it was of the improved Roland D.II.

Isaac McLellan

Isaac McLellan (May 21, 1806-August 20, 1899) was an author and poet, some of whose work has achieved notability by republication in anthologies.
Biography.
Isaac McLellan was born on May 21, 1806, in Portland, Maine, the home town of his lifelong friends, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Nathaniel Parker Willis. 
In early life, his father, Isaac McLellan, moved to Boston, where for many years he was a prominent merchant, distinguished for his integrity and success in business. Willis' parents also moved to Boston, and Willis and McLellan were schooled together at Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts. McLellan went on to Bowdoin College, where he was in the next class to Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Cheever, and other distinguished writers.
Boston life.
In 1826, he returned to Boston, completed a course of legal study, and was admitted to practice in the courts of that city. But literature had more charms for him than clients and briefs, and for many years he contributed, both in prose and poetry, to several magazines and papers published in the city and vicinity, and had the editorial management of two or three of them, including the "Daily Patriot", the "Daily Advertiser" and the "Weekly Pearl", formerly published by Isaac Pray. McLellan was in almost daily intercourse with Willis, at that time editor of the "Boston Monthly Magazine", which took his contributions, as did the "New England Magazine". In this period he wrote three well received volumes of poems, which were published by Allen & Ticknor, Boston. Only one poem in the collection "The Trout Brook", was on a sporting theme, and was picked out for notice by the editor of "Slackwood's Magazine".
The sporting life and Europe.
Yet before literature, and throughout McLelland's life, he had a passion for the gun and the rod which led him to devote the major portion of his later life to the sports of the field and the flood. During college days, he would hunt on Saturdays with a fellow student. His leisure time in Boston was dedicated to the sport of wild-fowl shooting upon the seacoast - this being the principal pastime of many New England sportsmen.
About the year 1840, he went abroad, and passed some two years in Europe. While there he shot and fished in many portions of the continent, and thus added to his critical observation of American game and shooting a practical knowledge of the field-sports of Europe. On his return, be gave a description of his travels in a series of letters published in the "Boston Daily Courier".
For two years after his return he engaged in agricultural pursuits and the rural life. His passionate love for field-sports, and more especially wild fowl shooting, inspired him to write in prose and verse on sporting subjects; for this work, Willis and other distinguished writers have given McLellan the credit of being in several respects the finest poet in America. Genio C. Scott, who wrote on fly fishing, remarked that "McLellan is as a poet on field-sports what George Pope Morris was as a song-writer both unsurpassed in their way." 
Among the favorite shooting resorts he frequented were Cohasset, Plymouth, and Marshfield, Massachusetts, the latter being the rural home of the statesman, Daniel Webster. Through his courtesy, McLellan passed two seasons at Marshfield, dwelling at one of the farm houses belonging to Webster. Here he had an opportunity of seeing the great sportsman almost daily, enjoying his usual labors and his rambles with rod or gun.
New York life.
In about 1851 McLellan moved to New York City, and there formed the acquaintance of the sporting celebrities of the day, who congregated at the old "Spirit of the Times" office, where William T. Porter presided one of the best-known, and, at that time, the most popular of all the editorial fraternity in the city. Here he met and became friends with the sporting author Henry William Herbert. 
During several years he passed a part of each season on the coast of Virginia and at Currituck Sound, North Carolina, where the water fowl were then very abundant. In later years he followed the sport of duck-shooting at the Shinnecock Inlet and Great South Bay, Long Island, where he has resided for some time, in close proximity to the finest resorts of wild-fowl. 
While in Virginia he contributed a valuable sketch to his friend Genio C. Scott's "Fishing in American Waters", and also supplied the poetical gems in that standard work. In later life he contributed occasionally to the sporting journals of the day - the "Turf, Field and Farm", "Forest and Stream", "American Angler", etc., besides the "Home Journal" and other periodicals of high literary merit. His ardor for field-sports was unquenched by age. His closing years were spent at Greenport, Long Island. Here he died of exhaustion, due to old age, August 20, 1899, aged 93 years, 2 months, and 29 days. He never married.
Poetry.
Many of his later poems, consisting of nearly two hundred pieces, are descriptive of the larger game of Africa and Europe and comprise a valuable fund of sporting lore. They were brought together and published as "Poems of the Rod and Gun; or, Sports by Flood and Field" in 1886, a publication compared to kindred English works such as""The Chase", by William Somervile, and William Watt's "Remarks on Shooting". 
Wendell Phillips held McLellan in high estimation; and various collectors of American poetry, such as Rufus Wilmot Griswold, Cheevers, Kettell, and others, all give his work a place in their pages.
Works.
McLellan's published works include:

Sacred Heart High School (Pennsylvania)

Sacred Heart High School was a Roman Catholic Junior/Senior high school in Carbondale, PA. It was formerly known as St. Rose. By order of Bishop Martino, grades 9–12 were closed in June 2005.
The school’s mascot was the Crusader, and the school’s colors were blue and gold. The school had other mascots in its era: The Hilltoppers and the Roses. The students of the school voted to change the mascot from the Roses to the Crusaders in late 1992.
Early history.
The school opened in 1876 as St. Rose Academy on top of Salem Avenue in Carbondale, Pennsylvania. The school was located at the Brennan Estate, a large Victorian-style mansion at the top of Salem Avenue. At the time, the Brennan Estate also housed the novitiate for the Sisters Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM). In 1902, the novitiate was moved to Marywood in Scranton. Due to rising enrollment, a two story extension was added to the Estate building in 1915, and the school became co-ed in 1926. Eventually, Saint Rose Academy became St. Rose High School and the sisters educated children from grades one through twelve. A school of nursing occupied part of the Estate building, along with the living quarters of the IHM sisters; grades four, five, six, and eight occupied the building on the first floor. The extension housed grades one, two, three and seven on the first floor and grades nine through twelve on the second floor. In 1950, a large, modern school was built on the corner of South Church Street and Seventh Avenue as St. Rose High School. It housed grades kindergarten through 12th grade. As the school continued to grow, a new convent and an Annex building were constructed behind St. Rose of Lima Church and became the new home for the IHM sisters and the school portion housed the primary grades. 
Along with students from Carbondale, the new school attracted students from Archbald, Jermyn, Mayfield, Childs, Simpson, Vandling and Forest City, as well as a small number of students from St. Vincent Elementary located in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. The high school had over 275 students at its peak in the 1956-1957 school year.
In the early years, the school colors were blue and white and after the new school was built in 1950, the colors were changed to royal blue and gold. The years from late 1940s through the 1950s and later in the 1970s were years of basketball excellence for St. Rose.
Consolidation and decline.
In 1977, St. Rose High School was renamed Sacred Heart High School. Mt. Carmel Elementary and St. Rose Elementary were consolidated and renamed as Sacred Heart Elementary for the 2000-2001 school year. Grades PreK-3 were housed in the Mt. Carmel building, while grades 4-6 were moved to the high school and designated as Sacred Heart Intermediate, which mostly operated as a separate entity, not under the jurisdiction of the administration of the high school section. The St. Rose building was vacated and is empty to this day, only being used for Sunday Catechism classes.
Final year.
The 2004-2005 school year was the last operating year for Sacred Heart Intermediate and Sacred Heart High. The newly enstated Bishop Martino decided to close grades 9–12 due to a massive debt and low enrollment. Despite a campaign run by the school which raised the entire $250,000 debt in pledges in a mere two weeks, the bishop's decision remained final, and the school closed in June 2005.

Island I Vow

Eilean I Vow or Eilean a' Bhò (Scottish Gaelic: "Island of the Cow") is a small island in Loch Lomond, in west central Scotland. Other variants of the name include Ellan I Vow, Ellan Vhow and Island I Vow.
It is opposite Rubha Bàn, a point on the mainland, and north of Inveruglas Isle. It is 10 m at its highest point, and 0.08 km long.
The island was a stronghold of Clan MacFarlane, and there are the remains of their castle on it, which was built to replace the one on Inveruglas Isle. In 1710, Buchanan of Auchmar described it as "a pretty good house with gardens".
The etymology of the name may alternatively represent "Eilean a' Bhuth" (island of the shop or store).
Island I Vow ("Ellan Vhow") archaeology and preservation.
Island I Vow is protected by the Scottish Government under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. This site is listed as Scheduled Ancient Monument 11073. The castle is of national and international importance for its historical associations with the MacFarlane chiefs and for the potential of its above and below ground archaeology as a representative example of medieval island strongholds. See the associated Historic Scotland site for more information. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) provides additional archaeological notes and lists Ellan Vhow as an alternate name for the island. These notes reference some of the archaeological work done at the site since 1995 as well as describing the condition of the site and the need for preservation. The Ellan Vhow Preservation Fund has been set up to support archaeological study and preservation of this historic site. Photographs of Ellan Vhow and information on some of the associated preservation works there can be found here.

Pont Gustave-Flaubert

The Pont Gustave-Flaubert (Gustave Flaubert Bridge) is a vertical-lift bridge over the River Seine at Rouen, Seine-Maritime, Haute-Normandie, France. It officially opened on 25 September 2008 after four years of work.
Construction.
It is estimated to have cost 60 million euros to build. Initial groundbreaking work on the bridge began in June 2004. The Rouen city council chose the bridge's name on December 15, 2006. The bridge is named after famous 19th century novelist Gustave Flaubert who was born in Rouen.
The bridge is on the connection between the Normandy motorway (A13), via the RN338, A150 and the motorway which connects with the A29 and A28. This link should help relieve the western districts of Rouen while providing the necessary liaison with the economic zone and the port of Rouen.
Route selection.
Two time of passage of this bond were studied:
time providing for the crossing west of the Seine west of Grand Quevilly
Time is passing east of the Grand and Petit Quevilly Quevilly.
The western zone was abandoned because of its hills and forest in its path. The time is was chosen because it allows a transition to closer neighbourhood centres of Rouen.
Studied solutions for the crossing of the Seine.
Several types of structure are possible to cross the Seine while retaining the possibility for larger boats to access the port of Rouen.
These various solutions have led the client to study a book mobile for the passage of large boats only need 20 to 30 times a year. This type of structure is required to meet the template river throughout the year and the template for the few maritime passages of large boats.
Several solutions drawbridge can be selected:
Features.
At its feet on the right bank, is an old port area undergoing rehabilitation, which includes among others the Maritime Museum and on the left bank, a brownfield site which should result in a large real estate transaction.
This is a lift bridge with a span of 120 m and a total height of 86 m, the third tallest building after the Rouen Cathedral and the Tower of Rouen archives. The air draft is 7 feet when the deck is in the down position, consistent with the passage of barges, and 55 m above the Seine in the upper position. Its features make it the highest lift bridge in the world. It links the A150 north (towards Barentin / Dieppe) to the ring road south of Rouen, which joined the Normandy motorway. Its total length, including viaducts, is 670 m.
Raises butterflies.
The dual deck, each of which is 120 m long and weighing 1,300 tons, is supported by four pylons (arranged in pairs) located in the bed of the Seine. It gets up in twelve minutes, according to forecasts on average thirty times per year, particularly to make way for the sailing of the Armada in Rouen who return periodically and cruise ships that dock in the city centre (near terminal Bridge William the Conqueror).
The market for construction of the bridge is mounted without the viaducts, 60 million euros. It was won in February 2004 by a subsidiary of the Bouygues Group, Rouen society Keel, in association with Eiffel, Eiffage Public Works and the Belgian firm Victor Buyck. The total cost of the operation, with access road, is 137 million euros. The declaration of public 20012 of September.
Work began in June 2004. The installation of "butterflies" at the top of the battery was held on 16 and 17 August 2006, the apron 21 and August 22, 2006.
The design team, which was representative engineering firm Arcadis, included the engineering Eurodim, specialist machinery and Aymeric Zublena, one of the architects of the Stade de France, and Michel Virlogeux, designer Normandy Bridge and the Viaduct of Millau.
The projected traffic is estimated at 50,000 vehicles per day. It is supposed to rid the downtown quarter of 190 000 trucks daily cross the fleuve.

Front View, at the 2008 Armada
Its name, in homage to the writer Gustave Flaubert, was finally chosen December 15, 2006 by the City Council of Rouen, after consultation of the people have to choose between this name, Bridge or Bridge Rouen La Salle ( for the explorer La Salle). Until then, it was temporarily named the sixth bridge.
On 14 April 2007, the barque Belem, docked for a month, went under the bridge Flaubert, after initial tests allowing it to rise enough to let him pass. A crowd of Rouen had then made an appointment to cheer the event.
Reviews.
However, this bridge is already giving rise to a controversy about its usefulness, some believe that the bridge will rise to the occasion of the Armada is about twenty times every four years, the owners did not want their boats take the risk of being retained on the other side of the bridge in case of failure. A new terminal Pleasure has also already been built downstream.

Integra Bank

Integra Bank Corporation was the parent of Integra Bank National Association, a retail bank headquartered in Evansville, Indiana that failed on July 29, 2011. As of March 31, 2010, Integra Bank had $2.9 billion in total assets and operated 67 banking centers and 116 ATMs at locations in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. 
On Friday, July 29, 2011, Integra Bank National Association (N.A.), Evansville, was closed by the Comptroller of the Currency. Subsequently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was named receiver. All deposit accounts, excluding certain brokered deposits, were transferred to Old National Bank. The company then filed for bankruptcy.
A post-mortem audit by the Department of the Treasury found that the bank's decision to actively pursue commercial loans in large cities such as Chicago and Cincinnati was a major contributor to the bank's failure. During its decline through the Great Recession, Integra sold many assets and took more than $83 million in TARP funds. Despite these efforts, in its final full year of operation, Integra lost $124 million.
The company offered a variety of banking services that included commercial, consumer and mortgage loans, lines of credit, transaction accounts, credit cards, letters of credit, corporate cash management services, correspondent banking services, mortgage servicing, annuity products and services, selected insurance products, safe deposit boxes, and personal and corporate trust services.
The bank is not related to the former Integra Bank of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that was bought out by National City in 1995. Coincidentally, Integra was itself once known as National City until adopting the current name in 2000, likely changing it due to the expanding presence of the much larger National City and the two having overlapping territories. Despite PNC Financial Services buying out the larger National City in late 2008, Integra Bank kept the name it has had for nine years.

SouthGate, Bath

SouthGate is a shopping centre in Bath, Somerset, England. It replaced a shopping centre which was demolished in 2007. The new centre developed by Multi Corporation UK is more than double the size of the previous space and provides 37,000 sq metres of retail space, 3,500 sq metres of leisure space, 2,300 sq metres of restaurant space plus 99 residential units. It was designed by Chapman Taylor to mimic Georgian architecture with a Bath stone facade; the infrastructure of the buildings is modern concrete. The owners are the Lend Lease Group.It is home to over 50 shops and 6 restaurants with 860 car park spaces.
History.
On the site prior to this development was the Southgate Shopping Centre designed by Owen Luder, architect of the Tricorn Centre in Portsmouth and Trinity Square Carpark in Gateshead; and, on the east half of the site, the former Bath bus station. The Bath bus station was demolished and a new bus station was opened to the south of the site and just to the west of the main Bath Spa railway station.
The new SouthGate precinct occupies roughly the west half of an area of land once known as The Ham that existed up until around the time of Jane Austen. The Ham was outside the line of the original city wall, which at one time formed The Ham's north border. (The first section of that wall, starting at the city's south gate, ran east roughly along the present-day New Orchard Street.) The Ham is remembered in the name Ham Gardens, a small street towards the north side of the precinct off Philip Street.
After the area for the new precinct had been cleared of the 1960s/1970s buildings, and before construction of the precinct's underground car park was started, an extensive archaeological project was carried out by Museum of London Archaeology Service to expose, study, and preserve underground structures such as sections of the original city wall, the 17th century 'Bum Ditch', a well and cellars from the 18th century, and the 19th century cobbles of the original Marchant's Passage.
The new precinct opened in three phases. Phase one opened on 4 November 2009, Phase two in May 2010, and the final phase in August 2010.
The area has seven pedestrianised streets and a central plaza (SouthGate Place), and is bordered by New Orchard Street, Manvers Street, Dorchester Street, and Southgate Street. The names of the new pedestrianised streets within the precinct follow the names of the streets that previously occupied similar positions on the site (Philip Street, Newark Street, Railway Street, etc), although Marchant's Passage (named after Abraham Marchant, a firefighter who died trying to rescue a girl from a fire in Union Street in 1815) has been reborn as New Marchant's Passage. The street sign for New Marchant's Passage is missing the apostrophe. 
There are six buildings forming the new SouthGate: St. Lawrence House, Philip House, Debenhams, Block E/F (which has an arcade, Little SouthGate, running through it at ground level), Marchant House, and Southgate House. There are bridges interconnecting Block E/F with Marchant House, and Marchant House with Southgate House, creating a continuous goods-delivery first-floor corridor between these blocks for the commercial units. 
The residential units were released to market on 16 April 2011. These are on the second floor of St. Lawrence House and the second and third floors of Philip House, Marchant House, and Southgate House.
In late 2011 Multi started developments to more closely integrate Bath Spa railway station and Bath bus station with SouthGate, and redevelop some of the railway station car park and northern ramp into a restaurant complex, to be called The Vaults, at a cost of £12 million.
Fire incident.
On 23 September 2008, there was a serious fire and explosions on the construction site, caused by gas cylinders. There was a large fireball with one of the explosions, reaching higher than the surrounding cranes. Surrounding streets were closed while the fire was tackled. Trains did not stop at the station during the fire for safety. The fire was reported in national newspapers.
Shops.
The centre is anchored by Debenhams and has over 50 other shops, including Currys, Topman/Topshop, H&M, New Look, Apple Store, Build A Bear Workshop, Cult, Urban Outfitters, Fat Face, River Island, Republic, and Boots. Restaurants include Pizza Express, Caffè Nero, Krispy Kreme, a branch of Giraffe Restaurants, and Cake Café; and there is also a Sainsbury's Local supermarket. More-recent retail openings include Pretty Eccentric and Plain Lazy. Currys is the only shop that has been continuously present for over forty years: it was in Southgate Street up until the early 1970s, was then in the old Southgate Shopping Centre, and is now in the new SouthGate and is a Currys PCWorld 2-1 store. 
Block E/F was designed to accommodate restaurants on the first floor and, on the upper floor, a leisure centre, including a swimming pool under the large central glass roof. Both the first and upper floors feature outdoor balconies facing into SouthGate Place through Georgian columns spanning the two levels. The developers were unable to find a tenant to operate the planned leisure centre and the floor has been re-purposed as office space. However, the plans for the first floor were fulfilled with Jimmy's World Grill %26 Bar taking approximately half the floor (entrance on Dorchester Street) and Cosy Club taking the other half (entrance on SouthGate Place). Cosy Club's space includes the first-floor balcony facing into SouthGate Place. 
Brunel Square opened late 2012 and is set amid Brunel’s railway arches and overlooking an open piazza, The Vaults brought 5 new culinary outlets to SouthGate’s menu. First to open in The Vaults were Bertinet Bakery, GBK, Graze, Prezzo Jika Jika & Nando's.

USS Akbar (SP-599)

USS "Akbar" (SP-599) (possibly meaning "great" in Arabic) was a wooden patrol boat in the service of the United States Navy during World War I. She was purchased by the Navy for patrol duties during the conflict and was sold at war's end. Her ultimate fate is unknown.
Military career.
"Akbar" was a wooden-hulled yacht built by the Mathis Yacht Building Company of Camden, New Jersey, in 1915. The State of Maine purchased the yacht from her owner, George W. C. Drexel of Philadelphia, and then lent her the section commander at Bath, Maine. The U.S. Navy purchased the craft on 17 May 1917 and placed her in commission on 31 May 1917, with Quartermaster 1st Class Robert A. Webster in command.
After commissioning, the boat was assigned to the 1st Naval District. "Akbar" carried out harbor patrol duty in the Rockland, Maine, section until May 1918 when she was shifted to the Portland, Maine, section. The former yacht served on patrol duty in that area through the end of World War I in November 1918.
"Akbar" was decommissioned on 17 January 1919. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 2 October 1919, and she was sold on 2 January 1920 to F. Chester Everett of Maiden, Massachusetts.

Ave Maria Grotto

Ave Maria Grotto, in Cullman, Alabama, is a landscaped, park in an old quarry on the grounds of St. Bernard Abbey, providing a garden setting for 125 miniature reproductions of some of the most famous religious structures of the world. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on February 24, 1976, and to the National Register of Historic Places on January 19, 1984.
History.
The stone and concrete models are the work of Brother Joseph Zoettl, a Benedictine monk of St. Bernard's, who devoted some 50 years to the project, the last three decades (1932 to 1961) almost without interruption. They incorporate discarded building supplies, bricks, marbles, tiles, pipes, sea shells, marbles, plastic animals, costume jewelry, toilet bowl floats and cold cream jars. 
Born in 1878 in the Kingdom of Bavaria, Brother Joseph was maimed in an accident that gave him a hunchback. He immigrated to the United States as a teenager, settling in northern Alabama. Soon afterward he began studying at the newly founded Benedictine monastery of St. Bernard’s, where he took his vows in 1897. He ran the monastery’s power plant and was, even by a monk's standards, a withdrawn, quiet man. Until his death in 1961, Brother Joeseph rarely left Alabama.
The display is strung out along a forested trail that winds down past several building clusters built into a steep hillside. Roman Catholic cathedrals and monasteries predominate — notably St. Peter's Basilica, the Monte Casino Abbey and the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes — along with scenes from ancient Jerusalem, whence the grotto's sobriquet, "Jerusalem in Miniature". Half of the hillside features buildings and scenes from the Holy Land. Also displayed are number of secular buildings and the occasional pagan temple, including the Alamo Mission in San Antonio, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Spanish missions, German castles, South African shrines, Hansel and Gretel's Temple of the Fairies, and even the St. Bernard Abbey power station, where the monk worked shoveling coal. 
Near the beginning of the path stands an imagined Tower of Babel, recalling the vainglorious attempt of humans to build a tower to the heavens. Close to the end, a Tower of Thanks expresses Brother Joseph’s gratitude for the support he received throughout the years building his sculptures.
Though executed in great detail, the scale of the edifices is often distorted, with towers and buttresses too large or small, as onsite literature acknowledges. A central artificial cave constitutes the Ave Maria Grotto proper, with pretend-stalactite-encrusted ceiling and statues of the Virgin Mary and assorted monks and nuns. 
A fictionalized depiction of the Grotto serves as the backdrop for Jacob Appel's love story, "Winter Honeymoon".

Leonid Teliga

Leonid Teliga (28 May 1917 – 21 May 1970) was a Polish sailor, writer, journalist, translator and the first Pole to single-handedly circumnavigate the globe on his yawl "Opty".
Life.
Youth.
Although he was born in Russia, his parents decided to settle back in Poland after it regained independence. He was raised in Grodzisk Mazowiecki. After failing to get into medical studies, he decided to attend military academy. In 1937, he finished a yachting course in Jastarnia.
During and after World War II.
During the September Campaign Teliga fought in 44th Infantry Regiment, and was wounded at Tomaszów Mazowiecki. In 1940, he arrived in Azov, where he took a skipper course and became a fisherman. Eventually, he takes part in the evacuation of harbours on Crimea. In 1942, he joined the newlyformed Polish Army with which he got through to Great Britain. After taking a navigation course in Canada, he was fighting in No. 300 Squadron as a gunner.
He returned to Poland in 1947. He used every occasion to return to the sea, sometimes as a skipper or sailing instructor, later as a journalist. In the 50s and 60s, he published several short stories collections and novels based on his various voyages. In 1957, Teliga went to North Korea to participate in the works of UN Armistice Commission.
Circumnavigation of the Earth.
The yacht "Opty" was designed by engineer Leon Tumiłowicz, based on his earlier construction, the "Tuńczyk" class, but modified so that it would better fit the task of long, solitary cruise. "Tuńczyk"'s predecessor, the "Konik Morski" type, was actually the first Polish seagoing construction, designed back in 1936. The construction of "Opty" began in January 1966, and finished in October. Although he received some support from Polish Yachting Association and other sources, Teliga funded the construction mostly on his own. Even though masts and booms were wooden, the yacht was farily well equipped, as it had a pneumatic raft, a plastic boat for easier communication with the coast, and a wide set of sails for every kind of wind.
After having "Opty" transported to Casablanca, Teliga began his journey on 25 January 1967, heading west. During the course of the cruise, he visited Canary Islands, Lesser Antilles, Panama Canal, Galápagos Islands, Marquesas Islands, Tahiti, Bora Bora, Fiji and Dakar. In Panama Canal, he experienced an unexpected delay as it took eleven days to persuade the Canal's administration to let him pass. Most likely that was the reason for him to skip Australia and do the final section of the circumnavigation without any landings, as after failing to get Australian visa he expected similar obstructions there.
During his journey, Teliga became fairly well known, and acquired honorary membership of several yacht clubs. He experienced a hospitable welcome in nearly every port, and, incidentally, met compatriots in most of them.
By cruising non-stop from Fiji to Dakar for 165 days, he beat the world record previously held by Bernard Gilboy, who sailed single-handedly for 163 days in an attempt to cross the Pacific Ocean. However, when Teliga landed in Dakar on 9 January 1969, Robin Knox-Johnston has already been at sea for 210 days.
On 5 April 1969, he crossed his course from 1967, finishing the circumnavigation. It took him "2 years, 13 days, 21 hours and 15 minutes"
Due to rapidly developing cancer, Teliga was forced to stop in Casablanca. He was transported back to Poland by plane. Despite having an operation, he died in May 1970.

Battle of Chumonchin Chan

The Battle of Chumonchin Chan or the Action of 2 July 1950 was the only major battle fought between surface combatants during the main phase of the Korean War. It began after an Allied flotilla encountered a Korean People's Navy supply fleet.
Battle.
On 2 July 1950, the USS "Juneau", HMS "Black Swan", and HMS "Jamaica" were sailing along the coast of the Sea of Japan (East Sea) when they encountered four North Korean torpedo and gunboats that had just finished escorting a flotilla of ten ammunition ships up the coast. The North Korean torpedo boats began an attack on the allied ships. 
Before their torpedoes could be fired however, they were met with a salvo of gunfire from the United Nations ships which destroyed three of the torpedo boats. The surviving North Korean craft fled. Later in July, the "Juneau" encountered the same ammunition ships and destroyed them.

S-Nitrosothiol

"S"-Nitrosothiols, also known as thionitrites, are organic compounds or functional groups containing a nitroso group attached to the sulfur atom of a thiol. "S"-Nitrosothiols have the general formula RSNO, where "R" denotes an organic group.
"S"-Nitrosothiols have received much attention in biochemistry because they serve as donors of the nitrosonium ion NO+, and nitric oxide and some organic nitroso derivatives serve as signaling molecules in living systems, especially related to vasodilation. Red blood cells, for instance, release "S"-nitrosothiols into the bloodstream under low-oxygen conditions, causing the blood vessels to dilate.
The addition of a nitroso group to a sulfur atom of an amino acid residue of some protein is known as "S"-nitrosation or "S"-nitrosylation. This is a reversible process and a major form of posttranslational modification of proteins.
"S"-Nitrosated proteins (SNOs) serve to transmit nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity and to regulate protein function through mechanisms analogous to phosphorylation: NO donors target specific amino acids motifs; post-translational modification leads to changes in protein activity, protein interactions, or subcellular location of target proteins; all major classes of proteins can undergo "S"-nitrosylation; and enzymes play a primary role in regulation of "S"-nitrosylation. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity leads directly to SNO formation. NOSs are hemoproteins that combine reductase and oxygenase catalytic domains in one monomer to synthesize NO from the terminal nitrogen atom of L-arginine in the presence of NADPH and O2. NOSs target specific Cys residues for "S"-nitrosylation. Thiol "S"-nitrosylation and NO transfer reactions (transnitrosation reactions) are involved in virtually all classes of cell signaling, ranging from regulation of ion channels and G-protein coupled reactions to receptor stimulation and activation of nuclear regulatory protein.
Structure and reactions.
The prefix "S" indicates that the NO group is attached to sulfur. The S-N-O angle deviates strongly from 180° because the nitrogen atom bears a lone pair of electrons.
"S"-Nitrosothiols arise from condensation from nitrous acid and a thiol:
Many other methods exist for their synthesis. They can be synthesized from thiols using NaNO2/H+, N2O3, N2O4, HNO, NOCl, RONO, NO2, HNO2, bovine aortic endothelial cells, among others. NaNO2/H+ and tert-butyl nitrite (tBuONO) are commonly used.
Once formed, these deeply colored compounds are often thermally unstable with respect to formation of the disulfide and nitric oxide:
"S"-Nitrosothiols release NO+ upon treatment with acids:
and they can transfer nitroso groups to other thiols:
Detection.
"S"-Nitrosothiols can be detected with UV-vis spectroscopy.

Dale Bennett

Dale Owen Bennett (born 6 January 1990) is an English professional footballer, who currently plays for Forest Green Rovers as a defender. 
Career.
Bennett began his career at English Football League Championship side Watford in the side's academy system. He captained the U-18 side, and signed professionally in March 2008. He made his first-team debut for Watford as a 71st minute substitute in a 1–0 victory over West Ham United in the League Cup on 23 September 2008.
In November 2008 Bennett joined Conference National side Kettering Town on a month-long loan, which was later extended to the rest of the season. Bennett made his first Football League appearance for Watford in their 1–0 win against Barnsley in September 2009, following an injury to captain Jay DeMerit. Bennett's attitude in training and matches was praised by his manager Malky Mackay, and he retained his place in the team for the following game against Plymouth Argyle, where the team again won 1–0.
Bennett's next run of regular first-team football came in April 2010, when he played in all six games, initially in place of DeMerit, and later Lloyd Doyley. Mackay commented that Bennett was improving as he gained experience. His contract was subsequently extended until the end of the 2010–11 season. At the end of Watford's 2010–11 campaign, the club exercised its option and signed Bennett through the 2012–2013 season. On 27 October 2011, Bennett joined Brentford on a month's loan. He scored his first career goal on his Brentford debut, the winner in a 2–1 win over Chesterfield on 29 October. This proved to be his only appearance for the Bees as injury ruled him out of all other games during his loan spell. Once recovered from his injury, Bennett re-joined Brentford on loan on 1 January 2012 for 28 days. He made four appearances before returning to Watford. Bennett made his first start for Watford in the 2011–12 season away to West Ham United on 7 March 2012. He had to be stretchered off in the second half due to a clash of heads with John Eustace leaving him concussed and not able to continue.
On 31 August 2012, he signed a one-month loan deal with AFC Wimbledon, this was extended for another month on 5 October. AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley announced on 28 October that he would be releasing Bennett on account of injury. On 22 November 2012, Bennett joined League One side Yeovil Town on loan until January 2013. He made his Yeovil Town debut as a substitute in their 3–1 defeat against Carlisle United but this was Bennett's only appearance for the club as he returned to Watford on 8 December due to a back injury.
On 24 January 2013, Bennett joined Forest Green Rovers on a two-and-a-half-year deal, linking up with former team-mate, Eddie Oshodi. After overcoming an injury that he arrived with, he made his Forest Green debut on 9 February 2013 in a 1–1 draw at Kenilworth Road against Luton Town.

Eva Wagner-Pasquier

Eva Wagner-Pasquier (born 14 April 1945 in Oberwarmensteinach) is a German opera manager. She is the daughter of Wolfgang Wagner and Ellen Drexel. On 1 September 2008, Wagner-Pasquier and her half-sister Katharina Wagner were named as joint directors of the Bayreuth Festival which is largely dedicated to the stage works of their great-grandfather Richard Wagner.
Following the death of her uncle Wieland Wagner, Wagner-Pasquier acted as her father's assistant at Bayreuth from 1967 to 1975. She was an assistant at the Vienna State Opera, and an opera director at the Royal Opera House. Wagner-Pasquier oversaw opera and concert productions for the Munich-based classical music company Unitel Films until 1984. She was Director of Programming at the Opéra Bastille from 1987–93. She has also worked for Houston Grand Opera, the Théâtre du Châtelet, the Teatro Real, the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence, and is currently an Artistic Consultant to The Metropolitan Opera. 
The joint appointment at Bayreuth followed a long feud in which Wolfgang had favoured his second wife Gudrun and daughter Katharina as successors, the overseeing committee, the Richard Wagner Foundation of Bayreuth, had favoured Eva, and Wieland's daughter Nike had also put herself forward. The eventual compromise with both Wolfgang and the foundation supporting the sisters followed Gudrun's death in 2007. 
Eva Wagner-Pasquier is married to the French film producer Yves Pasquier. They have a son Antoine Amadeus Pasquier (b. 1982).

The Littlest Hitler is a 2006 collection of short stories by Ryan Boudinot.
Plot.
The book has characters who have occupations such as drugstore workers and pharmacists. The short stories have things such a cannabalistic mother, serial killers, zombies and terrorists. The last story is called "The Newholy" which has to do with immigration.
Reception.
A "Publishers Weekly" review says, "Reminiscent of early Rick Moody or the short stories of Daniel Handler, each of Boudinot's 13 stories is a microcosm of weirdness imbued with imagination and maniacal wit". A "Kirkus Reviews" review says "When Boudinot writes shtick, he's tiresome. When he writes fully developed stories, he's abrasive, thought-provoking and explosively funny". The book was "Publishers Weekly"'s book of the year.

Steve Larkin

Stephen Patrick Larkin (December 9, 1910 – May 2, 1969) was a Major League Baseball pitcher. 
Larkin joined the Detroit Tigers organization in 1931, signing a contract with Evansville. During the 1931 season, he played in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Wheeling, West Virginia. During the 1932 season, he played for the Tigers' farm clubs in Decatur, Illinois, Moline, Illinois, Huntington, and Beaumont. In 1933, he compiled a 22–7 record for the Shreveport Sports in the Dixie League, pitching 280 innings with 142 strikeouts and 96 walks. He led the Dixie League in wins and winning percentage during the 1933 season. 
After his strong performance in Shreveport, Larkin was invited to the Tigers' spring camp at Lakeland, Florida, in 1934. He played in two games for the 1934 Detroit Tigers. He pitched 6 innings and gave up only one earned run for an earned run average of 1.50.
With the Tigers' having a strong pitching staff, Larkin was sent to Beaumont in June 1934. In November 1934, "The Sporting News" profiled Larkin as one of the "Minors Coming UP to Majors in '35." "The Sporting News" said of Larkin: "If size, weight and general physical appointments mean anything, somebody will have to move over on the Detroit bench and make room for Steve Larkin next spring. The 200-pounder, towering an inch above six feet ... appears to be one of the most promising of the pitching prospects scheduled to receive big league inspection."
Larkin did not make the Tigers' roster in 1935. After two more years in Detroit's farm system, playing in Beaumont and Milwaukee, Larkin was released by the Tigers' organization in December 1936. Larkin concluded his baseball career in 1938 pitching for Portland and Fort Worth.

<doc id="19445663" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19445663" title="Oceanic dispersal">
Oceanic dispersal

Oceanic dispersal is a type of biological dispersal that occurs when organisms transfer from one land mass to another by way of a sea crossing. Often this occurs via large mats of floating vegetation, such as are sometimes seen floating down major rivers in the tropics and washing out to sea, occasionally with animals trapped on them. Dispersal via such a raft is sometimes referred to as a "rafting event."
History.
Rafting has played an important role in the colonization of isolated land masses, such as Madagascar, which has been isolated for ~120 million years (Ma), and South America, which was isolated for much of the Cenozoic. Both land masses, for example, appear to have received their primates by this mechanism. According to genetic evidence, the common ancestor of the lemurs of Madagascar appears to have crossed the Mozambique Channel by rafting between 50 and 60 Ma ago. Likewise, the New World monkeys are thought to have originated in Africa and rafted to South America by the Oligocene, when the continents were much closer than they are today. Madagascar also appears to have received its tenrecs (25–42 Ma ago), nesomyid rodents (20–24 Ma ago) and euplerid carnivorans (19–26 Ma ago) by this route and South America its caviomorph rodents (over 30 Ma ago). Simian primates (ancestral to monkeys) and hystricognath rodents (ancestral to caviomorphs) are believed to have similarly dispersed from Asia to Africa about 40 Ma ago.
Among reptiles, several iguanid species in the South Pacific have been hypothesized to be descended from iguanas that rafted from Central or South America (an alternative theory involves dispersal of a putative now-extinct iguana lineage from Australia or Asia). Similarly, skinks of the related genera "Mabuya" and "Trachylepis" apparently both floated across the Atlantic from Africa to South America and Fernando de Noronha, respectively, during the last 9 Ma. Skinks from the same group have also rafted from Africa to the Cape Verde islands, Madagascar, the Seychelles, the Comoros and Socotra. (Among lizards, skinks and geckoes seem especially capable of surviving long transoceanic journeys.)
Colonization of groups of islands can occur by an iterative rafting process sometimes called island hopping. Such a process appears to have played a role, for example, in the colonization of the Caribbean by mammals of South American origin (including caviomorphs and monkeys).
However, oceanic dispersal of terrestrial species may not always take the form of rafting; in some cases, swimming or simply floating may suffice. Tortoises of the genus "Chelonoidis" arrived in South America from Africa in the Oligocene; they were probably aided by their ability to float with their heads up, and to survive up to six months without food or fresh water. The dispersal of anthracotheres from Asia to Africa about 40 Ma ago, and the much more recent dispersal of hippos (descendants of anthracotheres) from Africa to Madagascar may have occurred by floating or swimming.

Clairinsh

Clairinsh or Clairinch (Scottish Gaelic: Clàr-Innis) is an island in Loch Lomond, central Scotland.
Just east of Inchcailloch, Clairinsh is flat: just 13 m at its highest point, and 0.45 km long. The word "clàr" refers to a flat surface, such as a board or table. From above, the outline of the island bears a remarkable resemblance to a fish.
History.
In 1225, the Third Earl of Lennox gave Clairinch to Absolon/Anselan of Buchanan, the son of the King of Ulster. The island became associated with that family. It was a meeting place of Clan Buchanan, and "Clàr-Innis!" was their slogan or battle cry. His yearly rent was one pound of wax.
Clairinsh was purchased in 1682 by the Third Duke of Montrose, and it remained the property of this family for the next two hundred and fifty years. In 1934 the Clan Buchanan acquired it for the Buchanan Society. In 1958 Clairinsh was declared as the first part of a National Nature Reserve under an agreement with the Buchanan Society/landowner.
There is a crannog off Clairinch, called "Keppinch" or "The Kitchen", where Roman pottery has been found.

David Archuleta (album)

David Archuleta is the self-titled debut album of "American Idol" season 7 runner-up David Archuleta. It was released on November 11, 2008, in the United States, under Jive Records. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA (denoting shipments of 500,000 copies) on January 29, 2009. The first single, "Crush", was released to radio on August 1. The album was released in the UK on May 11, 2009. The UK album release was set to coincide with his UK tour with Rock/Pop band McFly in April/May 2009.
Reception and album information.
"David Archuleta" received mixed reviews from critics. "Billboard" praised "David Archuleta", calling it "charming" and filled with performances "meant for arenas." It also credited Archuleta as having a "once-in-a-decade pop voice: A silky tenor with a natural melancholy." Ken Barnes of "USA Today" gave the album a positive review saying, "On American Idol runner-up David Archuleta’s first, self-titled album, the 17-year-old singer delivers a non-stop succession of polite pop songs swathed in gauzy cotton-candy textures and catchy choruses. And that's exactly what he should be doing." "The New York Times" writes "(Archuleta) has a lovely, foggy R&B voice out of scale with his small body". Writes the review, "The music, made by many producers and songwriters, averages out different forms of radio-format blandness, with tinges of Coldplay and Shania Twain, and a few dollops of good writing." "Los Angeles Times" wrote The record is larded with awkward modernist R&B, Christian semaphore ballads like 'You Can' and warm-milk mewling that makes David Cook, Archuleta's "Idol" foe, sound like Robert Plant.
Singles.
The first single, "Crush," was released to radio on August 1, 2008, and was commercially released on August 12, 2008. Its first week it debuted at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 with 166,000 units sold. The single has sold almost 2 million copies in the United States.
Archuleta confirmed on his official MySpace blog on November 21, 2008 that "A Little Too Not Over You", a song which he co-wrote, was the next single following "Crush". It was released to radio on January 6, 2009.
On March 13, 2009, Archuleta released a couple of songs from "David Archuleta" on iTunes that were previously not available as single downloads. "Works for Me" came as a bonus track on the Wal-mart version of "David Archuleta", and "Somebody Out There" was exclusive to those who pre-ordered the album on iTunes. Both songs were also included in a 4 track EP titled "Four for the Fans", released in 2010 exclusively on iTunes, before the release of Archuleta's single, "Something 'Bout Love", from his third studio album, "The Other Side of Down" (2010).
Chart performance.
The album debuted at the number-two spot on the "Billboard" 200 chart (issue of November 29, 2008), with sales of 183,000 copies in the United States. As of January 2011, the album has sold 764,000 copies in the United States.

George Albert Bazaine-Hayter

George Albert Bazaine-Hayter (December 4, 1843, Amiens, Somme – February 2, 1914), known as Albert, was a French general, son of Pierre-Dominique (Adolphe) Bazaine and nephew of Marshal Bazaine, on whose General Staff he served in the French intervention in Mexico and during the Franco-Prussian War. He described the French position in 1870: ""We had no preparation: no horses to haul the artillery reserves and the bridge equipment, no tools to dig the trenches; our machine guns arrived directly from the factories and those using them were not properly trained in their use; our artillery was inferior in number, in effectiveness and in reach, in summary, we were powerless against the Prussian artillery. Our battle formations, already old in 1859, were old-fashioned and stuck in a rut; our procedures and regulations had not been reviewed for over 30 years; our orders, brave beyond doubt, were ignorant, without doctrine and without initiative. These were the causes of our defeats, of all our defeats"". 
Despite his familial connection with the unfortunate marshal, he had a successful military career of his own and co-wrote a number of works on infantry tactics and the use of attacking tactics in infantry doctrine. He was also an early critic of the lack of effective French military preparation to counter the increasing threat posed to France by the German Empire. He was one of the early pioneers of military aviation and a keen supporter of the Wright brothers when they visited Camp d'Auvours, Le Mans in 1908. He adopted his mother's maiden name Hayter as part of his surname in recognition of the support the Hayters gave to his unfortunate uncle, Marshal Bazaine, in escaping from his prison on Île Sainte-Marguerite and in his later life in exile.
Quotes.
"Firepower does not weaken the offensive. Never forget that defensive battle will seldom bring victory. However powerful weapons become, the victory will go to the offensive which stimulates moral forces, disconcerts the enemy and deprives him of his freedom of action"

LFG Roland D.III

__NOTOC__
The LFG Roland D.III was a fighter aircraft produced in Germany during World War I. It was a further development of the D.I fighter, itself derived from the C.II reconnaissance aircraft. These machines had a fuselage that completely filled the interplane gap, a design feature intended to improve aerodynamics. However, it also resulted in limiting the pilot's field of vision in the down and forward direction, leading to complaints. LFG attempted to remedy this in the D.III design by introducing a gap between the upper fuselage and the upper wing, braced by cabane struts. The size of the tailplane was also increased.
While this did indeed result in an improvement over the Roland D.II that had preceded it, the performance of the D.III was inferior to that of other contemporary fighters available to the German Army, in particular those produced by Albatros, and the aircraft was therefore only produced in small quantities.
Forward visibility, though better in the D.III than the D.I was still not good and LFG tried to improve it with another variant, the D.V. The fuselage diameter was decreased and the decking forward of the cockpit lowered exposing all of the upper parts of the engine cylinders. Three were built, one with the Argus engine of the D.II and two with the Mercedes D.III, another upright 6-cylinder engine. The visibility was not much improved and the problem was only solved with the LFG Roland D.VII, which used a V-8 engine.

C. Burton Hotel

The C. Burton Hotel, also known as the Sycamore House, is located on NY 55 a mile west of Grahamsville, New York, United States. It is a wooden Greek Revival structure dating to 1851.
It is possibly the only Greek Revival building in Sullivan County with columns, and the only one with a ballroom. In its later years it was used as a house and a medical office; currently it is unoccupied. In 2005 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Building.
As it currently stands the building is a rectangular two-story six-by-two-bay structure on a stone foundation. Its front facade is centered on a recessed porch, with large fluted Doric columns, echoed by similar cornerboards. A broad gabled roof is covered in metal cladding, and round-arched louver windows are near the top at either end. The rear features a polygonal bay with two entrance doors.
The building is sided in clapboard. The roofline is marked by a deep molded cornice with returns and a wide entablature.
Three French doors give entrance from the recessed front porch to the interior, which retains its original plan. The large entrance hall has a set of stairs which lead to the ballroom upstairs, as well as a smaller area that may have been partitioned off from it to make a kitchen. Many areas, particularly in the central portion of the building, also have their original finishes and trim, including some marble mantels.
History.
The building's seamless and symmetrical appearance belies its original construction and expansion. C. Burton originally built the small southern section as a roadside tavern in 1851. Although he was not on the main turnpike route through the area at the time, business was apparently good enough that he expanded the building threefold two years later, adding the current main block.
It continued to do well under his and other ownership throughout the rest of the century, first for travelers and then as a regional vacation center, with guests coming via stagecoach from the New York, Orange & Western station in nearby Fallsburg. Starting in 1898, the Grahamsville Fair was held on the land behind the hotel, boosting annual visitation. Early in the new century, the first of two doctors began using it as a residence and office while continuing to put up guests as well, under the names Sycamore House and Hawthorne House.
Grahamsville's resort traffic began to decline with the change in vacationing patterns as the 20th century progressed, and it was just north of Fallsburg and other areas to the south and east that had been dominated by Jewish summer communities, which captured most of that market, the largest segment still regularly visiting the Catskills for extended periods in the summer. 
From 1938 until 1953 or 1954, it was owned by Dr. Karl H. Messinger, who used the ground floor as his offices, surgery and waiting room. The upper floor was the family's living quarters, including the ballroom which served as the living/dining room. The north extension was rented as a two storey apartment. Dr. Messinger extensively restored the building during his ownership, including adding a garage to the west side of the building, removing four outdated and unsafe fireplaces, while retaining the marble mantels and surrounds where possible,and replacing the essentially unusable floor in the entrance porch. The flooring he used was marble from tombstones abandoned when the Rondout Reservoir was flooded. They were laid face down in red grout, except for one at the main entrance which was engraved "Home At Last". Dr. Messinger and his family moved away from Grahamsville in 1953, the completion of the Reservoir having made the essentially cashless economy of the area unable to support a medical practice, and sometime within the next couple of years, he sold the property. 
In 1994 those owners in turn sold to another family, which has been trying to restore the house while living elsewhere.
Aesthetics.
The hotel's implementation of the Greek Revival style, and its size, is unusually sophisticated for a rural commercial building far from any major city then (or now). The massive columns and recessed porch are possibly the only such instances of those features on a Greek Revival building in Sullivan County.

Duncan Canal (Alaska)

The Duncan Canal is a naturally occurring inland waterway in the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, USA. It deeply penetrates Kupreanof Island, separating the Lindenberg Peninsula, on the southeast side of the island from the main island. It was first charted in 1793 by James Johnstone, one of George Vancouver's officers during his 1791-95 expedition. It was named after the English missionary William Duncan.
The Duncan Canal Portage is a popular hiking trail across the northern end of the Lindenberg Peninsula. It originally provided access to the northern end of the Duncan Canal directly from Frederick Sound.

Hiram High School

Hiram High School is a public high school in Hiram, Georgia, United States.
History.
The history of a school in the Hiram area goes back a century. The earliest records list teachers working between 1907 and 1913, when a new three-room schoolhouse was built in Hiram. The school burned in 1922. Two years later, in 1924, a new school was built on the present location of Hiram Elementary School. In 1927, C. T. Norton became the principal and the school enrolled 177 pupils, the largest class so far. At that point Hiram was one of just 82 high schools in Georgia accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1930 the nearby Vernon School was consolidated with Hiram and a steel-body bus was operated to bring the students from the Vernon community. The next year, in 1931, C. E. Landrum became the principal, placing a previously missing importance on sports for the school.
Over the next 24 years, the old school was regularly expanded to account for increased population in the area. In 1955, an entirely new school was built and remained in operation until 1968. From 1938 to 1968, the school's enrollment had expanded from 350 to 1000 students. In 1968, the Paulding County School District consolidated Hiram into Paulding County High School.
Hiram remained without a secondary school for 31 years. In the late 1990s, the present campus was built on a new site one mile to the west of downtown Hiram. The new Hiram High School first opened for the 1999-2000 school year. In the following years the school has seen numerous expansions and changes, such as many new sports fields, a new fine arts building, a secondary gymnasium, and a separate freshman building. In 2010, a large two-story facility that added 35 new classrooms to the school was completed on the previous site of the freshman building, allowing the large trailer classroom community (nicknamed "The Village" among students) to be removed. At present, Hiram has 1,763 enrolled students and graduates about 400 students each spring.

Symphony No. 7 (Williamson)

Australian composer Malcolm Williamson wrote his Symphony No. 7 in 1984 to a joint commission from the Chamber Youth Strings of Melbourne and the State of Victoria, Australia. It was written mostly at the composer's home in Sandon, Hertfordshire, England.
History of the Work.
Williamson was commissioned to write his Seventh Symphony by Dr Alexandra E. Cameron in 1984 on behalf of the Chamber Youth Strings of Melbourne. The piece originally had a dual purpose: to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the State of Victoria, and to give the youth orchestra a showpiece to take on a European tour in 1985. Williamson enjoyed long and fruitful relationships with youth orchestras and other organisations throughout his long career, and also wrote his Symphony No. 5 "Aquerò", the Little Mass of St. Bernadette and the ballet Heritage for young players, singers and dancers respectively. The score is dedicated to the memory of a long-time friend of Williamson's who died a year after the work's composition, Dr. Derek Goldfoot, husband of soprano Sybil Michelow (a staunch advocate of Williamson's vocal music).
The first performance of the symphony was planned for 10 January 1985 at Australia House in London, but in the event only three of the four movements were played (the scherzo was omitted). This was due to the challenging nature of the music, which meant it was not possible for the youth orchestra to rehearse all the movements sufficiently in time. The first complete performance of the symphony was given by the Chamber Youth Strings of Melbourne in the Irving Hall of the Lauriston Girls' School, Melbourne, on 12 August 1985.
Notes on the Symphony.
Since part of the commission for the Symphony No. 7 was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of The State of Victoria, Williamson decided to take Australian landscape and culture as the basis of his symphony, not unlike the Symphony No. 6 of 1982. Although each movement has a separate impetus behind it, the whole work is unified by the idea of (in the composer's words) "the unforeseen cross-pollination of ethnic groups that has enriched Australian life". This "cross-pollination" is represented by a portrait of the Kelly Gang in the first movement (illuminating the strong Irish connection), Macedonian dances in the scherzo (highlighting the thriving Macedonian community of Melbourne), and further Yugoslavian references in the finale. A celebration of the vivid landscape of Victoria is most overt in the introverted third movement, an eight-minute lament of great poise capturing the majesty of the Dandenongs and Wilsons Promontory.
Structure.
The symphony is broken up into four clearly defined movements, as follows:
Orchestration.
Williamson's Seventh Symphony requires the least resources of all his symphonies. Unlike the massive orchestral Sixth Symphony "Liturgy of Homage" (1982) or the choral-orchestral Third Symphony "The Icy Mirror" of 1973, the Seventh Symphony is scored for string orchestra only (consisting of violins, violas, celli and double basses). This gives the work its unique sense of chamber-like intimacy.

Uncial 087

Uncial 087 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 27 (Soden); is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament, dated paleographically to the 6th century. Formerly it was labelled by Θc.
Description.
The codex contains a small parts of the Gospel of Matthew 1:23-2:2; 19:3-8; 21:19-24, and the Gospel of John 18:29-35 on 3 parchment leaves (34 by 26 cm). The text is written in one column per page, 18 lines per page, in very large uncial letters. The letters are similar to Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus.
It has initial letters, diaeresis, and punctuation. The words at the end of lines sometimes are written in an abbreviated way.
The codex was brought by Porphyrius Uspensky from Sinai to Russia in 1858, and now is located at the Russian National Library (Gr. 12,278) in Saint Petersburg. Another part of the same codex is housed and at the Saint Catherine's Monasteryy (Gr. 218) in Sinai. Tischendorf described fragment housed in Petersburg:
Etiam hoc fragmentum sexti saeculi videtur; litterarum forma inprimis simile est fragmentins illis tribus evangeliorum purpureis, Romae, Londini et Vindobonae servatis, quae anno 1846 in priore collectione Monumentorum Sacrorum publicavi. In apparatu critico editionis meae VII. siglo N notata sunt.
It was also examined by Eduard de Muralt, who gave two textual variants of the codex.
From the same manuscript came one parchment leaf, it was classified as Uncial 092b. It contains Gospel of Mark 12:32-37. It has errors of itacism (e.g. εχεται for εχετε). It is still located in Saint Catherine's Monastery (Sinai Harris 11, 1 f.). It was discovered by J. Rendel Harris during his visit at Sinai in 1889, who published its text in 1890. Harris gave the following description of this fragment:
Two leaves of a sixth century MS. Of the Gospels, the first of the leaves having lost its upper half. The second leaf, having been folded in the middle when used to bind some other MS., has become illegible where it was folded. The hand is a large bold script, and the MS. From which the fragments came must have been a very fine one. The text is broken into short commata which are distinguished by a mart of punctuation: occasionally there are traces of the use of a colon as a mark of punctuation, and of as aspirate or perhaps a diacritic mark, (see the third line of Fol. 1, recto): we have printed this last as if it were an aspirate, but with some hesitation; it looks more like the pair of dots which denote initial iota connected by a scribe’s flourish. The second leaf shews the smooth breathing in its early square form: see line 15 of the recto of the leaf. The MS. shews the itacism of αι for ε as is common in early uncial texts (εχεται for εχετε).
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type with some alien readings. Aland placed it in Category II.
Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 6th century.

<doc id="19446142" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19446142" title="Substrate channeling">
Substrate channeling

Substrate channeling is the passing of the intermediary metabolic product of one enzyme directly to another enzyme or active site without its release into solution. When several consecutive enzymes of a metabolic pathway channel substrates between themselves, this is called a metabolon. Channeling can make a metabolic pathway more rapid and efficient than it would be if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, or prevent the release of unstable intermediates. It can also protect an intermediate from being consumed by competing reactions catalyzed by other enzymes.
Channeling can occur in several ways. One possibility, which occurs in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, is by a substrate being attached to a flexible arm that moves between several active sites. Another possibility is by two active sites being connected by a tunnel through the protein and the substrate moving through the tunnel; this is seen in tryptophan synthase. A third possibility is by a charged region on the surface of the enzyme acting as a pathway or "electrostatic highway" to guide a substrate that has the opposite charge from one active site to another. This is seen in the bifunctional enzyme dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase. The channeling of aminoacyl-tRNA for protein synthesis in vivo has been also reported.

Brain (food)

The brain, like most other internal organs, or offal, can serve as nourishment. Brains used for nourishment include those of pigs, squirrels, horses, cattle, monkeys, chickens and goats. In many cultures, different types of brain are considered a delicacy.
Cultural consumption.
The brain of animals features in French cuisine, in dishes such as "cervelle de veau" and "tête de veau". A dish called Magaj is popular in Gujurat, Pakistan, Bangladesh and diaspora countries. In Turkish cuisine brain can be fried, baked. It can also be consumed as salad. In Chinese cuisine, brain is a delicate item in Chongqing or Sichuan cuisine and it is often cooked in spicy hot pot or barbecued. 
Similar delicacies from around the world include Mexican "tacos de sesos". The Anyang tribe of Cameroon practiced a tradition in which a new tribal chief would consume the brain of a hunted gorilla while another senior member of the tribe would eat the heart. Indonesian cuisine specialty in Minangkabau cuisine also served beef brain in a coconut-milk gravy named gulai otak (beef brain curry). In Cuban cuisine, "brain fritters" are made by coating pieces of brain with bread crumbs and then frying them.
Some archaeological evidence suggests that the mourning rituals of European Neanderthals also involved the consumption of the brain.
Nutritional benefits of eating brain.
DHA, an important omega-3 fatty acid which is also referred to by the technical designation of 22:6, is found concentrated in mammalian brains. For example, according to the nutrition data website, 3 oz. (85 g) of cooked beef brain contains 727 mg of DHA. By way of comparison, the NIH has determined that small children need at least 150 mg of DHA per day, and pregnant and lactating women need at least 300 mg of DHA.
Fat and cholesterol.
The makeup of the brain of is about 12% fat, most of which is located in myelin (which itself is 70-80% fat). Specific fatty acid ratios will depend in part on the diet of the animal it is harvested from. The brain is also very high in cholesterol. For example, a single 140 g serving of "pork brains in milk gravy" can contain 3500 milligrams of cholesterol (1170% of the USRDA).
Risks of eating brain.
Prions.
Brain consumption can result in contracting fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and other prion diseases in humans and mad cow disease in cattle. Another prion disease called kuru has been traced to a funerary ritual among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea in which those close to the dead would eat the brain of the deceased to create a sense of immortality. 
Wild animals.
It is also well known in the hunting community that the brains of North American wild animals should not be consumed, due to the risk of chronic wasting disease. The brain is still useful to hunters, in that most animals have enough brain matter for use in the tanning of their own hides.

Classical Academy Charter School of Clifton

The Classical Academy Charter School of Clifton is a charter school located in Passaic County that serves the Clifton area. As a charter school, it is a public school serving students in grades 6-8 under a charter granted by the New Jersey Department of Education. Tuition is free and is covered by the home districts of its students.
As of the 2009-10 school year, the school had an enrollment of 109 students and 9 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 12.11:1. 40% of students come from families that are below the poverty line.
As part of its mission, the school has a policy of eliminating administrative positions and granting teachers decision-making authority. The school's compensation plan rewards teachers based on educational results, with individual and school-wide bonuses granted based on academic success. The school describes itself as the first public education program in the state in which major portions of teacher pay is based on "talent, effort, and outcomes", not longevity.
The school requires students to learn Latin for all three years as a language, in addition to English, History, Math, Science and Pre algebra or algebra 1. The school also requires three years of Literature and Literary classics, starting with Homer's "Iliad" and "Odyssey", Vergil's Aeneid and progressing to works by Dante and Shakespeare.
Awards and recognition.

This award is the highest award an American school can receive.
History.
The Board of Education trustees of the Clifton Public Schools issued a statement in October 1997 formally opposing the creation of the charter school as a drain on the resources available to the district that would shortchange special needs students.
In July 1998, Vincent De Rosa, the school's organizer, announced that the school had obtained a four-year lease on a mansion known as the Dolly Mount, and opened its doors on September 8, 1998 with an initial group of 60 students in the sixth and seventh grades.

Dismal Swamp State Park

Dismal Swamp State Park is a North Carolina state park in Camden County, North Carolina in the United States. The park was created as a state natural area in 1974 with the help of The Nature Conservancy, and on July 28, 2007 the NC General Assembly re-designated it as a state park. It opened to the public in 2008. This marked the first time that public access to Great Dismal Swamp was made possible in North Carolina. The park covers of protected land on the North Carolina/Virginia border. Park offices are three miles (5 km) south of the border on U.S. Route 17 near South Mills. Features of the park include the canal which is used regularly by boaters using the Intracoastal Waterway and several miles of hiking and biking trails.
History.
By 1650, few American Indians remained in the Great Dismal Swamp area, and European settlers showed little interest in the swamp. In 1665, William Drummond, future governor of North Carolina, was the first European to explore the lake which now bears his name. William Byrd II led a surveying party into the swamp to draw a dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina in 1728. George Washington visited the swamp and called it a "glorious paradise". He then formed the Dismal Swamp Land Company in 1763, which proceeded to drain and harvest timber from part of the area. A five-mile (8 km) ditch on the west side of the current refuge still bears his name. In 1805, the Dismal Swamp Canal began serving as a commercial highway for timber coming out of the swamp.
Before and during the American Civil War, the Great Dismal Swamp was a hideout for runaway slaves from the surrounding area. Recent research showed that thousands of Great Dismal Swamp maroons lived in the swamp between the 1600s and 1865. Harriet Beecher Stowe's "" is based on them.
While all efforts to drain the swamp failed, logging of the swamp proved to be a successful commercial activity. Logging operations continued as late as 1976. The entire swamp has been logged at least once, and many areas have been burned by periodic wildfires. Agricultural, commercial, and residential development destroyed much of the swamp, so that the remaining portion within and around the refuge represents less than half of the original size of the swamp.
Before the refuge was established, over of roads were constructed to provide access to the timber. These roads disrupted the swamp's natural hydrology, as the ditches which were dug to provide soil for the road beds drained water from the swamp. The roads also blocked the flow of water across the swamp's surface, flooding some areas of the swamp with stagnant water. The logging operations removed natural stands of bald cypress and Atlantic white cypress that were replaced by other forest types, particularly red maple. A drier swamp and the suppression of wildfires, which once cleared the land for seed germination, created ecological conditions that were less favorable to the survival of cypress stands. As a result, plant and animal variety decreased.
Dismal Swamp State Park opened in 2008. It is accessed via a floating bridge over the Dismal Swamp Canal. This is the only public access to the park's visitor's center, other than boat launches along the canal. Hiking and biking trails have opened and additional trails are under construction.
Ecology.
Dismal Swamp State Park is much drier than it was in the past. The efforts of man in the last 200 years to drain the swamp have left it drastically altered. Ditches and logging trails have cut off the normal flow of the swamp and created a series of stagnant pools and patches of dry land where continuously water covered swamps once stood. The trees of the area have changed from various types of cypress and other water loving plants to red maple and white cedar.
The white cedar thrives in the peat that is common in the area. These trees provide a habitat for several rare species. Hessel's Hairstreak a species of butterfly that is dependent on the white cedar has been spotted at the park. Black-throated Green Warblers make their nests in the white cedars.
The drained swamp lands have converted to hardwood forests of red maple, Black Walnut, Pawpaw and several species of oak. White-tailed Deer, Wild Turkey, Bobwhite and marsh rabbits live in the areas along the trails. Blackberry and blueberry patches line the trails. These berries attract a large number of American Black Bears to the area. Other common animals include the Raccoon, Opossum and Gray Fox as well as the occasional Bobcat.
Butterflies are plentiful at Dismal Swamp State Park. Forty-three species have been found in the park, including large numbers of Palamedes, zebra swallowtails, tiger swallowtails and Atlantic holy azures. Several varieties of warbler and vireo are common. Woodpeckers and hawks nest here as do Barred Owls.
Recreation.
Dismal Swamp State Park is open for year-round recreation. Dismal Swamp Canal is open to canoes and kayaks. A boat ramp at the park provides access to the canal. There are of logging trails open to hiking and mountain biking through swamp forests. Park rangers host environmental education and interpretive events. The visitor center is accessed from a floating bridge across the canal.

<doc id="19446279" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19446279" title="HMS Viper (1865)">
HMS Viper (1865)

HMS "Viper" was an armoured iron gunboat, the only ship of her class, and the fourteenth ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name. 
Design.
Designed by the Admiralty, "Viper" was a half-sister to and , and all three were built mostly as experimental vessels. While "Viper" and "Vixen" were twin screw vessels, "Waterwitch" had a water-pump propulsion system. "Vixen" was almost identical to "Viper", but was of composite construction.
Hull.
"Viper" was an armoured gunboat of the breastwork type. Her hull was of iron construction, with of teak backing. Vertical trunks were provided at the stern to lift the screws clear of the hull, thereby allowing a better hull-form for purely wind-driven sailing. 
Propulsion.
She was equipped with two sets of 4-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engines, each set powering one of her two-bladed, 9 ft diameter Maudslay & Griffiths screws. In total she developed an indicated 696 horsepower, sufficient for a top speed of . Steam was provided by two Maudslay iron fire-tube boilers with six furnaces. 
Sail plan.
She was equipped with a barquentine rig, but in 1873 all masts, rigging and upper deck obstructions were removed after the decision for "Vixen" and "Viper" to remain permanently in Bermuda. 
Armament.
"Viper" was armed with two 7-inch (6½-ton) muzzle-loading rifled guns and two 20-pounder breech-loading rifled guns. One of "Vixen" or "Viper's" 7-inch guns was displayed on the waterfront at St Georges as recently as 1991.
Construction.
"Viper" was ordered from J & W Dudgeon of Cubitt Town on 22 March 1864 and laid down the same year. She was launched on 21 December 1865 and commissioned in 1867 for comparative trials. Her total cost was £51,127.
Career.
"Vixen", "Viper" and "Waterwitch" conducted comparative trials at Stokes Bay in the Solent during the late 1860s. Although turning ability was impressive, none of the ships attained more than in an era when could achieve . Furthermore, "Vixen" was nearly lost in the Irish Channel during a winter gale in 1876, making them unsuitable for the open sea under steam or sail. "Vixen" and "Viper" were towed to Bermuda in 1868 where the geography favoured the use of steam-powered rams. 
In July 1869 both ships were employed to bring the floating dock "Bermuda" from The Narrows to the dockyard. 1873 saw the loss of all rigging, masts and upperdeck equipment, and this must have helped her to survive the 1878 hurricane which caused serious damage to the floating dock and other dockyard facilities.
Fate.
"Viper" was reduced to harbour service in 1890, was converted to a tank vessel in 1901 and was sold in 1908.

Clachan, Kintyre

Clachan is a small village in North Kintyre, Argyll & Bute. Clachan is the site of an old church, which was the principal church for the North Kintyre area. The church is surrounded by carved stone statues of the Chiefs of the Clan Alasdair. Another group of standing stones (the tallest of which is 3.4 metres), and a burial cist, are found to the south of Clachan, near Ballochroy Farm.
The last major battle to be fought in Kintyre took place on the steep slopes of Loup Hill in May 1689, when the local forces of MacDonald of Largie, McAlester of Loup and McNeill of Gallichoille, all strong supporters of King James VII, were defeated by a Government force.
Clachan is also the site of Balinakill House. Once the home of Coll McAlester, who led the first large settlement of highlanders in North Carolina at Cross Creek in the Cape Fear River valley in 1739, and later the home of Sir William Mackinnon, the house is now a self-catering residence.

Ibersheim

Ibersheim, (pronunciation (, dialect pronunciation ) is the district of Worms (Rhineland-Palatinate) that is furthest from the city centre and the smallest in terms of population.
The small locality has a 1500-year old rich history, an exemplary agriculture and is situated in a protected area of the Old Rhine.
Geography.
Geographical location.
Ibersheim is part of the Wonnegau region and borders on the local subdistricts of Worms-Rheindürkheim, Osthofen, Eich (Rhinehessen) and Hamm am Rhein.
In the east, the Rhine forms a 5 km natural subdistrict and federal state border (river kilometres 453,5 to 458,4). The area is part of a former Thine flood plain in the Upper Rhine Lowlands. With a total area of 972,1 ha, Ibersheim is the fifth-largest of 13 districts of Worms; it occupies 8,9% of the total urban area. The lowest point of Worms is at 86,5 m on "Ibersheimer Wörth", the highest point is at 89,5 m by the graveyard.
The Ibersheim subdistrict has been part of the protected landscape "Rheinhessisches Rheingebiet" since 1977. Rhine floods and low flow has to be expected. The woods "Ibersheimer Wäldchen", on the land parcel "Mittellache", also called "Mittlach", located in a former alluvial forest, have been considered a natural monument since 1966. Other areas worthy of protection with standing water vegetation and birds are on the "Ibersheimer Wörth".
Water and soil.
The Rheinaue wetlands and the Old Rhine branches characterise the subdistrict.
Dyke breaches have formed "Altes Loch" (Old Hole, 15 m deep) in 1798 and "Neues Loch" (New Hole) in 1824 through wash-outs.
The arable land is of various quality. The ground water is good and plentiful (water protection area III B); water levels do, however, vary. The city of Mainz has its water from its own waterworks from the area around Eich. Ibersheim's and Hammer's drinking water has come from the Eich waterworks at Ibersheimer Straße since 1960. On 1 July 2005, a new supply line was opened between the waterworks Osthofen and Eich and thus Ibersheim is supplied with low handness. Water supply and treatment in Eich was discontinued due to borderline water handness. Sewage has been going to the sewage treatment plant in Worms since 1984.
Climate.
The locality, like much of Rhinehessen, is one of the driest areas in Germany. Annual precipitation is usually below 500 mm. Agriculture relies on artificial irrigation from more.
Religion.
Many Christian denominations have had an influence on the village's cultural life over the centuries:
The Jews mentioned in 1834 were travelling masons who built a number of farm buildings.
From 1933 to 1939, the population rose from 277 to 519 because of the "Arbeitsmänner" (working men) in the "Reichsarbeitsdienst" (labour service) camp (RAD camp).
Religious buildings.
The following religious building are known throughout the town's long history:
Culture and places of interest.
Buildings.
The following buildings are registered for historic preservation: 
The designated historic district includes the entire original fortified town center and adjacent streets:
Events.
The local fair (Kirchweih) is held on Mary's Ascension Day (15 August) or on the weekend following it. The religious holiday (statutory in Catholic federal states and regions), also called "Iwerschemer Kerb", is mostly secular in character. Since the town's incorporation, the "Nachkerb" is no longer celebrated because that weekend marks the beginning of the "Backfischfest" (fried fish festival) in Worms, which is known throughout the region and beyond. The Kerb fair marks the end of the grain harvest and midsummer.
Until World War II, the day after Boxing Day (27 December) was Gesindetermin (servants' day). in farming, this was the day when the servants were exchanged and when the craftsmen presented the farm owners with their annual bill.

John Juyn

Sir John Juyn SL (died 24 March 1440) was a British judge. He was the son of John Juhyne, a wool merchant from Bristol, and his wife Margery. After the death of his father in 1390, Juyn inherited his estates in Bristol, Bedminster and Knowle, and his contacts with the Bristolian merchant community helped with his career; between 1422 and 1438 he served as Recorder of Bristol, and also acted as a feoffee for many of the city's leading merchants. His first appearance in records was in 1407, as a mainpernor for some Bristolian merchants sued for debt by London. He was appointed serjeant-at-law in 1415, but avoided taking this position and its financial burden until 1418. Between 1416 and 1422 he served as legal counsel for the Duchy of Lancaster, settling the matter of the Bohun estate, dividing it between Henry V and Lady Anne Hastings, and also served as counsel to Thomas, Duke of Clarence between 1418 and 1420. 
He travelled the Western circuit as an Assize justice between 1422 and 1424 before switching to the Home Counties circuit following his double-appointment as both Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Justice of the Court of Common Pleas on 5 May 1423. In May 1426 he was knighted in Parliament, and acted as a trier of petitions there from 1425 to 1439. During the same period he was frequently summoned to advise the King's council, most notably for 15 days at the November 1426 Reading council where he helped draw up laws to keep the peace between Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester and Henry Beaufort. For most of his life he lived in Somerset, and as such served on every Peace Commission between 1419 and his death, also raising loans for Henry IV in the 1420s and 1430s. He married twice, first to Edith, who died childless, and second to Alice, daughter of Bythemore, in 1436. On 9 February of the same year he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, still retaining his position in the Exchequer, and on 20 January 1439 he was made Chief Justice of the King's Bench, finally leaving his joint positions in the Courts of Exchequer and Common Pleas. He held this position for only a year before becoming ill, dying on 24 March 1440.

Italy, back at the finals tournament after missing 2009, lost all its matches and was returned to the relegation round.
Group C action ended with three teams having a record of two wins and one defeat. Norway's upset defeat of Czech Republic caused a controversy when Jaromír Jágr, a famous member of the Czech team, spoke out against other Czech stars turning down the tournament. This later triggered an international hockey dispute, when a column was posted on IIHF.com regarding these comments and about players' turning down invitations to attend. This article was later taken down and René Fasel, president of the IIHF, noted his concern. Sweden, the Czech Republic and Norway all moved on to the qualification round, while France was sent to the relegation after failing to win any matches.
In Group D the 2010 IIHF World Championship Opening Game saw the first major upset. Germany in front of a record crowd of over 77,000 persons defeated the United States in overtime, 2–1. This group proved to be full of upsets; in the next match Denmark beat the fourth-seeded Finns, followed by the Danes defeating the Americans. Finland came up with two wins to top the group and move on to the qualification round, along with Germany in second place and Denmark in third. The final match between the U.S. and Finland determined the United States' last-place finish, and they were sent to the relegation round for the first time since 2003.
Qualification round.
Group E action first saw Denmark handing favored Slovakia a blowout upset, 6–0. In the next match Finland defeated Belarus, 2–0, after outshooting them 32 to 18. Russia narrowly defeated Germany 3–2, in which Alexander Ovechkin scored the winner. Russia continued with two more wins over Denmark and Finland to propel them to the group win, making them the only team to go undefeated into the playoff round. Belarus defeated Germany in overtime, and then defeated Denmark 2–1, but this was not enough to qualify and they ended in fifth place. In yet another upset, the host Germans defeated Slovakia 2–1 to win a qualifying spot in third place, much to the delight of the German fans and coach Uwe Krupp. Finland finished in second-place after Russia, followed by Germany and Denmark. Denmark managed to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time in the history of the tournament. Slovakia finished a disappointing last, marking the third straight year in which they did not qualify for the quarter-finals in the lead up to their hosting of the 2011 IIHF World Championship. 
Group F opened with Canada flexing its offense against Norway in a 12–1 blowout. Sweden then defeated Latvia 4–2, followed by Switzerland continuing its winning streak with an upset 3–2 win against the Czechs. Latvia defeated Norway but later lost to the Czech Republic, which resulted in their last placement in the group and their failure to qualify. Sweden beat Canada after an impressive performance by Swedish goaltender Jonas Gustavsson. In another upset, Norway managed to beat the in-form Swiss 3–2, but they would end in fifth place. The Czech Republic won against Canada 3–2 to lead them to finish ahead of the Canadians in the group. Sweden capped off the round with a convincing 5–0 win over Switzerland to finish as group winners. Switzerland finished in second after Sweden, followed by the Czech Republic. Canada, somewhat surprisingly as the second seed, grabbed the last qualifying spot in fourth place.
Relegation round.
In the relegation round (Group G) the teams from the U.S., France, the newly promoted Italy and Kazakhstan faced each other after they had ended their respective preliminary groups in fourth and last place. The U.S. beat Kazakhstan in the first game in a 10–0 blowout, while France won against Italy in the decisive match for second place. There were no surprises on the second game-day, with the U.S. defeating France and Italy winning against Kazakhstan. The U.S. then defeated Italy in a shootout and France beat Kazakhstan 5–3. The final relegation results saw Kazakhstan and Italy go directly back down to Division I. Group-winners U.S. and second-placed France both qualified for the 2011 World Championships.
Playoff round.
The playoff round saw the top eight teams competing for the title of 2010 world champions. The quarter-finals began with a close match between Finland and the Czech Republic. After Petri Kontiola's early goal in the first minute, the game remained scoreless all the way into the third period. Jakub Klepiš scored the equalizer shortly after the final period started. No further goals were scored, so the game went into a scoreless overtime followed by a shootout. Jan Marek scored the decisive goal to put the Czechs into the semifinals.
In the second quarter-final, Sweden faced Denmark. This was Denmark's first appearance in the playoff round. After Sweden established a comfortable 3–0 lead, the Danes scored a goal in the second period. Seven minutes before the end Linus Omark scored a goal which restored the three-goal lead for Sweden. A late power play goal by Dane Morten Madsen was to no avail and Sweden won 4–2.
The third quarter-final featured a storied and contentious rivalry. Russia played against Canada in a repeat of the quarter-finals at the 2010 Olympics, in which Canada embarrassed the Russians 7–3. The opening period was a dead heat until a late goal by Maxim Afinogenov. Russia, still undefeated at the tournament, immediately overtook Canada in the second period, and led at one point in the third period by 4–0. Ilya Kovalchuk had a three-assist game and was a big boost for the Russians who won 5–2, following two late Canadian goals.
The final quarter-final was an evening game between the host Germany and their traditional rival, Switzerland. The first period was scoreless but not without chances, as the Swiss hit the post twice. Midway through the second period Philip Gogulla scored on the power play to give Germany the lead, and this goal would turn out to be the game winner. The Swiss outshot the Germans 41 to 27, and Dennis Endras is credited with keeping Germany in the game by preserving the one goal lead. The win put Germany in the semifinals for the first time since 1953 and the match was dubbed by the IIHF as "The Miracle at Mannheim". At the end of the match there was a brawl between the teams, which included German assistant coach Ernst Höfner getting into an altercation with Swiss defenceman Timo Helbling. Both were handed match suspensions.
After one day off the semifinals started with Sweden versus the Czech Republic. The first period was equal with both teams scoring one goal. Andreas Engqvist scored midway through the second period to put Sweden up 2–1. This lead held into very late in the third period. With 1:13 left in the third period the Czechs pulled their goalie to get a six on five opportunity and Karel Rachůnek scored the 2–2 equalizer with just 7.5 seconds left, putting the game into overtime. The overtime period stayed scoreless and it came down to the shootout. In a repeat of the quarter-final the Czechs won by a goal from Jan Marek. 
The other semifinal between Germany and Russia was a close match, much like their qualification round game. The Germans started off the scoring with a goal from Marcel Goc during a two-man power play. At the midway point of the match Evgeni Malkin scored to tie up the game for the Russians. The remainder of the game was very close, and the tie was only broken with 1:50 minutes left, when Pavel Datsyuk scored the game-winning goal. The Germans pressed in the final minutes but the score held for a 2–1 Russian victory, putting them in the final for the third straight year.
The bronze medal game was between Sweden and the surprise semifinalists, hosts Germany. Magnus Pääjärvi-Svensson scored an early goal to put up Sweden 1–0. The game then went scoreless until late in the second period when on a 4–3 rush Alexander Barta managed to retrieve his own rebound and put it top-shelf past Jonas Gustavsson, tying up the game for Germany. Early in the third period Jonas Andersson fired a shot from a very tight angle which managed to beat Dennis Endras on the five hole. The score held until Andersson netted an empty-net goal to ensure Sweden's 3–1 victory, giving them their second straight bronze medal at the worlds.
Final.
The final was played between Russia and the Czech Republic for the first time in the history of the tournament, although the predecessors of both these nations, the USSR and Czechoslovakia, had met several times in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. It was Russia's third consecutive finals appearance, and the Czech Republic's first appearance since 2006.
The match began with a goal after just 20 seconds, scored by Jakub Klepiš from a pass by Jaromír Jágr. The goal was seemingly the result of a defensive mistake which led to a Czech offensive possession with Russian defensemen out of position. For the remainder of the period the Russians held almost complete possession of the puck, and veteran Sergei Fedorov hit the post after an odd man rush. Very late in the period the Russians put the puck in the net on a power play, but it was determined to be after the clock had run out and was ruled as no goal. There was some brief confusion however, as the buzzer sounds after the clock on the scoreboard runs out. 
In the second period Russia pressed once again but the Czech Republic slowed the game down and forced Russia to regroup, resulting in an error in the Russian defensive zone when Alexander Ovechkin collided with team-mate Fedorov. This led to a 3-on-2 rush for the Czechs and Karel Rachůnek centered the puck while Tomáš Rolinek crashed the net. The puck was redirected off Rolinek's skates, and it was ruled a good goal because there was no kicking motion visible.
The third period began with more Russian pressure, including a close chance off the post by Evgeni Malkin, but at the midway point of the period Russian Alexei Emelin was given a five minute major and thrown out of the game for clipping Jaromír Jágr, who did not return for the remainder of the game. This was followed by more penalty trouble for both teams. In the final minutes after pulling goaltender Semyon Varlamov, Pavel Datsyuk buried a goal on a 5-on-3 with 35 seconds left, bringing Russia within one goal of the Czechs. Under pressure the Czech goalie Tomáš Vokoun managed to stave off the final Russian assault and the Czechs held on to win the game 2–1.
The president of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus handed out the gold medals alongside IIHF president René Fasel.
Rosters.
Each teams roster for the 2010 IIHF World Championship consists of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and 2 goaltenders, and at most 20 skaters and 3 goaltenders. All sixteen participating nations, through the confirmation of their respective national associations, had to submit a roster by the first IIHF directorate meeting on 6 May 2010.
Host selection.
Four nations, all located in Europe placed formal bids to host the 2010 IIHF World Championship. Those nations were:
Slovakia and Sweden withdrew from bidding before voting began in order to apply for the 2011 World Championship. All four nations to bid on the 2010 World Championship later received winning bids. Slovakia won the bid to host the 2011 IIHF World Championship, Sweden won its bid to host in 2012, but this decision was later switched to be the joint host of the 2012, and 2013 IIHF World Championship editions (both with Finland), and Belarus to host the 2014 IIHF World Championship.
After one round of voting, the winning bid was announced by IIHF president René Fasel on 15 May 2005, from Zürich, Switzerland. Belarus' bidding cities Minsk and Zhodzina received 18 votes to Germany's 89, thus finalizing Germany's successful bid. 
Promotions.
Official song.
The official song of the tournament is Stuck on Replay by the German electronic dance band Scooter. It is the fourth single from the album "Under the Radar Over the Top". It was released on 12 March 2010, on the day of the Hamburg concert, the biggest show of their "Under The Radar Over The Top" tour.
Mascot.
Urmel on Ice () is the official mascot of the tournament. A character created by Max Kruse and known by the German public from the Augsburger Puppenkiste and the Impy's Island (Urmel aus dem Eis ()) film was previously the mascot of the Deutsche Eishockey-Bund and the German national team. He wears number 10 on his jersey.
Motto.
The official motto of the tournament was unveiled on 2 September 2009, in Lanxess Arena and is "Germany on Ice" ().
Ambassadors.
The "World Championship Ambassadors" for 2010 included; Canadian legend Wayne Gretzky, Soviet ice hockey goaltender and ten time World champion Vladislav Tretiak, and "Germany's ice hockey player of the century" Erich Kühnhackl. They are all members of the IIHF Hall of Fame, and have all played in the IIHF World Championship previously. They were special members, alongside; Zdeno Chára, Peter Forsberg, Sergei Kostitsyn, Jari Kurri, Kim Martin, Mark Streit, Hayley Wickenheiser and Henrik Zetterberg, of a campaign called "The Green Puck campaign", which was an anti-doping initiative in association with the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Venues.
Attendance world record.
The opening game of the 74th IIHF World Championship took place at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen on 7 May between Germany and the United States. On this occasion, the stadium's planned configuration would allow for a capacity of 76,152. This figure is higher than the past ice hockey attendance World Record held by Michigan State University, which was 74,554. 
It was announced at the second intermission by "Guinness World Records" spokesman Christian Teufe, that not only had the Gelsenkirchen game passed the world record, but had exceeded it by over 3,000 individuals. The official attendance according to the IIHF, and confirmed by the Guinness World records, was 77,803. Both Eric Nystrom and David Moss, who were playing for the United States, had also played in the Michigan State game in 2001, making them the only people to have played both world record games.
The noise inside the stadium was considerably loud, due to the German ice hockey chants, whistles and drums, which according to Ryan Carter of Team USA left the Americans frustrated at the inability to communicate. Carter also said that the "crowd was definitely the seventh man in this game for Germany". Also notable about the game was that it was the first time in over 17 years of international hockey competition that Germany had defeated the United States, with Felix Schütz scoring the game winner in overtime, on Scott Clemmensen, for a 2–1 final score. The previous win was on 25 April 1993, also in Germany in Dortmund, during the 1993 World Championship when Germany beat the United States 6–3.
The President of Germany, Horst Köhler, along with other politicians were present for the match.
The overall attendance record was broken in December 2010 by The Big Chill at the Big House, though the crowd still remains the largest ever for an indoor hockey game.

Joe Kirk

Joe Kirk (New York, New York, October 1, 1903 - Los Angeles, California, April 16, 1975) was an American radio, film, and television actor who was best known for playing the role of Mr. Bacciagalupe on "The Abbott and Costello Show".
Early life and career.
Born Ignazio Curcuruto (simply known by his pet name Nat Curcuruto to his family), Kirk was born in New York City as one of four children - Letitia, Philip (1902 - 1995), Nat (1903 - 1975), and Josephine - to the Sicilian American immigrants Giuseppe "Joe" Curcuruto and Elvira Puglisi Curcuruto (1882–1977).
He got his professional start in vaudeville, where he worked as an master of ceremonies and a comedian during the 1930s.
Radio career.
Kirk was a regular voice actor on Abbott and Costello's radio show during the World War II and post-war era of the 1940s. In addition to his ongoing - and best-known role - as Mr. Bacciagalupe, the highly excitable Italian neighbor, Kirk played many other bit parts on the show as well.
As Mr. Bacciagalupe, Kirk spoke with a thick Sicilian-American accent; his surname as well was pronounced in the Sicilian manner () and not in proper Italian (). When excited, Mr. Bacciagalupe frequently made improvised asides in Sicilian dialect, which were obviously appreciated by many in the audience. Lou Costello, who was Italian American himself, also understood these side-remarks, and sometimes could not stay in character, but laughed along as well.
Television career.
In 1951, Kirk brought the popular role of Mr. Bacciagalupe to the television version of "The Abbott and Costello Show". Kirk’s friendly, mustachioed character held a variety of jobs. At various points in the show, he was a barber, grocer, fruit vendor, ice cream vendor, peanut vendor, bakery owner, and music store salesman.
In the episodes featuring his character, Mr. Bacciagalupe would often show impatience with the indecision portrayed by Lou Costello, whom he called by his Sicilian name, Luigi. As he "lost his temperature", Mr. Bacciagalupe would lapse into broken Sicilian phrases and increasingly animated gesticulation to express his frustration. Sometimes he would find his place of business wrecked by Abbott and Costello’s slapstick antics; at other times he would confound them completely and they would retreat in confusion as he crowed in triumph.
Kirk's Mr. Bacciagalupe appeared in 15 of the 26 episodes in the show's first season, 1951-1952. In all, he appeared in 19 episodes of the show's 52 total episodes through its end in 1954.
Film career.
The bulk of Joe Kirk’s early film career consisted of playing bit parts, often uncredited, in low budget productions. Typical roles for him were "ethnic" Sicilian-Americans - gangsters, bartenders, bookies, and henchmen. He appeared in several films produced at Monogram Pictures, including "Spooks Run Wild" (1941), "Dick Tracy vs. Crime Inc." (1941), "Mr. Wise Guy" (1942), and "Smart Alecks" (1942). Kirk appeared as the villager Schwartz in Universal's "House Of Frankenstein" (1944). He was occasionally billed as Joseph I. Kirk, the "I" standing for his birth-name, Ignazio.
Through his marriage to Marie Cristillo, the sister of Lou Costello, Kirk secured steady appearances (albeit in small roles) in Abbott and Costello films. His more prominent parts included the pet shop owner in "Rio Rita" (1942), Honest Dan the Bookie in "Here Come the Co-Eds" (1946), the shady real estate agent in "Buck Privates Come Home" (1947),uncredited by-stander in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948) and Dr. Orvilla in "Abbott and Costello Go to Mars" (1953).
Kirk continued acting through the late 1950s, with appearances in "The Jackie Robinson Story" (1950), the 1956 Bowery Boys comedy "Hot Shots" and Fritz Lang’s drama "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" (1956). He also took small roles in television shows such as "Adventures of Superman", "Sheriff of Cochise" and "U.S. Marshal", before retiring from show business in 1958.
Personal life.
Kirk was married to Marie Katherine Cristillo (1912–1988), who was the sister of Lou Costello and daughter of the producer Sebastian Cristillo. After their marriage Marie was known interchangeably as both Marie Curcuruto and Marie Kirk. The couple had two sons.
He was the great-uncle of the actress Marki Costello, who is the granddaughter of Lou Costello.

Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph

The Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph was an early electrical telegraph system dating from the 1830s invented by English inventor William Fothergill Cooke and English scientist Charles Wheatstone. It was the first telegraph system to be put into commercial service. The receiver consisted of a number of needles which could be moved by electromagnetic coils to point to letters on a board. This feature was liked by early users who were unwilling to learn codes, and employers who did not want to invest in staff training.
In later systems the letter board was dispensed with, and the code was read directly from the movement of the needles. This came about because the number of needles was reduced, leading to more complex codes. The change was motivated by the economic need to reduce the number of telegraph wires used, which was related to the number of needles. The change became more urgent as the insulation of some of the early installations deteriorated, causing some of the original wires to be unusable. Cooke and Wheatstone's most successful system was eventually a one-needle system that continued in service into the 1930s.
Cooke and Wheatstone's telegraph played a part in the apprehension of the murderer John Tawell. Once it was known that Tawell had boarded a train to London, the telegraph was used to signal ahead to the terminus at Paddington and have him arrested there. The novelty of this use of the telegraph in crime-fighting generated a great deal of publicity and led to increased acceptance and use of the telegraph by the public.
Inventors.
The telegraph arose from a collaboration between William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone, best known to schoolchildren from the eponymous Wheatstone bridge. This was not a happy collaboration due to the differing objectives of the two men. Cooke was an inventor and entrepreneur who wished to patent and commercially exploit his inventions. Wheatstone, on the other hand, was an academic with no interest in commercial ventures. He intended to publish his results and allow others to freely make use of them. This difference in outlook eventually led to a bitter dispute between the two men over claims to priority for the invention. Their differences were taken to arbitration with Marc Isambard Brunel acting for Cooke and John Frederic Daniell acting for Wheatstone. Cooke eventually bought out Wheatstone's interest in exchange for royalties.
Cooke had some ideas for building a telegraph prior to his partnership with Wheatstone and had consulted scientist Michael Faraday for expert advice. However, much of the scientific knowledge for the model actually put into practice came from Wheatstone. Cooke's earlier ideas for a mechanical telegraph (involving a clockwork mechanism with an electromagnetic detent) were largely abandoned.
History.
In January 1837 Cooke proposed a design for a 60-code telegraph to the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. This was too complicated for their purposes; the immediate need was for a simple signal communication between the Liverpool station and a rope-haulage engine house at the top of a steep incline through a long tunnel outside the station. Rope-haulage into main stations was common at this time to avoid noise and pollution, and in this case the gradient was too steep for the locomotive to ascend unaided. All that was required were a few simple signals such as an indication to the engine house to start hauling. Cooke was requested to build a simpler version with fewer codes, which he did by the end of April 1837. However, the railway decided to use instead a pneumatic telegraph equipped with whistles. Soon after this Cooke went into partnership with Wheatstone.
In May 1837 Cooke and Wheatstone patented a telegraph system which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. The patent recommended a five-needle system, but any number of needles could be used depending on the number of characters it was required to code. A four-needle system was installed between Euston and Camden Town in London on a rail line being constructed by Robert Stephenson between London and Birmingham. It was successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837. This was a similar application to the Liverpool project. The carriages were detached at Camden Town and travelled under a gravity into Euston. A system was needed to signal to an engine house at Camden Town to start hauling the carriages back up the incline to the waiting locomotive. As at Liverpool, the electric telegraph was in the end rejected in favour of a pneumatic system with whistles.
Cooke and Wheatstone had their first commercial success with a telegraph installed on the Great Western Railway over the from Paddington station to West Drayton in 1838. Indeed, this was the first commercial telegraph in the world. This was a five-needle, six-wire system. The cables were originally installed underground in a steel conduit. However, the cables soon began to fail as a result of deteriorating insulation and were replaced with uninsulated wires on poles.Beauchamp, page 35</ref> As an interim measure, a two-needle system was used with three of the remaining working underground wires, which despite using only two needles had a greater number of codes. But when the line was extended to Slough in 1843, a one-needle, two-wire system was installed.
From this point the use of the electric telegraph started to grow on the new railways being built from London. The Blackwall Tunnel Railway (another rope-hauled application) was equipped with the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph when it opened in 1840, and many others followed. The one-needle telegraph proved highly successful on British railways, and 15,000 sets were still in use at the end of the nineteenth century. Some remained in service in the 1930s. In September 1845 the financier John Lewis Ricardo and Cooke formed the Electric Telegraph Company. This company bought out the Cooke and Wheatstone patents and solidly established the telegraph business. In 1869 the company was nationalised and became part of the General Post Office.
Tawell Arrest.
Murder suspect John Tawell was apprehended following the use of a needle telegraph message from Slough to Paddington on 1 January 1845. This is thought to be the first use of the telegraph to catch a murderer. The message was:
A MURDER HAS GUST BEEN COMMITTED AT SALT HILL AND THE SUSPECTED MURDERER WAS SEEN TO TAKE A FIRST CLASS TICKET TO LONDON BY THE TRAIN WHICH LEFT SLOUGH AT 742 PM HE IS IN THE GARB OF A KWAKER 
WITH A GREAT COAT ON WHICH REACHES NEARLY DOWN TO HIS FEET HE IS IN THE LAST COMPARTMENT OF THE SECOND CLASS COMPARTMENT
The Cooke and Wheatstone system did not support punctuation, lower case, or some letters. Even the two-needle system omitted the letters J, Q, and Z; hence the misspellings of 'just' and 'Quaker'. This caused some difficulty for the receiving operator at Paddington who repeatedly requested a resend after receiving K-W-A which he assumed was a mistake. This continued until a small boy suggested the sending operator be allowed to complete the word, after which it was understood. After arriving, Tawell was followed to a nearby coffee shop by a detective and arrested there. Newspaper coverage of this incident gave a great deal of publicity to the electric telegraph and brought it firmly into public view.
The widely publicised arrest of Tawell was one of two events which brought the telegraph to greater public attention and led to its widespread use beyond railway signalling. The other event was the announcement by telegraph of the birth of Alfred Ernest Albert, second son of Queen Victoria. The news was published in "The Times" at the unprecedented speed of 40 minutes after the announcement.
Operation.
The Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph consisted of a number of magnetic needles which could be made to turn a short distance either clockwise or anti-clockwise by electromagnetic induction from an energising winding. The direction of movement was determined by the direction of the current in the telegraph wires. The board was marked with a diamond shaped grid with a letter at each grid intersection, and so arranged that when two needles were energised they would point to a specific letter.
The number of wires required by the Cooke and Wheatstone system is equal to the number of needles used. The number of needles determines the number of characters that can be encoded. Cooke and Wheatstone's patent recommends five needles, and this was the number on their early demonstration models. The number of codes that can be obtained from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ... needles is 2, 6, 12, 20, 30 ... respectively.
At the sending end there were two rows of buttons, one button for each coil in each row. The operator selected one button from each row. This connected two of the coils to the positive and negative ends respectively of the battery. The other end of the coils was connected to the telegraph wires and the coils at the receiving station. The other end of the receiving coils, while in receive mode, were all commoned together. Thus the current flowed through the same two coils at both ends and energised the same two needles. With this system the needles were always energised in pairs and always rotated in opposite directions.
Five-needle telegraph.
The five-needle telegraph with twenty possible needle positions was six codes short of being able to encode the complete alphabet. The letters omitted were C, J, Q, U, X and Z. A great selling point of this telegraph was that it was simple to use and required little operator training. There is no code to learn, as the letter being sent was visibly displayed to both the sending and receiving operator.
The Paddington to West Drayton telegraph originally used six wires rather than five, although it was a five-needle system. The sixth wire was to provide a common return so that the needles could be operated independently, thus giving the possibility of more available codes. Using these codes, however, would have required more extensive operator training since the display could not be read on sight from the grid as the simple alphabetic codes were. Telegraph systems were later to use earth return to avoid the need for a return wire, but this principle was not established at the time of Cooke and Wheatstone's telegraph. The economic need to reduce the number of wires in the end proved a stronger incentive than simplicity of use and led Cooke and Wheatstone to develop the two-needle telegraph.
Two-needle telegraph.
The two-needle telegraph required three wires, one for each needle and a common return. The coding was somewhat different from the five-needle telegraph and needed to be learned, rather than read from a display. The needles could move to the left or right either one, two, or three times in quick succession, or a single time in both directions in quick succession. Either needle, or both together, could be moved. This gave a total of 24 codes, one of which was taken up by the stop code. Thus, three letters were omitted: J, Q and Z, which were substituted with G, K and S respectively.
One-needle telegraph.
This system was developed to replace the failing multi-wire telegraph on the Paddington to West Drayton line. It required only two wires, but a more complex code and slower transmission speed. Whereas the two-needle system needed a three-unit code (that is, up to three movements of the needles to represent each letter), the one-needle system used a four-unit code, but had enough codes to encode the entire alphabet. Like the preceding two-needle system, the code units consisted of rapid deflections of the needle to either left or right in quick succession. The needle struck a post when it moved causing it to ring. Different tones were provided for the left and right movements so that the operator could hear which direction the needle had moved without looking at it.
Codes.
The codes were refined and adapted as they were used. By 1867 numerals had been added to the five-needle code. This was achieved through the provision of a sixth wire for common return making it possible to move just a single needle. With the original five wires it was only possible to move the needles in pairs and always in opposite directions since there was no common wire provided. Many more codes are theoretically possible with common return signalling, but not all of them can conveniently be used with a grid indication display. The numerals were worked in by marking them around the edge of the diamond grid. Needles 1 through 5 when energised to the right pointed to numerals 1 through 5 respectively, and to the left numerals 6 through 9 and 0 respectively. Two additional buttons were provided on the telegraph sets to enable the common return to be connected to either the positive or negative terminal of the battery according to the direction it was desired to move the needle.
Also by 1867, codes for Q () and Z () were added to the one-needle code, but not, apparently, for J. However, codes for Q (), Z (), and J () are marked on the plates of later needle telegraphs, together with six-unit codes for number shift () and letter shift (). Numerous compound codes were added for operator controls such as "wait" and "repeat". These compounds are similar to the prosigns found in Morse code where the two characters are run together without a character gap. The two-needle number shift and letter shift codes are also compounds, which is the reason they have been written with an overbar.
The codes used for the four-needle telegraph are not known, and none of the equipment has survived. It is not even known which letters were assigned to the twelve possible codes.

Francis Coquelin

Francis Coquelin (born 13 May 1991) is a French footballer who is currently on loan to Bundesliga club Freiburg from English club Arsenal. He plays as a defensive midfielder, but can also be utilized at right midfield or at right back. Coquelin is a French youth international and currently plays on the under-21 team.
Club career.
Born in Laval, Mayenne, Coquelin began his career playing for AS Laval Bourny before departing in 2005 for the biggest club in the commune, Stade Lavallois. Coquelin spent three years at the club before being spotted by renowned Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi, while on international duty, playing in a 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship elite round qualification match against Israel.
Arsenal.
2008–09 season.
In July 2008, Coquelin joined Arsenal from Stade Lavallois following a successful trial with the club. Although he suffered a thigh injury which cut the trial short, Coquelin impressed and was subsequently offered a deal to stay in North London. Coquelin played for the first team in Arsenal's pre-season matches against Barnet and Szombathelyi Haladás, and made his competitive first team debut for Arsenal in a 6–0 win over Sheffield United on 23 September 2008, coming on as a substitute for Fran Mérida to play at right back. Coquelin scored his first goal in an Arsenal shirt in a reserve match against Stoke City on 6 October 2008, shooting powerfully in from the edge of the box with his weaker left foot.
2009–10 season.
Coquelin was a regular for Arsenal F.C. Reserves during the 2009–10 season, playing 12 times and scoring twice. On 22 September 2009, he made his first start for the first team against West Bromwich Albion in the League Cup third round, playing 58 minutes before he was replaced by Mark Randall. He featured again in the League Cup, this time as a second half substitute for Fran Mérida in the 2–1 victory against Liverpool. Coquelin made a disappointing first FA Cup start in a 3–1 loss to Stoke City. Playing in an unfamiliar right back position, he was substituted in the second half for Aaron Ramsey.
Loan to FC Lorient.
Coquelin opted for a move to FC Lorient on a loan deal that saw him play his football in France throughout the 2010–11 season. He made his Lorient debut as a second-half substitute in the 2–1 home defeat to Nice on 14 August 2010. Coquelin grabbed his first assist as Lorient lost 6–3 to Lille. After beating one Lille player, he played a through ball for Kevin Gameiro for Lorient's opener. Coquelin received his first red card while playing at right back against Valenciennes. He received the second yellow card after a handball decision. Coquelin scored his first goal in professional football as FC Lorient beat Stade Rennais F.C. 2–1, Francis scored the winner from close range after Rennes goalkeeper Nicolas Douchez had spilled a Morgan Amalfitano long range effort. In the latter stages of the season Coquelin was heavy used on the right hand side of midfield. He completed his loan with Lorient making 24 appearances in Ligue 1, one appearance in the Coupe de France and scoring one goal. Sky Sports reported that Lorient manager Christian Gourcuff was keen to re-sign Coquelin as well as his Arsenal team mate Gilles Sunu on an additional year's loan.

The Hamburger Wagon is a hamburger joint located on the sidewalk of the Market Square in Miamisburg, Ohio. The establishment was opened in 1913 by Sherman “Cocky” Porter to help feed residents of Miamisburg rebuilding from the Great Flood. 
The Hamburger Wagon is a small wagon, large enough for only two people to work side by side; one cooks while the other one prepares the buns and handles the money. The wagon, still at approximately the same location where it originated, is rolled away and stored indoors nightly. The establishment has changed ownership hands several times throughout the years, most recently bought by Jack Sperry in September 2008 from Michelle Lyons. Unchanged, however, is the flagship product: small hamburgers cooked by oil in a large skillet and served on a roll with an onion, pickle, salt and pepper. The burger has a crispness on the outside, one for which the owners will not divulge its secret of preparation. 
The Hamburger Wagon was voted Dayton's best burger joint in 2008. It was also recently featured in the book by George Motz, "Hamburger America: A State-By-State Guide to 100 Great Burger Joints."

Oscar Wilde Bookshop

The Oscar Wilde Bookshop was the first bookstore devoted to gay and lesbian authors. It was founded by Craig Rodwell in 1967 as the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop. Initially located at 291 Mercer Street, it moved in 1973 to Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, New York, United States. It is named after gay author Oscar Wilde.
History.
Despite a limited selection of materials when the bookstore was first established, Rodwell refused to stock pornography and instead favored literature by gay and lesbian authors.
In March 1968 Rodwell began publishing a monthly newsletter from the bookshop, calling it HYMNAL.
Early organizing meetings for the first Pride Parade in New York City were held at the bookshop in 1970.
Rodwell sold the bookshop in March 1993 to Bill Offenbaker, three months before Rodwell's death of stomach cancer. In June 1996 Offenbaker sold the store to Larry Lingle. In January 2003 Lingle announced that the bookshop would close due to financial difficulties. Deacon Maccubbin, owner of Lambda Rising bookstores, purchased the bookstore to prevent the historically significant bookstore from closing. "The Advocate" story on the scheduled closing failed to note that the founder of the Oscar Wilde Bookshop was Craig Rodwell, prompting a letter of correction from his former partner and first manager of the bookshop, Fred Sargeant. In 2006, the bookstore was purchased by longtime manager, Kim Brinster.
The bookstore closed on March 29, 2009, due to double-digit declines in sales caused by the economic crisis, according to Brinster. It was part of a spate of LGBT bookstore closures in the early 21st century, including Lambda Rising's Washington store and A Different Light in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Influence of Christian Science.
Rodwell had been brought up in the Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science). The roots of Rodwell's belief in gay liberation arose from his daily readings in Christian Science which stressed "the dignity of all things human and the importance of making things true by believing in them." Using the Christian Science example of community outreach and stressing the availability of literature that contained positive images of gays and lesbians, Rodwell modeled the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop after a Christian Science reading room.

The Dirty Heads

The Dirty Heads is a reggae band from Huntington Beach, CA with a melodic style that includes hip hop and ska punk genres. Their debut album, "Any Port in a Storm", was released on September 23, 2008, by Executive Music Group (Fontana/Universal).
History.
The band was founded in 1996 by Jared “Dirty J” Watson and vocalist/guitarist Dustin “Duddy B” Bushnell in Orange County, CA. The two first met at a party during their freshman year of high school. Upon hearing one of Bushnell’s rap demo tapes, Watson became inspired to collaborate with him on a new project. At the time Bushnell was already in a punk rock band, while Watson had no previous music experience. In Bushnell’s garage, the two began writing hip-hop songs with reggae and punk influences. The band’s name comes from an occasion where the two were stealing a 12-pack of beer, and someone shouted at them “Come here you little dirty heads!”
Later, percussionist Jon Olazabal, drummer Matt Ochoa, and bassist David Foral were added to the lineup, further defining the band’s sound. With a full band, the members started taking their craft seriously and began recording. Renowned record producer Rob Cavallo originally signed the band to Warner Bros., but artistic differences led them to leave the label. The band managed to keep hold of their master recordings through the separation, which make up the bulk of "Any Port in a Storm ". The band then connected with producers Steve Fox and Stan Frazier to complete their debut album. The album features appearances from legendary Beatles collaborator Billy Preston, Josh Freese (drummer for The Vandals and session drummer for Nine Inch Nails and Korn), percussionist Alex Acuna, British Grammy nominated British reggae singer and DJ Tippa Irie,and Indie 103.1 reggae host Native Wayne. The song "Check the Level" includes guitarist Slash and heavy metal vocalist M. Shadows. The album was mixed by Beastie Boys producer Mario C, and Lewis Richards of 17th Street Recording.
The Dirty Heads are perhaps one of the most prominent groups in a sub-genre of reggae heavily influenced by the original incarnation of Sublime. The group first entered the rock/reggae scene when "Ring the Alarm" was chosen as a song on the first Pier Sampler. The band started touring heavily in California, Arizona, and some parts of Mexico before becoming a national touring act. They maintain close ties with groups such as Sublime with Rome.
The Dirty Heads tour the U.S. frequently with bands such as O.A.R., 311, Pepper, Kottonmouth Kings, Unwritten Law, Matisyahu, and Sublime with Rome. The band has also been part of marketing campaigns for Etnies Jeans, Rag Dynasty Shirts, and Vestal Watches. The Dirty Heads were among the first bands featured on YouTube's "RAWsession". The set included a cover of Coldplay's "Viva La Vida."
Their most successful single to date, "Lay Me Down", features vocalist/guitarist Rome Ramirez of Sublime With Rome. The video was directed by Thomas Mignone and premiered on MTV on June 24, 2010.
On March 9, 2012, the song "Spread Too Thin", off their upcoming album "Cabin By The Sea", premiered on KROQ. On the origins of the song, Watson commented, "In the music industry, there are ups-and-downs, and it’s probably more emotionally stressful than physically. So I was talking to my Dad, just about some stuff. I was a little stressed, and he has this funny saying. ‘You’re like a little bit of butter on too much bread.'" 
"Cabin by the Sea" was released on June 19, 2012. The band played several music festivals during Summer 2012, including Catalpa Music Festival on Randalls Island in New York City. 
On July 9, 2013, The Dirty Heads released an acoustic version of the song Cabin By The Sea, recorded with Thepier.org, as a part of their acoustic series.
On July 28, 2013, The Dirty Heads played their largest sold-out show to date in front of 8,500 hometown friends, family, and fans at the Orange County Fair's Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, CA. The emotional stop on their "Cabin By The Sea Tour" ended with a gracious "thank you" from the band for all the local support over the years, including a "trip down memory lane" story of when the band used to play small shows in local Huntington Beach, CA bars to a handful of people.
The Dirty Heads released an 11-track acoustic album, titled "Home - Phantoms Of Summer", on October 29, 2013.

List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in the San Fernando Valley

This is a list of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in the San Fernando Valley, California. It includes Historic-Cultural Monuments in the San Fernando Valley as well as the adjacent Crescenta Valley. In total, there are more than 70 Historic-Cultural Monuments (HCM) in the San Fernando and Crescenta Valleys. A handful of additional historic sites in the valleys have been designated as California Historical Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The sites that are within City of Los Angeles borders are covered by two commissions of the Los Angeles Department of City Planning: the North Valley Area Planning Commission and the South Valley Area Planning Commission.
Overview of the Valley's Historic-Cultural Monuments.
The Historic-Cultural Monuments in the San Fernando Valley are spread across the Valley from Chatsworth in the northwest to Studio City in the southeast, and from the City of Calabasas in the southwest to Tujunga and La Crescenta in the northeast.
When the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board was formed in 1962, its first-designated sites were HCM #1 (Leonis Adobe) and HCM #2 (Bolton Hall), both located in the San Fernando/Crescenta Valleys.
The oldest building in the Valley is the Convento Building at the Mission San Fernando Rey de España, which was built between 1808 and 1822. Other monuments directly related to the Mission San Fernando include the kiln in Chatsworth used to make bricks and tiles for the mission, the wells and settling basin in Sylmar used to supply water to the mission, and the Pioneer Cemetery where Mission Indians as well as Valley pioneers are buried.
In addition to the structures at the Mission, two adobe structures, Rómulo Pico Adobe built in 1834 and Leonis Adobe built in the 1840s, rank among the oldest in the Valley.
Eleven of the monuments located in the Valley have also been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are: Leonis Adobe, Bolton Hall, Rómulo Pico Adobe, the Convento Building at the Mission San Fernando, Campo de Cahuenga, Minnie Hill Palmer House, Los Encinos State Historic Park, Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation, the Old Stage Coach Trail through the Santa Susana Mountains, and the North Hollywood and Van Nuys branch libraries.
Churches and other places of worship are well represented on the list, including the Chatsworth Community Church (1903), Faith Bible Church in Northridge (1917), the Saint Saviour's Chapel at Harvard-Westlake School in Studio City, and the David Familian Chapel at the Valley's first Jewish synagogue in North Hollywood.
The role of trees in the development of the Valley is celebrated with monument listings for a 1,000-year-old oak tree in Encino (removed in 1996), 114 Himalayan Deodar trees along White Oak in Granada Hills, 76 mature olive trees along Lassen Street in Chatsworth, and 300 pepper trees lining in Canoga Avenue in Woodland Hills.
Tower of Pallets.
One of the more unusual items to receive Historic-Cultural Monument status was a tower of 2,000 wooden beer pallets, designated as HCM #184 in 1978. In 1951, Daniel Van Meter built the tower at his property on Magnolia Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, using beer pallets discarded by a nearby Schlitz brewery. Van Meter, who had been convicted in the 1940s under the Subversive Organizations Registration Act and served time in San Quentin, stacked the pallets in concentric circles until he had built a high cone-shaped tower with a winding staircase around the outside. When fire inspectors sought to have the pile demolished as a fire hazard in 1977, Van Meter appealed to the Cultural Heritage Commission, arguing that the tower surrounded a "Tree of Heaven" and the 1869 grave of a Native American child. One Commissioner recalled that Van Meter was "a character," and his tower, which had goats climbing on it, was "a scream." Another commissioner, noted architecture writer Robert Winter recalled that recognizing the stack of crumbling, termite-infested Schlitz beer pallets was "the funniest thing we ever did" and suggested, "Maybe we were drunk."
After Van Meter died in 2000, the pile became the subject of both pride and ridicule. In 2001, columnist Patt Morrison offered the "unforgettable 22-foot-high tower of wooden beer pallets" as a symbol of the Valley's proposed secession movement. The "Los Angeles Times" in 2002 derided the tower: "France can boast of the Eiffel Tower, New York has the Empire State Building, and Sherman Oaks has the Tower of Wooden Pallets." In 2005, Van Meter's heirs sought permission to demolish the tower and develop the site, then valued at $7 million. Van Meter's relatives rejected the contention that the tower was art, instead describing the pile as "a rotting vestige of one man's egotism" that festers "like a sore on the community's body." When no influential preservationists or art scholars came forward to defend the pallets, the Commission allowed the removal of the pallets, and an apartment building was built in its place.

First White House of the Confederacy

The First White House of the Confederacy was the executive residence of President Jefferson Davis and family while the capital of the Confederate States of America was in Montgomery, Alabama. Completely furnished with original period pieces from the 1850s and 1860s, the 1835 Italianate-style house is open to the public. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1974.
In February 1861, shortly after selecting Davis as president, the Provisional Confederate Congress, meeting in Montgomery, authorized the leasing of an executive mansion. An offer came from Colonel Edmund S. Harrison of nearby Prattville, Alabama, who had recently purchased a newly renovated house in Montgomery that had previously been owned by a series of prominent citizens of the city. He offered to rent the house fully furnished and staffed for $5,000 per year.
The house served as the first White House of the Confederacy from February 1861 until late May 1861, when the Confederate capital moved to Richmond, Virginia. During that time, the White House was the setting for many lavish parties and receptions hosted by Mrs. Davis.

Oriental horse

The term oriental horse refers to the ancient breeds of horses developed in the Middle East, such as the Arabian, Akhal-Teke, Barb, and the now-extinct Turkoman horse. They tend to be thin-skinned, long-legged, slim in build and more physically refined than other types, but with great endurance. Oriental horses, sometimes referred to as "hot-blooded" breeds, have a level of intelligence that allows them to be athletic, versatile, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed and are generally considered spirited and bold.
History.
"Oriental" horse, was a tall, slim, refined and agile animal arising in western Asia, adapted to hot, dry climates, and thought to be the progenitor of the modern oriental breeds. Original classification of ancient horse phenotypes was originally based on body types and conformation, prior to the availability of DNA for research, and has since been superseded by modern studies. Prior to these developments, the Four Foundations theory suggested the existence of four basic "proto" horses developed with adaptations to their environment prior to domestication by humans. Another theory suggested that the Oriental horse was a separate species or subspecies (once proposed as "Equus agilis" though modern taxonomy disputes this ever was a true subspecies). However, modern genetic evidence now points at a single domestication event for a limited number of stallions, combined with repeated restocking of wild mares into domesticated herds, making the later divergence of body types a landrace or selective breeding adaption.
Over the centuries, European breeders imported oriental horses from the Middle East and Northern Africa for breeding when they wanted to incorporate characteristic traits into their best horse racing and light cavalry horses. Breeders' use of Arabians, and possibly Barb and Turkoman horses, was instrumental in developing the Thoroughbred breed. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the Andalusian horse shows a clear link to an influx of Barb breeding. Nearly all other breeds of light and warmblood horses have some oriental ancestry, usually through the Arabian.

Franciscan St. Elizabeth Health-Crawfordsville

Franciscan St. Elizabeth Health-Crawfordsville, located in Crawfordsville, Indiana, is a member of the Franciscan Alliance, Inc., hospital system.
History.
The hospital was originally established as Culver Union Hospital by the local chapter of the Women's Union, and opened on 27 November 1902. It was operated by the Union Hospital Association until 1927, when it was transferred to the local county. In 1929 the county completed the construction of a new 45-bed building, at which time the original building was converted into a nurses' residence.
From 1939-1942 a new building was constructed which connected the two older buildings. The original structure dating from 1902 was condemned in 1950 and a new wing for the hospital was completed in 1966. The county sold the hospital in 1983 to American Medical International. That organization built a completely new facility at the hospital's current location. It opened its doors on 13 June 1984.
In 1999 the hospital was purchased by the Sisters of St. Francis Health Services (changed in 2010 to Franciscan Alliance, Inc.) and renamed St. Clare Medical Center, after which a series of expansion of its services was undertaken. In January 2011 the facility was given its current name.
Status.
St. Clare Medical Center is licensed by the Indiana State Board of Health and is a member of the Catholic Health Association of the United States and Canada, the Indiana Hospital Association and the American Hospital Association.

La Sulamite

La Sulamite is a scène lyrique by Emmanuel Chabrier to words by Jean Richepin for solo voice, women's chorus and orchestra. The text of "La Sulamite" is based on extracts from "The Song of Songs".
Background.
"La Sulamite" was first performed on 15 March 1885 at the Concerts Lamoureux, conducted by Charles Lamoureux with the mezzo soloist Mme Marie-Helene Brunet Lafleur (the second wife of Lamoureux), to whom the work is dedicated. A re-orchestrated version made by the composer in 1890 (with a similar dedication) was first performed by the same artists on 21 February 1892; that manuscript is now in The Pierpoint Morgan Library.
Chabrier had great difficulty in finding a convincing ending to the piece, even trying to get Lamoureux to help him. 
In the end though he was pleased with this work; in a letter to his publishers Enoch et Costallat he wrote "I am very attached to this work. It is difficult but will be less so in ten or twenty years from now".
According to Myers, the work has a glowing intensity and sensuous aura, and the writing for voices and instruments is free and uninhibited, enlivened by harmonic subtleties and bold and original modulations.
Debussy confided to the critic and composer Gustave Samazeuilh that he was influenced by "La Sulamite" when writing "La damoiselle élue". Ravel was also an enthusiast, introducing the work to his friend Ricardo Viñes in 1897.
The work.
Within an oriental setting in high-walled gardens, the Sulamite, at first sad because of the absence of her loved one, soon feels his approach, calls him, sees him running and collapses finally in his arms in the longed-for ecstasy, among the delighted congratulations of her companions, happy with her good fortune. 
"La Sulamite" is scored for a large orchestra of piccolo, 2 flutes, oboe, cor anglais, 2 B flat clarinets, bass clarinet, 4 bassoons; 2 horns in F, 2 horns in E flat, 2 pistons in C, 2 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba; timpani, antique cymbals in E flat, triangle, drum, bass drum, cymbals; 2 harps, violins, violas, cellos and double basses. 
The work lasts around 17 minutes.

1991 Chatham Cup

The 1991 Chatham Cup was the 64th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Up to the last 16 of the competition, the cup was run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with an open draw from the quarter-finals on. National League teams received a bye until the third round (last 64). In all, a record 174 teams took part in the competition.
Tawa reached the final 16 by unusual means. They were defeated by New Plymouth Old Boys in the third round, but New Plymouth Old Boys were disqualified after the draw for the final 32 was made, which would have seen them playing against Rongotai College. Tawa were reinstated as winners of the third round match, but Rongotai refused to play against them, claiming that they should have been awarded the match against NPOB by default. Tawa were thus deemed to have won the fourth round game by a walk-over.
The 1991 final.
The league/cup double was completed for the fifth time, with Christchurch United becoming the second club to achieve the feat twice, having previously won the double in 1975. This was the last occasion that the double was won with the old New Zealand National Soccer League, as this was disbanded at the end of the 1992 season.

Sun gun

The sun gun or heliobeam was a theoretical orbital weapon that was researched by Nazi Germany during World War II.
History.
In 1929, the German physicist Hermann Oberth developed plans for a space station from which a 100 metre-wide concave mirror could be used to reflect sunlight onto a concentrated point on the earth.
Development.
Later during World War II, a group of German scientists at a research centre in Hillersleben began to expand on Oberth's idea of creating a superweapon that could utilize the sun's energy. This so-called "sun gun" would be part of a space station 5,100 miles above Earth. The scientists calculated that a huge reflector, made of metallic sodium and with an area of 3.5 square miles, could produce enough focused heat to make an ocean boil or burn a city. After being questioned by Allied officers, the Germans claimed that the sun gun could be completed within 50 or 100 years.
Uses in Popular Culture.
In the film Die Another Day, the twentieth installment in the James Bond series of films, the primary antagonist of the film, fictional British billionaire Gustav Graves, constructs a orbital sun gun code named "Icarus" for the use of cutting a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone and allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea. The device was disabled after the portable control console for it as well as its owner were sent through one of the Turbofan engines of Grave's personal cargo plane.

It circumnavigates the entire Kantō Region through Mount Takao, Okutama, Chichibu, Mount Myōgi, Mount Taihei, Mount Tsukuba, Kasumigaura, Kujūkuri Beach, Bōsō, Miura Peninsula, and Tanzawa, stretching 1,665 km. The 144 routes are laid out to cover natural scenery and pastoral landscapes, as well as cultural and historical sites. Each course, lasting roughly 10 km, links two points accessible by public transportation but does not necessarily connect to the next route.
Courses in Tokyo.
The Tokyo section of the Kantō Fureai Trail begins with the . The section contains seven trails between Takao and Okutama, totaling 74.4 km.
The Lake Path is the first leg of the Kantō Fureai Trail. It offers splendid landscapes of Tsukui Lake and the Sagami River and, from the summit of Mount Shiroyama, views of Sagami Lake, peaks of the Tanzawa Mountain Range, and Mount Fuji. At the crossroads of Umenoki Daira, the trail connects to in Kanagawa Prefecture.
Covering 16.2 km, the trail starts at Umenoki Daira, through Misawa Pass, Ōtarumi Pass, Icchōdaira, and Mount Takao to the end point at Takaosanguchi Station. Points of interest include Ōtarumi Pass (388 m), located on the border between Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture, and Yakuō-in, a temple established in 744. The approach to the temple is also famous for its row of sugi trees, whose age is estimated to be 700 years old.
The Bird Path is a 20 km path that spans from the start point of the Tōkaidō Nature Trail to Mount Jinba through Mount Takao. The area from Mount Keishin to Mount Jinba is inhabited by a wide variety of birds. The summit of Mount Jinba is surrounded by Cherry and Daimyo Oak trees with and provides a great panoramic view of Mount Fuji and the mountains of Tanza and Okutama. The route begins at Takaosan-guchi Station, passing through Mount Takao, Mount Shiroyama, Kobotoke Pass, Mount Keishin, and Mount Jinba, and ends at Jinba Kōgen Bus Stop, roughly taking 7 hours to finish.
This 14.7 hiking trail starts from Wada Pass, passing through Mount Godaikomaru (867m), Mount Shōtō (990 m), Mount Kumakura (1427 m), and to Asama Pass. The rugged route follows the ridge Sasaone, that constitutes a border between Tokyo, Yamanashi Prefecture, and Kanagawa Prefecture. There are views of Mount Fuji between Asama Pass and Mount Shōtō.

Wideband audio

Wideband audio, also known as HD voice, refers to the next generation of voice quality for telephony audio resulting in high definition voice quality compared to standard digital telephony "toll quality". It extends the frequency range of audio signals transmitted over telephone lines, resulting in higher quality speech. The range of the human voice extends from 80 Hz to 14 kHz but traditional, voiceband or narrowband telephone calls limit audio frequencies to the range of 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz. Wideband audio relaxes the bandwidth limitation and transmits in the audio frequency range of 50 Hz to 7 kHz or higher.
History.
In 1987, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standardized a version of wideband audio as G.722. Radio broadcasters began using G.722 over Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) to provide high-quality audio for remote broadcasts, such as from sports venues. AMR-WB (G.722.2) was developed by Nokia and VoiceAge and it was first specified by 3GPP.
The traditional telephone network (PSTN) is generally limited to narrowband audio by the intrinsic nature of its transmission technology, TDM (time-division multiplexing), and by the analogue-to-digital converters used at the edge of the network, as well as the speakers, microphones and other elements in the endpoints themselves.
Wideband audio has been broadly deployed in conjunction with videoconferencing. Providers of this technology quickly discovered that despite the explicit emphasis on video transmission, the quality of the participant experience was significantly influenced by the fidelity of the associated audio signal.
Communications via Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) can readily employ wideband audio. When PC-to-PC calls are placed via VoIP services, such as Skype, and the participants use a high-quality headset, the resulting call quality can be noticeably superior to conventional PSTN calls. Some of the handsets manufactured by Nokia which run S60 and Series40 OS that support VoIP also support wideband audio. A number of audio codecs have emerged to support these services, supplementing G.722.
Manufacturers of audio conferencing equipment have introduced wideband-capable models that include support for G.722 over VoIP.
Conference calls are a direct beneficiary of the enhancements offered by wideband audio. Participants often struggle to figure out who is talking, or to understand accented speakers. Misunderstandings are commonplace due primarily to generally poor audio quality and an accumulation of background noise.
Some listener benefits cited of wideband audio compared to traditional (narrowband):
Despite its reputation for poor audio quality, the mobile telephone industry has started to make some progress on wideband audio. The 3GPP standards group has designated G.722.2 as its wideband codec and calls it Advanced Multirate – Wideband (AMR-WB). A few handsets have been produced supporting this codec (for example, HTC, Nokia , Samsung and Sony, and network demonstrations have been conducted.
Deployment.
As business telephone systems have adopted VoIP technology, support for wideband audio has grown rapidly. Telephone sets from Avaya, Cisco, NEC Unified Solutions, Grandstream, Gigaset, Polycom (which brands wideband audio "HD Voice"), Snom, AudioCodes (which brands wideband audio "HDVoIP") and others now incorporate G.722, as well as varying degrees of higher-quality audio components.
Suppliers of integrated circuits for telephony equipment, including DSP Group, Broadcom, Infineon, and Texas Instruments, include wideband audio in their feature portfolios. There are audio conferencing service providers that support wideband connections from these and other VoIP endpoints, while also permitting PSTN participants to join the conference in narrowband. sipXtapi is an open source solution for VoIP media processing engine supporting wideband and HD voice that provides RTP and codecs through a plugin framework for use with SIP and other VoIP protocols. Skype uses an audio codec called Silk which allows for extremely high quality audio. 
A number of carriers around the world have rolled out HD voice services based on the G.722 wideband standard. In North America, hosted service providers have recently deployed the Aastra Hi-Q upgrade to its installed user base and as of January 2010 claimed around 70,000 HD voice endpoints. Consumer service provider ooma has an estimated 25,000 HD voice endpoints deployed stemming from its roll out of its second-generation Telo hardware.
After years of trials, AMR-WB was made commercially available in September 2009, when Orange launched the world's first high-definition voice service for mobile phones in Moldova, the first time since the 1990s that mobile voice technologies have been subject to a significant evolution. The first mobile handset integrating high-definition voice capability launched by Orange Moldova is the Nokia 6720c, which integrates WB-AMR. Orange has since rolled out HD voice in the UK, France, Belgium, Romania, Armenia, Dominican Republic and Spain, with Switzerland and Luxembourg due to follow. Moreover Orange has announced that will ensure HD Voice interoperability between Orange countries for both mobile and fixed networks, interoperability with other operators and looking to launch HD Voice over their 2G networks as well, by in 2013/2014.

Iván Marcano

Iván Marcano Sierra (born 23 June 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who currently plays for Superleague Greece club Olympiacos on loan from FC Rubin Kazan , mainly as a central defender, he can also play as left back.
Club career.
Santander-born Marcano, a youth graduate of hometown's Racing de Santander, made his first appearance with the main squad in an away win over UD Almería on 30 September 2007, due to injuries in the Cantabria side. However, he had to leave the pitch in the second half of the game, also due to injury, and was unable to play for three months.
For the 2008–09 campaign Marcano was definitely promoted to the first team, under new manager Juan Ramón López Muñiz. In the fifth match he scored his first La Liga and Racing goal, in a 1–2 home loss against RCD Mallorca, and was a regular throughout the campaign, mostly as a left defender.
In early July 2009, Marcano signed a six-year deal with Villarreal CF. He was first-choice for most of the first part of his first season; however, after consecutive poor performances, he fell out of favour, even losing his position in the defensive pecking order to 19-year-old Argentine Mateo Musacchio (originally signed for the B-side).
Deemed surplus to requirements at Villarreal for 2010–11, Marcano was loaned to Getafe CF on 8 June 2010. Benefitting from injuries to both Mario and Rafa, he was regularly used in both defensive positions as the Madrid outskirts team narrowly avoided relegation; on 24 October 2010 he netted his only goal of the season, in a 3–0 home win against Sporting de Gijón.
On 2 June 2012, after one season with Olympiacos F.C. in Greece, where he playing alongside several compatriots – including manager Ernesto Valverde – and was essential in the double conquest, Marcano was sold by Villarreal to FC Rubin Kazan in the Russian Premier League, for about €5 million. In the 2014 winter transfer window, however, he returned to his previous club, on loan until June and with the option to subsequently make the deal permanent.

California Proposition 3 (2008)

Proposition 3 (or the Children's Hospital Bond Act of 2008) is a law that was enacted by California voters by means of the initiative process. It is a bond issue that authorizes $980 million in bonds, to be repaid from state’s General Fund, to fund the construction, expansion, remodeling, renovation, furnishing and equipping of children’s hospitals. The annual payment on the debt authorized by the initiative is approximately $64 million a year. Altogether, the measure would cost about $1.9 billion over 30 years out of California's general fund.
The initiative was presented to the Attorney-General's office in July 2007 and the measure was put to a vote as part of the 4 November 2008 state elections. It now forms Part 6.1 of the Health and Safety Code.
A smaller, but similar, bond measure for hospitals, Proposition 61, was approved by voters in 2004, totalling $750 million. As of June 1, 2008, about $403 million (just over half the total sum) had been spent.
Campaign.
Estimate of fiscal impact.
The Legislative Analyst estimated that the proposed law would cost about $2 billion over thirty years to pay off both the principal ($980 million) and the interest ($933 million) costs of the bonds. Payments of about $64 million per year would be required.
Supporters.
The official committee supporting the initiative was called the California Children's Hospital Association Initiative Fund. The campaign to enact the measure was largely supported by hospitalsall donors to the campaign of over $5,000 were such institutions. It was argued that passing the initiative would help provide the hospitals with enough money for greater bed capacity and to purchase important equipment as well as the most modern technologies. The "Los Angeles Times" editorialized in favor. Arno Political Consultants was paid about $1,028,000 to conduct the petition drive that qualified the measure for the ballot.
Opponents.
The National Tax Limitation Committee, chaired by Lew Uhler, was the official committee opposed to the measure. The "Appeal-Democrat" and the "Pasadena Star News" editorialized against the measure. Against the measure it was argued that

<doc id="19447700" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19447700" title="2002 NFL Expansion Draft">
2002 NFL Expansion Draft

The 2002 National Football League Expansion Draft was the most recent National Football League (NFL) draft in which a new expansion team, named the Houston Texans, selected its first players. On October 6, 1999, in Atlanta, NFL owners had unanimously voted to award the 32nd NFL franchise and the Super Bowl XXXVIII to the city of Houston, Texas. So that the Texans could become competitive with existing teams, the league awarded the Texans the first pick in the 2002 NFL Draft and gave them the opportunity to select current players from existing teams. That selection was provided by the expansion draft, held on February 18, 2002.
In this draft, held months before the regular draft, the existing franchises listed players from which the Texans could select to switch to the new team. This was the third expansion draft after the NFL had instituted the salary cap, which limited the total amount teams could spend on the their roster of players. Teams placed many quality players on the list who had large contracts, as the Texans were required to assume the contracts of those players if selected. The list included 155 NFL players, 25 of whom were Pro Bowl players. The draft took place live and aired on ESPN. The Texans drafted a total of nineteen players. They selected three players with a total salary-cap value of $14.9 million from the Jacksonville Jaguars, who were $23 million over the cap; three players with a total salary-cap value of $14.1 million from the New York Jets, who were $16 million over the cap; and two players with a total salary-cap value of $7.1 million from the Baltimore Ravens, who were $23 million over the cap. 
Rules of the Draft.
Process.
Each NFL team listed five players that the Texans could select, and the Texans were required to claim either 30 players or $27.2 million in contracts (38% of the 2002 salary cap). After the Texans selected a player from an existing team, that team could remove a player from their remaining list. If a second player was taken, the existing team could then pull back its remaining two players. However, teams were not required to remove players from the draftable list, resulting in three Jets and three Jaguars being drafted to the Texans. The Texans were prohibited from selecting a player from a team and trading the player back to that club.
Player limitations.
Existing teams were not allowed to put punters or kickers on the list, nor any player from their 2001 roster who would have become an unrestricted free agent in 2002. They could not list players who went on injured reserve during the 2001 summer's training camp nor any player who would become a restricted free agent after the 2001 season. Their list could include only one player with more than 10 years' experience.
Salary cap ramifications.
The Texans assumed the contracts of the players they selected, including all future portions of their signing bonuses and any guarantees or other terms. If the Texans cut a selection and he re-signed with his old team, the existing team re-assumed his signing bonus. Extra bonuses that did not count against the Texans' salary cap were given to veteran players who were selected. Those selected received $10,000 immediately, an additional $20,000 bonus for reporting to training camp, and another $30,000 for making the active roster during the regular season.

Dark Horse (novel)

Dark Horse is a 2008 novel by conservative activist Ralph Reed.
Plot summary.
The book is set in an unknown election year in the near future (dialogue suggests that it is either the 2016 or 2020 election). It begins at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, where there has been an extremely tight race for the nomination over California Governor Robert W. Long and Senate Majority Leader Salmon Stanley, and there has been much controversy over the Virginia delegation for both candidates, and which one was legitimate under Primary Rules. Because of a last minute betrayal by Long supporter Tennessee Governor Terry Tinford to Stanley (under the impression he would be "seriously considered" as the VP nominee), Stanley is able to win the nomination with a razor thin margin 2,221 delegates to Long's 2,117. After an outraged Long rejects Stanley's proposal to be his running mate, he selects Governor of Pennsylvania Betsy Hafer as his running mate (much to Tinford's disgust).
A stressed out Jay Noble (the campaign manager of Long) takes a vacation to Mexico, where he meets a very attractive Nicole Dearborn, a democratic activist. After spending several days in Mexico, he gets a call from Long, saying to meet him at the campaign headquarters because he is considering running as an Independent.
Meanwhile, the Stanley campaign is suffering crippling blows by an FBI investigation over an alleged payment by the campaign to give favorable testimony to the credential committee regarding the Virginia delegation by campaign manager Michael Kaplan. Hafer also makes repeated gaffes on the campaign trail, much to Stanley's embarrassment.
As this is going on, the Republican National Convention is set to get underway in Miami. Vice President Harris Flaherty is the nominee for the Republican Party, and he is debating whom to choose as his running mate. The President (who is never named) encourages Flaherty to make a smart decision for VP.
Evangelical radio host Andy Stanton is meeting with top officials of the Flaherty campaign, attempting to encourage Flaherty not to pick Secretary of State David Petty as the VP, on the grounds that he is a pro-choice moderate who would infuriate the Evangelical vote. He then has a hostile meeting with Petty, only furthering his distaste for him. He is assured by campaign manager Bill Diamond that Petty will not be chosen. Stanton is satisfied, and waits for the announcement.
Flaherty surprises everyone when he picks Petty, and an infuriated Stanton releases a statement criticizing Petty on certain issues the day he is set to make his acceptance speech.
As the convention is set to get underway, Long officially announces his Independent candidacy, as succeeds in getting on the ballot in California. Because of this split within the Democratic party, Flahery has a 15 point lead over Stanley going into the convention, all but ensuring a landslide victory for the republicans. After the convention, a confident republican ticket emerges expecting victory going into the election.
Unknown to either parties, Rassem El Zafarshan, an Iranian terrorist, is planning an assassination attempt on both members of the republican ticket. He succeeds in shooting down Marine Two and killing Flaherty, but Petty is in a bulletproof limousine at the time of the shooting. Zafarshan escapes the U.S., all but one terrorist is killed (the one is taken into custody), and the President debates on whether or not to invade Iran.
As the nation mourns, a deeply divided republican party is split on whether or not to elevate Petty to the Presidency nomination. Senator Tom Reynolds, a deeply convicted conservative, originally emerges as the candidate for conservatives, but withdraws because of his desires to be selected as the running mate. Petty is nominated easily, but liberal Senator Ed Bell of Colorado is nominated as VP, and the conservatives walk out on Petty, stating that voting for Long is a serious possibility. The President appoints Petty as the Vice President.
Meanwhile, Long sues the Texas Supreme Court for ballot access unsuccessfully, but is able to win in the Court of Appeals, effectively getting him on the ballot in all 50 states. In order to win the Evangelical vote, Long announces political veteran and Catholic Jonny Whitehead as his running mate, and changes his position to pro-life on abortion.
After a phenomenal performance in the debates, Long wins the most electors, but does not win enough to win the election, so the election is forced to the United States House of Representatives. After the President chooses not to interfere in the House Vote, Long convinces West Virginia and Pennsylvania to cast their vote for him, giving him the Presidency. The Senate then gives the Vice Presidency to Whitehead over Ed Bell.
Jay Noble decides not to want a job in the administration, and becomes an outside supporter. The book ends 14 days prior to Long's inauguration.

Jonathan Dwyer

Jonathan Avery Dwyer (born July 26, 1989) is an American football running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League. He was drafted by the Steelers in the sixth round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Georgia Tech.
High school career.
Dwyer was highly recruited coming out of Kell High School in Marietta, Georgia. He was a four star prospect and many of the top NCAA Division I football programs expressed interest. In track, he finished second in the state in the Class AAAAA 100 meters as a junior, with a time of 10.81 seconds, the second best time in the state of Georgia, and recorded a 4.48 in the 40 yard dash. Dwyer was awarded Georgia's Player of the Year (football). He initially made a soft verbal commitment to the Florida Gators but then decided that he preferred to stay closer to his family and committed to Georgia Tech.
College career.
2007.
After committing to Georgia Tech, Dwyer got plenty of playing time as the backup running back to senior Tashard Choice. He played in all thirteen games during his freshman year. Choice battled leg injuries during the course of the 2007 season, which led to Dwyer rushing for 436 yards on 82 attempts and nine touchdowns. He was named to the ACC All-Freshman Team.
2008.
Dwyer was named as a candidate for the Doak Walker award, an award given to the nation's best running back. Through the first four games of the 2008 season, Dwyer had 389 rushing yards on just 48 attempts with four touchdowns. Against Mississippi State, he recorded the longest touchdown from the line of scrimmage in Georgia Tech history, running for an 88-yard touchdown. He continued to have a good season with 147 yards against a tough Florida State defense, with a 36-yard touchdown run and a 66-yard touchdown. The following week, in a disappointing loss to the North Carolina Tar Heels, Dwyer recorded 157 yards on the ground, 85 of them coming in a long touchdown run where he again displayed his speed. Against Miami in a Thursday night game, Dwyer had 10 carries for 128 yards on the ground with runs of 35 yards and a 58-yard touchdown. The following week, he had a 60-yard touchdown, as well as a 23-yard touchdown against Georgia. He ended the game with 144 yards on the ground against a tough SEC defense and proved that he was one of the top backs in the country. He was the ACC player of the year and was a unanimous first-team selection as well as being the #1 rusher in the ACC with 1,328 yards rushing and 12 touchdowns.
2009.
Former Yellow Jackets running back Tashard Choice said that Dwyer would have a great season in 2009: "He's going to be among the leading rushers in the country next year, and if he stays healthy, he could lead the nation in rushing. He's that good." On January 11, 2010, Dwyer announced he had decided to enter his name in the 2010 NFL Draft and forgo his senior season.
Professional career.
Pre-draft.
Dwyer entered the 2010 NFL Draft and was at one point considered to be a top 30 prospect and in the top 3 running backs in the draft according to Todd McShay. He was questioned if he could adjust to playing in a pro-style offense, due to the fact that he spent most of his college career playing in a flexbone spread option offense at Georgia Tech. Dwyer's stock began to fall as questions about his weight and conditioning arose, including notably after the NFL combine (40 yard dash: 4.59, 3-Cone Drill: 7.56, 20-yard shuttle: 4.67, Bench: 15 reps). Dwyer tested positive for amphetamines at the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine, however it was later ruled exempt by the NFL after it was found that the positive test stemmed from his attention deficit disorder (ADD) medicine.
Pittsburgh Steelers.
Dwyer was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the sixth round (188th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. On September 5, 2010, Dwyer made the team's final roster cut.
2010 season.
Dwyer made his professional debut in week 17 against the Cleveland Browns after the Steelers had built a commanding first half lead and rested Rashard Mendenhall in the second half. He rushed for 28 yards on 9 carries in the game.
2011 season.
Dwyer again made the final roster cut after a strong showing in the pre-season. In the final game in pre-season, he rushed for 88 yards and got reps with the first team offense.
With Rashard Mendenhall nursing a hamstring injury and backup Mewelde Moore out with a foot injury, Dwyer made his 2011 debut against the Tennessee Titans in week 5. He had a strong performance, rushing for 107 yards on 11 carries, including a 76-yard dash to set up a short Ben Roethlisberger touchdown pass. Dwyer and Isaac Redman combined for over 170 yards rushing on the day and the Steelers rolled to a 38-17 victory, despite Tennessee entering the contest with the best scoring defense in the league.
2012 season.
At the start of the 2012 season, Dwyer came to Training camp (National Football League) overweight, and was in question of making the team for his third season. However, he was able to bring down his weight and make the final roster cut for the Steelers.
With Rashard Mendenhall and Isaac Redman out with injuries in a week 7 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Dwyer started the game for the Steelers. He rushed 17 times for 122 yards in the game. The following week, Dwyer had 17 carries for 107 yards against the Washington Redskins. He became the first Steelers running back since Willie Parker in the 2008-2009 season to have consecutive 100-yard games. On November 27, 2012, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin announced that Dwyer had earned the starting job for the remainder of the season. In the December 2 game against the Baltimore Ravens, he scored his first career touchdown on a 16-yard run.
2013 season.
Dwyer was released by the Steelers prior to the start of the 2013 season. However, on September 9, 2013, the Steelers re-signed him due to LaRod Stephens-Howling suffering a torn ACL during their season opening game against the Tennessee Titans.
Personal.
Dwyer is married to Kayla Dwyer and they recently had their first child, a boy Jonathan Dwyer, Jr., a.k.a. "JJ". Dwyer, Sr. is the son of Tony and Keely Dwyer. While attending Georgia Tech he majored in Management. Dwyer is a member of the class of 2007 at Carlton J. Kell High School.

Last Man Standing (NCIS)

"Last Man Standing" is the first episode of the sixth season of the American police procedural drama "NCIS", and the 114th episode overall. It originally aired on CBS in the United States on September 23, 2008. The episode is written by Shane Brennan and directed by Tony Wharmby, and was seen live by 18.03 million viewers.
In the fifth season finale, Lauren Holly's character, Director Jenny Shepard, was killed off in a gun fight following Holly's decision to leave the show. Shortly afterwards, the new director disbands the team, presumably as a form of punishment for failing to prevent Shepard's death. The premiere picks up four months later and follows Gibbs' efforts to adjust while still hoping that Tony, Ziva, and McGee will be allowed to return; it also initiates a new story arc surrounding a mole in the agency that was developed later in the season.
Plot.
The episode opens showing Ziva in a Moroccan bar, dressed up and singing "Temptation" by Tom Waits. It quickly becomes clear that she is undercover, and after a subject of interest leaves abruptly, a bomb explodes, destroying the room.
Gibbs is struggling to adjust to a new team after Director Vance scattered his previous one, sending McGee to the cyber crimes unit, Ziva to Israel, and deploying DiNozzo on a carrier ship. He is unsatisfied with Keating (Jonathan Mangum), Langer (Jonathan LaPaglia), and Lee (Liza Lapira), the agents assigned to him, feeling their personalities to be incompatible and their skills mediocre. Abby, who has crafted photo collages of Ziva, Tony, and McGee, pleads with him to get them back.
They are called to investigate the case of a murdered petty officer, and Ducky determines that the killer had covered the victim's face with a pillow before shooting him, leading them to believe that the perpetrator is inexperienced or reluctant to kill.
Shortly afterwards, Gibbs and the new team discover that the case is connected to a bombing in Morocco. While viewing ZNN news footage covering the aftermath of the bombing, Gibbs recognizes an injured Ziva being carried out on a stretcher from the ruins of the bar. He frantically attempts to contact her, and McGee is able to supply the phone number of her father, Eli David (Michael Nouri). Ziva, who is alive and recovering, explains the purpose of her undercover assignment over the phone and admits to missing the team.
During the phone conversation, Gibbs finds that Vance was involved in Ziva's undercover case; when Gibbs asks Vance about it, the latter admits that he separated the team for the purpose of locating a mole that is in NCIS. McGee begins investigating Gibbs' team when they find that their victim had been calling Agent Lee, only for her to dispute it and say he was asking for legal advice. Tony is then asked by McGee and Gibbs to hack information to find the mole; Gibbs and Vance learn of Palmer's relationship with Lee, solidifying her alibi.
Langer and Keating become anxious when they realize that their bank records are being viewed, and Lee informs them that they are being investigated. As Vance and Gibbs begin to interrogate Keating, Langer and Lee decide to "check out" the computer archive center, despite it being prohibited. Moments later, Gibbs gets a frantic call from Lee, claiming that Langer is the mole. Gunshots are heard through the phone, and they rush to help her, finding a frightened Lee and dead Langer.
To Abby's delight, Vance begins to reverse the disbanding of the original team: McGee is reassigned to Gibbs' team, and Eli David agrees to allow Ziva to return to agency. In a private conversation, Eli tells Vance, "Use her well, Leon. Ziva is the sharp end of the spear."
Agent Lee leaves to return to her old position; however, in private, Lee receives a text asking "Do they suspect?" and it is revealed through a brief sequence of flashbacks that she was the mole.
Production.
The episode was written by Shane Brennan, who was executive producer at the time, and directed by Tony Wharmby. The premiere date was announced on June 26, 2008.
"NCIS" underwent casting changes, some brief and others permanent, to accommodate the plot; Rocky Carroll was promoted to a series regular to replace Lauren Holly's character as the agency's director. Several weeks before "Last Man Standing" aired, it was announced that Jonathan Magnum, Liza Lapira and Jonathan LaPaglia would appear as Gibbs' replacement team, playing the roles of NCIS agents Daniel T. Keating, Michelle Lee, and Brent Langer respectively. However, it was confirmed that Michael Weatherly, Sean Murray, and Cote de Pablo would still appear. The episode also marks the first appearances of Michael Rivkin (Merik Tadros) and Ziva's father, Eli David (Michael Nouri), both of whom play a pivotal role in the season's finale arc.
A photo of Cote de Pablo's character, Ziva, appearing as a bar singer undercover became a subject of interest before the episode aired. Brennan addressed questions raised: "Without giving away too many secrets, the answer to why Ziva is dressed in a sexy, backless dress and singing in a smoky bar will be answered in the opening moments of the season 6 premiere, so fans won’t have to wait long to find out the 'why' of it. But I can divulge one more piece of the puzzle: the 'where' of it. The bar is in Morocco. And did I mention that in the opening episode a member of Gibbs' team gets blown away?"
Cote de Pablo, who performed in the theatre prior to joining "NCIS", supplied all of the vocals during the scene in which Ziva sings while undercover in a bar. She admitted that she had initially been opposed to the scene and was reluctant to sing on the show at all, saying, "They've been toying with the idea for maybe two years of having Ziva sing. From the beginning, I said, 'No way.' I think literally you'd be jumping the shark. What else do we have left here? Let's make the character tap dance and sing...Then Shane (Brennan) clearly put it in a way I couldn't resist." She added that the costuming was radically different from what the "low-maintenance" Ziva is typically shown wearing: "We added a dress. We heightened the eyes a little bit. They gave me sultry, jazz music to sing along to and that in itself is such a different thing for the character."
De Pablo later did a full performance of "Temptation" that was released with the "NCIS: The Official TV Soundtrack" album on February 10, 2009.
Reception.
Ratings.
"Last Man Standing" was seen live by 18.03 million viewers. As a result, it was up in viewers compared to the previous episode, the fifth season finale, as well as the most watched CBS primetime show during the week of September 22–28, 2008. Shortly after the episode aired, it was reported, "NCIS has been a consistent ratings leader and is one of the few prime time dramas that continues to gain viewership as it ages." It was also noted that the show drew more viewers than in the previous season premiere, while, "House", its main competitor at the time, drew fewer.
Critical Reviews.
"Last Man Standing" was generally received well. Allison Waldman from AOL TV summarized the episode: "So, it turns out that Vance is smarter than we thought and the break up wasn't a punishment but a strategy cooked up by the director to get Jethro to flush out a spy in NCIS. The fact that Lee appears to be the double agent, and that Gibbs and Vance seemingly believe that she killed the 'real' spy -- Langer -- is part of a larger story." She also praised Cote de Pablo's singing and the scenes depicting McGee working in cyber crimes. Allison Stein from FireFox News wrote, "Season premiere taunts us with a sexy siren song, double-secret probation, and a traitor on the new team...The script is solid and the acting is excellent as always, the tension level is consistently high, and the story arc promises many surprises as the season progresses."

<doc id="19448002" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19448002" title="Riley &amp; Scott Mk III">
Riley &amp; Scott Mk III

The Riley & Scott Mark III (Mk III) was a sports prototype auto racing car developed by Bob Riley, Bill Riley, and Mark Scott of Riley & Scott Cars Inc.. Initially designed in 1993, the car was created for the World Sports Car (WSC) category which was to debut in the North American IMSA GT Championship during their 1994 season. It was not until 1995 that the first Mk III was completed, but the construction of further cars allowed a variety of teams to campaign in several North American and European racing series, including competing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
In 1999, Riley & Scott evolved the Mk III's designs in order to adapt to the newer Le Mans Prototype (LMP) regulations which were now used in several series. An all new third design officially known as the Mark III Series C debuted in 2001 as the final variant developed by the company before they moved onto other programs. Several private teams also made their own modifications to their Mk IIIs in attempts to improve the car's performance to suit their own needs.
The original Mk IIIs were used in competition until the end of 2002, in the process accumulating 47 overall race victories in both North American and Europe, as well as championship titles in the IMSA GT Championship, United States Road Racing Championship, Rolex Sports Car Series, and American Le Mans Series. Mk III Cs continued to compete until 2005, although they were never able to achieve victories like their earlier predecessor.
Development history.
In 1993, Bill Riley began initial work on a design for a sports prototype to meet the International Motor Sports Association's (IMSA) World Sports Car regulations. The new regulations, announced during the 1993 and intended to be debut in the 1994 season, sought low-cost open-cockpit prototypes to replace the expensive closed-cockpit GTP models used in the IMSA GT Championship. Riley & Scott, already experienced constructors in the Trans-Am Series, were looking to enter the sports prototype category of motorsports.
The new car, known as the Mk III, featured a radical design with tapered rear sidepods that flowed into the rear wing mounts. This opened a large amount of empty space around the rear wheels and exposing much of the floor of the chassis. Radiators for cooling were all placed at the front of the car, under a simple sloping nose. Interest in this design was however low, and Riley & Scott did not construct a car for the 1994 season. During that same year, Dyson Racing contracted Riley & Scott to aid in improving the team's current WSC car, a Spice DR3 chassis with a Ferrari engine. After completing the improvements for Dyson, Bob and Bill Riley returned to their Mk III design with new knowledge from their Dyson experience. After the Mk III was redesigned, Riley & Scott were able to convince Dyson Racing to replace their Spice-Ferrari with two new Mk IIIs for the 1995 season.
Bill Riley's redesigned Mk III was simpler in its design, allowing more variety for customers as well as a low cost. Although the extreme aerodynamics of the original design were gone, the car was conceived to be fast enough to compete for overall wins. The redesign and eventual construction of the first car took only four months. The chassis featured a steel tube frame with panels made of carbon fiber. Behind the cockpit the engine bay was designed to be large enough to allow for a variety of naturally aspirated engines, mostly the V8s of Ford, Chevrolet, and Oldsmobile that were common amongst IMSA GT privateers. All cars used a 5-speed transmission. The suspension consisted of double wishbones with coil springs attached by a pushrod. A power steering system was also part of the standard Mk III.
The redesigned carbon fiber and kevlar bodywork of the Mk III was developed by aircraft designer John Roncz, who assisted Bob Riley in using early computational fluid dynamics programs to refine the aerodynamics of the new car. Final aerodynamic testing was performed at a Lockheed windtunnel. The nose of the final Mk III was very similar to the original design model from 1993, featuring a nose which sloped downward towards a splitter extended from the front of the car. In the center, a wide intake allowed air into the radiator mounted flat under the nose. The air exited the radiator from two openings on top of the nose and in front of the cockpit. Between these exit vents, teams had the option of installing extra headlights for night races. A circular duct was placed on either side of the radiator intake to allow air to the front brakes for cooling. Behind the front wheels the bodywork was now relatively square and flat, with full sidepods running the full width of the car. A rules-mandated full width roll hoop was positioned behind cockpit. Positioned under the roll hoop was an arched intake for the engine airbox.
On the sidepods several square holes were created in order to allow teams to adjust their cooling and aerodynamics dependent upon circuits and conditions. The squares could be filled with bodywork of various shapes and sizes effectively closing or opening the holes as much as the team wished. At the back of the car, the bodywork ended immediately behind the rear wheels, with only the rear wing placed beyond the end of the bodywork. Overall, the aerodynamics of the Mk III were designed to be low in drag, but still offer large amounts of downforce.
In total, 17 Mk IIIs were built by Riley & Scott from 1995 until 1998, with a price of approximately $285,000 for a chassis sans engine. In 1999, Riley & Scott continued their development of the Mk III by created a second series of Mk IIIs. These cars had minor alterations, and a further four chassis were built to this specification. Several teams, hoping to remain competitive with the Mk III, also upgraded their cars to match the Series 2 specifications.
Mk III C.
Riley & Scott had ended their progressing development of the Mk III during the 1999 season, in part due to the company being contracted by General Motors (GM) to construct a Le Mans Prototype for their Cadillac brand. The resulting Northstar LMP borrowed elements of the Mk III's design and layout. Modern features were however included on the Cadillac, including a carbon fiber monocoque replacing the composite monocoque of the Mk III, a roll hoop over only the driver's seat instead of the full width of the cockpit, and a relocation of the radiators to lower the nose. An evolved Riley & Scott-built Northstar LMP design appeared in 2001, but the company was not contracted to build the 2002 version of the car.
Once the Northstar LMPs for the 2001 season were completed, Riley & Scott turned their attention back to their Mk III which were still earning victories even without major upgrades in nearly two seasons. Rather than evolving a design which was now six years old, Riley & Scott chose to start from scratch and develop an all-new car which continued the Mk III's simple design, but received some of the advancements that Riley & Scott had used on the Northstar LMP.
At its most basic the Mk III Series C is nearly identical to the Mk III in terms of its layout. At the front, a slanted nose housed a radiator fed air from a vent above the front splitter, and exiting over the top of the bodywork just in front of the cockpit. The sidepods were straight and flat and featured a variety of exchangeable panels for cooling and aerodynamics. An engine intake was mounted behind and above the cockpit, and shrouded an engine bay which could accept multiple naturally aspirated engine designs. Also shared with the Mk III was the use of a steel tube frame and carbon fiber chassis, rather than the all-carbon monocoque used by the Northstar LMP.
Some notable changes to the design of the Mk III for the Mk III C were concentrated on the cockpit and nose areas. While the Mk III had a roll hoop which ran the full width of the cockpit, the Mk III C was designed to share the roll hoop design of the Northstar LMP. This standard hoop was positioned immediately behind the drivers seat and integrated the intakes for the engine, although an option roll hoop extension was offered as it was required for the Rolex Sports Car Series. The front of the cockpit was also redesigned, as an aerodynamic windshield was added immediately in front of the driver.
The nose of the Mk III C was notably more rounded than the Mk III. The front fenders were no longer square, and tapered as they extended to the front splitter. The headlights were also redesigned, including four lights instead of the previous two. The exits for the radiator were also designed to run the full width of the nose, although the openings were now slimmer than they had been on the Mk III. A new addition was further ducting located on either side of the cockpit designed to allow air from the front diffuser to exit upwards and over the top of the bodywork. The bodywork in general was also lower on the Mk III C, with exception of the vehicle's fenders.
Mechanically, the Mk III C's transmission was a major improvement from the older car. A new 6-speed gearbox built by X-Trac was part of the package, replacing the previous 5-speed. This gearbox was further enhanced by the option of a pneumatically actuated gear change system developed by Megaline which was activated by paddles behind the steering wheel, rather than by a traditional gear stick.
In total, five Mk III Cs were constructed by Riley & Scott, although only four were used for competition purposes. Autocon Motorsports' Mk III C, chassis #01-002, was the last car still in use by time it was retired at the end of 2005.
Racing history.
1995 – 1997.
In early January 1995, Dyson Racing's first Mk III took its first laps of the Daytona International Speedway in testing for the 24 Hours of Daytona later that month. The team's pilots set the fourth fastest time, behind a trio of Ferrari 333 SPs, but ahead of the brand two new Porsche WSC-95 prototypes. For the race itself Rob Dyson, James Weaver, Scott Sharp, and Butch Leitzinger were assigned to the car and successfully qualified sixth. The race would however be short-lived as the Ford engine failed after only eleven laps. In March, the team entered the 12 Hours of Sebring, and improved their qualifying record with a fifth place starting position. The Mk III was able to survive this endurance race and finish for the first time, earning 37th position.
Dyson's second Mk III-Ford was completed by the Grand Prix of Atlanta in April, but it was the first chassis in which James Weaver achieved victory, giving Riley & Scott their first victory as a constructor in only their third IMSA GT event. The season further improved as the team's second chassis won three consecutive races at Watkins Glen, Sears Point, and Mosport, as well as earning the Mk III's first pole position at the Mosport event. Dyson Racing ended the debut season with the Mk III by finishing first and second at New Orleans. James Weaver finished second in the Drivers Championship, two points behind Ferrari driver Fermín Vélez.
After a successful debut season, several teams purchased Mk IIIs for 1996. General Motors instigated the use of Oldsmobile Aurora V8s by the Riley & Scott-backed Doyle Racing, Dyson returned with their two entries. Doyle Racing immediately showed the potential of the Mk III-Oldsmobile combination by winning both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. Fighting throughout the season with the various Ferrari and Riley & Scott teams, Doyle won two further events before Dyson Racing ended the season with three straight victories. Doyle Racing's Wayne Taylor earned the WSC Drivers Championship, while Oldsmobile was able to win the Manufacturers Championship. Doyle's Mk III-Oldsmobile was also flown to Europe that season to participate in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The team qualified ninth, but a transmission problem forced the car to retire after fourteen hours.
The 1997 season began for Riley & Scott in the same way the 1996 season had, with a second consecutive victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona, this time earned by Dyson Racing. Ferrari was however able to prevent a similar repeat win at the 12 Hours of Sebring, but Dyson rebounded with five wins in the nine remaining races in the 1997 season to win the WSC Teams Championship. Dyson's Butch Leitzinger won the Drivers Championship and Ford secured the Manufacturers Championship, giving Riley & Scotts a clean sweep of the series.
1998 – 2000.
1998 was a year in which the racing campaign of the Mk III blossomed. Dyson Racing was joined by Matthews-Colucci Racing, Intersport Racing, and Transatlantic Racing in running not only the IMSA GT Championship, but also the new United States Road Racing Championship (USRRC). Riley & Scott was not able to win a third successive 24 Hours of Daytona in USRRC, but Dyson Racing won the next three races and ended the five race season with a Teams Championship, a Manufacturers Championship for Ford, and a Drivers Championship for James Weaver. In IMSA GT, Dyson also won three events and secured second consecutive Drivers Championships for Butch Leitzinger and Constructors Championships for Ford, but failed to win the Teams Championship against the Doyle-Risi Racing Ferrari. A fourth Riley & Scott IMSA GT victory was also achieved by the BMW-supported Team Rafanelli of Italy, who were also among a trio of teams using Mk IIIs in the European International Sports Racing Series (ISRS) and supported by Riley & Scott's European arm. The French Solution F team of Philippe Gache earned the marque's first success outside North American by winning the final 1998 round at Kyalami, South Africa and finishing the season third in the Teams Championship.
Riley & Scott launched their revised Series 2 Mk III in 1999 and the company immediately returned to victory, winning the 24 Hours of Daytona for the third time in four years. Dyson's victory was followed by another in the third race of the USRRC season, but that was enough for Dyson's drivers Butch Leitzinger and Elliot Forbes-Robinson to be crowned champions due to the rest of the season being canceled. The IMSA GT Championship had also recently ceased to exist but had since been replaced by the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) for 1999. Dyson opened the ALMS season by finishing only nine seconds behind the winning BMW Motorsport entry at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Team Rafanelli followed this by winning the next ALMS round at Road Atlanta. The rest of the ALMS season was dominated by the BMW and Panoz entries, but consistent finishes for Dyson Racing allowed Elliot Forbes-Robinson to win his second Drivers Championship of 1999.
Outside North America, the Mk III did not have as successful of a season. Target 24, Solution F, and RWS Motorsport all contested the ISRS, now renamed the Sports Racing World Cup, but none of the three were able to win races. Solution F also entered two Mk IIIs in the 24 Hours of Le Mans alongside the Japanese Autoexe's team's car (relabeled as an "Autoexe LMP99"). However, all three cars were retired from the race after only 74 laps. The Autoexe's "LMP99" later participated in the Le Mans Fuji 1000 km, but ran out of gasoline during the race.
In 2000, Riley & Scott's attention moved from the Mk III to their new Cadillac Northstar LMP program in partnership with General Motors. Although this meant that upgrades to the Mk III were scarce, the cars were still strong competitors. After the USRRC dissolved, the Rolex Sports Car Series was formed to take its place. Dyson Racing entered the Rolex Series, but newcomer Robinson Racing, using a new Mk III with a Judd V10 engine, was able to win in the second race of the season. A further victory was added to Robinson's total, but Dyson's four victories later that season allowed them to once again win the Teams Championship, and James Weaver earned yet another Drivers Championship from piloting the Mk III. Robinson's efforts earned them third in the Rolex Teams Championship. In the ALMS, Dyson chose not to return, leaving the German Pole Team as the sole Riley & Scott entrant over the year. The team's best result was an eighth place finish, but following European rounds the team decided not to return to North America for the rest of the year. In the Sports Racing World Cup, two Italian teams campaigned for Riley & Scott. The R & M Mk III, also using a Judd V10, won the team's home race at Monza, but reliability problems over the rest of the season left them fifth in the Teams Championship.
2001 – 2005.
In 2001, the lifetime of the original Mk III was nearing its end. By April, Dyson had earned a sole Rolex Series victory at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but in April the Riley & Scott program was rejuvenated. Having completed their year of running the Cadillac squad, Riley & Scott had returned to development of the Mk III and were completing their latest evolution. Dyson received the first Mk III C, but rather than remain in the Rolex Series, the new car made its debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in the American Le Mans Series. The new car finished in fifth place in its first race, but quickly improved that performance with a podium finish at the Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio. For the Rolex Series, Dyson and Robinson Racing initially campaigned their older Mk IIIs, but Robinson Racing received the second new Mk III Cs in time for the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The car's debut was however short lived as a heavy accident in practice required a lengthy reconstruction. Dyson still proved the old car was able to succeed, winning four more Rolex races. Robinson's damaged Mk III C was able to be repaired in order to make its race debut at the last event of the season, finishing in third place. Even with the Mk III in the process of being replaced, Dyson still won the Teams Championship and James Weaver earned his second straight Rolex Series Drivers Championship.
By the start of the 2002 season Riley & Scott had been dissolved by the bankruptcy of owners Reynard Motorsport and Riley Technologies had taken over care of the Mk III Cs. Two more chassis were now completed and Intersport Racing and Riley-backed Jim Matthews Racing joined the ranks of Dyson and Robinson. Dyson however chose not to continue using their Mk III C in 2002, opting instead to actually use the older Mk III once again. Dyson's choice to return to the older car did not however hinder their performance, as the team was winning races once again in the Rolex Series, earning four straight in the middle of the season. Dyson also campaigned their Mk III in the ALMS with a best finish of fourth, including at the 12 Hours of Sebring, but later chose to replace their ALMS Mk III with an MG-Lola EX257. Still running the Mk III in Rolex a final victory was earned before the close of the season. Chris Dyson fell two short of the Drivers Championship behind Didier Theys, but the Dyson Racing team beat out Theys' Doran Racing by two points to earn another Teams Championship. New regulations for the Rolex Sports Car Series were announced during 2002 which made the Mk III ineligible to compete from 2003 onwards, so Dyson Racing's victory at the Daytona finale marked the last win earned by the original Mk III design.
The Mk III C, although not victorious, did manage several podium finishes in both the Rolex Series and the ALMS during 2002. Robinson Racing twice finished in third place in Rolex, while Riley Racing succeeded in finishing in third place at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Riley & Scott also returned to Europe to enter their latest Mk III in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but the car was once again unable to endure after its engine failed 13 hours into the race.
Although development of the Mk III C ended in 2003 as Riley Technologies concentrated on their new Daytona Prototype, Mk III Cs continued to be used by a few teams attempting the American Le Mans Series. American Spirit Racing, using a Lincoln-badged V8, entered the full season and had their best finish of fifth at Laguna Seca. Intersport Racing and Jim Matthews Racing also entered select ALMS rounds, but they also competed in two different events in Le Mans. The Matthews car entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans but as in the previous year suffered engine failure, this time after 15 hours. Intersport however entered the 1000 km of Le Mans later that year, but retired with clutch failure after only an hour.
During the 2004 American Le Mans Series season, Mk III Cs ran only two races. Intersport Racing ran alongside newcomer Autocon Motorsports, with the latter finishing the 12 Hours of Sebring in seventh place. Autocon returned on their own at the end of the year, failing to finish the Petit Le Mans. Autocon's 2005 season actually featured more events for the Mk III C, but the team never finished better than seventh. The last race of the 2005 season, the Monterey Sports Car Championships at Laguna Seca, became the final race of the entire Mk III line.
Variants.
Rafanelli Mk III.
The Italian Team Rafanelli initially campaigned Mk IIIs in 1998 using BMW V8 powerplants in an attempt to prepare for BMW's launch of the V12 LM in 1999. After Rafanelli was replaced by Schnitzer Motorsport as BMW's supported team, Rafanelli purchased a Judd GV4 V10 for the second of their chassis, #014. Although Riley & Scott was developing their Series 2 upgrades for the Mk III at the time, Rafanelli's design team attempted to modify their own car to better suit the demands of the American Le Mans Series in which the team now planned to compete in 1999.
Nearly all modifications to the Mk III were aerodynamic in nature, concentrating on the nose and rear tail of the bodywork. The nose of the Rafanelli Mk III featured a subtle curve, blending into the horizontal splitter, rather than the static angle used on the standard car. The central air intake at the bottom of the nose was extended outwards, now positioned vertically rather than flush with the nose of the car. At the rear, the tail of the car was extended further than the standard bodywork, and a new design for the rear wing was implemented. The rear fender flares were also extended forward to create a longer transition in the shape of the bodywork.
Rafanelli's Mk III competed throughout the entire 1999 American Le Mans Series season, earning a victory at the Grand Prix of Atlanta. This became the only win scored by a Mk III in the American Le Mans Series. Team Rafanelli ended the season sixth in the Teams Championship before they decided to move on from their Mk III and purchase a Lola B2K/10 prototype the following year.
R & M SR01.
Italians Paolo Radici and Fabio Montani initially founded the Target 24 squad in 1996, campaigning one of the original Mk III chassis that same year. A Series 2 Mk III chassis was purchased by Montani in 1999 before the team was reorganized in 2000 and became R & M. The team campaigned the Mk III with a Judd GV4 V10 in the FIA Sportscar Championship and even won one race, but increasing competition from other teams as well as a lack of upgrades for the Mk III from Riley & Scott during the 2000 and 2001 seasons led team organizers to begin a project to build their own improved car based on the Mk III.
Started in the middle of the 2001 season, the SR01 project involved the creation of an all new carbon fiber monocoque to replace the Mk III's mixed steel tube frame and carbon chassis. Elements of the Mk III's construction were however retained so that parts could easily be moved from the Mk III to the SR01. The rear structure of the SR01 was also redesigned around the Judd GV4, while an R & M-designed differential replaced the standard unit. Some aerodynamic improvements were also made to the front bodywork.
R & M's SR01 competed during the entire 2002 FIA Sportscar Championship season, earning several third place finishes en route to a third place result in the Teams Championship. The SR01 did not compete again after the 2002 season.
Robinson Mk III C.
When the Mk III C debuted in 2001, Robinson Racing was amongst the first customers, purchasing chassis #001 and entering it in the Rolex Sports Car Series with a Judd powerplant. The car however did not compete until the season finale after an earlier testing accident. The team was however not satisfied with the Mk III C's performance, and during the off-season began modifications to the Mk III C's design. Automotive designer John Mills was hired by Robinson Racing to improve the aerodynamics of the team's car.
As part of Mills' design, the front end of the car was replaced with entirely new bodywork attempting to fulfill two problems. The front radiator was removed and the bodywork opened to allow two wide channels on either side of a shallow nose. These channels fed cooling air into the sides of the car, where new radiators were now located. This not only gave the car better speed in a straight line, but also improved the cooling capabilities of the radiators.
The rear end of the car also received design changes, most notably the relocation of the exhaust system. Instead of exiting out the back of the car, the exhaust was now ejected vertically from towers attached to the front of the rear wheel arches. Robinson Racing's Mk III C debuted at the 2002 24 Hours of Daytona, but did not finish due to gearbox problems. The car competed in three other events that season, twice earning a best finish of third. After 2002 the SRP class no longer competed in the Rolex Sports Car Series and Robinson's Mk III C was retired from competition. Robinson Racing's modified Mk III C is however still driven, now entered in several historic racing events. The car now runs a larger 5.0 litre Judd GV5 in place of the older GV4.

Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers football

The Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers football program represents Kentucky Wesleyan College in college football as members of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) at the NCAA Division II level.
The college's football program began in 1907, lasting until 1930, when it was discontinued due to financial reasons. In 1982, the decision was made to re-establish a football program at the school, with the school resuming football operations the following year. Initially, the Panthers were an NCAA Division III team, unaffiliated with any conference. They moved into Division II beginning with the 1994 football season.
History.
1907–1930.
Not much information is available regarding the Panthers teams of the early 20th century. The team played teams such as Kentucky, Marshall, and Xavier. According to the scant material available through Fanbase.com, they did not have much success during this period. Eventually, due to financial reasons, the football program was discontinued after the 1930 season.
Division III – 1983–1993.
1983–1989.
When the football program was re-established at Kentucky Wesleyan in 1983, the school played at the Division III level as an independent school, unaffiliated with any conference. That first season, they finished with a 3–5 record, and they followed that with another nine straight losing seasons before posting a 6–4 record in 1993. The Panther's first coach after the re-establishment of the program was Billy Mitchell, who compiled a record of 22–41–3 during his seven seasons.
1990–1993.
Mitchell was succeeded by Randy Awry, who had been the defensive coordinator for four years at another Division III school, St. Lawrence University. He posted four losing seasons, before posting the school's first winning season in 1993 at 6–4. In their first winning season in 1993, the team set records for passing completion percentage (55.7%) and defensive pass interceptions (21). On the defensive side that year, Troy Crissman led all NCAA Division III defenders with 9 interceptions.
Division II.
1994–2002.
In 1994 the Panthers moved to Division II level football and hired John Johnson, a former assistant coach with the Green Bay Packers. In his nine years as head coach, from 1994 to 2002, Johnson's overall record was 34–58. Those 34 wins are still the most by any Kentucky Wesleyan football coach. While he had a losing record during his tenure, the Panthers played NCAA Division I-AA teams 26 times, losing all 26 games. Johnson had two winning seasons as KWC's head football coach, 6–4 in 1997 and 7–4 in 1999. The 1999 KWC football team set the record with the most wins in a season with (7), finishing with a 7–4 record. The 1999 team started the season 5–0 (tying a school record) and rose to #1 in the NCAA Division II Non-Scholarship Poll by Don Hansen's "National Weekly Football Gazette" on October 17, 1999, finishing the season ranked #2. Don Hansen's Football Gazette named John Johnson the 1999 NCAA Division II Non-Scholarship National Coach of the Year and Linebacker Nick Boling (1997–2001) was named the 1999 NCAA Division II Non-Scholarship Linebacker of the Year.
The 2000 team finished 4–6, but finished 10th in NCAA Division II Football for total offense (434.4 yards per game). Wide receiver Corey Jordan (1997–2001) was named the 2000 NCAA Division II Non-Scholarship National Receiver of the Year by Don Hansen's "National Weekly Football Gazette". The 2001 and 2002 teams finished with a combined record of 2–19, but WR Corey Jordan, LB Vince Brodt,and LB Frank Wintrich, were named NCAA Division II Mid-Major 1st Team All-Americans by Don Hansen's "National Weekly Football Gazette" for 2001. Following the 2002 season, offensive lineman Jake Colson (1998–2002) was selected as a NCAA Division II Mid-Major 1st Team All-American by Don Hansen's "National Weekly Football Gazette". Following consecutive one-win seasons, John Johnson's tenure at Kentucky Wesleyan ended January 1, 2003.
2003–present.
Current head coach, Brent Holsclaw, a former Kentucky Wesleyan quarterback, was hired in January 2002. Through the 2013 football season, Holsclaw's overall record at Kentucky Wesleyan is 24–94. In Holsclaw's first season as KWC's head football coach, Holsclaw's 2003 Panthers finished 1–9. Unaffiliated to this point, the Panthers joined the NAIA's Mid-South Conference in 2004 and remained in the conference for 2005. In 2006 the Panthers returned to NCAA Division II, becoming a charter member of the Great Lakes Football Conference. The 2006 Panthers finished 0–11, the eleven losses were the most in school history.
Facilities.
From 1983 to 2003 the Kentucky Wesleyan Football team played their home games at Owensboro area high schools. In 2004, the Panthers began playing their home football games at Bullet Wilson Field, an on-campus field completed prior to the 2004 football season. The playing surface at Bullet Wilson Field features FieldTurf, an artificial playing surface. The stadium around the field underwent a major upgrade project following the 2006 season. When the upgrade was completed the home of the Panthers football team was to be known as Steele Stadium (Bullet Wilson Field).
Panthers in the Pros.
Three former Kentucky Wesleyan football players have played in the Arena Football League (AFL). Wide receiver Anthony Payton (1994–1996) played four seasons in the AFL for New Jersey Red Dogs (2000 and 2001), Buffalo Destroyers (2003), and Las Vegas Gladiators (2005). Defensive lineman Karl Bates (1997–1999) played seven seasons in the AFL for the Houston Thunderbears (2000 and 2001), New Jersey Gladiators (2002), Las Vegas Gladiators (2003), Detroit Fury (2004), Las Vegas Gladiators (2005), and San Jose SaberCats(2006). Wide receiver Sedrick Robinson (1993–1996) has played seven years in the AFL for the Houston Thunderbears (2001), New Jersey Gladiators (2002), Las Vegas Gladiators (2003), Columbus Destroyers (2004 and 2005), and Austin Wranglers (2006 and 2007).

Kyemon

Kyemon () (The Mirror) is a state-owned Burmese-language daily newspaper based in Yangon, Myanmar. Along with "Myanmar Alin", Kyemon is one of two Burmese language national newspapers in the country. "Kyemon" tends to carry more human interest stories whereas "Myanmar Alin" is more geared towards publishing government propaganda.
History.
"Kyemon" was founded in 1957 in Yangon by journalist U Thaung during Myanmar's brief experiment with parliamentary democracy and free media between 1948 and 1962. The daily was the best selling newspaper at that time, with a circulation of 90,000. After seizing power in March 1962, the military government of Gen. Ne Win cracked down on media, and nationalized all the daily newspapers, including Kyemon, in 1964. (U Thaung's open criticism of Gen. Ne Win earned him a prison sentence for him in 1964.)
The future poet laureate Soe Nyunt served as editor-in-chief of "Kyemon" from 1985 to 1990, going on to become Deputy Minister of Information from 1992 to 2003. 
Kyemon survived the military government's crackdowns on news media that left the country with only three national newspapers.
As of 2007, these papers, published by the News and Publishing Enterprise of the Ministry of Information, were the "Myanmar Alin" and "Kyemon" in Burmese and the "New Light of Myanmar" in English.
Content.
The front and back pages of all Burmese newspapers are almost all government related news and propaganda. At any rate, most Burmese read papers not for the news but for advertisements and announcements like weddings and obituaries. In 2006, the base rate for advertising was US$15 per inch per column and US$700 for a half-page advertisement.

William Lee Robinson

William Lee Robinson (born September 24, 1943) is a Democratic politician who was the mayor of Macon, Georgia from 1987–1991, and a four-term State Senator of Georgia. Lee Robinson is currently serving as the Circuit Public Defender of the Macon (Georgia) Judicial Circuit, which includes Bibb, Peach and Crawford Counties.
Background.
Born on September 24, 1943, in Rome, Georgia, Lee Robinson attended Bibb County Public Schools, and after graduation from Lanier High School, Robinson left temporarily for Atlanta and Georgia Tech.
He is the widower of Irene Scales Robinson [http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/macon/obituary.aspx?n=irene-scales-robinson&pid=147523657&fhid=4411]. The couple had two children, Christine Robinson Simmons, 42, and Jacquelyn Castellow, 29; and four grandchildren, AveryBeth Simmons, Will Simmons, Katherine Castellow, and Gunnar Castellow. He is a member of Ingleside Baptist Church, where Lee is an overseer, ordained deacon and active in international missions. Lee enjoys sailing, flying and running and completed the Walt Disney World Marathon in January 2004.
Lee Robinson is a licensed pilot (Commercial, Multiengine Land, Single Engine Land and Sea, Instrument) who holds the Gold Seal Designation to his Flight Instructor Certificate. The Federal Aviation Administration named him an Accident Prevention Counselor.
Career as a Circuit Public Defender.
In 2004 Lee Robinson was selected and is now serving as the Circuit Public Defender of the Macon Judicial Circuit, which includes Bibb, Peach and Crawford Counties. Robinson was presented the Justice Robert Benham Award for Community Service by the State Bar of Georgia and the Chief Justice’s Commission on Professionalism. Lee Robinson was the founding president of the Georgia Association of Circuit Public Defenders, an organization established to provide an independent voice of the Circuit Public Defenders to the public and the Georgia General Assembly. Lee has seventeen Assistant Public Defenders working on his team now, and anticipates eighteen Assistant Public Defenders when the office is fully staffed.
Robinson was selected as the inaugural president of the Georgia Association of Circuit Public Defenders at its organizational meeting on February 26, 2005. The association’s mission is to promote the interests of and issues that concern the various Circuit Public Defenders and Conflict Defenders throughout the State of Georgia. Among many accomplishments, Robinson’s tenure is perhaps most significant in that he was instrumental in ushering a “for cause” standard for removal of Circuit Public Defenders, thereby offering much needed protection from political and other pressures. Another important milestone during Robinson’s leadership was the selection of a Circuit Public Defender to serve as the Circuit Public Defenders’ representative on the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council. With no protocol in place, Robinson provided valuable guidance in designing the procedure for this selection that remains in place today. Robinson also championed development of a legislative committee to engage in advocacy with the legislature and advance the causes of Circuit Public Defenders before that body. Robinson’s importance to the development of the Georgia Association of Circuit Public Defenders can be seen by his continued presence on the Executive Committee by each succeeding president.
While working as a Circuit Public Defender, Lee was honored by the State Bar with the Eighth Annual Justice Robert Benham Awards for Community Service presentation on January 30, 2007.

Temple of Derr

The Temple of Derr or el-Derr is a "speos" or rock-cut Egyptian temple built by pharaoh Ramesses II in Lower Nubia. It is the only rock-cut temple in Nubia which was constructed by this pharaoh on the right (or east) bank of the Nile and used to stand at el-Derr. The temple's unique position "was probably because the river on its approach to the Korosko bend flows in an 'unnatural' southeasterly direction." The Derr structure was known in ancient times as 'The "Temple of Ri'amsese-meryamun" II "in the Domain of Re" ' and was dedicated to the god Ra-Horakhty. Scholars disagree over its precise construction date: the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal states that it was built in the thirteenth year of Ramesses II, presumably to coincide with his first royal jubilee. In contrast, John Baines and Jaromír Málek write that the temple of Derr "was built in the second half of the king's reign", likely because its "plan and decoration resembles the Great Temple of Abu Simbel (minus the colossal seated statues against the facade)." Abu Simbel was built between Year 24 and Year 31 of Ramesses' reign. According to Joyce Tyldesley, the Temple of Derr was built by Setau, who is known to have served as Ramesses' Viceroy of Kush or Nubia between Year 38 to 63 of this pharaoh's reign.
Decorations and architecture.
The temple of Derr is more elaborate than the "speos" of Beit el-Wali and "consisted of a sequence of two hypostyle halls (probably preceded by a forecourt and a pylon) leading to a triple sanctuary where a cult of statues of Ramesses II, Amon-Re, Ra-Horakhty and Ptah was celebrated." When cleaned and restored in modern times, Derr proved to contain unusually bright and vivid relief decorations which contrasted sharply "with the more subdued color tones" from other Egyptian temples. 
In 1964, the temple was dismantled and relocated, along with the Temple of Amada, to a new site. Early travellers visited the original site, and the temple itself was first studied and published by Aylward Blackman in 1913.

Fotos Politis

German educated Greek stage director Fotos Politis (Greek: Φώτος Πολίτης), 1890-1934, was one of the most prominent figures in the revival of the ancient Greek tragedies in the 20th century. A literary and theater reviewer and playwright, who was responsible for the creation of what came to be called “the theatrical tradition of the National Theater of Greece”, he developed original teaching methods for aspiring young actors in Athenian drama schools while the rehearsals for the plays that he staged were known for their long duration and exhaustive intensity. Politis felt an obligation to educate not only the actors, corrupted by the French "Théâtre de boulevard" of the time, but also the general public by bringing it in contact with the masterpieces of ancient Greek tragedy, Shakespeare, classical European theater and avant-garde theater.
Early years.
Born in Athens in an academic environment, Politis was the son of Nicolaos Politis, a professor at the University of Athens, who was considered the father of Greek folklore studies and cultural traditions, while his younger brother, Linos Politis, also a professor, taught modern Greek literature. In 1906-1908 he attended classes at the Athens Odeum’s (conservatoire) drama school and received the second prize in a drama competition with his play "The Vampire".
At the end of 1908, he left for four years to study law in Germany. During this time and parallel with his law studies, he took courses in philosophy, being deeply influenced by German idealism. He was also influenced by the ideas of the Austrian-Jewish director Max Reinhardt, who staged ancient Greek tragedies, which Politis followed closely, as well as most of the new ideas that disseminated from the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna, the most important German-language acting school. It was the time when the role of the director began to become as prevalent as that of the playwright and the protagonist.
In early 1913, Politis was drafted, because of the Balkan Wars and had to return to Greece to join the army.
Reviewer and critic in the 20s and 30s.
After returning from the front, he begins his first reviews with a byline in January 1915, in the daily "Nea Hellas" (New Greece), which was supporting Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos. Until his early death in 1934, he wrote 1103 reviews in various newspapers, like "Politeia" (The State), "Eleftheron Vema" (Free Tribune) and "Proia" (Morning).
Apart from his columns in the daily press, he collaborated from 1927 with Costis Bastias' newly published literary review "Ellinika Grammata" (Hellenic Letters). There he joined the closely knit ideological circle of the magazine, consisting of Costis Bastias (publisher), Yannis Apostolakis, Politis' older first cousin, mentor and later professor of literature at the University of Thessaloniki, Alexandros Delmouzos, prominent educator and proponent for the instruction of demotic Greek in the school system, K. Th. Demaras, Greece's foremost scholar on the Greek Enlightenment and later professor of Modern Greek Studies at the French university Paris I - Sorbonne Panthéon, and George N. Politis, Politis' elder brother and the magazine's top book reviewer. The circle supported the "demotic" (vernacular) language, Greek cultural traditions, German idealism, closely linked to the Enlightenment and was critical of rampant nationalism and communism.
Stage director, theatrical educator, translator.
In 1918, Politis participated in the founding of the "Hellenic Theater Co." by the Society of Greek Playwrights. The playwright Miltiades Lidorikis presided over the new company, with the poet Pavlos Nirvanas, the stage director Spyros Melas and Politis on the Board. Politis was further appointed professor with the Company's Drama school. He soon starts the translation in modern Greek iambic verse of Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" and chooses one of Greece's greatest actors, Aimilios Veakis, whose memorable performance as King Lear at the Royal (National) Theater of Greece in 1938 has remained indelibly written in the history of 20th century Greek theater, to appear in the homonymous role. Under the direction of Fotos Politis, "Oedipus Rex" opened in the old 19th century neoclassical theater "Olympia" on Academias Street. The performance became a milestone in the revival of ancient tragedy, with the ideas of Max Reinhardt often evident, in the interpretation of the play. Politis was acclaimed as a director, the tickets were sold out, while the prominent reviewer Marios Ploritis wrote of "The first face to face confrontation with the interpretation of ancient drama". The Greek stage director and historian of the theater Mitsos Lygizos observed about the contribution of the "Hellenic Theater Company" that:
In 1925, when the Greek Actors' Union decided to create the "Professional School of Drama", Politis was appointed professor of repertoire and acting and from 1927 he started staging performances. Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" (1927), Ibsen's "John Gabriel Borkman" (1928), the 17th century Cretan religious drama "Abraham's sacrifice" (1929), etc. He also tried his first open air performance of ancient tragedy, Euripides' "Hecuba" (1927), with Greece's famous actress Marika Kotopouli and her troupe, in the all marble Panathenaic Stadium, build in the 1890s for the first Olympic Games of modern times. The stage director Alexis Solomos described the performance, as the most renowned "Hecuba" of the interwar period.
At the National Theater (1930-1934).
Naming the National Theater (background).
There is some confusion as to the actual name of the National or Royal Theater and the various alternating forms this name took, following political changes. At the end of the 19th century, King George I of Greece founded the Royal Theater, with Ernst Ziller as architect, which began its performances in 1900. Its existence was short lived, since it closed in 1908. The property belonged to King George I and the Royal Family and it was rented out to various troupes. The 1922 republican revolution confiscated the building, tore down the royal insignia and continued to rent it. In 1930, by law, the Greek state founded a National Theater, with the intention of erecting a new building, but due to the depression, it was decided to temporarily use the old Royal Theater. When in 1935, the monarchy was reinstated and King George II returned to Greece, the National Theater was renamed Royal Theater, but was now a state owned theater. In fact, the State indemnified Royal Prince Nicholas, uncle of King George II, who had inherited the building. With the beginning of the German occupation in 1941, the theater was renamed National Theater. After the Liberation in 1944, the building itself was named Royal Theater, but the state theater company appearing continued to be officially called National Theater. The only thing to remember is that the National or Royal Theater founded in 1930, had no ideological connection, nor was it a continuation of the old Royal Theater of 1900-1908, but represented an entire new ideology expressed by Fotos Politis. The only thing in common were the walls, and that because of lack of money.
The founding of the National Theater.
When in January 1930, George Papandreou became minister of Education (1930-1932), in the cabinet of prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos (1928-1932), his dream was to found the National Theater of Greece, where the country's two leading actresses, Kyveli, to whom he was married, and Marika Kotopouli, along with leading actor Aimilios Veakis, would participate in collaboration with an important stage director like Spyros Melas. He immediately started working with the poet Ioannis Gryparis, who was Secretary of Letters and Arts in the ministry, since the 1922 revolution of republican officers, that had forced King Constantine I to abdicate. An ardent supported of a new state National Theater, Gryparis had been in the ministry for the past eight years, but for a short thirteen month period (June 1925 - July 1926) when he was removed by the Theodore Pangalos dictatorship. Already in 1923, he had told Fotos Politis that he had decided to go ahead with the creation of a National Theater, while in 1924, he gave an interview to Costis Bastias, where he describes with precision all the problems that had to be met for such an undertaking, like the building, financing through a tax on gambling and lotteries, the cast and the administration. Much of the ground work was already prepared and prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos had given his approval. The new law was published on May 5, 1930 and the first immediate appointments were Ioannis Gryparis, as director general, Costis Bastias, as secretary general and Fotos Politis as stage director.
Fotos Politis gains control of the Theater.
After Spyros Melas refused the position of prime stage director and Miltos Lydorikis was hired and resigned, Minister Papandreou accepted to elevate Fotos Politis to the position of prime stage director in the beginning of 1931. From there on, things started moving. The 15 member Board was replaced by a more active seven member body and the Executive Committee's members were reduced and its decisions became merely advisory. It was renamed as the Artistic Committee. By mid-November 1931, the Chairman of the Board, theater historian Nicolaos Laskaris, resigned, feeling bypassed by the small, hardcore decision making group of Politis, Gryparis, Bastias and poet Pavlos Nirvanas, a member of the Artistic Committee. Due to his continuous presence in the Athenian press as a journalist and columnist, Bastias replies to most of the attacks in the press against a theater that had yet to be inaugurated. When Petros Pikros, the ex editor-in-chief of the communist daily "Rizospastis" (The Radical) and managing editor of the Marxist review "Protoporoi" (The Vanguardists), attacks the theater, Bastias replies with two articles, "The National Theater and Marxist theory", saying:
In August 1931, just prior to the inauguration of the National Theater, Politis travels to Germany and Austria to be informed and brought up to date with the latest developments in Max Reinhardt's productions. Upon his return he continuous building the foundations of a new theatrical tradition and adding to the Greek theater, after the playwright and the actor, a new third factor —the director. Till then, leading first ladies like Kyveli or Marika Kotopouli ruled their troupes with an iron hand, making all the important decisions. Sometimes, a director would be used, but in a secondary capacity. But, Politis reduced the importance of the protagonists, creating harmonic and disciplined ensembles, far from the hastily prepared and improvised productions, having to train the cast in a new acting method. This demanded exhaustive teaching and rehearsals. Costis Bastias describes for us how demanding Politis was:
Politis first stage director of the National Theater.
On Saturday evening, March 19, 1932, the most important cultural event of the interwar period in Greece took place. The inaugural performance of the newly renovated National Theater with Aeschylus' tragedy "Agamemnon" and a one-act comedy by Gregorios Xenopoulos was a great success. Every last seat was sold out, as the Athenians arrived — the gentlemen in white or black tie and the ladies in long evening gowns.
For the next 32 months, until his premature passing away at daybreak of December 4, 1934, Fotos Politis staged 35 plays by the most prominent playwrights of all time. His repertoire included Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Shakespeare, Molière, Goldoni, Schiller, de Musset, Ibsen, Zweig, Shaw, O'Neill, as well as modern Greek playwrights like Demetrios Byzantios, Gregorios Xenopoulos, Pantelis Horn, Spyros Melas and Alecos Lydorikis. For Politis, this was his way to uplift an audience by bringing it in contact with the masterpieces of theatrical art from all over the world, from the ancient Greek tragic poets to the contemporary playwrights. Through his stage direction, he assisted his public to approach the essence of every play. The general secretary of the theater, Costis Bastias, who had closely followed Politis' staging methods, observed:
The novelist, playwright and columnist Angelos Terzakis, who played a major role in the development of the National (Royal) Theater since 1937, as general secretary, director of repertoire and director general in succession, remarked concerning Politis' preferences in the repertoire and staging, that he had certain specific beliefs:
The National Theater received innumerable attacks in the press because of its hostile attitude against the popular Théâtre de boulevard, its views toward the all-mighty leading actors and its repertorial selections, especially the limited number of contemporary Greek plays. In the beginning of October 1932, the Theater inaugurated its new season, its second season, with Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice". Bastias again wrote about Fotos Politis and the new season:
An epilogue to Fotos Politis' life and contribution.
Fotos Politis' contribution to the theater and literary criticism was indeed of significant consequence. He introduced a theatrical standard, when he first entered the world of the theater, much more demanding than what was currently in use. He fought against hastily prepared productions that were then prevalent, the miserable repertoire based on the "french boulevard", and the authoritative ways of the leading actors-managers, who in no way wanted to collaborate with the new and upcoming stage directors. He supported the struggle for the Demotic Greek language to prevail, the strict adherence to the texts without unwarranted alterations, the European avant-garde movements in the theater, which he knew quite well, and the stage director's predominance, as the foremost head of the artistic creation, who interprets the playwright, and with his baguette conducts the actors, set designers, costume designers, musicians, choreographers, to bring about the desired result. As University of Athens professor of theatrical studies Katerina Arvaniti has written:
The establishment of a theatrical tradition is not a simple matter, especially one that has to do with the founding of a venerable institution like Greece's "National Theater". Usually, many decades, if not centuries like the Comèdie Française, are required. Politis' persistence for hundreds of exhaustive rehearsals now becomes clear. The singular teaching of elocution in the manner required by Greek tragedy, the rhythm of the performances, the movement and gestures of the ancient chorus and the performers with detailed sketches by Politis of their every stance, as seen in his prompt books (Regiebuch), something that Reinhardt did in great detail. But also meticulous directions to the actors for the sounds of the performance (cries, footsteps, banging), that combined with the music created an acoustic whole, the directions to set designer Kleovoulos Klonis expressing the spirit of the production, something that Klonis, familiar with the European avant-garde, would interpret with his expressionistic, bulky, architectural cubes and his Jessner stairs, and to modern painters like Spyros Papaloukas and Fotis Kontoglou who worked on the sets, as well as directions for lighting and special effects. All these together create the complicated puzzle, which today gives us the opportunity to better understand the great stage director Fotos Politis' wonderful productions.
The theatrical tradition that Fotos Politis created at Greece's National Theater, was continued after his death in 1934 by Costis Bastias and director Dimitris Rondiris. The following year, Bastias became director of repertoire, a new institution for that time, and wrote a 68 page report setting down both the theoretical principles of a National Theater and the specific plays that should be staged from the ancient theater, Elizabethan theater, classical theater, contemporary theater and avant-garde theater, with a critical analysis of each. Theater reviewer Costas Georgousopoulos, who also teaches at the Department of Theater Studies at the University of Athens and discovered the report in 1991, wrote:
On the other hand, Dimitris Rondiris, who had studied at the Reinhardt Seminar and had worked as an assistant to Max Reinhardt at the Salzburg Festival, when Reinhardt was director of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, had been recalled to Athens by the Board of the National Theater to become assistant director to Fotos Politis. After Politis' death, he succeeded him as prime stage director of the National Theater, and after World War II became its director general. Rondiris, with Bastias, continued the tradition of the National Theater, enriched it and added their theory that the tragedies of the ancient Greek poets are staged only in the open air theaters of antiquity, for which they were written, and not in the closed Renaissance theaters. This is a view that had not been adopted by Fotos Politis.
From 1935 to April 1941, when the Axis Powers occupied Greece, the tradition, as well as the fame, of the National Theater grew by leaps and bounds, with Bastias becoming director general (1937), and the passing of a new law that gave him the authority to act more or less independently, despite the existence of a dictatorship, and Rondiris, perfecting his exhaustive teaching methods and his unique staging inspiration. The National Theater became a huge organization with its actors, directors, set and costume designers, musicians, dancers and a whole operatic company that was added and began its performances in 1940, The National Opera of Greece. The major emphasis of Bastias and Rondiris was the revival of ancient Greek tragedy with performances throughout Greece and abroad. One of the most renowned was the first performance of ancient tragedy since antiquity at the theater of Epidaurus with the "Electra" of Sophocles in 1938.
At first, the Theater traveled to other Greek cities, like Patras and Thessaloniki. Then Greek architect Constantine Doxiadis designed a traveling theater with trucks and buses that could be set up anywhere and covered the whole country. It was named Arma Thespidos (The Chariot of Thespis). In 1939, the main company of the National (Royal) Theater traveled abroad for the first time. It began with Alexandria and Cairo in the spring and after returning to Athens left again in June and July to perform Sophocles' the "Electra" and Shakespeare's "Hamlet", at Oxford, Cambridge, London, Frankfurt and Berlin carefully balancing the two sides which by the end of that summer would be at war.
The Theater's "Grand Tour", as it came to be called among theatrical circles, was a great success both in the U.K. and in Germany and was rated as equal to the Comédie-Française and the Moscow Art Theater. Concerning Dimitri Rondiris' stage direction the reviewers wrote that he surpassed the wildest dreams of his teacher Max Reinhardt, while Richard Prentis noted:
The "News Chronicle's" Henry Bean wrote: "Hamlet in modern Greek —a new way of doing Shakespeare to end all new ways" and commented about the "Electra" that: "It takes many years in perfecting the difficult technique of the spoken chorus". And W. A. Darlington noted in the "Daily Telegraph": "The most impressive performance of the "Electra" that I have seen". But in the end, after the performance of the "Electra" at His Majesty's Theatre, the venerable "The Times" of London wrote:
Post mortem recognition of Fotos Politis, as well as his successors and students.

Intellectual property law in Senegal

Enforcement and attitudes.
As in most developing countries, intellectual property protection in Senegal is weak. Copyright infringement is not regarded as a crime, and it is widely accepted by consumers. Senegal’s criminal law provisions do not provide for criminal procedures in case of trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. In addition, because of budget constraints, Senegal’s Copyright Office has had difficulty enforcing sanctions against individuals who infringe copyrights in the course of business, including hackers and distributors of infringed copies. Nonetheless, the Copyright Office has begun vigorous attempts against counterfeit media, seizing items as well as putting stickers on legal merchandise. It is currently continuing these enforcement efforts. Microsoft began an anti-piracy campaign in Senegal in early 2004 and reports some success in converting users of pirated Microsoft products through the sale of deeply discounted Microsoft licenses.
Treaties and law.
Senegal is a signatory to the Berne Convention. It also is a member of the African Organization of Intellectual Property (OAPI), a grouping of 15 Francophone African countries, which has established among its member states a common system for obtaining and maintaining protection for patents, trademarks and industrial designs. Therefore, rights registered in one member country are valid in all. Patent validity is 20 years. Registered trademarks are protected for 20 years at each registration, renewable without limit.
Senegal is a signatory to the World Trade Organization and its Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS). Since January 2000, Senegal theoretically has been in full compliance with the TRIPS accord, but has yet to deposit its instruments of ratification for WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms.

Circular coloring

In graph theory, circular coloring may be viewed as a refinement of usual graph coloring. The "circular chromatic number" of a graph formula_1, denoted formula_2 can be given by any of the following definitions, all of which are equivalent (for finite graphs).
It is relatively easy to see that formula_16 (especially using 1. or 2.), but in fact formula_17. It is in this sense that we view circular chromatic number as a refinement of the usual chromatic number.

Strawberry Fields (2006 film)

Strawberry Fields is a 2006 documentary film by Israeli filmmaker Ayelet Heller about the hardships faced by Palestinian strawberry farmers in Gaza, who find their livelihood disrupted by the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Plot.
"Strawberry Fields" points out that strawberries grown in Gaza are the only agricultural product marketed internationally as being of Palestinian origin. One of the major Gaza strawberry farms in located at Beit Lahiya. More than 1,500 tons of strawberries are exported from Gaza to Europe through the Israeli company Agrexco. In order to get overseas, however, the fruits need to pass through the checkpoint that separates Israel and Gaza. The 2005–2006 growing season coincided with the Israel's disengagement from Gaza and the rise of Hamas as the ruling political entity. The armed conflict between Israel and Hamas resulted in the closing of the border checkpoint. The strawberries grown at Beit Lahiya cannot leave Gaza, resulting in significant losses for the farmers and their Agrexco partners. Unable to transport their produce, the farmers have no choice but to dispose of their crop and prepare for the following year’s growing season.
Production.
Ayelet Heller stated she wanted "Strawberry Fields" to be seen as a documentary that covers the human aspect of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, rather than the political elements. "I wanted to do a film about strawberries and hope, relationships between Israelis and Palestinians," she said in an interview with Agence France Presse, adding that many Israeli had serious misperceptions about Gaza. "For them, Gaza is the most dangerous place of the planet. But in the film, I am accepted by people who are nice, who tell jokes."
Heller also stated that she did not tell her family and friends she was working in Gaza, in order to save them from worrying about her safety and security.
"Strawberry Fields" was shot between June 2005 and March 2006, the strawberry growing season at Beit Lahiya. Throughout production, gunshots could be heard in the near distance while filming was underway. At one point, Heller's crew telephoned the Israeli Air Force to ask not to be bombed because they were shooting the film.
Release.
"Strawberry Fields" had its premiere on Israeli television and played in film festivals in Europe and North America. Sean Farnel, director of programing for the Hot Docs Film Festival in Toronto, praised the film for providing a different approach of examination for the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In the U.S., "Strawberry Fields" was released in non-theatrical DVD distribution by Cinema Guild Inc.

ZIL-117

The ZIL-117 is a luxury sedan (sometimes referred to as a limousine because of its size) built by ZiL in Russia first presented at the Autopron (precursor of the Moscow International Motor Show) in 1977. The car was reported to be only long, compared to for the established ZIL-114
The ZIL-117 shares the 6.9 litre V8 engine by now fitted also to the earlier long-wheelbase ZIL-114. Maximum power output of at 4,400 rpm was claimed, using a relatively high 9.0:1 compression ratio, fuel feed being via a single four-choke carburettor. The car uses a three-speed automatic transmission and power steering came as standard. The factory claimed a maximum speed of between 118 and 125 mph (190 and 201 km/h).
The 117 and the 114 represented a break from the over-decorated and ornate styles of previous ZIL models, and both cars had uncluttered, modern lines. In some respects the 117 also resembled the Chrysler Imperial of the mid-1960s. Another car of similar design that was based on the ZIL was the Hongqi (Red Flag) automobile of that time.
One of the reasons to design the ZIL-117 was a need of a government car of an intermediate rank between ZIL-114 (reserved for highest state and party authorities) and GAZ-13 Chaika, appropriate for example for Politburo member candidates, and also as supporting cars in highest officials' convoys.
Model cars.
Although made in limited numbers, the car has proven popular for die-cast model makers. The first and most detailed was a 1:43 version released by Radon (Russia), a company which produced a wide range of Soviet-era vehicles ("left"). This heavy model was available in black or grey (the colour of army parade versions) with 12 moving parts, and featured opening doors and boot (with spare wheel), opening bonnet and detailed chromed engine, chrome metal trim and grill, rubber tyres and suspension, and perspex lights. Some examples had a metal aerial. Convertibles were also available in 2- or 4-door variants. Radon's post-Soviet successor Agat/Tantal released a white wedding version as well as the black, but quality can be poor compared to Soviet-era examples. In 2011 IXO/De Agostini released a black 117 with magazine detailing the car's history (having earlier produced a black ZIL-114). In line with other IXO models the body is basic with no opening panels, engine or suspension, and the exterior has painted trim/tail lights. Another version of this model was released as part of a series featuring cars from James Bond films (in this case "Casino Royale") and included a magazine.

Laureano Sanabria Ruiz

Laureano Sanabria Ruiz (born 22 March 1985 in Madrid), aka Laure, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Deportivo de La Coruña mainly as a right defender.
Club career.
Laure was a Real Madrid youth graduate whom, despite an impressive season for its C-team, did not see Ramón Calderón's board offer him a new contract. He then signed for CD Leganés, also in the Spanish capital and playing in the third division, where he was a regular during his only season.
After moving to Deportivo de La Coruña during the 2007 summer, Laure quickly went on to establish himself as starter in its reserve team, eventually catching the eye of main side's manager, Miguel Ángel Lotina, who picked him to replace injured Manuel Pablo against Villarreal CF on 13 January 2008, and he played the entire match in a 3–4 La Liga away loss. At the season's end, he earned a new deal to stay at the club until 2011.
In the 2009–10 campaign Laure appeared in 20 matches, mostly as a left-back, due to Filipe Luís' terrible ankle injury: Deportivo stood fourth in the table at the moment (January 2010), eventually finishing in tenth position.

Nora Kimball

Nora Koito Kimball-Mentzos or simply Nora Kimball is a ballet teacher and former American ballerina, who is often overlooked for being one of the first African American female soloists – if not the first – at American Ballet Theatre (ABT). She danced with the ABT in the mid 1980s and as an African American who is also Asian American, preceded Misty Copeland, who is often credited as the first. ABT has been described as one of the three great American-style classical ballet companies on the world stage today (along with New York City Ballet and San Francisco Ballet).
Kimball trained in New York City at the National Academy of Ballet before attending The Harkness House for Ballet Arts. Studied further at The American Ballet Theater School. Kimball has been a soloist with the Nederlands Dans Theater and the Frankfurt Ballet. She has also worked with Eliot Feld Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballett, Karole Armitage and Peter Sellars. She had moved to the Frankfurt Ballet by 1991. She has worked with William Forsythe. She continues to work in Frankfurt teaching for the Zena Rommett Floor Barre Technique TM since 2001 and the Dancedepartment of the Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst.
Notable performances.
At ABT Clark Tippet made his first ballet, "Enough Said", on Kimball, the rest of the cast being Robert Hill, Gabrielle Brown, Lucette Katerndahl, Kathleen Moore, Ethan Brown, John Gardner and Ross Yearsley.
Kimball starred in Peter Sellars' revival of "The Seven Deadly Sins" with music and lyrics by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht in their final operatic collaboration (the original choreography by Balanchine goes uncredited here.) Kent Nagano conducts the orchestra of the Opéra National de Lyon for this performance. Of the twelve scenes on the DVD, the first nine of which are choreographed, Kimball is credited on four.
Although the production was filmed in 1993, the 47 minute work was not released until June 10, 2003, and intercuts footage from performances in Memphis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and San Francisco. Sellars' direction is widely criticized.
She was one of three solo dancers in El Niño, an opera-oratorio by the American composer John Adams, during its premiers in December 2000 in Paris and January 2001 in San Francisco. Both premiers were under the stage direction of Peter Sellars and musical direction of Kent Nagano.
Kimball also appeared in David Gordon's 1987 production, "Made in U.S.A.", which starred Mikhail Baryshnikov. The show included three ballets entitled "Valda and Misha", "TV Nine Lives", and "Murder"; "Valda and Misha" was commissioned for the telecast.

University of Mindanao

The University of Mindanao is the largest private, non-sectarian university in Mindanao located in Davao City on the Southern Philippine island. Established in 1946, the University of Mindanao has ten branches spread over thirteen campuses in Southern Mindanao. It is currently an Autonomous Status per CEB Resolution No. 076-2009 with Category A (t) per CMO No. s. 2009 standing accredited by Commission on Higher Education (CHED). Its Business Administration and Information Technology programs were Centers of Development(COD) and its Teacher Education program was considered as a Center of Excellence(COE) by CHED. It is the largest private university in Mindanao and one of the first top five (5) schools with a highest number of programs accredited by PACUCOA in the country today.
History.
In the midst of rebuilding the ruins of World War II, Atty. Guillermo E. Torres constructed the institution that would provide the education for socially, morally, economically knowledgeable, productive and responsible citizenry of the country. His undying faith and enthusiasm pushed him to convince his friends in Manila and new acquaintances to fulfill this vision.
The realization of the dream marked history when the Mindanao Colleges was incorporated on July 27, 1946. During the first year of operation, classes were held in four rented rooms of the Borgaily Building along San Pedro Street in Davao City. Thirteen teachers were hired and there were 381 enrolees. Dr. Efigenia C. Occeña was the Acting Coordinator. The permitted courses were originally the six year complete Elementary Course, two-year
Secondary Course (1st and 2nd years), two year Elementary Teacher Certificate, two-year Associate in Commercial Science, and two-year Associate in Arts. To accommodate the increasing number of Enrolees, the Board of Trustees decided to buy Club Royale along Legaspi Street and renovated to suit classroom requirements. New parcels of land were purchased along Bolton and Bonifacio Street which is the present location of the main campus and Embassy Area respectively. The University’s influence erected more with the establishment of the Mindanao Collegian, the first free campus paper in Mindanao. It became the training grounds of the Davao News paper men, a lot of them front liner’s of the city’s local publications up to this date. The student-editors from the early days of the Mindanao Collegian are now the “who’s-who” in Mindanao’s media, government and business zeitgeist.
Foreign linkages were sparked when Atty. Torres left for the US for a sponsored study tour on May 1955. These bondages broaden the UM’s scope and help it gear up for more challenging global competitiveness. Some of them were the University on the Air (1971); Sister University agreements with the John Dewey International University Consortium of America, New York City and the Fongchia College of Engineering and Business of Taipei, Taiwan.
As its aim of providing “education for all,” UM became popular not only among middle classes but also to those poor but deserving young dreamers. The Open Education Program in the early 70s enabled the institution to help the poor but deserving college undergraduates employed in the business and factory sites and self-employed to earn a college education. From being a humble Mindanao Colleges in Bolton, it blossomed into the University of Mindanao on December 21, 1966 and has spawned 10 more branches to the outlying province in 1948 in Digos, Bangoy, Peñaplata, Tagum (1950), Guianga (1952), Ilang- Tibungco (1951), Panabo (1951), Bansalan (1962), Cotabato (1959), Toril and a sprawling learning ground in Matina. UM is the first non-sectarian university in Mindanao. The development of the Matina Campus with new infrastructure side by side with the improvement of the University’s image through accreditation with the PACUCOA was pursued with vigor by its founders and the UM family. As the revered historian Josefina C. San Pedro said it, “ As each fresh graduate faces the brave new world, equipped and ready, let it be always be remembered that this was how he (Guillermo E. Torres, Sr.) envisioned things to be.”
His vision of “education for all” is now well entrenched in the university that is continually responsive to the development of the country.
His dream lives on with each passing year, deeply rooted in the continuing history of the University of Mindanao as its graduates meet the challenges of the future.” Keeping the torch burning is something education never ceases to pass. Its embers serve as guiding light for those who desire to learn and improve the quality of life. From a one man’s vision, the hope of the nation and future of the young dreamers who come to UM’s halls lie.
The University President.
Dr. Guillermo P. Torres, Jr. finished his undergraduate degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration at De La Salle University, Manila. He took his Masters in Business Administration at Ohio University, USA. Finished his Doctorate at University of Mindanao.
Academic programs.
The University of Mindanao has more than 10 colleges and school located in three campuses. The Colleges of Business Administration, and Law and the Graduate School are located in Bolton Campus. The Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Nursing, Engineering, Architecture, Education, Forestry, Accountancy, and Criminology are located in Matina Campus. The Technical and Vocational Courses are located in Bangoy Campus. Each college is supervised by Dean and Program Heads/Instructor Coordinator.
Most of its academic programs are accredited by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) and the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP). Its Electrical Engineering is the first in the country granted Level III Reaccredited Status. Level III status is the highest accreditation granted by PACUCOA—a seal of excellence and quality in a given academic program. Its Architecture Program is the first in the country to be granted Level I Accreditation. UM is the first PACUCOA school in Mindanao granted Level III for various academic programs and one of the top five (5) schools in the Philippines with the most number of accreditation.
The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has granted Center of Development (COD) to its various academic programs, having the most number of CODs in Mindanao. These programs are Business Administration, Information Technology, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.
Scholarships, Media and Journalism.
Student Publication.
The official student publication of the university is Primum, Latin term for first. Its predecessor, the Mindanao Collegian, has been producing top-caliber editors, journalists and columnists in the entire region.
Broadcasting.
The University of Mindanao Broadcasting Network (UMBN) is a commercial broadcasting company in Visayas and Mindanao founded in 1949 in Davao City. It runs AM & FM Stations in Mindanao while its affiliate, Ditan Communications run the Visayas FM Stations.
In Davao City, its flagship stations are DXUM 819 kHz. in the AM band and DXWT Wild FM 92.3 MHz.

Sagchudak Island

Sagchudak Island (also spelled "Sagtchudakh") is a small island in the Andreanof Islands group in the Aleutian Islands of southwestern Alaska. The roughly rectangular island is approximately long and 0.6 mi (1 km) wide and lies about off the southern coast of Atka Island. The island's current name is nearly identical to the native Aleut name for the island and it entered navigational charts by the early 1850s. In the 1900s and 1910s, the island was one of many Aleutian islands stocked with foxes by the United States government for hunting and fur trading purposes. Although the foxes on uninhabited Sagchudak were not directly hunted, some were occasionally trapped and moved to and from the island to help ensure genetic stability in the various separated colonies.

Dracone Barge

A Dracone Barge is a large flexible watertight tube intended to carry a liquid cargo while towed mostly-submerged behind a ship. One large current example of the type has a capacity of 935 cubic metres (4.23m diameter, 91m long) while weighing only 6.5 tonnes empty.
The Dracone Barge was invented in 1956 by Professor William Hawthorne as a new type of oil tanker. The intent was to create an improved transport technology: the long tube can be pulled by a lower powered vessel than the equivalent tanker, the cargo can be handed off at the destination very quickly, and incurs no drag cost when empty (because it can easily be taken aboard), as compared to the similar unladen to laden drag of the rigid-hulled tanker of equivalent capacity.
The common modern use (described in a patent application filed by BP in 1972 in combination with capture booms) is in the clean-up of petroleum spills or pollution slicks, where any small and manouevrable vessel (e.g. a harbour tug) with pumping gear mounted on it can gather up a much larger volume of liquid than it can carry by pumping it promptly back over the side into a tanker or Dracone Barge. A secondary, but related use, is the offloading of bilgewater from large ships that must be treated (at a shore-side facility) and not dumped directly into the sea. 
The vessels were given the name "dracone" as it was "the nearest word in Greek for a mythical monster such as a sea serpent." However, one year earlier Frank Herbert wrote his first novel "The Dragon in the Sea" about submarines towing large bags to carry oil, and other sources say the naming was an "overt acknowledgment of the source of his idea". While being towed by a vessel, they display only one all round light placed at their stern so that it can be seen by other vessels and risk of collision can be avoided.
See also.
It should be noted that according to the USCG's 72Colregs, Dracones less than 25 meters (82.02') should display one all-round white light at each end. However, the "forward" light may be omitted. However, dracones of 25 meters or longer MUST display one all-round white at each end. Dracones exceeding 100 meters shall display additional all-round white lights between the fore and aft lights not to exceed 100 meters between these additional lights. While being towed by a vessel it displays only one all round light to avoid any collision.

Monk in Motian

Monk in Motian is the first album by Paul Motian to be released on the German JMT label. It was released in 1988 and features ten compositions by Thelonious Monk performed by Motian with Bill Frisell and Joe Lovano. Geri Allen and Dewey Redman make guest appearances. The album was reissued in 2002 on the Winter & Winter label.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4.5 stars stating "This is an utterly fascinating tribute to the music of Thelonious Monk. Most of the selections feature the unusual trio of tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano, guitarist Bill Frisell (who with his wide range of original sounds is really a one-band band), and drummer Paul Motian. Tenor saxophonist Dewey Redman and pianist Geri Allen are guests on two songs apiece and fit in quite well with the sparse but very complete trio. Among the ten Monk songs explored, taken apart and given surprising treatment are "Evidence," "Bye-Ya," "Ugly Beauty," and "Trinkle Tinkle." Recommended to open-eared listeners.".

Nathaniel A. Owings

Nathaniel Alexander Owings (February 5, 1903 - June 13, 1984) was an American architect, a founding partner of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), which became one of the largest architectural firms in the United States and the world. Owings viewed skyscrapers as his firm's specialty. His reputation rested on his ability to be what he called "the catalyst," the person in his firm who ironed out differences among clients, contractors and planning commissions.
Early years.
Owings was born in 1903 in Indianapolis, Indiana. His sister, Eloise, would become the wife of his business partner, Louis Skidmore.
In 1920, he traveled through Europe. The experience inspired him to begin to study architecture at the University of Illinois, but had to quit the school prematurely because of illness. He continued his education at Cornell University, earning a degree in 1927.
Owings first marriage to the former Emily Otis ended in divorce. He was survived by his second wife was Margaret Wentworth Owings.
Career.
Owings first job as an architect was with the New York firm of York and Sawyer.
As a young architect, Owings was impressed with Raymond Hood, who designed the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center. More than 50 years later, Owings described his first glimpse of the 70-story skyscraper as a breathtaking "knife edge, presenting its narrow dimension to Fifth Avenue."
Hood's recommendation led to a job Owings worked as an architect on the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago (1929–34). He had been hired by his brother-in-law, Louis Skidmore, the chief architect for the exposition. Together they designed the layout and buildings for the entire site. They were told to build pavilions for more than 500 exhibits at minimum cost using lightweight, mass-produced materials; and they devised solutions, using the simplest materials—pavilions built out of beaverboard.
After the exposition was over, the two men worked independently before forming a Chicago-based partnership in 1936 with a small office at 104 South Michigan Avenue. Some smaller projects remain from this period. An architecturally significant residence in Northfield, Illinois still looks and feels contemporary because of its open, inviting interiors and large windows. The partnership developed projects for corporate clients they had met during the Chicago exposition.
The firm opened a second office at 5 East 57th Street in New York in 1937; and young Gordon Bunshaft was hired by Skidmore. This satellite office focused initially on designing and developing a new office building for the American Radiator Company.
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM).
The two architects won the contract to design the 1939-40 New York World's Fair; and in 1939 engineer John O. Merrill joined the firm as partner. The name was changed to Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and the firm's operations were decentralized. Owings's initial responsibilities centered on the Chicago office. Skidmore worked in New York. Owings and Skidmore had learned the hard way that they just couldn't get along together. The partners' dysfunctional relationship could have doomed the firm, but SOM flourished, despite, or maybe because of, simmering distrust.
There were good business reasons for a practice with a foot in both New York and Chicago; and the firm found plenty of work in both cities. At the same time, it was seen as easier for the meticulous Skidmore to bear the aggressive and explosive Owings from a distance. John Merrill, a mild-mannered engineer, figured little in the volatile politics of SOM.
The firm would build a number of large projects, including government-funded work at military installations and air bases. During the war years, the partnership was hired to build a secret town for 75,000 residents in Oak Ridge, Tennessee where the atomic bomb was being developed.
Skidmore and Owings moved easily in the world of the Wasp business establishment. Owings became especially adept in encouraging corporate CEOs to award commissions to SOM. The partners didn't develop reputations as clever designers, but rather, they became known for their rainmaking skills and organizational acumen. They relied on others to do the creative work. SOM developed its reputation for reliability in large developments, and became one of the largest and most talked-about skyscraper builders in the 1950s. Owings described the SOM he helped to build as "the King Kong" of architectural firms.
Owings moved to San Francisco in 1951.
The firm helped to popularize the International style during the postwar period. SOM's best-known early work is Lever House (1952), which was designed by Gordon Bunshaft and reflects the influence of Mies Van der Rohe. Bunshaft's many strengths as a designer were enhanced with Owings as his SOM super-salesman; but personal antipathies between these partners produced a complicated relationship.
In 1954, SOM was awarded another major government-appointed project—creating a campus for the United States Air Force Academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado. SOM's concepts were not without detractors in Congress, in the Air Force leadership and elsewhere. As a senior SOM partner, Owings principal role in the project was to mediate differences between members of a Senate appropriations subcommittee and Air Force officers, some of whom had misgivings about what they thought were the firm's unacceptably modern designs.
Individual work.
Frank Lloyd Wright offered faint praise for a SOM project designed by Owings when he identified the J.C. Penny Building on the Circle in Indianapolis was "the one interesting building" in the city.
In the early years of the Kennedy administration, the plan to redesign Pennsylvania Avenue was the most significant redevelopment project in the country. Owings was a leading figure in the team which developed the preliminary design during more than a year of closely guarded, top-level work. He was chairman of the Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue (1964–1973), and he was named to the Permanent Commission as well. He advocated returning portions of the National Mall to pedestrian use and restricting further developmental growth in that region.
Owings and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then urban affairs adviser in President Richard Nixon's administration, were ultimately credited with the success of the master plan for the Washington Mall and for the redesign of Pennsylvania Avenue as the capital's grand ceremonial boulevard. Owings' indidrect influence continued after this planning phase was completed. His SOM protégé was David Childs, who was later appointed by President Gerald Ford as chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission.
As Chairman of the Board of Control for the Urban Design Concept team for the Interstate Highway System in Baltimore, he worked to restrict the development of a large highway through the city. He was a member of the Secretary of Interior's Advisory Board for National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments in Washington, D.C. (1967–1970), and later as Chairman of that Board (1970–1972). In this same period, he also served as Co-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Human Resources Council (1970). He was honored for his service on or contribution to the California Advisory Committee on a Master Plan for Scenic Highways, the Monterey coast master plan, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, and the President's Council on Pennsylvania.
Projects.
In his long career, Owings presided over more than $3-billion in construction projects, including:
Later years.
Big Sur.
With his wife Margaret Wentworth Owings, Nathaniel drafted the Big Sur Land Use Plan, a master plan to protect Big Sur’s scenic coastline. This work became the foundation for Big Sur’s eventual land-use policies; and this was a crucial step in Owings’s move towards his eventual role as environmental activist and spokesman.
Through the influence of Owings, in late 1957 his firm sent the architectural photographer Morley Baer to Europe to photograph SOM-built buildings. That resulted in Baer being able to stay on for a year and produce a set of striking photographs of pre-tourist southern Spain, especially of Andalucia.
Owings built the A-Frame "Wild Bird House" as a permanent home at Big Sur, California in 1958. In the early 1960s, he and his wife joined neighbors in organizing to limit commercial development along the "scenic highway" of California Route 1 which runs along the Pacific coastline. This small step into the world of political activism led to Owings further involvement in conservation and preservation campaigns. His memory is commemorated in the Nathaniel Owings Memorial Redwood Grove at Big Sur.
Santa Fe.
Owings' close personal ties to the Santa Fe area date back to 1944, when he and his first wife, Emily, came to live in Santa Fe. They built a house in Pojoaque, New Mexico where they raised their family of four children. He and his family continued to maintain their long-standing connection to the area community.
In later years, Owings kept a home near Nambé Pueblo, New Mexico; and in due course, he came to be known as an active preservationist in the Santa Fe region. One noteworthy success was in Las Trampas, New Mexico, where the 1760s San José de Gracia Church was saved from highway demolition by a coalition of villagers and Santa Fe citizens.
Owings died at age 81 in Santa Fe, New Mexico on June 13, 1984.

New York City Department of Sanitation Police

The New York City Department of Sanitation Police (colloquially, "Sanitation Police" or "San Cop") are NYS peace officer as per New York state criminal procedure law 210 and are the law enforcement arm of the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY). It primarily enforces the city's sanitation and recycling laws, but enforces all other laws and regulations as well including vehicle and criminal laws.
Overview.
Numbering approximately 130 officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, inspectors and chiefs, the DSNY Police force is made up of sanitation personnel who are specially chosen from a list of Department employed applicants to undertake specialized law enforcement duties. After undergoing sixteen weeks of intense specialized training, officers become New York State Peace Officers, they can carry a firearm with the approval of NYPD pistol license section, handcuffs, pepper spray, and batons, make arrests, issue summonses, use physical and deadly force, and undertake investigative responsibilities.
Once officers complete the four-month Sanitation Police Training Academy, they then undergo 400 hours of on the job field training as a Sanitation Police officer trainee with an experienced Sanitation Police officer before being issued assignments. Once they become full Sanitation Police officers, they continue yearly training to keep up with current laws and procedures and to requalify on all previous qualifications. The Sanitation Police force uses marked and unmarked dept cars.
Patrolling both in uniform and in plainclothes, Sanitation Police officers' responsibilities range from ticketing residents for mixing recyclable and non-recyclable trash to investigating the illegal dumping of garbage, commercial and toxic waste. In 1996, Sanitation Police officers assisted the NYPD with investigating the death of a sanitation worker who was killed when he was struck in the face by deadly hydrofluoric acid that was mixed with ordinary garbage. The suspect was arrested by Sanitation Police officers for unlawful disposal of a toxic substance.
On March 15, 1994 two NYC Sanitation Police Officers came to aid and were first on the scene to a call of officer shot. NYPD Police Officer Sean McDonald was shot and killed while attempting to arrest two suspects for the robbery of a clothing store. The suspects were arrested two days later by detectives.
Divisions.
There are many divisions of Sanitation Peace officers with each division handling different law enforcement functions:
Sanitation Police officers are also assigned to the New York City Business Integrity Commission and the New York City Office of Emergency Management.

Tommy Lahiff

Thomas 'Tommy' Lahiff (31 July 1910 - 8 December 1996) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon, South Melbourne and Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League (VFL) before becoming a successful coach and radio commentator.
Lahiff, a small rover who could play forward, started his career at Brighton before moving to Port Melbourne. He was recruited to Essendon in 1935 and kicked 32 goals in his debut season. In 1938 he returned to Port Melbourne and captain-coached them to the 1941 VFA premiership.
The VFA competition was suspended during the war so Lahiff had another spell in the VFL, joining South Melbourne. He had a memorable debut match for his new club when he kicked five goals, against Collingwood at Princes Park. His teammate Lindsay White, also making his debut with his second club, kicked seven. After just six games he crossed to Hawthorn mid season and in 1944 was appointed coach of the Hawks for the year but could only register two wins.
The rover finished up at Port Melbourne in 1945 and retired, having played 178 games from his VFA debut in 1930. He had won 'Best and fairests' in 1934 and 1940. In 2003 he was named as a forward pocket in Port Melbourne's official 'Team of the Century'.
He continued to coach in the 1960s, firstly at Port Melbourne in 1962 and then as caretaker coach of South Melbourne during the 1965 VFL season.
Lahiff also used to broadcast football games on radio. At 3KZ he teamed up again with Harry Beitzel to form a much–loved combination. “Are you there, Tommy?” Beitzel would ask, to which Lahiff would invariably reply from the dressing room: “Can you hear me, Harry?” First at 3KZ, then at 3AW, 3AK and finally 3WRB, their on air partnership lasted more than three decades.

Thomas Duffet

Thomas Duffet (fl. 1673 – 1676), or Duffett, was an Irish playwright and songwriter active in England in the 1670s. He is remembered for his popular songs and his burlesques of the serious plays of John Dryden, Thomas Shadwell, Elkanah Settle, and Sir William Davenant.
By profession, Duffet was a milliner; he maintained a shop in the New Exchange in London. Virtually nothing is known of his life apart from his surviving works. A Thomas Duffet confessed to forgery in 1677; this may have been the author. (Duffet's plays show a close familiarity with the lower and criminal classes of London society, perhaps suggesting first-hand knowledge.)
Plays.
Duffet's dramatic canon is uncertain and in dispute among scholars and critics. Six plays are generally attributed to him with a fair degree of certainty:
Duffet started out as a conventional dramatist; his earliest two works were comedies. The market steered him in a different direction. "The Spanish Rogue" has been called "the best of all this author's dramatic works, yet it met with very indifferent success." Upon publication, the play was dedicated to Nell Gwyn.
Duffet had much greater success in mocking other men's plays. Burlesque was a new development in English theatre in Duffet's generation; Sir William Davenant's "The Playhouse to Be Let" (1663; printed 1673) has been called the first burlesque in English drama. Duffett was the one author who took the greatest advantage of this new development in theatrical fashion, prior to Henry Fielding and other writers of the following century.
Like other practitioners of farce and burlesque, Duffet often responded quickly to developments in contemporary society. "The Tempest, or the Enchanted Island", Dryden and Davenant's 1667 adaptation of Shakespeare's "The Tempest", was first staged in Thomas Shadwell's "opera" version in 1674; Duffet's parody of it was on the stage before the end of the year. Duffet also parodied Settle's "The Empress of Morocco" (1673) and Shadwell's opera "Psyche" (1675).
As a dramatist, Duffet worked primarily for the King's Company; the plays he parodied were works staged by the rival Duke's Company. The King's Company was in major difficulty in the years after their grand venue, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, burned down in 1672. Duffet's burlesques show the King's Company determination to compete with their rivals despite this immediate disadvantage.
Subsequent generations of critics, who took their drama very seriously, did not look kindly upon Duffet's effusions. "As pearls before swine, so were Shakspere's plays in the eyes of the hog Duffet" — is one of many hostile comments in the relevant literature. Much of this reaction is a response to the abundant sexual humor in Duffet's work; modern critics with a greater tolerance for such material have taken a less harsh view of Duffet.
In contrast to most of Duffet's drama, "Beauty's Triumph" was a masque, staged, it title page attests, "by the Scholars of Mr. Jeffrey Banister and Mr. James Hart, at their new Boarding School for Young Ladies and Gentlewomen...at Chelsea."
Songs.
Duffet's songs have been compared to the songs of Henry Purcell and Thomas Arne in style. "Come All You Pale Lovers," "To Francelia," "The Mistake," "Uncertain Love," and "Since Cœlia's My Foe" are considered among his best. Duffet's collection "New Poems, Songs, Prologues and Epilogues" was published in 1676 by the bookseller Nicholas Wolfe. The title page of the collection states that the musical arrangements for the songs were "set by the most eminent musicians about the town."

Jaque de Cambrai

Jaque de Cambrai ("fl. c." 1260–80), sometimes Jacques, was a trouvère from Cambrai. He composed four "chansons courtoises", one "pastourelle", six devotional "chansons", and one Marian "rotrouenge". The Berne manuscript, in which most of his works are uniquely preserved, notes that his "Haute dame, com rose et lis" was modelled on (i.e. a contrafactum of) "Ausi com l'unicorne sui" by Theobald I of Navarre and "Mere, douce creature" on "Quant voi la glaie meure" by Raoul de Soissons. Otherwise none of his music survives, though staves for its transcription were prepared. Of all Jaque's works, only his "rotrouenge", the "Retrowange novelle", has no model mentioned in the manuscripts; its rubric reads only "Jaikes de Cambrai—De Notre Dame" (Jaque of Cambrai—On Our Lady). 
Jaque's devotional songs emphasise Jesus' humanity and his Passion. These may be directed at the Cathars, who denied Christ's humanity. Jaque was one of the last medieval French poets to express his devotion to Mary primarily through "chansons", that is, modelled on the "chansons courtoises" or love songs. After him the tendency was to use the "serventois" and even later the "chant royal".

Glenwood, Philadelphia

Glenwood is a neighborhood in North Philadelphia. It is located in the vicinity of North Philadelphia Station to West York Street.
In 1988 two residents of the 3100 block of Percy Street, Reverend Clarence Hester, a Baptist minister and activist, and Carrie Hartsfield, an insurance worker who retired, cofounded the Glenwood Community Development Corporation in an effort to improve the area. Hester defined Glenwood as the area bounded by York Street to the south, Germantown Avenue to the east, and Glenwood Avenue to the north and west. Glenwood is a low-income, predominately African American neighborhood. The area has one of the highest crime rates in the city.
Demographics.
As of the 2010 Census, Glenwood was 89% non-Hispanic black or African American, 6.8% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 2% white, 1% Asian, and 1.3% all other.
Crime.
The crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s changed the character of the neighborhood; it became considered to be on the western fringes of the Philadelphia Badlands. Hester said that when recreational drug presence appeared in his area, many residents left. Many houses became vacant and left to children, and many drug dealers moved into the area. Afterwards Hester began campaigning against drug dealers in the area. Hester persuaded W. Wilson Goode, then the Mayor of Philadelphia, to order the demolition of 82 properties, including former drug houses, at the intersection of Hutchinson Street and Percy Street. Frank Rubino of the "Philadelphia Weekly" stated in a 2007 article that Glenwood had "Crumbling, boarded-up" row houses with signs reading "KEEP OUT!," broken windows, lots with trash, porches with iron grating, graffiti, murals erected for people who died, discarded malt liquor bottles and tires, and stray cats. In the same article Hartsfield described Glenwood as "absolutely an ugly neighborhood," adding that "it's ugly and it’s dirty."

Mike Manning

Michael John Manning OBE (1943 – 22 August 2008) was an Australian-born Papua New Guinean anti-corruption activist and economist. Manning served as the second Chairman of Transparency International PNG (TIPNG), one of Papua New Guinea's largest organizations dedicated to eradicating corruption, from 2003 until 2008. He was a naturalized citizen of Papua New Guinea.
Early life.
Manning was born in 1943 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, but raised in Coonabarabran, New South Wales. He was the son of Margot Manning and Alan Manning, one of the founders of the Democratic Labor Party. 
Manning's father, Alan Manning, became a protégé and supporter of Ben Chifley and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) following his return from World War II. Alan Manning ran for office as an Australian Labor Party candidate three times, losing on each try. Manning's ALP affiliation did not sit well with others in rural Coonabarabran. The Manning family was eventually removed from their family farm by the ownership trust for "spending too much time in politics." Alan Manning and other ALP dissenters were expelled from the political party in 1956 after openly criticizing the "36 faceless men" of the ALP federal executive. In response to his expulsion, Alan Manning, a Protestant, joined the Democratic Labor Party, which was dominated by Catholics. Manning became the president of the Democratic Labor Party in New South Wales.
Manning contracted polio when he was just five years old. He spent one year inside an iron lung for treatment. He recovered from the disease. Manning went onto attend the The King's School, Parramatta thanks to a trust fund set up by his grandfather, who was a wealthy grazier.
Manning left his university studies for five years after the death of his mother, Margot Manning. He returned to farming at a town near Canberra before moving to Rylstone, where he helped to raise his younger brothers.
He returned to university and received his bachelor's degree in economics from Australian National University in Canberra. He then obtained a job with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics while he worked to obtain his master's degree in economics.
Career.
Papua New Guinea.
Before he completed his master's degree, Manning was recruited to work as an employee for the newly independent government of Papua New Guinea, which gained independence from Australia in 1975. He relocated to Papua New Guinea in 1975. Manning first worked for the Papuan government ministry in charge of minerals and energy. He then moved to the finance ministry, where he oversaw the finances of all nineteen provincial governments. Manning was known to be thorough in his oversight of provincial finances, even threatening to shut down provincial governments who deviated from official policy.
Manning worked in a number of other positions within the Papua New Guineanpublic and private sectors throughout his career. He worked for many PNG consultancies and board of directors throughout the country. Much of his work, lectures and economic studies centered on the expansion of smallholder production within the tree crops industry of the Papuan economy. The tree crop industry, such as cacao, is seen as a way to increase employment, living standards and prosperity for millions of Papua New Guineans who live in lowland and coastal villages, some far from major population centers.
Manning moved to Rabaul on the island of East New Britain in 1980 to run the community owned New Guinea Islands Produce Company -NGIP, which managed local cocoa plantations. He resided in Rabaul from 1980 until 1993. He met his wife, Relly, a local Tolai woman. Manning was inducted into Tolai society.
The cocoa industry in New Britain was severely hurt by the failure of the initial hybrid crop, which companies like NGIP invested in heavily, and then by the devastating Rabaul volcanic eruption of 1994, which also damaged parts of the town. The eruption led to the restructuring of the cocoa industry and Manning left the company, with later merged with Agmark Pacific.
Manning moved back to Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, following the volcanic eruptions. In 1997, Manning became the director of the PNG Institute of National Affairs, the country's leading independent economic agency and think tank. He served as director of the institute for eight years. Manning became a vocal critic of corruption and the decline of good governance within the PNG government, especially in Parliament. He was especially critical of the government of Prime Minister Michael Somare. He also became an ardent supporter of reforms undertaken by Sir Mekere Morauta when he was Prime Minister from 1999 until 2002.
In 2003, Manning authored a study for the Centre for Independent Studies, an Australian think tank. He suggested in the study that the government of Papua New Guinea was in danger of collapse due to corruption and lawlessness, similar to what had occurred in the neighboring Solomon Islands in the early 2000s. Manning's report also stated that PNG had lost control of large parts of its territory. PNG MPs, angered by bad press in the Australian media, called for Manning's deportation, some yelling "Put him (Mr Manning) on the plane tomorrow" during a parliamentary session. PNG Prime Minister Michael Somare called for Manning to pack up and leave the country.
Manning was referred to the PNG privileges committee for contempt by Prime Minister Michael Somare and Speaker Bill Skate as a prelude to Manning's deportation. Manning's referral was supported by a number of other Ministers and MPs, including Fisheries Minister Andrew Baing.
The referral led to a kangaroo court meant to silence Manning's criticism of the government. However, the referral failed when MPs were reminded that Manning, who had renounced his Australian citizenship, was a full PNG citizen, had married a PNG Tolai woman, had been inducted into Tolai society, and had raised three children in Papua New Guinea.
Transparency International PNG.
Manning's reputation as a well-respected anti-corruption campaigner led to his seat on the Transparency International PNG board of directors beginning in 1999. He was elected the Chairman of Transparency International PNG (TIPNG) in 2003 following the death of the organization's first chairman, Sir Anthony Siaguru.
Manning was a prominent critic of the improper use of public funds and government corruption. He advocated for the creation and improvement of a network of organizations within Papua New Guinea to fight corruption. Manning also served on the global accreditation board of Transparency International and was re-elected to that position at TI's 2007 meeting in Bali.
He once again came under fire from Prime Minister Michael Somare in December 2007 when he stated in a TIPNG anti-corruption seminar that two thirds of PNG's total annual revenue, equal to 2.5 billion PGK a year, was being stolen by corrupt politicians and government bureaucrats. Somare, who viewed Manning's statements as an attack on MPs, blasted him saying "Mr. Manning’s latest outburst in the media direct attack on the intelligence and commonsense of the people of Papua New Guinea who have mandated us to represent them in Parliament." Somare called on TIPNG and Manning to stop "hasty generalizations" and "stop playing power games under the guise of transparency." 
Manning was elected a full member of Transparency International's global governing board of directors on 19 August 2008, just three days before his death.
Semi-retirement.
Manning partially retired in 2006, but remained active with Transparency International and other organizations. Manning became chairman of Peace Foundation Melanesia, which works for local community conflict resolution within Melanesia. He also championed the recreation of the PNG Growers' Association, an agricultural pressure group.
He and his wife built a house in East New Britain in 2006.
Death.
Manning died of a sudden heart attack while walking near his home in Rabaul, East New Britain, on 22 August 2008. He was 65 years old. He was survived by his second wife, Relly Manning, and their children, David, Alan, and Belinda. He was also survived by his children from his first marriage in Australia - James, Kate, Samuel - and his grandchildren. His brothers, Chris and Ned, also survived him.
Manning's funeral, which was attended by hundreds of people, was held at an outdoor church in Port Moresby. Prominent dignitaries who attended included Governor General Paulias Matane, the Australian High Commissioner to PNG Chris Moraitis and the deputy leader of the opposition, Bart Philemon. Manning was buried in his wife's, Relly Manning, home village of Baai, which is located on New Britain near Rabaul.
Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea Michael Somare, who often clashed with Manning, said that "PNG has lost a son" and was "passionate about PNG" in a written statement. Somare further wrote that "While I have not always agreed with his views on issues, I respect his courage to speak his mind without fear or favour."
Transparency International PNG announced that Peter Aitsi had been chosen as Manning's interim successor as chairman on 9 September 2008.

Parts (book)

Parts is a children's book written and illustrated by Tedd Arnold. It was first published on September 1, 1997. Written in rhyme with cartoon-like watercolor illustrations, "Parts" is the first in Arnold's trilogy on the theme of body parts. It was followed by "More Parts" in 2001 and "Even More Parts" in 2004. In 1998, it won the "Tellable" Stories for Ages 4-7 Award (Storytelling World) and in 1999, the Colorado Children's Book Award. 
Plot summary of "Parts".
The story is aimed at 4-7 year-olds. It was inspired by a real life experience, when the author's young son, Walter, was disturbed by losing his first tooth. The protagonist of "Parts" is young Chip Block, who notices that his skin is peeling, some of his hairs remain on the comb, and his tooth is loose. His anxiety reaches its peak when a piece of mucus (which he assumes is a piece of his brain) falls out of his nose. Convinced that he is falling apart and will soon become toothless, skinless, brainless, and bald, the boy tries to hold himself together with his father's masking tape until he resembles a mummy. Finding him wrapped in the masking tape, his parents then explain to him about how parts of his body renew themselves.
Sequels.
"More Parts".
This sequel to "Parts" was first published in 2001. Like its predecessor, the story is aimed at 4-7 year olds, written in rhyme and illustrated by the author. Chip from "Parts" now becomes frightened by his literal interpretation of the idomatic expressions involving body parts that he hears adults using. Imagining that these expressions could lead to his body falling apart (his central preoccupation in "Parts"), Chip invents various kinds of protection for himself. For example, when his father asks him "to give a hand", he glues gloves to his hands to keep them from coming off his arms. Other expressions covered in the story include: 
"Even More Parts".
This final book in Arnold's trilogy was published in 2004, and is again illustrated by him. Unlike its two predecessors, "Even More Parts" is not, strictly speaking, a narrative and is not written in rhyme. Aimed at children 4-8, it is an introduction to the use of idioms or figures of speech in language, and more specifically to the use of idioms involving body parts. The protagonist is Chip from the first two books of the series, his name is revealed as – "Chip". Chip has compiled a list of all the worrying and mystifying things he has heard from adults, and makes himself a suit of armour to protect him while he is at school. The remainder of the book is an illustrated list of the sayings that have puzzled him. For example, one page shows the students in a classroom throwing their eyeballs at the teacher when she says, ""I want all eyes on me."" The illustrations often feature minor characters from the previous books – Chip's toy super hero, dinosaur and tank.

Poplar, Philadelphia

Poplar is a neighborhood in North Philadelphia. It is located north of Callowhill, between Spring Garden/Fairmount and Northern Liberties, bound roughly by Girard Avenue to the north, North Broad Street to the West, Spring Garden Street to the south, and 5th Street to the east. The neighborhood is mostly residential with commercial frontage on Broad Street and Girard Avenue and some industrial facilities to the west of the railroad tracks along Percy St. and 9th St.
Housing.
Originally, the neighborhood was composed mostly of single-family row houses and some industry. The Depression left many homes in disrepair, leading the city to raze them in the late 1930s to build the Richard Allen Homes, a massive public housing project that replaced blighted areas as well as provided housing for new workers attracted to the city for wartime production. The Richard Allen Homes remained Poplar's defining physical characteristic for the next several decades. Budget cuts by the city effected an egregious degree of deterioration in the homes, and poorly planned open spaces encouraged crime, generating notoriety as a center for crime and drug trafficking by the 1970s and 1980s.
The Allen Homes complemented Cambridge Plaza, a modernist public housing project comprising two 248-unit, high-rise towers and 124 low-rise townhouses. Cambridge Plaza was constructed in 1957 and demolished in 2001, when the Philadelphia Housing Authority began to erect suburban-style duplexes and single-family homes.
In the past ten years the homes were cleared out and replaced with suburban-style single-family homes and duplexes, and other public and senior housing exists on Fairmount Avenue, 8th St., 13th St., etc. Some original row houses remain, mostly south of Fairmount Avenue and west of the SEPTA line.
The Friends Housing Cooperative (FHC)is a residential housing complex which exists on one square block between Fairmount Avenue, Franklin Street, Brown Street and North 8th Street. FHC consists of semi-detached homes built circa 1850 and reconfigured into market-rate, gated apartment community in the early 1950s. After years of neglect and deterioration, this community has experienced a notable renaissance.
Landmarks.
While most of Poplar's original housing has been demolished, a handful of defining structures identify the neighborhood and can be seen from various points both in the neighborhood and around the city. The ornate, Victorian Divine Lorraine Hotel fronts on North Broad Street at its intersection with Fairmount Street; the massive, former Strawbridge & Clothier warehouse is located at 9th and Poplar Streets adjacent to the SEPTA elevated line (with the expanded building occupying almost the entire space between Poplar and Girard), and two 1920s-1930s public school buildings (Spring Garden School No. 1 and Spring Garden School No. 2) constructed in a Moderne/Art Deco style, designed by noted Philadelphia school architect Irwin Catharine, are located on 12th St. With the exception of the southernmost of the two schools, which remains in use, the rest of the older landmarks remain vacant. The Divine Lorraine Hotel and the two schools are listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with the Thaddeus Stevens School of Observation, Rodeph Shalom Synagogue, and Mary Channing Wister School.
The Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is at 830 North Franklin Street. It was built in 1966 and designed by Julian K. Jastremsky.

__NOTOC__
The LFG V 13 Strela (named for the Strelasund off Rügen) was a seaplane airliner produced in small quantities in Germany in the early 1920s. It was a conventional, three-bay biplane with an enclosed cabin for four passengers. The original design featured twin pontoons, but a landplane version was developed as the V 130. 
The V 13s were operated by Luft-Fahrzeug on its Hamburg-Stettin-Danzing and Stettin-Swinemünde-Stralsund routes. These services were later shared by V 13s operated by Luftverkehr Pommern and later were absorbed into Deutsche Luft Hansa. In Norway, Norske Luftruter operated two second-hand V 13s until the late 1920s.

Crescentville, Philadelphia

Crescentville is a neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia. It is located in the vicinity of Adams, Rising Sun, and Tabor Avenues.
Crescentville is referred to as the area bound by Tookany Creek to the South and West of Adams Avenue, up to the intersection of Comly and Rising Sun Avenues and to Whitaker Avenue to the East. Originally, the center of the "town" was located on the West side of Tookany/Tacony Creek, where Asylum Road (Adams Ave) crosses the creek. The Zip Code is 19120 (Olney Postal Station). Its history dates back before the Civil War as an affluent area once home to many mansions and estates, as well as a few farms. Most notably, during the Civil War, the area was referred to as "Grubbtown". Some of the Lower portions of Crescentville are sub-categorized and considered the Whitaker Mills area in reference to the Whitaker Mills that stood along Tacony/Tookany Creek at Tabor Road.
The name Crescentville is thought to be derived from the Crescentville Rope Factory that once stood along the Tookany Creek watershed.

The area East of Rising Sun, over to Tabor Road, is strictly all row homes. Some are built on land formerly housing a swampy area that was more of a nature area for the farming residents of prior days.
It was said that this area had boardwalks and picnic areas for the affluent residents, and even a small one-lane airport was to have been located nearer to present day Comly Street. Ben Franklin Public Elementary School was built at Rising Sun and Cheltenham in the 1920s and shared its principal at first with the nearby Lawndale Elementary School about a mile away, at Bingham and Hellerman Streets in Lawndale. On Tabor Road is Creighton Elementary School, also public, built in the 1900s. Both schools see a combined enrollment of just under 2000 students.
Row Homes.
The area was largely undeveloped until the 1920s when northward expansion of the city limits took hold and "modern" row housing was built over former farm land. Various developers built blocks and blocks of row homes with little thought or attention to open space. This effect would later have a downfall. The average price of a new row home back then was under $5,000.00—an equivalent to around $64,000.00 in 2008 dollars.
West side of Rising Sun Avenue.
The West side of Rising Sun Avenue is home to more single and twin homes, though a few blocks of classy stone Rows are found. Within one of those blocks of Stone Rows was the home of cartoonist Bil Keane, creator of Family Circus. William Keane attended and graduated from nearby St. William Catholic School and later attended North Catholic High School where he began and honed his drawing skills.
Lower end.
The lower end of Crescentville was home to many industries up until the late 1970s, early 1980s who employed many of the local residents. Included in this mix were Bond Bread, Exide Battery, 3M, Goodman Mills and several smaller mills. Later, Exide was demolished to make way for Rising Sun Plaza, a shopping center home to over two dozen stores. When it opened, Clover and Acme Markets were the bookend stores that were the primary draw, but after the closing of Clover and later the Acme Market, the draw has turned to more of the discount stores like National Wholesale Liquidators and an Asian Market, HK International, has taken over the former Acme store. There are still a few stores located within that are original stores when the Plaza Opened.
Churches.
Crescentville is also home to many small Protestant churches. Crescentville United Methodist is the oldest of these, located on Sentner Street, it was originally founded in 1920 just as the neighborhood was taking shape. Also located here is the Crescentville Baptist Church which started out in the 1930s in the basement of the old bank building on the Northeast corner of Rising Sun And Cheltenham Avenues, later moving to a Carriage house of the Former Tansey Estate and finally to its present location on Godfrey Avenue.
Crescentville has two Catholic Churches serving the neighborhood; St. William's Parish serves the larger majority of the community, while St. Ambrose Parish serves a portion of the lower end below Godfrey Avenue/Allengrove Street. Combined Parish Population is over 9,000. While St William School is still open and entering its 86th year, St. Ambrose School closed in 2006 and their students now attend St. Martin of Tours Parish School in Oxford Circle.
Just north of Comly Street is the location of the former Wentz Farm Reservoir. This reservoir was used by the City of Philadelphia until the late 1930s when it was dismantled and the land given over to the Recreation Dept. It was built on the property of Wentz Farm, hence the name. When thoughts were given to use of the land, it was decided to build a single Recreation center to serve both Crescentville and the neighboring Lawndale Community, hence the name LAWN-CREST came to be. Later, the Free Library of Philadelphia built its LAWN-CREST Branch next door to the Rec. Center. Located on the far NW Corner of this plot of ground is the Engine 64 Firehouse and Police Station building, built in 1924. The Police station was closed in the 1960s, and now houses the department of L&I, while Engine 64 still is in daily use.
Economy.
Today, the two largest employers in the area are the NAVY Depot and Cardone Industries. Cardone is a parts remanufacturer, primarily in the auto industry. Founded in 1970, it is one of the earliest "green" companies in the world. They have taken over many of the buildings for their use, which were left abandoned by earlier industries in the area. Their primary headquarters is in the former Stokes Vacuum Plant on Tabor Road while their primary factory facility is on Rising Sun Avenue, just below Adams Ave.
The median home price ranges from $80–90,000 for an East Side Row (there are few if any singles or twins on the East Side), and $125,000 and up for a West Side Stone Front Row, up to $275,000 for a West Side Single.

Lawndale, Philadelphia

Lawndale is a neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia. It is located near Rising Sun and Oxford avenues and is south of Cottman Avenue.
Despite the city's notation on the link below, Lawndale originally was named back in the 1880s - The name can be found on City Maps and Reading Railroad Maps dating back to the late 19th Century. Prior to that, the community was referred to as Marburg, with its central "business area" around the Kensington & Oxford Turnpike/Second Street Pike (Rising Sun Ave) and Benner, Colgate, and Comly streets. Included in this "industrial" area were the Marburg Bottling Company and a slaughter house, among other businesses. Its more residential end was near the current intersection of Rising Sun Avenue and Levick Street. Levick Street is home to many of the oldest nonfarming homes in the community, many of which were built out of wood. The oldest building still standing in the original community is what is now the Campbell's Funeral Home, which was at one time Paul Mahle's General store in addition to being a farm house. Several older stone homes surround this property and were all part of the Hellerman farm complex. The Hellerman Farms (multiple) owned the most property in this area when it was part of Oxford Township prior to the turn of the 20th century. Much of it was bought up by the Wentz Family of Olney after the 1854 consolidation act. Other land owners included the Fords, the Drakes, the Wolfs, the Brous, the Passmores, the Fesmiers, the Gillhams, the Atwoods, the Unruhs, the Woodfalls, and the Pierce Families.
The name Lawndale can be traced on paper back to when the Philadelphia, Newtown & New York Railroad built its line through the area. One of the first stations listed north of Olney was Lawndale. It was opened in the 1890s and later closed, only to be reopened in the early teens of the new century to accommodate the growing community. The railroad was taken over by the Philadelphia & Reading by then and a small room was leased from a gentleman who lived at the bottom of Robbins Street, whose home faced the railroad. This temporary arrangement lasted for well over 30 years, until the owner died and the railroad was forced to build a small shelter. The Lawndale Station has seen many reincarnations over the years and is still in daily use by SEPTA with the stopping of 45 scheduled passenger trains a day and over 350 round trip fares a day. The physical location of the Lawndale Station property is actually in Montgomery County/Cheltenham Township, while nearby Cheltenham Station (which primarily serves the North end of Lawndale in addition to some residents from Cheltenham, PA. and seeing an additional 400 round trip fares a day) is actually located in Philadelphia County.
Lawndale is home to many diverse residential buildings. There are blocks of rows, mixed in with singles, twins and even large estate type homes. Most of the community was built in three stages: pre-1920s, 1920–1930 and 1950–1960. Fewer than 40 homes have been built since the 1970s. This mix of housing has kept the area as one of the more desirable places to live in Philadelphia, and is often a secret to many. People are always surprised at the diversity of the housing stock. 
The community is home to many Protestant churches, no less than 12 actually, with the oldest being the Trinity Oxford Church which traces its beginnings in the community back to 1698, when the area was part of Oxford Township. Church records confirm the issue of when the community was named; they record the Lawndale name as far back as the late 19th century. 
The area is served by two Catholic parishes and one Catholic School: St. William's Parish at Rising Sun and Devereaux Ave. and Presentation BVM Parish at Martins Mill/Old Soldiers Road and Hasbrook Ave in nearby Cheltenham Township with a combined Catholic Population of about 9,000 people, or 3,000 families. Only Presentation BVM School Remains, as St. William School was closed in 2012 due to low enrollment. There was a public school also located within, Lawndale Elementary, but this school was closed some time in the 1980s and sold to the Cedar Grove Church (Rising Sun and Tabor) which has operated it successfully as the Cedar Grove Christian Academy. The former Lawndale School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Combined enrollment of the two schools is just over 800 students.
There are no public schools that officially serve the community of Lawndale. The nearest public grade school is Ben Franklin Elementary in Crescentville, which has just over 1100 students and Creighton Elementary, also in Crescenville, with over 800 students. Local high schools are Northeast in Rhawnhurst and Samuel Fels High School in Oxford Circle/Summerdale. Catholic high school students have several options, but the closest and most popular local school was Cardinal Dougherty in Olney, until its closure in 2009.
The Lawncrest Recreation Center serves both the Lawndale and Crescentville communities, as does the Lawncrest Library and Engine 64 Fire House. All are located on Rising Sun Ave between Lardner and Comly streets.
There is a main business district that stretches from Robbins to Longshore Avenue and is home to well over 200 stores of various degrees. With the boundaries of Lawndale, which are Comly Street to the South, SEPTA/CSX Transportation to the West, Longshore/Tyson Ave to the North and Pennway Ave to the East there are well over 500 businesses. One of the Largest employers in the area is the Naval Supply Depot which at one time employed over 5,000 workers. Though only 1,500 remain, it is still the single largest employer in the area.

Trystan Layne

Trystan Layne is an American pop rock band that formed in Austin, Texas in 2004 consisting of Edison Bradley (lead vocals/rhythm guitar/keyboard), Adam Franklyn Rogoyski (lead guitar/backing vocals), Joshua Applebee (bass guitar), and Tyson Sheth (drums). The group released their debut album Tomorrow Never Comes in 2008.
Band history.
Formation (2003–2007).
In 2003, at the age of 21, vocalist Edison Bradley was busy with schoolwork attending the University of Texas at Austin. While learning how to play the guitar in his free time, Bradley began his first attempts at songwriting. As music began to overpower all other interests in his life, close friend Mark Rogoyski introduced Edison to his brother Adam. With many common interests between them, Adam and Edison began collaborating on new music while playing shows around town and at the university as a duo. Despite auditioning numerous members for the band, Adam and Edison had a difficult time finding people they truly worked well with.
Tomorrow Never Comes (2007–present).
Without a proper drummer and bass player, Adam and Edison entered the recording process in late 2005 at SugarHill Studios armed with session players John Simmons and Eric Jarvis. Under the name Trystan Layne, they began work with tracking engineer Joshua Applebee and producer Dan Workman (Destiny's Child, Southern Backtones, Culturcide). Although they were initially aiming to record an extended play album for demo purposes, the team chemistry within the group was so good that the writing continued throughout the recording process, making way for a full album release. When news of a full album came to life, Austin artist and friend Adam Deats began working on the album artwork, which was to be inspired by the undertones presented in the music. 
Midway through the process, tracking engineer Joshua Applebee (bass), along with his former Just Alleviate the Symptoms band mate Tyson Sheth (drums), formally joined Adam and Edison to make up the current Trystan Layne. With the band complete, producer Dan Workman turned to SugarHill Studios engineer Steve Christensen to mix the project. With their online release, the band will begin to tour for this record in the summer of 2009.

City at the End of Time

City at the End of Time is a 2008 science fiction novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was published in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom. The story follows three drifters in present-day Seattle who are tormented by strange dreams of the Kalpa, a city one hundred trillion years in the future. The Kalpa is attempting to ward off the Typhon, an inexplicable entity that has consumed the rest of the ancient universe and broken down the laws of physics.
The novel belongs to the Dying Earth subgenre. It is rooted in hard science fiction, but also incorporates several other genres, including fantasy and horror. Bear called it science fiction "stretched to the nth degree". He said that in the novel he honors those writers who changed the face of science fiction and fantasy, including William Hope Hodgson and Arthur C. Clarke, and pays homage to Hodgson's 1912 novel, "The Night Land", with which "City at the End of Time" shares a number of plot elements.
The novel received a mixed reception from critics. Some reviewers were impressed by the novel's scope and grandiosity, while others felt that the characters were underdeveloped and the story was difficult to follow. "New Scientist" described the first half of the book as "a gripping, original tale", but complained that in the second half Bear over-complicates the story with "too many ideas, images, mythologies and distractions". "City at the End of Time" was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 2009.
Plot summary.
"City at the End of Time" is about the Kalpa, the last city on Earth, one hundred trillion years in the future. The novel's backstory describes how the aging universe continued expanding and its spacetime fabric weakened. With the galaxies burnt out, humanity dispersed across the cosmos, where they encountered the Typhon, an inexplicable entity that was destroying the decaying universe. It consumed matter and replaced space-time with emptiness and inconsistencies beyond the laws of physics. The resulting Chaos spread rapidly, driving some humans back to ancient Earth with its rekindled sun. In an attempt to fend off the approaching Typhon, leaders of the dying Earth sent for Polybiblios, a human living with the Shen, an ancient alien race. Polybiblios returned to Earth with his adopted daughter, Ishanaxade, a being he had constructed from "fate-logs" of intelligent species collected by the Shen. After the Shen system fell, and the Chaos surrounded Earth, its leaders instructed everybody to convert themselves from primordial (real) matter to noötic (virtual) mass. As each city fell, its inhabitants retreated to the last remaining cities, the Kalpa and Nataraja. Using knowledge he had gleaned from the Shen, Polybiblios built reality generators to protect the Kalpa. Nataraja, which had rebelled against the instruction to convert to noötic matter, was left to fend for itself.
The novel alternates between the Kalpa and present-day Seattle, where three drifters, Ginny, Jack and Daniel are in possession of sum-runners, small stone-like talismans that give them "fate-shifting" abilities, whereby they can jump between fate-lines (world lines in a multiverse). Ginny and Jack also have disturbing dreams of the Kalpa, and are inexplicably connected to Jebrassy and Taidba, two "breeds" living in the future city. Fate-shifters and their sum-runners are hunted by "collectors" working for the Chalk Princess, an entity controlled by the Typhon from the future. These hunters place adverts in local newspapers inviting "dreamers" to contact them for "help".
In the future the Typhon is destroying history and world-lines are being broken, merging the past and the present. With the Chaos closing in on the Kalpa, the inhabitants (all noötic) are unable to venture outside the city walls. Under Ishanaxade's instructions they create "breeds", copies of ancient humans, using primordial matter. They send them in groups into the Chaos to find out if Nataraja still stands, but none return. Ishanaxade herself ventures out, but is not heard from again. As the Typhon starts breaching the Kalpa, the last batch of breeds, including Jebrassy and Taidba, leave the city in search of help. Armed with portable reality generators, they slowly progress through the unreal landscape in search of the rebel city.
Meanwhile the Chaos has reached all the way back to the present-day, and an event called the Terminus hits Seattle: the past, present and future collide and world-lines are severed. Ginny, Jack and Daniel, having evaded the hunters, trek across a degenerating Seattle. Protected by their sum-runners, they are drawn to Nataraja, where Ishanaxade is waiting. While still in the Kalpa, Ishanaxade had instructed Polybiblios to create the sum-runners containing "fragmented Babels", and in the Chaos she had sent them back to the "beginning of time". The sum-runners were programmed to lead the bearers to Ishanaxade when the expected Terminus occurred. The breeds, programmed to see Ishanaxade as their "mother", are also drawn to Nataraja, and Jebrassy and Taidba find their counterparts Jack and Ginny in the ruined city. The Kalpa falls to the Chaos, but in Nataraja, the sum-runners and their Babel fragments are united and history is recreated, causing the Typhon, now a failed god, to implode.
Background.
Greg Bear is an award-winning science fiction writer from Seattle. He has won three Nebula Awards, including the 1995 Award for Best Novel for "Moving Mars", and two Hugo Awards, including the 1983 Award for Best Novelette for "Blood Music". "City at the End of Time" was his first novel since "Quantico", which was first published in 2005. Bear's early influences included science fiction authors Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Poul Anderson.
Bear called "City at the End of Time" his "longest and most ambitious science fiction novel" he has written for a while. He said it is a "significant departure" from any of his previous works, and that it has a future history unlike anything he had tackled before. In an interview with "Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine" in September 2008, Bear said that what inspired him to write "City at the End of Time" was the question, "What if we're still primitive in our thinking physics and cosmology?", and this led to the idea for a story of "a Universe that goes on and on and on, and how reality might have to be changed by that circumstance." 
Bear told "Locus" magazine in August 2008 that he had found what appears to be a "continuity" in British science fiction: H. G. Wells's "The Time Machine" (1895), Arthur C. Clarke's "The City and the Stars" (1956), and Hodgson's "The House on the Borderland" (1908) and "The Night Land" (1912), all speculate on the evolution of humankind in the deep future. Bear said that these works, and their author's imagination, were a big influence on "City at the End of Time".
Analysis and genre.
Science fiction critic John Clute said ""City at the End of Time" is an example of a novel in dialogue with past works of SF." He said that Bear pays homage to William Hope Hodgson's 1912 novel, "The Night Land", with which "City at the End of Time" shares a number of plot elements. Both books include characters who dream of cities in the far future (the Kalpa, and the Last Redoubt in "The Night Land") which are surrounded by encroaching chaos. The Kalpa also draws on Arthur C. Clarke's future city, Diaspar in his 1956 novel, "The City and the Stars". Influences of other past works on "City at the End of Time" include H. P. Lovecraft's novella "The Shadow Out of Time" (1936), in which people exchange personalities in dreams across time, and Olaf Stapledon's "Last and First Men" (1930), in which the last of humanity in the deep future mentally contact people from the past. Lovecraft's "The Shadow Out of Time" was in turn also influenced by "The Night Land", which Lovecraft is said to have thought highly of.
Bear admired Hodgson's imagination which, in "The Night Land", had created the Last Redoubt as a "technological preserve" in the far future to keep out monsters that humanity had previously created, and which had evolved over long periods of time. But Bear's interpretation of "The Night Land" is that this future landscape is a "metaphysical place", and the monsters are "not creatures of this Earth". For Bear, this explanation broadens the novel's scope, and opens the door to other interpretations. 
Another influence on "City at the End of Time" are the short stories, "The Universal Library" (1901) by Kurd Lasswitz and "The Library of Babel" (1941) by Jorge Luis Borges, which science fiction and mystery author Peter Heck believes is intentional. Books feature prominently in the novel in both present-day Seattle and the Kalpa in the future, and Heck sees it as "a metaphor that anyone whose life is built around books—whether as a writer, reader, or bookseller—can readily empathize with." 
Clute notes that the Kalpa is not, as the title suggests, the last city; they "believe" they are, but the last city is Nataraja, "the city beyond the city at the end of time". Clute says that the Typhon is "a kind of god and a kind of quasi-animate principle of destruction" that is attempting to destroy the universe because it "cannot tolerate being told" or "observed". The creation and evolution of the universe is observed and recorded, and the Typhon will not tolerate this telling. In the Kalpa, Polybiblios creates Babel fragments ("Borgesian libraries that do not end") that, when brought together, will form a "backstory" that retells the history of the universe and overwhelms the Typhon. 
"City at the End of Time" is rooted in hard science fiction, but includes several other genres. SFF World said the novel is similar to Stephen King's "Dark Tower", where "an ultimate destination that defies both space and time are at the heart" of both stories. But whereas King focuses on "fantastical elements", Bear adopts a "scientific approach". SFF World described "City at the End of Time" as "an Epic Science Fiction novel elements of thriller and horror with some downright creepy characters." Kirkus Reviews called the book an "eschatological fantasy", and science fiction critic Paul Kincaid says the novel has "plotting and language [that seem to have been borrowed wholesale from fantasy". Bear himself said the novel could be fantasy or horror, but called it science fiction "stretched to the nth degree". "City at the End of Time" is generally referred to as a "Dying Earth" story, and is categorized under the Dying Earth subgenre.
Reception.
A review in "Publishers Weekly" described "City at the End of Time" as a "complex, difficult and beautifully written tale will appeal to sophisticated readers who prefer thorny conundrums to fast-paced action". A reviewer for the "Library Journal" said the novel "plung[es readers into a visceral experience of cosmological theory and the big creation stories of mythology". A review in "New Scientist" described the first half of the book as "a gripping, original tale" with the portrayal of the fate-shifters's talents as "nothing short of brilliant", but complained that in the second half Bear over-complicates the story with "too many ideas, images, mythologies and distractions". The reviewer said that a promising story "whips itself up into a virtually incomprehensible final act". Science fiction critic John Clute described the book as "cosmological fiction without a net", and complained that Bear rushes through the story too quickly and does not dwell long enough on locations like the Kalpa to make it memorable. He said that the flight to the future of Ginny, Jack and Daniel "gets a touch Frodo-in-Mordor at places".
Writing in a review in "Asimov's Science Fiction", science fiction and mystery author Peter Heck called "City at the End of Time" a "big, sweeping, heavily symbolic tale", and "one of Bear's most ambitious". He said that while the story could have focused more on the future city, "in the end, the plotlines come together, and the complexities merge into a satisfying unity". Speculative fiction writer Simon Petrie writing in "Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine" was impressed by the book's "grandiosity to the total synthesis of cosmology and myth", and Bear's "ability to encapsulate a universal future history in just the one book", but found the mix of science, fantasy, horror, mythology and religion a little "incongruous" at times. Petrie also felt that the use of so many "viewpoint characters" results in these characters being underdeveloped, and tends to " the pathos as the plot edges towards climax". 
In a review in the online speculative fiction magazine Strange Horizons, Tony Keen was critical of Bear's novel, saying that the present and future passages "do not mesh terribly well", and that it is "too long" with "too many ideas". He complained that the book was difficult to follow and that Bear keeps "moving the goalposts as it suits his narrative". Keen said that for a science fiction novel, he was surprised at its "lack of consistency", and called it more a work of fantasy than science fiction. He said the "revelations" at the end still did not help explain what had happened, but that "by this point, it was for me hard to care". A review in the "Oakland Tribune" complained that Bear, who it felt is not strong on "crafting memorable characters", "struggles" with the novel's multiple viewpoints. The review added that while he "takes a long time to get there, and arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.
Science fiction critic Paul Kincaid had mixed feelings about the novel. In a review at the SF Site webzine he criticized the characterisation saying that he could not always separate the main characters. Kincaid questioned the need for the supernatural entity, the Typhon, which is never developed. He described the "end of time" sequence as "the most powerful science fictional moment in this entire book", saying that he found it "far more scary, far more gripping, than any supernatural intervention". Kincaid said that while he found the book "ambitious" and "intellectually satisfying", "somehow the whole feels less than the sum of its parts". 
In another review at the SF Site, Greg L. Johnson wrote that while "City at the End of Time" provides plenty of "wonder, awe, and a sense of humanity in the face of an implacable universe", he feels that Bear does not quite succeed with this ambitious story of the fate of reality and the universe at large. Johnson described it as "an immensely complicated story" that unfolds by means of "hints and allusions". He said that even the book's ending only hints at what the gathered role players had achieved. Johnson wrote that while Bear's depictions of events on a grand scale, like the decay of Seattle, are good, his portrayal of the key players against this backdrop is not as strong.
