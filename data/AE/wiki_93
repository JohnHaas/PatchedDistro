Mourning Becomes Electra (film)

Mourning Becomes Electra is a 1947 American film by Dudley Nichols adapted from the 1931 Eugene O'Neill play of the same title. The film stars Rosalind Russell, Michael Redgrave, Raymond Massey, Katina Paxinou, Leo Genn and Kirk Douglas. 
It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Michael Redgrave) and Best Actress in a Leading Role (Rosalind Russell). Originally released by RKO Radio Pictures at nearly three hours, it was eventually edited down to 105 minutes (losing more than an hour) after it performed poorly at the box office and won no Oscars. It has since been restored to its full length and shown on Turner Classic Movies.
An Oscar upset occurred in connection with the film. All who saw it had taken it for granted that Rosalind Russell would win for her performance as Lavinia, to the point that Russell actually began to rise from her seat just before the winner's name was called. However, it was Loretta Young, and not Russell, who was named Best Actress for her performance in "The Farmer's Daughter".
The movie recorded a loss of $2,310,000, making it one of RKO's biggest financial disasters.
Plot.
A wealthy New England family, the Mannons, await the return of patriarch Ezra, general for the Union in the Civil War, and son Orin, a timid young man before becoming an Army officer.
Lavinia, who adores her father, is shocked to see mother Christine kissing another man. Worse yet, the man is sea captain Adam Brant, someone whom Lavinia has long fancied herself, even though Peter Niles has been courting her.
Learning from family servant Seth that, complicating matters further, Adam is actually a relative, a son of Lavinia's uncle, causes her to confront her mother. To her astonishment, Lavinia finds out that Christine is completely aware of the family relationship, but has hated Ezra since the day she married him.
Adam has hidden motives as well. He hates the Mannons for the way they treated his mother, who is now deceased. He is seeking revenge by toying with Christine's affections. But when she comes to him with a plot to kill Ezra, poisoning him, Adam is reluctant to go that far with his scheme.
Ezra returns home. His harrowing experiences during the war have persuaded him to try for a closer relationship with his wife. Christine is thrown by this, but elects to proceed with her plan to kill him. Ezra does indeed die, but Lavinia comes into possession of the pills that her mother used to poison him.
One tragedy follows another. Orin decides to shoot Adam for what he's done. Christine commits suicide. Lavinia decides to marry Peter after all, but his sister Hazel discloses that her family has all but disowned Peter for having anything to do with the Mannons.
Orin is riddled with guilt and kills himself as well. All is lost for Lavinia, who has Seth nail shut the doors and windows to their home, locking herself away from the world forever.

Destine

Destine is a rock band that formed in Tilburg, the Netherlands in 2006.
History.
Originally from the Netherlands, Destine has a sound which is similar to bands like Fall Out Boy, Paramore and Simple Plan.
The five youngsters joined forces in 2006 and released the "A Dozen Dreams EP". After that, a time of intensive touring followed: in the first year they played 70 shows in the Netherlands, England, Wales, Germany, France and Belgium. Destine also shared the stage with bands like New Found Glory and Fall Out Boy. The large number of shows resulted in a rapidly growing fan base and several songs getting airplay on national radio and TV. Their song "Last Scene of a Plane Crash" was featured as a leader tune on TV station Comedy Central.
In December 2008, Destine signed with record label Sony Music and traveled to Orlando, Florida to record with producer James Paul Wisner, who has worked with bands such as Paramore and New Found Glory. He was impressed by the songs and was convinced that the band has the potential of achieving international success.
The first result of the collaboration, single "In Your Arms", entered Holland's charts in the first week of release, and soon received frequent airplay on several national radio stations. The single has been supported by a highly rewarded video, shot near San Francisco by director Marco de la Torre. In its first weeks, the video hit several YouTube charts. The song was also used for a commercial on Holland's largest TV station. Destine was featured on the cover of "Up Magazine". The song was also featured in the video game "Pro Evolution Soccer 2011".
In summer 2009, Destine toured frequently in the Netherlands and abroad. One of the highlights was the Lowlands Festival, one of Holland's major outdoor festivals. In September 2009 Destine returned to the US to record their debut full length, again with Wisner. The album was released in early 2010 by Sony Music.
On 17 April, a new music video was released for Spiders.
On 23 April, Destine announced via their website that they were flying to Orlando, Florida to record a new single, again being produced by James Paul Wisner. Recording was between 27 April and 3 May, and the result was a cover of the song "Down" by Jay Sean and Lil Wayne.
Single "Stay" was released on June 19, 2011. On August 3, the band's debut album was released for the first time in Japan including three bonus tracks, the cover song "Down", the remixed and remastered "The Disappointment" (taken from their debut EP) and the Night Skies, the only song written during the Lightspeed recording session that didn't make it to the final cut of the album as the band didn't think it fit the rest of the album as a whole.
Destine performed in August on the Netherlands radio station FN "Wait Forever" for the first time, along with several cover songs, the Japan bonus tracks for Lightspeed and "Stay". They also announced that the album will be released in mid-2012. On September 30 the band will release their next single "Thousand Miles" as well as the music video.
On October 18, 2011, the band announced that drummer Robin Faas quit. They also announced that Jordy Datema will take his place in the band. On October 20 Destine has played its last show with Robin Faas in Breda at the "Breda zegt Ja" festival.
On March 5, 2012, the band released their first ever movie, "FOOTPRINTS: a year in the life".
On March 30, the band released their second studio album, "Illuminate". The album received lots of positive reviews and was on the Netherlands Chart, where they ranked 42 on April 7. The band recorded the album with James Paul Wisner again, and also with David Bendeth, who had worked with bands like All Time Low and Paramore, and mixed a few songs in this album.
Influences.
Lead vocalist Robin van Loenen stated in an interview: 
Trivia.
The Song "In Your Arms" is on the soundtrack of the football game Pro Evolution Soccer 2011.

Lawrence Bridges

Lawrence Bridges is a writer and film maker.
Career.
Bridges began his film career as a production assistant on Francis Ford Coppola's film "The Conversation". He became an editor of music videos, most notably with director Bob Giraldi for Michael Jackson's "Beat It", and director Joe Pytka for "Dirty Diana", and "The Way You Make Me Feel". He then founded the post-production company Red Car Inc. and began directing and editing commercials for clients such as Coca-Cola, Nike, Reebok, Honda commercials featuring Lou Reed and Devo, Michelob Beer, among many others. He cast Brad Pitt in a Pringles commercial, one of the actor's first gigs. For the Rock the Vote campaign, Bridges directed an ad featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Sarah Jessica Parker.
In a 1987 "Rolling Stone" interview Stanley Kubrick, in reference to a series of Michelob commercials that Bridges had edited, remarked that these were "some of the most spectacular examples of film art" and "the editing was some of the most brilliant work I've ever seen."
Bridges was named "Best Advertising Auteur" by "Connoisseur Magazine" in 1989, inspiring the magazine to write, "Whenever you see an ad that verges on art, chances are good that Bridges had a hand in it--as either director, editor or graphic designer." "...The techniques he pioneered as a backlash to formulaic commercials are now staples of the industry, as well as hallmarks of countless Hollywood feature films aiming for 'realism.'".
Work.
"12", initially projected on buildings from parking lots in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas, began the urban Guerrilla drive-in movement in the early 2000s (decade). Robert Koehler of "Variety Magazine" called the film "A dizzying, unforgettable adventure" while Dean Treadway of "Filmicability" placed it among his favorite 100 films of all time. "12" has also played at over 15 festivals worldwide and was honored with a "Best of Fest" award at the Syracuse International Film and Video Festival in 2004. The December 2003 issue of "American Cinematographer" featured an article on Lawrence's cinematography for the film as well. "12" continues to play at various midnight screenings across Los Angeles.
Bridges' first poetry appeared in Stanford’s "Sequoia Magazine" in 1971 and later in "Poetry" and "The New Yorker", while Bridges was starting his career in filmmaking in New York city, balancing jobs in editing TV commercials and driving a taxi cab.
In 2006, Bridges produced "StrangerAdventures", which was the first internet/TV game show where players from anywhere in the world could become participants with the main characters. The participants competed for cash and prizes during the week-long game. The show was nominated for a New Media Emmy award that same year.
Bridges is the creator of "The Interview", (Kerry Reid, "Chicago Tribune",) a theatrical production in which an interviewer instructs a solo performer to respond to instructions with personal stories in front of a live audience. The performer, a different one each night, is not given any prior knowledge of the instruction or prompts that will come their way.
Bridges is the President and CEO of Red Car Inc., a post-production company he founded in 1982 with offices in New York, Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles.

19 Kids and Counting

19 Kids and Counting (formerly 17 Kids and Counting and 18 Kids and Counting), rendered graphically as 19 Kids & Counting in its onscreen logo, is an American reality television show on TLC. The show is about the Duggar family, which consists of parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their 19 children—nine girls and ten boys (including two sets of twins), all of whose names begin with the letter "J". The series began on September 29, 2008. Season eight is slated to premiere on April 1, 2014 
Background.
The Duggars live in Tontitown, Arkansas, and originally appeared in several TLC and Discovery Health one-hour specials, most of which focused on four of Michelle's last five deliveries.
Jim Bob Duggar has one older sister, Deanna, who occasionally appears on the show. Michelle Duggar has six siblings. The couple met in the early 1980s when Jim Bob Duggar and a fellow church member were sent for a follow-up visit after Michelle Duggar had experienced a religious conversion. Jim Bob and Michelle were married on July 21, 1984.
The Duggars elected to delay having children and practiced birth control. It was four years before Josh, their eldest, was born in 1988. They then resumed using birth control; despite precautions, they conceived again but Michelle miscarried. Michelle revealed that they had named the child Caleb despite not knowing the sex. Believing the miscarriage was due to the contraceptive, the Duggars quit using birth control. As they explained, they decided to allow God to determine the number of children they would have. Shortly thereafter, Michelle became pregnant with her first set of twins, Jana and John-David. Thereafter, Michelle has given birth approximately once every year and a half.
The Duggars are devout fundamentalist Independent Baptists. In accordance with their beliefs, they only watch what they consider to be wholesome family television on DVD, and various historical events. They have filtered Internet service. They adhere to what they consider to be standards of modesty in clothing; females wear long hair and skirts below the knees, males are short-haired and clean-shaven. They also wear modest-wear swimsuits. Instead of dating, they practice chaperoned courtship, which encompasses the couple abstaining from any physical contact. In the event of engagement, the suitor seeks permission from the young woman's father before proposing to her. The children are homeschooled using a mix of materials, including those of Switched On Schoolhouse, Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP), and Accelerated Christian Education (ACE). For college studies, several of the older kids use the CollegePlus! program.
The Duggars raise their children using a buddy system, wherein an older sibling is assigned to a younger sibling and assists in the latter's primary care. According to Michelle, "They help them with their little phonics lessons and games during the day and help them practice their music lessons. They will play with them or help them pick out the color of their outfit that day and just all of those types of things." In 2004, Michelle Duggar won the "Young Mother of the Year Award" in Arkansas, which is sponsored by American Mothers Incorporated.
Jim Bob Duggar served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2002. He later became a real estate agent and investor. The Duggars' income is derived from the rental proceeds of the commercial properties they own. They live debt-free, which Jim Duggar has said is "the fruit of Jim Sammons' Financial Freedom Seminar" he attended years ago. (Sammons' Seminar is endorsed by IBLP.). The construction of their 7,000-square-foot (650-square- meter) house was begun by the family in 2000 when they bought the lot and ordered the frame. Discovery Networks completed it, by finding local Arkansas construction workers to donate their skills and time. The home was completed on January 20, 2006. Some of the painting, the decorating, furnishings, some of the appliances, and other finishing touches—such as a stocked pantry—were provided by Discovery Networks and corporate sponsors as part of the one-hour television special entitled "16 Children and Moving In".
During the series.
On December 18, 2008, Michelle gave birth to Jordyn-Grace via Caesarean section.
On September 26, 2008, Josh and Anna were married. In about four months into their marriage, the couple learned that they were expecting their first child. They learned that the baby was a girl and named her Mackynzie Renee. They welcomed Mackynzie on October 8, 2009 just a couple of days after their first wedding anniversary. A few months later, Josh and Anna learned that she was pregnant with their second child, however the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.
On December 10, 2009, Michelle gave birth via emergency Caesarean section to Josie Brooklyn, three months prematurely. Michelle was rushed to the hospital for gallstones and it was there that doctors discovered she had pre-eclampsia and performed an emergency delivery. Josie weighed 1 lb, 6oz at birth. A week after the birth, Michelle reported that Josie was "doing as well as can be expected for a baby at her age. We are taking each hour as it comes." On April 6, 2010, after nearly four months in the hospital, Michelle and Jim Bob were able to take Josie to their rental in Little Rock, while they awaited the okay to take her home to Tontitown. However, on April 8, 2010, Josie Duggar was readmitted to the hospital after her vital signs dropped. Fortifiers that had been added to breast milk to help her gain weight appeared to be the cause. The Duggars were able to take Josie home to Tontitown on June 23, 2010. Michelle said Josie was doing well and weighed about nine pounds. By that December she weighed 15 lbs. 12 ounces.
The couple had discussed the possibility of having more children, with Michelle Duggar saying,
On June 7, 2011, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's book "The Duggars: 20 and Counting!" was released. This was their second book. The first was "A Love That Multiplies", released on December 2, 2008.
On November 8, 2011, Michelle Duggar and family appeared on NBC's "Today Show" to announce that she was expecting their 20th child. On December 8, 2011, Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar revealed that she miscarried. Six days later, they held a memorial service for their unborn girl whom they named Jubilee Shalom (which means celebration and peace).
On Mackynzie's first birthday, Josh and Anna learned that they were expecting again and that the baby was a boy. The couple welcomed their second child, Michael James, on June 15, 2011. They learned that they were pregnant again in September 2012, right after the family got back from their Asian trip. During Anna's pregnancy with their third child, Josh was offered a job at Family Research Council. Marcus Anthony joined his family on June 2, 2013 under the care of a midwife at her home. On June 18, 2013, it was announced that Josh was hired to be the executive director of the Family Research Council's political action committee and that he and his family would be moving to Washington, D.C..
On September 18, 2013, it was announced that Jessa Duggar is in a courtship, with Ben Seewald, whom she met through their church, and that the couple were "enjoying getting to know each other and are recommending sermons to one another."

USNS Potomac (T-AO-150)

USNS "Potomac" (T-AO-150) was a United States Navy "Maumee"-class oiler in non-commissioned service with the Military Sea Transportation Service, later Military Sealift Command, from 1957 to 1961.
"Potomac", fifth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, was laid down at Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Chester, Pennsylvania,
on 9 June 1955 and launched on 8 October 1956, sponsored by Mrs. T. H. Robbins, Jr. She entered non-commissioned U.S. Navy service under the control of the Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS), with a primarily civilian crew on 30 January 1957.
"Potomac" carried fuel oil and aviation fuel to the United States armed forces overseas until 26 September 1961, when she was wracked by fire and a series of explosions while alongside the Aviation Fuels Terminal Pier at Morehead City, North Carolina. Two men were killed in the explosions, and the forward part of the ship was declared a total loss. A disastrous waterfront fire was avoided by the prompt heroic action of "Potomac" crew members, United States Coast Guard personnel, and U.S. Marines, who prevented the fire from igniting large fuel storage tanks adjacent to the pier.
The 200-foot (61 m) stern section of the ship was cut away and towed to Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Newport News, Virginia, for salvage. A new bow and forebody was constructed at Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Chester, Pennsylvania and welded there to the salvaged stern section, with the bridge and crew accommodations aft. The reconstructed ship, SS "Shenandoah", entered service in 1965 and became USNS "Potomac" (T-AO-181) in 1976 when purchased by the Military Sealift Command

Monstania

Monstania is a tactical role-playing video game released for the SNES in 1996 by Pack-In-Video. This game was never released in North America, although fans have translated its ROM. The game is relatively short compared to other games in the genre.
Gameplay.
"Monstania" is a simple tactical RPG. The player can control two characters in battle, switching between them. Characters can attack, defend, use items, heal, or use special techniques unique to each character. Recovering and techniques costs Ability Points (AP), which can be restored with items, standing still for a turn, or having the other character take an action. Every battle is story related and typically ends when either all the monsters are defeated or the characters reach a certain spot on the stage. Some stages require puzzles to be solved and do not have enemies, such as switch pressing or floor cleaning stages.
Plot.
Setting.
"Monstania" takes place on the fictional continent Monstania. This continent features several different types of topography, including deserts, mountains, and forests. There are islands around Monstania, as well as the Mainland, although the characters never visit the Mainland.
Monstania used to be a home to the fairies, as had the Mainland, but the humans who lived there unknowingly drove them out. Currently, this is happening in Monstania, which is now sinking, a process sped up by Barambat.
Story.
The story follows Fron and his childhood girlfriend Tia as they journey through their homeland of Monstania. Fron, in search of fairies, meets Chitta, a fairy, while she is being pursued by Tania and Barambat, the game's primary antagonists. While exploring some nearby ruins, the group finds a mysterious blue stone, which seems to be related to Chitta and Tania and Barambat seem to be after it.
Chitta disappears after a few encounters with Tania and Barambat and Fron and Tia visit her grandfather on Pascal Island for clues about the stone, but he does not have any information for them. upon returning, the two meet Marx, Tania's brother. He helps fron and Tia defeat his sister, but is injured. Tia stays behind with him while Fron searches for Chitta.
Fron makes his way to Snowt, a large city on Monstania that always has snow. The town is overrun by berserk spirits and Fron has to fight his way to the castle, where he asks for permission to travel to Diamond Mountain, a sacred place that Chitta has gone to. Tia, worried, reunites with Fron and together they climb Diamond Mountain without permission. At the top, they find Chitta and Barambat, who is revealed to have once been a fairy who turned human to become more powerful and now wishes to cause the sinking of Monstania. Frustrated, Barambat admits that he would rather watch his old home sink than let the humans live there. Chitta and Fron defeat Barambat, who transforms into a grotesque ceature before being sealed in another world. The fairies approach Fron and Tia and inform them that they can no longer live on Monstania because the stone had been broken.

Lloyd C.V

__NOTOC__
The Lloyd C.V was a reconnaissance aircraft produced in Austria-Hungary during the First World War. It was a departure from Lloyd's previous reconnaissance types, which had all been based on a pre-war design. The C.V was a more compact and streamlined aircraft with an unusual wing structure. 
The design was largely conventional overall, except for the interplane struts. These were arranged in two sets, front and rear, with the rear sets consisting of two struts per wing, and the forward sets of only one strut per wing. When viewed from the front of the aircraft, rather than standing vertically, the rear struts formed a V-shape, converging to the point where they met the lower wings. From bottom wing to top, the single forward struts sloped inwards towards the centreline, matching the angle of the inboard rear struts. The fin was triangular and similar to the unit on earlier Lloyd designs, but featured an extension at the top of the rudder that reached over the top of the fixed part of the fin. With its curved leading edge and scalloped trailing edge, this rudder resembled the tail of a rooster, and gained the aircraft the nickname "Kikeriki" (German: "Cock-a-doodle-doo"). 
The wings departed from the usual structure of one or more spars surrounded by airfoil-shaped ribs and were built instead from ribs surrounded by longerons that stretched span-wise along the wings. This was all then covered in plywood sheeting. While this made for a strong, light structure, it also meant that repairs to damaged wings were difficult, and proved impossible to carry out in the field - damaged aircraft instead being sent back to depots for exchange. Another problem was identified in that moisture trapped inside the wings could have no way to escape easily and would cause the plywood skin to buckle or even delaminate.
Lloyd built 96 C.Vs in 1917, powered by Austro-Daimler engines, while WKF built another 48 with Benz engines. The type saw only brief front-line service before being relegated to secondary duties.

Basic Instructions (comics)

Basic Instructions is a webcomic by artist, comedian and writer Scott Meyer. The comic has been available on LiveJournal since 2003 and on the author's Web site since 2006. 
Three books have been published, the first two by Dark Horse Comics, all containing compilations of strips with some new content, forewords written
by the characters and commentary on the comics themselves.
Content and Format.
Each comic purports to provide instructions on a "how to" topic seemingly taken from everyday life, such as "How to Lie for Recreational Purposes" or "How to Win at Monopoly Without Losing a Friend", and then deals with the subject in a frequently perverse or unexpected manner. The characters in the comic are Scott Meyer himself and representations of the people he interacts with on a daily basis, such as his wife, his boss, and his best friend. The author has stated in interviews that many of the characters are based on real people.
Each comic contains four panels in a grid, and each panel typically contains instructions as well as the standard comic drawings. The author has said that he aims to include a joke in each panel. The unusual format has made it difficult for the author to publish it in standard print syndication, despite an attempt by Scott Adams of Dilbert to help Meyer reformat the cartoon for wider distribution. Meyer felt that the format required by newspaper would not permit him to use his personal brand of humor and story development which requires the four-panel, narrated layout..
Characters.
Main Characters.
The three main characters are based on Scott Meyer himself and his real-world wife Missy and best friend Rick.
Scott.
Scott is the main character and a somewhat autobiographical representation of the author in the comic, according to Meyer. Scott is generally depicted as being ironic, intelligent and geeky, interested in comic books, science fiction, and video games. He takes a laissez-faire attitude towards his work and his friends. He enjoys debate, but is frequently depicted in discussions or arguments as being on the losing side. Scott also appears as a younger version, more naive and with hair, and an older future version, who lives in a post-apocalyptic environment.
The visual depiction of Scott is also used for other characters such as Omnipresent Man and Rocket Hat. Those characters rarely interact with the "real" Scott. These alternates may be considered fantasy versions or alter-egos of the main character.
Missy.
Missy is Scott's wife. She also enjoys video games. Missy generally comes out on top in discussions, debates, and arguments with Scott. The art for Missy is also used for the superhero character The Judger.
Rick.
Rick is Scott's best friend, a failure at everything he does with incredibly bad luck, with the attendant low self-esteem. Rick is single with little chance on a future relationship. Rick's alter egos are the superheros Knifeketeer, Mister Everywhere and the science fiction villain the Moon Emperor.
Science Fiction Alter Egos.
The comic strip features regularly recurring strips dealing with a science fiction alternate reality in which the Moon Emperor is attempting to take control of the Earth, and is repeatedly foiled by the silent but intrepid Rocket Hat.
Rocket Hat.
Rocket Hat is Scott's science fiction alter ego. Rocket Hat never moves or speaks while he is being depicted, acting only off camera, and serves primarily as foil to the Moon Emperor. Generally a strip begins with Rocket Hat being captured by the Moon Emperor, and ends with him escaping through violence, ingenuity, or wits.
Moon Emperor.
The Moon Emperor is Rick's space fantasy character. He is the archetypal megalomaniac evil villain, capturing Rocket Hat at the beginning of most of his strips and allowing him to escape at the end. The Moon Emperor has powerful minions but is himself a pathetic and weak character who never achieves his long-planned overthrow of Earth. His slogan is "The details are unimportant!".
Super Hero Alter Egos.
The comic strip features regularly recurring strips dealing with a group of super heroes, generally with ineffective or useless powers, who spend more time discussing their problems than they do fighting crime.
Omnipresent Man.
Omnipresent Man is a fantasy character of Scott as a super hero. He is present everywhere in the world at the same time. He is also present everywhere else at the same time. This presents him with certain opportunities and certain problems.
Knifeketeer.
The knifeketeer is Rick's super hero alter ego. He wears a large number of different knives, but his primary weapon is a boxing glove on a stick. Possibly there is a knife concealed inside.
Macramayhem.
Jenkins' alter ego is Macramayhem. He serves primarily as a villain to combat the Knifeketeer.
Office Characters.
Mullet Boss.
He is the manager of the office and a depiction of a stereotypical lazy and superior boss, with some interesting quirks. In several comics he is depicted as incompetent and lazy, and he usually tries to blame Scott for it. Mullet Boss sometimes surprises with oddly creative, wise, or sensitive actions.
Jenkins.
Jenkins is a co-worker of Scott. He makes bad jokes, always refuses to fill in the weekly RJ-17 form and makes Scott do it. Like most in the office, he is incompetent and lazy. His views on women are perverted, with the result that the women in the office try to avoid him.
The Customer.
Often visits the office to check on progress of the work of undefined administrative nature. He is not expecting much, and usually gets disappointed. He verbally fights with whoever is assigned to talk to him - usually Scott.
Printed Media.
In September 2008 the first book, "Help Is on the Way", a compilation of the strips, was published by "Dark Horse Books", a division of "Dark Horse Comics". This book contains a foreword by Ric.
2010 saw the release of the second book, "Make with 90% Recycled Art", where Missy wrote the foreword and Ric provides an afterword.
In 2011 Scott published the third book, "The Curse of the Masking-Tape Mummy". Scott himself wrote the foreword.
Other media.
In August 2008, Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic, discussed "Basic Instructions" and syndication on his blog.

Hamburger Sailing Club

The Hamburger Segel-Club (Hamburger Sailing Club) (HSC), is one of the oldest and most active sailing clubs in Germany. This club is located by the shores of the Alster, in the heart of the harbor city of Hamburg and is one of the organizers of the Kiel Week together with the Yacht Club of Kiel, the Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee and the Norddeutscher Regattaverein. Taking place in the Bay of Kiel, this annual event is one of the largest and most prestigious sailing regattas in the world. 
The HSC also assists the Yacht Club of Lübeck and the Norddeutscher Regattaverein in the organization of the Travemünder Woche. 
History.
The predecessor of the present-day HSC was the Hamburger Yacht-Club, established in October 1892, out of which a group split in 1895. In 1926 this group merged with the Hamburger Segel-Verein. In 1927 it was registered as the "Hamburger Segel-Club" at the registry in Hamburg.
The founders of the original Hamburger Yacht-Club were yacht racing and cruising enthusiasts who joined the Deutscher Segler-Verband four weeks after establishing the club. 
In 1925 the club organized the North Sea Week (Nordseewoche) sailing competition off Heligoland. In 1927 it helped to organize the Travemünder Woche for the first time and since 1928 the Kieler Woche (Kiel Week) as well.
Five years after having been established the club had 343 members and 87 boats; 46 competitions had been organized in which a total of 922 sailcraft took part.
The best yachts of the club at the time were the "Freya", the "Ingeborg VIII" and Otto Schümann's "Carla IV".
Between 1934 and 1935, during Nazi times, all sailing clubs in Germany lost their autonomy and were arbitrarily joined to departments of the "Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen" (DRL), later renamed "Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen" (NSRL), like the "Wassersportverband" (Watersports Association). 
Since the NSRL, as a Nazi organization, was disbanded after Germany's defeat in World War II, the Hamburger Sailing Club had to be established anew, like other yacht clubs in West Germany at that time. Carl Georg Gewers led the club through the difficult postwar and rebuilding years. Among other achievements, he was able to convince the British occupation authorities to give back the seized sailing craft to the club. 
In 1950 the Hamburger Sailing Club helped to organize the Kieler Woche (Kiel Week) again. After that the club was able to grow and expand until today.

Einasto profile

The Einasto profile (or Einasto model) is a mathematical function that describes how the density formula_1 of a spherical stellar system varies with distance formula_2 from its center. Jaan Einasto introduced his model at a 1963 conference in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan.
The Einasto profile has the form
The parameter formula_4 controls the degree of curvature of the profile. This can be seen by computing the slope on a log-log plot:
The larger formula_4, the more rapidly the slope varies with radius (see figure). Einasto's law can be described as a generalization of a power law, formula_7, which has a constant slope on a log-log plot.
Einasto's model has the same mathematical form as Sersic's law, which is used to describe the surface brightness (i.e. projected density) profile of galaxies.
Einasto's model has been used to describe many types of system, including galaxies and dark matter halos.

Ralph Rowe

Ralph Emanuel Rowe (July 14, 1924 — February 29, 1996) was an American outfielder and manager in minor league baseball, and a coach at the Major League level. A native and lifelong resident of Newberry, South Carolina, Rowe threw right-handed, batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed . He graduated from Newberry High School and attended Newberry College.
Rowe's professional career got off to a rousing start in 1942, when he batted .357 for the Thomasville Hi-Toms, a Cleveland Indians affiliate in the Class D North Carolina State League. But he lost the next four full seasons (1943–1946) to military service and, despite batting .360 and leading the 1948 Class B Tri-State League in runs batted in (123), he spent most of his playing career at the Double-A level. Rowe's career reached its apex with a 14-game trial with the Los Angeles Angels of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1949. He played in the farm systems of the Indians, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox and the Washington Senators through 1958, then became a manager in the Washington/Minnesota Twins farm system from 1959–1971, winning two league championships. His overall record was 836–757 (.525).
He finally reached the Major Leagues as a coach, serving for four seasons with the Twins (1972–1975) as their third base coach, and four more (1981–1984) as the batting coach of the Baltimore Orioles. He was a member of the Orioles' staff during their 1983 world championship season. Rowe also served as a roving minor league batting coach for the Twins, Orioles, and, after 1984, the Montreal Expos.
He died in Newberry at the age of 71.

Dynamic frequency hopping

One of the key challenges of the cognitive radio based wireless networks, such as IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks (WRAN), is to address two apparently conflicting requirements: assuring Quality of Services (QoS) satisfaction for services provided by the cognitive radio networks, while providing reliable spectrum sensing for guaranteeing licensed user protection. To perform reliable sensing, in the basic operation mode on a single frequency band (the so-called “listenbefore-talk” mode) one has to allocate Quiet Times, in which no data transmission is permitted. Such periodic interruption of data transmission could impair the QoS of cognitive radio systems. 
This issue is addressed by an alternative operation mode proposed in IEEE 802.22 called Dynamic Frequency Hopping (DFH) where data transmission of the WRAN systems are performed in parallel with spectrum sensing without any interruption.

Allis-Chalmers 190XT

The Allis-Chalmers 190XT, also known as the "One-Ninety XT", is a diesel*-powered tractor that was produced by Allis-Chalmers. As its model number implies, it was based on the Allis-Chalmers D19, though it featured many alterations and improvements over the D19. The only difference between the 190 and the 190XT is the addition of a turbocharger on the XT. The 190 XT in stock form is rated at about 93 drawbar horsepower. They were produced from 1964 to 1971. The 190XT was notable for being able to outperform the 103 horsepower rated Allis-Chalmers D21 (until the D21 was turbocharged in 1965). 
Details.
The 190 XT had a six cylinder engine and a 3.875x4.25 inch bore/stroke. Its displacement was 301 cubic inches and its rated RPMs was 2200. This engine was a new design and, for the time, offered excellent performance for its displacement. Its main transmission, basically a carryover from the D19, had 4 forward and 1 reverse gear and was not synchronized. The 190 XT had a power director like the D Series, but it could smoothly shift on the go (clutch engaged)just like the D series. The main transmission could not be shifted while the PTO was engaged and turning and as such the 190 did not offer true live PTO. You could start and stop the tractor using the power director but you could not, for example, shuttle from forward to reverse without first stopping the PTO. The power director did split each gear allowing for a total of 8 forward speeds and 2 reverse speeds.
The 190XT, because it used many D19-size components in its powertrain, was intended to be at most a 100 horsepower tractor. However, many of them had their injection pump turned up, pushing them to 120 horsepower or more. This led to various powertrain failures, especially in earlier models due to a light rear end design. An improved design was introduced and many tractors were updated with the heavier duty rear end. Also, the 190's transmission did not tolerate grinding during gear shifting well and this led to many tractors with transmissions that would not stay in certain gears. As such the tractor got somewhat of a bad reputation among those that weren't AC fans.
The 190XT was gradually beefed up, becoming the 190XT Series III and eventually the model 200. When operated as intended by the manufacturer, the 190 was a reliable tractor. However, this meant accepting its limitations and not, for instance, trying to shift it like a John Deere 4020 with its synchromesh transmission or pulling implements designed for D21-size tractors.
Despite stiff market competition from the John Deere 4020 and others, Allis did sell many 190XT tractors and there are many still working today. Allis-Chalmers and the Gleaner Harvester Corp. was restructured in 1985 and eventually became Allis-Gleaner Co. AGCO Corporation and as such what parts are still available for these tractors are mostly available through AGCO.

Náttúra

"Náttúra" is a song written and recorded by Icelandic singer Björk. The track was released as a single promoting the protection of the Icelandic environment. All proceeds from the single will be donated to the Náttúra Foundation, the environmental preservation campaign after which the song is named. The single was initially discovered by Björk's French language fan website and was later confirmed by the singer's representatives. It was released on October 20, 2008 as an iTunes Exclusive, and had a wide digital release on October 27. The song was given a physical release on April 20, 2009 with a white label vinyl released by One Little Indian's web shop.
Pitchfork Media has reported that Radiohead's Thom Yorke contributed to the vocals on "Náttúra". Björk and Yorke previously worked together while recording "I've Seen It All" from "", the soundtrack to "Dancer in the Dark". Yorke's contribution to the single was initially debated, as Billboard Music stated that the singer-songwriter has not recorded any new material with Björk since 2000. Björk's publicist confirmed that Yorke's contributions were made via file-sharing during the summer of 2008, while Björk was on her Volta tour. Yorke's voice can be heard as atmospheric haze in the background of the song. Other contributors to the track include Brian Chippendale of Lightning Bolt, and frequent collaborators Mark Bell and Matthew Herbert.
This is Björk's first solo single to be released entirely in Icelandic. It is also the first not to have a corresponding album or video. However, it is bundled with the digital download and included on the digipak edition of Björk's 2011 album "Biophilia".

He served as the chairman of the Department of Economics at Boston University from 1992 to 1998, and currently teaches at Harvard University, serving as a Senior Lecturer and Director of Undergraduate Studies in Harvard's Economics Department.
Biography.
Miron is an outspoken libertarian. He was one of the 166 economists to sign a letter to congressional leaders in opposition to the bailout plan put forth by the U.S. federal government in response to the global financial crisis of September–October 2008. He advocated that those companies that floundered during the crisis should be bankrupt instead of receiving government help. He has proposed three policy reforms to help the US economy recover from the financial crisis: cutting entitlements, freezing regulation, and replacing the existing tax code with a flat tax on consumption. Miron has also spoken out against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, arguing that it is economically unfeasible and will increase the US deficit; instead, he suggests limiting government intervention is the best way to lower overall health care costs and make health care accessible to the most amount of people. He has studied the effects of drug criminalization for 15 years, and argues that all drugs should be legalized.

USNS Shoshone (T-AO-151)

USNS "Shoshone" (T-AO-151), later T-AO-151T, was a United States Navy "Maumee"-class oiler, later transport oiler, in non-commissioned service with the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), later Military Sealift Command, from 1957 until probably the mid-1980s.
"Shoshone", third U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, was laid down at Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Chester, Pennsylvania,
on 15 August 1955 and launched on 17 January 1957, sponsored by Mrs. James E. Van Zandt. She entered non-commissioned U.S. Navy service under the control of the Military Sea Transport Service, later the Military Sealift Command, with a primarily civilian crew in April 1957.
"Shoshone" went into operation for MSTS as a civilian-manned ship. Her role was point‑to‑point delivery of fuel oil and gasoline to the U.S. armed forces at a variety of Atlantic and Pacific ports. She eventually was reclassified as a "transport oiler", resulting her redesignation from "T-AO-151" (as an oiler) to "T-AO-151T" (as a transport oiler). By 1974 she was operating from United States Gulf Coast ports.
"Shoshone" was placed out of service at an unrecorded date, probably in the mid-1980s. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, also at an unrecorded date, and was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 1 October 1994 to be laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay at Benicia, California. 
In 2001 she was used as an experimental platform by MH Systems to demonstrate the American Underpressure System (AUPS); a pressurized gas system intended to stop or significantly decrease the amount of oil spillage from single and double-hulled tankers in the event of a hull rupture. Following the test, the "Shoshone" was returned to the Reserve Fleet in August 2001. Google Earth images from August 25, 2009 still show the "Shoshone" as being part of the Suisun Bay National Defense Reserve Fleet. ()
The "Shoshone" was cleared for disposal in March 2010 and is likely to be sold for scrapping in the near future.

Bean harvester

A bean harvester, also known as a bean thresher or bean combine, is a threshing machine which is used to harvest beans. It mainly consists of a pickup, several beaters, shakers, one or several fans, elevators, conveyor belts, a storage bin, and usually a spreader at the rear. Until recently, the only practical manufacturer of bean harvesters was The Bidwell Bean Thresher Company. 
Process.
The pickup lifts the beans, which are arranged into windrows by rakes and pullers, off the ground and onto the main conveyor belt which feeds them into the first beater, which has many metal teeth, turns high RPMs, and does a significant portion of the threshing. From there the process varies from machine to machine. Basically the beans go through a series of more beaters and shakers.

Black Pond Wildlife Management Area

Black Pond Wildlife Management Area is a New York State Wildlife Management Area (WMA) that lies on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario, and at the northern limit of an unusual region of sandy barrier beaches and lagoons. Much of the barrier beach in Black Pond WMA has forested sand dunes that are about high; these are the highest sand dunes in the northeast United States excepting Cape Cod. Immediately north of the WMA is the El Dorado Beach Preserve, which is a bird refuge owned by The Nature Conservancy; North of the outlet from Black Pond to Lake Ontario, the shoreline is a weathered, flat bedrock shelf that is "calcareous" instead of sandy.
From the parking lot at road's end, the WMA has an accessible trail and boardwalk that reaches through the interior wetlands to the sandy beach on Lake Ontario. From the terminus of the boardwalk, it is possible to walk south along the beach for about without getting wet feet. This beach route passes out of the WMA, past the beachfront residences of Jefferson Park, through Southwick Beach State Park, and into the sizable Lakeview Wildlife Management Area. Walking north along the beach leads onto the El Dorado Beach Preserve; a hiking trail and bird-watching blinds at the Beach Preserve are normally reached by Grandjean Road, which is north of Black Pond.
Black Pond WMA, with Lakeview WMA, Deer Creek Marsh WMA, and the Sandy Pond Beach Unique Area, comprise the Eastern Lake Ontario Marshes Bird Conservation Area. The Nature Conservancy's adjacent El Dorado Beach Preserve extends this bird conservation area. Black Pond WMA, Southwick Beach State Park, Lakeview WMA, Sandy Pond Beach Natural Area, and Deer Creek Marsh WMA have been included in a New York Natural Heritage Area, the "Eastern Lake Ontario Barrier Beach and Wetland Complex".
The WMA and the Beach Preserve are in the Town of Ellisburg in Jefferson County.

The Yunnan Institute of Development (YID), based in Yunnan Province's Yuxi Prefecture, is a Sino-Danish non-governmental organization, non-formal adult education institute established in 2001 in partnership with Yuxi Teacher College. The project co-ordinator is Elizabeth Axelsen.
Work.
It aims to promote social development in China, Africa and India.
Activities include educating people about health, hygiene and HIV, building schools and helping poor farmers with bio-gas and microfinance.
Participants are trained in 11-month courses as ‘Development Instructors’ (DI) interested in learning about and practicing development. Chinese and foreign participants can choose to conduct development work in Yunnan and then in Africa or India. There are no special qualifications needed to join the Development Instructor programme.
From 2008 the Institute is to also implement shorter courses for project managers. At YID, education is based on "learning by doing". The Institute is a place where the participant plans and implements their own education, where the teacher is a facilitator and where the participant is primarily responsible for their own exploratory learning. YID also runs a Rural Community Development Project called Child Aid, where the DI's receive practical training and actually live and work during their five month practical training period. YID works closely together with local authorities in the rural areas and in the city.
DRH movement.
YID is one of 13 schools worldwide which are part of the DRH Movement (DRH translates from Danish words to mean "The Travelling Folk High School"). YID provides training for volunteers who work in the "Humana People to People" programme. The volunteers work as teachers, and help to train farmers and to develop small businesses in Africa and China.

Capture of Nam Định (1883)

The Capture of Nam Định (27 March 1883), a confrontation between the French and the Vietnamese, was one of the early engagements of the Tonkin Campaign (1883–86). In a brief campaign in the last week of March 1883, Commandant Henri Rivière captured the citadel of Nam Định, the second-largest city in Tonkin, with a flotilla of gunboats and a battalion of marine infantry.
Rivière's seizure of Nam Định marked a significant escalation of French ambitions in Tonkin, and had important consequences. China began to covertly support the Vietnamese government in its opposition to French colonization. Chinese involvement in Tonkin ultimately resulted in the nine-month Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885).
Background.
French intervention in northern Vietnam was precipitated by Commandant Henri Rivière, who was sent with a small French military force to Hanoi at the end of 1881 to investigate Vietnamese complaints against the activities of French merchants. In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, Rivière stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882. Although Rivière subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force was greeted with alarm in both Vietnam and China. 
The Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivière with its own ramshackle army, enlisted the help of Liu Yongfu, whose well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers were to prove a thorn in the side of the French. The Vietnamese also bid for Chinese support. Vietnam had long been a vassal state of China, and China agreed to arm and support the Black Flags and to covertly oppose French operations in Tonkin. The Qing court also sent a strong signal to the French that China would not allow Tonkin to fall under French control. In the summer of 1882 troops of the Chinese Yunnan and Guangxi Armies crossed the border into Tonkin, occupying Lạng Sơn, Bắc Ninh, Hưng Hóa and other towns. The French minister to China, Frédéric Bourée, was so alarmed by the prospect of war with China that in November and December 1882 he negotiated a deal with the Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang to divide Tonkin into French and Chinese spheres of influence. Both negotiators were criticized for giving too much away, and the deal soon unravelled. It was never ratified in China, and in France Jules Ferry's incoming administration disavowed the agreement in March 1883 and recalled Bourée.
Occupation of Hon Gai.
In late February 1883, the French forces in Hanoi were reinforced by a 500-man battalion of marine infantry from France under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Carreau, which more than doubled the force at Rivière’s disposal, was a parting gift from the bellicose Admiral Bernard Jauréguiberry, who had been replaced as navy minister on 29 January. Carreau’s men sailed from France aboard the transport "Corrèze" and reached Hanoi on 24 February. The instructions that accompanied the reinforcements specified that they were not to be used to extend the French occupation of Tonkin. 
On 8 March, Rivière learned that the Annamese government was planning to lease the coal mines at Hon Gai, a coastal town near Haiphong, to a Chinese consortium which was really a front for a British company. If the British were allowed to install themselves at Hon Gai, France could bid farewell to its dreams of colonial expansion in Tonkin. In defiance of both the letter and the spirit of his instructions, Rivière immediately decided to take the initiative. On his orders, Commandant Berthe de Villers left the following day aboard "Parseval", raised the French tricolour in Hon Gai and established a post of 50 men there. The French met no resistance. 
In his report on this action to Charles Thomson, the governor of Cochinchina, Rivière explained that he had occupied Hon Gai primarily to secure his line of communications with Haiphong. But he did not hide the fact that he was also attempting to extend French control of Tonkin. With his friends, he was even franker. 'I have taken possession of the entire mining district,' he wrote. 'We have always coveted it, but have always hesitated to act. This will force them to take forward their Tonkin Question!'
The decision to attack Nam Dinh.
Rivière also believed that, in his present situation, doing nothing was more dangerous than taking the initiative. Alarming news was coming in from both the north and the south. At Son Tay, Liu Yongfu was preparing to attack the French in Hanoi with 5,000 men of the Black Flag Army. In the Delta, the governor of Nam Dinh had armed the citadel, and the French gunboats were having great difficulty in preventing him from blocking the canals. Rivière was convinced that France should strike first. Now, at last, he had the means to act. 'As this indecisive government has been imprudent enough to send me 500 men,' he wrote to a friend, 'I have decided to use them to do what it did not decide I should do.' 
Rivière decided to strike at Nam Dinh, again in order to secure his communications with the coast. It was the strategy that Francis Garnier had adopted in 1873, and it was probably the right one. But the decision aroused considerable opposition among his officers. They argued that it would result in a most undesirable division of the small French force at Hanoi. Nam Định would have to be garrisonned if it fell, and the French would then be too stretched to carry out further military operations. They recommended that the French should instead attack Liu Yongfu in Son Tay with all their available forces. Rivière was not convinced. He believed, probably rightly, that the French were not strong enough to take on Liu Yongfu. He overruled his officers and ordered plans to be prepared for an expedition against Nam Định. Eleven months after French troops had gone into action at Hanoi, Rivière once again threw down the gauntlet to the Vietnamese and Chinese courts.
Nam Dinh was defended by 6,200 Vietnamese soldiers under the command of the "tong doc" (governor) Vu Truong Binh, assisted by the "de doc" Le Van Diem and the "quan an" Ho Ba On. A contingent of 600 Chinese soldiers from the Chinese garrison of Bac Ninh also fought covertly on the Vietnamese side, led by the Black Flag officer Vinh Thong Chat. As France and China were not at war, the Chinese troops wore Black Flag uniforms to disguise their participation in the battle.
The Nam Dinh campaign.
"Chef de bataillon" Pierre de Badens (1847–97) made a reconnaissance of Nam Định on 11 March by boat, and reported that it had been put into a good state of defence and was garrisoned by an army of 8,000 to 10,000 men. Rivière nevertheless decided to attack the city, and assembled a flotilla of junks and steam-launches to transport four and a half marine infantry companies under Colonel Carreau's command and a detachment of Cochinchinese riflemen ("tirailleurs annamites")—520 men in all—down the Red River to Nam Dinh. This was a breathtakingly small attacking force, but it would be supported by several gunboats, whose firepower would enormously increase the chances of success. Rivière took personal command of the expedition, and his flotilla left Hanoi on 23 March, accompanied by the gunboats "Hache" and "Yatagan". Berthe de Villers was left to defend Hanoi with three and a half companies of infantry and the gunboat "Léopard". 
The expedition had first to run the gauntlet of the defences of Ninh Bình, whose citadel was built on a massive crag overlooking the Red River and was defended by a number of cannon which completely commanded the passage. The flotilla reached Ninh Bình on the afternoon of 24 March, to find the gunboat "Carabine" waiting. This was a critical moment. The garrison of the citadel stood to arms at the French approach, and according to Rivière 'their guns, if well handled, could have annihilated us'. However, the governor of Ninh Bình declined to open fire, being 'one of those Asiatics who do not normally concern themselves with the misfortunes of their colleagues unless they affect them personally'. The expedition passed Ninh Bình unharmed, and anchored that evening at the entrance to the Nam Định canal, where it was joined by the gunboats "Pluvier" and "Surprise". 
On the morning of 25 March, the flotilla anchored off the southern wall of the citadel of Nam Định, where the gunboat "Fanfare" was already in position. Rivière now had five gunboats at his disposal. In the early afternoon French marine infantry went ashore and occupied the Nam Định naval barracks, evacuated by the city's defenders, without resistance. Later in the afternoon sailors from "Fanfare" went ashore and burned a number of wooden huts to obtain a clear field of fire for the gunboat's artillery. Several Vietnamese cannon responded to this provocation by opening fire, with little effect, on the French gunboat. "Fanfare" replied, and dismounted four artillery pieces on the city's ramparts. The action died down by nightfall, and did not become general. While this exchange of fire was in progress Rivière summoned the city's governor Vu Truong Binh to present himself in person aboard "Pluvier" and to hand over the citadel before 8 a.m. on the following day. The governor's refusal arrived in the evening.
The bombardment of Nam Dinh.
The walls of Nam Định were fifteen feet thick and solidly reveted. They could not be scaled by the attackers, as they were protected by deep ditches filled with water. Knowing that it would be impossible to breach the walls with the small-calibre cannon of the French gunboats, Rivière decided to force an entrance into Nam Định by destroying one of the main gates with explosives. He nevertheless ordered a preliminary bombardment of the city's ramparts by the gunboats, hoping to dismount as many Vietnamese artillery pieces as possible before his infantry and engineers made their assault. On the evening of 25 March the gunboats deployed along the Nam Định canal into a long line opposite the southeast wall of the citadel, enabling them to bring the defenders under a punishing crossfire.
Rivière wanted to open fire as soon as the ultimatum expired, but it was so foggy on the morning of 26 March that action was impossible. However, the fog cleared in the early afternoon, and "Fanfare" moved up close to the southeast wall and began to bombard Nam Định's outer defences at 2 p.m., firing slowly and accurately to dismount the guns facing the canal. To keep the defenders under cover, both "Fanfare" and "Pluvier" engaged them with their Hotchkiss "canons-revolvers". After two hours, the fire from the southern defences slackened and "Fanfare" withdrew, having suffered only minor damage from two hits by enemy cannonballs. Many of the guns in the citadel had ignored the French gunboats, and fired instead on a nearby Roman Catholic mission.
The capture of Nam Định.
Rivière assaulted Nam Định the following day. He disembarked his force at 11 a.m., after a devastating five-hour bombardment of the citadel by the gunboats. The attack force numbered just under 600 men, as Rivière supported the marine infantry and Cochinchinese riflemen with the landing companies of the gunboats "Pluvier" and "Fanfare". The troops went ashore in a suburb beyond the city's outer walls and were able to advance under cover of the buildings until they reached the main defences. In accordance with Rivière's plan, "capitaine du génie" Dupommier used dynamite charges to blow in the gate of the eastern demilune, then the eastern gate of the citadel. Dupommier and his party of engineers came under heavy fire from the Vietnamese defenders as they advanced to lay their charges, and had to fall back and wait for covering fire before making a second attempt. Once both gates had been blown in, the French charged into the citadel. Rivière led from the front, urging on his troops as they fought their way into the city and setting an example of personal courage. The Vietnamese resisted fiercely, but were overwhelmed by the superior firepower and morale of the French. By late afternoon the city was in French hands and its governor in flight. Sailors from "Fanfare" and "Pluvier" reached the summit of the citadel together. Unable to agree on who was first to the top, they hauled down the Annamese flag and hoisted two French flags in its place. 
A large Vietnamese force outside the city attempted to attack the French gunboats in the early evening, but was shelled in the open and quickly dispersed. 
French casualties in this operation were remarkably light: only four men wounded. However, one of the casualties was Lieutenant-Colonel Carreau, the commander of the expeditionary battalion, whose foot was smashed by a cannonball. His leg was later amputated, but his condition worsened and he died on 13 May. Vietnamese casualties are not known, but according to Rivière the defenders fought with unusual stubbornness, and when the French entered the city they found its walls piled with corpses.
Aftermath.
The French found 98 cannon in the citadel of Nam Định, including five 30-millimetre rifled French guns ceded under the 1874 treaty. As the citadel was smaller than Hanoi’s and remained defensible despite the bombardment it had just suffered, Rivière decided to occupy it. He appointed "chef de bataillon" Badens "commandant supérieur" of Nam Định, giving him a garrison of 440 men and two gunboats. Badens quickly restored order in the town and reconstituted its municipal government, appointing new magistrates on the advice of the head of the local Catholic mission. By 31 March, when Rivière returned to Hanoi, the shops had reopened and many of the inhabitants had returned.
Rivière praised the conduct of the marine infantry who had made the assault, some of whom had also taken part in the capture of Hanoi citadel on 25 April 1882, in the following order of the day:
Vous venez de montrer, à la prise de la citadelle de Nam-Dinh, le même entrain, la même valeur, le même dévouement qu’à la prise de la citadelle d’Hanoï. Je vous confonds les uns et les autres, les anciens comme les nouveaux, dans cet éloge, que notre brave colonel blessé à votre tête vous décerne comme moi. La Patrie, qui vous suit de cœur dans les pays lointains où nous sommes, tressaillera bientôt d’émotion et d’orgueil en apprenant ce que vous avez fait. Vive la France!
(You have just shown, at the capture of the citadel of Nam Dinh, the same enthusiasm, the same valour and the same devotion as at the capture of the citadel of Hanoi. I congratulate you all, making no distinction between those there then and those here now, between old hands and newcomers; and our brave colonel who was wounded at your head sees you as I do. Our country, whose heart has followed you into these far-off regions, will soon thrill with emotion and pride when it learns what you have done. Long live France!)

Bernard Mate

Bernard Mate (b. 1922– 6 January 1994)was a Kenyan politician and one of the first group of Africans to be elected to Legco, the then legislative arm of government in the British Colony of Kenya, representing what was the black constituency of Kenya. He served three terms in Kenya's Parliament finally losing in 1979. He died on 6 January 1994, after a short illness. As a politician he was part of KADU's delegation to Kenya's Lancaster House Constitutional conferences. He was described by Oginga Odinga as a being a philosopher in Odinga's autobiography" Not Yet Uhuru"
Early Childhood.
Bernard Mate was born to M'Thura wa Rware and Ruth Igoji, who hailed from Mutuguni (near Nturiri). He was their fourth born child and the first to survive childhood.
Education.
Bernard Mate enrolled in Ndiruini (now Kiereni) Primary School for his early primary education and sat his K.A.P.E and Chogoria Junior School. He entered Alliance High School in 1939, graduating in 1945 to pursue a diploma in teaching at Makerere University. He spent 4 years teaching at Chogoria High school, before enrolling for a Bachelor of Arts degree in the University of North Wales Bangor. He then pursued a postgraduate diploma at the University of Edinburgh, before returning to Kenya to continue his career as a teacher.
Teaching career.
Bernard Mate returned to Kenya in 1954 and taught at the Alliance Girls High School, for one year, before being transferred to the Government Teachers Training College Meru (now Meru Teacher's Training College) before venturing into elective politics in 1957, when Africans were first allowed to elect their own representatives to the then LegCo. from 1957 to 1974, he taught at the Kilimambogo Teachers Training College, and was the founding headmaster of Ikuu High School.
Political career.
Mate entered elective politics in 1957, winning the CentralKenya seat for the Legco, in an election which he ran against former nominated MP Eliud Mathu as well as such politicians as Jeremiah Nyagah, David Waruhiu, and Stephen Kioni.He won fifty one percent of the vote ahead of Elliud Mathu (30 percent) and Nyagah (12 percent). At the time this constituency was composed of the current Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyeri, Laikipia Kiambu and Murang'a Counties. During this term, he served in then minority KADU government of Ronald Ngala in various capacities from Minister of Health, Education and Social Services. He is credited with participating in the abolition of the discriminative Common Entrance Exam (CEE), and the establishment of Kaguru Farmers Training Centre during this time. He lost his seat parliamentary seat contesting what was then Meru Central Constituency (since split into North Imenti Constituency, Central Imenti Constituency and South Imenti Constituency) in the 1963 elections that elected Kenya's independence government. He recaptured the Meru Central seat in a 1965 by-election. He would lose the seat in the 1969 general election, and then moved to Meru South to serve one final term in the general election of 1974. He was an avid debater and a political philosopher. The Ena-Ishiara-Ciakariga-Tunyai-Meru road is named after this gallant son of Kenya
Family.
Bernard Mate was married to Edith Gatakaa and with her had eight children. Four daughters: Anne Keeru, Amy Kagendo, Ivy Kathanje, and Alice Kanyua and three sons: Arthur Njage, Munene Mate, Nelson Njeru.

Mechanics of planar particle motion

This article describes a particle in planar motion when observed from non-inertial reference frames. The most famous examples of planar motion are related to the motion of two spheres that are gravitationally attracted to one another, and the generalization of this problem to planetary motion. See centrifugal force, two-body problem, orbit and Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Those problems fall in the general field of analytical dynamics, the determination of orbits from given laws of force. This article is focused more on the kinematical issues surrounding planar motion, that is, determination of the forces necessary to result in a certain trajectory "given" the particle trajectory. 
General results presented in fictitious forces here are applied to observations of a moving particle as seen from several specific non-inertial frames, for example, a "local" frame (one tied to the moving particle so it appears stationary), and a "co-rotating" frame (one with an arbitrarily located but fixed axis and a rate of rotation that makes the particle appear to have only radial motion and zero azimuthal motion). The Lagrangian approach to fictitious forces is introduced.
Unlike real forces such as electromagnetic forces, fictitious forces do not originate from physical interactions between objects.
Analysis using fictitious forces.
The appearance of fictitious forces normally is associated with use of a non-inertial frame of reference, and their absence with use of an inertial frame of reference. The connection between inertial frames and fictitious forces (also called "inertial forces" or "pseudo-forces"), is expressed, for example, by Arnol'd:
A slightly different tack on the subject is provided by Iro:
Fictitious forces do not appear in the equations of motion in an inertial frame of reference: in an inertial frame, the motion of an object is explained by the real impressed forces. In a non-inertial frame such as a rotating frame, however, Newton's first and second laws still can be used to make accurate physical predictions provided fictitious forces are included along with the real forces. For solving problems of mechanics in non-inertial reference frames, the advice given in textbooks is to treat the fictitious forces like real forces and to pretend you are in an inertial frame.
It should be mentioned that "treating the fictitious forces like real forces" means, in particular, that fictitious forces as seen in a particular non-inertial frame transform as "vectors" under coordinate transformations made within that frame, that is, like real forces.
Moving objects and observational frames of reference.
Next, it is observed that time varying coordinates are used in both inertial and non-inertial frames of reference, so the use of time varying coordinates should not be confounded with a change of observer, but is only a change of the observer's choice of description. Elaboration of this point and some citations on the subject follow.
Frame of reference and coordinate system.
The term frame of reference is used often in a very broad sense, but for the present discussion its meaning is restricted to refer to an observer's "state of motion", that is, to either an inertial frame of reference or a non-inertial frame of reference.
The term coordinate system is used to differentiate between different possible choices for a set of variables to describe motion, choices available to any observer, regardless of their state of motion. Examples are Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates and (more generally) curvilinear coordinates.
Here are two quotes relating "state of motion" and "coordinate system":
Time varying coordinate systems.
In a general coordinate system, the basis vectors for the coordinates may vary in time at fixed positions, or they may vary with position at fixed times, or both. It may be noted that coordinate systems attached to both inertial frames and non-inertial frames can have basis vectors that vary in time, space or both, for example the description of a trajectory in polar coordinates as seen from an inertial frame. or as seen from a rotating frame. A time-dependent "description" of observations does not change the frame of reference in which the observations are made and recorded.
Fictitious forces in a local coordinate system.
In discussion of a particle moving in a circular orbit, in an inertial frame of reference one can identify the centripetal and tangential forces. It then seems to be no problem to switch hats, change perspective, and talk about the fictitious forces commonly called the centrifugal and Euler force. But what underlies this switch in vocabulary is a change of observational frame of reference from the inertial frame where we started, where centripetal and tangential forces make sense, to a rotating frame of reference where the particle appears motionless and fictitious centrifugal and Euler forces have to be brought into play. That switch is unconscious, but real.
Suppose we sit on a particle in general planar motion (not just a circular orbit). What analysis underlies a switch of hats to introduce fictitious centrifugal and Euler forces?
To explore that question, begin in an inertial frame of reference. By using a coordinate system commonly used in planar motion, the so-called "local" coordinate system, as shown in Figure 1, it becomes easy to identify formulas for the centripetal inward force normal to the trajectory (in direction opposite to un in Figure 1), and the tangential force parallel to the trajectory (in direction ut), as shown next.
To introduce the unit vectors of the local coordinate system shown in Figure 1, one approach is to begin in Cartesian coordinates in an inertial framework and describe the local coordinates in terms of these Cartesian coordinates. In Figure 1, the arc length "s" is the distance the particle has traveled along its path in time "t". The path r ("t") with components "x"("t"), "y"("t") in Cartesian coordinates is described using arc length "s"("t") as:
One way to look at the use of "s" is to think of the path of the particle as sitting in space, like the trail left by a skywriter, independent of time. Any position on this path is described by stating its distance "s" from some starting point on the path. Then an incremental displacement along the path "ds" is described by:
where primes are introduced to denote derivatives with respect to "s". The magnitude of this displacement is "ds", showing that:
This displacement is necessarily tangent to the curve at "s", showing that the unit vector tangent to the curve is:
while the outward unit vector normal to the curve is 
Orthogonality can be verified by showing the vector dot product is zero. The unit magnitude of these vectors is a consequence of Eq. 1.
As an aside, notice that the use of unit vectors that are not aligned along the Cartesian "xy"-axes does not mean we are no longer in an inertial frame. All it means is that we are using unit vectors that vary with "s" to describe the path, but still observe the motion from the inertial frame.
Using the tangent vector, the angle of the tangent to the curve, say θ, is given by:
The radius of curvature is introduced completely formally (without need for geometric interpretation) as:
The derivative of θ can be found from that for sin θ:
Now:
in which the denominator is unity according to Eq. 1. With this formula for the derivative of the sine, the radius of curvature becomes:
where the equivalence of the forms stems from differentiation of Eq. 1:
Having set up the description of any position on the path in terms of its associated value for "s", and having found the properties of the path in terms of this description, motion of the particle is introduced by stating the particle position at any time "t" as the corresponding value "s (t)".
Using the above results for the path properties in terms of "s", the acceleration in the inertial reference frame as described in terms of the components normal and tangential to the path of the particle can be found in terms of the function "s"("t") and its various time derivatives (as before, "primes" indicate differentiation with respect to "s"):
as can be verified by taking the dot product with the unit vectors ut("s") and un("s"). This result for acceleration is the same as that for circular motion based on the radius ρ. Using this coordinate system in the inertial frame, it is easy to identify the force normal to the trajectory as the centripetal force and that parallel to the trajectory as the tangential force.
Next, we change observational frames. Sitting on the particle, we adopt a non-inertial frame where the particle is at rest (zero velocity). This frame has a continuously changing origin, which at time "t" is the center of curvature (the center of the osculating circle in Figure 1) of the path at time "t", and whose rate of rotation is the angular rate of motion of the particle about that origin at time "t". This non-inertial frame also employs unit vectors normal to the trajectory and parallel to it.
The angular velocity of this frame is the angular velocity of the particle about the center of curvature at time "t". The centripetal force of the inertial frame is interpreted in the non-inertial frame where the body is at rest as a force necessary to overcome the centrifugal force. Likewise, the force causing any acceleration of speed along the path seen in the inertial frame becomes the force necessary to overcome the Euler force in the non-inertial frame where the particle is at rest. There is zero Coriolis force in the frame, because the particle has zero velocity in this frame. For a pilot in an airplane, for example, these fictitious forces are a matter of direct experience. However, these fictitious forces cannot be related to a simple observational frame of reference other than the particle itself, unless it is in a particularly simple path, like a circle.
That said, from a qualitative standpoint, the path of an airplane can be approximated by an arc of a circle for a limited time, and for the limited time a particular radius of curvature applies, the centrifugal and Euler forces can be analyzed on the basis of circular motion with that radius. See article discussing turning an airplane.
Next, reference frames rotating about a fixed axis are discussed in more detail.
Fictitious forces in polar coordinates.
Description of particle motion often is simpler in non-Cartesian coordinate systems, for example, polar coordinates. When equations of motion are expressed in terms of any curvilinear coordinate system, extra terms appear that represent how the basis vectors change as the coordinates change. These terms arise automatically on transformation to polar (or cylindrical) coordinates and are thus not fictitious "forces", but rather are simply added "terms" in the acceleration in polar coordinates.
Two terminologies.
In a purely mathematical treatment, regardless of the frame that the coordinate system is associated with (inertial or non-inertial), extra terms appear in the acceleration of an observed particle when using curvilinear coordinates. For example, in polar coordinates the acceleration is given by (see below for details):
which contains not just double time derivatives of the coordinates but added terms. This example employs polar coordinates, but more generally the added terms depend upon which coordinate system is chosen (that is, polar, elliptic, or whatever).
Sometimes these coordinate-system dependent "terms" also are referred to as "fictitious forces", introducing a second meaning for "fictitious forces", despite the fact that these terms do not have the vector transformation properties expected of forces. For example, see Shankar and Hildebrand. According to this terminology, fictitious forces are determined in part by the coordinate system itself, regardless of the frame it is attached to, that is, regardless of whether the coordinate system is attached to an inertial or a non-inertial frame of reference. In contrast, the fictitious forces defined in terms of the "state of motion of the observer" vanish in inertial frames of reference. To distinguish these two terminologies, the fictitious forces that vanish in an inertial frame of reference, the inertial forces of Newtonian mechanics, are called in this article the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces and those that originate in the interpretation of time derivatives in particular coordinate systems are called "coordinate" fictitious forces.
Assuming it is clear that "state of motion" and "coordinate system" are "different", it follows that the dependence of centrifugal force (as in this article) upon "state of motion" and its independence from "coordinate system", which contrasts with the "coordinate" version with exactly the opposite dependencies, indicates that two different ideas are referred to by the terminology "fictitious force". The present article emphasizes one of these two ideas ("state-of-motion"), although the other also is described.
Below, polar coordinates are introduced for use in (first) an inertial frame of reference and then (second) in a rotating frame of reference. The two different uses of the term "fictitious force" are pointed out. First, however, follows a brief digression to explain further how the "coordinate" terminology for fictitious force has arisen.
Lagrangian approach.
To motivate the introduction of "coordinate" inertial forces by more than a reference to "mathematical convenience", what follows is a digression to show these forces correspond to what are called by some authors "generalized" fictitious forces or "generalized inertia forces". These forces are introduced via the Lagrangian mechanics approach to mechanics based upon describing a system by "generalized coordinates" usually denoted as {"qk"}. The only requirement on these coordinates is that they are necessary and sufficient to uniquely characterize the state of the system: they need not be (although they could be) the coordinates of the particles in the system. Instead, they could be the angles and extensions of links in a robot arm, for instance. If a mechanical system consists of "N" particles and there are "m" independent kinematical conditions imposed, it is possible to characterize the system uniquely by "n" = 3"N - m" independent generalized coordinates {"qk"}.
In classical mechanics, the Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy, formula_21, of the system minus its potential energy, formula_22. In symbols,
Under conditions that are given in Lagrangian mechanics, if the Lagrangian of a system is known, then the equations of motion of the system may be obtained by a direct substitution of the expression for the Lagrangian into the Euler–Lagrange equation, a particular family of partial differential equations.
Here are some definitions:
It is not the purpose here to outline how Lagrangian mechanics works. The interested reader can look at other articles explaining this approach. For the moment, the goal is simply to show that the Lagrangian approach can lead to "generalized fictitious forces" that "do not vanish in inertial frames". What is pertinent here is that in the case of a single particle, the Lagrangian approach can be arranged to capture exactly the "coordinate" fictitious forces just introduced.
To proceed, consider a single particle, and introduce the generalized coordinates as {"qk"} = ("r, θ"). Then Hildebrand shows in polar coordinates with the "qk" = "(r, θ)" the "generalized momenta" are:
leading, for example, to the generalized force:
with "Qr" the impressed radial force. The connection between "generalized forces" and Newtonian forces varies with the choice of coordinates. This Lagrangian formulation introduces exactly the "coordinate" form of fictitious forces mentioned above that allows "fictitious" (generalized) forces in inertial frames, for example, the term formula_31 Careful reading of Hildebrand shows he doesn't discuss the role of "inertial frames of reference", and in fact, says "presence or absence [of inertia forces depends, not upon the particular problem at hand but "upon the coordinate system chosen"." By coordinate system presumably is meant the choice of {"qk"}. Later he says "If "accelerations" associated with generalized coordinates are to be of prime interest (as is usually the case), the terms may be conveniently transferred to the right … and considered as additional (generalized) inertia forces. Such inertia forces are often said to be of the "Coriolis" type."
In short, the emphasis of some authors upon coordinates and their derivatives and their introduction of (generalized) fictitious forces that do not vanish in inertial frames of reference is an outgrowth of the use of generalized coordinates in Lagrangian mechanics. For example, see McQuarrie Hildebrand, and von Schwerin. Below is an example of this usage as employed in the design of robotic manipulators:
For a robot manipulator, the equations may be written in a form using Christoffel symbols "Γijk" (discussed further below) as:
where "M" is the "manipulator inertia matrix" and "V" is the potential energy due to gravity (for example), and formula_33 are the generalized forces on joint "i". The terms involving Christoffel symbols therefore determine the "generalized centrifugal" and "generalized Coriolis" terms.
The introduction of "generalized" fictitious forces often is done without notification and without specifying the word "generalized". This sloppy use of terminology leads to endless confusion because these "generalized" fictitious forces, unlike the standard "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, do not vanish in inertial frames of reference.
Polar coordinates in an inertial frame of reference.
Below, the acceleration of a particle is derived as seen in an inertial frame using polar coordinates. There are no "state-of-motion" fictitious forces in an inertial frame, by definition. Following that presentation, the contrasting terminology of "coordinate" fictitious forces is presented and critiqued on the basis of the non-vectorial transformation behavior of these "forces".
In an inertial frame, let formula_34 be the position vector of a moving particle. Its Cartesian components ("x", "y") are:
with polar coordinates "r" and θ depending on time "t".
Unit vectors are defined in the radially outward direction formula_34: 
and in the direction at right angles to formula_34:
These unit vectors vary in direction with time:
and:
Using these derivatives, the first and second derivatives of position are:
where dot-overmarkings indicate time differentiation. With this form for the acceleration formula_44, in an inertial frame of reference Newton's second law expressed in polar coordinates is:
where "F" is the net real force on the particle. No fictitious forces appear because all fictitious forces are zero by definition in an inertial frame.
From a mathematical standpoint, however, it sometimes is handy to put only the second-order derivatives on the right side of this equation; that is we write the above equation by rearrangement of terms as:
where a "coordinate" version of the "acceleration" is introduced:
consisting of only second-order time derivatives of the coordinates "r" and θ. The terms moved to the force-side of the equation are now treated as "extra" "fictitious forces" and, confusingly, the resulting forces also are called the "centrifugal" and "Coriolis" force.
These newly defined "forces" are non-zero in an "inertial frame", and so certainly are not the same as the previously identified fictitious forces that are zero in an inertial frame and non-zero only in a non-inertial frame. In this article, these newly defined forces are called the "coordinate" centrifugal force and the "coordinate" Coriolis force to separate them from the "state-of-motion" forces.
Change of origin.
Here is an illustration showing the so-called "centrifugal term" formula_48 does not transform as a true force, putting any reference to this term not just as a "term", but as a centrifugal "force", in a dubious light. Suppose in frame "S" a particle moves radially away from the origin at a constant velocity. See Figure 2. The force on the particle is zero by Newton's first law. Now we look at the same thing from frame "S' ", which is the same, but displaced in origin. In "S' " the particle still is in straight line motion at constant speed, so again the force is zero.
What if we use polar coordinates in the two frames? In frame "S" the radial motion is constant and there is no angular motion. Hence, the acceleration is:
and each term individually is zero because formula_50 and formula_51. There is no force, including no formula_48 "force" in frame "S".
In frame "S' ", however, we have:
In this case the azimuthal term is zero, being the rate of change of angular momentum. To obtain zero acceleration in the radial direction, however, we require:
The right-hand side is non-zero, inasmuch as neither formula_55 nor formula_56 is zero. That is, we cannot obtain zero force (zero formula_57) if we retain only formula_58 as the acceleration; we need both terms.
Despite the above facts, suppose we adopt polar coordinates, and wish to say that formula_48 is "centrifugal force", and reinterpret formula_60 as "acceleration" (without dwelling upon any possible justification). How does this decision fare when we consider that a proper formulation of physics is geometry and coordinate-independent? See the article on general covariance. To attempt to form a covariant expression, this so-called centrifugal "force" can be put into vector notation as:
with:
and formula_63 a unit vector normal to the plane of motion. Unfortunately, although this expression formally looks like a vector, when an observer changes origin the value of formula_64 changes (see Figure 2), so observers in the same frame of reference standing on different street corners see different "forces" even though the actual events they witness are identical.
How can a physical force (be it fictitious or real) be zero in one frame "S", but non-zero in another frame "S' " identical, but a few feet away? Even for exactly the same particle behavior the expression formula_48 is different in every frame of reference, even for very trivial distinctions between frames. In short, if we take formula_48 as "centrifugal force", it does not have a universal significance: it is "unphysical".
Beyond this problem, the real impressed net force is zero. (There is no real impressed force in straight-line motion at constant speed). If we adopt polar coordinates, and wish to say that formula_48 is "centrifugal force", and reinterpret formula_60 as "acceleration", the oddity results in frame "S' " that straight-line motion at constant speed requires a net force in polar coordinates, but not in Cartesian coordinates. Moreover, this perplexity applies in frame "S", but not in frame "S".
The absurdity of the behavior of formula_48 indicates that one must say that formula_48 is "not" centrifugal "force", but simply one of two "terms" in the acceleration. This view, that the acceleration is composed of two terms, is frame-independent: there is zero centrifugal force in any and every inertial frame. It also is coordinate-system independent: we can use Cartesian, polar, or any other curvilinear system: they all produce zero.
Apart from the above physical arguments, of course, the derivation above, based upon application of the mathematical rules of differentiation, shows the radial acceleration does indeed consist of the two terms formula_71.
That said, the next subsection shows there is a connection between these centrifugal and Coriolis "terms" and the fictitious "forces" that pertain to a particular "rotating" frame of reference (as distinct from an inertial frame).
Co-rotating frame.
In the case of planar motion of a particle, the "coordinate" centrifugal and Coriolis acceleration terms found above to be non-zero in an inertial frame can be shown to be the negatives of the "state-of-motion" centrifugal and Coriolis terms that appear in a very particular non-inertial "co-rotating" frame (see next subsection). See Figure 3. To define a co-rotating frame, first an origin is selected from which the distance "r(t)" to the particle is defined. An axis of rotation is set up that is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the particle, and passing through this origin. Then, at the selected moment "t", the rate of rotation of the co-rotating frame Ω is made to match the rate of rotation of the particle about this axis, "dθ/dt". The co-rotating frame applies only for a moment, and must be continuously re-selected as the particle moves. For more detail, see Polar coordinates, centrifugal and Coriolis terms.
Polar coordinates in a rotating frame of reference.
Next, the same approach is used to find the fictitious forces of a (non-inertial) rotating frame. For example, if a rotating polar coordinate system is adopted for use in a rotating frame of observation, both rotating at the same constant counterclockwise rate Ω, we find the equations of motion in this frame as follows: the radial coordinate in the rotating frame is taken as "r", but the angle θ' in the rotating frame changes with time:
Consequently,
Plugging this result into the acceleration using the unit vectors of the previous section:
The leading two terms are the same form as those in the inertial frame, and they are the only terms if the frame is "not" rotating, that is, if Ω=0. However, in this rotating frame we have the extra terms:
The radial term Ω2 "r" is the centrifugal force per unit mass due to the system's rotation at rate Ω and the radial term formula_77 is the radial component of the Coriolis force per unit mass, where formula_78 is the tangential component of the particle velocity as seen in the rotating frame. The term formula_79 is the so-called "azimuthal" component of the Coriolis force per unit mass. In fact, these extra terms can be used to "measure" Ω and provide a test to see whether or not the frame is rotating, just as explained in the example of rotating identical spheres. If the particle's motion can be described by the observer using Newton's laws of motion "without" these Ω-dependent terms, the observer is in an inertial frame of reference where Ω=0.
These "extra terms" in the acceleration of the particle are the "state of motion" fictitious forces for this rotating frame, the forces introduced by rotation of the frame at angular rate Ω.
In this rotating frame, what are the "coordinate" fictitious forces? As before, suppose we choose to put only the second-order time derivatives on the right side of Newton's law:
If we choose for convenience to treat formula_83 as some so-called "acceleration", then the terms formula_84 are added to the so-called "fictitious force", which are not "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, but are actually components of force that persist even when Ω=0, that is, they persist even in an inertial frame of reference. Because these extra terms are added, the "coordinate" fictitious force is not the same as the "state-of-motion" fictitious force. Because of these extra terms, the "coordinate" fictitious force is not zero even in an inertial frame of reference.
More on the co-rotating frame.
Notice however, the case of a rotating frame that happens to have the same angular rate as the particle, so that Ω = "dθ/dt" at some particular moment (that is, the polar coordinates are set up in the instantaneous, non-inertial co-rotating frame of Figure 3). In this case, at this moment, "dθ'/dt = 0". In this co-rotating non-inertial frame at this moment the "coordinate" fictitious forces are only those due to the motion of the frame, that is, they are the same as the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, as discussed in the remarks about the co-rotating frame of Figure 3 in the previous section.
Fictitious forces in curvilinear coordinates.
To quote Bullo and Lewis: "Only in exceptional circumstances can the configuration of Lagrangian system be described by a vector in a vector space. In the natural mathematical setting, the system's configuration space is described loosely as a curved space, or more accurately as a differentiable manifold."
Instead of Cartesian coordinates, when equations of motion are expressed in a curvilinear coordinate system, Christoffel symbols appear in the acceleration of a particle expressed in this coordinate system, as described below in more detail. Consider description of a particle motion from the viewpoint of an "inertial frame of reference" in curvilinear coordinates. Suppose the position of a point "P" in Cartesian coordinates is ("x", "y", "z") and in curvilinear coordinates is ("q1", "q2". "q3"). Then functions exist that relate these descriptions:
and so forth. (The number of dimensions may be larger than three.) An important aspect of such coordinate systems is the element of arc length that allows distances to be determined. If the curvilinear coordinates form an orthogonal coordinate system, the element of arc length "ds" is expressed as:
where the quantities "hk" are called "scale factors". A change "dqk" in "qk" causes a displacement "hk dqk" along the coordinate line for "qk". At a point "P", we place unit vectors ek each tangent to a coordinate line of a variable "qk". Then any vector can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors, for example, from an inertial frame of reference, the position vector of a moving particle r located at time "t" at position "P" becomes:
where "qk" is the vector dot product of r and ek.
The velocity v of a particle at "P", can be expressed at "P" as:
where "vk" is the vector dot product of v and ek, and over dots indicate time differentiation.
The time derivatives of the basis vectors can be expressed in terms of the scale factors introduced above. for example:
in which the coefficients of the unit vectors are the Christoffel symbols for the coordinate system. The general notation and formulas for the Christoffel symbols are:
which allows all the time derivatives to be evaluated. For example, for the velocity:
with the Γ-notation for the Christoffel symbols replacing the curly bracket notation.
Using the same approach, the acceleration is then
Looking at the relation for acceleration, the first summation contains the time derivatives of velocity, which would be associated with acceleration if these were Cartesian coordinates, and the second summation (the one with Christoffel symbols) contains terms related to the way the unit vectors change with time.
"State-of-motion" versus "coordinate" fictitious forces.
Earlier in this article a distinction was introduced between two terminologies, the fictitious forces that vanish in an inertial frame of reference are called in this article the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces and those that originate from differentiation in a particular coordinate system are called "coordinate" fictitious forces. Using the expression for the acceleration above, Newton's law of motion in the inertial frame of reference becomes:
where "F" is the net real force on the particle. No "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are present because the frame is inertial, and "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are zero in an inertial frame, by definition.
The "coordinate" approach to Newton's law above is to retain the second-order time derivatives of the coordinates {"qk"} as the only terms on the right side of this equation, motivated more by mathematical convenience than by physics. To that end, the force law can be rewritten, taking the second summation to the force-side of the equation as:
with the convention that the "acceleration" formula_105 is now:
In the expression above, the summation added to the force-side of the equation now is treated as if added "forces" were present. These summation terms are customarily called fictitious forces within this "coordinate" approach, although in this inertial frame of reference all "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are identically zero. Moreover, these "forces" do not transform under coordinate transformations as "vectors". Thus, the designation of the terms of the summation as "fictitious forces" uses this terminology for contributions that are completely different from any real force, and from the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces. What adds to this confusion is that these "coordinate" fictitious forces are divided into two groups and given the "same names" as the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces, that is, they are divided into "centrifugal" and "Coriolis" terms, despite their inclusion of terms that are not the "state-of-motion" centrifugal and Coriolis terms. For example, these "coordinate" centrifugal and Coriolis terms can be nonzero "even in an inertial frame of reference" where the "state-of-motion" centrifugal force (the subject of this article) and Coriolis force always are zero.
If the frame is not inertial, for example, in a rotating frame of reference, the "state-of-motion" fictitious forces are included in the above "coordinate" fictitious force expression. Also, if the "acceleration" expressed in terms of first-order time derivatives of the velocity happens to result in terms that are "not" simply second-order derivatives of the coordinates {"qk"} in time, then these terms that are not second-order also are brought to the force-side of the equation and included with the fictitious forces. From the standpoint of a Lagrangian formulation, they can be called "generalized" fictitious forces. See Hildebrand, for example.
Formulation of dynamics in terms of Christoffel symbols and the "coordinate" version of fictitious forces is used often in the design of robots in connection with a Lagrangian formulation of the equations of motion.

Robert Muir (pathologist)

Sir Robert Muir, FRS, FRSE, FRCP, FRCPE, RFPSG (5 July 1864, Balfron, Stirlingshire – 30 March 1959, Edinburgh) was a Scottish physician and pathologist who carried out pioneering work in immunology, and was one of the leading figures in medical research in Glasgow in the early 20th century.
The son of a United Presbyterian minister (who died when Muir was 18), he studied at the University of Edinburgh, where he obtained an MA degree in 1884 and an MB CM degree with first-class honours in 1888. Subsequently he qualified as a medical practitioner by receiving his MD degree in 1890.
Muir was a lecturer in bacterial pathology at Edinburgh University (1894–98), and was briefly a professor in pathology at St Andrews University (Dundee) (1898–99). He spent most of his career as Professor of Pathology at Glasgow University (1899–1936), where he became recognised as one of the world's leading authorities in pathology, especially blood cell disorders and breast cancer. He was made LLD (Doctor of Laws) in 1937, and then served as Dean of Faculties from 1946 to 1949.
His publications included an early collection of papers on immunology, "Studies in Immunity" (1909, London, Oxford University Press), followed by "Text-book of Pathology" (1924). The latter, originally published by Edward Arnold, became a standard textbook in the field of pathology, and by 2008, under the imprint of Hodder Arnold Publication, it had reached a 14th edition, known as "Muir's Textbook of Pathology".
Muir was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1911, and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1916. He was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine and of the Pathological Society. He was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1929 (""For his contributions to the science of immunology""). He received many honorary degrees, including the D.Sc. in 1934. He was awarded the Lister Medal in 1936 for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Memorial Lecture, titled 'Malignancy with illustrations from the pathology of the mamma', was published later that year. In later life, he served in several positions in the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was on the Council from 1944–1947, and was Vice-President from 1950–1953.
During World War I he served as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, overseeing pathological and bacteriological work at Scottish hospitals. He was also Inspector of Laboratories in Scotland. Muir was knighted in 1934. He died in 1959, at the age of 94.

John Mallet

John William Mallet FRS (10 October 1832 – 7 November 1912) was an Irish chemist who lived and worked in the United States.
Biography.
John William Mallet was born near Dublin to Robert Mallet and Cordelia Mallet (Watson). Robert Mallet was a civil engineer and a fellow of the Royal Society and other societies and had an ample scientific library which his son had explored. Before entering college, John was attending private lessons in chemistry and at the age of 17 was admitted to Trinity College Dublin, where he obtained the degree of bachelor in arts in 1853. During the college years, he assisted his father in seismological studies, received gold medal in experimental physics, and published a paper on "Chemical examination of killinite" in 1849, just after entering college. In the summers of 1851 and 1852 he went to the University of Göttingen where he attended the lectures of Friedrich Wöhler and received a degree in 1852. He presented the associated thesis on the chemical composition of Celtic antiquities to the museum of the Royal Irish Academy.
After returning to Ireland and completing his college courses, Mallet went to the United States for the purpose of acquiring information for his father. He resided there for the rest of his life, but never became an American citizen. In 1854, he was appointed professor of analytical chemistry at Amherst, where a Göttingen friend William S. Clark held a leading position, but in January 1855 moved to the State Geological Survey of Alabama and became professor of chemistry at the University of Alabama. He served in that capacity, with a brief leave of absence spent at Mobile, until the American Civil War. In the autumn of 1861 he enlisted as a private in a troop of Confederate Cavalry, but almost immediately was chosen as aide-de-camp on the staff of General Robert E. Rodes. He
was transferred to the artillery in May 1862 and by 1865 became lieutenant colonel and then superintendent of the ordnance laboratories of the Southern States.
After peace had been established Mallet became professor of chemistry in the medical department of the University of Louisiana. The appointment was the outcome of a mission which he undertook,
on behalf of some Northern financiers, to search for petroleum in this southern state. The result of the appointment was to direct his attention to medicine, in which he gained the degree of Doctor in 1868. In that year he was called to the University of Virginia, which became his final home. At first his work included analytical, industrial and agricultural chemistry,
but, as time progressed, his scope became broader and broader. He lectured at Johns Hopkins University in 1877 and again in 1878, and during the winter of 1883–84 was professor of chemistry and physics, and chairman of the faculty in the University of Texas. The following year found him at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia as professor of chemistry, but the unsatisfactory conditions there caused him to return in 1885 to the University of Virginia, which he never again left. In 1908 he was appointed professor emeritus at the age of seventy-six, but still kept his residence at Charlottesville. Besides his services to the Southern States during the war, he undertook a number of other commissions of a public or semipublic nature, having served as judge in the bureau of awards at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and been a member of the United States Assay Commission in 1886, 1888 and 1896. He was a fellow or member of many chemical and other learned societies, including the
He received the honorary degree of Legum Doctor from William and Mary College, University of Mississippi, Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Pennsylvania. His interest in the US South was emphasised and strengthened by his marriage to Mary Elizabeth Ormond (1836–1886), the daughter of an Alabama judge John James Ormond, in 1857, and again, after the death of his first wife in 1886, to Josephine Burtlhe of Louisiana, in 1888. Josephine survived him with two of the three children from his first marriage, as his first son, John Ormond Mallet, died at an early age.
In 1961, Mallet Assembly, a self-governing residential honours program was created by the University of Alabama. Mallet Assembly was located in Mallet Hall, which was named for him.
Research.
The scientific work of Mallet covered a wide field including general and applied chemistry and chemical mineralogy. He devised methods for the determination of organic matter in potable water and characterised meteorites and rare terrestrial minerals; in particular, he studied the occurrence of silver in the ash of South American volcanoes. He accurately determined the density of solid mercury, molecular weight of hydrofluoric acid and the atomic weights of lithium (1856), aluminium (1880) and gold. For comparison, his result for lithium (6.943) agrees within the error with the currently accepted value of 6.941(2). Mallet also served as expert witness in many court cases involving poisoning, value of iron ore, pollution of river water and other chemical questions.

Béla Iványi-Grünwald

Béla Iványi-Grünwald (6 May 1867 – 24 September 1940) was a Hungarian painter, a leading member of the Nagybánya artists' colony and founder of the Kecskemét artists' colony.
Life.
Born in Som, Iványi-Grünwald began his artistic studies under Bertalan Székely and Károly Lotz at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest (1882–86) and continued them at Munich in 1886-87 and at the Académie Julian in Paris from 1887 to 1890. From 1891 he again worked in Munich; in 1894 he travelled with Ferenc Eisenhut to Egypt, where he painted several oriental-themed works. Beginning in 1889 he had regular exhibitions at the Palace of Art in Budapest. Characteristic of his early pictures is "A Hadúr kardja" ("The Warrior's Sword", 1890), a proto-Symbolist treatment of rural genre showing the influence of Jules Bastien-Lepage. After his return to Munich, Iványi-Grünwald painted a large-scale genre painting entitled "Nihilisták sorsot húznak" ("Nihilists Drawing Lots", 1893), a work as notable for its dramatic use of chiaroscuro as for its deeply felt subject-matter. In response to a state commission for the 1896 Millennium Exhibition in Budapest he produced an enormous academic history painting, "Béla király visszatérése a tatárjárás után" ("King Béla IV's Return following the Invasion Suffered at the Hands of the Tartars").
In 1896, together with Simon Hollósy and his circle (whom he had known at Hollósy's anti-academic painting school in Munich), Iványi-Grünwald arrived at Nagybánya (from 1918 Baia Mare, Romania) in order to concentrate on "plein-air" landscape painting; there, he became an important member of the Nagybánya artists' colony. Two years later he married Irén Bilcz, the daughter of a Greek Catholic priest, and settled in the city. After Hollósy's departure in 1901 he became one of the professors at the free painting academy there. At the Budapest National Salon in 1909 he won great acclaim for his paintings in a new style (Secessionism), which gained him the support he asked from the mayor of the small town of Kecskemét, who asked him to set up an artists' colony. Thus from 1911-18 he led and worked at the Kecskemét artists' colony. After 1920 he lived in Pest, painting near Lake Balaton in summer. That year he was among the founders of the Szinyei Merse Pál Society. He received a number of important commissions, for instance painting a monumental canvas for the University of Debrecen Library. From 1928 he was president of the Szentendre Painters' Association. Along the years he had regular exhibitions in Budapest and displayed his paintings at the Fränkel Salon a number of times. He died in Budapest in 1940.
Style.
Iványi-Grünwald was keenly aware of the various currents of modernism that developed during his career. At first he was influenced by French naturalism ("Ave Maria", 1891; "Juhász és parasztasszony" — "Shepherd and Peasant Woman", 1892). At Nagybánya, undoubtedly the most accomplished phase of his career, he focused on "plein air" and costume scenes ("Holdkelte" — "Moonrise", 1897; "Bércek között" — "Between Crags", 1901; "Itatás" — "Watering", 1902; "Háromkirályok" — "The Three Magi", 1903; "Ruhaszárítás" — "Drying Clothes", 1903). By this time his work had distanced itself from the influence of Bastien-Lepage to concentrate on the changing effects of atmosphere. He emphasized, for example, the mood produced by light at various times of the day and night, as in "Evening by the Cattle Pen" (1896), and used extremely bright colours, not entirely typical of the Nagybánya school as a whole, as with the brilliant greens of "A völgyben" ("In the Valley", "ca." 1901). His subjects were taken from his immediate surroundings and the human figure is shown as an integral part of the landscape. Iványi-Grünwald also taught in Hollósy's Nagybánya school until he took up an award in 1905 that enabled him to spend a year in Rome. In 1906 he held an exhibition of his works in the Ernst Museum in Budapest, and this event effectively announced the end of his Nagybánya period, although he remained there a few more years.
A gradual change was brought about in Iványi-Grünwald's work by the influence of younger Hungarian painters returning from Paris and working in the style of the Fauves. More direct inspiration was provided by the exhibition of modern French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting held in Budapest in 1907; his paintings became more decorative and stylised, his outlines bolder, and his compositions based on flat shapes, as in "Nagybányai táj a Gutinnal" ("View of Nagybánya with the River Gutin", 1906–08). Decorative principles already dominated in the large panel of 1909 for the Révai Villa in Budapest, "Tavasz" ("Spring"), and Paul Gauguin in particular exerted an influence on his art ("Római villa" — "Villa in Rome", 1905; "Cigánylányok a Lápos partján" — "Gypsy Girls by the Banks of the Lápos", 1909). The major work of his Kecskemét phase is "Kecskeméti piac télen" ("Market of Kecskemét in Winter", 1912), of which he painted a number of versions. In style these scenes recalled Gauguin's Brittany paintings, with boldly outlined planes of deep colour. He was also able to paint monumental frescoes at the time ("Fürdés után" — "After Bathing", "ca." 1914). After the mid-1910s his innovative period came to an end and he executed bucolic scenes and a series of pretty landscapes, for the most part vigorously painted and impressionistic in effect ("Oxen on the Shore of Lake Balaton", 1920; the realistic "Tájkép gémeskúttal" — "Sweep-Pole Well", 1924; "Balaton", 1936). In his last years, he painted pictures with movement typical of Baroque, then simple and realistic ones; his still lifes and pictures of Gypsies from this period were less significant.

History of the African National Congress

This article covers the history of the African National Congress, the current ruling party in the Parliament of South Africa.
Origins.
As a resistance movement, the ANC was predated by a number of black resistance movements, among them Umkosi Wezintaba, formed in South Africa between 1890 and 1920.
The ANC was formed on 8 January 1912 by John Dube, Pixley ka Isaka Seme and Sol Plaatje along with chiefs, people's representatives, and church organizations, and other prominent individuals to bring all Africans together as one people to defend their rights and freedoms, the ANC from its inception represented both traditional and modern elements, from tribal chiefs to church and community bodies and educated black professionals, though women were only admitted as affiliate members from 1931 and as full members in 1943.
The formation of the ANC Youth League in 1944 by Anton Lembede heralded a new generation committed to building non-violent mass action against the legal underpinnings of the white minority's supremacy.
In 1946 the ANC allied with the South African Communist Party in assisting in the formation of the South African Mine Workers' Union. After the miners strike became a general strike, the ANC's President General Alfred Bitini Xuma, along with delegates of the South African Indian Congress, attended the 1946 session of the United Nations General Assembly where the treatment of Indians in South Africa was raised by the Government of India. Together, they raised the issue of the police brutality against the miners strike and the wider struggle for equality in South Africa. The ANC also worked with the Natal Indian Congress and Transvaal Indian Congress.
Opposition to Apartheid.
The return of an Afrikaner-led National Party government by the overwhelmingly white electorate in 1948 signaled the advent of the policy of Apartheid. During the 1950s, non-whites were removed from electoral rolls, residence and mobility laws were tightened and political activities restricted.
The successful increase of awareness outside of South Africa achieved in the Indians' movement under the leadership of Gandhi inspired blacks in South Africa to resist the racism and inequality that they, and all other non-whites, were experiencing. The two racial groups began working together, forcing themselves to accept one another and bash their own personal prejudices against one another. This required effort: education supporting the other race and their achievements, and constantly reminding themselves that they needed one another to combat the oppression they were facing. They began collaborating, even jointly campaigning for their struggle to be managed by the United Nations (although in this time, western society was not practising equality for all people either).
The ANC also found its role model in the initial movement by the Indian political parties. They realized that they would need a fervent leader, like Gandhi was for the Indians, who was, in the words of Nelson Mandela, "willing to violate the law and if necessary go to prison for their beliefs as Gandhi had". In 1949 the ANC saw a jump in their membership, which previously lingered around five-thousand, and began to establish a firm presence in South African national society.
In June 1952, the ANC joined with other anti-Apartheid organizations in a Defiance Campaign against the restriction of political, labour and residential rights, during which protesters deliberately violated oppressive laws, following the example of Mahatma Gandhi's passive resistance in KwaZulu-Natal and in India. The campaign was called off in April 1953 after new laws prohibiting protest meetings were passed.
In June 1955 the Congress of the People, organised by the ANC and Indian, Coloured and White organizations at Kliptown near Johannesburg, adopted the Freedom Charter, henceforth the fundamental document of the anti-Apartheid struggle with its demand for equal rights for all regardless of race. As opposition to the regime's policies continued, 156 leading members of the ANC and allied organisations were arrested in 1956; the resulting "Treason Trial" ended with their acquittal five years later.
The ANC first called for an academic boycott of South Africa in protest of its Apartheid policies in 1958 in Ghana. The call was repeated the following year in London.
In 1959 a number of members broke away from the ANC because they objected to the ANC's reorientation from African nationalist policies. They formed the rival Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), led by Robert Sobukwe.
Protest and banning.
The ANC planned a campaign against the Pass Laws, which required blacks to carry an identity card at all times to justify their presence in White areas, to begin on 31 March 1960. The PAC pre-empted the ANC by holding unarmed protests 10 days earlier, during which 69 protesters were killed and 180 injured by police fire in what became known as the Sharpeville massacre.
In the aftermath of the tragedy, both organisations were banned from political activity. International opposition to the regime increased throughout the 1950s and 1960s, fueled by the growing number of newly independent nations, the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Britain and the civil rights movement in the United States. In 1960, the leader of the ANC, Albert Luthuli, won the Nobel Peace Prize, a feat that would be repeated in 1993 by the next leader of the ANC, Nelson Mandela, and F.W. de Klerk jointly, for their actions in helping to negotiate peaceful transition after Mandela's release from prison, which was a great step towards better rights for blacks.
Violent political resistance.
Following the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, the ANC leadership concluded that the methods of non-violence such as those utilised by Gandhi against the British Empire during their colonisation of India were not suitable against the Apartheid system. A military wing was formed in 1961, called Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), meaning "Spear of the Nation", with Mandela as its first leader. MK operations during the 1960s primarily involved targeting and sabotaging government facilities. Mandela was arrested in 1962, convicted of sabotage in 1964 and sentenced to life imprisonment on Robben Island, along with Sisulu and other ANC leaders after the Rivonia Trial.
During the 1970s and 1980s the ANC leadership in exile under Oliver Tambo made the decision to target Apartheid government leadership, command and control, secret police, and military-industrial complex assets and personnel in decapitation strikes, targeted killings, and guerilla actions such as bomb explosions in facilities frequented by military and government personnel. A number of civilians were also killed in these attacks. Examples of these include the Amanzimtoti bombing, the Sterland bomb in Pretoria, the Wimpy bomb in Pretoria, the Juicy Lucy bomb in Pretoria and the Magoo's bar bombing in Durban. ANC acts of sabotage aimed at government institutions included the bombing of the Johannesburg Magistrates Court, the attack on the Koeberg nuclear power station, the rocket attack on Voortrekkerhoogte in Pretoria, and the 1983 Church Street bombing in Pretoria, which killed 16 and wounded 130.
The ANC was classified as a terrorist organisation by the South African government and by some Western countries including the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the ANC had a London office from 1978 to 1994 at 28 Penton Street in Islington, north London, now marked with a plaque.
During this period, the South African military engaged in a number of raids and bombings on ANC bases in Botswana, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland. Dulcie September, a member of the ANC who was investigating the arms trade between France and South Africa was assassinated in Paris in 1988. In the ANC's training camps, the ANC faced allegations that dissident members faced torture, detention without trial and even execution in ANC prison camps. In South Africa, the campaign to make the townships "ungovernable" led to kangaroo courts and mob executions of opponents and collaborators, often by necklacing.
There was violence between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party. For example between 1985 and 1989, 5,000 civilians were killed in fighting between the two parties. Massacres of each other's supporters include the Shell House massacre and the Boipatong massacre.
As the years progressed, the African National Congreses attacks, coupled with international pressure and internal dissent, increased in South Africa. The ANC received financial and tactical support from the USSR, which orchestrated military involvement with surrogate Cuban forces through Angola. However, the fall of the USSR after 1991 brought an end to its funding of the ANC and also changed the attitude of some Western governments that had previously supported the Apartheid regime as an ally against communism. The South African government found itself under increasing internal and external pressure, and this, together with a more conciliatory tone from the ANC, resulted in a change in the political landscape. State President F.W. de Klerk unbanned the ANC and other banned organisations on 2 February 1990, and began peace talks for a negotiated settlement to end Apartheid.
Coming to power.
With the end of apartheid, it was a foregone conclusion that the ANC would not only win the April 1994 general election—the country's first multiracial elections—but do so in a landslide. In that election, the ANC, as the dominant partner in a tripartite alliance with the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, won a comprehensive victory, coming up just a few votes short of the two-thirds majority required to unilaterally amend the Interim Constitution. The new legislature elected Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa, making him the country's first black chief executive.
In Kwa-Zulu Natal, the ANC maintained an uneasy coalition with the Inkatha Freedom Party after neither party won a majority in the 1994 and 1999 provincial elections.
In 2004 the party contested national elections in voluntary coalition with the New National Party (NNP), which it effectively absorbed following the NNP's dissolution in 2005.
After the 1994 and 1999 elections it ruled seven of the nine provinces, with Kwa-Zulu Natal under the IFP and the Western Cape Province under the NNP. As of 2004, it gained both the Western Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal after a combination of the NNP's electoral base being eroded by the DA and a poor showing by the IFP.
Signs of strain.
By 2001 the tripartite alliance between the ANC, COSATU and SACP began showing signs of strain as the ANC moved to more liberal economic policies than its alliance partners were comfortable with. The focus for dissent was the GEAR program, an initialism for "Growth, Employment and Redistribution."
In late 2004 this was again thrown into sharp relief by Zwelinzima Vavi of COSATU protesting the ANC's policy of "quiet diplomacy" towards the worsening conditions in Zimbabwe, as well as Black Economic Empowerment, which he complained benefits a favoured few in the black elite and not the masses.
As of 2005 the alliance was facing a crisis as Jacob Zuma, who was fired from his position as Deputy President of South Africa by Thabo Mbeki, faced corruption charges. Complicating the situation was the fact that Zuma remained Deputy President of the ANC, and maintained a strong following amongst many ANC supporters, and the ANC's alliance partners. In October 2005, top officials in the National Intelligence Agency, who were Zuma supporters, were suspended for illegally spying on an Mbeki supporter, Saki Macozoma, amid allegations that ANC supporters were using their positions within organs of state to spy on, and discredit each other. In December 2005, Zuma was charged with rape and his position as Deputy President of the ANC was suspended.
Jacob Zuma was acquitted of the rape charges, and was reinstated as Deputy President of the organisation. A battle for leadership of the ANC followed, culminating at the party's national conference in Polokwane (16–20 December 2007), where both Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki were nominated for the position of president. On 18 December 2007, Jacob Zuma was elected President of the ANC at the ANC conference in Polokwane
The ANC also faced (sometimes violent) protests in townships over perceived poor service delivery, as well as internal disputes, as local government elections approached in 2006.
The ANC "WaBenzi" are now commonly considered to be more concerned with the spoils of power (such as BMWs, Whisky & Italian Clothes) than they are with furthering the development of the people.

Maumee-class oiler

The "Maumee" class was a class of four United States Navy fleet oilers in service from the mid-1950s until the mid-1980s. It was the first class of United States Naval Ships.
The "Maumee" class ships were the first of the Navy's new "supertankers", significantly larger than previously classes. They also were the first U.S. Navy ships specifically designed and launched with an intention that they be operated in a non-commissioned status by the Military Sea Transportation Service, later the Military Sealift Command, with civilian crews working under contract. They thus became the first United States Naval Ships, and the first to be given the designation "USNS" instead of "USS" (for United States Ship, the long-standing designation for ships in commission and manned by Navy personnel). The "T" appended to the beginning of their hull numbers indicated civilian manning, a convention still in use today. When the lead unit, USNS "Maumee" (T-AO-149), entered service in December 1956, she was the first USNS ship in history.
The ships were not designed for underway replenishment (refueling ships at sea). Rather they were intended to transport bulk petroleum products, such as fuel oil, gasoline, and aviation fuel, to American military forces overseas. At some time after the loss of USNS "Potomac" (T-AO-150) in 1961, the three survivors were reclassified as transport oilers, and were redesignated as such by having an additional "T" appended to their hull numbers.
Naming.
The class was named for its lead unit, "Maumee". All four ships were named after American rivers with Native American names, a traditional convention for U.S. Navy oilers.
Operations.
The ships spent their careers in non-commissioned service in the Military Sea Transport Service, later the Military Sealift Command, operating with civilian crews, from the mid-1950s. After the loss of "Potomac", the survivors served until probably the mid-1980s.
Ships.
USNS "Maumee" (T-AO-149).
"Maumee" transported petroleum primarily in the Pacific, operating in this role between mid-December 1956 and probably the mid-1980s. She eventually was reclassified as a "transport oiler" and redesignated T-AO-149T.
USNS "Potomac" (T-AO-150).
"Potomac" transported petroleum from 1957 until 1961, when she was destroyed pierside by a fire and explosions. Although her forward half was a total loss, her after half was salvaged and used in the construction of fleet oiler USNS "Potomac" (T-AO-181).
USNS "Shoshone" (T-AO-151).
"Shoshone" transported petroleum worldwide between mid-December 1956 and probably the late 1980s. Eventually reclassified as a "transport oiler" and redesignated T-AO-151T.
USNS "Yukon" (T-AO-152).
"Yukon" transported petroleum worldwide between mid-December 1956 and probably the late 1980s. Eventually reclassified as a "transport oiler" and redesignated T-AO-152T.

Shipwright's Arms Hotel

"Not to be confused with the Hobart public house of the same name."
The Shipwright's Arms is an historic de-licensed pub in the inner-west Sydney suburb of Balmain East, looking out across Sydney Harbour to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It currently houses luxury flats.
History.
As one of the first licensed establishments in Balmain, it was built by shipwright John Bell in 1841. In 1844 it was named The Dolphin Hotel when it was leased to Publican William Walker, a former convict who had been transported from Birmingham at the age of 16 on 24 May 1827. It was claimed back in 1846 by John Bell and renamed The Shipwright's Arms. Although numbered as 14 Darling Street, it is effectively the first building in Balmain's main thoroughfare, and one of only a few waterside establishments.
A former favourite haunt of watermen and surreptitious after-hours drinkers, its license was transferred to Miller's Hotel in Manly Vale in 1965.

Keep 6

Keep 6 is a Canadian progressive rock band from Edmonton, Alberta that was formed in early 2006. The band is playing music sometimes at venues around Edmonton. They cite their musical influences as Protest the Hero, Dream Theatre, Coheed & Cambria, Avenged Sevenfold, The Mars Volta, Megadeth, Alice In Chains, and Led Zeppelin.
History.
Hailing from Edmonton, Alberta, Keep 6 is a five-piece original rock band driven by sheer determination to make waves in the Canadian music scene. Formed in 2007, the band consists of Scott Chalmers (guitar), Shorre McColman (vocals), Matthew Wispinski (bass), Jay May (Drums), and the most recent addition in late 2011, Glenn Thorpe (lead guitar). In late 2007, Keep 6 produced their debut album, "Humanifesto". The sound and songs were raw with no holds barred, achieving a successful fan base and number of sales. One song, “Without Being Human”, placed among the top 3 in the regional finals of the Canadian Songwriting Competition sponsored by Bear 100.3 FM. In early 2010, the band released their second album called "Four Fangs". The album produced great independent success for the band as each song was technically driven with clever grooves and choruses. “Four Fangs” was promoted on a successful, national radio campaign throughout the USA. Concluding the campaign, the band was approached by several television production companies for licensing agreements to use their music during the 2011 season. The band is finishing up its third full-length album, entitled "Just A Matter Of Time", with a scheduled release in early 2012. Since their inception, Keep 6 has shared the stage with such acts as A Perfect Circle, Three Days Grace, Sloan, Social Code, Priestess, Matthew Good, Three, and Streetheart. Summer Fests include Boonstock 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011 as well as the Annual Ride for Dad Cancer Fund Raiser. Every live show produces a greater fan base in Western Canada with future plans of expanding towards Eastern Canada.
Discography.
To date, Keep 6 has released their independently recorded debut album "Humanifesto" in 2007, followed by a second album "Four Fangs" in 2010, and are currently working on a third album.

Wuhan Railway Station

The Wuhan Railway Station () is one of the three main passenger railway stations of Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei Province. It is located northeast of Wuhan's East Lake, near a a small lake called Yangchunhu, and is adjacent to the 3rd Ring Road. Administratively, the site is within the Wuhan's Hongshan District.
Wuhan Railway Station is one of the main stations on the Beijing–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway. Completed in December, 2009, the station has 11 platforms and 20 tracks. It serves the Beijing-Hong Kong high speed railway, the Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu passenger line, and Zhengzhou/Jiujiang-bound passenger trains.
Design.
The station was designed by Amenagement, Recherche, Pole d'Echanges (AREP), the Fourth Survey and Design Institute of China, MaP3, and SNCF-IGOA, after winning a two-phase competition in 2005. The design was inspired by the yellow crane, the symbol of Wuhan City. The distinctive roof is intended to resemble the crane's wings, and is based on a sine curve. The building consists of nine separated parts, symbolizing China's nine provinces, plus a central thoroughfare.
Construction.
Construction of the station began in September 2006, and was completed in December 2009. It was built by China State Construction Engineering Corporation, which also built the Wuhan Airport and the Beijing CCTV building. Construction cost exceeded 14 billion Yuan (US$ 2 billion), including upgrades to surrounding infrastructure.
The total construction area of the station is , of which the station building has a floor area, a elevated pedestrian platform, a non-stop pillar canopy, a ground floor, and a ground floor car park. The main arch spans 116 metres and the highest point is 58 metres above the ground.
Services.
Located on the main line of the Beijing–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway, Wuhan Railway Station is served by almost all trains traveling on this railway to or through Wuhan use the Wuhan Railway Station. (Only a small number of trains terminate at the Hankou Railway Station instead). 
Some of the high-speed trains running via Wuhan on the Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu High-Speed Railway use Wuhan Station as well, but most of them use Hankou Railway Station instead. The Wuhan station is also served by many of the high-speed trains to and from Nanchang (traveling on the Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway) use Wuhan Station. 
The number of "conventional" (not high-speed) trains using Wuhan Station is comparatively small; most of those go to the older Hankou or Wuchang stations instead.

Netherbrae

Netherbrae is an area of farmland and small crofts in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is approximately north of Turriff and south-east of Macduff, and is just off the main A98 road.
Netherbrae, like many of the neighbouring small areas, does not form a distinctly identifiable village, but is somewhat ill-defined by maps and roadsigns, and in practice it overlaps with the areas around it including Overbrae, Hill of Overbrae, Mid Clochforbie, and South Clochforbie. Postal addresses in Netherbrae traditionally included the similarly loosely defined Fishrie (sometimes spelt "Fisherie"), but are now officially in the Turriff post town. The postcode district is AB53. Local telephone numbers bear the 01261 area code.
Farming in the region is mixed, with some land given over to crop production, some to sheep and cattle, and some to pockets of forestry. There are a few businesses catering mainly to the agricultural community, a large used-car dealership, and an animal rescue sanctuary.

Jean Driscoll

Jean Driscoll is an American wheelchair racer. She won the women's wheelchair division of the Boston Marathon eight times, more than any other female athlete in any division. Her wins in Boston included seven consecutive first place finishes from 1990 to 1996. Driscoll participated in four Summer Paralympic Games, winning a total of five gold, three silver, and four bronze medals in events ranging from 200 meters to the marathon.
Childhood.
Born with spina bifida, Driscoll grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She began using a wheelchair in high school and became involved in a variety of wheelchair sports. She was recruited to play wheelchair basketball at the University of Illinois, and while there she also joined the school's wheelchair track and field team. She competed at her first Paralympics in 1988, taking bronze in the 200 and 400 meter races, silver in the 4×100 meter relay, and gold in the 4×200 meter relay.
Career.
Her first major win in racing came in 1989, when she beat Candace Cable at the Lilac Bloomsday 12k in Spokane, Washington. Following this success, her coach Marty Morse convinced her to try a marathon. Driscoll participated in the 1989 Chicago Marathon and finished fast enough to qualify for the next year's Boston Marathon. At Morse's urging, she reluctantly agreed to race in Boston; at the time, she was not interested in becoming a regular marathoner and wished to continue racing shorter distances.
Driscoll went on to win the 1990 Boston Marathon, beginning a seven-year winning streak in that race. She set a world record at the 1991 race with a time of 1:42:42, and won her fifth Boston and broke the world record again in 1994, despite a bout of food poisoning days before the race and stiff competition from Australian Louise Sauvage. With Driscoll's win in 1996, she became the first person to win seven consecutive Boston Marathons. Her streak ended the next year, when her wheelchair tire got caught in a trolley track, causing her to crash and the tire to go flat; Sauvage went on to win the race. At the 1998 race, Driscoll was approaching the finish line in first place when Sauvage sprinted past, winning by half a wheel. Driscoll finished in second place behind Sauvage for a third time in 1999. In 2000, Driscoll won for the eighth and last time, giving her more wins at Boston than any other person.
At the 1992 Paralympics, Driscoll won the gold medal in the 4×100 meter relay and competed in three other events—the 800, 1500, and 5000 metre races. Four years later at the Atlanta Games, she competed in four events and medaled in all of them, taking gold in the 10000 metres and the marathon, silver in the 5000 metres, and bronze in the 1500 metres. She added three more medals to her career total at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, winning gold, silver, and bronze in the marathon, 1500 metres, and 5000 metres, respectively.
In 2012 The Lincoln Academy of Illinois granted Driscoll the Order of Lincoln award, the highest honor bestowed by the State of Illinois.
Philanthropy.
Driscoll has supported programing for the disabled by racing in College Church's annual fund raising race.

Manhattan Theatre

The Manhattan Theatre, directly across from Greeley Square at Sixth Avenue and 33rd Street, was located at 102 West 33rd Street, in New York, NY. It was a 1,100-seat theatre which opened in 1875 as the Eagle Variety Theatre, and later renamed the Standard Theatre in 1878. All but destroyed by a fire in 1883, it was re-built in a more modern style and re-opened in December, 1884. In 1898, the Standard was re-furbished by architect Howard Constable and renamed the Manhattan.
Early history.
During its first two decades of existence, the theatre played host to many of the finest plays and works of musical theatre of the times, including several of the authorized American premieres of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in the 1880s, often starring Geraldine Ulmar, Fred Billington, George Thorne and Courtice Pounds. Other Notable performers on its stage in these years included Marie Fedor, Emily Stevens and Tyrone Power, Sr. Gilbert and Sullivan's "Patience" was the theatre's biggest money spinner of the 1880s, running for 177 performances in 1891–92 and earning $100,000. "Charlie's Aunt" opened at the theatre in 1893.
In 1898, William Brady and Florenz Ziegfeld took over the theatre, renaming it the Manhattan Theatre. Possibly the Theatre's biggest coup was the world premiere of "Way Down East", the melodramatic stage play written by Charlotte Blair Parker, which proved to be one of the biggest American stage success of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Opening on February 7, 1898, the play ran for 152 performances, ending in June, 1898. Among other early productions was "Lover's Lane", a 1901 production on rural life, that starred Lillian Lee in the role of Mrs. Jennings.
Fiske years.
The Manhattan Theatre became a frequent venue for the theatrical performances of Minnie Maddern Fiske, one of the most famous actresses of the 1890s and early 1900s, renowned for her performances in Ibsen’s plays. Mrs. Fiske also co-managed and directed plays for the Manhattan Theatre. Among Mrs. Fiske's many performances was the leading role in "Miranda of the Balcony", a play written by Anne Crawford Flexner, based on the novel by A.E.W. Mason. Produced at the Manhattan Theatre on September 24, 1901, it starred Mrs. Fiske, J.E. Dodson, Emily Stevens, Max Figman, Frank McCormack, Bessie Harris and Mary Maddern. It was directed by Mrs. Fiske and Max Figman. "The New York Times" review of the opening said: "The opening of the Manhattan Theatre under the management of Harrison Grey Fiske was effected last night, and a new drama entitled "Miranda of the Balcony" was performed for the first time on any stage. The occasion was one which may possibly prove to be significant. The new manager defines his policy in the programme, and the definition is attractive." 
Under Harrison Grey Fiske's management (assisted quite regularly by Mrs. Fiske), the Manhattan Theatre enjoyed its most productive years. Starting with "Miranda of the Balcony", it produced many great dramas. In "Miranda of the Balcony", Emily Stevens had the part of Lady Ethel Mickleham, while Mrs. Fiske played Miranda Warriner, a role for which she was praised for her interpretation of the principal character. In November, 1901, the company of Mrs. Fiske staged "The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch" at the Manhattan Theatre. The author of the play is either Constance Cary Harrison or David Belasco. The theme of the work has to do with a woman who becomes a social outcast because of marital problems. Emily Stevens played the role of Gladys Lorimer.
In May, 1902, Mrs. Fiske put on a revival of Tess of the D'Urbervilles at the theatre. Emily Stevens was among the players in a recreation of this production of Mrs. Fiske first staged in 1897. Stevens became a permanent member of the company of Mrs. Fiske in 1904, following three seasons on stage. Emily Stevens acted the role of Miriam for all 105 performances of Mary of Magdala in 1904. In that same production, which was written by William Winter, Tyrone Power, Sr. played the role of Judas Iscariot. Conflicting records claim that this production was staged either in November, 1902 or in 1904.
The Manhattan Theatre presented "Becky Sharp" in September, 1904. Based on "Vanity Fair" by William Makepeace Thackery, the comedy in four acts, was written by Langdon Mitchell. Mrs. Fiske and the Manhattan Company brought it before audiences with Stevens and George Arliss as cast principals. A revival of Hedda Gabler was staged in November, 1904 with Mrs. Fiske in the title role and Emily Stevens as Berta. The Henrik Ibsen work played for one week in 1903 with near capacity attendance for each performance. Leah Kleschna was written especially for Mrs. Fiske by C.M.S. McLellan (Hugh Morton). The Manhattan Theatre presented the play about the daughter of a thief in December, 1904. The production marked the first original role Fiske had depicted in two years. Stevens, George Arliss, John Mason, and Marie Fedor were among the players. In 1905, the Manhattan Theatre produced The Proud Laird, a comedy by Charles Cartwright and Cosmo Hamilton. It starred Robert Loraine, Hubert Hassard-Short, J.H. Bunny, Sydney Smith, Ida Vernon and Dorothy Donnelly. Interestingly, it was directed by Harrison Grey Fiske, husband of Minnie Maddern Fiske. The Fiske company managed the Manhattan Theatre for eight years, until 1907, when the theatre switched to vaudeville and motion pictures.
Last years.
By 1907, the Manhattan Theatre was no longer in demand as a playhouse, so a new owner switched to showing movies instead. The theatre had just one screen, and to justify a 10-cent admission charge, several acts of vaudeville were added to the programs. This was reportedly the first time that a New York theatre had shown movies as the main attraction. Previously, movies had just been supplements to vaudeville.
In 1909, the Manhattan was demolished to make way for Gimbels department store, a structure that still stands today but has been converted into a shopping mall.

Creek Road (SEPTA Route 102 station)

Creek Road (formerly Oakview) is a stop on the SEPTA Route 102 (Sharon Hill) trolley line in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. It is located at the end of Station Road north of Creek Road(although SEPTA gives the address as being at Darby Creek Road at Railroad) within Indian Rock Park, a Natural Environmental Park in Drexel Hill, containing picnic tables, playground equipment, basketball courts, and Darby Creek.
Trolleys arriving at this station travel between 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania. Oakview might have little significance were it not for the fact that the stop is near the bridge over Darby Creek and Creek Road. Besides the aforementioned features within Indian Rock Park, the street leads to a historic Swedish Log Cabin built sometime around 1654, which is believed to be the oldest log house in North America.

History of the Communist Party of China

This article details the history of the Communist Party of China.
History during the Revolution.
Establishment of the Party.
Marxist ideas started to spread widely in China after the 1919 May Fourth Movement. In June 1920, Comintern agent Grigori Voitinsky was sent to China, and met Li Dazhao and other reformers. He financed the founding of the Socialist Youth Corps. The Communist Party of China was initially founded by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in the French concession of Shanghai in 1921 as a study society and an informal network. There were informal groups in China in 1920, and also overseas, but the official beginning was the 1st Congress held in Shanghai and attended by 53 men in July 1921 and later transferred from Shanghai to Jiaxing. The birth of the party was declared here in a boat on South Lake. It is therefore considered by the Chinese to be one of the most important historical places of the revolution. The formal and unified name "Zhōngguó Gòngchǎn Dǎng" (Chinese Communist Party) was adopted and all other names of communist groups were dropped and the final agenda was carried out. The key players were Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Chen Gongbo, Tan Pingshan, Zhang Guotao, He Mengxiong, Lou Zhanglong and Deng Zhongxia. Mao Zedong was present at the first congress as one of two delegates from a Hunan communist group. Other attendees included Dong Biwu, Li Hanjun, Li Da, Chen Tanqiu, Liu Renjing, Zhou Fohai, He Shuheng, Deng , and two representatives from the Comintern, one of them being Henk Sneevliet (also known by the single name 'Maring'). Notably absent at this early point were future leaders Li Lisan and Qu Qiubai.
First Civil Revolution period - the 1st United Front (1922–1927).
In August 1922, Sneevliet called a surprise special plenum of the central committee and proposed that party members join the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party) on the grounds that it was easier to transform the Nationalist Party from the inside than to duplicate its success. According to Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Cai Heshen and Gao Yuhan opposed the motion, whereupon Maring invoked the authority of the Comintern and forced the CCP to accept his decision.
Under the guidance of the Comintern, the party was reorganized along Leninist lines in 1923, in preparation for the Northern Expedition. However, the nascent party was not held in high regard: Karl Radek, one of the five founding leaders of the Comintern, said in November 1922 that the CCP did not enjoy a high reputation in Moscow. Moreover, it was divided into two camps, led by Deng Zhongxia and Li Dazhao on the more moderate "bourgeois, national revolution" model and Zhang Guotao, Lou Zhanglong, He Mengxiong and Chen Duxiu on the strongly anti-imperialism side.
The role of the Comintern cannot be overstated. Mikhail Markovich Borodin negotiated with Sun Yat-sen and Wang Weeing the 1923 KMT reorganization and the CPC’s incorporation into the newly expanded party. Borodin and megan Vasilii Blyukher (known as ‘Galen’) worked with Chiang Kai-shek to found the Whampoa Military Academy. And, it was the CCP’s reliance on the leadership of the Comintern that was the first indication that the 1923-27 First United Front was fragile. The death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 created great uncertainty regarding who would lead the party, and whether they would still work with the Communists.
Despite the tensions, the Northern Expedition (1926–1927) led by Kuomingtang and participated by CCP gained some quick successes in overthrowing the warlord government.
Second Civil Revolution period – Soviet Republic of China (1927–1937).
In 1927, as the Northern Expedition approached Shanghai, the Kuomintang leadership split. The Left Kuomintang at Wuhan kept the alliance with the Communists. Chiang Kai-shek at Nanking grew increasingly hostile to them and launched a campaign against them. This happened after the capture of Shanghai, which occurred with the Communists and Kuomintang still in alliance. André Malraux's novel, "Man's Fate" (French: "La Condition Humaine"), is based on these events.
The anti-communist drive became general. The CPC was massacred with more than four in five members being killed. As Chiang Kai-shek consolidated his power, various revolts continued, and Communist armed forces created a number of 'Soviet Areas'. The largest of these was led by Zhu De and Mao Zedong, who established Soviet Republic of China in some remote areas within China through peasant riots. A number of military campaigns from KMT army failed, but meantime the party leadership were driven out of Shanghai and moved to Mao's base, sidelining him. 
Chiang Kai-shek launched a further campaign which succeeded. The CPC had to give up their bases and started the Long March (1934–1935) to search for a new base. During the Long March, the party leadership re-examined its policy and blamed their failure on the CPC military leader Otto Braun, a German sent by Comintern. During the Long March, the native Communists, such as Mao Zedong and Zhu De gained power. The Comintern and Soviet Union. lost control over the CPC. They settled in Shensi, where there was an existing Communist base.
The Western world first got a clear view of the main base of the Communist Party of China through Edgar Snow's Red Star Over China. Snow was also the first person to present Mao as the main leader - he was previously seen as just a guerilla leader and mostly as second to Zhu De (Chu Teh).
Sino-Japanese War period - 2nd United Front (1937-1945).
During the Second Sino-Japanese war (1937–1945), the CPC and KMT were temporarily in alliance to fight their common enemy. The Communist government moved from Bao'an (Pao An) to Yan'an (Yenan) in December 1936. The Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army became army groups belonging to the national army (8th route army and New 4th Army), and the Soviet Republic of China changed its name as a special Shaan-Gan-Ning administration region (named after the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia provinces at the borders of each it was located). However, essentially the army and the region controlled by CPC remained independent from the KMT’s government.
In eight years, the CCP membership increased from 40,000 to 1,200,000 and its military forces - from 30,000 to approximately one million in addition to more than one million militia support groups.
It is a well accepted idea that without the Japanese invasion, the CPC might not have developed so fast. This accelerated development is attributed by some to the lack of attention the CPC paid to the war against Japan, they argue that the Chinese Communists took advantage of the KMT's preoccupation with the Japanese to gain an edge on the nationalists. This, however, wasn't entirely true as the Chinese Communists did wage costly Hundred Regiments Offensive and guerrilla wars against Japanese occupied areas.
Third Civil Revolution periods (1946-1949).
After the conclusion of WWII, the civil war resumed between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Despite initial gains by the KMT, they were eventually defeated and forced to flee to off-shore islands, most notably Taiwan. In the war, the US supported the Kuomintang and the USSR supported the CPC, but both with limited degrees. With the Kuomintang's defeat, Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.
As ruling party.
The CPC's ideologies have significantly evolved since its founding and establishing political power in 1949. Mao's revolution that founded the PRC was nominally based on Marxism-Leninism with a rural focus based on China's social situations at the time. During the 1960s and 1970s, the CPC experienced a significant ideological breakdown with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev and their allies. Since then Mao's peasant revolutionary vision and so-called "continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat" stipulated that class enemies continued to exist even though the socialist revolution seemed to be complete, giving way to the "Cultural Revolution". This fusion of ideas became known officially as "Mao Zedong Thought", or Maoism outside of China. It represented a powerful branch of communism that existed in opposition to the Soviet Union's "Marxist revisionism".
Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, however, the CPC under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping moved towards "Socialism with Chinese characteristics" and instituted Chinese economic reform. In reversing some of Mao's "extreme-leftist" policies, Deng argued that a socialist country and the market economy model were not mutually exclusive. While asserting the political power of the Party itself, the change in policy generated significant economic growth. The ideology itself, however, came into conflict on both sides of the spectrum with Maoists as well as progressive liberals, culminating with other social factors to cause the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests. Deng's vision for economic success and a new socialist market model became entrenched in the Party constitution in 1997 as "Deng Xiaoping Theory".
The "third generation" of leadership under Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, and associates largely continued Deng's progressive economic vision while overseeing the re-emergence of Chinese nationalism in the 1990s. Nationalist sentiment has seemingly also evolved to become informally the part of the Party's guiding doctrine. As part of Jiang's nominal legacy, the CPC ratified the "Three Represents" into the 2003 revision of the Party Constitution as a "guiding ideology", encouraging the Party to represent "advanced productive forces, the progressive course of China's culture, and the fundamental interests of the people." There are various interpretations of the "Three Represents". Most notably, the theory has legitimized the entry of private business owners and quasi-"bourgeoisie" elements into the party.
The insistent road of focusing almost exclusively on economic growth has led to a wide range of serious social problems. The CPC's "fourth generation" of leadership under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, after taking power in 2003, attempted reversing such a trend by bringing forth an integrated ideology that tackled both social and economic concerns. This new ideology was known as the creation of a Socialist Harmonious Society using the Scientific Development Concept.
The degree of power the Party had on the state has gradually decreased as economic liberalizations progressed. The evolution of CPC ideology has gone through a number of defining changes that it no longer bears much resemblance to its founding principles. Some believe that the large amount of economic liberalization starting from the late 1970s to present, indicates that the CPC has transitioned to endorse economic neoliberalism. The CPC's current policies are fiercely rejected as capitalist by most communists, especially anti-revisionists, and by adherents of the Chinese New Left from within the PRC.
The Communist Party of China comprises a single-party state form of government; however, there are parties other than the CPC within China, which report to the United Front Department of the Communist Party of China and do not act as opposition or independent parties. Since the 1980s, as its commitment to Marxist ideology has appeared to wane, the party has begun to increasingly invoke Chinese nationalism as a legitimizing principle as opposed to the socialist construction for which the party was originally created. The change from socialism to nationalism has pleased the CPC's former enemy, the Kuomintang (KMT), which has warmed its relations with the CPC since 2003.

Beetlejuice's Rock and Roll Graveyard Revue

Beetlejuice's Graveyard Mash-Up (formerly known as Beetlejuice's Rock and Roll Graveyard Revue) or Beetlejuice's Rockin' Graveyard Revue or Universal Monsters Live Rock and Roll Show is a live stage show based on the film of the same name and Universal's Classic Monsters. It is located at Universal Studios Florida, Universal Studios Japan, and, formerly, at Universal Studios Hollywood. The venue at the Hollywood park was removed in 2002, and replaced by "Spider-Man Rocks".
History.
The attraction opened at both Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in 1992. The Florida venue replaced "An American Tail Theatre" which was opened with the park on June 7, 1990, and the Hollywood venue replaced "", which opened in the Castle Theater in 1983. It was once located in a small outdoor theater (where Coke Soak is currently occupied) before moving indoors in 1995. 
The venue at Universal Studios Florida was refurbished in 1994, to include the addition of a canopy to block the sun. 
Since 2002, the show itself has undergone a number of revamps, when more modern songs and costumes were added. In addition, The Phantom of the Opera was replaced by Hip and Hop, Beetlejuice's Translyvanian cheerleaders. 
In 2006, Universal revamped the show with a new opening, different songs (with the exception of "I Will Survive" and "It's Raining Men"), and slightly more adult themes, which earned it a PG-13 rating.
In late January 2014, Universal closed the show for another revamp, which opened to park-going audiences February 8, 2014, under the name, "Beetlejuice's Graveyard Mash-Up". This version has a new opening and new songs. In addition, Hip and Hop are replaced by four silent ghosts, Phantasia, the Phantom of the Opera's daughter, and Cleopatra.
The show in Orlando and Japan remains operating today, while the show in Hollywood was removed in 1999, and replaced by "Spider-Man Rocks". The Japan venue is called "Universal Monsters Live Rock and Roll Show".
Halloween Horror Nights.
The stage for "Beetlejuice" at Universal Studios Florida has been used to house shows at the park's Halloween Horror Nights. It has been used to make the following shows thus far.
Summary.
Original Version.

Robot Operating System

Robot Operating System (ROS) is a software framework for robot software development, (see also Robotics middleware) providing operating system-like functionality on a heterogeneous computer cluster. ROS was originally developed in 2007 under the name "switchyard" by the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in support of the Stanford AI Robot STAIR project. As of 2008, development continues primarily at Willow Garage, a robotics research institute/incubator, with more than twenty institutions collaborating in a federated development model.
ROS provides standard operating system services such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. It is based on a graph architecture where processing takes place in nodes that may receive, post and multiplex sensor, control, state, planning, actuator and other messages. The library is geared toward a Unix-like system (Ubuntu Linux is listed as 'supported' while other variants such as Fedora and Mac OS X are considered 'experimental').
ROS has two basic "sides": The operating system side "ros" as described above and "ros-pkg", a suite of user contributed packages (organized into sets called "metapackages") that implement functionality such as simultaneous localization and mapping, planning, perception, simulation etc.
Despite the importance of robot reactivity, ROS is not a realtime OS, though it is possible to integrate ROS with realtime code.
ROS is released under the terms of the BSD license, and is open source software. It is free for commercial and research use. The "ros-pkg" contributed packages are licensed under a variety of open source licenses.
In August 2013, a blog posting announced that Willow Garage would be absorbed by another company started by its founder, Suitable Technologies. In February 2013, ROS stewardship transitioned to the Open Source Robotics Foundation. The support for the PR2 created by Willow Garage is taken over by Clearpath Robotics 
Applications.

Rule-based system

In computer science, rule-based systems are used as a way to store and manipulate knowledge to interpret information in a useful way. They are often used in artificial intelligence applications and research.
Applications.
A classic example of a rule-based system is the domain-specific expert system that uses rules to make deductions or choices. For example, an expert system might help a doctor choose the correct diagnosis based on a cluster of symptoms, or select tactical moves to play a game.
Rule-based systems can be used to perform lexical analysis to compile or interpret computer programs, or in natural language processing.
Rule-based programming attempts to derive execution instructions from a starting set of data and rules. This is a more indirect method than that employed by an imperative programming language, which lists execution steps sequentially.
Construction.
A typical rule-based system has four basic components:

Augusta Symphony Orchestra (Augusta, Georgia)

The Symphony Orchestra Augusta (formerly the Augusta Symphony Orchestra) was founded in 1954, the orchestra has grown from a small group of 15 musicians to a full symphony orchestra offering four concert series each season as well as a strong education and outreach program bringing music into the schools and local community. The symphony was first under the baton of Harry Jacobs and then, from 1990 to 2009, under the baton of Dr. Donald Portnoy. The current Music Director and Conductor is Shizuo Z Kuwahara.
History.
The orchestra debuted on May 23, 1954, under the baton of its founding conductor, Harry M. Jacobs (former French horn musician of the Chicago and Minnesota orchestras). Community involvement and the formation of three volunteer support groups followed. In the summer of 1957, The Augusta Symphony Orchestra Guild was formed, its purpose "to aid and assist the Augusta Symphony Orchestra in its continued growth and to broaden its activities". The formation of The Augusta Symphonic League followed in 1961, its purpose "to nurture an awareness and education of its members regarding the activities and mission of the Augusta Symphony, and to financially support the symphony". Another volunteer support arm for the orchestra, The Friends of the Symphony Association, was organized in 1981, its purpose "to promote interest in the Augusta Symphony and in orchestral music, to sponsor activities to support the Symphony, and to foster community participation in Symphony programs."
The 1956–86 season expanded the audience across the state line, into South Carolina, with the establishment of the Aiken Concert Series funded by the Aiken Symphony Guild. During the 1986–87 season, four full-time core musicians were hired creating the Augusta Symphony String Quartet. The following season, three additional musicians were hired to fulfill the principal positions of bassoon, clarinet, and oboe creating the Augusta Symphony Woodwind Trio. Also during this season, the Discovery Series of fall and spring young people's concerts was implemented. The Discovery Program included annual Strong Quartet and Woodwind Trip lecture-demonstrations in Aiken and Columbia County schools. This program has expanded so that today's "Music in the Schools" presents the String Quartet, Woodwind Trio, Principal Percussion and Principal Bass players for schools in the area.
The 1991-92 season was the first season for music director and conductor Donald Portnoy, who has enhanced the quality of the orchestra and its four concert series. Maestro Portnoy increased the number of Masterworks concerts and initiated the "Pops! at the Bell Series" and the "Encore Chamber Series". The following season introduced a Sunday afternoon "Family Series" of three concerts and a "Symphony Youth Competition". Another community outreach program, "Music to the People", was added during the 2002-03 season. A series of pops and light classics concerts presented by a 40 member promenade orchestra, "Music to the People" concerts offer a way to provide outlying CSRA communities with orchestral music. The 2004-05 season marked the Symphony's 50th anniversary season, an occasion celebrated with a Stephen Paulus commission in a world premier concert featuring Metropolitan Opera Soprano Deborah Voigt. The 50th anniversary season closed with the debut of "Pops! Under the Stars", a free outdoor community concert.
During the 2005-06 season the "Masterworks Series" was moved to a new venue, First Baptist of Augusta, where the outstanding acoustics and increased seating improved the overall concert experience. In the 2007–2008 season a fourth concert was added to "Pops! at the Bell Series".
Concert series.
The Symphony Series is presented in the main auditorium at First Baptist of Augusta and consists of six concerts covering major symphonic works throughout music history.
Pops! at the Bell consists of four concerts which offer lighter fare, featuring popular music artists with SOA at the Bell Auditorium in downtown Augusta, Ga.
Discovery Series concerts are aimed at attracting children to the symphony and to classical music.
The Columbia County Music Series offers people in Columbia County the opportunity to attend classical music concerts in their own community.
Pops! Under the Stars is a yearly free, outdoor concert presented by SOA.

List of Ukrainian rulers

This list encompasses all rulers and leaders of what is today Ukraine, from ancient to modern times. It includes only local rulers whose seat of power was located in the modern Ukraine and only the rulers whose power was derived directly from the people of the territory at the time, and does not include the governors who received their authority from some foreign powers (as during Lithuanian, Polish, Hungarian, Austrian, Russian, Czechoslovakian and Romanian overlordship).
This is not a list of sovereigns. Throughout its history the territory of modern Ukraine had various forms of governance from monarchies to democratic republics.
Antiquity (c. 500 BC – 16 BC).
Scythian kings.
Scythia was a loose state that originated as early as the 8th century BC. Little is known of them and their rulers. Most detailed description came down to us from Herodotus.
Kings of Cimmerian Bosporus.
The shores of Crimea were settled by Greeks since the 7th century BC. The kingdom was established around 480 BC. It was ruled by three consecutive dynasties: Archaenactidae (480 BC – 438 BC), Spartocids (438 BC – 108 BC), and Pontids (108 BC – 16 BC). After Pontids the territory became a Roman client kingdom.
Pontids
Migration period (c. 200 – c. 800).
In Eastern Europe the The Great Migration Period kicked off with the descent of the Goths from the Baltic region into the territory of modern Ukraine, about AD 200. They either took over or assimilated with the local Slavic tribes. The Goths were in turn pushed out by aggressively encroaching Huns, about 375. The Goths went on to conquer Southern Europe and the Huns moved to the Balkans and created a Hunnic Empire which lasted for a hundred years. After splitting of the Empire, some of the Huns moved back north in the territories of modern Ukraine and formed Patria Onoguria, now known as Old Great Bulgaria. In the 7th century Onoguria largely defected to Khazaria – an expanding Turkic state centered in the North Caucuses which controlled the Eurasian steppe until the 9th century.
Gothic rulers.
In 238, the Goths for the first time passed the Danube, and took to the Black Sea. The division of the Goths (Thervingi-Vesi and Greuthungi-Ostrogothi) is first attested in 291.
Tervingi
The Balti dynasty, Balth(e)s, Baltungs, or Balthings, existed among the Tervingi ("forest people"), called later the Visigothi. The names of the Drevlyans and the Gothic Tervingi in Ukraine have often been adduced as parallels to "agac-ari" ("forest men" in Turkic).
Greuthungi
The Amali dynasty, Amals, Amaler, or Amalings of the Greuthungi ("steppe dwellers" or "people of the pebbly coasts"), called later the Ostrogothi.
Rulers of Patria Onoguria.
According to Zakarius Rhetor and Priscus Rhetor, Patria Onoguria was a vulgar statelet in alliance with Byzantium established in 463 around Azov having been forced west upon the Akatziroi by the Sabirs who in turn were being attacked. Its 7th century period is commonly referred to as Old Great Bulgaria (~600–~690).
Khazar rulers.
Khazar Khaganate controlled much of what is today southern and eastern Ukraine until the 10th century.
Rulers of Kyiv and Kievan Rus' (c. 375/800 – 1240/1362).
Rurik Dynasty.
The Rurikids were descendants of Rurik ("Hrørekr"), a Varangian pagan konung or chieftain from Sweden, who supposedly was of haplogroup N1c1, which is common among Finno-Ugric peoples and not so rare in Baltic region.
All the rulers of Kievan Rus' before the conversion of Vladimir I and all the country to Christianity are Pagan rulers, except Olga of Kiev.
Decline of Kievan Rus'.
After the Council of Liubech in 1097 Kievan Rus' entered a feudal period and was divided into principalities ruled by the Rurikid family princes who were in a constant power struggle with each other. Major principalities were: Galicia-Volhynia, Kiev, Chernigiv, and Pereyaslavl. In the period of 1240–1362, the three latter ones were forced to accept the Golden Horde overlordship.
Kings and Princes of Galicia-Volhynia (1199–1349).
Galicia-Volhynia was a Ruthenian (Ukrainian) state in Galicia and Volhynia. Depending on the title of the ruler it was called either principality or kingdom. The first king, Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria, was crowned in 1215, although the first nominal king of Galicia was Andrew II of Hungary, the son of Béla III of Hungary, who reigned from 1188 to 1190.
In 1349, Liubartas lost all territories, except for eastern Volhynia, to Casimir III of Poland. In 1366, a Polish-Lithuanian treaty was signed: eastern Volhynia with Lutsk retained under Liubartas' rule (the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), while Galicia, western Volhynia, and western Podolia were annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.
In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1362–1569) and Kingdom of Poland (1569–1667/1793).
Princes of Kiev
In early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Gediminas defeated a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kiev at the Battle on the Irpen' River, and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kiev, retaliated in 1324–1325, so while Kiev was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay a tribute to the Golden Horde. Finally, as a result of the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, Kiev and surrounding areas were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.
Voivodes of Kiev
When the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was formed by the Union of Lublin in 1569, Kiev and surrounding areas, Podolia, Volhynia, and Podlaskie, as the Kiev Voivodeship, Bratslav Voivodeship, Volhynian Voivodeship, and Podlaskie Voivodeship, were transferred from Lithuania to Poland.
Crimean khans (1441–1783).
Crimean Tatars were not of the Ukrainian ethnos. Their Crimean Khanate ruled a large part of modern Ukraine, with a capital at Bakhchisaray.
† The reigns of Canibek Giray in 1624 and of Maqsud Giray in 1771–1772 are not listed. Though these khans were formally appointed by Ottoman sultans they did not reach the throne and did not rule Crimea. In the years mentioned, the authority in the Crimean Khanate was exercised by Mehmed III Giray and Sahib II Giray correspondingly.
The nominal khans Şahbaz Giray (1787–1789) and Baht Giray (1789–1792) mentioned in some works are not listed in this table as they did not rule the Crimean Khanate annexed by Russian Empire in 1783.
Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks (1506–1775).
A Hetman was a military and civil leader, democratically elected by the Cossacks.
Hetmans and commanders of Ukrainian Cossacks.
Several Cossack regiments were operating in Ukraine at this time that were largely independent of each other, so some of the Hetmans' tenures overlap.
Hetmans of the Cossack state.
Following the Khmelnytsky uprising a new Cossack republic, the Hetmanate, was formed.
Hetmans during the Ruin.
The Ruin (1660–1687) was a time in Ukrainian history when the country fell into disarray and chaos. Afterwards, the Cossack state emerged as a vassal of the Russian Empire. During this period a number of hetmans stayed in power for short periods of time and often controlled only parts of the country. Moreover the Treaty of Andrusovo (1667) split the Cossack Hetmanate along the Dnieper River into Left-bank Ukraine, which enjoyed a degree of autonomy within the Tsardom of Russia; and Right-bank Ukraine which remained part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at times (1672–1699) occupied by the Ottoman Empire.
In the Russian Empire (1667/1793–1917) and Austria-Hungary (1526/1772–1918).
After the dissolution of the Cossack Hetmanate, a new Malorossiyan collegium was established in 1764, and the Zaporozhian Host was disbanded in 1775. As a result of the second and third Partitions of Poland in 1793 and 1795, eastern and central parts of Ukraine were incorporated directly into the Russian Empire. Western Ukraine was annexed into the Habsburg Monarchy earlier, in the following order: Carpathian Ruthenia (1526), Galicia (1772), and Bukovina (1775).
The Russian Empire existed until 1917, and the Dual Monarchy, Austria–Hungary, existed until 1918.
Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–1921).
The Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR, 1917–1921) was formed after the Russian Revolution of 1917, and lasted until the Peace of Riga between Poland and Soviet Russia in March 1921. The leadership title varied and, despite a rather widespread misconception, none of them had the official title of president.
Chairmen of the Central Council.
The Central Council ("Tsentral’na rada") was the representative body governing the UNR.
Hetman of the Ukrainian State.
A very short lived Hetmanate was established by Pavlo Skoropadskyi in 1918.
Chairmen of the Directory.
The Directorate of Ukraine was a provisional council of the UNR formed after Skoropadskyi's Hetmanate fell apart. On 22 January 1919, the Act of Unification of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian People's Republic was passed. The text of the universal was made by the members of the Directory.
West Ukrainian People's Republic (1918–1919).
The government of the West Ukrainian People's Republic (WUNR) was proclaimed on 19 October 1918. WUNR was united with the Ukrainian People's Republic on 22 January 1919, although it was mostly a symbolic act while the western Ukrainians retained their own Ukrainian Galician Army and government structure. After the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918–1919), Poland took over most of territory of the West Ukrainian People's Republic by July 1919. Since November 1919, the government of the WUNR was in exile.
Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918/1921–1991).
Ukraine was incorporated into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on 30 December 1922.
Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine
First Secretary of the Central Committee
Executive Secretary of the Central Committee
First Secretaries of the Communist Party
General Secretaries of the Central Committee
First Secretaries of the Central Committee
Ukraine (1991 – present).
On 5 July 1991, the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR passed a law establishing the post of the President of the Ukrainian SSR. The title was changed to the President of Ukraine upon the proclamation of independence (24 August 1991). The first election of the President of Ukraine was held on 1 December 1991.

Willy Stöwer

Willy Stöwer (22 May 1864 – 31 May 1931) was a German artist, illustrator, author and professor during the Imperial Period. He is best known for nautical paintings and lithographs. Many of his works depict historical maritime events such as the sinking of the RMS "Titanic" in 1912.
Life.
Willy Stöwer, the son of a sea captain, was born in Wolgast, Germany on the Baltic coast. He originally trained as a metalworker and worked as a technician in the engineering offices of various German shipyards. He soon received commissions as a draftsman, illustrator and painter. His talent was recognized early and his painting technique was self-taught. In 1892 he married Henrietta Dettmann from a wealthy family, and this allowed him to devote himself exclusively to his work as an artist.
Kaiser Wilhelm II became an enthusiastic supporter and patron of the artist and Stöwer was said to the Kaiser's favorite naval painter. Stöwer even accompanied the Emperor on several voyages between 1905 and 1912. He was a board member of the German Navy League () and was awarded an honorary professorship in 1907. The course of his life then followed that of his patron and the fate of the Imperial German Navy. As with contemporaries such as Hans Bohrdt, his greatest creative period came to an end with the abdication of the Kaiser and the passing of the Imperial era. His later career, being without Imperial favor, relied on a few commissions from steamship lines. He died in relative obscurity at his Berlin-Tegel villa on 31 May 1931, nine days after his 67th birthday.
Career.
Stöwer was a very prolific artist between 1892 and 1929, creating approximately 900 black-and-white and 335 color illustrations for 57 books, as well as posters, postcards, trading-cards, labels, brochures and calendars. An early example of his Commercial art is a series of trading cards from 1899~1900 which he made for the German chocolate producer Stollwerck entitled "The New German Warships" in "Scrapbook No. 3, Series 132".
Stöwer's representation of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in the magazine "Die Gartenlaube" earned him a special popularity. He created the illustration shortly after the disaster in 1912 without detailed information, in particular, the fourth funnel did not eject black smoke as it was only for ventilation. However, the image became iconic despite minor errors and has been reprinted numerous times even to the present day. Stöwer, not known for portraiture, also painted a portrait of the Kaiser in a naval uniform, which along with some of his naval paintings, hang in the Kaiser's Room at Achilleion, the Kaiser's summer palace from 1907 to 1914 (currently a museum) on the Island of Corfu.
Other examples of Stöwer's work currently in museums include oil on canvas: "Sinking of the Italian destroyer "Turbine" by Austrian destroyers on 24 May 1915." at the Military History Museum, Vienna, and: "Speedboat ahead!" at International Maritime Museum of Hamburg. In 1917, postcards were produced from some of his paintings for charitable aid to benefit wounded U-boat crew members and families of the deceased during World War I.
Published works.
In addition to his works in the visual arts, he wrote, published or edited several German books, and is credited as co-author on many more. Books by Willy Stöwer include:

Brigadier General Robert Nugent (June 27, 1824-June 20, 1901) was an Irish-born American U.S. Army officer during the American Civil War and the Indian Wars. He served with the Irish Brigade's 69th Infantry Regiment, from its days as a National Guard unit and into its incorporation into the Union Army at the start of the war, and was one of its senior officers at the First Battle of Bull Run. 
When the unit was originally mustered out of service, the 90-day enlistment terms having expired, Nugent accepted a commission as a captain in the regular army. He was immediately assigned to the 13th Infantry Regiment whose commanding officer, Colonel William Tecumseh Sherman, personally requested. Taking a leave of absence to return to New York, he assisted Thomas Francis Meagher in organizing the Irish Brigade. The newly reformed 69th Infantry Regiment was the first unit assigned to the Irish Brigade and, with Nugent as its colonel, he led the "Fighting 69th" at the Battles of Fair Oaks, Gaines Mill, Savage Station, White Oak Swamp, Glendale, Malvern Hill, and Antietam.
Nugent was wounded, shot in the stomach, at the Battle of Fredericksburg and was eventually forced to resign his command. He was appointed acting assistant provost marshal for the southern district of New York, which included New York City and Long Island, by the US War Department. An Irish Catholic and Democrat, his appointment was thought to assure the Irish-American population that conscription efforts would be carried out fairly. The "Irish-American", a popular Irish-language newspaper, wrote that the selection was a ""wise and deservedly popular one"". He did encounter resistance from city officials wanting remain uninvolved, however by mid-June had reported to his superior officer and provost marshal general Colonel James Fry that conscription efforts were ""nearing completion without serious incident"". Understanding the seriousness of the situation, he attempted to keep the draft selections quiet and in isolated parts of the city. In Manhattan however, lotteries were placed in the heart of Irish tenement and shanty neighborhoods where the draft was most opposed.
In the ensuing New York Draft Riots, Nugent took command of troops and attempted to defend the city against the rioters. Despite issuing the cancellation of the draft, the riots continued for almost a week. His home on West 86th Street was looted and burned by the rioters during that time, his wife and children barely escaping from their home. Upon breaking into his house, furniture was destroyed and paintings of Nugent and Meagher were slashed, although Corcoran's was reportedly left untouched. 
On October 28, he was relieved of his post and succeeded by General William Hayes. He returning to active duty, he assumed command of Irish Brigade in November 1864, shortly after the death of Brigadier General Michael Corcoran, and was present at the battle of Battle of Spotsylvania, the Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaigns. As its last commanding officer, he and the Irish Brigade also marched in the victory parade held in Washington, D.C. following Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.
Later years.
Nugent was brevetted Brigadier General for distinguished leadership of the 69th Regiment on March 13, 1865. The veterans of the Irish Brigade were honorably discharged and mustered out three months later, Nugent remained in the regular US Army for the next twenty years. A formidable "Indian fighter" during the Great Plains Wars with the 13th and 24th Infantry Regiments. In 1879, he retired at the rank of major and resided in New York where he was involved in the Grand Army of the Republic, the War Veterans' Association of the 7th Regiment and an honorary member of The Old Guard. 
Death.
He became ill in his old age, complications arising from his wounds suffered at Fredericksburg, and remained bedridden for two months before his death at his McDonough Street home in Brooklyn. In accordance with his last wishes, he was buried at Cypress Hills National Cemetery.

USS Shoshone (ID-1760)

USS "Shoshone" (ID-1760) was a transport that served in the United States Navy in 1919.
"Shoshone" (ID-1760), first U.S. Navy ship of the name, was built in 1911 by Bremer Vulkan at Vegesack, Germany, and operated as a passenger-cargo ship by the Hamburg-America Line as SS "Wasgenwald". "Wasgenwald" was chartered for World War I service by the United States Army on 26 October 1917 from the Custom House, New York, and used as a depot collier with the name SS "Shoshone".
"Shoshone" was acquired by the U.S. Navy for use as a troop transport, assigned Id. No. 1760, armed, and placed in commission as USS "Shoshone" on 19 February 1919. She was attached to the Cruiser and Transport Force and, between February and July 1919, made two voyages to St. Nazaire, France, returning to the United States with American troops coming home from World War I service in Europe.
"Shoshone" was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 August 1919 and returned to her owner. As SS "Shoshone", she resumed commercial service, and around 1919 was renamed SS "Manoa".
Later career as s.s. "Manoa"
On 11 June 1921, Canada Steamship Lines introduced the 5,070-ton passenger and cargo ship MANOA (ii) into a new service between Montreal, Charlottetown and St John's that partly revived the Quebec Steamship Co's pre-1915 service between Montreal, Quebec and Gaspé. Because of the number of ports, the round voyage took 17 days, as “Canadian Railway & Marine World” announced that June: –
"Canada Steamship Lines will place its twin-screw steamship MANOA in service this summer, between Montreal, Quebec, and Gaspé, Que, Charlottetown, PEI, and St John's, Nfld, making seven round trips of about a fortnight each, leaving Montreal 11 and 28 June, 15, 2 July and 19 Aug, and 6 and 23 Sep... Her stateroom accommodation includes parlor rooms with baths en suite. 
"The route will be along the south shore of the St Lawrence, round the Gaspé peninsula, and Percé Rock, and thence via Charlottetown to St John s. The passenger rates will range as follows, according to accommodation, first-class fares including berths and meals. To Gaspé, one way, $30 to $70; steerage, $20; no round trip fares to Gaspé. To Charlottetown, one way, $45 to $85; round trip, $75 to $150; steerage, one way, $30. To St John's, one way, $70 to $100; round trip, $125 to $175; steer- age, one way, $40. There will be local rates between Gaspé and Charlottetown, Gaspé and St John's and Charlottetown and St John's. Children under 5, if occupying seats at table, will be charged 50c a meal, but no charge for passage or berth; children 5 years and under 12, half fare; and over 12 full fare. All fares exclusive of war tax." 
The Quebec Steamship Co's second ship of this name, that of a mythical golden city in British Guiana, the MANOA was a former Hamburg-American liner that had been taken by the Americans as a war prize. She could carry 100 passengers and had also run briefly in the Quebec Steamship Co's West Indies trade, between December 1919 and April 1920, before moving to the Compagnie Canadienne Transatlantique Ltée for a new service between Montreal and Le Havre, with Saint John as winter port. This joint venture of Canada Steamship Lines and Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, known also as the Fracanda Line, had been formed on 12 April 1919, with two ships from each partner carrying passengers. But it had operated only thirteen round voyages for passengers plus several voyages by chartered cargo ships before closing down in January 1921. 
By October, “Canadian Railway & Marine World” was reporting her acceptance on the St John's run: –
"Canada Steamship Lines' s.s. MANOA, which was to have made her last trip of the season from Montreal to Newfoundland, made additional sailings, Oct 13 and 29, and will make a third additional sailing, Nov 17, in response to requests from Newfoundland residents. The usual calls were made at Gaspé, Que, and Charlottetown, PEI. It is stated that the MANOA will make a series of special winter cruises to the south." 
She would remain the mainstay of the Montreal-St John's trade for the next five years. Whether the “special winter cruises” were to be run by Canada Steamship Lines or she was to be chartered back to Furness Withy & Co is not clear. Canada Steamship Lines had sold its Quebec Steamship subsidiary, for whom the MANOA had once operated, two seasons earlier and was no longer involved in the southern trades. 
After dropping the MANOA's Gaspé calls, Canada Steamship Lines was able to change her schedule from every 17 days to fortnightly fixed day of the week departures. These left Montreal every other Saturday at 4 pm for Charlottetown and St John's, with a return from St John's on the following Saturday. Calling at Charlottetown each way, she arrived at the other end of the line on Thursday, a 5-night voyage each way. CSL also sold these sailings as a 12-day cruise, from $90 inside or $135 in an outside cabin, and described it in its tourist brochure as follows: –
"A cruise in cool latitudes on the 6,000-ton (ocean type) s.s. MANOA. In this 12-day sea trip on the placid waters of the St Lawrence River and Gulf, you will find all the fascination of an ocean voyage – without any of the monotony and discomfort of a sea trip. A Boat Trip of 2,000 miles through the lower St Lawrence and Gulf of St Lawrence from Montreal to St John’s, Newfoundland, and return."
In 1922, these Gulf of St Lawrence cruises featured in a new brochure entitled “Two Wonderful Cruises” that also included the weekly Saguenay cruise of the CAPE ETERNITY. 
In 1923, Canada Steamship Lines lost $25,000 on its Newfoundland service but in 1924, as well as the MANOA, it ran the WINONA to St John's, giving it a weekly cargo service and fortnightly passenger service. At the end of that summer, however, the MANOA was replaced by the 2,816-ton Norwegian-flag cargo ship LISGAR COUNTY, brought in from the County Line. It also maintained a winter service from Saint John, New Brunswick, where it had been using the MAPLEDAWN in 1922. 
Canada Steamship Lines sold the MANOA to the Boston Iron & Metal Co in June 1926. That company in turn sold her back to her original owners, the Hamburg-American Line. Canada Steamship Lines meanwhile continued its Montreal-St John's service, but for cargo only, with winter sailings from Saint John, using chartered British freighters for the most part.

James Lore Murray

Major General James L. Murray (January 4, 1919 – May 9, 2004) was a United States Air Force officer and Engineering Project Manager for the XB-52 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
Biography.
General Murray started his Air Force career as an instructor; his 5,500 hours aloft spanned the era from Stearman PT-13 biplane trainers to the North American F-86 Sabre.
Notable amongst his students were members of the Tuskeegee Airmen 332d Fighter Group(99th Pursuit Group) and aviation author Ernest K. Gann, who referred to him as "a most skillful young Army pilot" in Fate Is the Hunter (page 213.)
From 1945 to 1948, he flew a Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando flying laboratory on 122 missions to gather icing data as part of the NASA Ames Research Center's effort to develop modern anti-ice systems.
As Chief of the Special Projects Branch of the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from 1948 to 1950, then-Major Murray led the effort to persuade aircraft manufacturers and operational Air Force units to accept the ejection seat as a safe and effective means of escape at high speed. The seat testing took place at Edwards Air Force Base located in Palmdale, California. The seat was attached to a sled that was connected to a stretch of rail road tracks. It was propelled by rockets at a high rate of speed which at the end launched a dummy from the seat with a parachute. When it came time to actually attempt an ejection from an aircraft in flight, Major Murray discovered the seat didn't fit properly in the cockpit of the aircraft that it was designed for, so ultimately the seat chassis was sent to Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles for modifications. Upon the corrections to the seat it was a "Go". Major Murray was flying in an aircraft next to the test plane. The test plane was flown by a close friend and test pilot. The test pilot began to steer the plane towards the ground and Major Murray witnessed the first ejection from the air. The test rail road tracks are still in existence today at Edwards A.F.B. as a reminder of the profound safety achievement and life saver for pilots.
General Murray survived two plane crashes in his lifetime. The first was before the ejection seat and took place when he was instructing a student that was one of The Tuskeegee Airmen. They were flying in a single-engine, two-seater trainer with a slide-back canopy over Florida. An oil hose broke and they lost engine power. Murray was able to take control of the plane and land it in a swampy field, causing severe damage to the engine and belly of the plane. They were not injured. The second plane crash was when General Murray was an executive for an aerospace company and was aboard the company's business jet as a passenger. The plane began its descent for landing on a very cold winter day in Michigan. General Murray, concerned about an ice buildup, looked out the window over the wing and noticed large sheets of ice on the wings. He quickly notified the pilots, but it was too late. General Murray then observed the ice breaking off of the wings and being sucked into the jet engine intakes. The engines shut down, and the plane had to make an emergency landing on a partially iced-over lake. Upon the plane crashing, it immediately burst into flames. General Murray quickly opened the door and ushered out the pilots and the other executives he was traveling with. The water was now covered in aircraft fuel. The fuel ignited, leaving General Murray no escape. His only option was to dive into the flames that were on top of the water. He suffered burns that were, fortunately, not serious. He said that swimming in the icy waters was the worst of it!
While he was the Engineering Project Manager for the XB-52 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from 1951–1952, Lt. Col. Murray worked with future Boeing chairman "T" A. Wilson and many others overseeing the development of the aircraft.
General Murray also worked for a division of Lockheed Skunk Works. He was assigned to the project development of "The Black Missile". This was the first missile that was undetectable by radar. It was being built in a large tan-colored hangar located on the north corner of The Burbank Airport, located in Burbank, California. The hangar was owned by Lockheed Skunk Works Division. It was accessed via San Fernando Rd. This hangar was not the typical hangar. It was larger than normal and heavily guarded. There were no signs of what was really going on there. General Murray worked there daily, entering the door on the west side of the hangar. He explained, upon entering the hangar there was an enormous black curtain that was drawn across the center of the hangar, splitting the work space. He stayed on his side and the other workers stayed on their side. They never saw each other or looked beyond the curtain. General Murray was advised that the other side of the curtain contained a highly classified development, as his project wasn't classified enough. Years later, General Murray discovered what was going on behind the curtain. He was told the first stealth aircraft was in its early stages of development and testing. Murray declined to speak about which aircraft. The hangar was torn down in the year 2002, closing another door to an amazing piece of history.
After being commissioned in the active Air Force Reserve in 1955, Murray eventually retired as a Major General in 1975 with what was known as a "Cosmic Secret" security clearance. He received the high honor of the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. General Murray held several executive positions in the aerospace industry, among them as vice-president of the C-5 division at the Douglas Aircraft Company, and a 20-year career as president/CEO of Teledyne/CAE, makers of the Boeing Harpoon and Tomahawk missile engine.
September 11, 2001, General Murray was 82 years of age. General Murray, a true patriot watching the aftermath of the attacks unfold on the television, told his youngest son, "If I weren't 82 years old, I would re-enlist and go fight!
General Murray died on May 9, 2004 at the age of 85. His dream was to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery amongst friends and heroes. He was interred in Section 54 of Arlington Cemetery.

Menon IV of Pharsalus

Menon (in Greek Mενων; died 321 BC) was a citizen of Pharsalus in Thessaly, and a man of great influence and reputation, took a prominent part in the Lamian war, and commanded the Thessalian cavalry in the battle with the Macedonians, in which Leonnatus was slain. Plutarch tells us that his services were highly valued by the confederates, and that he held a place in their estimation second only to Leosthenes, At the battle of Crannon (322 BC), he and Antiphilus, the Athenian, were defeated by Antipater and Craterus, though the Thessalian horse under his command maintained in the action its superiority over that of the enemy; and they felt themselves compelled to open a negotiation with the conquerors, which led to the dissolution of the Greek confederacy. But when Antipater was obliged to cross over to Asia against Perdiccas, the Aetolians renewed the war, and were zealously seconded in Thessaly by Menon, through whose influence it probably was that most of the Thessalian towns were induced to take part in the insurrection. Soon after, however, he was defeated by Polyperchon in a pitched battle, in which he himself was slain, 321 BC. His daughter Phthia he gave in marriage to Aeacides, king of Epirus, by whom she became the mother of Pyrrhus.

Portland railway line

The Portland railway line is a railway line in south-western Victoria, Australia. It runs from the main Western standard gauge line at Maroona through Hamilton to the port town of Portland.
History.
The line was built as (broad gauge) from Ararat to Maroona, Hamilton, Heywood and Portland in 1877. It was converted to standard gauge in 1995.
Freight operator Pacific National indefinitely suspended all rail services to the town of Portland in 2004, impacting local companies including Portland Aluminium, transport company Kalari, and freight broker Anchor Logistics. Portland container traffic was conveyed between Maroona and Portland on grain services twice a week, but Pacific National said that due to the drought there were no trains to attach the loading to. On the route the price differential between rail and road is $12.97 per tonne in rail's favour. Pacific National closed their Portland operations in March 2008, with GrainCorp leasing a limited number of locomotives and rolling stock from them, but favour transporting grain to the Port of Geelong instead.
In July 2008 the Victorian Government announced a $15 million upgrade to the line, raising maximum speeds to 80 kilometres an hour as they were previously. Australian Rail Track Corporation signed a 50-year lease to manage the line and will start the upgrade within months. The line was finally transferred from V/Line to ARTC on 22 March 2009.
In September 2008 it was announced that freight traffic would restart using the line, with operator El Zorro signing a multi-million deal with miner Iluka Resources to carry containerised mineral sands from Portland in the south-west to Melbourne, with Iluka saying rail transport was cheaper than road. The train continues to run today on an irregular basis. In March 2010 the State Government announced a $3.97 million grant for the construction of a rail loading facility alongside the Iluka Resources mineral sand separation plant (near Hamilton railway station) for the rail transport of heavy mineral concentrate extracted from the Iluka mine site at Ouyen via the standard gauge Murtoa - Hopetoun railway.
Grain trains on the line restarted with the 2010 harvest, with AWB Limited and their rail partner El Zorro using the GrainCorp terminal to load 26,250 tonnes of canola bound for Pakistan on 4 March 2010.
Branch lines.
A short lived branch line was opened from Dunkeld to Penshurst in 1890 but closed only eight years later.
A branch line was opened from Hamilton north to Cavendish between 1910 and 1920. This was connected to the Horsham - Balmoral railway in the 1920s, which itself connected back to the main Serviceton line. This line was closed south of Noradjuha, (just south of East Natimuk) in the 1970s. 
A branch line from Hamilton north-west to Coleraine was opened in 1882, being closed in 1977.
A branch line was opened between Hamilton and Koroit in the 1890, where it connected to the South West line via Warrnambool, but was closed in 1977.
A branch line was opened from Branxholme north-west to Casterton in 1884. This line was closed in 1977.
A branch line was opened from Heywood west to Mount Gambier in 1917. Service was suspended in 1995 due to the standardisation of the Maroona - Portland line. There are regular calls for the Heywood - Mount Gambier line to be standardised.
Services.
The only regular service on the line is the thrice weekly El Zorro containerised mineral sands train from Portland. The last passenger train between Ararat and Portland was on 12 September 1981, operated by a DRC railcar. A new passenger station at Portland had been officially opened on 29 June 1968.

Economic graph

The social science of economics makes extensive use graphs to better illustrate the economic principles and trends it is attempting to explain. Those graphs have specific qualities that are not often found (or are not often found in such combinations) in other sciences.
A common and specific example is the supply-and-demand graph shown at right. This graph shows supply and demand as opposing curves, and the intersection between those curves determines the equilibrium price. An alteration of either supply or demand is shown by displacing the curve to either the left (a decrease in quantity demanded or supplied) or to the right (an increase in quantity demanded or supplied); this shift results in new equilibrium price and quantity. 
Economic graphs are presented only in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane when the variables conceptually can only take on non-negative values (such as the quantity of a product that is produced). Even though the axes refer to numerical variables, specific values are often not introduced if a conceptual point is being made that would apply to any numerical examples.
More generally, there is usually some mathematical model underlying any given economic graph. For instance, the commonly used supply-and-demand graph has its underpinnings in general price theory—a highly mathematical discipline.
Choice of axes for dependent and independent variables.
In most mathematical contexts, the independent variable is placed on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis. For example, if "f"("x") is plotted against "x", conventionally "x" is plotted horizontally and the value of the function is plotted vertically. This placement is often, but not always, reversed in economic graphs. For example, in the supply-demand graph at the top of this page, the independent variable (price) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded), whose value depends on price, is plotted horizontally.
However, when time is the independent variable, and values of some other variable are plotted as a function of time, normally the independent variable time is plotted horizontally, as in the line graph to the right.
Yet other graphs may have one curve for which the independent variable is plotted horizontally and another curve for which the independent variable is plotted vertically. For example, in the IS-LM graph shown here, the IS curve shows the amount of the dependent variable spending ("Y") as a function of the independent variable the interest rate ("i"), while the LM curve shows the value of the dependent variable, the interest rate, that equilibrates the money market as a function of the independent variable income (which equals expenditure on an economy-wide basis in equilibrium). Since the two different markets (the goods market and the money market) take as given different independent variables and determine by their functioning different dependent variables, necessarily one curve has its independent variable plotted horizontally and the other vertically.

Max Hardcore

Max Hardcore (born Paul F. Little; August 10, 1956) is a male pornographic actor, producer, and director. He rose to prominence in 1992 with the film series "The Anal Adventures of Max Hardcore". His work has been classified as gonzo pornography and described as "testing the limits of acceptability". His company, Max World Entertainment, was headquartered in Altadena, California.
Nature of content.
Max Hardcore's films generally consist of sexual acts executed by himself, with women who act like underage girls or their upset mothers, with an emphasis on anal sex. All of the actresses used in Little's movies are over the legal age of 18; however, they frequently dress and act in a way as to suggest that they are younger, possibly under the age of consent. In his film "Max Extreme 4", an actress, Regan Star, stated during one verbal exchange that she was 12 years old; similarly, in his film "Max Extreme Schoolgirls 6", actress Mya Mason stated during one verbal exchange that she was 12 years old.
The sexual situations depicted in Max Hardcore's films frequently include acts such as urinating on his female co-stars, fisting them, or inserting specula into their anuses or vaginas and widening them to extreme degree, as well as scenes wherein he forces them to vomit or blow snot into their mouths or on themselves. Films by Max Hardcore often depict their director and star inflicting apparent pain and humiliation on his co-stars.
Hardcore calls his own material "vile and crazy" and considers that he has been influential on the porn industry, spawning many imitators.
Writer Susannah Breslin, reviewing Hardcore's work, has commented: "In Max Hardcore movies – "Pure Max", "Hardcore Schoolgirls", "Don't Fuck Up My Mommy!" – the women are verbally and physically degraded in an unprecedented myriad of ways." The treatment by Hardcore of his female co-stars has been described by several critics as occasionally abusive. The tone of Hardcore's work has been considered misogynistic. His films and alleged work methods have reportedly made him relatively unpopular in the porn industry.
Prosecutions.
Based on "Max Extreme 4", the city of Los Angeles in 1998 charged him with child pornography and distribution of obscenity. The fact that the actress was over the age of 18 was not disputed; they brought charges based solely on the fact that the actress was portraying a character who was underage. Just before the case was brought to trial in 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (in "Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition") that the statute prohibiting adults from portraying children in films and books was unconstitutional. Based on this ruling, the child pornography charges against Little were dismissed. The misdemeanor charge of distribution of obscenity was retained, but the jury failed to reach a verdict. An additional obscenity charge was subsequently levied against him by L.A., again resulting in a hung jury. Little commented after the trial that it "was a frivolous waste of public resources."
On October 5, 2005, while Little was in Barcelona to attend an international FICEB Erotic Expo, the offices of Max World Entertainment were raided by the FBI. Five video titles and the office's computer servers were seized, ostensibly for research toward a federal obscenity indictment or a charge related to the 2257 record-keeping law.
In the execution of the search warrant, one officer accidentally discharged a weapon into the floor of an upstairs office, as the housekeeper was being detained below. No one was injured.
After the FBI raid, Little released the following statement:
In 2007, Little and his company, Max World Entertainment, Inc., were indicted by the United States Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section with five counts of transporting obscene matter by use of an interactive computer service and five counts of mailing obscene matter, relating to five movies showing fisting, urination and vomiting. Little was subsequently found guilty on all charges, and sentenced to 46 months in prison. On appeal, the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, Georgia upheld the conviction, but remanded his sentence. Little began serving his sentence on January 29, 2009.
The jury ordered the internet domain www.MaxHardcore.com to be forfeited but declined to forfeit Little's house in Altadena, California.
Little was originally held at Federal Correctional Institution, La Tuna in Anthony, Texas, a low security correctional facility for men. He was transferred to the management of the Community Corrections Management, Long Beach facility on January 21, 2011 in preparation for his release, and served the final five months of his sentence under house arrest. He is Federal Bureau of Prisons number 44902-112 and was released on July 19, 2011.
Since he has been out of prison, Max stated in a February 2012 interview that he "wants to do good in the world", and has now gone back into the porn industry.

Popular (The Veronicas song)

"Popular" is a song recorded by Australian duo The Veronicas for their second studio album "Hook Me Up" (2007). Produced by Toby Gad, it was released as the album's final single on 11 October 2008 as a digital download. Written by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Lisa Origliasso and Jessica Origliasso, together with Beni Barca and Gad, it was recorded in Los Angeles, California. The electropop track pokes fun at people with privileged lifestyles.
"Popular" received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the fun lyrics and named it a highlight of the album. The recording was released to radio in the week of 12 October 2008, and peaked at number eleven on the Australian Airplay Charts.
Writing and inspiration.
"Popular" was written by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Jessica Origliasso and Lisa Origliasso, together with Beni Barca and Toby Gad. It was recorded at Jessica and Lisa's living room in Los Angeles, California, with Gad producing the track. In an interview with Cameron Adams of "Herald Sun" Lisa elaborated on the song's subject matter: "We wanted something different. We wanted to take the piss out of celebrity life. We thought it was hysterical." When asked about the rapped verses in the recording, Jessica replied, "I'm rapping! I'm doing it for all the unrhythmic white chicks in Australia! With a really thick Australian accent!"
Reception.
Emily Mackay of "NME" called "Popular" "plain old up-yours fun", while K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic said the Australian accent was used to "excellent effect" in the rapped verses. Ben Norman of About.com found the lyrics "humorous" and named the track one of his favourites from the album, calling it: "Upbeat, very poppy, but eventually the complete inanity of it grew on me... Don't discount this song due to the extreme contrast it poses to the rest of the disc or their previous material. Give it a shot, you might just like it." Similarly, Nick Levine of Digital Spy declared "Popular", along with "Untouched" and "This Is How It Feels", as one of the highlights on the album. Evan Sawdey of "PopMatters" was impressed with the song which made for a "glorious" end to "Hook Me Up", an album he felt was full of hooks. He said: "the gloriously trashy “Popular” seems fueled entirely by dance floor sweat, being both ridiculous and confident in equal measure."
David James Young of Sputnikmusic compared "Popular" to an inbred lovechild of Peaches and Princess Superstar, saying: "what can be said about this one? Basically, if Peaches went out and got completely hammered with Princess Superstar and they managed to have some kind of inbred lovechild with “Best Damn Thing”-era Avril Lavigne as the midwife, it would probably come out sounding something like this. And believe me, this is definitely not a compliment. Talking about the song, the girls say that the song is “taking the piss out of famous people”. However, in a similar vein to Good Charlotte atrocity “I Just Wanna Live”, you simply cannot tell and it comes off as vain and cheap."
The recording is the only song of The Veronicas to date not to chart within the top one hundred of the ARIA Singles Chart. It peaked at number eleven on the Australian Airplay Chart.

Canadian federal election, 2011

The 2011 Canadian federal election (formally the 41st Canadian general election) was held Monday, May 2, 2011, to elect members to the House of Commons of the 41st Canadian Parliament.
The writs of election for the 2011 election were issued by Governor General David Johnston on March 26. Prime Minister Stephen Harper advised the Governor General to dissolve parliament after the House of Commons passed a motion of non-confidence against the government, finding it to be in contempt of parliament. A few days before, the three opposition parties had rejected the government's proposed budget.
The Conservative Party remained in power, increasing their seat count from a minority to a majority government. The Liberal Party won the fewest seats in their history, and party leader Michael Ignatieff was defeated in his riding. The Bloc Québécois lost official party status for the first time since contesting general elections in 1993. Party leader Gilles Duceppe was defeated in his riding and subsequently resigned as leader. The New Democratic Party won the largest number of seats in their history, enabling them to form the Official Opposition for the first time. The Green Party elected its first member to the House of Commons with its leader, Elizabeth May, becoming MP for Saanich—Gulf Islands.
Background.
The 2008 federal election resulted in the continuation of the incumbent Conservative minority government, headed by Stephen Harper. The 40th Parliament was marked by two controversial prorogations: the first in December 2008 which ended an attempted opposition coalition, and the second a year following, which prompted public protests. Following the first prorogation, Ignatieff and the Liberal Party provided support for the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. On August 31, 2009, the Liberals withdrew their backing but the NDP under Jack Layton abstained and the Conservatives survived the confidence motion.
Ignatieff's attempt to force a September 2009 election was reported as a miscalculation, as polls showed that most Canadians did not want another election. Ignatieff's popularity as well as that of the Liberals dropped off considerably immediately afterwards.
In 2011, Elections Canada laid charges against the Conservative Party, alleging contraventions of the Canada Elections Act five years earlier. This issue, along with the Bloc Québécois announcing its intention to vote against the budget, unless it contained numerous changes including $2 billion in compensation to Quebec for harmonizing PST and GST and funding for a new NHL arena in Quebec City, increased the speculation that there would be an election called soon as the Conservatives rejected the Bloc demands as "blackmail".
On March 9, 2011, Speaker of the House of Commons Peter Milliken ruled that Bev Oda, a minister of the Crown, and, separately, the Cabinet itself could both possibly be in contempt of parliament, the latter for its ongoing refusal to meet opposition requests for details of proposed bills and their cost estimates. Milliken directed both matters to committee and set as the deadline for its report March 21, 2011, one day before the budget was to be tabled. The committee found the government to be in contempt of Parliament. The vote divided along party lines, with the governing but minority Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) opposing the finding and issuing a dissenting report. After the committee released its findings, opposition leader and head of the Liberal Party Michael Ignatieff proposed a motion of no confidence against the Crown-in-Council and, on March 25, 2011, the House of Commons voted on the motion, the majority agreeing, by a margin of 156 to 145, with the committee's conclusions. A cabinet being found in contempt of parliament is without precedent in Canada or any other Commonwealth country. Earlier that week, all three opposition parties had indicated that they would oppose the government's budget; the NDP said that the concessions that the Conservatives made did not go far enough.

With an overall voter turnout of 61.4%, the Conservative Party remained in power, moving from a minority to a majority government by winning 166 of the 308 seats. The New Democratic Party won the largest number of seats in their history, including a large majority of seats in Quebec (where they had previously only ever elected two candidates) and formed the Official Opposition for the first time. The Liberal Party won the fewest seats in their history and party leader Michael Ignatieff was defeated in his own riding. The Bloc Québécois, which had always won at least a majority of seats in Quebec in every election of their existence, lost nearly all their seats, and thus also their official party status, including the seat of their leader Gilles Duceppe. Green Party leader Elizabeth May became the first Member of Parliament elected to represent the party.
Recounts.
Elections Canada ordered three judicial recounts, and an elector initiated a fourth. The Canada Elections Act states that "a judicial recount is required when the difference in votes between the first- and second-place candidates is less than one one-thousandth of the total votes cast in a riding," and allows an elector or candidate in any riding to approach a judge and request a recount regardless of the final result. In all four ridings, Etobicoke Centre, Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, Nipissing—Timiskaming, and Winnipeg North, the validated result was confirmed:
Opposition party leadership changes.
Ignatieff announced on May 3, 2011, that he would step down as leader of the Liberal Party when it chooses his successor. Ignatieff took a teaching position at the University of Toronto after his defeat in Etobicoke—Lakeshore. He will teach classes in the law faculty, the department of political science, the Munk School of Global Affairs and the School of Public Policy and Governance. Ignatieff stated that "The life that I like the best is teaching. It’s the end of my life as a politician". Bob Rae, Liberal MP for Toronto Centre and former Premier of Ontario (1990 to 1995, as a New Democrat), subsequently became interim leader of the Liberal Party, with a Liberal leadership election to take place April 14, 2013, during which Justin Trudeau was chosen as leader.
Duceppe resigned as Bloc Québécois leader on election night following his defeat. Louis Plamondon, MP for Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour and Dean of the House, subsequently became interim parliamentary leader of the Bloc. Former MP Daniel Paillé, who lost his seat in the election, won the Bloc leadership election to succeed Duceppe on December 11, 2011.
On July 25, 2011, Jack Layton took a leave of absence to fight a newly diagnosed cancer. Nycole Turmel, former union leader and newly elected MP for Hull—Aylmer, was named interim leader of the New Democratic Party. On August 22, Layton died. Turmel became opposition leader. A leadership election was held on March 24, 2012 and Thomas Mulcair was elected leader of the New Democratic Party.
Controversies.
The losing parties in the Berthier—Maskinongé riding claimed that the nomination papers for Ruth Ellen Brosseau, the newly elected NDP Member of Parliament for the riding, had irregularities. Some of the alleged irregularities include writing an address instead of signing, missing signatures, people thinking they were signing a petition for the NDP to name a candidate in the riding and one person not remembering that he signed her nomination papers even though he admitted that the signature looks like his. The NDP denied the allegations. Elections Canada has insisted that Brosseau's nomination papers are legitimate. Elections Canada stated that "The decision to overturn or uphold the results is at the discretion of the courts and not Elections Canada".
Voter suppression scandal.
In early 2012, allegations of voter suppression during the election burst onto the scene, starting the robocall scandal. Elections Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are investigating claims that robocalls were used in an attempt to dissuade voters from casting their ballot by telling them their poll stations had changed location. While the Elections Canada investigation initially focused on calls sent into Guelph amidst nationwide complaints, the investigation has continued to expand in scope and continues to examine complaints in other ridings across the country. Reports of fraudulent automated or live calls targeting opposition supporters have been published in 100 ridings and Elections Canada has acknowledged it is investigating telephone election fraud complaints in 247 of Canada's 308 federal ridings.
On March 27, 2012 the Council of Canadians announced that they had launched a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Canada to ask for by-elections to be ordered in seven ridings where complaints were received and where Conservatives had won by slim margins. The ridings named are Don Valley East, Winnipeg South Centre, Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, Vancouver Island North, Yukon, Nipissing-Timiskaming and Elmwood-Transcona. The case was heard over two weeks starting December 9, 2012. Justice Richard G. Mosley ruled in May 2013 that fraud occurred in Guelph and that voting irregularities and misconduct occurred in all six of the contested ridings, but that it was not significant enough to warrant overturn the election results. The judge also ruled that the mostly likely source of the fraud was the Conservative Party of Canada's CIMS database, although he concluded that there was no evidence that its use was approved by the CPC.
In April 2013, the first criminal charge in the matter was laid on Michael Sona, a former Conservative staffer who was the communications officer and official Ottawa liaison for the Guelph Conservative campaign.
Riding of Vaughan.
In a further scandal, Elections Canada has been called on to investigate the finances of Associate Minister of National Defence Julian Fantino's election finances, after three former Conservative riding executives from Vaughan signed affidavits alleging impropriety in Fantino's 2010 and 2011 election campaigns. They allege there is a second, secret, illegal bank account containing $300,000.
Issues.
Crime and law enforcement.
Internet surveillance and warrant-less wiretapping.
The Conservatives promised to re-introduce Internet surveillance legislation that they were not able to pass, and bundle it with the rest of their crime bills. They said they plan to fast track the legislation within 100 days after taking office.
Long gun registry.
Harper pledged to scrap the long-gun registry.
Crime strategies.
The Conservative platform included a promise to consolidate twelve crime bills into at least one omnibus bill and pass it within 100 days of forming a majority government. The bills included within that list would crack down on organized drug crime, end house arrest for violent criminals and establish tougher sentences and mandatory jail time for sexual offences against children. The opposition parties claimed the crime bills were not costed fully, and the opposition parties countered that this would create a US style system of prisons. The Conservatives have not released the costs for expanding the prison system. The other parties state that more focus should be given on crime prevention, so that it doesn't happen in the first place. The New Democratic Party (NDP) stated that their promise to hire 2,500 more police officers to patrol the streets, will help in preventing crime from occurring in the first place.
Defence policy.
The Conservatives plan to purchase 65 F-35 Lightning II jet fighters. Stating "Our defence policy is broken" the NDP announced that they would prioritize investment in naval ships over new fighter jets. The NDP stated that this would be a good opportunity to keep shipbuilding expertise and jobs in Canada.
Economy and fiscal policy.
Balanced budget and recession.
Conservatives argued that they steered the economy through the 2007-2010 global financial crisis, and promised to eliminate the budget deficit by 2014–15. Former Prime Minister Paul Martin, campaigning for the Liberals, challenged assertions, noting that his Liberal government left a $13 billion budget surplus, before the Conservatives took power. In 2010, Paul Martin had been invited to the prestigious Global ARC conference to discuss that elimination of the Canadian government deficit. Martin also claimed that when he was Finance minister working under Jean Chretien, his blocking of proposed bank mergers is what actually sheltered Canada from the worst effects of the recession. The New Democratic Party (NDP) released its platform promising a balanced budget in four years. After the NDP surge, the Liberals called the NDP platform "science fiction" stating it contains over $30 billion in new spending derived from sources that are not credible, and that implementing a cap and trade system that would take years to realize rather than provide the in-year contributions as claimed.
Corporate tax cuts and job creation strategy.
The Conservatives stated that their plan to cut corporate taxes from 16.5% to 15%, will create more jobs. Harper stated that an increase in corporate taxes will create job losses across Canada. Layton countered by saying currently the jobs are shipped overseas, and pledged a $4,500 job creation tax credit to all businesses per new hire. Layton further went to say that small business are the ones creating more jobs, thus he promised to lower the tax rate for small business from 11% to 9%. He then went on to say the big business are using the corporate tax cuts by providing their CEOs with big bonuses, and thus pledged to increase their tax rate to 19.5%. The Liberals on the other hand, will raise the rate to 18%, stating that it will be competitive but not excessively low.
Increasing Canada Pension Plan.
The NDP promised a gradual doubling of Canada Pension Plan and QPP benefits, in conjunction with the provinces, with an increase in payroll deductions of as much as 2.5 per cent.
HST referendum in BC.
If BC voters were to reject the Harmonized Sales Tax in the upcoming referendum, the NDP promised to ensure that the penalties to be imposed by Ottawa on the HST agreement will be cancelled.
Personal taxation.
Conservatives promised income splitting for tax purposes for families with children to be implemented once the budget is balanced in 2013.
Electoral reform and political honesty.
Political honesty.
The New Democratic Party stated that both the Conservatives and the Liberals cannot be trusted. The NDP accused the Conservatives of creating "Liberal-style scandals" and accused the Liberals of flip-flopping on issues such as corporate tax cuts, and the Afghanistan mission. Throughout the election various polls had shown the political honesty issue to be low on the list of priorities for voters. Post-media conducted a survey that found health care, the economy, taxes and jobs all more important to Canadians. Further, half of voters identified Harper as the best suited to be Prime Minister followed by Layton with one third support and Ignatieff with less than twenty percent support. On the question of a hidden agenda, Ignatieff is viewed by three times more of those polled to have a hidden agenda than Harper.
Political financing.
Conservatives pledged to phase-out per-vote subsidy over two years, with its eventual cancellation.
Senate.
Stephen Harper promised Senate reform without changing the constitution. The NDP pledged to abolish the Senate, stating it is a waste of tax revenues and a form of patronage.
General.
Possible left-wing coalition.
The Conservatives asserted that the Liberals would form a coalition with the more left-leaning NDP and Bloc Québécois, despite repeated claims by the Liberals and NDP to the contrary.
Promised government programs.
Newfoundland hydroelectric project and Quebec's HST.
Conservatives, New Democrats and Liberals promised $4.2 billion in loan guarantees to support the Lower Churchill River power project. Due to outcry from Quebec over the pledge to provide loan guarantees for the Lower Churchill project, the Conservatives promise Quebec a $2.2 billion transfer to ease the Quebec Sales Tax to Harmonized Sales Tax transition.
Post-secondary education.
Liberals promised a "Learning Passport" for high school students seeking post-secondary education. The NDP's plan is to reduce the tuition fees, by increasing transfer payments to the Provinces.
Immigration Fairness Commissioner.
Liberals proposed the establishment of an "Immigration Fairness Commissioner" to provide oversight on the entry of immigrants with professional qualifications (doctors, engineers, etc.), and to increase the number of family reunification visas.
Health care.
Health care – The NDP pledged to train 1,200 more doctors and 6,000 more nurses. All parties promised to continue to increase healthcare transfers to provinces by 6% annually.
Government regulations.
Improved internet and usage based billing.
The New Democratic Party (NDP) promised a ban on all forms of usage based billing by ISPs, and enshrine net neutrality in law, which would prevent bandwidth throttling. The Liberals promised net neutrality as well as "functional separation" with regards to usage based billing as well as enshrining net neutrality in law, which would prevent bandwidth throttling. Almost all of the established parties, with the exception of the Conservatives, outlined polices that they claim will improve Canadian Internet access.
Cap on credit card interest rates.
The NDP promised to cap credit card rates at five percentage points above the Bank of Canada's prime interest rate.
Election campaign.
Controversies and gaffes.
A number of controversies took place during the election campaign.
Leaders' debates.
The English- and French-language debates took place on April 12 and 13 respectively.
On March 29, the consortium of broadcasters playing host to the debates (the CBC, CTV, Global, Radio-Canada and TVA) announced that it would only invite the leaders of the four recognized parties in the House of Commons, namely, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic (NDP). Therefore the Green Party was excluded, despite earning 6.8 per cent of the popular vote in the 2008 federal election.
On March 30, Stephen Harper challenged Michael Ignatieff to a one-on-one televised debate. Although Ignatieff accepted the challenge, this was opposed by the other opposition parties. The idea was later rejected by the broadcast consortium and cancelled.
On April 1, comedian Rick Mercer suggested over Twitter hosting a one-on-one debate between Stephen Harper and Michael Ignatieff at Toronto's Massey Hall. He later added he would donate $50,000 to the charities of their choosing if they were willing to participate. Ignatieff immediately accepted the challenge and named the Alzheimer Society as his charity of choice, as his mother succumbed to Alzheimer's disease in 1992. Harper did not respond to the challenge.
In an interview with "The Globe and Mail" published on April 1, Troy Reeb, the broadcast consortium chairman, discussed the process behind setting up the leaders' debates and the rationale for various decisions made, including the decision to exclude the Green Party's leader Elizabeth May.
On April 5, the Federal Court rejected the Green Party's request for an expedited hearing on the matter prior to the scheduled debates.
On April 10, the date of the French leaders debate was changed from April 14 to April 13 due to worries of broadcasting conflicts with the NHL playoffs scheduled for April 14. Also on April 10, Elizabeth May participated in a panel interview on CHCH-TV in Hamilton, which she was invited to attend, as were the leaders of the Bloc, Liberals, New Democrats and Conservatives, by Channel Zero, whose president was disappointed by May's exclusion from the leaders' debates.
Small parties public forum.
A joint press conference and public forum was staged by 11 of the 18 registered parties and one unregistered party on April 23, 2011, at York University. Forum organizers invited the leaders from all registered political parties who do not have seats in parliament. Parties were able to explain their platforms and responded to questions from the audience. As a forum, the goal was an inter-party discussion of major issues, however some debate did occur.
Participants in the forum were the Animal Alliance Environmental Voters, the Canadian Action Party, the Christian Heritage Party, the Communist Party, the First Peoples National, the Libertarian Party, the Marijuana Party, the Marxist-Leninist Party, the Rhinoceros Party, and the Pirate Party.
Green Party Leader Elizabeth May refused to participate in the forum claiming they are not one of "the small, fringe parties."
Opinion polls.
New Democratic Party surge.
In the week before the leaders debate, on April 8, a poll showed the New Democratic Party (NDP) support at 13.2%.
A reversal of fortune began on April 16, when an Angus Reid poll indicated a tie in support for the NDP and the Liberals, both polling at 25%. The New Democrats' poll numbers then moved significantly ahead of the Liberals and slightly or moderately behind the Conservatives.
The surge began in Quebec, with the NDP surprising many observers by surpassing the previously front-running Bloc in Quebec. In the entirety of Canada, the NDP surged past the Liberals to take the second place behind the Conservatives; in Quebec, the NDP took first place. The NDP surge became the dominant narrative of the last week of the campaign, as other parties turned their attacks on the party. Ruth Ellen Brosseau, the NDP candidate in Berthier—Maskinongé, won despite not running a campaign and having a holiday in Las Vegas. The NDP's rise in popularity was nicknamed "Orange Crush", an allusion to the soft drink with the same name and the party's colour.
Spending limits.
The calculation for a party's spending limit is based on the number of candidates a party is running and the number of voters in each riding where there is a candidate. Parties are allowed to spend 70 cents for each one of those voters. Local candidates were allowed to spend $2.07 for each of the first 15,000 electors, $1.04 for each of the next 10,000 and 52 cents for the remaining electors.
The parties with the highest spending limits were:
The parties with the lowest spending limits were:
Endorsements.
Most major newspapers endorsed the Conservatives, and none solely endorsed the Liberals or Greens. However Canada's highest circulated newspaper, the "Toronto Star", advised to vote against the Conservatives.
Candidates by party.

USNS Potomac (T-AO-181)

The fifth USNS "Potomac" (T-AO-181) was a United States Navy oiler in non-commissioned service with the Military Sea Transportation Service, later Military Sealift Command, from 1976 to 1983.
"Potomac", sixth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, was laid down as SS "Shenandoah" at Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Chester, Pennsylvania, on 1 March 1964 and launched on 10 October 1964. She was built using the 200-foot (61 m) salvaged stern section of the oiler USNS "Potomac" (T-AO-150) -- a ship which had been destroyed by a fire on 26 September 1961—to which a new forward section was added. She was the first ship equipped with an offshore petroleum discharge system (OPDS), allowing her to supply petroleum products to forces ashore by pumping it directly over the shore instead of having to deliver it in a port.
The U.S. Navy acquired "Shenandoah" on 10 October 1964, and delivered her to Keystone Shipping Company on 11 December 1965. Keystone Shipping then chartered the ship to the Navy's Military Seas Transportation Service (MSTS), which later became the Military Sealift Command (MSC), on a bareboat basis, with Keystone Shipping providing the ship and MSTS providing crew and operating expenses. "Shenandoah" operated with a civilian crew in this manner until the MSC purchased her on 12 January 1976. The Navy then designated the ship T-AO-181 and renamed her USNS "Potomac", making her the sixth U.S. Navy ship of the name.
In MSC service, "Potomac" continued to operate with a civilian crew. The oiler transported bulk petroleum products to the United States armed forces deployed overseas in the Pacific, and on 30 September 1978 was reclassified as a transport oiler and redesignated T-AOT-181.
On 26 September 1983, "Potomac" was taken out of MSC service and on 4 March 1984 was transferred to the Ready Reserve Force (RRF), becoming SS "Potomac".
In 1990, "Potomac", operated by Bay Ship Management, owned by the Maritime Administration, and under charter to the Navy, was transferred to the Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) and spent more than 10 years stationed at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. During this time she participated in sorties, exercises, and training activities, assisted in a humanitarian food relief effort for Rwanda, assisted forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and earned the U.S. Navy's "E" for excellence ship award during convoy exercises in the Indian Ocean. 
SS "Potomac" left Diego Garcia and the MPF in 2000 and was transferred back to the RRF. She was transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Beaumont, Texas. In 2006 she was downrated from the Ready Reserve Force and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

<doc id="19769447" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19769447" title="Law of the land">
Law of the land

The phrase law of the land is a legal term, equivalent to the Latin "lex terrae" (or "legem terrae" in the accusative case). It refers to all of the laws in force within a country or region, including both statute law and common law.
Use in the Magna Carta.
In the year 1297 this term was used in the Magna Carta. Perhaps the most famous clause of Magna Carta states:
No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the "Law of the Land".
This is sometimes called the "law of the land clause".
Emulation of the Magna Carta.
Half a millennium later, following the American Revolution, legislators looked to Magna Carta for inspiration, and emulated some of Magna Carta's language. Versions of it can be found in the Virginia Constitution of 1776, the North Carolina Constitution of 1776, the Delaware Constitution of 1776, the Maryland Constitution of 1776, the New York Constitution of 1777, the South Carolina Constitution of 1778, the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, and the New Hampshire Constitution of 1784.
In 1787, the Continental Congress adopted the Northwest Ordinance for governance of areas in the United States outside of the individual states. Congress wrote: "No man shall be deprived of his liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land."
Use in the United States Constitution.
This term was used in 1787 to write the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. The Supremacy Clause states: "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme "Law of the land"..." The term was not used in the U.S. Constitution to emulate Magna Carta, and instead an equivalent (due process) phraseology was used.
Meaning and interpretation.
This term has been the subject of numerous scholarly works and judicial decisions over the years. The Latin term is "lex terrae", or "legem terrae" in the accusative case (i.e. when the term is being used as the object in a sentence).
What it includes.
English jurists, writing of "legem terrae" in reference to the Magna Carta, stated that this term embraces all laws that are in force for the time being within a jurisdiction. For example, Edward Coke, commenting upon Magna Carta, wrote in 1606: "no man be taken or imprisoned but per "legem terrae", that is, by the common law, statute law, or custom of England." Likewise, Justice Powys of the King's Bench wrote in 1704: "lex terrae is not confined to the common law, but takes in all the other laws, which are in force in this realm; as the civil and canon law..."
British Chief Justice John Fineux stated in 1519 that "the Law of God and the Law of the Land are all one" in the sense that they both protect the public good. British Chief Justice John Vaughan further explained in 1677 that whenever the law of the land declares by a legislative act what divine law is, then the courts must consider that legislation to be correct.
Without reference to Magna Carta, the term appears in the Year Books, where William Bereford, Justice of the Common Pleas, is recorded as saying in 1308 that the then-existing law of the land required one to be summoned by two summoners.
Equivalence to due process.
Lord Coke also equated this term to due process of law: "But by the Law of the Land. For the true sense and exposition of these words, see the Statute of 37 Edw. 3 cap. 8 where the words, by the law of the Land, are rendered, without due process of Law..."
How it changes.
In eighteenth-century England, William Blackstone wrote that the law of the land "depends not upon the arbitrary will of any judge; but is permanent, fixed, and unchangeable, unless by authority of parliament... Not only the substantial part, or judicial decisions, of the law, but also the formal part, or method of proceeding, cannot be altered but by parliament."

1972–73 Ottawa Nationals season

The 1972–73 Ottawa Nationals season was the Nationals' only season, as they were one of the original teams in the newly created WHA. The Nationals played most of the season in Ottawa, but transferred their playoff games to Toronto. Due to low attendance in Ottawa, an arena lease dispute and much better attendance in their two playoff games in Toronto, where they averaged over 5000 fans per game, the Nationals relocated to Toronto permanently beginning in the next season, and the club was renamed the Toronto Toros.
Offseason.
The Nationals were originally owned by Doug Michel, with rumours he would place the team in either Hamilton or Toronto, however, and he placed the club in Ottawa. After the team was placed to play in Ottawa, Nick Trbovich became the majority owner, with Michel running hockey operations. The club was placed in the six team Eastern Division, with the top four clubs earning a playoff berth.
The Nationals hired former Toronto Maple Leaf Billy Harris to coach the team. Ottawa's most significant signing was Wayne Carleton, who had previously played with the Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins and California Golden Seals in the NHL.
Regular season.
The first game in WHA history was a match between the Nationals and the Alberta Oilers at the Civic Centre, which Alberta won 7-4, on October 11, 1972. Ottawa recorded their first victory in their fourth game, a 6-2 decision over the Chicago Cougars. The Nationals reached a season high two games over .500 with a 12-10-1 record, before falling into a long slump in which the club won only seven games in their next 31, and dropped into last place in the Eastern Division. Ottawa would play very good hockey down the stretch, winning two-thirds of its remaining games, and finished the season at 35-39-4, earning 74 points and the fourth and final playoff position.
Attendance was an issue for the club, as they drew an average of just over 3000 fans per game, competing against the very popular Ottawa 67's OHA team.
Offensively, Ottawa was led by Carleton, who scored a team high 42 goals and 49 assists for 91 points, which ranked him tenth in league scoring. Twenty year old Gavin Kirk earned 68 points in 78 games, while Bob Charlebois earned 64 points. Brian Gibbons had 42 points to lead the team's defencemen, while Rick Cunningham had a team high 121 penalty minutes.
In goal, Gilles Gratton had the majority of playing time, winning 25 games and posting a 3.71 GAA. Veteran Les Binkley backed him up, earning 10 wins and a GAA of 3.72.
Playoffs.
The Nationals would open the playoffs with a best of seven series against the New England Whalers, who had a league high 94 points. The series opened up with two games in New England, and the Whalers took advantage of their home ice, defeating Ottawa 6-3 and 4-3 to take a two game series lead. The series moved to Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, as the Nationals ownership decided to move their playoff games from Ottawa due to attendance problems. The Nationals use their "home ice" advantage in the third game, defeating the Whalers 4-2 to get back into the series, however, New England easily defeated Ottawa in the fourth game 7-3 to take a 3-1 series lead. The Whalers would close out the series in the fifth game back in New England, as they beat Ottawa 5-4 in overtime to eliminate the Nationals.

Meno (general)

Meno (; Greek: Mένων, "Menon"; c. 423 – c. 400 BC), son of Alexidemus, was an ancient Thessalian political figure. Probably from Pharsalus, he is famous both for the eponymous dialogue written by Plato in which he features and his role among the generals killed by Artaxerxes at the Battle of Cunaxa, as depicted in Xenophon's "Anabasis".
Biography.
Meno is reported, by both Xenophon and Plato, to have been attractive and in the bloom of youth and was quite young at his death. He had many lovers, including Aristippus of Larissa, Tharypas, and Ariaeus the Persian. Xenophon gives a strongly hostile description of Meno as a disreputable, ambitious and dishonest youth, willing to commit any injustice for advancement, though Meno's actions in the "Anabasis" may not entirely merit such a negative portrait.
Meno while still young was given command of 1000 hoplites and 5000 peltasts from Thessaly as hired by Aristippus to assist Cyrus the Younger in his attempt to seize the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes. Artaxerxes was made king of Persia upon the death of Darius II, but Cyrus believed that he had a more rightful claim to the throne and gathered an army to contend his kingship. Cyrus gathered together Persian supporters and Greek mercenaries, including Xenophon himself. Cyrus at first deceived the Greeks about the purpose of his mission and led them some considerable way, to the Euphrates River at Thapsacus, before telling them his true intentions.
Xenophon goes into some detail about the march and mentions Meno on a few occasions. Meno escorted, with some of his troops, the Cilician queen Epyaxa back to Cilicia. Meno lost some hundred troops on this mission, either because his troops were caught pillaging and killed by the Cilicians or because they got lost and wandered until they perished. Later, after Cyrus first told the Greeks that he was leading them into battle against Artaxerxes to seize the Persian throne, the Greeks were dismayed and demanded more money before they would continue. Meno won the admiration of Cyrus by persuading his troops to cross the Euphrates first (as a show of their willingness to follow Cyrus) before the other troops had decided. At another point, Meno's soldiers became enraged with Clearchus, the Spartan general, unsuccessfully trying to stone him to death, an act which nearly led to Meno's and Clearchus' men openly fighting between them. This story, along with his loss of 100 men in Cilicia, suggests that Meno maintained poor discipline among his troops. Xenophon claims that Meno maintained discipline by participating in his troops' wrongdoings.
Cyrus eventually engaged with Artaxerxes' troops headed by Tissaphernes at the Battle of Cunaxa. The Greek contingent won easily, but Cyrus and his troops were repulsed and Cyrus himself was killed in battle. The Greek troops, now led by Clearchus, viewing themselves as the victors, declared their support for Ariaeus, one of Cyrus' commanders and the most senior Persian on their side still living. Ariaeus, accompanied by Meno, his "guest-friend," met privately with Tissaphernes. Ctesias tells us that Tissaphernes here began to plot with Meno to betray the Greeks. Xenophon writes that Clearchus believed that Meno had been pouring false slander about the Greeks into Tissaphernes' ear and was aware that Meno was plotting to seize control of the army from Clearchus with Tissaphernes's favor. Sherylee Bassett suggests that Tissaphernes may have been here deceiving Meno into thinking he would support his leadership aspirations, playing the two main leaders, Clearchus and Meno, off against each other. Ariaeus declined the offer of kingship and Tissaphernes began apparently friendly negotiations with Clearchus for a truce, finally inviting him for a cordial meeting with the other Greek generals and officers. According to Ctesias, some of the Greek soldiers were hesitant to attend the meeting, but Meno persuaded the soldiers, who thereby persuaded the reluctant Clearchus, to comply. Clearchus, with four other generals (Agis of Arcadia, Socrates of Achaea, Proxenus of Boetia and Meno), twenty officers and some two hundred troops visited the tent of Tissaphernes but they were betrayed, Clearchus and the generals being captured and all of the officers and as many of the soldiers as could be caught being killed. The generals were taken to Artaxerxes and all were beheaded, except Meno.
Ctesias' account simply tells us, at this point, that Meno was spared. Diodorus says Meno was spared since he alone was thought willing to betray the Greeks. According to Xenophon, Meno was kept alive and tortured for a year before finally being killed. Ctesias is generally an overall unreliable historian, but since he was at the time a physician to Artaxerxes and was witness to some of the events (for example, attending to Clearchus before he was beheaded), he may be considered more reliable than Xenophon, who, as he himself admits, is merely repeating a report that he heard. On the other hand, the two reports need not necessarily differ, if Ctesias only knew of Meno being spared and was not aware that he was subsequently tortured and ultimately killed.
In Plato.
Meno appears his eponymous Platonic dialogue as a guest of Anytus accompanied by a considerable retinue of slaves. Meno's stay in Athens is short and Socrates mentions that Meno is not able to stay to attend the mysteries. The dialogue is probably not historical, but is meant to take place in 402 BC, shortly before Meno's Persian generalship or in 401 BC, while he is en route to Persia.
Socrates says that Meno is a former student of Gorgias and Meno notes that he has made many speeches on virtue before large audiences, suggesting an interest in sophistry. Socrates' comments also suggest that he is associated with the Greek eristic tradition of debate. Meno asks Socrates the question of whether virtue can be taught, leading to the epistemological quandary known as Meno's paradox which Socrates attempts to address through dialectic with one of Meno's slaves. Ultimately, Meno seems little interested in discovering the answer, but rather seeks a strong argument to use in debate and public speech. Xenophon had described Meno as being the complete opposite of virtuous and as believing that virtuous people were weak and ripe for being exploited. Socrates tries to lead Meno into the question of what virtue is, but Meno resists, asking Socrates to answer his initial question of whether virtue is teachable. The dialogue ends with the conclusion that virtue is not teachable, though without a conclusion on what virtue is.

Yahoo! Auctions is a service set up by the online search giant Yahoo! in 1998 to compete against eBay.
There are currently only three localizations of the service active in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan; Yahoo! has already discontinued the service in United States, Canada, Singapore, United Kingdom and Ireland. The US and Canada sections of the site were closed on June 16, 2007. The Singapore section of the site was closed on September 22, 2008. The UK and Ireland service was closed on June 28, 2002. During the shutdown of the UK and Ireland service, Yahoo! took the unusual step of endorsing its main auctions rival, eBay, as their 'preferred' service.
Yahoo! Auctions was preferred by some sellers for its no-fee policy — all revenue was from advertising. Singaporean users chose to shy away from eBay after the closure of Yahoo! Auctions in Singapore, citing high fees and a cluttered website.
SOLD.com.au.
In April 2001, Yahoo! acquired "SOLD.com.au", a major competitor to eBay in Australia. SOLD.com.au was previously owned by John Fairfax Holdings' online interactive arm, "F2". The site was given a new address within the yahoo.com domain. In August 2003, Yahoo! announced that the site would be shutting down and directed users to eBay.
Yahoo! Wallet.
Yahoo! Wallet is a lesser-known competitor to PayPal. Wallet was designed for use at Yahoo! websites such as Yahoo! Music and Yahoo! Auctions. Likewise, new Auctions sellers were required to confirm their identity by entering in their credit card number into Wallet. The service is still running.

St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College

St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College is an Eastern Orthodox Christian seminary located in Redfern, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is a full-member institution of the Sydney College of Divinity, a federation of theological schools each operated by different Christian denominations. It is the only accredited Orthodox tertiary institution of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. St Andrew's is an institution of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia. The current Dean is Archbishop Stylianos (Harkianakis) of Australia.
Archbishop Stylianos proposed the establishment of a theological college during the fourth clergy-laity congress in 1981. The delegates adopted his resolution for this urgent proposal and building, administrative and academic committees were formed.
There was need for a theological school that would be primarily dedicated to theological study in co-operation with other theological colleges. It was hoped that a centre of theological reflection and ecumenical dialogue would be created, offering the Orthodox world-view and perspective with great scriptural commentaries, the writings of the Greek Fathers, the Orthodox liturgy, iconography and spirituality.
The college opened in 1986 with Archbishop Stylianos, as the inaugural dean. He continues in that role at present, as well as being a lecturer in systematic theology.
Priestly vocations.
The four-year program of study (encompassing the three-year Bachelor of Theology degree as well as a fourth year of Honours or studies in Pastoral Theology and Practice) is the principal means of training bilingual clergy for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese. As such, admission is limited to those who aspire to the clergy or male students who are seeking to actively serve within the Archdiocese.
Degree programs.
St Andrew's currently offers the following accredited programs: Bachelor of Theology (with an honours program available), Master of Arts, Master of Theology, and a Basic Unit of Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) in Aged Care. Honours programs for the Master of Arts, Master of Theology, and doctoral programs can be undertaken through the Sydney College of Divinity.
Influence.
As the sole Orthodox theological college of its kind in the southern hemisphere, St. Andrew's has taught not only the clergy of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese, but also a notable number from other jurisdictions in Australia, particularly from the Serbian Orthodox Church in Australia and New Zealand.
"Phronema".
"Phronema" is the academic journal of the College. It has been published annually since the inception of the College. Phronema presents articles and book reviews from Orthodox and non-Orthodox academics on a wide variety of theologically-related topics.

Sky High (TV series)

The basic premise of the television series is somewhat similar in concept to the American series, Ghost Whisperer, in which the protagonist must use her powers to guide the dead on their journey to the afterlife by helping them determine the meaning or circumstance of their death. However, in Izuko's case, no matter how hard she tries, her guidance does not always result in a happy ending.
Plot.
Izuko (Yumiko Shaku) is a beautiful and mysterious gatekeeper to the afterlife. Known as the Guardian of the Gate, Izuko guides spirits of the recently departed on their journey...sometimes to Heaven, other times to Hell. The decision is theirs and it is not always an easy one. Often the spirit is the victim of a murder or other untimely death. In such case, a soul is offered three options: 1) accept their death as it is and proceed into Heaven to await reincarnation. 2) Wander the Earth as a ghost. 3) Take justice into their own hands and face the gates of Hell. Most episodes (see Episode List below) involve the guest starring character seeking to discover what happened to them and why—with Izuko attempting to guide them on the correct path. To her sadness and despite her compassion, Izuko does not always succeed and the moral dilemma is often very grey and unfair.
We discover in the big budget prequel (theatrical) film shot between Seasons 1 and 2, Sky High (2003 film) Izuko once faced this same decision herself. In life, her name was Mina…murdered by a supernatural serial killer. In the movie, Mina takes the place of the previous Guardian, killed by a demon. Mina is then unwittingly thrust into the role she plays in the TV series as Izuko, Guardian of the Gate—responsible for guiding the dead to sometimes happy and sometimes heart breaking ends.
Production.
"Sky High" premiered on the Japanese television network, TV-Asahi, on January 17, 2003. The series starred popular Japanese actress and supermodel Yumiko Shaku, also known internationally for her starring role as action heroine JXSDF Lt. Akane Yashiro in two subsequent Godzilla movies, Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla (2002) and (2003). "Sky High" Season 1 (Series 1) ran for ten episodes, ending with a three-part thriller featuring special guest star Yamada Maiko.
Season 2 (marketed as "Sky High 2") premiered on TV-Asahi on Friday, January 16, 2004, following the theatrical release of the big budget motion picture "Sky High"—a prequel to the TV series, and also starring Yumiko Shaku in a the big screen reprise of her TV series role. The second TV season of "Sky High" picks up on a number of elements from the big screen venture, including a darker, edgier look to Shaku's costuming in contrast to the softer, more colorful look of the first season. The ninth episode of Season 2, titled "Fate," served as the series finale.

List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics

The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, officially known as The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (Swedish: "Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne"), is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to researchers in the field of economics. The first award was given in 1969 to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1969, Frisch and Tinbergen were given a combined 375,000 SEK, which is equivalent to 2,871,041 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
As of late 2013, 45 Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic Sciences have been given to 74 individuals. Seven awards have been given for contributions to the field of macroeconomics, more than any other category. The institution with the most affiliated Nobel laureates in Economics is the University of Chicago, which has 28 affiliated laureates.

Mac Mini

The Mac Mini (marketed as Mac mini) is a small form factor desktop computer manufactured by Apple Inc. Like earlier mini-ITX PC designs, it is square and tall. It weighs . Before the mid-2011 revision, all models, except the late 2009 and 2010 server models, came with an internal optical disc drive. Models pre-2010 used an external power supply and were narrower but taller at . The Mac Mini is one of three desktop computers in the current Macintosh lineup, the other two being the iMac and Mac Pro, although it generally uses components usually featured in laptops, hence its small size.
The Mac Mini was the first consumer level Macintosh desktop to ship without a display, keyboard, or mouse since Apple's success following the release of the iMac, with Apple marketing it as "BYODKM" (Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard, and Mouse). The primary intended market for the Mac Mini was users switching from a traditional Windows PC to a Mac who might already own a compatible display, keyboard and mouse, though these could be easily purchased if needed. A special "Server" version of the computer is also intended for use as a server in a small network, and starting with the mid-2010 revision, all Server models include the Server edition of the OS X operating system.
The updated unibody Mac Mini is notable as Apple's first computer to include an HDMI video port to connect to a television or other display, more readily positioning the unit as a home theater device alternative to the Apple TV.
Overview.
A small form factor computer had been widely speculated and requested long before the release of the Mac Mini. Rumors predicted that the "headless iMac" would be extremely small, include no display, and would be positioned as Apple's entry-level desktop computer. On January 10, 2005, the Mac Mini was announced alongside the iPod shuffle at the Macworld Conference & Expo and was described by Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the time as "the cheapest, most affordable Mac ever".
The Mac Mini is an entry-level computer intended for budget-minded customers. Until the 2011 release, the Mac Mini had much less processing power than the other computers of the Macintosh lineup. Unlike regular desktop computers, which use standard-sized components such as 3.5-inch hard drives, Apple uses lower power laptop components in the Mac Mini to fit all the necessary components into the small case and to prevent overheating, common in such compact spaces. Previously, with the choice of components on the older models, the machine was considered somewhat slower than standard desktop computers. It also had less storage and memory than comparable desktops. However, the 2011 upgrade addressed many of these previous complaints.
In general, the Mac Mini has been praised as a relatively affordable computer with a solid range of features. However, the press also agrees that it is relatively high priced for a computer aimed at the lower segment of the market. It is possible to buy small form factor computers at the same price with faster processors, better graphics card, more memory, and/or more storage. The small form factor has made the Mac Mini particularly popular as a home theater solution. In addition, the small size and observed reliability has helped keep resale values high.
On October 22, 2009, Apple introduced a new server version of the Mac Mini along with revisions of the computer. This model lacks an optical drive, but contains a second hard drive in its place. This version is marketed as an affordable server for small businesses and schools.
A new model of the Mini was introduced on June 15, 2010. The new model was thinner, with a unibody aluminum case designed to be easily opened for RAM access, and incorporated upgraded hardware, such as an HDMI port and Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics. An update announced July 20, 2011 dropped the internal CD/DVD optical drive from all versions and introduced a Thunderbolt port, Intel Core i5 processor, and either Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics or AMD Radeon HD 6630M dedicated graphics. The server model was upgraded to a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. Quad-core i7 CPUs are also used in the late-2012 desktop Mac Mini computers.
Design.
The most notable feature of the Mac Mini is its size. The original design measured only . The exterior of the original Mac Mini was made of aluminum capped with polycarbonate plastic on the top and bottom. The original design had no visible screws and was not meant to be upgraded by the user. The back of the machine contains the I/O ports and vents for the cooling system. It had an external power supply.
The Mac Mini, updated on June 15, 2010, was fully redesigned, being slimmer than the prior models at only tall, but wider at a side. The weight rose from . The power supply is now internal as opposed to external. The chassis no longer has the polycarbonate plastic on the top or bottom. The newer model, introduced July 20, 2011 has the same physical dimensions but is slightly lighter, at , presumably because it lacks an internal CD/DVD drive.
The current Mac Mini is designed to be opened using a round cover on the bottom of the computer. Prior versions of the Mini were much more difficult to open. Some Mac Mini owners used a putty knife or a pizza cutter to pry open the cases of older Mini models to gain access to the interior for installation of cheaper third party memory upgrades. The official Apple Service Source manual for Mac Mini describes this procedure in detail, including an official Apple part number for a "modified putty knife". It's also possible to use wires to pull the white plastic bottom case out of the metal top case. While opening the case does not actually void the Mac Mini warranty, anything broken while the case is open is not covered. Other modifications include hard disk upgrades, overclocking the processor (G4 only), and upgrading the wireless networking (for older models) to 802.11n. The 2009 model can have its SuperDrive replaced with a second SATA hard drive. The removal of the optical drive in the 2011 models leaves internal space for a second internal hard drive or SSD, which can be ordered as a BTO option from Apple, or as an upgrade kit from 3rd party suppliers.
With the switch to the Intel Core Solo and Duo line, Apple initially used a socketed CPU in the Mac Mini that allowed the processor to be replaced. They switched to a non-socketed CPU with the 2009 model that did not allow an easy upgrade. With the June 2010 revision, the case can be readily opened to add RAM.
Home theater.
The Mac Mini can be used for home cinema (theater) applications. The small footprint, multi-format video output, digital audio output, remote control IR receiver and the relatively powerful Intel CPUs make it easy to use the Mac Mini as part of a home entertainment system.
It can be classified as a home theater PC (HTPC) with some limits. The Mac Mini does not include an integrated TV tuner card and cannot be upgraded to install one internally; accessing TV requires external devices like Elgato's EyeTV USB adapter or SiliconDust's HDHomeRun networked TV tuner which will encode and manage broadcast television from a cable or satellite receiver. The July 2011 model lacks a built-in CD/DVD player and OS X Lion no longer supports Front Row remote control software.
Pre-2009 Mac Mini models had a video connector which was compatible with DVI, HDMI (video only), SVGA, S-Video and composite video with the appropriate adapter. Sound is provided by a combination jack that uses both mini-RCA (analog) and optical fiber cables (digital). Unlike the Apple TV, the Mac Mini is backward compatible with televisions that have only composite or S-Video inputs. As of the July 2011 revision of the Mac Mini, the computer sports an Intel HD3000 graphics processor with an optional Radeon graphics processing unit available and Thunderbolt which makes decoding high-resolution video much quicker and efficient. The addition of an HDMI port simplifies connecting the Mini to high-definition televisions and home theater AV receivers.
Because of the similar small form factor, HDMI port, remote control IR receiver, and media browser interface, some users see the Mac Mini as an Apple TV alternative. It has both iTunes for media rental, purchase, and management, and a native user interface with Front Row, based on the user interface of the original Apple TV. The Apple TV is limited to video in the MP4 format, whereas Mac Mini users employing the appropriate QuickTime codecs can watch other video formats like Divx, Xvid, and the Matroska (Mkv) container, or almost all other formats using an open source player such as VLC, without resorting to hacks. The current Intel models of Mac Mini can display video via the HDMI port at a maximum resolution of 1080p and up to 2560x1600 via the mini display port with a compatible monitor.
The Mac Mini can also run third-party front-end media player applications for , such as Plex or XBMC, to be used as a home theater PC (HTPC).
Mac Mini G4.
Processors.
The Mac Mini G4 uses single-core 32-bit PowerPC processors that have 512 KB of on-chip L2 cache. The processor accesses memory through the front-side bus, which is clocked at 167 MHz. The chips in these models of Mac Mini run at 1.25, 1.33, 1.42, or 1.5 GHz. The computer supports an ATI Radeon 9200 graphics processor with 32 MB of DDR SDRAM standard. The high-end model of the last revision comes with 64 MB of video memory instead.
Memory.
The Mac Mini G4 uses 333 MHz DDR SDRAM, allows a maximum of 1 GB of memory, and has only one desktop DIMM slot for random-access memory. This restricts both the maximum amount of available memory, which can greatly reduce performance by forcing the system to page to the hard disk, and, since the system is unable to take advantage of dual channels, maximum bandwidth. This issue was addressed in the Intel models of Mac Mini by using two notebook DIMM slots.
Storage.
The Mac Mini G4 uses a single 2.5-inch Ultra ATA/100 hard drive, which offers a maximum transfer rate of 100 MB/s. Because of its sealed enclosure, it is not possible to upgrade the hard drive without opening the enclosure and possibly voiding the warranty of the system. The Mac Mini G4 also contains a second ATA cable that connects to the optical drive. A Combo drive was included as standard, while a SuperDrive able to write to DVDs was also an option.
External connectivity.
The original Mac Mini includes two USB 2.0 and one FireWire 400 port. Networking is supported with 10/100 Ethernet and V.92 modem ports, while 802.11b/g and Bluetooth were additional build-to-order options. The modem was later omitted from the Mac Mini, but an external modem remained an option. External displays are supported via a DVI port. Adaptors are also available for VGA, S-Video, and composite video. The system contains a built-in speaker and an analog 1/8-inch stereo Mini jack for sound out at the back of the case.
In the last revision of the Mac Mini G4, the internal mezzanine board was upgraded to accommodate the AirPort Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology onto one chip. In prior models, the Mac Mini included an AirPort Extreme card taped to the mezzanine board and a separate Bluetooth module. This new Wi-Fi card also no longer uses an MMCX-Female connector for the antenna (as the prior models did) but rather a proprietary Apple one.
Specifications.
"Notes:"
1 The serial number and specifications sticker on the underside of the latest revision do not carry the actual specs of the upgrade. For example, on a 1.5 GHz model, 1.42 GHz is listed. The product packaging also did not reflect the upgrade. Apple did not revise the official specifications on their web site.
Alternative operating systems.
The Mac Mini G4 can run different operating systems designed for the PowerPC architecture. For example, users can easily install the AmigaOS-compatible MorphOS, or Linux distributions such as Debian or Ubuntu.
Support for pre-OS X Mac applications.
Unlike the Intel models, a G4 Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.4 can run Mac OS 9 "Classic" applications, so long as a bootable copy of the OS 9 "System Folder" is installed from which to run the Classic environment. As of Mac OS X 10.5, the ability to run the Classic Environment was removed.
Intel-based Mac Mini.
Processors.
The current non-server Mac Mini is available in two versions, one with a mobile dual-core 64-bit Intel Core i5 processor that runs at 2.5 GHz and one with a choice of a mobile quad-core Intel Core i7 2.3 GHz or a quad-core Core i7 2.6 GHz; the server model has a choice of the same processors as the faster non-server model. The CPU in the slower non-server model has a 3 MB on-chip L3 cache, and the CPUs available for the faster non-server model and the server model have a 6 MB on-chip L3 cache; the cache is shared between the cores and GPU (if in use). Prior revisions used a "Penryn" Intel Core 2 Duo processor, "Merom"-based Core 2 Duo and "Yonah"-based Core Duo and Solo chips.
The 2006 and 2007 Mac Minis that come standard with a 32-bit Intel Core Duo processor can be changed to an Intel 64-bit Core 2 Duo processor through a simple upgrade. Since the 2006 and 2007 "Merom"-based Mac Minis came with socketed processors, the 32-bit processor can easily be removed, and replaced with a compatible 64-bit Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The following processors are compatible: 2.00 GHz Intel T7200 SL9SF, 2.16 GHz Intel T7400 SL9SE, 2.33 GHz Intel T7600 SL9SD. The more recent 2009 and later Mac Minis have the processors soldered onto the logic board and thus are not upgradable. Once the 2006 Mac Mini has been upgraded to a 64-bit Core 2 Duo processor, and RAM is upgraded to at least 2 GB, it can run OS X Lion through a minor modification by editing or deleting the platformsupport.plist file. A 2007 Mac Mini will run OS X Lion without any modification. Many users have found that such upgrades can make the 2006/2007 Mac Minis' performance even better than the 2009 Mac Mini models. Geekbench scores have shown that the 2.33 GHz Core 2 Duo fitted Mac Mini with 2 GB of RAM has a score of 3060 whereas a late 2009 Mac Mini with 2 GB of RAM has 3056 making the two machines fairly comparable.
While the Mac Mini G4 contained a separate graphics processor, all revisions of the Intel-based Mac Mini contain integrated GPUs, except in the 2011 version where the 2.5 GHz model contains a separate AMD Radeon GPU. In Apple's early marketing of the Mac Mini G4, it touted the superiority of the use of a discrete ATI Radeon 9200 32 MB graphics card over the integrated graphics included in many budget PCs. The Intel GMA that was built into the Mac Mini was criticized for producing stuttering video, despite supporting hardware accelerated H.264 video playback, and disappointing frame rates in graphics-intensive 3D games.
Memory.
Unlike the Mac Mini G4, the Intel-based Mac Mini uses a dual-channel architecture for memory. The original Intel-based Mac Mini uses 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM, while models starting with the early 2009 revision use 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM. From the 2011 revision the Mac Mini supports up to 16 GB of memory. The current model also features a removable bottom panel, so that the memory can be replaced by the user. Since the integrated graphics processor does not have its own dedicated memory, the system shares some of the main system memory with it.
Storage.
The Intel-based Mac Mini moves away from the formerly used Ultra ATA/100 to the newer Serial ATA interface, which offers a maximum 3 Gbit/s transfer rate, however all models of Intel Mac Mini have been limited to 1.5 Gbit/s even though the SATA standard supports a transfer of 3 Gbit/s. All models continue to use 2.5-inch hard drives as opposed to the 3.5-inch drives used in standard desktops. A server edition of the Mac Mini was introduced in October 2009, which omits the optical drive in favor of a second hard drive for a total of 1 TB of storage. A Combo drive was initially offered as standard, with the SuperDrive being an option, but through the 2010 models, all models that have an optical drive contain the SuperDrive as standard. The 2010 standard version of the Mac (without Server) comes with a 300 GB or on 2.66 GHz 500 GB of storage.
External connectivity.
The original Intel-based Mac Mini includes four USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port. Networking is supported with a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port and an integrated 802.11b/g AirPort card. Bluetooth was also made standard. External displays are supported through a DVI port. While the Mac Mini G4 supports only analog audio output, the Intel-based Mac Mini has separate mini-TOSLINK/3.5 mm mini-jacks that support both analog audio input and output as well optical digital S/PDIF input and output.
The I/O ports were changed with the early 2009 revision. A fifth USB 2.0 port was added and the FireWire 400 port was replaced with a FireWire 800 port. The AirPort card was upgraded to 802.11a/b/g/draft-n and later to 802.11a/b/g/n. Bluetooth was also upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1. Instead of a single full-size DVI port, a mini-DVI port was added along with a Mini DisplayPort connection, which allows dual display support. Unlike the DVI port, the Mini DisplayPort supports external displays with a resolution up to 2560 × 1600, which allows use of the 30-inch Cinema Display with the Mac Mini. As of this revision, the Apple Remote is no longer included with the Mac Mini.
The Mac Mini 2009 model gave access to 3 different USB busses on the back. Port 2 shares a USB bus with the IR connection. Ports 1+5 and 3+4 are each on their own USB bus. So it should be possible to get a throughput of 3x480=1440 Mbit/s.
Unibody Mac Mini.
Structure.
Starting from the mid-2010 revision, there is a removable panel on the bottom, enabling the user to upgrade the RAM. The new Mac Mini has an all-aluminium enclosure, called "unibody". The unibody manufacturing process was originally developed for the MacBook Air and later also used in the MacBook and MacBook Pro before being introduced into the Mac Mini range.
The built-in power supply negates the need for an external power supply "brick" used on prior models.
There have been other changes in the 2011 revision. They include the elimination of the Kensington Security Slot, as well as the optical drive. While the fifth USB 2.0 port was also removed, this has given space for an SD card slot to be included on the back of the machine.
Like the 2009 version, a Mini DisplayPort (which allows for a VGA connection, via a non-included cable) is included. An HDMI port, which Apple describes as being HDMI 1.4 compliant, replaces the mini-DVI port on the prior models as one of the main video connection methods. The HDMI port supports up to 1080p on HDMI connections and 8 channel 24-bit audio at 192 kHz, Dolby Surround 5.1 and stereo output. With the included HDMI to DVI adapter, for those currently using a DVI interface, the HDMI port will work with resolutions up to 1920 × 1200 pixels, while the Mini DisplayPort can concurrently support up to a resolution up to 2560 × 1600 pixels.
Mac Mini Server.
Apple offers a Server configuration of the Mac Mini. Originally this model came preloaded with only an OS X Server version of OS X, however later models instead came preloaded with the standard version of OS X, and a separate OS X Server package, which included separate component apps (including "Server App", "File Sharing", "Wiki Server", "Profile Manager", et al.). Later on, Apple released the OS X Server packaged app as a single purchase from the Mac App Store, containing all the separate components apps, so that any model of Mac computer could download and use them.
The mid-2010 Server model was initially the only Mac Mini to entirely remove the optical drive, replacing it with a second hard drive in its place, however from the mid-2011 models onwards, all models of Mac Mini had the optical drive removed.
From November 5, 2010 the Server model of Mac Mini (along with the Mac Pro Server, before all Mac Pros were removed from sale in certain territories) is the replacement for Apple's Xserve line, which was discontinued on January 31, 2011.

History of the Liberal Party of Canada

This article covers the history of the Liberal Party of Canada.
Party systems model.
According to recent scholarship there have been four party systems in Canada at the federal level since Confederation, each with its own distinctive pattern of social support, patronage relationships, leadership styles, and electoral strategies. Steve Patten identifies four party systems in Canada's political history
Clarkson (2005) shows how the Liberal Party has dominated all the party systems, using different approaches. It began with a "clientelistic approach" under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, which evolved into a "brokerage" system of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s under William Lyon Mackenzie King. The 1950s saw the emergence of a "pan-Canadian system", which lasted until the 1990s. The 1993 election — categorized by Clarkson as an electoral "earthquake" which "fragmented" the party system, saw the emergence of regional politics within a four party-system, whereby various groups championed regional issues and concerns. Clarkson concludes that the inherent bias built into the first-past-the-post system, has chiefly benefited the Liberals.
19th century.
Origins.
The Liberals are descended from the mid-19th century Reformers who agitated for responsible government throughout British North America. These included George Brown, Robert Baldwin, William Lyon Mackenzie and the Clear Grits in Upper Canada, Joseph Howe in Nova Scotia, and the Patriotes and Rouges in Lower Canada led by figures such as Louis-Joseph Papineau. The Clear Grits and "Parti rouge" sometimes functioned as a united bloc in the legislature of the Province of Canada beginning in 1854, and a united Liberal Party combining both English and French Canadian members was formed in 1861.
Confederation.
At the time of confederation of the former British colonies of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the radical Liberals were marginalized by the more pragmatic Conservative coalition assembled under Sir John A. Macdonald. In the 29 years after Canadian confederation, the Liberals were consigned to opposition, with the exception of one stint in government. Alexander Mackenzie was able to lead the party to power in 1873 after the Macdonald government lost a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons because of the Pacific Scandal. Mackenzie won the 1874 election, but lost the government to Macdonald in 1878. Liberals spent the next 18 years in opposition.
In dealing with labour unions, the laissez-faire Liberals under Mackenzie, George Brown and Edward Blake were antilabor, while Conservatives under Macdonald were prolabor in the process of making their National Policy work to raise wages (and profits) by imposing a tariff on imports. Macdonald was an important financial supporter of the labor newspaper and friend of trade-union leaders, who in turn aided his party during the election campaigns of the decade.
Provinces.
In Ontario, the Liberal Party under Oliver Mowat controlled the provincial government and advocated the rights of provinces. He was in close touch with Catholic officials, and received the Irish Catholic vote.
In Prince Edward Island during the 1860s the issue of confederation split the colony's Conservative Party leadership in 1864-65, but after that the central issues were sectarianism and absentee landownership. The defection of rural supporters from the Conservatives allowed the Liberals to win the 1867 provincial election. But the issue of denominational grants to schools cost the Liberals their Roman Catholic support in 1870, and resulted in a coalition government that ruled the island for 17 of the next 21 years.
The Nova Scotia Liberal Party fared poorly in national elections during the 1880s and early 1890s. The national party advocated policies that would discontinue the national coal subsidy and, for all practical purposes, eliminate Catholic schools in Manitoba, policies disliked by provincial coal miners and Catholics respectively. William Stevens Fielding influenced a more moderate coal policy and defused the school issue. Thus in 1896 the provincial Liberals improved their showing in the national election.
Laurier era.
In their early history, the Liberals were the party of continentalism (free trade with the United States), and opposition to imperialism. The Liberals also became identified with the aspirations of Quebecers as a result of the growing hostility of French-Canadians to the Conservatives. The Conservatives lost the support of Quebecers because of the perceived role of Conservative governments in the execution of Louis Riel, and their role in the Conscription crisis of 1917.
It was not until Wilfrid Laurier became leader that the Liberal Party emerged as a modern party. Laurier was able to capitalize on the Tories' apparent alienation of French Canada by offering the Liberals as a credible alternative. Laurier was able to overcome the party's reputation for anti-clericalism that offended the still-powerful Quebec Roman Catholic Church. In English-speaking Canada, the Liberal Party's support for free trade made it popular among farmers, and helped cement the party's hold in the growing prairie provinces.
Laurier led the Liberals to power in the 1896 election (in which he became the first Francophone Prime Minister), and oversaw a government that increased immigration in order to settle Western Canada. Laurier's government created the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta out of the North-West Territories, and promoted the development of Canadian industry.
20th century.
Loss of power.
The Liberals lost power in the 1911 election due to opposition to the party's policies on reciprocity (or free trade), and the creation of a Canadian navy.
The Conscription crisis divided the party as many Liberals in English Canada supported conscription. Many of them joined Sir Robert Borden's Conservatives to form a Unionist government. With numerous Liberal candidates running as Unionists or Liberal-Unionists with the support of provincial Liberal parties in a number of provinces, the Laurier Liberals were reduced to a largely Quebec-based rump. The long term impact of the Conscription crisis benefited the party as the issue only added to the animosity of French-Canadians towards the Conservatives, making that party unpopular in Quebec for decades.
Canadian sovereignty.
Under Laurier, and his successor William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Liberals promoted Canadian sovereignty and greater independence from the British Empire. In Imperial Conferences held throughout the 1920s, Canadian Liberal governments often took the lead in arguing that the United Kingdom and the dominions should have equal status, and against proposals for an "imperial parliament" that would have subsumed Canadian independence. After the King-Byng Affair of 1926, the Liberals argued that the Governor General of Canada should no longer be appointed on the recommendation of the British government. The decisions of the Imperial Conferences were formalized in the Statute of Westminster, which was actually passed in 1931, the year after the Liberals lost power.
The Liberals also promoted the idea of Canada being responsible for its own foreign and defence policy. Initially, it was Britain which determined external affairs for the dominion. In 1905, Laurier created the Department of External Affairs, and in 1909 he advised Governor General Earl Grey to appoint the first Secretary of State for External Affairs to Cabinet. It was also Laurier who first proposed the creation of a Canadian Navy in 1910. Mackenzie King recommended the appointment by Governor General Lord Byng of Vincent Massey as the first Canadian ambassador to Washington in 1926, marking the Liberal government's insistence on having direct relations with the United States, rather than having Britain act on Canada's behalf.
Liberals and the social safety net.
In the period just before and after the Second World War, the party became a champion of 'progressive social policy'.
As Prime Minister for most of the time between 1921 and 1948, King introduced several measures that led to the creation of Canada's social safety net. Bowing to popular pressure, he introduced the mother's allowance, a monthly payment to all mothers with young children. He also reluctantly introduced old age pensions when J. S. Woodsworth required it in exchange for his Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party's support of King's minority government. Later, Lester B. Pearson introduced universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, and the Canada Assistance Plan (which provided funding for provincial welfare programs).
Trudeau era.
Under Pierre Trudeau, the mission of a progressive social policy evolved into the goal of creating a "just society".
The Trudeau Liberals became the champions of official bilingualism, passing the "Official Languages Act", which gave the French and English languages equal status in Canada. Trudeau hoped that the promotion of bilingualism would cement Quebec's place in confederation, and counter growing calls for an independent Quebec. This policy aimed to transform Canada into a country where English and French-Canadians could live together in comfort, and could move to any part of the country without having to lose their language. While this has not occurred, official bilingualism has helped to halt the decline of the French language outside of Quebec, and has also ensured that all federal government services (as well as radio and television services provided by the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Radio-Canada) are available in both languages throughout the country.
The Trudeau Liberals are also credited with support for official multiculturalism as a means of integrating immigrants into Canadian society without forcing them to shed their culture. As a result of this and a more sympathetic attitude by Liberals towards immigration policy, the party has built a base of support among recent immigrants and their children.
The most lasting effect of the Trudeau years has been the patriation of the Canadian constitution and the creation of Canada's Charter of Rights. Trudeau Liberals support the concept of a strong, central government, and fought Quebec separatism, other forms of Quebec nationalism, and the granting of "distinct society" status to Quebec. Such actions, however, served as rallying cries for sovereigntists & alienated many francophone Quebecers
The other primary legacy of the Trudeau years has been financial. Net federal debt in fiscal 1968, just before Trudeau became Prime Minister, was about $18-billion, or 26 per cent of gross domestic product; by his final year in office, it had ballooned to $206-billion– at 46 per cent of GDP, nearly twice as large relative to the economy.
From fiscal 1976 to fiscal 1985: ten straight years in which the government ran not only an overall deficit, but an operating deficit. The overall deficit throughout this later phase never fell below 3 per cent of GDP; it averaged 5.6 per cent. In the final year of Liberal rule, 1984–85, total spending exceeded revenues by more than 50 per cent. The deficit that year, at $38.5-billion, was equal to nearly 9 per cent of GDP. Interest payments alone were now enough to consume nearly one-third of every revenue dollar. With interest costs compounding at a rate of 13 per cent per year, and the debt doubling every three or four years, that ratio could only grow.
The post-Trudeau party in opposition.
After Trudeau's retirement in 1984, many Liberals, such as Jean Chrétien and Clyde Wells, continued to adhere to Trudeau's concept of federalism. Others, such as John Turner, supported the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown Constitutional Accords, which would have recognized Quebec as a "distinct society" and would have increased the powers of the provinces to the detriment of the federal government.
Trudeau stepped down as Prime Minister and party leader in 1984, as the Liberals were slipping in polls. At that year's leadership convention, Turner defeated Chrétien on the second ballot to become Prime Minister. Immediately, upon taking office, Turner called a snap election, citing favourable internal polls. However, party was hurt by numerous patronage appointments, many of which Turner had made supposedly in return for Trudeau retiring early. Also, they were unpopular in their traditional stronghold of Quebec due to the constitution repatriation which excluded that province. The Liberals lost power in the 1984 election, and were reduced to only 40 seats in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority of the seats in every province, including Quebec. The 95-seat loss was the worst defeat in the party's history, and the worst defeat at the time for a governing party at the federal level. What was more, the New Democratic Party, successor to the CCF, won only ten less seats than the Liberals, and some thought that the NDP under Ed Broadbent would push the Liberals to third-party status.
The party began a long process of reconstruction. A small group of young Liberal MPs, known as the Rat Pack, gained fame by criticizing the Tory government of Brian Mulroney at every turn. Also, despite public and backroom attempts to remove Turner as leader, he managed to consolidate his leadership at the 1986 review.
The 1988 election was notable for Turner's strong opposition to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement negotiated by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Although most Canadians voted for parties opposed to free trade, the Tories were returned with a majority government, and implemented the deal. The Liberals recovered from their near-meltdown of 1984, however, winning 83 seats and ending much of the talk of being eclipsed by the NDP.
The party under Chrétien.
Turner resigned in 1990 due to growing discontent within the party with his leadership, and was replaced by bitter rival Jean Chrétien, who had served in every Liberal cabinet since 1965. Chrétien's Liberals campaigned in the 1993 election on the promise of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and eliminating the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Just after the writ was dropped for the election, they issued the Red Book, a detailed statement of exactly what the Liberals would do in office if they won power. This was unprecedented for a Canadian party. Taking full advantage of the inability of Mulroney's successor, Kim Campbell to overcome a large amount of antipathy toward Mulroney, they won a strong majority government with 177 seats—the third-best performance in party history, and their best since 1949. The Progressive Conservatives were cut down to only two seats, suffering a defeat even more severe than the one they had handed the Liberals nine years earlier. The Liberals were re-elected with a considerably reduced majority in 1997, but nearly tied their 1993 total in 2000. 
For the next decade, the Liberals dominated Canadian politics in a fashion not seen since the early years of Confederation. This was because of the destruction of the "grand coalition" of Western socially conservative populists, Quebec nationalists, and fiscal conservatives from Ontario that had supported the Progressive Conservatives in 1984 and 1988. The PCs' Western support, for all practical purposes, transferred en masse to the Western-based Reform Party, which replaced the PCs as the major right-wing party in Canada. However, the new party's agenda was seen as too conservative for most Canadians. It only won one seat east of Manitoba in an election (but gained another in a floor-crossing). Even when Reform restructured into the Canadian Alliance, the party was virtually nonexistent east of Manitoba, winning only 66 seats in 2000. Reform/Alliance was the official opposition from 1997 to 2003, but was never able to overcome wide perceptions that it was merely a Western protest party. The Quebec nationalists who had once supported the Tories largely switched their support to the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois, while the Tories' Ontario support largely moved to the Liberals. The PCs would never be a major force in Canadian politics again; while they rebounded to 20 seats in the next election, they won only two seats west of Quebec in the next decade.
Ontario and Quebec are guaranteed a majority of seats in the House of Commons under both Constitution Acts (59 percent of the seats ). As a result, it is very difficult to form even a minority government without substantial support in Ontario and/or Quebec. No party has ever formed a majority government without winning the most seats in either Ontario or Quebec. It is mathematically possible to form a minority government without a strong base in either province, but such an undertaking is politically difficult. The Liberals were the only party with a strong base in both provinces, thus making them the only party capable of forming a government.
There was some disappointment as Liberals were not able to recover their traditional dominant position in Quebec, despite being led by a Quebecer from a strongly nationalist region of Quebec. The Bloc capitalized on discontent with the failure of the 1990 Meech Lake Accord and Chrétien's uncompromising stance on federalism (see below) to win the most seats in Quebec in every election from 1993 onward, even serving as the official opposition from 1993 to 1997. Chrétien's reputation in his home province never recovered after the 1990 leadership convention when rival Paul Martin forced him to declare his opposition to the Meech Lake Accord. However, the Liberals did increase their support in the next two elections due to infighting within the Bloc. In the 1997 election, although the Liberals finished with a thin majority, it was their gains in Quebec which were credited with offsetting their losses in the Maritime provinces. In particular, the 2000 election was a breakthrough for the Liberals after the PQ government's unpopular initiatives regarding consolidation of several Quebec urban areas into "megacities." Many federal Liberals also took credit for Charest's provincial election victory over the PQ in spring 2003. A series of by-elections allowed the Liberals to gain a majority of Quebec ridings for the first time since 1984.
The Chrétien Liberals more than made up for their shortfall in Quebec by building a strong base in Ontario. They reaped a substantial windfall from the votes of fiscally conservative and socially liberal voters who had previously voted Tory, as well as rapid growth in the Greater Toronto Area. They were also able to take advantage of massive vote splitting between the Tories and Reform/Alliance in rural areas of the province that had traditionally formed the backbone of provincial Tory governments. Combined with their historic dominance of Metro Toronto and northern Ontario, the Liberals dominated the province's federal politics even as the Tories won landslide majorities at the provincial level. In 1993, for example, the Liberals won all but one seat in Ontario, and came within 123 votes in Simcoe Centre of pulling off the first clean sweep of Canada's most populated province. They were able to retain their position as the largest party in the House by winning all but two seats in Ontario in the 1997 election. The Liberals were assured of at least a minority government once the Ontario results came in, but it was not clear until later in the night that they would retain their majority. In 2000, the Liberals won all but three seats in Ontario.
While the Chrétien Liberals campaigned from the left, their time in power is most marked by the cuts made to many programs in order to balance the federal budget. Chrétien had supported the Charlottetown Accord while in opposition, but in power opposed major concessions to Quebec and other provincialist factions. In contrast to their promises during the 1993 campaign, they implemented only minor changes to NAFTA, embraced the free trade concept and– with the exception of the replacement of the GST with the Harmonized Sales Tax in some Atlantic provinces– broke their promise to replace the GST.
After a proposal for Quebec independence was narrowly defeated in the 1995 Quebec referendum, the Liberals passed the "Clarity Act" Clarity Act which outlines the federal government's preconditions for negotiating provincial independence. In Chrétien's final days, he supported same-sex marriage in Canada as well as decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of marijuana. Chrétien displeased the United States government when he pledged on March 17, 2003 that Canada would not support the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Polling released a month later showed the decision was largely popular, with 62% in favour of the Prime Minister's decision, and 35% opposed. Later polls would increase that margin of support.

Into the 21st century.
Martin succeeds Chrétien.
Paul Martin succeeded Chrétien as party leader and prime minister in 2003. Despite the personal rivalry between the two, Martin was the architect of the Liberals' economic policies as Minister of Finance during the 1990s. Chrétien left office with a high approval rating and Martin was expected to take the Liberals to greater heights. While his cabinet choices provoked some controversy over excluding many Chrétien supporters, it at first did little to hurt his popularity. However, the political situation changed with the revelation of the sponsorship scandal, in which advertising agencies supporting the Liberal Party received grossly inflated commissions for their services.
Having faced a divided conservative opposition for the past three elections, Liberals were seriously challenged by competition from the newly united Conservative Party led by Stephen Harper. The infighting between Martin and Chrétien's supporters also dogged the party. Nonetheless, by criticizing the Conservatives' social policies, the Liberals were able to draw progressive votes from the NDP which made the difference in several close races. On June 28, 2004 federal election, the Martin Liberals retained enough support to continue as the government, though they were reduced to a minority.
In the ensuing months, testimony from the Gomery Commission caused public opinion to turn sharply against the Liberals for the first time in over a decade. Despite the devastating revelations, only two Liberal MPs--David Kilgour (who had, ironically, crossed the floor from the PC Party in 1990) and Pat O'Brien—left the party for reasons other than the scandal. Belinda Stronach, who crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberals, gave Martin the number of votes needed, although barely, to hold onto power when an NDP-sponsored amendment to his budget was passed only by the Speaker's tiebreaking vote on May 19, 2005.
In November, the Liberals dropped in polls following the release of the first Gomery Report. Nonetheless, Martin turned down the NDP's conditions for continued support, as well as rejected an opposition proposal which would schedule a February 2006 election in return for passing several pieces of legislation. The Liberals thus lost the no-confidence vote on November 28; Martin thus became only the fifth prime minister to lose the confidence of the House, but the first to lose on a straight no-confidence motion. Due to the Christmas holiday, Martin advised Governor General Michaëlle Jean to dissolve Parliament and call an election for January 2006.
The Liberal campaign was dogged from start to finish by the sponsorship scandal, which was brought up by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) criminal investigation into the leak of the income trust announcement. Numerous gaffes, contrasting with a smoothly run Conservative campaign, put Liberals as many as ten points behind the Conservatives in opinion polling. They managed to recover some of their momentum by election night, but not enough to retain power. They won 103 seats, a net loss of 30 from when the writs were dropped, losing a similar number of seats in Ontario and Quebec to the Tories. However, the Liberals managed to capture the most seats in Ontario for the fifth straight election (54 to the Tories' 40), holding the Conservatives to a minority government. While the Conservatives captured many of Ontario's rural ridings, the Liberals retained most of the population-rich Greater Toronto Area. Many of these ridings, particularly the 905 region, had historically been bellwethers (the Liberals were nearly shut out of this region in 1979 and 1984), but demographic changes have resulted in high Liberal returns in recent years.
Martin resigned as parliamentary leader after the election and stepped down as Liberal leader on March 18, having previously promised to step down if he didn't win a plurality.
In Opposition and 2006 convention.
Bill Graham was appointed interim party and parliamentary leader and the process to select a new party leader began. An unusually large number of prominent members such as Frank McKenna, Brian Tobin,
Allan Rock and Belinda Stronach declined to run, yet at the same time many new faces stepped forward. There were eight people running for the leadership of the Liberal Party at the time of the convention:
The Liberal Party reportedly felt they could quickly regain power, so they accelerated the leadership selection process. While there were some predictions the party's National Executive would call the convention for as late as March 2007, it instead decided to announce the convention for the first weekend of December 2006.
On December 2 in Montreal, the Liberals voted for their new party leader. The first ballot results had Michael Ignatieff leading the pack with 30% of the delegates, Bob Rae second with 20%, and Stéphane Dion and Gerard Kennedy in third and fourth respectively with 16% of the votes each. The remaining contenders gathered less than 5% of the first ballot vote and Martha Hall Findlay was eliminated as she came in last on the first ballot, she endorsed Stéphane Dion for leader before voting began for the second ballot the next morning. Before voting began for the second ballot, Scott Brison and Joe Volpe voluntarily dropped out of the race, and both endorsed Bob Rae. The second ballot results showed Ignatieff again leading the way, with Rae in second, Dion in third, Kennedy in fourth, and Dryden in fifth. Dryden was thus eliminated, and he endorsed Bob Rae as well. Kennedy dropped out of the race and endorsed Stéphane Dion. Thus the third ballot came down to only Ignatieff, Rae and Dion. Dion jumped to first on the third ballot with Ignatieff and Rae falling to second and third respectively. Rae was eliminated, and Dion was elected leader over Ignatieff on the fourth ballot.
On May 11, 2006, Montreal's "La Presse" reported that the Government of Canada will file a lawsuit against the Liberal Party to recover all the money missing in the sponsorship program. Scott Brison told reporters that same day that the Liberals has already paid back the $1.14 million into the public purse, however the Conservatives believe that there is as much as $40 million unaccounted for in the sponsorship program.
On September 28, 2007, party national director Jamie Carroll, was criticized for comments he allegedly made in response to a suggestion that the Liberals should hire more francophone Quebecers to appeal to francophone voters. According to some persons present at a private meeting, Carroll said "Do we also have to hire people from the Chinese community to represent the Chinese community?". He later indicated that a statement he made was taken out of context. Several Quebec MPs and the president of the party's Quebec wing said that Carroll was quoted correctly, with Pablo Rodriguez and Liza Frulla demanding that he be fired. Dion affirmed Carroll's version of events, and rejected calls for his dismissal. Carroll initially threatened to sue for defamation and demand 12 to 18 months of severance, though Dion later had him quietly reassigned to another position.
British Columbia MP Blair Wilson was resigned from caucus and the shadow cabinet, after the "Vancouver Province" charged that he was involved in unlawful off-the-books cash spending, and that his private businesses had numerous discrepancies and unpaid debts. Wilson, who is being investigated, has denied the allegations.
For much of its history, the Liberal Party has been referred to as "Canada's Natural Governing Party", due to the party's election success and a weak Conservative Opposition. However, in the aftermath of the Liberal Party's poor performance in the 2011 federal election, there is speculation that the Conservative Party is now in a position to replace the Liberals in that unofficial status.
Leaders of the Liberal Party since 1867.
Notes:
1 Brown was regarded by most Liberal candidates as their leader in the 1867 election but did not officially hold the title. Had he won a seat he would have almost certainly become Leader of the Opposition and had the Liberals won enough seats to form a government Brown would almost certainly have become Prime Minister. However, he failed in his bid for a seat in the House of Commons and the Liberals had no official leader until 1873.
2 Herb Gray served as Leader of the Opposition from February 6 until Chrétien was re-elected to Parliament, and took his seat on December 21, 1990. He led the Liberal Party in parliament, though he was never the leader or interim leader of the Liberal Party as a whole.
3 After the defeat of the Liberals by the Conservatives of Stephen Harper in the 2006 Canadian federal election, held on January 26, Paul Martin announced in the early hours of January 27, 2006 his intention to resign the leadership of the Liberal Party. Bill Graham was later selected as parliamentary leader by caucus, while Martin indicated he would remain nominal party leader. On March 18, 2006, Graham was appointed interim leader after Martin officially stepped down from the post.
The Liberal Party held its first leadership convention in 1919, electing William Lyon Mackenzie King as leader. Prior to that party leaders were chosen by caucus.

Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars stating "Pianist Muhal Richard Abrams leads an 18-piece orchestra on his seven originals that make up the "Hearinga Suite". Much of the music is quite adventurous, although "Oldfotalk" is fairly conventional. Although the personnel includes such fine players as trumpeters Jack Walrath and Cecil Bridgewater and saxophonists John Purcell and Marty Ehrlich, the emphasis is on group interplay and the colorful arrangements. Throughout this very interesting set, Abrams shows how a big band can logically be utilized in freer forms of jazz. ". The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3½ stars stating "This marks something of a quantum shift, a move towards something larger and more cohesive. The spirit of Ellington is not far away here".

History.
The pub was built in 1860 on the corner of Darling and Ann Streets to cater for workers from nearby Mort Bay. In 1876 the building became a grocery, perhaps due to the competition of the nearby and larger Pacific Hotel and London Hotel. Its licence was transferred to the Unity Hall Hotel, then on the corner of Nicholson and Darling Streets East Balmain, now Oddfellows Hall, until 1910, when it lapsed.

Akio Mori

Mori was originally known for his physiology researches, but began to write books about human neuroscience, coining the term "game brain" on his 2002 book . He claimed that the brains of people who played video games were physically damaged. "Game Nō no Kyōfu" got much attention from multiple critics, such as Tamaki Saitō.
Mori's activities expanded into other genres such as journalism and politics due to the popularity of his books, though his theory about human brains was pointed out to be pseudoscientific. Japanese critic Hiroo Yamagata compared the book "Game Nō no Kyōfu" with the following movement of "Messages from Water" because those theories became popular via Japanese mass media without scientific backgrounds.
Life and career.
1969–2002: Early career and research.
Born in Hokkaidō, Mori graduated from the College of Humanities and Sciences of the Nihon University in 1969 and graduated from the Graduate School of Literatures of the Nihon University in 1971. Getting the academic degree Doctor of Medicine, he became a professor of the Nihon University, though he toured the Rockefeller University as a researcher and the Queen's University as a visiting scholar before that.
Originally, Mori was known for his many scientific researches about cats' physiology such as the collaborative work "Input-output relationships in cat's motor cortex after pyramidal section" released in 1981, the collaborative work "Low threshold motor effects produced by stimulation of area preinsularis (2pr.i) of the secondary sensory cortex in the cat; Input-output relationships" released in 1983, the collaborative work "Physiological properties and patterns of projection in the cortico-cortical connections from the second somatosensory cortex to the motor cortex, area 4 gamma, in the cat" released in 1989, the collaborative work "Fifth somatosensory cortex (SV) representation of the whole body surface in the medial bank of the anterior suprasylvian sulcus of the cat" released in 1991, the collaborative work "Low-threshold motor effects produced by stimulation of the facial area of the fifth somatosensory cortex in the cat" released in 1993, the collaborative work "The ipsilateral and contralateral connections of the fifth somatosensory area (SV) in the cat cerebral cortex" released in 1996, and his solo work "Cortico-cortical connections from somatosensory areas to the motor area of the cortex following peripheral nerve lesion in the cat" released in 1997.
On March 26, 2000, Mori was awarded the commendation certificate by the Nihon University for working with the University for 30 years. He also researched the human actions of sports such as kendo along with two other researchers, announcing the collaborative work "Two types of movement-related cortical potentials preceding wrist extension in humans" via the journal "NeuroReport" in July 2001. He established the Japanese Society of Health and Behavior Sciences in 2002, becoming the board chairperson of the society. It was later admitted as an associated party by the Japanese scientific organization, Science Council of Japan, on April 13, 2006.
Mori got the degree Doctor of Medicine, but had not interested in the researches about relationships between video games and human neuroscience until he met a programmer of computer softwares around 2000 when he made a new electroencephalograph.
2002–present: Literary career and political activities.
On July 10, 2002, the Japan Broadcast Publishing (or NHK Shuppan) published the independent book "Game Nō no Kyōfu", written by Mori, as a part of the series. According to the 2006 interview to , the chief editor of "Seikatsujin Shinsho", "Game Nō no Kyōfu" sold over 100,000 copies, becoming the best-selling book of the series. Additionally, the book was translated into traditional Chinese characters under the title "Xiao Xin Dian Wan Nao!" in 2005. Mori commenced research into the effects of video games on a child's mind. He has cited various violent crime committed by juveniles who played video games to support his position. His position is that playing video games can cause damage to a child's brain, but the theory was heavily criticized.
In 2004, Mori also claimed that the brains of people who used mobile e-mails were also damaged, calling those .
On October 19, 2004, the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association announced that the neuroscientific works of Mori and Ryuta Kawashima about video games had insufficient evidence to claim something. In 2005, however, Mori and Kawashima took part in a series of convocations, held by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan as a part of its activities for creating its guidelines of Japanese schools' operation.
In addition, Mori's book , published on August 1, 2006, was selected as the Japan National Council of Parent-Teacher Association's "recommended book" at that time.

Bangladesh University of Professionals

Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP) (Bengali: BUP বাংলাদেশ ইউনিভার্সিটি অব প্রফেশনালস) is the 30th public university of Bangladesh established in Mirpur, Dhaka in 2008, to run all educational institutions of the army, navy and air force and facilitate professional degrees for armed forces personnel and civilians through its affiliated institutions.
History.
The establishment of a university for the armed forces educational and training institutes was a long felt need.

To keep pace and to be at par with the fast developing world, national higher studies, research enabling modern knowledge and creating scope for education and studies are the obligations to be fulfilled. In order to expand and integrate the existing educational and training institutes of the armed forces, they were needed to be brought under a single umbrella or authority. Thereby, the establishment of the Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP) took place in that process. BUP came into being as the 30th public university of Bangladesh on 5 June 2008. It is a unique public university run by the armed forces, and also the youngest university.

Legatum Prosperity Index

The Legatum Prosperity Index is an annual ranking, developed by the Legatum Institute, of 142 countries. The ranking is based on a variety of factors including wealth, economic growth, education, health, personal well-being, and quality of life. In the 2013 rankings, Norway tops the list followed by Switzerland and Canada. The USA ranks 11th and the UK ranks 16th. Twenty-seven of the top 30 countries are democracies. 
Methodology.
The 2013 Legatum Prosperity Index is based on 89 different variables analysed across 142 nations around the world. Source data includes Gallup World Poll, World Development Indicators, International Telecommunication Union, Failed States Index, Worldwide Governance Indicators, Freedom House, World Health Organisation, World Values Survey, Amnesty International, Centre for Systemic Peace. The 89 variables are grouped into 8 sub-indexes, which are averaged using equal weights. The 8 sub-indexes are:
For example, Personal Freedom includes freedom of speech and religion, national tolerance for immigrants and ethnic and racial minorities. The Social Capital sub-index includes the percentage of citizens who volunteer, give to charity, help strangers, and who feel they can rely on family and friends.
Oxford Analytica assisted in the early development of the Prosperity Index and has contributed to shaping the methodology. Today, the annual Index is produced and published by the Legatum Institute.

White Bay Hotel

The White Bay Hotel was built in 1860 on the corner of the then Crescent and Weston Streets in Rozelle, an inner-west suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Serving the workers of the Glebe Island abattoirs and soap factories, it was relocated in 1915 to make way for the White Bay goods railway.
Rebuilt in brick on what is now Victoria Road and popular with the wharfies (longshoremen) of the White Bay Container Terminal until the transferral of its facilities to Port Botany, the hotel, which became increasingly squeezed by the widening of Victoria Road after the construction of the Anzac Bridge, ceased trading in 1992.
Between this time and 2008, squatters had moved in and were particularly prominent during the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
In June 2008, the owner of the hotel had lodged an application to redevelop the building. 
On 5 September 2008, the hotel was destroyed by a deliberately lit fire and was demolished.
The New South Wales Government purchased the site in June 2010 for A$2.5 million.
Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority recently cleared the White Bay Hotel site of building rubble.

Orlando Phillips

Orlando Darryl Phillips (born June 30, 1960 in San Francisco, California) is a retired American basketball player. He was a strong rebounding Center or Power Forward who also played in Australia and Europe during his career.
College career.
The 6'10" (209 cm) tall Orlando Philips was a standout center for the Pepperdine University Waves, co-winning the 1983 West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year award with Waves team mate Dane Suttle.
Professional career.
Unfortunately little is known about the professional basketball career of Orlando Phillips. He was selected as the 69th pick in Round 3 of the 1983 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, but he never made their roster.
In 1989 he played for the Adelaide 36ers in Australia's National Basketball League. Phillips played 25 games for the 36ers where he averaged 20.4 points, 10.9 rebounds, 1.0 blocked shot and he shot the ball at 62.5% per game. Phillips had a slow start to the 1989 NBL season while still recovering from a broken foot, but his numbers increased through the season. He wore the number "00" for the 36ers and early in the NBL season before his form changed, the joke in Adelaide was that 00 stood for "Oh Oh". 36ers players were told by their then coach Gary Fox that Phillips was a non-smoker, a non-drinker, and that he wasn't a "womaniser". According to Scott Ninnis, this proved to be false after Phillips had reportedly been seen drunk at a bar with a woman under each arm while smoking a cigarette, all within a week of his arrival. Al Green recalled during the 36ers "The Golden Era" DVD that this helped Phillips fit in very well with the team off the court.
Orlando Phillips played 25 NBL games for the 36ers in 1989, averaging 20.5 points @ 62.6%, 11 rebounds, 1 assist, 1 block and 1.2 steals in 31 minutes per game.
Phillips also had a stint in the Euroleague with Pau Orthez in the 1992-93 season. He played 14 games for Orthez and averaged 12 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game.

Saint Michael Academy (Catarman)

St. Michael Academy, a private, sectarian, non-stock secondary school, is the first and the only Catholic learning institution estabilshed in the heart of Catarman, capital town of historical Northern Samar, owned and operated by the Congregation of the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena - The Philippines; thus, the only Dominican educational institution found in the Samar - Leyte region operating since 1946.
History.
It was in June 1946, when the Prioress General of the Congregation of Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena, Rev. Mo. Natividad Pilapil, OP, received another invitation from the Bishop of the Diocese of Calbayog, Most Rev. Miguel Acebedo, DD. The request was to open a school in Catarman that would be of great help to the Church’s mission of teaching its doctrines and practicing its morals. In answer to the request of the good Bishop, the prioress general instructed three Sisters assigned in La Milagrosa Academy in Calbayog City, Samar to proceed to Catarman and administer the opening of a new school. Immediately after receiving the orders, Mo. Teresita Hacbang, OP, Sr. Ma Rosa Santiago, OP, Sr. Magdalena Quisay, OP and two working students left for Catarman via Carangian San Jose, Northern Samar.
July 1946, a new and promising school was founded. And in grateful appreciation for Bishop Miguel Acebedo, the newly established school was named Saint Michael Academy. To help the Sisters in the opening of the classes, a Board of Directors was created with Atty. Mariano Singzon as president, and benign members Rev. Fr. Potenciano Ortega, the parish priest of Catarman, Don Ignacio Lahorra, Señor Bernabe Figueroa, Señor Francisco Arraiza and Judge Alberto Lim. Some kindhearted families also lent some tables and chairs to the Sisters. Since there was no existing building yet for the students and for the Sisters, Mrs. Vicenta Balite and Señor Joaquin Cardenas offered part of their houses to be used as classrooms for the incoming students and for the Sisters’ temporary convent for almost two years.
Saint Michael Academy, the pioneer in tertiary and basic education in Catarman, opened its door on July 7, 1946. The first teaching staff was composed of Mo. Teresita, OP as head of the school, Sr. Ma Rosa, OP, Sr. Magdalena, OP and four lay BSE instructors. During the summer of 1948, SMA successfully produced 17 pioneer graduates in high school.
Also in the year 1948, a parcel of land near the church was leased by the good Bishop to the Congregation where the existing location of the school is situated up to this day. And the school decided to open college with courses: Associate in Arts and Elementary Teacher’s Certificate and elementary level; thus, changing the institution’s name to St. Michael Junior College.
Only after a year, on April 28, 1949, SMJC conferred, for the first time in the history of northern-part of Samar Island, the degree of Associate in Arts to Jose “Peping” Figueroa, Lucia Reyes-Olmedo and nine others.
 During the 1950’s, more and more innovations and remarkable accomplishments were completed and realized. It was on April 1952 that SMJC produced its 21 pioneer graduates in elementary together with the 26 graduates in college, awarded with the degree in Elementary Teacher’s Certificate. Unfortunately, it was also in this era that the school decided to phase out the college department due to dearth of resources and manpower. In 1957, 2 wooden structures were constructed: the Sisters’ Convent and a 2 floor school building adjacent to the church.
 In the 1960’s, the original name of the school was again used, Saint Michael Academy. The 60’s was the celebrated days of SMA. It officially earned its name as one of the most prestigious Catholic institutions in Samar Island. At this time, SMA started to win awards and receive recognitions.
 SMA indeed became one of the jewels of the congregation, the diocese, and the municipality.
 The 1970’s was a time filled with uncertainties and fear. Martial law was declared but it did not deter SMA’s pursuit of passing on the excitement of learning, based on Christian principles. SMA did its share of instilling to the minds of our people, the value of freedom, good governance and the influence of unity to the country. Sad to say, during this period the elementary level was decided to be discontinued due to small number of enrollees. In total, the SMA elementary department produced 314 graduates since its opening in the school year 1951-1952. By this time SMA became an exclusive high school which has an increasing enrollment. Also, SMA became popular for sports particularly in basketball in this period.
 During the 1980’s rock, punk and rap music coupled with extraordinary fashion sense flourished. At this time, SMA was struggling to reinvent itself to suit to the ever changing and challenging phase of education and the new generation of learners the school has.
After the revolution, SMA became one of the centers of excellence in Samar both in academics, culture, sports and the arts, showcasing its diverse talents and academic potentials not only in the provincial level but competing also in the region.
SMA also became part of the Diocese of Catarman’s history when it celebrated its 10th year anniversary as a Diocese by staging a show in 1985.
As the new government was installed, a new 2 floor building was proposed by Sr. Patricia Aguilar, OP, and during the late 80’s the new building was inaugurated, now the St. Dominic Building.
 1990’s was a decade full of pleasant surprises and jubilation and firsts. The enrollment rose dramatically. The school’s population even reached a thousand which resulted to insufficient classrooms and other school facilities. As a result, another 2-storey building was constructed, now the St. Catherine Building, through the effort of Sr. Florencia Cabañog, OP. It houses some of the Administrative Offices, the Faculty Room, the Science Laboratory, the Learning Resource Center, the Computer Laboratory, the School Clinic and the Guidance Office. There were many scholarships offered then, from the government, alumni, private persons and agencies. But in late 90’s, the enrollment gradually decreased again because of the free education in the public school.
 It was in February 27, 1994 when SMA Alumni Foundation, Inc was officially founded that grants scholarship for the children of the needy alumni among others and spearheaded the very first Grand Alumni Homecoming which was held on October 1, 1994 to pool together its graduates after 48 glorious years.
April 1994 was the beginning of the Summer Operation Head-start that orients new students with certain subject areas in preparation for the incoming school year.
SMA brought home the bacon from different competitions such as brain and beauty contests, science-math camps, quiz bees, cultural dance contests and the unbeatable SMA drum and lyre corps. Students passing the NCEE 100% passing for 5 consecutive years is an honor of the school, and school year 1994-1995 is the 6th year of passing the standardized test conducted by the Department of Education (former DECS); thus, it made SMA to rank 1st in the NSAT among secondary schools in the Division of Northern Samar and was listed as among the 250 top performing secondary school nationwide for NSAT.
 Due to the implementation of K+12 policy of the Department of Education as a reform in our national educational system starting school year 2012-2013, the need for the construction of another building, now the Mother Francisca Building, to house additional classrooms, the bookstore and supplies store and the transfer of the canteen has been initiated through the untiring leadership of Sr. Meriza Ocampo, OP.
 Today, Saint Michael Academy of Catarman, Northern Samar, through the untiring efforts of the Dominican Sisters and its dedicated Mentors, continually reaps the fruits of its hard and unfaltering labor for the past 70 years of its existence and has been an institution constantly facing the challenging task of education, with ever creativity and generous commitment for the greater glory of God. Presently, the school has a total enrolment of more than 750 students, under the watchful concern of 4 Dominican Sisters with satisfactory number of personnel. It boasts 2 two-floor buildings, a new three-floor building, a bigger multi-purpose hall, a student lounge, a Computer Laboratory with 50 units of computer, all with Internet access, an enhanced library and a Chapel among others.
Many innovations in the School’s curriculum were also implemented since its foundation: this is to address the students varying needs as well as to keep up with the technological advancement of the world. The latest innovations of the school are the integration of Computer-aided Instruction with Internet access in all subject areas from first year to fourth year and the adoption of the revised Basic Education Curriculum with Religion as the core subject being a Catholic and a Dominican – Siena School.
The school had also undergone Congregational Evaluation Visit 1 in February 1995 and Congregational Evaluation Visit 2 in February 2000. These series of evaluation visits are in preparation for the school to be a PAASCU Accredited School in the near future. During the school year 2003-2004 under Sr. Trinidad Garcia, OP, the SMA was rated ABOVE STANDARD and was recognized as ONE of the EXCELLENT SCHOOLS in Region VIII by the ESC Certifying Team sent by the DepEd and FAPE Regional Offices. Last November 2008, a re-assessment was concluded by the same offices and once again, the school was rated as an ABOVE STANDARD school.
Saint Michael Academy – Catarman will continue to hone and develop young people, remembering its rich and glorious history, witnessing God’s message by transforming lives into mature, educated Christians with greater devotion to Mary, ready to serve God, neighbor and country and celebrating God’s blessing by continuing its mission of proclaiming Christ through a quality-Catholic education inspired by the Dominican Ideals of Passion for Truth and Compassion for Humanity.

<doc id="19769933" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19769933" title="Disputed status of Olivenza">
Disputed status of Olivenza

The Disputed status of Olivenza refers to a dispute between Portugal and Spain over the territory on the border of those two states known as Olivenza ("Olivença" in Portuguese). 
The area has been under Spanish control since the War of Oranges in 1801, but it is not recognized by Portugal. The dispute for Olivenza was old. It is located on the frontier between the two Iberian countries in Upper Alentejo ("Alto Alentejo"), on the left bank of the Rio Guadiana, neighbor to Elvas and 24 km to the south of Badajoz. An area of much litigation and conflict since the thirteenth century, the bridge that linked the two sides of the frontier was destroyed during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1709. The declaration of war between the two countries in 1801 led to the Spanish occupation of Olivenza, confirmed by the Treaty of Badajoz in the same year. The Franco-Spanish project of occupying and dividing Portugal resulted in the Portuguese royal family going to the Portuguese territory of Brazil, while the agreements made with the English resulted in Spanish control being maintained. Despite the recognition in the Treaty of Vienna of Portuguese rights to the territory of Olivenza (in article 105), it remained as part of Spain after the Bourbon restoration.
In Portuguese official maps the border is unmarked in that region (left bank of Guadiana river south of Badajoz), and until the 20th-century Portuguese was the local language. Although the annexation is still unrecognized (a matter brought every now and then in diplomatic circles) the question is far from being a major problem between both countries.
Claims.
Olivenza had been under continuous Portuguese sovereignty since 1297 when it was occupied by the Spanish in 1801 and formally ceded by Portugal later that year by the Treaty of Badajoz. Spain claims the "de jure" sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked. Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be as demarcated by that treaty. Portugal claims the "de jure" sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz was revoked by its own terms (the breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation) when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807.
Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1815, which Spain signed in 1817, that states that the winning countries are to ""endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority"". Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be as demarcated by the Treaty of Alcañices of 1297. Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna, but has equally never directly acknowledged the Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza.
Notability.
Spanish public opinion is not generally aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza (in contrast to the Spanish claim on Gibraltar or the Moroccan claims on Ceuta, Melilla and the "Plazas de soberanía"). On the other hand, awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public.

Trouble Waiting to Happen

"Trouble Waiting to Happen" is a humorous song from the Warren Zevon album "Sentimental Hygiene". As the title would suggest, the song's theme is about the narrator describing various troubles that are facing him. These include the third and fourth world wars and being slandered in the Rolling Stone (With Zevon commenting on what he had supposedly done as sounding "like a lot of fun"). The line may be a reference to the fact that after disappointing sales of his "The Envoy" album, Asylum Records dropped Zevon, but never told him about what they had done. He found out in the end by reading the gossip column of the Rolling Stone. The song ends with a warning that trouble is waiting to happen to us all, and a repeated chorus of the songs title.

History of the New Democratic Party

This article covers the history of the New Democratic Party of Canada.
20th century.
Origins and early history.
In 1956, after the birth of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) by a merger of two previous labour congresses, negotiations began between the CLC and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) to bring about an alliance between organized labour and the political left in Canada. In 1958 a joint CCF-CLC committee, the National Committee for the New Party (NCNP), was formed to create a "new" social democratic political party, with ten members from each group. The NCNP spent the next three years laying down the foundations of the New Party. During this process, a large number of New Party Clubs were established to allow like-minded Canadians to join in its founding, and six representatives from New Party Clubs were added to the National Committee. In 1961, at the end of a five-day long Founding Convention which established its principles, policies and structures, the New Democratic Party was born and Tommy Douglas, the long-time CCF Premier of Saskatchewan, was elected its first leader. In 1960, before the NDP was founded, one candidate, Walter Pitman, won a by-election under the New Party banner. 
The influence of organized labour on the party is still reflected in the party's conventions as affiliated unions send delegates on a formula based on their number of members. Since approximately one-quarter of the convention delegates have recently been from affiliated labour groups, after the party changed to an Every Member Vote method of electing leaders in leadership races, labour delegate votes are scaled to 25% of the total number of ballots cast for leader.
Trudeau minority.
Under the leadership of David Lewis (1971–1975), the NDP supported the minority government formed by Pierre Trudeau's Liberals from 1972 to 1974, although the two parties never entered into a coalition. Together they succeeded in passing several socially progressive initiatives into law such as pension indexing and the creation of the crown corporation Petro-Canada.
In 1974, the NDP worked with the Progressive Conservatives to pass a motion of non-confidence, forcing an election. However, it backfired as Trudeau's Liberals regained a majority government, mostly at the expense of the NDP, which lost half its seats. Lewis lost his own riding and resigned as leader.
Height of popularity.
Under the leadership of Ed Broadbent (1975–1989), the NDP played a critical role during Joe Clark's minority government of 1979-1980, moving the non-confidence motion on John Crosbie's budget that brought down the Progressive Conservative (PC) government, and forced the election that brought Trudeau's Liberal Party back to power.
In the 1984 election, which saw the Conservatives win the most seats in Canadian history, the NDP won 30 seats, only one behind the 31 it won in 1972. The governing Liberals were decimated, falling to 40 seats in what was at the time the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level. The NDP fared far better than expected, considering the Tories won the biggest majority government in Canadian history. Third parties historically do not do well in landslide election contests. More importantly, they were only 10 seats behind the Liberals—the closest before or since the party and its predecessors had ever gotten to the two major parties up to that point, and the best performance for a third party in almost 60 years. This led to some talk that Canada was headed for a UK-style Tory-Labour division, with the NDP pushing the Liberals into oblivion. Afterwards, Broadbent himself consistently out-polled Liberal leader John Turner and even Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
On July 20, 1987, the NDP swept three by-elections in Newfoundland, Ontario, and the Yukon, picking up two formerly Conservative seats and holding one NDP seat. These by-elections brought Audrey McLaughlin to the House of Commons as the MP for Yukon.
The NDP elected a record 43 Members of Parliament (MPs) in the election of 1988. The Liberals, however, had reaped most of the benefits of opposing free trade to emerge as the dominant alternative to the ruling government. The Conservatives' barrage of attacks on the Liberals, as well as vote-splitting between the NDP and Liberals, helped them win a second consecutive majority. In 1989, Broadbent stepped down after 14 years as federal leader of the NDP.
Decline.
At the party's leadership convention, former B.C. Premier Dave Barrett and Audrey McLaughlin were the main contenders for the leadership. During the campaign, Barrett argued that the party should be concerned with western alienation, rather than focusing its attention on Quebec. The Quebec wing of the NDP strongly opposed Barrett's candidacy, with Phil Edmonston, the party's main spokesman in Quebec, threatening to resign from the party if Barrett won. Barrett's campaign was also hurt when his back-room negotiations with leadership rival Simon De Jong were inadvertently recorded by the latter's CBC microphone. In these discussions, De Jong apparently agreed to support Barrett in exchange for being named House Leader, but he changed his mind at the last minute and supported McLaughlin instead, announcing his endorsement of her before the vote. In the course of his discussion with Barrett, De Jong explained "It's a head and heart thing," i.e., that his head told him to go with Dave while his heart told him to go with Audrey. McLaughlin won the leadership on the fourth ballot, becoming the first woman in Canada to lead a political party.
Although enjoying strong support among organized labour and rural voters in the Prairies, McLaughlin tried to expand their support into Quebec without much success. In 1989, the Quebec New Democratic Party adopted a sovereigntist platform and severed its ties with the federal NDP. Under McLaughlin, the party did manage to win an election in Quebec for the first time when Edmonston won a 1990 by-election. The party had briefly picked up its first Quebec MP in 1986, when Robert Toupin crossed the floor from the Tories after briefly sitting as an independent. However, he left the party in October 1987 after claiming Communists had infiltrated the party.
The NDP chose to align itself with the Conservatives and Liberals on the "yes" side of the Charlottetown Accord referendum in 1992. Barrett reluctantly endorsed it to comply with party policy (he opposed the Meech Lake Accord in 1987), but later referred to the NDP's support for the Accord as a mistake. Edmonston, a Quebec nationalist, frequently clashed with his own party over this position on Canadian federalism, and did not run for re-election.
The NDP was routed in the 1993 election. It won only nine seats, three seats short of official party status in the House of Commons. Several factors contributed to this dramatic collapse just one election after winning a record number of seats and after being first in opinion polling at one point during the previous Parliament. One was the massive unpopularity of NDP provincial governments under Bob Rae in Ontario and Mike Harcourt in British Columbia. Not coincidentally, the NDP was routed in these provinces; it lost all 10 of its Ontario MPs and 17 of its 19 British Columbia MPs—more than half of its caucus. The Ontario NDP would be soundly defeated in 1995, while the British Columbia NDP recovered and won reelection in 1996. 
The NDP was also indirectly hampered by the collapse of the Progressive Conservatives, who were cut down to only two seats. Exit polls showed that 17% to 27% of NDP supporters from 1988 voted Liberal in 1993. It was obvious by the beginning of October that Liberal leader Jean Chrétien would be the next prime minister. However, the memory of 1988's vote splitting combined with the tremendous antipathy toward the PCs caused NDP supporters to vote Liberal to ensure the Conservatives would be defeated. Many voters in the NDP's traditional Western heartland also switched to the right-wing Reform Party of Canada. Despite sharp ideological differences, Reform's populism struck a chord with many western NDP supporters. In Ontario, fear of the Reform Party and anger at Rae helped cause NDP supporters to vote Liberal. Barrett's warnings about Western alienation proved to be prophetic, as the rise of the Reform Party replaced the NDP as the protest voice west of Ontario.
Into the 21st century.
Recovery.
The party recovered somewhat under new leader Alexa McDonough, electing 21 New Democrats in the 1997 election. The NDP made a breakthrough in Atlantic Canada, unseating Liberal ministers David Dingwall and Doug Young. The party was able to harness the discontent of Maritime voters, who were upset over cuts to employment insurance and other programs.
Afterwards, McDonough was widely perceived as trying to move the party toward the centre of the political spectrum, in the Third Way mode of Tony Blair. Union leaders were lukewarm in their support, often threatening to break away from the NDP, while Canadian Auto Workers head Buzz Hargrove called for her resignation. MPs Rick Laliberté and Angela Vautour crossed the floor to other parties during this term, reducing the NDP caucus to 19 seats.
In the November 2000 election, the NDP campaigned on the issue of Medicare but lost significant support. The governing Liberals ran an effective campaign on their economic record and managed to recapture some of the Atlantic ridings lost to the NDP in the 1997 election. The initial high electoral prospects of the Canadian Alliance under new leader Stockwell Day also hurt the NDP as many supporters strategically voted Liberal to keep the Alliance from winning. The NDP finished with 13 MPs — just barely over the threshold for official party status. 
The party embarked on a renewal process starting in 2000. A general convention in Winnipeg in November 2001 made significant alterations to party structures, and reaffirmed its commitment to the left. In the May 2002 by-elections, Brian Masse won the riding of Windsor West in Windsor, Ontario, previously held for decades by a Liberal, former Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray.
Jack Layton elected leader.
McDonough announced her resignation as party leader for family reasons in June 2002, and was succeeded by Jack Layton. A Toronto city councillor and recent President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, Layton was elected at the party's leadership election in Toronto on January 5, 2003, defeating his nearest rival, longtime Winnipeg-area MP Bill Blaikie, on the first ballot with 53.5% of the vote.
Layton had run unsuccessfully for the Commons three times in Toronto-area ridings. In contrast to traditional but diminishing Canadian practice, where an MP for a safe seat stands down to allow a newly elected leader a chance to enter Parliament, Layton did not contest a seat in Parliament until the 2004 election. In the interim, he appointed Blaikie as deputy leader and made him parliamentary leader of the NDP.
2004 election.
The 2004 election produced mixed results for the NDP. It increased its total vote by more than a million votes; however, despite Layton's optimistic predictions of reaching 40 seats, the NDP only gained five seats in the election, for a total of 19. The party was disappointed to see its two Saskatchewan incumbents defeated by the Conservatives, both in close races, perhaps due to the unpopularity of the NDP provincial government. Those losses caused the federal NDP to be shut out in Saskatchewan for the first time since the 1965 election, despite obtaining 23% of the vote in the province. 
Exit polls indicated that many NDP supporters voted Liberal to keep the new Conservative Party from winning. The Liberals had recruited several prominent NDP members, most notably former British Columbia premier Ujjal Dosanjh, to run as Liberals as part of a drive to convince NDP voters that a reunited Conservative Party could sneak up the middle in the event of a split in the centre-left vote.
The NDP campaign also experienced controversy after Layton suggested the removal of the Clarity Act, considered by some to be vital to keeping Quebec in Canada and by others as undemocratic, and promised to recognize any declaration of independence by Quebec after a referendum. Although this position was consistent with NDP policy, some high-profile party members, such as NDP House Leader Bill Blaikie, publicly indicated that they did not share this view. (Layton would later reverse his position and support the Act in 2006.)
The Liberals were re-elected, though this time as a minority government. Combined, the Liberals and NDP had 154 seats—one short of the total needed for the balance of power. As has been the case with Liberal minority governments in the past, the NDP were in a position to make gains on the party's priorities, such as fighting health care privatization, fulfilling Canada's obligation to the Kyoto Protocol, and electoral reform.
The party used Prime Minister Paul Martin's politically precarious position caused by the sponsorship scandal to force investment in multiple federal programs, agreeing not to help topple the government provided that some major concessions in the federal budget were ceded to. The governing Liberals agreed to support the changes in exchange for NDP support on confidence votes. On May 19, 2005, by Speaker Peter Milliken's tie-breaking vote, the House of Commons voted for second reading on major NDP amendments to the federal budget, preempting about $4.5 billion in corporate tax cuts and funding social, educational and environmental programs instead. Both NDP supporters and Conservative opponents of the measures branded it Canada's first "NDP budget". In late June, the amendments passed final reading and many political pundits concluded that the NDP had gained credibility and clout on the national scene.
2006 election.
On November 9, 2005, after the findings of the Gomery Inquiry were released, Layton notified the Liberal government that continued NDP support would require a ban on private health care. When the Liberals refused, Layton announced that he would introduce a motion on November 24 that would ask Martin to call a federal election in February to allow for several pieces of legislation to be passed. The Liberals turned down this offer. On November 28, 2005, Conservative leader Stephen Harper's motion of no confidence was seconded by Layton and it was passed by all three opposition parties, forcing an election. Columnist Andrew Coyne has suggested that the NDP was unlikely to receive much credit for continuing to further prop up the Liberals, so they ended their support for the Martin government.
During the election, the NDP focused their attacks on the Liberal party, in order to counter Liberal appeals for strategic voting. A key point in the campaign was when Judy Wasylycia-Leis had asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement. The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and prevented them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing Liberal corruption back into the spotlight. After the election, the RCMP announced the conclusion of the income trust investigation and laid a charge of 'Breach of Trust' against Serge Nadeau, an official in the Department of Finance, while Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale was cleared of wrongdoing.
The NDP campaign strategy put them at odds with Canadian Auto Workers, which had supported an NDP-backed Liberal minority government and which was only backing NDP candidates that had a chance of winning. After the campaign, the Ontario NDP expelled CAW leader Buzz Hargrove from the party (which has a common membership both federally and provincially) for his support of the Liberals. 
On January 23, the NDP won 29 seats, a significant increase of 10 seats from the 19 won in 2004. It was the fourth-best performance in party history, approaching the level of popular support enjoyed in the 1980s. The NDP kept all of the 18 seats it held at the dissolution of Parliament (Paul Dewar retained the riding of Ottawa Centre vacated by Broadbent). Bev Desjarlais, an NDP MP since 1997, unsuccessfully ran as an independent in her Churchill riding after losing the NDP nomination. While the party gained no seats in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, or the Prairie Provinces, it gained five seats in British Columbia, five more in Ontario and the Western Arctic riding of the Northwest Territories.
Conservative minority.
The Conservative Party won a minority government in the 2006 election, and initially the NDP was the only party that would not be able to pass legislation with the Conservatives. However, following a series of floor crossings, the NDP also came to hold the balance of power.
There have been four confidence votes in the current parliament, and the NDP is the only party to have voted against the Conservatives on all of them. These were votes on the United States-Canada softwood lumber dispute, extending the mission to Afghanistan, the 2006 Canadian federal budget and 2007 federal budget. On other issues the NDP has worked with the Conservatives. After forcing the Conservatives to agree to certain revisions, the NDP helped pass the Accountability Act. After the NDP fiercely criticized the initial Conservative attempt at a Clean Air Act, the Conservatives agreed to work with the NDP and other parties to revise the legislation. The NDP also supported the government in introducing regulations on income trusts, fearing that trends toward mass trust conversions by large corporations to avoid Canadian income taxes would cause the loss of billions of dollars in budget revenue to support health care, pensions and other federal programs. At the same time, the NDP was also weary of the threat of investor losses from income trusts’ exaggerated performance expectations.
Since that election, the NDP caucus rose to 30 members following the victory of NDP candidate Thomas Mulcair in a by-election in Outremont. This marked the second time ever (and first time in seventeen years) that the NDP won a riding in Quebec. The party won 37 seats in the 2008 federal election, the second most seats won, since the 1988 federal election record of 43.
Historical Breakthrough and Official Opposition.
In the May 2011 election, the Jack Layton lead NDP suddenly experienced a surge in the polls, catapulting them from third-party status to the role of Official Opposition for the first time in history. The historical results began as a surge in poll numbers in Quebec for the NDP, putting the party in first place in that province and in second place nationally (just a few points behind the Tories). This NDP surge (dubbed the "Orange Crush" by the media) was mirrored by a collapse in support for the Bloc Québécois in Quebec, and a collapse of support for the Liberals nationally as the progressive non-Conservative vote coalesced around the NDP. 
This resulted in the worst defeat for the Liberals in history (being reduced to just 34 seats), the worst results for the Bloc Québécois (being reduced to 4 seats), and a shift and realignment of the Canadian political landscape as the NDP (previously a third party) was returned to Parliament with an unprecedented 103 seats (59 of which came from Quebec), allowing them to form the Official Opposition and replace the Liberals as the main centre-left non-Conservative party. 
Just a few months later, in August 2011, Jack Layton died due to cancer. The subsequent leadership contest elected Thomas Mulcair (from the Quebec riding of Outremont) as the new and current leader of the New Democratic Party. 
After the election of Thomas Mulcair, multiple polls put the NDP in first place nationally (and in Quebec), ahead of the governing Conservatives. This marked the first time that the NDP was not only in first place statistically, but by such a significant margin. In Quebec, the NDP climbed to over 50% support. 
As the governing Conservatives became less and less popular, the NDP has continued to surge and hold on to first place (while the Liberals' support continued to wane). The NDP is in first place nationally, and provincially in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Yukon and, as of recently, Newfoundland and Labrador.

HMS Investigator (1848)

HMS "Investigator" was a merchant ship purchased in 1848 to search for Sir John Franklin's lost expedition. She made two voyages to the Arctic and had to be abandoned in 1853 after becoming trapped in the ice. Her wreckage was found in July 2010 on Banks Island, in the Beaufort Sea. She was the fourth ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name.
Construction and purchase.
Built at Scotts of Greenock and running 422 tonnes, "Investigator" was purchased by the Admiralty in February 1848 and was fitted for Arctic exploration by R. & H. Green at Blackwall Yard.
She was strengthened for Arctic service by William M. Rice, Master Shipwright of Woolwich Dockyard. She was extensively strengthened with timber (teak, English oak, Canadian elm) and inch (8 mm) steel plating. Ten pairs of iron diagonal riders were set in the hold, with ten pairs of diagonal plates on the sides of the vessel between decks. To cope with snow and ice loads, the upper decks were doubled with fir planking. Preston's Patent Ventilating Illuminators were installed to improve light and ventilation. Sylvester's Warming Apparatus, a modern stove system capable of warming the entire ship, was also employed with good results. The same or similar device had been used by William Edward Parry in 1821 to prevent condensation and aerate the lowest deck.
Career.
Later in 1848, she accompanied on James Clark Ross's expedition to find the missing Sir John Franklin. Also aboard "Investigator" on this expedition was the naturalist Edward Adams. She was commanded for the return voyage by Robert McClure, but became trapped in the ice, and was abandoned on 1853 in Mercy Bay, where she had been held for nearly three years. The following year, she was inspected by crews of the "Resolute", still frozen in, and reported to be in fair condition despite having taken on some water during the summer thaw.
Legacy.
Unlike the loss of and , the events surrounding "Investigator"s abandonment are not a mystery. McClure provided an official account of the journey, and the ship's surgeon Alexander Armstrong published an unofficial account in 1857. However, the location of the wreckage was not known for over 150 years because of difficulties reaching the area, which is inhospitable and often covered in ice.
Oral traditions of the Inuit tell stories of the ship. The abandoned ship was a source of copper and iron for the indigenous people in the area; metal nails were missing from smaller boats on the shore when they were discovered. One Inuit account from 1910 noted that "one year she had still been on the beach and the next year she was gone without a trace". When Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson reached Mercy Bay in 1915 during his voyage to the Arctic, he failed to find her remains. After meeting the Inuit who made pilgrimages to the wreckage, he suggested a link between the "Investigator"s stranding and the absence of muskoxen on Banks Island. He speculated that the Inuit had killed off the animals during their journeys to and from the wreckage over the 40 years since abandonment. The muskoxen have since repopulated the island and now number nearly 50,000.
Wreckage discovery.
In July 2010, a team of Parks Canada scientists, archaeologists, and surveyors began searching for the sunken "Investigator" in Mercy Bay at the northern tip of Aulavik National Park. It was the first expedition to search for the ship. The team arrived on Banks Island in the Beaufort Sea on and began a sonar scan of the area three days later. The ship was detected in the scan 15 minutes later. In order to confirm the discovery, the team made more than a dozen sweeps of the area over the next hour. Its remains were discovered on the shores of the island with the deck of the ship about eight metres below the surface. According to Ifan Thomas, a superintendent with Parks Canada, the ship was found "sitting upright in silt; the three masts have been removed, probably by ice". The cold arctic water prevented the outer deck from deteriorating quickly. There are no plans to raise the ship's remains, although the team will send a remotely operated underwater vehicle to take photos of the underwater portion of the ship.
A team of six Parks Canada archaeologists, led by Marc-Andre Bernier, scheduled dives on the "Investigator" site for 15 days beginning on 10 July 2011 to gather detailed photographic documentation and mapping of the wreck. This will be the first human contact with the wreck, which lies partially buried in silt 150 meters off the north shore of Banks Island.
The team will continue its search for "Terror" and "Erebus", part of Franklin's expedition, at O'Reilly Island.

Rathkeale College

Rathkeale College is a state-integrated Anglican boys secondary school on the outskirts of Masterton, New Zealand. 
History.
Rathkeale College was established in 1963 to complete the family of schools managed by the St Matthew's Schools Trust Board, which already had a girls school in St Matthews Collegiate School and a preparatory school in Hadlow School. The foundation Headmaster was E.J. Norman, a housemaster from Christ's College in Christchurch, while the deputy headmaster was Bruce Hamilton, also of Christ's. The school was established in the homestead of Rathkeale farm, previously owned by the Maunsell family. The Rathkeale homestead is now known as School House. The school was officially opened in 1963 by Governor General Brigadier Sir Bernard Fergusson. The school was officially called St. Matthew's Collegiate School for Boys, but has always been known as Rathkeale College, after the farm on which it was situated. The farm's name comes from Rathkeale in County Limerick, Ireland, where the Maunsell family was originally from.
Current.
Governance.
Rathkeale is currently owned by the Trinity Schools Trust, managed by the Trinity Schools Trust Board, chaired by John Greenwood, while the school is governed by a Board of Trustees chaired by Andrew Pottinger.
Staff.
Mr Willy Kerstern is the current Principal, with Mr M Grant Harper as Deputy Principal,and Mr Peter Haworth as Assistant Principal and Mr Benjamin Arcus as Chaplain.
Houses.
Boys are split into three houses to compete in various sporting, cultural and academic competitions. The houses were originally named after old English schools; Rugby House, Cranleigh House, and Repton House. In 2009 these were changed to Halberg, after gold medallist runner Sir Murray Halberg, Hillary, after mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, and Blake, after yachtsman Sir Peter Blake.
Sport.
Both summer and winter sport is encouraged at Rathkeale College, with a wide range of sports offered. The main summer sports are cricket and tennis, while the main winter sports are rugby, hockey and soccer. Rathkeale College has sports exchanges with Christ's College, Lindisfarne College, Hutt International Boys' School, Wanganui Collegiate and St. Patrick's College, Silverstream. Matthew Murdoch is current captain of the first eleven hockey team.
Culture.
Houses compete in a range of cultural competitions, including a House music (choral and band) competition, House haka competition, and in previous years, a House drama competition. The college also offers lessons in many musical instruments, as well as the "Viva Camerata" choir, combined with St. Matthew's Collegiate, and previously, a barbershop group. Many small drama performances are produced by drama classes or for the Shelia Winn Shakespeare Festival, as well as a major school production being produced every year, which usually alternates between dramas and musicals. Past shows have included "King Lear", "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat", "The Crucible", "Footloose", "Les Misérables" and "Twelfth Night".
Special Character.
As a State Integrated school, Rathkeale must have a "Special Character" to justify its existence. Rathkeale College's Special Character includes being single-sex, a boarding school, and having compulsory sport participation. However, the main factor is its Anglican religion. Boys attend weekly chapel services, and junior boys take religious education lessons. This special character has recently been enhanced by the purchase of a chapel for the school - St. Martin's on the Close, formerly St. Martin's Church, Mangaweka. The chapel was purchased, moved and restored by the Friends of St. Martin's Trust. Former Board of Trustees chair Robyn Prior received the Bishop's Medal from Bishop of Wellington Tom Brown for her services in acquiring and restoring the chapel.

Established in 1928 on the Islands of American Sāmoa, it reached the Western Islands and outer countries with large Sāmoan communities, such as New Zealand, America and Australia. It has over 530 churches worldwide with over 97,000 adherents.
The Samoan Assemblies of God fellowship is a registered movement under the Assemblies of God Worldwide, which together forms the largest Pentecostal movement worldwide. This Samoan fellowship of the Assemblies of God has over 300 credential ministers, over 10,000 lay preachers, and has 11 national fellowships worldwide which are Samoa, American Samoa, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Hawaii, USA, Alaska, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and Fiji.
As an international fellowship, the member denominations are entirely independent and autonomous; however, they are united by shared beliefs and history. The Assemblies originated from the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century. This revival led to the founding of the Assemblies of God in the United States in 1914. Through foreign missionary work and establishing relationships with other Pentecostal churches, the Assemblies of God expanded into a worldwide movement. It was not until 1976, however, that the world fellowship was formed. As a Pentecostal fellowship, the Assemblies of God believes in the Pentecostal distinctive of baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues.
Unlike other evangelical and charismatic Sāmoan groups, the Sāmoan Assemblies of God has rejected many traditional Samoan cultural practices. It was under the leadership of General Superintendent Pastor Max Haleck Jr. of American Samoa from 1976 to the year of his death in 2006, from there it was under the direction of the Most Reverend and Chief Apostle Dr. Samani Pulepule, who has been the superintendent of the New Zealand Samoan Assemblies of God for over 40 years. In 2011 Dr Pulepule resigned from all his posts, and his son Pastor Onesemo Pulepule is his successor, the new Samoan Assemblies of God World Chairman.
There are similar sounding organizations which are distinct from the SAOG. These include the following: Sāmoan Independent Assemblies of God, and Assembly of God Church of Sāmoa.
Beliefs.
Fundamental doctrines.
The central beliefs of the Samoan Assemblies of God are summarized in its Statement of Fundamental Truths. Numerous other Christian groups share some or all of these tenets, and some positions are considered more central to the faith than others. The following is a summary of these 16 non-negotiable Truths:
Core beliefs.
The Samoan Assemblies of God considers salvation, baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues, divine healing and the Second Coming of Christ to be its four core beliefs.
Salvation.
The Statement of Fundamental Truths states, "Man's only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God". The Assemblies of God holds the Arminian position on salvation; while it agrees with the Calvinist position that God is sovereign, at the same time, it believes that mankind has free will—free to accept or reject God's gift of salvation and eternal life. Therefore, the Assemblies of God disapproves of the doctrines of double predestination and the unconditional security of the believer which holds that once saved it is impossible for a person to be lost. Instead, the Assemblies of God believes that salvation is received and kept by faith, if faith in Christ is lost, then salvation is lost.
Baptism in the Holy Spirit.
According to the Statement of Fundamental Truths, "All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek" the baptism in the Spirit. It also states, "This was the normal experience of all in the early Christian Church". It is a separate experience from and occurs after salvation. This baptism gives to the receiver an "enduement of power for life and service, the bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry". There are four experiences listed in the Fundamental Truths that result from Spirit baptism: "overflowing fullness of the Spirit", "a deepened reverence for God", intensified consecration and dedication to God and his work, and "a more active love for Christ, for His Word and for the lost". The "initial physical sign" of having received this baptism is "speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance". This experience initiates the believer in the use of spiritual gifts.
Baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is "not" a requirement for membership or participation in an Assembly of God church. However, it is a requirement for ministerial licensing and ordination. The practical implication of this is that candidates for ministry who have not had this experience are not eligible for formal ministry. Given the congregational elements of AG polity, the culture of each Assembly of God church varies. In some churches, the practice of speaking in tongues is common while in others it rarely occurs.
An increasing minority of pastors has expressed concern that there is a lack of biblical support for the claim that Spirit baptism must always be accompanied with speaking in tongues. This concern corresponds with a decrease in the number of Assembly of God adherents reporting baptism in the Holy Spirit; according to the AG's Office of Statistics as of 2003 less than 50 percent of adherents had this experience. These challenges to the AG's traditional position were noted in a 2007 report by the AG's Spiritual Life Committee: 
Despite these challenges, the 53rd General Council in 2009 passed a resolution reaffirming the doctrine of initial physical evidence.
Divine healing.
The Assemblies of God understands divine healing to have been provided for in the atonement. Looking to scripture, such as and , the AG believes that Christians can pray for healing. Indeed, it believes scripture gives elders of the church the responsibility to pray "the prayer of faith" over the sick. It believes God can and does heal, but believes that God is sovereign and that, whether one is healed or not, a person's trust must be in God. It sees no conflict in trusting God for healing and receiving medical care. Healing testimonies regularly appear in the official publication, the "Pentecostal Evangel", and prayer for healing and testimony commonly occur in church services.
While adamant that divine healing is a reality, the AG is not dogmatic on the subject of how one is healed. Margaret Poloma summarized this view stating, "Physical healing is not certain, automatic, or subject to formula. At the same time, it remains a tenet and practice of the Assemblies of God". It rejects the view that healing is caused or influenced by positive confession, as found in Word of Faith teachings; nevertheless, given the somewhat decentralized nature of the fellowship, these teachings have influenced some congregations.
Christ's Second Coming.
The Statement of Fundamental Truths articles 13 and 14 articulate the Assemblies of God's official teaching on the return of Christ to Earth. It is a dispensationalist and premillennialist eschatology which includes the pre-Tribulation rapture of the Church—the "imminent and blessed hope". The rapture of the Church will be followed by Christ's visible return to earth and his reign of 1,000 years. This millennial reign will usher in the salvation of the nation of Israel and universal peace. The Assemblies of God is specifically opposed to the theologies and practices of universal salvation, setting dates for Christ's return, post-Tribulation rapture, and amillennialism.
Position statements.
The Assemblies of God has released statements on various issues not addressed in the Statement of Fundamental Truths. These position papers are usually written by the Doctrinal Purity Commission, a standing committee of the General Council, which reviews and responds to issues referred to it by the Executive Presbytery. Position papers are not official positions of the Assemblies of God unless recommended by the Executive Presbytery and approved by the General Council. Position statements touch on biblical, theological, and social concerns.

Egidia de Lacy, Lady of Connacht

Egidia de Lacy, Lady of Connacht (born c. 1205), was a Cambro-Norman noblewoman, the wife of Richard Mór de Burgh, 1st Baron of Connaught and Strathearn (c.1194–1242), and the mother of his seven children, including Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster. She was also known as Gille de Lacy. Egidia was the daughter of Walter II de Lacy by his second wife Margaret de Braose.
Family.
Egidia de Lacy was born at Trim Castle, (County Meath, Ireland) about 1205, the daughter of Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath and Margaret de Braose. Egidia, also known as "Gille", was one of at least six children. Her brother Gilbert de Lacy (c. 1202 – d. 1230)married Isabel Bigod, by whom he had issue. Her sister Pernel de Lacy (c.1201 – after 25 November 1288), married firstly, William St. Omer, and secondly, Ralph VI de Toeni, by whom she had issue.
Egidia'a paternal grandparents were Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, and Rohese of Monmouth, and her maternal grandparents were William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, and Maud de St. Valery.
Marriage and children.
On 21 April 1225, she married Richard Mor de Burgh (1194 –17 February 1243), Lord of Connacht (May 1227- 1242/1243), Justiciar of Ireland (1228–1232), the son of William de Burgh and More O' Brien, daughter of Donal Mor mac Turlough O' Brien, King of Thomond and Orlachan MacMurrough of Leinster. The marriage produced seven children:
Death.
Egidia died on an unknown date in Ireland.
Royal ancestor.
Egidia had many notable descendants, including Elizabeth de Burgh, Catherine Parr, Margaret de Clare, the Earls of Ormond, and many Kings and Queens of Scotland and England. She was the ancestor of both Anne Boleyn and King Henry VIII of England, the parents of Elizabeth I. Through the Royal families of England and Scotland, she became the ancestor of Royal houses all over Europe.
Egidia became:
Line of descent for the Scottish Royal family.
Line of descent for the Scottish Royal family from Egidia de Lacy to David II of Scotland:
Line of descent for the English Royal family from Egidia de Lacy to Edward IV of England:
From Edward IV descend all subsequent Kings and Queens regnant of England who followed his brother Richard III, with only 1 exception as mentioned above, as well as James V of Scotland and his descendants.
Another link exists into the Royal Windsor family through Sarah Ferguson via Wingfield, Meade, O'Brien, Fitzgerald, and then to Richard Og de Burgh, a grandson of the said Egidia de Lacy, and a greatx5-grandson of Walter de Lacey the Norman soldier. This link makes Sarah Ferguson and her ex-spouse, Queen Elizabeth II's second son Prince Andrew, Duke of York, distant cousins.

Peter pepper

"This article is about the chili pepper. For the video game character, see BurgerTime".
The peter pepper, "Capsicum annuum var. annuum", is an heirloom chili pepper that is best known for its unusual shape. It is a type of "Capsicum annuum", though it is not officially recognized as a cultivar of the species. It occurs in red and yellow varieties. The pepper is considered very rare, and its origin is unknown.
The pepper is most commonly grown in East Texas and Louisiana, although it is grown in Mexico, as well. It was first popularized in the United States by Frank X. Tolbert in his "Dallas Morning News" column about obscure local history, although he saw the pepper only once in his life. It has since been studied by horticulture experts at the University of Texas at Austin and Louisiana State University. Though it is rare, its seeds are available from some private suppliers. It is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions. The seeds have also been exported to Asian countries, including South Korea.
The pepper has often been noted for its phallic appearance when fully grown. The pepper, particularly the red variety, has been described as a "miniature replica of the circumcised male organ". The pod of the pepper is wrinkled and has a round tip with a cleft. It is approximately 3 to 4 inches in length, and 1 to 1.5 inches wide when fully mature. The pod of the pepper has also been noted for its pungency.
As it has a very high Scoville rating, the pepper has been suggested for ornamental use rather than human consumption. It is sometimes pickled, though.
It was described by Frank X. Tolbert, a Texas journalist, historian, and chili enthusiast in one of his columns called "Tolbert's Texas" he wrote for the "Dallas Morning News". Jean Andrews, in her book "Peppers: the domesticated Capsicums", states the peter pepper did have all the qualifications "to be honored by the pen" of Mr. Tolbert, who wrote about "little-known facts about little-known things that occur in little-known places in Texas". Ms. Andrews described how hard it was to get the seed of this "little-known things that occur in little-known places" that she needed to study, but eventually she got the seeds, and was amused to see how "resulting pods naturally and consistently contorted themselves into a miniature replica of the circumcised male organ."
Appearance.
The unusual appearance of some chili peppers, and peter pepper in particular, causes amusement and provides the reasoning for a descriptive names, like penis pepper. Some kind of peppers are more predisposed to produce strange shapes. Jean Andrews, in her book ""The Pepper Lady's Pocket Pepper Primer", explains, "A latent predisposition manifests itself more often when the plant is grown under unfavorable conditions." Humans use the seeds of individuals that have some special appeals to them: taste, shape, color, size, etc., to plant a new generation of the pepper. By repeating such selections over and over again, humans are able to make desired characteristics even more distinguished. Peter/Penis pepper is a product of such repeated selections.
The most pornographic pepper.
There is a general belief that eating spicy food and chili pepper in particular heats up passion, but as Jon Bonné says in an article on MSNBC, "it's a big leap from heat in the mouth to heat between the sheets." The penile shape Bonné signals is confirmed by Michael Albertson and Ellen Albertson in their book "Temptations: Igniting the Pleasure and Power of Aphrodisiacs": the pepper is what "he looks like...This very hot Latin lover likes to brag about his size and heat. (What man doesn't?)" Another name for peter pepper is "the Chilli Willy peppers". The uniquely shaped chilis have won a few awards, including the right to be called "The Most Pornographic Pepper" by "Organic Gardening Magazine".
Growing peter peppers.
In "Backwoods Home Magazine", Alice Brantley Yeager describes the process of growing peter peppers: "The best growing conditions involve a sunny spot in the garden, moderately rich soil and the same amount of water you’d give any other pepper plant when drought threatens." It is recommended to use a seed starter for a better result, but if a seed starter is not available, the seeds could be planted "in a plastic or clay pot in a sunny window".

Bouvier (grape)

Bouvier is a white wine grape and table grape planted primarily in Central Europe-most notably Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia where it is also known as Ranina.
In Austria, where it is grown on , Bouvier is primarily used for Sturm (seasonally produced semi-fermented grape must) and young-bottled wines.
Bouvier ripens very early, is resistant to frost, and gives a rather low yield. Its wines are golden yellow, mild in taste and have a Muscat aroma.
History and pedigree.
Winery owner Clotar Bouvier (1853-1930) discovered a vine of this variety in his vineyard in Herzogburg, Ober-Radkersburg (in today's Slovenia) in the year 1900. He used this vine as a basis for breeding, and after several years of selection started to sell it, after which it became widely spread over Austria-Hungary. DNA profiling has revealed Bouvier to be a crossing (probably a natural one) of a Pinot variety (which could be Pinot noir, Pinot gris or Pinot blanc) and another, unidentified variety.
Synonyms.
Bouvier is also known under the synonyms Bela Ranina, Bela Ranka, Boouvierovo Grozno, Bouvier Précoce, Bouvier Trante weisse, Bouvier Traube weisse, Bouvierovo Grozno, Bouvierovo Hrozno, Bouvierovo Ranina, Bouvierrebe, Bouviertraube, Bouviertraube weisse, Bouvieruv Hrozen, Bouvijejeva Ranka, Bovije, Buveleova Ranka, Buvie, Buvierov Hrozen, Buvije, Buvijeova Ranina, Buvijeova Ranka, Buvijeva Ranka, Buvileova Ranka, Chasselas Bouvier, Findling, Kimmig Kp 1, Précoce de Bouvier, Précoce de Bouvier bianco, Précoce de Bouvier blanc, Précoce di Bouvier bianco, Radgonska, Ranina, Ragdonska Ranina Bela, Ranina, Ranina Bela, Ranka, Sasla Buvije.

Mr. Bad Example (song)

"Mr. Bad Example" is a song composed by Warren Zevon and Jorge Calderón. It was used as the title track for the album, "Mr. Bad Example". It tells the story of a nameless con-man and thief, sung to a polka. During the events of the song, he successfully steals from a church, his father's carpet store, and even a prostitute he hired. He also has a brief stint as a lawyer, works in hair replacement, and successfully tricks aboriginals he had hired to mine for opal. The song ends with the man retiring from his dirty deals, and asking that when you meet him in the next life you wake him up for meals.

<doc id="19770252" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19770252" title="Time constant">
Time constant

In physics and engineering, the time constant, usually denoted by the Greek letter "formula_1" (tau), is the parameter characterizing the response to a step input of a first-order, linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The time constant is the main characteristic unit of a first-order LTI (linear time-invariant) system.
In the time domain, the usual choice to explore the time response is through the step response to a step input, or the impulse response to a Dirac delta function input. In the frequency domain (for example, looking at the Fourier transform of the step response, or using an input that is a simple sinusoidal function of time) the time constant also determines the bandwidth of a first-order time-invariant system, that is, the frequency at which the output signal power drops to half the value it has at low frequencies. 
The time constant also is used to characterize the frequency response of various signal processing systems – magnetic tapes, radio transmitters and receivers, record cutting and replay equipment, and digital filters – which can be modeled or approximated by first-order LTI systems. Other examples include time constant used in control systems for integral and derivative action controllers, which are often pneumatic, rather than electrical.
Time constants are a feature of the lumped system analysis (lumped capacity analysis method) for thermal systems, used when objects cool or warm uniformly under the influence of convective cooling or warming.
Physically, the constant represents the time it takes the system's step response to reach formula_2 of its final (asymptotic) value. In radioactive decay the time constant is called the decay constant (λ), and it represents both the mean lifetime of a decaying system (such as an atom) before it decays, or the time it takes for all but 36.8% of the atoms to decay. For this reason, the time constant is longer than the half-life, which is the time for only 50% of the atoms to decay.
Differential equation.
First order LTI systems are characterized by the differential equation
where τ represents the exponential decay constant and "V" is a function of time "t"
The right-hand side is the "forcing function" "f(t)" describing an external driving function of time, which can be regarded as the system "input", to which "V(t)" is the "response", or system output. Classical examples for "f(t)" are:
The Heaviside step function, often denoted by "u(t)":
the impulse function, often denoted by "δ(t)", and also the sinusoidal input function:
or
where "A" is the "amplitude" of the forcing function, "f" is the frequency in Hertz, and ω = 2π "f" is the frequency in radians per second.
Example solution.
An example solution to the differential equation with initial value "V"0 and no forcing function is
where
is the initial value of "V". Thus, the response is an exponential decay with time constant "τ".
Discussion.
Suppose
This behavior is referred to as a "decaying" exponential function. The time formula_1 (tau) is referred to as the "time constant" and can be used (as in this case) to indicate how rapidly an exponential function decays.
Here: 
Specific cases.
After a period of one time constant the function reaches e−1 = approximately 37% of its initial value. In case 4, after five time constants the function reaches a value less than 1% of its original. In most cases this 1% threshold is considered sufficient to assume that the function has decayed to zero - as a rule of thumb, in control engineering a stable system is one that exhibits such an overall damped behavior.
Relation of time constant to bandwidth.
Suppose the forcing function is chosen as sinusoidal so:
The general solution to this equation for times "t" ≥ 0 s, assuming "V(t=0) = V0" is:
For long times the decaying exponentials become negligible and the so-called steady-state solution or long-time solution is:
The magnitude of this response is:
By convention, the bandwidth of this system is the frequency where "|V∞|"2 drops to half-value, or where "ωτ "= 1. This is the usual bandwidth convention, defined as the frequency range where power drops by less than half (at most −3 dB). Using the frequency in hertz, rather than radians/s (ω = 2π"f"): 
The notation "f3dB" stems from the expression of power in decibels and the observation that half-power corresponds to a drop in the value of "|V∞|" by a factor of 1/√2 or by 3 decibels.
Thus, the time constant determines the bandwidth of this system.
Step response with arbitrary initial conditions.
Suppose the forcing function is chosen as a step input so:
with "u(t)" the Heaviside step function. The general solution to this equation for times "t" ≥ 0 s, assuming "V(t=0) = V0" is:
The long-time solution is time independent and independent of initial conditions:
The time constant remains the same for the same system regardless of the starting conditions. Simply stated, a system approaches its final, steady-state situation at a constant rate, regardless of how close it is to that value at any arbitrary starting point.
For example, consider an electric motor whose startup is well modeled by a first-order LTI system. Suppose that when started from rest, the motor takes ⅛ of a second to reach 63% of its nominal speed of 100 RPM, or 63 RPM—a shortfall of 37 RPM. Then it will be found that after the next ⅛ of a second, the motor has sped up an additional 23 RPM, which equals 63% of that 37 RPM difference. This brings it to 86 RPM—still 14 RPM low. After a third ⅛ of a second, the motor will have gained an additional 9 RPM (63% of that 14 RPM difference), putting it at 95 RPM.
In fact, given "any" initial speed s ≤ 100 RPM, ⅛ of a second later this particular motor will have gained an additional 0.63 × (100 − s) RPM.
Examples of time constants.
Time constants in electrical circuits.
In an RL circuit composed of a single resistor and inductor, the time constant "formula_1" (in seconds) is 
where "R" is the resistance (in ohms) and "L" is the inductance (in henries).
Similarly, in an RC circuit composed of a single resistor and capacitor, the time constant "formula_1" (in seconds) is:
where "R" is the resistance (in ohms) and "C" is the capacitance (in farads).
Electrical circuits are often more complex than these examples, and may exhibit multiple time constants (See Step response and Pole splitting for some examples.) In the case where feedback is present, a system may exhibit unstable, increasing oscillations. In addition, physical electrical circuits are seldom truly linear systems except for very low amplitude excitations; however, the approximation of linearity is widely used.
In digital electronic circuits another measure, the FO4 is often used. This can be converted to time constant units via the equation formula_35.
Thermal time constant.
Time constants are a feature of the lumped system analysis (lumped capacity analysis method) for thermal systems, used when objects cool or warm uniformly under the influence of convective cooling or warming. In this case, the heat transfer from the body to the ambient at a given time is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and the ambient:
where "h" is heat transfer coefficient, and "A"s is the surface area, "T(t)" = body temperature at time "t", and "T"a is the constant ambient temperature. The positive sign indicates the convention that "F" is positive when heat is "leaving" the body because its temperature is higher than the ambient temperature ("F" is an outward flux). If heat is lost to the ambient, this heat transfer leads to a drop in temperature of the body given by:
where ρ = density, "c"p = specific heat and "V" is the body volume. The negative sign indicates the temperature drops when the heat transfer is "outward" from the body (that is, when "F" > 0). Equating these two expressions for the heat transfer,
Evidently, this is a first-order LTI system that can be cast in the form:
with 
In other words, the time constant says that larger masses "ρV" and larger heat capacities "c"p lead to slower changes in temperature, while larger surface areas "A"s and better heat transfer "h" lead to faster temperature changes.
Comparison with the introductory differential equation suggests the possible generalization to time-varying ambient temperatures "T"a. However, retaining the simple constant ambient example, by substituting the variable "ΔT" ≡ ("T − T"a), one finds:
Systems for which cooling satisfies the above exponential equation are said to satisfy Newton's law of cooling. The solution to this equation suggests that, in such systems, the difference between the temperature of the system and its surroundings "ΔT" as a function of time "t", is given by:
where "ΔT"0 is the initial temperature difference, at time "t"= 0. In words, the body assumes the same temperature as the ambient at an exponentially slow rate determined by the time constant.
Time constants in neuroscience.
In an action potential (or even in a passive spread of signal) in a neuron, the time constant "formula_1" is
where "r"m is the resistance across the membrane and "c"m is the capacitance of the membrane.
The resistance across the membrane is a function of the number of open ion channels and the capacitance is a function of the properties of the lipid bilayer.
The time constant is used to describe the rise and fall of membrane voltage, where the rise is described by
and the fall is described by
where voltage is in millivolts, time is in seconds, and "formula_1" is in seconds. 
Vmax is defined as the maximum voltage attained in the action potential, where 
where "r"m is the resistance across the membrane and "I" is the current.
Setting for "t" = "formula_1" for the rise sets "V"("t") equal to 0.63"V"max. This means that the time constant is the time elapsed after 63% of "V"max has been reached
Setting for "t" = "formula_1" for the fall sets "V"("t") equal to 0.37"V"max, meaning that the time constant is the time elapsed after it has fallen to 37% of "V"max.
The larger a time constant is, the slower the rise or fall of the potential of neuron. A long time constant can result in temporal summation, or the algebraic summation of repeated potentials.
Exponential decay.
In exponential decay, such as of a radioactive isotope, the time constant can be interpreted as the mean lifetime. The half-life "T""HL" is related to the exponential time constant formula_1 by
The reciprocal of the time constant is called the decay constant, and is denoted formula_53
Meteorological sensors.
A time constant is the amount of time it takes for a meteorological sensor to respond to a rapid change in a measurand until it is measuring values within the accuracy tolerance usually expected of the sensor.
This most often applies to measurements of temperature, dewpoint temperature, humidity and air pressure. Radiosondes are especially affected due to their rapid increase in altitude.

Georg Leib

Georg Leib (9 March 1846 in Wallerstein – 1910 in Munich) was the Royal Councillor of Commerce and ran a very successful real-estate company in Munich.
Georg Leib was a scaffolding-specialist. He was the head of the Bavarian County Administration. There are two streets named after him, one in Munich and one in Haar [http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&biw=1262&bih=615&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=leibstrasse+munich+haar&fb=1&gl=us&hq=leibstrasse&hnear=0x479de1e043c869f9:0x41d25a40937a330,Haar,+Germany&cid=9861353367170055266].
After the trademark tower of Venice, (St Mark's Campanile), collapsed in 1902, Leib donated the scaffolding for it to rebuild it. The majority wanted to tear the tower down at the time. He also built the scaffolding for the Dome of Milan, (Milan Cathedral). He also built the original Thalkirchner Bridge [http://de.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0002034] - and the Sanatorium named after him in Haar, Munich. The latter was the first institution of the kind in Germany.
Georg Leib is buried in the Old Cemetery (Alter Südfriedhof) in Munich.

Catarratto

Catarratto is a white Italian wine grape planted primarily in Sicily where it is the most widely planted grape. Overproduction in recent years has led to this grape being a substantial contributor to the European wine lake problem. Catarratto can make full bodied wines with lemon notes. In the Etna DOC, the grape is often blended with Minella bianca and Carricante. 
Subvarieties and phenotypes.
Catarratto exists in different phenotypes characterised by different pruinosity, i.e., different amount of whitish "bloom" on the grape berries. When this bloom is largely absent, the grapes give a more glossy impression. "Catarratto Bianco Comune" is characterised by a high amount of bloom, while "Catarratto Bianco Lucido" has a limited amount of bloom, and is more glossy or 'lucid'. The distinction between the two was first described by the Ampelographic Commission of Palermo in 1883, which gave them their names. They are also registered as two different grape varieties in Italy, but DNA typing has shown them to be identical. Thus, the two phenotypes have resulted from massal selection of vines showing intravarietal variability of vines having been propagated vegetatively (by cuttings) from the same original seedling. A third variety or phenotype, "Catarratto Bianco Extra Lucido", with a complete absence of bloom, was selected by B. Pastena in 1971 among Catarratto Bianco Lucido vines. This was also shown to be genetically identical with the other two, as was assumed by its origin.
Pedigree.
An Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing (the same study that showed the three Catarrattos to be identical) showed a close genetic relationship between Garganega on the one hand and Catarratto and several other grape varieties on the other hand. It is therefore possible that Garganega is one of the parents of Catarratto, however, since the parents of Garganega have not been identified, the exact nature of the relationship could not be conclusively established.
Synonyms.
Catarratto is also known under the synonyms Castellaro, Cataratto Bertolaro, Catarratto Bianco Comune, Catarratto Bianco Extra Lucido, Cataratto Bianco Latino, Catarratto Bianco Lucido, Catarratto Bianco Lustro, Cataratto Bianco Nostrale, Cataratto Carteddaro, Catarratto Bertolare, Catarratto Bertolaro, Catarratto Bianco Latino, Catarratto Bianco Nostrale

<doc id="19770363" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19770363" title="Cereza">
Cereza

Cereza (Spanish for "cherry") is a white Argentine wine grape variety. Like Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, Cereza is a pink skinned variety. It is a crossing of Muscat of Alexandria and Listan negro.
History.
Like Criolla Grande, Pais and the Spanish Mission grape that was widely in North and South America, ampelographers believe the grape was likely introduced to Argentina by early Spanish settlers. By the mid to late 20th century, Cereza, Criolla and Pais together accounted for more than a third of all grapevines planted in South America. The high yields and prolific nature of the vine contributed to its spread with around 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) planted by the 1980s but since then its numbers have been slowly declining. By 2003, its numbers had dropped by nearly a quarter to 30,760 ha/76,000 acres.
Wine regions.
While the grape was once widely planted through Argentina, today it is mostly found in the San Juan province and eastern Mendoza region.
Viticulture and winemaking.
After centuries in Argentina, the Cereza vine has adapted to the hot, arid condition and with irrigation became a reliable producer of crops for harvest. Compared to the related, red-skin Criolla Grande, Cereza has a noticeably lighter, pink skin with larger berries that contribute very little color phenols during maceration. As such, the wines produced from Cereza are almost always white with some "rosés" also being produced.
Wine styles.
Cereza produces deeply colored white and "rosé" wines that are usually intended for early consumption. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the wines can be fairly "rustic" and of basic quality, especially when yields are high (and they can often be in excess of 200 hectoliters/ha). In addition to wine production, the grape is often used in the production of grape concentrate used in winemaking.
Synonyms.
Cereza is also known under the synonyms Ceresa, Ceresina, Cereza Italiana, Cerise, and Chereza.

Chasan

Chasan is a white French wine grape variety grown primarily in the Languedoc wine region. According to the Vitis International Variety Catalogue, the variety is a crossing of Listan and Pinot. However, some sources (such as wine experts Jancis Robinson and Oz Clarke) describe the grape as a crossing between Listan and Chardonnay. All sources agree, however, that the variety was created in 1958 by Paul Truel at the "Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique" (INRA) - Unité Expérimentale du Domaine de Vassal & Montpellier SupAgro. One possible source for the confusion of the grapes parentage is that a common synonym of several clones of Chardonnay are sometimes listed as "Pinot Chardonnay" and Chardonnay, itself, was a crossing of Pinot and the obscure French wine grape Gouais blanc.
Wine region.
While the grape is a recommended planting for every major French wine region except Alsace, Chasan is only planted on a limited scale in the Languedoc region where it is usually found in experimental "vin de pays" blends.
Viticulture.
Like Chardonnay, Chasan is an early budding variety and can be at risk for springtime frost. However, like the Pinot family, the variety tends to ripens late and often doesn't develop the sugars or complexity to make a varietal wine similar to either Chardonnay or most of the Pinot family of grapes.
Synonyms.
Chasan is also known under its breeding code E.M. 1527-78.

Completer

Completer or Malanstraube is a white Swiss wine grape variety grown primarily in eastern Switzerland around Graubünden. The Completer vine was once domesticated but has now become mostly feral though some Swiss winemakers will make limited quantities of wine harvested from the wild vines. Wine produced from Completer tends to be very full bodied and aromatic.
Lafnetscha.
According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, some ampelographers speculate that the Lafnetscha grape grown in the Valais region in southwest Switzerland is actually Completer of which Lafnetscha is a known synonym.
Synonyms.
Completer is also known under the synonyms Lafnaetscha, Lafnetscha, Lafnetsela, Lindauer, Malans, Malanstraube, Malanstraube Weisse, Räuschling Edelweiss, Zürichersee, Zürichseer, Zürirebe, and Zurichersee.

The terms which are used below to subsume various periods and variations of film noir are not definitive and are meant as a navigational aid rather than as critical argument. Due to the fact that the 1940s and 1950s are universally regarded as the "classic period" of American film noir, films released prior to 1940 are listed under the caption "Precursors / Early noir-like films". Films released after 1959 should generally only be listed in the list of neo-noir titles.

Ferdinand Lemaire

Ferdinand Lemaire (1832-1879) was a French librettist and poet, best known for writing the libretto of Camille Saint-Saëns's opera "Samson et Dalila".
Lemaire was a creole, originally from Martinique, and had married a cousin of Saint-Saëns's wife. Saint-Saëns had previously set two of his poems, “Souvenance” and “Tristesse”, for voice and piano. Approached by the composer to write an oratorio on the story of Samson and Delilah, Lemaire agreed, but only if the work was to be an opera.
