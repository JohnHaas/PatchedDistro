29th Ranger Battalion (United States)

The 29th Provisional Ranger Battalion was a United States Army unit in World War II. Formed in December 1942 in England as a detachment of volunteers from the 29th Infantry Division, the battalion underwent commando training under British supervision and participated in raids on German installations, mostly in concert with No. 4 Commando. The battalion was disbanded in October 1943 and its men returned to their parent units.
However, during the 1970s a single company, B Company, 1/29th Infantry, was stationed at Kelly Hill at Fort Benning, Georgia. The company, on jump status, provided aggressor support for the United States Army's Ranger Department at all three Ranger Training camps (Darby, Dalonega and Camp Rudder in Florida). The unit's personnel wore the distinctive ranger "tan beret" and those who graduated from Ranger School were authorized to sew a Ranger dress tab above the 1/29th Infantry teal blue "flash" on the beret.
The company would be integrated by the Ranger Department in the early 1980s. A story on the unit appeared in an issue of "Gung Ho Magazine" written by former B Company ranger Greg Walker.
Formation.
On Monday, 4 February 1943, ten officers and 166 enlisted men and NCOs of the 29th Infantry Division were sent to Achnacarry, Scotland. The British Commando instructors called this unit, which was undergoing Ranger training, the 2nd Ranger Battalion. However, another American unit also had that designation, so the Rangers in the battalion and the American staff officers called them the 29th Ranger Battalion, named after its division. Major Randy Millholland of the 115th Infantry Regiment, the battalion commanding officer, instructed his men to "keep their eyes and ears open and their mouths shut." Millholland, a tough, energetic officer, was widely respected. The Ranger trainees were immensely proud of their battalion and did not want to be sent back to their old units as instructors in Ranger tactics. Soon after the proud Rangers completed their training, two of them accompanied a raiding force of British Commandos during an attack on one of the Channel Islands. One of these Rangers covered the withdrawal of his group, killing three German soldiers and wounded several others. By the time of this raid, the 29th Battalion had grown to include four Ranger infantry companies and one headquarters company.
The following is from an article entitled, “29th RANGER BATTALION (Dec. 1942 – Nov. 1943)” by J. Robert Slaughter which appeared in the Twenty-Niner Newsletter in July 1993. Mr. Slaughter was a member of the Provisional Rangers. More information can be found regarding the 29th Provisional Rangers and the illustrious history of Maryland’s 29th division at the Maryland Museum of Military History, Fifth Regiment Armory, 29th Division Street, Baltimore, MD 21201. 
Many 29ers aren't aware that almost 500 volunteers from the 115th, 116th and 175th Infantry regiments were recruited into an elite hit-and-run strike force whose mission would be to gather enemy intelligence. commit disruptive sabotage or simply to raid-in-force enemy installations. This unit was called the "29th Provisional Ranger Battalion. 
There were a few men recruited from other than infantry regiments of the Division. I am aware of a young American who joined the Canadian Army in 1939 and transferred to the 29th Rangers. Lt. Ed McNabb was stationed in England and on the staff of Eighth Air Support Command when he heard of the formation. He, like many of us eagerly signed up.
In December 1942, a memo was sent to troops stationed in England, most of whom were from the 29th Infantry Division, asking for volunteers for a Provisional Ranger Battalion. Recruits weren't hard to find. Over 1,000 men readily volunteered, then had to pass rigid physical and mental examinations. That was the easy part.
After a few weeks of training at Tidworth, the candidates were sent north to Scotland for what many have said was the toughest training they ever went through. Taking the course during wintertime didn't make life any easier. The austere Commando Depot at Achnacarry House, Spean Bridge, was located in the highlands and near beautiful Loch Lochy.
Nearby green heather grew on craggy, low mountains which created a mushy, water-logged moor. Ubiquitous mountain streams tumbled downhill toward nearby deep, blue lochs. Herds of deer, sheep, and wild ponies roamed in relative peace in this wilderness. It rained often and a biting wind was constant. One has to admit the scenery was beautiful to the eye but unpleasant to the skin.
Our instructors were from Lord Lovatt's No, 4 Commando Unit and many of them were veterans of the infamous Dieppe Raid. These officers and non-commissioned officers were from the old school—very strict disciplinarians. Within a short time, half the Ranger candidates had thrown in the towel and were sent back to their original outfits. Those finishing would become proud members of the "29th Provisional Rangers."
What was the Commando concept and what had we volunteered to do? The idea of a quick-hitting, lightly armed shock force was initiated by the British in 1940. The cornerstone of the Commando concept's success was their strict standards of selection and the intensity of training. Some indication of what qualities were sought in volunteers was given in a circular sent by MO9 to the British infantry regiments in June 1940: ".. Able to swim, immune from sea and air sickness, able to drive motor vehicles, with courage, physical endurance, initiative and resourceful, being active, expert marksmen, self-reliance, and an aggressive spirit toward the war.. .and must become expert in military use of scouting...to stalk...to report everything taking place day or night, silently and unseen ...and to live off the country for considerable periods. Some of the Ranger candidates were asked, 'have you ever killed a man?' And could you 'stick a knife in a man... and twist it?'"Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall and British Combined Operations Chief Lord Louis Mountbatten first discussed the possibility of raising an American Commando-type unit. Lord Mountbatten suggested calling the force "Rangers."
A special shock-troop concept was fashioned after German "Stosstruppen" of World War I. Their elitism, discipline and fighting qualities were well-known to senior British officers. They had also studied the French and Indian War of the 1750a A force of 900 French-Canadian woodsmen and Indians defeated a hand-picked expeditionary force of 1,400 British and American regulars. The woodsmen using Indian tactics—stealth and taking advantage of cover—out-flanked the superior force. The defeat turned into a rout.
The first battalion of Rangers was recruited after General Lucian K. Truscott, CG, of the 3rd Infantry Division, reported to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 26 May 1942, that there should be an American force recruited along Commando lines. President Roosevelt had already given his support. A battalion of Rangers was raised from the 1st Infantry Division who were then stationed in Northern Ireland.
Ore thousand volunteered and were sent to Scotland for training. Five hundred survived and became Rangers. This unit pre-ceded the 29th Rangers at Achnacarry Commando Depot, and a select few went on the August 1942 Dieppe Raid with Nos. 3 and 4 Commando. They also spearheaded the invasions of North Africa, Sicily and Italy.
Soon after the 1st Rangers left the Depot, the eager 29th Ranger candidates arrived.
We were quickly introduced to British Army discipline and basic infantry training—the Commando way. We also quickly realized how well the American soldier was treated. Basic Commando training consisted of getting into top physical shape by speed marching 7–15 miles; running the toughest obstacle course in the world; mountain and cliff climbing; abseiling down cliffs and buildings; unarmed combat; plus stripped-to-the-waist physical exercises using 10-foot logs to throw around. In addition to this we had to be proficient firing our weapons; finding one's way on those desolate moors with nothing but a map and compass, and to find and cook food (living off the land). We learned to employ and defuse explosives including plastics.
The obstacle course's path was a five-mile climb up a steady grade. It had every diabolic obstacle the British could devise: negotiating 10-foot walls, log and rope bridges traversing steep ravines plus rope swings over water hazards. There was little chance of escaping the mud and water hazards. Cadre acting as umpires, graded the contestants' performances. Life-sized targets popped up requiring snap judgment. One must quickly decide whether to shoot (live ammunition) the pop-up targets or bayonet them. A miss or wrong decision could be judged fatal. Running over the muddy course caused many weapons to misfire. The entire team was required to finish on time. If an umpired judged a squad member neutralized, he had to be carried. Time was taken after the last member crossed the line. If he failed to meet the deadline, the entire team had to run the "black mile." The "black mile" was running the course on our day off—Sunday.
Nearby Ben Nevis, the highest British mountain at 4,406 feet, was a favorite climb. We once climbed two gut-wrenching mountains in one day. Some slopes were so steep one had to worry about sliding off backwards. Our instructors prodded us along and didn't allow pauses. He cautioned that once you stop, you won't be able to restart. Mountain climbing is like crossing a desert and imagining mirages. The next step poses great difficulty but the crest seems mercifully in sight. As one finally nears what appears the elusive top, another "false crest" appears, and then another and another.
This was tough duty. Our Commando instructor, Captain Hoar, a veteran of the Dieppe Raid, was a career soldier. British officers, prim and proper, carried a foot-long leather baton called a "swagger stick." It had a purpose. During a tough speed march, one of our men, unable to continue, dropped out along the road. Captain Hoar ordered the man to his feet. The soldier pleaded his inability to continue. That stick went into action around the shoulders of the "yellow-bellied-coward-that-wasn't-fit-to-breathe-fresh-air!" We also observed him rib-kicking a slacker who couldn't take one of the rigorous exercises. Both were sent packing—in disgrace.
Speed marches were a British Commando specialty that propelled the troops into quick-hitting strikes that were designed to surprise the enemy. Stealth was another tactic that made up for the heavy firepower that ordinary infantry troops employ. The terrain around Fort William was hilly. We quick-stepped uphill and double-timed down the other side.
The prescribed time for short hikes was 7 mph; longer ones, 5 mph. We traveled light—rifle, carbine, BAR, 60mm mortar, cartridge belt and light pack.
Near the conclusion of these debilitating speed-marches and just before rounding the curve up the last hill to camp, Captain Hoar would yell in his curt British brogue, "Straighten up, mytees! [mates!'] Get in step!" Camp was still a mile away, and the wail of bagpipes could be heard in the distance. The kilted pipers, standing at the entrance to camp, greeted us with one of the traditional Highland tunes. This did wonders for morale. No matter how tired we were, the sound of bagpipe music sent adrenalin flowing. With tremendous pride, we marched into camp in step and with heads held high.
Our graduation reward was a pair of "paratrooper" boots and a 3-inch felt patch sewn on an Eisenhower jacket. The patch was rainbow-shaped with red background and blue lettering, "29th RANGERS." These were visual displays of elitism and were worn with great pride and, I must say, a bit of cockiness, The 29th Rangers didn't think there was an obstacle they couldn't hurdle and were eager to prove themselves.
My chance came on my first 8-day pass to London. I was lounging in Rainbow Corner, the Red Cross retreat for American servicemen and women. A GI airborne corporal, who stood about 5'8" and weighed about 160 pounds, swaggered over. I was also a corporal at the time and about 6'5`l, weighing about 205 pounds. The cocky paratrooper looked up at me and asked in a threatening voice, "Mack, you in the 'troopers?' " I answered in the negative. I thought to myself, hell man, I'm in the 29th Rangers! He then said with authority, "Take those Goddamned boots oft!" Surprised. I wondered if he wasn't juiced even though he had a few buddies and I was alone. He wasn't drunk, he was a PARATROOPER! I answered with fire in my eyes, "why don't YOU take them off me!" He bristled menacingly and began to swing wildly. I easily stiff-armed and parried his blows, as his buddies subdued the modern-day "David."
PICTURESQUE BUDE, CORNWALL : The 29th Rangers' first home base was Bude, a beautiful seacoast village in Cornwall. Pre-war, Bude was a "holidays" resort, famous for its nice weather, beautiful beach and golf course. Our quarters were in one of the swanky ocean-side hotels. My roommate was a Marylander from the 115th whom everyone called "Smitty." Smith, I can't remember his first name]. The training was rough but living conditions and food were excellent. The weather was nice and swimming in the ocean became part of our training. Everyone sported a golden tan.
The Battalion was called on to test a variety of Army food rations. An Army fights on its stomach so it's important the meals be compact, filling, tasty and nourishing. Each company tested a particular ration with each man weighing daily and answering questionnaires. Company A tested C-rations; Company B company, K-rations; C Company, 10-in-1s; D Company, a combination of 10-in-1s and chocolate D-bars.
Ten days of grueling speed marches, averaging 25 miles a day, were designed to prove which ration was best and also to separate the men from the boys. We swore that no supplemental food would be eaten during this test. The first day was destined to be the worst—a 37mile speed march, quick-stepping 5 mph, with a five-minute break on the hour and 20 minutes for lunch. I broke in a new pair of boots during this ordeal. Blisters began to form 10 miles out. About halfway, the boots had rubbed my feet and ankles raw. My socks were not only sweaty but blood-soaked.
That night we tried to pitch tents on the wind-swept, soggy moors. The first thing I did was tend to my bloody feet which were a mess. I couldn't get the tent pegs to hold, so I sat on a folded shelter-half to keep my bottom dry and wrapped a blanket around my tired, aching body. No matter how I sat my legs began to cramp. I spent a miserable night. I had to be ready the next day or be disgraced. I persevered. My weight dropped from 205 to 170 pounds in those 10 days.
At the conclusion of the exercise, the battalion returned to Rude looking like survivors of the Bataan death march. Bedraggled and very hungry, we limped over the last hill into town. We showered and changed into clean, dry clothes and headed for the mess hall for breakfast. It was an all you-can-eat feast of powdered eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, syrup, jelly, bread and coffee. I piled my mess kit high and found a quiet place to eat. After a few bites I was full. Stomachs had shrunk. After a few days, we gained most of our weight back. They gave us the rest of the day to rest and clean equipment.
The rest break didn't last long. The very next day it was back at the grindstone. A daily dose of indoctrination on how tough we had become caused many of us to believe it. Our officers were young, smart, tough and aggressive. They seemed eager to go to war. If one couldn't measure up, he was sent back. Soon the 29th Rangers looked like an elite unit was supposed to—lean and hard.
After a few months at Bude we moved to Eastleigh, near Dartmouth in Hampshire. My billet-mate was John Kennelly, an Irish-Catholic from Waterbury, Conn. The British used the billet system to room and board detachments into private homes. Our landlady was a sixtyish widow named Mrs. Brand. For a short while Mrs. Brand became our mother away from home. She shared her meager food rations, depriving herself of the few "luxury" items such as eggs, butter, cheese and sugar. When time came to say good-by, we knew and she knew it would be the last time we would see each other. She knew the consequence of war better than we. I often wonder what became of that wonderful lady.
DOVER: The channel port of Dover was our next move. Twenty-two miles across the Strait of Dover was the enemy-held French port of Calais. Each side deployed huge artillery pieces which were sheltered in limestone caves and rolled out on railway tracks to firing positions. These cross-channel duels disrupted lives of the citizens and their commerce. Non-essential civilians and all children were evacuated. After the first shell exploded, air-raid sirens sounded and wardens herded people to shelters. Market Square, a favorite target in the center of town, was an uninhabited pile of rubble.
Servicemen occasionally were invited to dances at the Armory. Women from the British military, ATS, WAAFS and WRENS, also were invited. This night the Royal Air Force Band was playing Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey-type music and everyone was having a grand lime until the loudest explosion I had ever heard. The ground shook. The music didn't stop and everyone kept dancing. Sirens screamed but no one paid attention. Finally, helmeted whistle-blowing wardens rushed in and ushered everyone to safety. It was very orderly.
Wartime Britain's philosophy was to live each day to the fullest. Make no future plans. Make each moment count. Postpone nothing if it can be done right now. They lived each day as if it would be the last on earth. Eat, drink and be merry because tomorrow might not come. In 1943 Britain was either partying or stoically working. No one complained.
Dover was definitely a war zone. Not only did it experience cross-channel artillery duels but German bombers flew over almost nightly on their way to London and other cities. Anti-aircraft batteries were stationed throughout the countryside and on top of downtown buildings. What goes up must come back down. While on nightly training exercises flak rained down from anti-aircraft guns, bouncing off the ground like white-hot hail. Occasionally, Jerry dropped unspent bombs on Dover and the nearby countryside upon his return to der Fatherland.
Kennelly and I were billeted near downtown. One night after the Lancasters raided the continent, one of them mortally wounded, could not climb above one of the tethered barrage balloons. The roar of the cripple's engines sounded as it if was going to hit our house. The bomber snagged the balloon cable and crashed less than a block away, setting off explosions. Could actual combat be more hazardous?
Our mission in Dover was reportedly to prepare for a Dieppe-type raid-in-force. Multi-national assault units were assembled near Dover for this special secret mission. Canadian infantrymen, British and French Commandos, Royal Marine Commandos and American Rangers rehearsed day and night while waiting for the "dark-of-the-moon." We were at last going to be tested.
Without warning, an announcement was made that the 29th Rangers were to disband and rejoin their original units who were training for the invasion. Many hearts were saddened that these magnificently-trained, handpicked men with their mission unfulfilled would be scattered to the four winds. Why was this mission aborted and why were the Rangers disbanded? We were told the 2nd and 5th Rangers had been training in Florida and would replace the 29th Rangers.
Allow me to speculate. Just prior to D-Day, High Command created a bogus army which was to fool the Germans into thinking the main invasion effort would be directed across the channel in the Calais area. This ploy was to divert many divisions from Normandy. Could we have been part of that bogus army?
To answer the big question, did the 29th Rangers take part in three raids into occupied Norway and France as has been reported? Answer: I was in the Rangers from beginning to end and I never heard a former member who said he participated in a live raid. I can assure one and all, the Battalion did not participate as a unit on a live exercise. Ed McNabb, a former A Company officer, now living in San Antonio, said he was told Lt. John Dance and possibly Sergeant Toda might have. 29 Let's Go! reported the Battalion made three raids and that Lt. Col. Milholland had left his helmet on the beach. It is entirely possible individuals were selected to accompany No. 3 or 4 Commando as observers. This takes not a whit from the fact, this unit would have been outstanding in combat. It is a shame they were never used.
The 29th Rangers were in existence 11 months—December 1942 to November 1943. During that short time the Battalion left a legacy of what Ranger means. Even though they saw no combat as a unit, they were a proud and disciplined group. Much of the credit must go to the British Commando instructors, our Battalion Commander, Lt. Col. Randolph Milholland and Battalion Executive Officer, Major Lloyd Marr. Both had fine combat records with the 115th Infantry Regiment.
I have often wondered if the 29th Ranger Battalion could have accomplished the daunting D-Day task of scaling the cliffs at
Pointe du Hoc and then neutralize its gun batteries. Did we have the necessary training, leadership, luck, courage and skill to do what the 2nd Battalion Rangers did? No one will ever know for sure, but I am certain that if a way could be found to accomplish this "mission impossible," we could have.
Ends service.
After the two Rangers accompanied the Commandos, an entire company of the 29th was scheduled to raid the French coast. However, on 18 October 1943, a notice was posted stating that the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion would cease to exist. All of the battalion's Rangers were enraged. Some of them turned their fury on their huts, shooting them up. The soldiers of the 29th were returned to their original units and

Biography.
Early years (2006-2008).
The band formed in the suburb of Bayswater in Eastern Melbourne, Victoria. and were initially named Beyond Mine, aiming to meld their differing musical influences (post-hardcore acts such as Alexisonfire, Thrice, Saves the Day, Chiodos, alternative rock band Circa Survive, avant-garde such as Björk, and hardcore in the vein of As Cities Burn.
"Forfeiture EP" (2008).
They gained national attention when they won the 2008 FATE Battle of the Bands competition which featured 144 bands from all over Australia. They subsequently recorded and released their first extended play (EP) entitled "Forfeiture" through El Shaddai Records. The band also filmed a music video for the title track, shot in the decommissioned Old Geelong Gaol in Geelong, Victoria and directed by Ryan Chamley.
In mid-2008 drummer Liam Disher was kicked out, and bassist Adam Meyers also left after the Severed Ties tour with The Amity Affliction. In February 2009 Drew Allen and Sam Osborne joined the band as the new bassist and drummer, respectively.
House Vs. Hurricane embarked on their first major tour in May 2008 supporting metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada on their Australian tour. During July and August 2008 they featured on the Turn Up The Heat Tour of Australia with Gold Coast band Mourning Tide. The event was sponsored by Destroy All Lines and Atticus Clothing. They also joined the Severed Ties tour with fellow Australian bands The Amity Affliction, A Secret Death and Rex Banner.
In 2009, they opened for Welsh metalcore band Bullet for My Valentine in January and performed on the Melbourne leg of the Soundwave festival in February. The band also featured on the bill of the Pushover 09' concert in Melbourne along with fellow Australian bands Parkway Drive and Behind Crimson Eyes.
In early 2009 the band embarked on their first headlining club tour, performing along the Australian east coast and in Adelaide, supported by fellow Melbourne band City Escape and Wollongong natives Mary Jane Kelly. Following the tour's success, the band organized a second east coast headlining tour beginning in June 2009. Joining them was Adelaide band Nazarite Vow.
"Perspectives" (2008–present).
In 2008, House Vs. Hurricane announced via their MySpace page that they were currently writing new material for their upcoming full-length studio album, which was planned to be recorded by the end of 2009.
The band flew to United States in November 2009 to record their debut album with producer Brian McTernan. They spent six weeks recording at McTernan's Salad Days studio in Baltimore.
Perspectives was mixed in by Samuel Johnson (music producer) at Three Phase studios in Melbourne, Australia.
The song "Forfeiture" appeared on the compilation "Take Action! 8" on the Australian special edition, released on 15 May 2009 to roughly coincide with the Take Action! Australian Tour.
Two months after joining House Vs. Hurricane bass player Drew Allen decided to leave the band. He was replaced by Dylan Stark of the band A Fallen Theory. As seen in the "Salad Days Studio Diaries" series (posted on YouTube), the band continuously calls him "Dildo", as well as hazing him frequently. Drummer Sam Osbourne also commented that Stark is very quiet.
In January, House Vs. Hurricane signed with Australia's Shock Entertainment and released their debut studio album, "Perspectives", in Australia and New Zealand on 5 March. House Vs Hurricane have also announced a national Australian/New Zealand tour in support of their new album which starts in March. The band will receive support from Antagonist A.D., Mary Jane Kelly and Skyway, though there will be no support from these bands for Perth, Tasmania and New Zealand.
On 25 May 2010, the band announced that they must delay their New Zealand leg of the tour from July to later this year.
House Vs. Hurricane then returned to Australia in December for the first year of the festival No Sleep Til, playing with bands such as Megadeth, NOFX, Dropkick Murphys, Parkway Drive, A Day To Remember, GWAR, Atreyu, Descendents, Alkaline Trio, Frenzal Rhomb, Me First and the Gimme Gimme's, Suicide Silence, August Burns Red, Katatonia, 3 Inches of Blood, We Came As Romans & Confession.
During November 2010 the band embarked on a UK tour supporting the Alternative band Flood Of Red
Split with Joey & Chris, "Crooked Teeth" and breakup (2011–2013).
House Vs Hurricane in January 2011 posted on Myspace that they had kicked out their keyboardist Joey Fragione and that they would also be doing an Australian tour in March with Your Demise & Nazarite Vow. They also wrote they should be releasing their sophomore album in late 2011. They have started pre-production for their sophomore album.
In October 2011, the band announced that vocalist Chris Dicker was leaving the band after a national tour. His farewell show was held 9 December 2011 at EV's Youth Centre Croydon in the band's hometown.
In December 2011, it was announced that Mclerie would become a permanent member of the band Antiskeptic. However, Mclerie would still remain a full member of House Vs. Hurricane. Speaking on his addition to Antiskeptic, vocalist Andrew Kitchen stated that, "we wouldn’t even think of asking them (Mclerie and new bassist Tavis Wardlaw) to break off from either of their homes so to speak…I told Ryan that it was much much less of a commitment than House Vs Hurricane. We’re not looking at getting back to the days of fifty gigs in a year, we’re just looking at bringing it back to maybe ten or fifteen depending on what opportunities come up." 
On 12 February 2012, the band announced via their official Facebook page that in a few weeks they would be heading to The Machine Shop in NJ to record their new album, entitled 'Crooked Teeth', which was released by UNFD on 13 July 2012.

1937 PGA Championship

The 1937 PGA Championship was the 20th PGA Championship, held May 24–30 at Pittsburgh Field Club in Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania, a suburb northeast of Pittsburgh. Then a match play championship, Denny Shute won his second consecutive PGA Championship in less than seven months, defeating Harold "Jug" McSpaden in 37 holes. The previous edition in 1936 was held in November at Pinehurst, North Carolina.
Shute was 3 holes up after the morning round of the finals, but McSpaden had the lead with nine holes remaining and was 2 up with three holes to go. Shute birdied the 34th hole and McSpaden bogeyed the 35th to square up the match as they went to the 36th tee. McSpaden missed a four-foot (1.3 m) birdie putt to win and they halved the hole and went to a 37th hole. McSpaden lipped out his par-saving putt from to end the match.
Shute was the last to successfully defend his title at the PGA Championship until Tiger Woods won consecutive titles in 1999 and 2000. It was Shute's third and final major title; his first was at the British Open in 1933 at St. Andrews. 
Usually played later in the schedule, this PGA Championship was in late May, the first of three times it was held before the U.S. Open and British Open. Prior to World War II, the PGA Championship was most often played in September, but ranged from late May (1937, 1942) to early December (1929). Since 1969, it has been held in early to mid-August, except for 1971.

He was serving in the U.S. Army and had defeated the other pre-tournament favorites, Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson, in the quarterfinals and semifinals. 
Due to World War II, this was the second and final major of the year, following the Masters. None of the majors were played in 1943; the PGA Championship returned in 1944 and the other three in 1946. The field for this PGA Championship was reduced from prior years, with 32 advancing to match play, and all five rounds at 36 holes per match. This format was continued for 1944 and 1945, then returned to the pre-war match play field of 64 in 1946.
In the three previous years, Nelson had advanced to the finals, but was defeated in the 1942 semifinals by Turnesa in 37 holes. Nelson returned to the finals at the next two editions for five finals in six PGA Championships; he won two, in 1940 and 1945. Prior to his match with Nelson, Turnesa defeated Hogan 2 and 1 in the quarterfinals; after the war, Hogan won the title in 1946 and 1948.

Three Shire Heads

Three Shire Heads (also known as Three Shires Head) is the point on Axe Edge Moor where Cheshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire meet, at UK grid reference , or .
It is on the River Dane, which marks the Cheshire border in this area. On the east of the river, the border between Staffordshire and Derbyshire runs north-east for about a mile to Cheeks Hill, on the higher regions of Axe Edge Moor. From Cheeks Hill the border runs south then east to the head of the River Dove. 
The main landmark is a packhorse bridge. The bridge is Grade II-listed, and was probably constructed in the late 18th century.
Significance.
In modern times, Three Shire Heads is a landmark on various walking routes in this part of the moorlands.
The packhorse bridge and the waterfalls as the River Dane flows southwards are very picturesque, and frequently feature on calendars.
A report shows that this moorland area is of interest for its population of moths and butterflies.
The presence of the packhorse bridge shows the importance of this route for traders from nearby Flash and Hollinsclough to Macclesfield. Silk was produced at Hollinsclough, and sent to the mills at Macclesfield. Coal was mined from about 1600 on Axe Edge.

Tropical Storm Arlene (1959)

Tropical Storm Arlene was a short lived, pre-season tropical storm which made landfall on the central Louisiana coastline on May 30, causing minor damages and one fatality. Arlene developed out of a tropical wave which was first noted near the Dominican Republic on May 23. Development of the system was slow before it gained enough convection to be declared Tropical Storm Arlene on May 28. The storm slowly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) on May 30. Rapid weakening took place as the storm neared land and Arlene made landfall with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) later that night. Arlene weakened to what is now classified as a Tropical Depression early the next morning. The system degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of May 31 and fully dissipated late on June 2 while located over South Carolina.
Arlene dropped heavy rains totaling over in localized areas as it moved into the Southeast United States. The maximum rainfall amount was , recorded in Merrill, Mississippi, over a three-day period. The heavy rains caused minor flooding in Louisiana and property damage from the storm amounted to $500,000 ($3.7 million 2008 USD). One death was indirectly attributed to the storm when a man drowned in rough surf off the Texas coast.
Meteorological history.
Tropical Storm Arlene developed out of a tropical wave which was first noted near the Dominican Republic on May 23. The wave slowly developed as it moved westward through the Caribbean Sea and developed into an area of low pressure on May 25. By May 27, the low entered the Gulf of Mexico and a ship report the next day showed that the low had developed a closed low-level circulation. Early the next morning, the low was determined to have intensified into Tropical Storm Arlene, the first storm of the season, while located 300 mi (480 km) south-southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana with winds estimated at 40 mph (65 km/h). Arlene was moving towards the northwest at 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 km/h). Arlene slowly intensified throughout the day as it continued towards the northwest at 12 to 15 mph (19 to 24 km/h). On May 29, Arlene turned towards the west and its foreword motion slowed before becoming nearly stationary that night.
The storm was located 150 mi (240 km) south of Lafayette, Louisiana as it drifted northward and winds were estimated to have peaked at 50 mph (85 km/h). However, in the post-season, it was determined that Arlene peaked near landfall with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). As Arlene neared the coast, the storm began to weaken due to the interaction with land. Arlene made landfall about 40 mi (65 km) southeast of Lafayette, Louisiana at 2100 UTC (4 p.m. CST). The operational landfall intensity was 50 mph (85 km/h) but it was lowered to 45 mph (75 km/h) in the post season. Upon making landfall, Arlene became the earliest landfalling tropical cyclone in Louisiana history. Arlene weakened quickly to a tropical depression shortly after landfall. The storm further degenerated to a remnant area of low-pressure on the afternoon of May 31. The remnant of the storm lingered in the Southern United States until June 2, when it dissipated over South Carolina. Although the original low pressure system dissipated, a new, non tropical center formed further north over Virginia. This new low quickly tracked northeast, brushing the southern coast of New England before moving over Nova Scotia and losing its identity on June 3.
Preparations and impact.
The low that eventually became Arlene prompted wind warnings and small craft advisories for both coasts in southern Florida on May 27. The small craft advisory was significantly expanded the next day when the low was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene. The new warnings stretched from Sabine Pass, Texas to Saint Marks, Florida. Gale warnings were also issued upon the upgrade from Morgan City, Louisiana to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Rough seas and tides of two to four feet (0.6 to 1.2 metres)—also known as storm surge—were expected in the areas under the gale warning. By May 29, all craft were advised not to leave port in Louisiana. Memories of Hurricane Audrey led to numerous residents evacuating coastal areas upon hearing about Arlene. In Pierre, 50 families evacuated to higher grounds. Officials reported that 25 families were also evacuated from low-lying areas in Vermilion Parish. As Arlene neared landfall, the small craft advisory was canceled from Pensacola, Florida southward. The new warnings extended from Pensacola to Galveston, Texas. The gale warnings shifted more towards the west, now extending from Galveston, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana.
Arlene produced winds up to 55 mph (90 km/h) with gusts up to 75 mph (120 km/h) upon landfall. The lowest pressure recorded on land was 999.7 mbar (hPa; 29.52 inHg), which was rounded up to 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg) for the minimum pressure of the storm. Minor storm surge up to three feet was recorded at Weeks Island and Point Au Fer, Louisiana. Heavy rains fell across much of the southeastern Louisiana coastline. During a 24 hour span, of rain fell in Moisant International Airport. Roughly of water flooded the control tower at the airport, forcing traffic control workers to relocate to the new tower which was under-construction. A state maximum rainfall of fell in Houma. Along the coast, a few towns reported downed trees and electrical lines from high winds, resulting in scattered power outages.
At the height of the storm, several of the main roads in New Orleans were shut down due to flooding. At least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. In Baton Rouge, dozens of people were evacuated from a flooded home via ambulance and wagon to safer areas. In nearby Mississippi, rainfall from the storm was mainly confined to the southeastern counties; however, significant accumulations, peaking at , were recorded. Rain from the remnant low spread into Georgia. Some stream flooding and crop damage were reported but overall, the damage was minor. In all, Arlene caused $500,000 ($3.7 million 2010 USD) in damage. One death was related to Arlene; a man drowned in rough surf off the Galveston coast. After the initial low dissipated over the southeastern United States, the extratropical remnants of Arlene brought moderate rainfall to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England.

Crap Sogn Gion

Crap Sogn Gion (meaning "Saint John's stone" in Romansh) is a mountain (2,252 m) and cable car station (2,216 m) located near Flims in the Swiss canton of Graubünden. Regarding the definition used in the Alps by the Swiss Alpine Club it cannot be called a mountain (nor even a peak with a strict definition) but only a location at the end of a ridge descending from the Vorab in the Glarus Alps. 
As the location has no distinctive peak nor sudden drops in its gentle sides, it is absolutely not an impressive mountain but even more a very appropriate place to run a skiing resort. Comparing to other skiing resorts in Switzerland the missing neighbouring mountains to the south - which is the location of the giant prehistoric Flims Rockslide – make it even more exposed to the sun even at the sun's lowest orbit in deep winter.
A very small hut of the Ski Club Flims was the first building on Crap Sogn Gion, still standing there although hardly noticed. From 1962 the area was accessible by platter lift, followed 1967 by the then biggest aerial cable car with cabins to hold as much as 125 passengers, which is still in use today along with several modernised chairlifts. 
A more recent aerial cable car was built to Crap Masegn, from where another gondola lift leads to the glacier at Vorab, which made the ski resort a safe one in regards of snow even in winters of poor snowfall.
For a walk in summer you may find Crap Sogn Gion on Swisstopo Map 1194, Flims, in the 1:25'000 scale. National Maps of Switzerland are a set of official map series designed, edited and distributed by Swisstopo, the Swiss Federal Office of Topography.

Providence Grays all-time roster

The Providence Grays were a Major League Baseball franchise based in Providence, Rhode Island from to . During the team's eight seasons in the National League (NL), which then comprised eight teams, they finished third place or higher in the final standings seven times, and won the league championship in both and . Providence played their home games at the Messer Street Grounds, which was located in the Olneyville neighborhood of Providence. The Grays were officially organized on January 16, 1878 by Benjamin Douglas, who became the team's general manager. Henry Root was hired as the team president‚ and Tom Carey was initially hired to be the on-field captain, whose duties were similar to the modern-day manager. On January 21, 1878, Providence applied for membership in the NL, and was officially approved on February 6. On April 10, Root took over ownership of the team, fired Douglas for incompetence and insubordination, and hired Tom York to replace Carey as captain.
Providence was successful in signing several star players for their inaugural season: Paul Hines had played the previous four seasons with the Chicago White Stockings; Tom Carey was signed after the Hartford Dark Blues folded; Doug Allison was the catcher for the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, who had an 84-game winning streak from 1869 to 1870; and John Montgomery Ward, who was playing his first season in the major leagues. Ward had a win–loss record of 22–13 and Hines led the league in home runs, runs batted in (RBIs), and batting average as the Grays finished in third place among the six teams in the NL for the 1878 season, with a record of 33 wins, 27 losses, and 2 ties. The Grays won the NL championship in 1879, placing first among the league's eight teams with Ward winning 47 games as their starting pitcher, and the leadership of George Wright, who played second base and also managed. The team had a strong hitting line-up with Hines' league leading .357 batting average, as well as new additions Jim O'Rourke and Joe Start, who both had batting averages over .300. William Edward White, a Brown University player who played one game for the Grays on June 21, 1879, may have been the first African-American to play at the major league level; according to Peter Morris of the Society for American Baseball Research, the evidence for White is strong, but not conclusive. If this claim is true, then White pre-dated both Moses Fleetwood Walker and his brother Welday Walker, who both played for the 1884 Toledo Blue Stockings of the American Association (AA). In 1880, the Grays finished in second place among the eight NL teams, with Ward winning 39 games. On June 17 of that year, Ward pitched the second perfect game in major league history.
For the 1881 season, the Grays signed pitcher Charles Radbourn, who split the starting duties with Ward over the next two seasons. Radbourn won 25 games in 1881 and 33 more in 1882, while Ward won 18 and 19 respectively. In 1882, the Grays hired Harry Wright to be their manager, who brought back his brother George to play shortstop. They placed second in the NL standings, behind the White Stockings, for the third straight season. In 1883, the team dropped to third place, though Radbourn was credited with 48 victories and on July 25, he threw a no-hitter. Harry Wright left the team before the 1884 season, and was replaced by Frank Bancroft. On June 7, 1884, pitcher Charlie Sweeney struck out 19 batters in a nine-inning game, the unofficial record that stood until Roger Clemens surpassed that total with 20 in a game on April 29, 1986. On July 22, manager Brancroft wanted to replace Sweeney in the line-up with right fielder and alternate pitcher Cyclone Miller, but Sweeney refused the move and left the game. He was suspended without pay, but quit the team instead and signed to play for the St. Louis Maroons of the Union Association (UA). Without any other viable long-term pitching options, this result forced Radbourn to pitch nearly every game for the remainder of the season. Not only did Radbourn finish with 59 victories, an all-time record, but he also led the league in many pitching categories including strikeouts and earned run average, winning the triple crown. His leadership on the field led the team to their second and last NL championship; later besting the New York Metropolitans 3 games to zero in the 1884 World Series. The Grays' final season was in 1885, a season in which they finished at their lowest position in the standings in their history, as well as having their worst winning percentage. Following the 1885 season, the owner of the Boston Beaneaters, Arthur Soden bought the team and its players for $6000.

Fil de Cassons

Fil de Cassons (also known as "Cassonsgrat") is a mountain in the Glarus Alps, located near Flims in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland.
The southern face is referred to as "Flimserstein", dominating the appearance of the town of Flims. In its east lies Bargis from where a valley leads to its north face, while to its western face the sliding surface tears off of the biggest visible landslide in the world, Flims Rockslide. Piz Dolf is lying to the north across the Bargis valley, and to its west Piz Segnas, both showing the tectonic line of the "Glarus thrust" in its upper part, a now UNESCO world heritage. 
The easiest access to Fil de Cassons is an aerial cableway from Flims to this ridge, that actually allows also walks and an alpine experience from the cablecar for people that would not dare to walk a steep mountain path. Walking on top you will easily identify the tectonic line under your feet, as rocks turn from greenish to bright light grey on top of the wide ridge. 
For hikers aiming for more than a walk, several routes reach the high plateau and the very wide ridge, among them a historic Via Ferrata called "Pinut". One hiking route uses the ascent via Val Bargis and "Scala Mola", the path that the cows are being sent up to graze in summer. If you stay at the base of the valley of Bargis, you will hike on a path leading more or less around Fil de Cassons from east to northwest before reaching its top.
Being a ridge, there is very often hardly snow, allowing walks even in winter along at least one mile on Fil de Cassons.

Richard Kastle

Richard Kastle (born December 15, 1958) is an American classical pianist and composer.
Life and career.
He was born in Hialeah, Florida and began playing the piano at age eight in 1966, learning to play by ear. "He's a musical genius." said his former piano teacher. "I remember he walked in and played the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt after hearing it on the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon," she said. "Back then, he couldn't even read music." Kastle studied with Ivan Davis. He began composing piano concertos as a teenager while studying with Davis. He continued his studies as a piano major at the University of North Texas, where he was expelled for calling in sick on his final recital. An official at the music department recalled Kastle, but said that neither he nor anyone else could remember enough about the case to comment. Kastle said that it was his refusal to dress formally for concerts that ultimately got him expelled from the music department. He later made monthly performances at clubs in Venice and Santa Monica, California where he built a following of young, often college-age, listeners.
Performance and recording career.
Kastle made his network television debut in 1989 on CBS's "The Pat Sajak Show", after an appearance on Canadian teen show "Pilot One". He signed with Virgin Records in 1991 and released the album "Streetwise" in the same year. Kastle's television appearances include a performance and interview on The Joan Rivers Show and NBC's "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno. Kastle promoted his national tour on the episode that aired July 3, 1991. The tour included solo concerts and appearances with comedians George Carlin and Jay Leno. In 1992, he recorded his Piano Concerto No. 5, also known as the Royce Concerto,
with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London. Titanic Symphony is his third symphony and is based on the sinking of the RMS "Titanic". He conducted the premieres of his Titanic Symphony and Symphony No. 5 at Lincoln Center on November 6, 1999. Kastle has composed eight piano concertos. In 2003, he played arrangements of Beethoven's sonatas for piano and orchestra and premiered his Piano Concerto No. 8. He performs piano recitals on college campuses.
Awards.
In 1976, the mayor of Hialeah proclaimed March 30 in honor of Kastle. At the time, he was a student at Hialeah Miami-Lakes High School who had just competed successfully for a music scholarship.

Demoleon ( died circa 1190 B.C.) was a Trojan warrior. The son of Antenor and Theano, he was a tough defensive fighter that was killed by Achilles during the Trojan War.Born into a peaceful family that believed that Helen should be sent back to the Greeks, he had many siblings including Archelochus, Acamas, Glaucus, Helicaon, Laodocus, Coön, Polybus, Agenor, Iphidamas, Laodamas, Eurymachus, Hippolochus, Medon, Thersilochus, Antheus (most of whom perished during the Trojan War), and at least one sister, Crino. His father was a counselor to King Priam and his mother was a priestess of Athena. He was the grandson of Thracian king Cisseus and Telecleia, and his house was spared by the Achaeans because his family received Odysseus and Menelaus when they came to Troy as envoys. Demoleon's house was also spared by the Achaeans because his father pleaded with the Trojans to return Helen to the Greeks when Paris first stole her from Menelaus. It is believed that his family founded the city of Patavium (Padua) after fleeing Troy.
“…and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a valiant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple through his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was shed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended.” Book 10 of Homer's Iliad

Jaime Alguersuari

Jaime Víctor Alguersuari Escudero (; born 23 March 1990 in Barcelona, Spain), also known as Jaume Alguersuari (), is a Spanish racing driver best known for competing in Formula One between and , and for being the 2008 British Formula Three champion. He is the son of Jaime Alguersuari, Sr., a former motorcyclist and racing driver.
Alguersuari became the youngest Formula One driver to start a Grand Prix in history at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix – at the age of 19 years, 125 days – and in the process, became the first driver to be born in the 1990s to compete in Formula One. After losing his drive with the Toro Rosso team in late 2011, Alguersuari joined British radio station BBC Radio 5 Live to be their expert summariser for the 2012 Formula One season, alongside lead commentator James Allen.
Career.
Early years.
Alguersuari began his formula racing career, in the Italian Formula 1600 Junior Series, in 2005. In 2006, he won the Italian Formula Renault Winter Series, before finishing as runner-up to Mika Mäki in the main championship the following year.
Formula Three.
He moved up to the British Formula Three Championship for 2008, driving for the Carlin Motorsport alongside team-mates Brendon Hartley, Oliver Turvey and Sam Abay. After a season-long battle between Alguersuari, Hartley, Turvey and Sergio Pérez, Alguersuari won the final three races of the season to clinch the championship. He thus became the youngest title winner in championship history, aged 18 years and 203 days. He also deputised for the injured Mark Webber in the 2008 Race of Champions event at the Wembley Stadium in December 2008.
Formula Renault 3.5 Series.
He competed in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series in 2009, continuing with the Carlin team and with Turvey once again as his team-mate. At the time of his move to Formula One mid-season, he was eighth in the championship, with one podium finish, and was the second-highest rookie driver in the standings behind Turvey. Despite his promotion to an F1 race seat, he carried on in FR3.5. A week after his Formula One debut, Alguersuari returned to the series at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve, and scored both his first pole, and his first victory in the series. His 27-point haul for the weekend moved him from eighth to third in the championship standings. Alguersuari eventually ended up sixth, dropping from third in the final race.
Formula One (2009–2011).
Scuderia Toro Rosso.
2009.
Alguersuari took over the role of reserve driver for the Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso Formula One teams from fellow Red Bull Junior driver Brendon Hartley in the second half of the 2009 Formula One season. Less than two weeks later, race driver Sébastien Bourdais left the Toro Rosso team after the 2009 German Grand Prix and Alguersuari was immediately expected to be his successor, despite the lack of an official confirmation. Four days later, Toro Rosso announced that Alguersuari would drive for the team at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. He became the youngest ever Formula One driver at the age of 19 years and 125 days, breaking the record previously held by Mike Thackwell. He became only the seventh teenager to start a Grand Prix. Qualifying in last place following a mechanical problem, he finished the race in fifteenth, one place ahead of his teammate Sébastien Buemi. Through the rest of the season, he had little success, with his best result coming at the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he managed 14th place. At the remaining 8 races, he only finished 3 of them and retired in the other 5. During the season he also had a huge crash in the while he was attempting to chase for his first points.
2010.
Toro Rosso retained Alguersuari for the 2010 season, starting with a career-best finishes of thirteenth in Bahrain and eleventh in Australia including 22 laps battling with the 7 time world champion Michael Schumacher. In Malaysia one week later, Alguersuari scored his first ever Formula One points with a ninth-placed finish. Toro Rosso team principal Franz Tost praised Alguersuari's performance, saying the Spaniard "drove a fantastic race". Alguersuari then scored another point after finishing tenth at his home Grand Prix.
In May, Alguersuari visited the Dominican Republic with his Red Bull team and became one of the first drivers to ever drive a Formula 1 vehicle on the beaches there. In the next 14 races, he only had one more points finish, at the final race of the year in Abu Dhabi.
2011.
Toro Rosso confirmed that Alguersuari was to be retained alongside Sébastien Buemi for the 2011 season. After finishing the first two races outside the points, Alguersuari qualified inside the top ten for the first time in Formula One, with a seventh place grid start in China. Two 16th places and a retirement followed in the next three races, before taking his best Formula One placing of eighth at the , and then matching that at the . These results came at a crucial time for Alguersuari, with Daniel Ricciardo being linked to replace Alguersuari for the season. Alguersuari finished tenth at the , giving him a run of three consecutive point scoring finishes. He qualified a career best 6th at the before being forced to retire during the race after a first corner collision with Bruno Senna. Alguersuari finished in seventh place at the , improving upon his previous best of two eighth places earlier in the season. He crashed out on the penultimate lap in Singapore, but was classified in 21st place. In Korea, Alguersuari finished seventh after passing Nico Rosberg on the final lap, and added another eighth place finish in India.
Following the last race of the season in Brazil, Alguersuari won the Desafio Internacional das Estrelas karting event, organised by Felipe Massa. On 14 December 2011, Toro Rosso announced that Ricciardo and Jean-Éric Vergne would be the team's drivers in , replacing Alguersuari and Buemi.
DJ career.
In addition to driving racing cars, Alguersuari has his own recording studio in Barcelona, and is well known in Spain as a DJ, under the stage name Squire. Alguersuari headlined the 2010 Barcelona Music Conference and has played sets at clubs including Amnesia in Ibiza. His debut album "Organic Life" was released by Blanco y Negro Records on 14 September 2011, and topped the iTunes album chart five days after its release.

He was known for his roles, among others, as Eléazar in Halévy's La Juive and the title role in Rossini's Otello. He was given a contract with the Stuttgart Opera, where he sang from 1850-1872. His appearances in Vienna as Eléazar secured his international reputation.

Utah in the American Civil War

The Utah Territory during the American Civil War was far from the main operational theaters of war, but still played a role in the disposition of the United States Army, drawing manpower away from the volunteer forces and providing its share of administrative headaches for the Lincoln Administration. Although no battles were fought in the territory, the withdrawal of Union forces at the beginning of the war allowed the Indian tribes to start raiding the trails passing through Utah. As a result, units from California and Utah were assigned to protect against these raids. Mineral deposits found in Utah by California soldiers encouraged the immigration of non-Mormon settlers into Utah.
The U.S. government abandons the Utah Territory.
As the war began in early 1861, the War Department pulled the Federal troops out of the Utah Territory and reassigned them to other regions where they were more immediately needed to quell the brewing rebellion. However, the void in military presence allowed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) to regain control over the territory. Although the Mormons were the majority of settlers in the Great Salt Lake basin, the western area of the territory began to attract many non-Mormon settlers. Partly as a result of this, in March the Nevada Territory was created out of the western part of the territory. Earlier in the year, a large portion of the eastern area of the territory was reorganized as part of the newly created Colorado Territory.
In October 1861, the First Transcontinental Telegraph was completed, with Salt Lake City being the last link. Mormon leader Brigham Young was among the first to send a message, along with President Lincoln and other officials.
The return of the Union Army.
In 1862, with the ranks of the Union army swelled by more than 100,000 volunteers, the U.S. government believed it could now spare enough men to again occupy the Utah Territory. In addition, it was important to protect the overland mail route and telegraph lines along what later became known as the California Trail. Col. Patrick E. Connor marched into Utah with a regiment of California volunteers. His soldiers, of the 3rd California Infantry, constructed a small garrison just three miles (5 km) east of the Mormon stronghold of Salt Lake City. The post, named Camp Douglas for former Illinois presidential candidate and congressman Stephen A. Douglas, was officially established on October 26, 1862. Connor at once engaged in an acrimonious and bitter cold war with Brigham Young and the Mormon people, whom he accused of being disloyal and immoral. During the rest of the war, the fort served as the headquarters of the District of Utah in the Department of the Pacific.
The District of Utah was organized on August 1, covering the territories of Utah and Nevada, and Connor was appointed commanding officer. Besides the California units Connor led into the territory, the district was also defended by detachments from the 6th and 11th Ohio Cavalry, elements of the 4th U.S. Cavalry, and the 1st Nevada Cavalry Battalion.
The Shoshoni and other Native American tribal groups engaged in several small conflicts with incoming immigrant settlers in northern Utah and south-eastern Washington Territory (present day Idaho), particularly during the late 1850s and early 1860s. One incident in particular involving miners from Montana traveling through Cache Valley was enough to justify an expedition to investigate the situation further. Eager for combat, Connor marched his regiment 140 miles over the frozen winter landscape to deal with the Indians. On January 29, 1863, Connor's troops encountered the Shoshoni encampment along the Bear River. His men massacred the Indian encampment and then marched back to Utah.
Connor encouraged his men to explore the Utah region for mineral deposits, the discovery of which he believed would bring more non-Mormons into the territory, changing the balance of political power. His efforts were successful. His men discovered gold, silver, lead, and zinc deposits in Tooele County in 1864. As Connor hoped, miners began to flock to the territory. The Rush Valley Mining District was established by soldiers in the western Oquirrh Mountains and more than 100 claims were staked in the first year.
Political leadership of the Utah Territory during the Civil War.
Before the Civil War, John F. Kinney had been named as Chief Justice of the Territory of Utah by President Buchanan. He served from June 26, 1860, until March 1863. He was directly involved in the events leading up to the Morrisite War of 1862, and allowed a condemnation of Territorial Governor Stephen S. Harding to be read into the public record after Harding issued a blanket pardon for all Morrisites convicted in connection with the war. Kinney was elected as the Territory of Utah's Democratic delegate to the 38th Congress and served from March 4, 1863 until March 3, 1865.
In 1861, President Lincoln had appointed James Duane Doty to the position of Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Utah Territory. In 1863, Utah's territorial governor, Stephen Harding, was removed from office after public backlash from his criticism of the LDS Church and the practice of polygamy. Lincoln appointed Doty to the governorship shortly thereafter. As governor, Doty was able to repair the relationship between the Federal government and the territory's Mormons.
Utah Civil War units.
At the start of the Civil War, the withdrawal of Union Army forces left a void which several Indian tribes took advantage in order to start raids on the mail trails leading through the territory. To solve this, Young offered the government the services of the Nauvoo Legion, the Mormon militia organization. After discussing his offer with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Lincoln accepted the formation of a thirty man cavalry company for ninety days; this was later expanded into a 106-man company. Although the company made several efforts to track down the culprits of the raids, it never saw any military action.

Endless Love (soundtrack)

Endless Love is the name of a soundtrack album to the movie of the same name. The album was released worldwide by Mercury Records in 1981.
While the "Endless Love" movie itself didn't make history, the film's soundtrack and its theme song by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, also called "Endless Love", certainly did. The song became a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and nearly 30 years after its release still remains the best-selling single of Ross' career. The single stayed at #1 for no less than nine weeks from August 9 to October 10, 1981, making it the biggest-selling single of the year in the US. It also topped the Billboard R&B chart and the Adult Contemporary chart as well as becoming a Top ten hit single in the UK, peaking at #7 and indeed a Top ten hit in most parts of the world. The duet single was released by Motown Records worldwide since both artists were still signed to that label at the time, and in effect became the most successful single in Motown history. It however became Ross' final hit single for the label, shortly thereafter she signed a then recordbreaking $20 million deal with RCA Records. Her first album for her new label, the self-produced "Why Do Fools Fall in Love", released the same year, included a solo version of "Endless Love". The "Endless Love" soundtrack also included a second duet with Ross and Richie, "Dreaming of You", and both songs were also included as orchestral versions alongside Jonathan Tunick's original score.
While Ross' appearance on the "Endless Love" soundtrack marked the end of an era as she left Motown after twenty years on the label, Lionel Richie's work for the album instead became a new beginning in his career both as a composer, producer and an artist in his own right. The "Endless Love" single was released while he still officially was a member of the Commodores. The success of the duet encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career, releasing his debut album "Lionel Richie" in 1982 which produced another chart-topping single, "Truly", continuing the style of his ballads with the Commodores, like "Easy", "Three Times a Lady" and "Still", "Lady" composed and produced for Kenny Rogers which hit #1 in 1980, and also the two duets with Ross on the "Endless Love" soundtrack.
The soundtrack album also featured two tracks that were not originally recorded for the actual movie: KISS' "I Was Made for Lovin' You", first released on their album "Dynasty", a #11 hit on "Billboard"'s singles chart in 1979, as well as Cliff Richard's "Dreamin'", written by singer Leo Sayer and producer Alan Tarney, originally included on Richard's album "I'm No Hero" and also a Top ten hit single in the UK in 1980. Blondie's 1979 US and UK #1 hit "Heart of Glass" which also briefly appeared in the movie was not included on the soundtrack album.
The "Endless Love" soundtrack was re-released on CD by PolyGram in 1998.

Stefan Petzner (born 17 January 1981 in Lassnitz near Murau, Styria) is an Austrian politician. He was a member of the economical right Alliance for the Future of Austria "(Bündnis Zukunft Österreich, BZÖ)". Petzner is a former reporter (of the Styrian Kleine Zeitung)
and a student of journalism.
Petzner directed the election campaigns in 2006 and 2008.
In 2008 Petzner was appointed secretary general of the BZÖ.
Jörg Haider.
After Jörg Haider's death in a car accident on 11 October 2008, the party's executive committee nominated Petzner to succeed as party chairman. 
In an interview on the same day Petzner declared in tears that Jörg Haider was his "Lebensmensch", i.e. the "person of his life". 
On 19 October 2008, Petzner announced that he and Haider had been having "a relationship that went far beyond friendship" with the full knowledge of Haider's wife, Claudia. The Associated Press reported Petzner's comments as "Jörg and I were connected by something truly special. He was the man of my life ... I loved him as a best friend." The article was titled: "Was Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider gay?" Euronews ran the headline "Rumours of Joerg Haider’s secret gay life." Other reports had that “some say” Haider had died “after a furious row with the man who now claims to have been his lover.” 
Petzner's statements were criticized within the party as misleading and fit to be interpreted as insinuating a homosexual relationship between Haider and Petzner. His party's officials made a rushed attempt to limit the damage for the image of their far-Right group and banned several other interviews that were to have occurred that week.
BZÖ.
From 12 October to 19 November 2008 he served as acting party chairman and was succeeded by Herbert Scheibner. Petzner concentrated on directing the party's election campaign in the federal state Carinthia where, in March 2009, the party won a near-landslide victory taking over 45% of the vote. 
As the party's designated leader, Petzner was also expected to be elected "Klubobmann", i.e. chairman of the party's parliamentary group, but on 22 October 2008, Josef Bucher was elected instead, with Petzner becoming one of the five vice chairmen. Petzner himself was reported to have suggested Bucher, who was elected unanimously. Bucher's election was widely interpreted as the result of the rising criticism of Petzner's earlier statements.
When on 30 January 2010, after the secession of the majority of party officials and members from the Carinthian party, Bucher was elected Chairman of the newly formed Carinthian BZÖ, Petzner was unanimously elected Acting Chairman (the position Jörg Haider had held from 2005 till his death) and Vice-Chairman. 
On 8 April 2010 Petzner announced his resignation as Secretary General of the nationwide BZÖ. His simultaneous position as Acting Chairman of the Carinthian BZÖ, where after the break-away of the Freedom Party in Carinthia (FPK) a great deal of work was to be done, would require his full concentration. Only a week earlier he had disclaimed any such rumours as "attempts from a third party to disturb the Easter peace."
In March Petzner stepped down from the position as Acting Chairman (succeeded by Sigisbert Dolinschek).
He was Vice-Chairmen of Josef Bucher in the new formed Carinthian BZÖ state party till expulsion.
On 1st of October 2013 he got expelled for "party damaging behaviour" from the BZÖ after demanding Josef Buchers step down 
and criticizing the campaign after losing mayor voting shares at the Austrian legislative election 2013 to the Freedom Party.

Damned Good Show

Damned Good Show is a 2002 novel by Derek Robinson, concerning the actions of Bomber Command of the Royal Air Force in the first two years of the Second World War. It is the third book of Robinson's "RAF Quartet", which began with "Piece of Cake" in 1983 and continued with "A Good Clean Fight" in 1993. Skull Skelton, a character in those earlier novels, is one of the protagonists of "Damned Good Show." Like all of Robinson's novels, "Damned Good Show" points out the inadequacies of the pre-war establishment and the many hurdles that Bomber Command had to overcome during the course of the war, such as inadequate aircraft—in this case the Handley Page Hampden, and the inaccuracy of the night-time bombing raids on Germany.
Reception.
Kirkus Reviews in their review said "readers be warned: appealing characters get shot down and die. It's war, and Robinson never lets you forget it. Brilliant truths about smart lads in the days before smart bombs." A reviewer for The Daily Telegraph compared it to Catch-22 by Joseph Heller saying "this is terrific, rigorous stuff, full of telling research and sharp insight. It is also mordantly funny and, in its way, as loud an anti-battle cry as Catch-22."

"The Eldorado Network" is a 1979 espionage novel by Derek Robinson. Three sequels followed, "Artillery of Lies" in 1991, "Red Rag Blues" in 2006, and "Operation Bamboozle" in 2009. The novel, like all of Robinson's work, is based on fact, in this case a genuine double-agent known as "Garbo".
Plot introduction.
Set mainly in Madrid and Lisbon in 1940 and 1941, it concerns the young Spaniard Luis Cabrillo, who witnesses the bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War, and later joins the "Abwehr", or German intelligence service. He is enthusiastic and resourceful, and after completing his training he is sent to London to spy on the British -- codename: Eldorado. However, he only gets as far as Lisbon, where he rents an office, buys an almanac and a guidebook, and begins concocting misinformation to mail back to his superiors in Madrid. The "Abwehr" pays him for each report and for each agent he recruits, and before long Luis has established a network of spies from all over the British isles.
Luis's character and his audacious deception operation was closely modeled on that of Joan Pujol Garcia, code-named GARBO by the British, and ARABEL by the Germans. Uniquely he received both an Iron Cross, Second Class for his services to the German war effort (authorised by Hitler himself) and an MBE from King George VI in 1944.
While inspired by fact, and carefully researched, the novel is rich with Robinson's trademark black humour and verbal wit.

Transfer of the São Francisco River

The Transfer of the São Francisco River is a large-scale interbasin transfer to the dry sertão in the four northeastern states of Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba and Pernambuco in Brazil. The project, which was given the green light to go ahead by Brazil's government in 2005, is estimated to cost US$2 billion and is expected to improve the lives of 12m people. After legal challenges were brought against the project, the Supreme Court allowed it to go ahead in December 2007.
The project would divert 1.4% of the river's water for municipal water supply, industry and irrigation. Municipal water supply would receive priority over other uses, which would only be catered for only when the reservoir behind the Sobradinho dam on the São Francisco River, which produces much of the region's electricity, is nearly full about 40% of the time. The project actually consists of two transfers:The East axis would transfer water to the Paraíba do Norte River, while the North axis would transfer water to the Jaguaribe and Piranhas rivers. The project includes 700 km of canals and tunnels, as well as several dams. It is expected to displace almost a million people and construction is expected to take 20 years to complete.
Critics of the project argue that beneficiary states should improve management of their own water before importing it from outside the region. Bishop Luiz Flávio Cappio from Bahia also wonders why water is being exported when 3m poor live along the Sao Francisco river's course, many of them without running water and proper sanitation. He argues that the transfer “will demand huge resources that could be spent on other projects much closer to the reality of the people”. It is also being said that the project will mainly benefit richer farmers who already have irrigation infrastructure in place and not rainfed farmers that are hardest hit by drought. The alleged insufficiency of water in the Sao Francisco River itself during the dry season, and its consequent impact on aquatic ecosystems, is another argument of critics. For example, João Alves Filho, governor of the state of Sergipe, says that there are already “signs of mortality” where the river joins the sea. Marco Antônio Tavares Coelho, a prominent opponent, says that "aridity is the natural state of the sertão" and that soaking it would be like "removing ice from the North Pole". In 2001 the World Bank reportedly refused to finance the project because of its limited impact in combating poverty and drought.

Robert Besley

Robert Besley (1794–1876) was an English typographer, creator of Clarendon (typeface) in 1845 and the Lord Mayor of London in 1869.
Career.
Besley joined the Fann Street Foundry in 1838. The Fann Street Foundry was also home of typographer William Thorowgood, creator of Grotesque.
When Besley created Clarendon he had it patented, as England just passed a bill allowing that. The typeface became so popular, though, that the copyright was soon broken by people creating knock-offs. Still known as the first Registered typeface.
He then went on to become Sheriff of the City of London in 1863 and the Lord Mayor of London in 1869.

QEMSCAN

QEMSCAN is the name for an integrated automated mineralogy and petrography solution providing quantitative analysis of minerals, rocks and man-made materials. QEMSCAN is an abbreviation standing for Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy, and a registered trademark owned by FEI Company since 2009. The integrated system comprises a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with a large specimen chamber, up to four light-element Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detectors, and proprietary software controlling automated data acquisition. The offline software package iDiscover provides data processing and reporting functionality.
Mineral identification and quantification.
QEMSCAN creates phase assemblage maps of a specimen surface scanned by a high-energy accelerating electron beam along a predefined raster scan pattern. Low-count energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) are generated and provide information on the elemental composition at each measurement point. The elemental composition in combination with back-scattered electron (BSE) brightness and x-ray count rate information is converted into mineral phases. QEMSCAN data includes bulk mineralogy and calculated chemical assays. By mapping the sample surface, textural properties and contextual information such as particle and mineral grain size and shape, mineral associations, mineral liberation, elemental deportment, porosity, and matrix density can be calculated, visualized, and reported numerically. Data processing capabilities include combining multiple phases into mineral groups, resolving mixed spectra (boundary phase processing), image-based filtering, and particle-based classification. Quantitative reports can be generated for any selected number of samples, individual particles, and for particle classes sharing similar compositional and/or textural attributes, such as size fractions or rock types.
Sample types and preparation.
QEMSCAN is routinely employed in the analysis of rock- and ore-forming minerals. Sample preparation requirements include a level, dry specimen surface, coated with a thin electrically conductive layer (e.g. carbon). The sample must be stable under high vacuum conditions and the electron beam, typically 15 to 25 kV. Common sample types include 30 mm resin-impregnated blocks of drill cuttings and ore, thin sections of drill core and rocks, as well as soil samples. Very small particles such as atmospheric dust have been measured on carbon tape or filter paper. Coal samples are generally mounted in carnauba wax, providing sufficient contrast to allow for separation of the sample from the mounting medium, and subsequent measurement of coal and macerals.
Software suite.
QEMSCAN consists of proprietary software package iDiscover which consists of four software modules:
Measurement modes.
QEMSCAN consists of five customisable measurement modes
Applications.
QEMSCAN measurements can be applied in quantitative mineral characterisation of rocks, weathering products such as regolith and soils, and most man-made materials. As a result it has commercial and scientific applications in mining and mineral processing; O&G; coal; environmental sciences;, forensic geosciences; archaeology; agribusiness; built environment and planetary geology.

Jason Scott case

The Jason Scott case was a United States civil suit, brought against deprogrammer Rick Ross, two of his associates, and the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), for the abduction and failed deprogramming of Jason Scott, a member of a Pentecostalist church. Scott was eighteen years old at the time of the abduction and thus legally an adult. CAN was a co-defendant because a CAN contact person had referred Scott's mother to Rick Ross. In the trial, Jason Scott was represented by Kendrick Moxon, a prominent Scientologist attorney.
The nine-member jury unanimously held the defendants liable for conspiracy to deprive Scott of his civil rights and religious liberties. In addition, the jury held that Ross and his associates (but not CAN) "intentionally or recklessly acted in a way so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." The case resulted in an award of $875,000 in compensatory damages and punitive damages in the amount of $1,000,000 against CAN, $2,500,000 against Ross, and $250,000 against each of Ross's two accomplices. The case bankrupted the Cult Awareness Network and marked a watershed for nontraditional religions and the Christian countercult movement in North America.
Events prior to the deprogramming attempt.
In January 1991, at the time of the failed deprogramming attempt, Jason Scott, of Bellevue, Washington, was an 18-year-old member of the Life Tabernacle Church, affiliated with the United Pentecostal Church International. Scott's mother, Katherine Tonkin, had been a member of the church, but had withdrawn from it. Jason and two younger sons of hers disagreed with her decision and insisted they would remain in the church.
The two younger sons then left Tonkin's household, the youngest, aged thirteen, going to live with his grandmother, and the second-youngest, sixteen, moving in with another family from the church. Jason remained at home at first, but subsequently also moved in with his grandmother. 
Tonkin, who believed a pastor in the church had behaved inappropriately toward one of her younger sons, subsequently called the local Cult Awareness Network (CAN) hotline. The CAN contact person, Shirley Landa, referred her to Rick Ross; based on her endorsement of Ross, Tonkin retained him to deprogram her sons. At the time, Ross still performed forcible deprogrammings, a fact that Landa was aware of. Landa had had a longstanding relationship with CAN; she had founded its predecessor organization, and was a former member of CAN's board.
The deprogramming.
To facilitate the deprogramming, Ross put together a two-man "security team". The three traveled to the grandmother's home, locked the two youngest children in the basement, and following several days of argument and lecturing, the boys gave up their Pentecostal beliefs. For deprogramming Jason, Ross demanded a larger fee, in view of the fact that he was powerfully built and legally an adult, increasing the risk of prosecution. Ross hired a karate black belt named Clark Rotroff to help with the operation. One evening, as Scott returned to the family residence, he was surprised by Ross's three associates, wrestled to the ground, and dragged into a waiting van. 
Scott struggled, but was held down and handcuffed by the three men, gagged with duct tape from ear to ear, and had his ankles tied with rope. As he lay face down and with his cuffed hands beneath his body, one of the men, weighing 300 pounds, sat on top of his back. Scott's legs, upper body and back had sustained multiple bruises and abrasions from being dragged to the van across stairs, floors and a patio.
Scott was driven to a beach cottage, where the rope around his ankles was loosened sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners walked him into the house, one of the men leading him on a nylon leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that was what he was paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the bed frame.
Scott testified that he then endured five days of derogatory comments about himself, his beliefs, his girlfriend and his pastor, and diatribes by Ross about the ways in which Christianity and conservative Protestantism were wrong. He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a chance to say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.
After four days, Scott began to pretend that he had changed his mind, feigning tears and remorse, in the hope that this would in due course give him a chance to escape. The final day of his imprisonment he spent watching films on New Age religions and channeling, even though neither are related to Pentecostalism. Scott's plan ultimately worked; Ross, pleased with the apparent success of the deprogramming session, proposed that they all went out to meet with Scott's family for a celebratory dinner. In the restaurant, Scott was allowed to go the restroom by himself; he ran out and called the police, who arrested Ross and his companions on suspicion of unlawful imprisonment. Initially, the charges were dismissed.
The trials.
Criminal trial.
In 1993, two years later, criminal charges were brought against Ross and two of his associates for unlawful imprisonment during the deprogramming. At the trial, Ross's defense lawyer argued that Ross "was hired to deprogram Scott but that others who restrained Scott were not under Ross's control." The trial ended in acquittal for Ross. Jurors said "prosecutors had not proved Ross participated in restraining Scott." Grays Harbor County prosecutor Joe Wheeler said "he was surprised by the jury's verdict", arrived at after two hours of deliberation. Mark Workman and Charles Simpson pled guilty to the lesser charge of coercion and were sentenced to one-year jail terms, with all but 30 days suspended. The third associate, Clark Rotroff, also from Arizona, testified for the prosecution and was not charged.
Civil suit.
In addition to the criminal trial, a civil suit for damages was filed against Ross, the two convicted associates and CAN by Kendrick Moxon, a long-time member and counsel for the Church of Scientology, on behalf of Jason Scott. The case led to renewed debate on the deprogramming issue. At the trial, the jury was to decide whether the defendants had violated Scott's civil rights, including the right "to practice and believe in the religion of his choice, free from force, violence, threats, retaliation or intimidation." Anson Shupe appeared in the trial as an expert academic witness for Scott, giving testimony as to "the entrepreneurial nature of deprogramming and its origins in religious intolerance".
Ross's defense lawyer argued that since Scott was powerfully built, it had made sense to bring along others "for security", but that Ross's role had been "limited to counseling and providing information". "Mr. Ross had no physical contact with Mr. Scott," his attorney said. "He did what he was intended to do – provide information." CAN's defense asserted that none of CAN's leaders or employees were aware of the deprogramming.
In September 1995, a nine-member jury unanimously held the defendants liable for negligence and conspiracy to deprive Scott of his civil rights and religious liberties. In relation to the negligence charge, the jury attributed 70% of the total combined negligence to Ross, and 10% each to CAN and his two associates. In addition, the jury held the defendants, excluding CAN, liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding they "intentionally or recklessly acted in a way so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." 
The descriptions of the forcible nature of the kidnapping and deprogramming attempt seemed to have made an impact on the jury, who awarded $875,000 in compensatory damages to Jason Scott, and punitive damages in the amount of $1,000,000 against CAN, $2,500,000 against Ross, and $250,000 against each of Ross's two co-defendants. The court found that CAN volunteers routinely referred callers to deprogrammers. 
After the jury decision, Scott said "he thought the amount of the award was justified." Moxon said he thought "the decision and the large award for punitive damages set an important precedent and would deter other religious deprogrammers." United States District Judge John C. Coughenour pronounced the verdict "quite reasonable" and refused a motion to grant a new trial, stating:
CAN appealed the decision.The three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the award in April 1998, two of the three judges finding against CAN, with the third judge dissenting. In August 1998, the full 9th Circuit court voted against reconsidering the case. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal by CAN in March 1999. The judgment drove CAN, which had already been weakened by the cost of defending over 50 previous lawsuits filed by Moxon, into bankruptcy. Ross went into bankruptcy as well.
Outcome.
In November 1996, the CAN name, logo and telephone number were bought in Bankruptcy Court by another Scientologist attorney, Steven Hayes, whose partner Timothy Bowles had at one time been partners with Moxon. According to Moxon, Scott had not collected any part of his judgment at that time, as both CAN and Ross had declared bankruptcy. In early December, Scott reconciled with his mother and settled with Ross for $5,000, and 200 hours of professional services to be supplied by Ross. Moxon filed unsuccessful emergency motions alleging that Scott must have been coerced, but admitted he had no proof of this. In December 1996, Scott replaced Moxon as his attorney with Church of Scientology opponent Graham Berry. 
The settlement between Scott and Ross was leaked to the "Washington Post", which reportedly angered Scott. Berry, his new attorney, said that "it would be a mistake to assume that Scott's decision to make use of Ross' time was a vindication of Ross or his deprogramming methods," and refused to say what services Ross would supply under the agreement. Berry also pointed out that the Church of Scientology had "had a long-standing campaign to destroy the Cult Awareness Network" and asserted that the destruction of CAN had been in the interest of Moxon's main client, the Church of Scientology, rather than in Scott's interest. 
The Jason Scott case brought about the demise of the "Old CAN", marking the end of the cult wars in North America. Controversies surrounding new religious movements have continued, but the debate has mostly moved to other arenas than the courts. With the Scott decision, deprogramming came to an almost complete halt in North America, and the practice was largely given up in favor of voluntary exit counseling. Following the acquisition of the CAN name and number by Scientologists, a "New CAN" was established with their backing, which serves as an information and networking center on nontraditional religions; it is managed by former opponents of the "Old CAN".
According to religion scholar J. Gordon Melton, head of the Institute for the Study of American Religion at UC Santa Barbara, "The Scott case virtually brought deprogramming to a halt in this country" "What this judgment does . . . is cut the communication lines that allow deprogramming to go forward"

Philopappos Monument

The Philopappos Monument () is an ancient Greek mausoleum and monument dedicated to "Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos" or "Philopappus", (, 65–116 AD), a prince from the Kingdom of Commagene. It is located on Mouseion Hill in Athens, Greece, southwest of the Acropolis.
Origins.
Philopappos died in 116, and his death caused great grief to his sister Julia Balbilla, citizens of Athens and possibly to the imperial family. As a dedication to honor the memory of Philopappos, Balbilla with the citizens of Athens erected a tomb structure on Mouseion Hill near the Acropolis of Athens. His marble tomb monument is still known as the Philopappos Monument, and the hill is today known as Philopappos Hill (Λόφος Φιλοπάππου). 
The Greek geographer Pausanias ("Description of Greece", I.25.8), describes Philopappos’ grand tomb as a "monument built for a Syrian man". The monument was built on the same site where Musaios or Musaeus, a 6th-century BC priestly poet and mystical seer, was held to have been buried. The location of this tomb, opposite the Acropolis and within formal boundaries of the city, shows the high position Philopappos had within Athenian society.
Description.
Philopappos’ monument is a two-storey structure, supported by a base. On the lower level there is a frieze representing Philopappos as a consul, riding on a chariot and led by lictors. The upper level shows statues of three men: of Antiochus IV on the left, of Philopappos in the centre and of Seleucus I Nicator, now lost, on the right.
In the niche below Philopappos is an inscription in Greek: Φιλόπαππος Επιφάνους Βησαιεύς ("Philopappos, son of Epiphanes of the deme of the Besa"). This was the name Philopappos carried as an Athenian citizen. In the niche left of Philopappos, a Latin inscription records Philopappos’ titles, honors and his career as a Roman magistrate: "Caius Iulius Antiochus Philopappos, son of Caius, of the Fabian tribe, consul and Arval brother, admitted to the praetorian rank by the emperor Caesar Nerva Trajan Optimus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus". On the right niche of Philopappos once stood a Greek inscription (now only the base is preserved): Βασιλεύς Αντίοχος Φιλόπαππος Βασιλέως Επιφανούς Αντιόχου ("King Antiochus Philopappos, son of King Antiochus Epiphanes"). 
Below the statue of Antiochus IV, Philopappos' paternal grandfather, is an inscription that states "King Antiochus son of King Antiochus". This inscription honors Antiochus IV and his late father, the last independent ruler of the Kingdom of Commagene, King Antiochus III Epiphanes. When Antiochus III died in 17, Commagene was annexed by the Roman Emperor Tiberius and became a part of the Roman Empire. Below the statue of Seleucus I, the founder of the Seleucid Empire from whom the Commagene kings claimed descent, stood another inscription, now lost. The traveller Cyriacus of Ancona wrote in his memoir that underneath the inscription stated "King Seleucus Nicator, son of Antiochus".
The monument measures 9.80 m × 9.30 m, and contains Philopappos’ burial chamber. The structure is built of white Pentelic marble on a socle 3.08 m high, made of porous marble and veneered with slabs of Hymettian marble. The north side of Philopappos’ monument bears lavish architectural decorations.
Excavations and history.
In 1898, excavations were carried out at the monument and in 1899 conservation work was undertaken. Archaeologists in 1940, H. A. Thompson and J. Travlos conducted small additional excavations. Recent investigations have certified that architectural parts of Philopappos’ Monument have been used for construction of the Minaret in the Parthenon. 
Only two-thirds of the façade remains. The tomb chamber behind the façade is completely destroyed except for the base. The Philopappos Monument appeared to be intact until recently as in 1436, the traveller Cyriacus of Ancona visited the monument and wrote in his memoirs that the monument was still intact. The destruction of the monument must have occurred after this time.

Banking in Germany

Banking in Germany is a highly leveraged industry, as its average leverage ratio (assets divided by net worth) as of 11 October 2008 is 52 to 1 (while, in comparison, that of France is 28 to 1 and United Kingdom is 24 to 1); its short-term liabilities are equal to 60% of the German GDP or 167% of its national debt.
History.
Banking in Germany has a long history. From the 15th century, banking families such as Fugger, Welser and Hochstetter were international mercantile bankers and venture capitalists. The oldest bank still in existence in Germany, Berenberg Bank, was founded by Dutch brothers Hans and Paul Berenberg in 1590, and is still owned by the Berenberg family.
Market overview.
Germany has universal banking.
The private customer mostly has to choose between three kinds of banks (German "three pillar system"):
(A) private banks (including direct banks):
(B) cooperative banks:
(C) public savings banks:
Private banks are found mostly in the cities whereas cooperative and savings banks are almost everywhere, and are often exclusive in smaller villages.
ATM (Geldautomat) are on nearly every corner. However, customers mostly have to use their bank's ATM with their debit card if they don't want to pay a fee. Cash Group offers free ATM through the group.
Using a credit card (Visa/Mastercard/Diners Club/American Express) from a German bank in any German ATM generates a fee of about 3%. Most people prefer to use their EC/Maestro debit card.
Many physical payments are still made in cash, but increasingly, Germans are using their EC/Maestro.
Online payments are done mostly either with direct debit (Lastschrift) or with credit card.
Most of the banks offer a free main account (Girokonto) as long as the customer deposits a minimum amount regularly (> 1000€ income each month). Online banks such as ING-DiBa or comdirect offer cheaper service and free credit cards.

<doc id="19751589" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19751589" title="Oxford Oath">
Oxford Oath

The so-called Oxford Oath was derived from a resolution carried by students of the Oxford Union, by 275 votes to 153, on 9 February 1933 that "this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country". The resolution resulting from the King and Country debate was more commonly known as the Oxford Pledge.
Winston Churchill, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, denounced the resolution as "that abject, squalid, shameless avowal". In the knowledge that ten days beforehand Adolf Hitler had become chancellor of Germany, he continued: “I think of Germany, with its splendid clear-eyed youths marching forward on all the roads of the Reich singing their ancient songs, demanding to be conscripted into an army; eagerly seeking the most terrible weapons of war; burning to suffer and die for their fatherland. I think of Italy, with her ardent Fascisti, her renowned Chief, and stern sense of national duty. I think of France, anxious, peace-loving, pacifist to the core, but armed to the teeth and determined to survive as a great nation in the world. One can almost feel the curl of contempt upon the lips of the manhood of these peoples when they read this message sent out by Oxford University in the name of young England.”
Consequences.
The resolution "made a lot of noise in the world" and "caused reverberations around the world". It has been claimed by one Joseph Alsop that the resolution made a tremendous impression upon Hitler himself; he regularly cited it when his general staff protested against his military decisions. However, since Alsop misquoted the wording of the resolution, which he wrongly termed an "oath", he cannot be relied upon as an authority.
US oath.
On 12 April 1935 60,000 college students signed a United States equivalent of the resolution, calling it the Oxford Oath, swearing never to take up arms on behalf of king or country. At Columbia University 3,000 students took the Oath that day during a rally featuring Roger Baldwin, Reinhold Niebuhr and James Wechsler as speakers.
Disappearance.
The official framed copy of the oath was stolen in 2004.

Haven Arts is a contemporary art gallery founded in 2004 by philanthropist Barry Kostrinsky in the Mott Haven area of the South Bronx in New York City. Haven Arts is an internationally recognized project space that is at the forefront of an effort to regenerate the South Bronx, while maintaining a commitment to inhibit the destructive effects of gentrification by actively engaging community inclusiveness. The gallery primarily exhibits the work of local artists, notably Beth Brideau, Matthew Burcaw, Angel Chevrestt, Linda Cunningham, Darcy Dahl, Eric Feinblatt, Anne Humanfeld, Barry Kostrinsky, Aristides Logothetes, John Mascaro, and J.C. Rice.
Bill Aguado, 62, president of the Bronx Council on the Arts said, “I’m not necessarily against gentrification as a concept,” he said. “But I’m against it as it exploits real estate values and exploits established communities.”
The goal, both Aguado and Scott said, should not be to keep newcomers out, but to build a sustainable community that is involved with its residents and institutions, and that is focused on improving its quality of life.

Peter Francis Cox AO (4 December 1925 – 6 October 2008) was an Australian politician.
Early life.

Cox became the opposition transport spokesman in 1968 and was noted for his catchphrases. Once Labor was returned to office in May 1976, the new Premier Neville Wran appointed Cox Minister for Transport; as a result, Cox ranked third in terms of cabinet seniority.
In a cabinet reshuffle in 1984, Cox heard from the media that he had been demoted to 13th in the cabinet, as Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy. Peter Cox, was however, not discouraged by this and went on to successfully manage this portfolio and also Public Works He did not contest the 1988 election.

Calanda (mountain)

The Calanda is a mountain in the Glarus Alps with two main peaks Haldensteiner Calanda (highest) and Felsberger Calanda (2697 m), both located on the border between the cantons of St. Gallen and Graubünden in eastern Switzerland. It looms over Chur, the capital city of Graubünden.
Although other peaks with 286 metres Topographic prominence (for the Felsberger Calanda) would claim to be called mountain on their own, within this massive it is commonly spoken of only one mountain with different peaks due to its sole position - cut off by an old route of the Rhine river through Tamina Valley to its northwestern face and the actual Rhine Valley to the south and east.
The name Calanda derives from the Latin "calare", roughly meaning roll down, which refers to the ever moving southern face that can be seen at Felsberg and is still an active rock slide. 
Due to the much steeper descent to the northwesterly Tamina valley most of the mountain lies on the territory of the canton of Graubünden within the municipalities of Mastrils, Untervaz, Haldenstein, Felsberg and Tamins, whereas all of the Tamina valley side north of the territory of Tamins (which reaches north across the Kunkels pass) lies in the Canton of St. Gallen and the municipality of Pfäfers.
Some secondary peaks are called "Rossfallenspitz" and "Güllenchopf", whereas the names of "Berger Calanda" and "Taminser Calanda" do refer to points that could not really be called a peak but mark the end of a respective ridge.
On the northerly plateau of Felsberger Calanda there can be regularly seen Ibexes.
On the Haldenstein territory there is an alpine club mountain hut Calandahütte on 2073 m. 
The summits can be reached from south on a Swiss grade T3, (Felsberger Calanda T4) which requests experience in hiking and an absence of Acrophobia to a certain degree. 
At Felsberg, the local produced wine is called "Goldene Sonne", a reminder of a gold mine in the southern face of Calanda.

Abu Eesa Niamatullah

Imam Abu Eesa (, also known as Ustādh Abu Eesa Niamatullah and AE) is a British Muslim Imam and lecturer.
Background.
Abu Eesa was born "Niamatullah" in Barking, East London. His common name is in reference to his eldest son Eesa. His tribal heritage is through the Naser Kheil Pathans of the North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan.
He has lived in Manchester for over 13 years. Currently, he resides in Manchester UK
Education.
Abu Eesa completed his higher education in London. He studied Pharmacy at the University of Manchester.
He studied Anthropology at Manchester. Later he studied Arabic, Islamic Law and the Qur'an in Mauritania, Medina, Morocco, Egypt and Pakistan. His main teacher remains Sheikh Kehlan al-Jubury with whom he still continues his studies in Islamic Law and Exegesis. He has also studied Hadith under the Hadith Expert Abdullah Ibn Yusuf Al-Judai who is a prominent member of the European Council for Fatwa and Research. He is also an instructor at Almaghrib Institute.
Current activities.
Abu Eesa is a teacher and an international lecturer. He founded "Prophetic Guidance" following on from his teacher's magazine of the same name,a non-profit educational institute that aims to ""unify the various Muslim communities by disseminating classical non-sectarian Islamic knowledge, utilising the media in its various present forms"".
He was the previous Resident-Scholar of the Cheadle Muslim Association (CMA), Cheshire, England.
He is a writer online on blogs and websites, including a variety of articles found on Prophetic Guidance. He is an author of original works and a translator from the Arabic language, under the "Nahlah Foundation" publishing house. He teaches Islamic law and principles, and gives the sermon and was the resident scholar of Cheadle Mosque in his home-town of Cheadle in Cheshire.
His writings are highly regarded by a wide range of Muslim groups, from religious worship to social and political issues. He has lectured in Britain, Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and South Africa to audiences of Muslims and non-Muslims.
Abu Eesa teaches the Islam Channel televised class "al-Adab al-Mufrad" (The Book of Manners), and is the author of a detailed English commentary of the same work.
He has also been involved in various efforts to standardise the use of Islamic Finance principles amongst Western Muslims. He is a member of the C-100, a World Economic Forum (WEF) Initiative. He is of the religious leaders who attends Davos, the WEF Annual Meeting in Switzerland.
In an interview with Bloomberg during Davos 2009 on the topic of the global recession, the Imam criticized bankers, saying, "Bankers don't want redemption for the moral wrongs they've committed against humanity ... Redemption is a heavy word for Davos Man because remorse must come with sincerity and the desire to atone for the transgression. There are no sincere acts of sorrow in Davos."
He calls for increased political participation for Muslims as well as minority groups and women, yet is critical of what he sees as "over-kill" in continuing integration debate. Yet he has also cautioned against the unrestricted involvement of Muslim women in public roles, particularly the working environment.
Abu Eesa is known for his preaching of moderation and his refutations of extremist ideology, acknowledged both by Muslim and non-Muslim audiences. He is also a public commentator on social and anthropological issues affecting the Muslims, including citizenship and integration and gender issues.
He is a local fundraiser and a patron of St. Ann's Hospice in his local area of Cheadle. He completed the Great Manchester Run in 2006 raising funds for the Hospice. Abu Eesa's popularity seems to reach across the theological divides of the Sunni Madhabs, and he has been considered a reformer before his involvement with "The Pledge of Unity".
Abu Eesa was the first UK instructor for the American-based educational institute AlMaghrib and currently teaches seminars on law.
His main role currently is Resident Scholar of the 1st Ethical Charitable Trust, working on social and community issues. He works closely with Sheikh Ibrahim Mogra of the MCB for the British Rainbow project.
Politically, he was considered an active Liberal Democrat campaigner for his personal friend Patsy Calton, the previous MP for Cheadle who was succeeded by Mark Hunter upon Calton's death from breast cancer. His political involvement with the Government has been criticised, more so when he joined part of a select group of religious leaders invited to attend monthly round-table dialogues with MPs at the House of Commons organised jointly by Sadiq Khan MP and the Muslim Weekly Newspaper.

Dublin University Magazine

The Dublin University Magazine was an independent literary cultural and political magazine published in Dublin from 1833 to 1882. It started out as a magazine of political commentary but increasingly became devoted to literature.
Early days.
The year 1832 had been one of political and ecumenical upheaval: disturbances in Britain led to the Reform Act of that year, the Tithe War was raging in Ireland and the new Whig government was gaining influential supporters in Trinity College, Dublin. A number of young men associated with the College, including Isaac Butt, John Anster (translator of Goethe's Faust) and John Francis Waller decided to found a magazine with the objective of discussing the new developments and defending the Tories. Although all the founders were Trinity educated, there was no official connection with the College. The first issue appeared in January 1833.
The magazine was modelled on British magazines such as Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine and Fraser's Magazine of London, and was Protestant and Unionist in outlook. However, this did not preclude a keen interest in Irish life and letters. The publishers were William Curry Jun. and Company. Their agent for the magazine was a Scotsman, James McGlashan, who became the publisher himself in 1846. Its first editor was Charles Stanford.
Part of the cultural programme of the magazine was to counter the Catholic claim to possession of a Gaelic past by showing how Protestant minds and hearts could respond to Irish literature and history.
Through the 1830s and 1840s the chief ideologist of the magazine was Mortimer O'Sullivan, a Grand Chaplain of the Orange Order in Ireland, a role he shared with his brother Samuel. Editors during the 1840s and 1850s were James Wills, Charles Lever and John Francis Waller, all of whom also contributed articles.
At its best the magazine gave encouragement, relatively generous payment and an audience ranging beyond Ireland itself to emerging writers. It shared readers and sometimes writers with British magazines and even with the Nationalist "The Nation" (for example, the Young Irelander Michael Joseph Barry, a friend of Sheridan Le Fanu's brother William, who was arrested in 1848 on a charge of treason).
Sheridan Le Fanu.
Sheridan Le Fanu's first story appeared in the magazine in January 1835, the first of twelve instalments of the "Purcell Papers", called "The Ghost and the Bonesetter". His sister Catherine, who was sickly, also had articles published in the magazine a few years later (she died in 1841). In March and April 1843 he contributed "Spalatro", the tale of an Italian bandit, probably influenced by the death of his sister. Next to appear in the magazine were "The Mysterious Lodger", anonymously, in 1850 and "Ghost Stories of Chapelizod" the following year.
In 1861 Le Fanu purchased the magazine from Cheyne Brady and assumed the editorship. From then until the end of the decade he wrote a number of stories, usually under his own name, serialised in the magazine and then appearing in book form.
When Le Fanu bought the magazine the main contributors were Percy Fitzgerald and L. J. Trotter, both of whom were versatile writers. The content was fiction, verse, geographical articles, folklore, literature – very little attention to politics, if any at all. Seven years later there are some new contributors: Patrick Kennedy, a Catholic bookseller who became a good friend of Fanu's, Fanu's daughter, Eleanor Frances, and Nina Cole, but the content remained much the same. His daughter joined Nina Cole, Annie Robertson and Rhoda Broughton (a niece) in having articles and then books published with his help.
Other authors whose works were published in the magazine included William Carleton, Mortimer Collins, Elliot Warburton, Thomas Meredith, David Masson, William Archer Butler, James Clarence Mangan and Samuel Ferguson.

SS General (original title: SS-Generalen) is a novel by the Danish writer Sven Hassel. It was first published in 1960 and has been translated in many languages.
Written in the first person, "SS-General" is based on the adventures of a group of German penal battalion soldiers in the Battle of Stalingrad. The book describes their escape from the Stalingrad siege under the leadership of a fanatical Brigadeführer of the Waffen-SS. Like all Sven Hassel's books it contains graphic descriptions of war's brutality, as well as elements of military humor.

<doc id="19751792" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19751792" title="Denticity">
Denticity

Denticity refers to the number of atoms in a single ligand that bind to a central atom in a coordination complex. In many cases, only one atom in the ligand binds to the metal, so the denticity equals one, and the ligand is said to be monodentate (sometimes called unidentate). Ligands with more than one bonded atom are called polydentate or multidentate. The word "denticity" is derived from "dentis", the Latin word for tooth. The ligand is thought of as biting the metal at one or more linkage points. The denticity of a ligand is described with the Greek letter κ ('kappa'). For example, κ6-EDTA describes an EDTA ligand that coordinates through 6 non-contiguous atoms.
Denticity is different from hapticity because hapticity refers exclusively to ligands where the coordinating atoms are contiguous. In these cases the η ('eta') notation is used. Bridging ligands use the μ ('mu') notation.
Classes of denticity.
Polydentate ligands are chelating agents and classified by their denticity. Some atoms cannot form the maximum possible number of bonds a ligand could make. In that case one or more binding sites of the ligand are unused. Such sites can be used to form a bond with another chemical species.
Stability constants.
In general, the stability of a metal complex correlates with the denticity of the ligands. The stability of a complex is represented quantitatively in the form of Stability constants. Hexadentate ligands tend to bind metal ions more strongly than ligands of lower denticity.

David J. Hayes

David J. Hayes is a Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at Law at Stanford Law School and a Senior Fellow at the Hewlett Foundation.
From 2009 to July 2013, he was the Deputy Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of the Department of the Interior in the Obama administration. His nomination was confirmed by unanimous consent on May 20, 2009 by the United States Senate and he took office on May 22, 2009. Hayes’ confirmation was delayed, and subject to a cloture vote, based on then-Senator Bob Bennett’s (R-Utah) objections to Secretary Salazar’s cancellation of an oil and gas lease sale in Utah. During his tenure as Deputy Secretary, Hayes facilitated the development of major renewable energy projects by helping to institute permitting reforms and introducing landscape-scale planning for solar projects on public lands and wind projects in offshore waters. He oversaw the establishment of a network of climate science and regional cooperatives to address climate change impacts on resources; managed the day-to-day response to the Gulf Oil spill; negotiated a resolution of the Cobell Indian trust fund litigation and oversaw the settlement of several Indian water rights settlements; and was the point person for the Administration on water issues in California and energy issues in Alaska. After helping to develop the Administration’s response to the African wildlife trafficking crisis, the President appointed Hayes to the White House Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking.
Hayes served as Counselor to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, and then as the Senate-confirmed Deputy Secretary of the Interior, during the Clinton administration (1997–2001). Before and between his service in the Clinton and Obama administrations, Hayes practiced environmental and energy law as Global Chairman of the Environment, Land and Resources department at the firm of Latham & Watkins (1990-1997; 2001-2008). He also has served as a Senior Fellow of the World Wildlife Fund, and as a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute (the think tank affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council).
During Hayes' first tenure as Deputy Secretary of the Interior, he focused on environmental priorities, including the acquisition and protection of threatened lands (e.g., the Headwaters old-growth redwood forest in Northern California); the restoration of threatened ecosystems (e.g. the Bay-Delta ecosystem restoration project in California); the introduction of modern water management approaches in the west (e.g. the Colorado River initiatives undertaken by the Clinton administration); the negotiation of habitat conservation plans under the Endangered Species Act; energy-related issues associated with federal lands and resources (e.g. oil and gas development, hydropower licensing, etc.); and the settlement of long-standing Indian water and land disputes.
Active in the non-profit field, Hayes served as the Vice-Chairman of the national conservation group, American Rivers, and was a board member of RESOLVE, a non-profit that focuses on problem-solving in the energy and environmental fields. He is the former Chairman of the Board of the Environmental Law Institute.
During the 2007-2008 academic year, Hayes was a Consulting Professor at Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment, where he undertook a special project analyzing the regulatory challenges associated with carbon offsets. His report was published by the Center for American Progress. He is the author of dozens of journal articles on issues related to energy and the environment.
Hayes has been active in Democratic politics in the energy and environmental field. Prior to his appointment as Deputy Secretary, Hayes headed up energy and the environment agency review for President-elect Obama’s Transition Team, with responsibility over the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Energy and the EPA. He was a lead environmental and energy advisor to the Kerry campaign in 2004; acted a special emissary for Vice President Gore to advise the new President of Bolivia on sustainable development issues in 1993 and 1994; and served on the EPA Transition Team for President-elect Clinton in 1992. 
Hayes is a 1978 graduate of the Stanford Law School, and is a 1975 "summa cum laude" graduate of the University of Notre Dame. He served as Chairman of the Board of Visitors for the Stanford Law School.

South Bass Island Light

South Bass Island Light is a lighthouse on the southern end of its eponymous island in Lake Erie. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 5, 1990 and is thought to be the only lighthouse in the United States that is owned by a university - Ohio State.
History.
Increasing tourist traffic to the island in the late 1800s prompted the Lighthouse Board to approve construction of a light in 1893. The light was to help to mark the southern passage from Sandusky to Toledo, along with several other lights in the vicinity. The site chosen was Parker Point on the southwest corner of the island, and in 1895 a two-acre plot was purchased. Construction was protracted due to the failure of the original contractors to secure proper bonds, and the light was not brought into service until 1897. It is an atypical structure for its era, a large -story brick Queen Anne house with a 3-story tower built into one corner. It was fitted with a fourth order Fresnel lens, originally lit by oil, but eventually converted to electricity.
The tenure of the first keeper, Harry Riley, and his assistant, Sam Anderson, was brief. Concerns about a smallpox outbreak on the island were realized in August 1898, though as it happened the cases were mild and there were no deaths. Nevertheless, a newspaper report on September 1 told of Anderson, who had been hired just the previous month, drinking heavily out of fear of the disease and hiding himself in the lighthouse's basement, where he kept a number of snakes. He then emerged and threw himself into the lake, shouting, "God save them all." His body was recovered the following day. On the same day that this report appeared, Riley was picked up by the police in Sandusky, apparently insane. He was committed to the state mental hospital and died there the following March. Tragedy struck again in 1925, when the keeper, Charles B. Duggan, was killed in a fall from a cliff on the west side of the island.
In 1962 the light was deactivated, replaced by a steel tower standing adjacent to the old house. The lens was transferred to the Lake Erie Island Historical Museum, where it can still be seen. Five years later, the property was declared surplus. Ohio State, which maintains the Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island at nearby Put-in-Bay, saw an opportunity for expanded facilities; eventually a thirty year quit claim deed was negotiated, and when this expired in 1997, the university took permanent possession, save for the replacement light tower. An automated NOAA meteorological station was placed on the property in 1983. The lighthouse is used to house university researchers and staff; beginning in the summer of 2007 it was also made available for occasional tours. The exterior of the house is almost unaltered, and in 1990 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Diastereomeric recrystallization

Diastereomeric recrystallization is a method of chiral resolution of enantiomers from a racemic mixture. It differs from asymmetric synthesis, which aims to produce a single enantiomer from the beginning, in that diastereomeric recrystallization separates two enantiomers that have already mixed into a single solution.
The strategy of diastereomeric recrystallization involves two steps. The first step is to convert the enantiomers into diastereomers by way of a chemical reaction. A mixture of enantiomers may contain two isomers of a molecule with one chiral center. After adding a second chiral center in a determined location, the two isomers are still different, but they are no longer mirror images of each other; rather, they become diastereomers. In a prototypical example, a mixture of R and S enantiomers with one chiral center would become a mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) diastereomers. (The R-S notation is explained here.)
The second step, once the diastereomers have formed, is to separate them using recrystallization. This is possible because enantiomers have shared physical properties such as melting point and boiling point, but diastereomers have different physical properties, so they can be separated like any two different molecules.

Wagner (film)

Wagner is a 1983 film on the life of Richard Wagner. The title role was played by Richard Burton. It was directed by Tony Palmer and written by Charles Wood. The film was later released on DVD as a ten-part miniseries.
Other main roles were played by Vanessa Redgrave, Gemma Craven, Marthe Keller, Ronald Pickup, Miguel Herz-Kestranek and László Gálffi. Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir Laurence Olivier played ministers of Ludwig II of Bavaria.
The music of Wagner was specially recorded for the film, and conducted by Sir Georg Solti.
Production.
Tony Palmer's original concept of "Wagner" was as a feature film. It lasted 7 hours 46 minutes, but it was later edited down to a 5-hour version in which some characters disappeared. Later the film was screened in episodes on television. In 2011 it was re-released in a three-DVD set in its full original version as a feature film, in high definition and widescreen. It had earlier been released on videotape.
It was filmed in many authentic locations including King Ludwig II's castle of Neuschwanstein and Herrenchiemsee, and the Residenz in Munich, Germany. Other locations were in Hungary, Switzerland, Siena, Tuscany, Venice, Vienna and Dublin.
Palmer said of Burton's performance, "Even now – although there were criticisms – I can't think of anybody who could have brought it off better than he did."
Critical reception.
The film received glowing reviews from leading journals:
""Wagner" can be mentioned alongside such exceptional film biographies as "Gandhi", "Reds" and Abel Gance's "Napoléon" ... Wagner is one of the most beautifully photographed motion pictures in history."
"An absolute bulls-eye... wonderful... technically brilliant.. musically and filmically on the highest level... it will surely set out on a triumphant procession around the world."
"A monumental film... a complete work of art... truly visionary..."
"A remarkable event... hardly a minute too long... a British Film of glory... takes the screen by storm... a big spirited work"
Episode guide.
"Wagner" was released on DVD as a ten-part miniseries. Despite the fact that the separate installments are billed as episodes, only the first episode has opening credits, and only the last episode has closing credits, with all other episodes beginning and ending with abrupt scene changes.
Episode 1<br>
Wagner is a respected composer based in Dresden where he works as royal court conductor for the King of Saxony. Although his wife, Minna, enjoys their life and status, Wagner is bored with his work for the ageing king and spends most of his time writing revolutionary pamphlets against the establishment and aristocracy. Eventually, the May Uprising breaks out in which Wagner becomes an important figure. When Saxon and Prussian troops crush the uprising, Wagner becomes a wanted man and is forced to flee to Zürich. 
Episode 2<br>
After refusing to join her husband for quite some time, Minna eventually agrees to move to Zürich to be reunited with Wagner. She manages to persuade Wagner to start conducting and composing again and urges him to travel to France. In Bordeaux he meets a wealthy Scottish emigree, Mrs Taylor, who agrees to become a patron of his, although he has a brief affair with her married daughter. Upon travelling to Paris, Wagner is ordered to leave the city at once and return to Zürich. In Zürich he meets up with his good friend Franz Liszt, while also taking on a pupil, Karl Ritter, the son of another patron, Mrs Ritter.
Episode 3<br>
Wagner's health deteriorates and he suffers from various illnesses. Mathilde Wesendonck, the wife of wealthy silk merchant Otto Wesendonck, becomes yet another one of his patrons and offers him the cottage on her estate as his residence. Once installed in the cottage, Wagner begins a passionate correspondence with Mathilde, which upsets both Mathilde's husband, Otto, and Wagner's wife, Minna, who seeks solace in increasing amounts of laudanum. Wagner, who starts composing "Tristan und Isolde" for Mathilde, is also visited by his good friend Hans von Bülow, and his new bride Cosima, Liszt's daughter. After a while, Minna works up the courage to confront Wagner and Mathilde about their correspondence.
Episode 4<br>
Wagner moves to Venice to finish "Tristan und Isolde". When Karl Ritter informs him that Mrs Ritter is no longer able to provide Wagner with money, he ends their friendship and travels to Paris. In Paris he is ordered by the French emperor to stage a new version of his famous opera "Tannhäuser". However, the show is a fiasco when riots break out during the performance to protest both Wagner's break with artistic conventions (a ballet in the first act, instead of the second) and the involvement of one of his patrons, the Austrian Princess Metternich. 
Episode 5<br>
After the failure in Paris, Wagner travels around Europe to Switzerland, Austria and Russia. He tries staging "Tristan und Isolde" in Vienna, but is unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Minna continues to plead with the Dresden court for amnesty for Richard, which is eventually granted. Wagner returns but is chased away when creditors come looking for him. Destitute, Wagner tries to hide but is eventually found by Pfistermeister, personal secretary to the King of Bavaria who is desperate to meet him.
Episode 6<br>
Wagner enjoys a prosperous time under the patronage of the young King of Bavaria. Most of his debts are settled and several of his operas are staged to great success. Meanwhile, Wagner has an affair with Cosima, wife of his good friend Hans von Bülow, much to the dismay of Cosima's father, Franz Liszt. Although Wagner and King Ludwig II have become close friends, the King's ministers and the people of Bavaria are weary of Wagner. Wagner eventually has a falling out with the King when he asks Ludwig to pay for a portrait of Wagner which is painted as a gift to Ludwig himself. 
Episode 7<br>
Wagner must reconcile with the King and eventually does so. Their friendship grows even stronger while Ludwig's minsters are becoming increasingly suspicious of Wagner and his ever-increasing demands for money. The premiere of "Tristan und Isolde" has to be postponed when the lead actress falls ill but finally happens a few months later. Ludwig leaves the premiere before the end to travel into the night on board the royal train. When Bavaria faces external challenges and Wagner's lifestyle becomes too extravagant for the Bavarian people, Ludwig is finally forced to banish Wagner from his country. Meanwhile, Cosima gives birth to Wagner's daughter, while Minna dies alone, neglected by Wagner. 
Episode 8<br>
Wagner moves to Lucerne with Cosima and her children. He is later joined by King Ludwig who wishes to abdicate in order to become Wagner's assistant. Wagner convinces him to return to Bavaria, where war with Prussia erupts. Hans von Bülow eventually also visits them in Lucerne, where Cosima asks him for a divorce, which he refuses. When Hans is overly tired by his work for Wagner, he leaves, and Wagner hires Hans Richter as his new assistant. They are visited by Friedrich Nietzsche. Cosima gives birth to Wagner's son.
Episode 9<br>
Wagner and Cosima are overjoyed by the birth of their son, Siegfried. Meanwhile, Germany continues its war with France, which finally realises Wagner's lifelong dream of a united Germany. Wagner marries Cosima and is ordered by Ludwig to stage his opera "Das Rheingold". When Wagner decides to postpone the opera, one day before the premiere, he and Ludwig have a falling out. Wagner is denied access to the theatre and decides to build his own opera house in Bayreuth. 
Episode 10<br>
Construction on the opera house in Bayreuth begins and his epic "Der Ring des Nibelungen" can finally be premiered. The performance is attended by Ludwig who is slowly losing his mind, while living in his gigantic new castle Neuschwanstein. Wagner and Nietzsche have a falling out over Wagner's lifestyle and ideas (including his rampant anti-semitism). Shortly before his death, Wagner and Liszt reflect on Wagner's life: the people he has known, the events that occurred and the music he composed.

Robert William Nelson (born March 3, 1959 in Baltimore, Maryland) is a retired American football nose tackle in the National Football League. He played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for one season and the Green Bay Packers for two seasons. Prior to entering the NFL, Nelson had a stint with the Arizona Outlaws of the USFL. Nelson played college football at the University of Miami (Florida).
Nelson gained a bit of fame in the early 1990s through his inclusion in the Nintendo home video game "Tecmo Super Bowl." Somewhat inexplicably, Nelson was among the most dominant defensive players in the game, even though he played as a nose tackle, a position in the which the primary responsibility is to occupy offensive linemen to allow other defensive players to make tackles. Nelson's speed in the game allowed him to make a sack on nearly every play as a human controlled player. As a result, players of Tecmo Super Bowl frequently agree not to use the play.

The Dark Chapter

The Dark Chapter is a studio album by Symphony X guitarist Michael Romeo, released in April 1994 through Zero Corporation (Japan) and reissued in 2000 through InsideOut Music (Europe).
Overview.
Originally recorded in 1992 as a demo tape which Romeo had sent out to various guitar publications, the album that would eventually become "The Dark Chapter" garnered the attention of a Japanese record label named Zero Corporation, who expressed an interest in further material. Romeo subsequently joined up with keyboardist Michael Pinnella to re-record the album for a CD release through Zero in 1994, after which both musicians went on to form Symphony X. An entirely instrumental album, it bears many similarities to the progressive metal stylings showcased by Symphony X, and could be considered a direct precursor to their self-titled debut album which was released later in 1994.
Several of the track titles are references to works by Edgar Allan Poe, such as "The Cask of Amontillado", "The Masque of the Red Death" and "The Premature Burial". Furthermore, the cover art portrays a raven, in reference to Poe's poem "The Raven", and a guitar, with its body resembling the shape of a pendulum, as per Poe's short story "The Pit and the Pendulum". Most of the other track titles bear cryptic meanings: "Sevil Alucard" reads "Dracula Lives" spelled backwards (a possible reference to "Dracula Lives!", a short-lived magazine by Marvel Comics); "MJR #13" is an abbreviation of the initials of Romeo's full name, Michael James Romeo; "Noit Al Ever" reads "revelation" spelled backwards.

Early bird dinner

Early bird dinner is a dinner served earlier than traditional dinner hours; particularly at a restaurant. Many establishments offer a seating prior to their main dinner seating with a reduced price menu, often more limited in selection than the standard dinner menu. Some restaurants offer specific meals or meal options which are sometimes referred to as early bird specials.
The hours which are deemed as "early bird" hours differ, depending on the locale and the establishment. 5:30, 6:00 or 6:30pm are common end times for early bird seatings. Early bird seatings may be as short as an hour or may be several hours long.
Early bird dinners are often stereotypically associated with the elderly and, by association, Florida, but are offered throughout the eastern United States and Canada.

Rebel (Lecrae album)

Rebel is the third studio album by Christian rap artist, Lecrae. The album was released by Reach Records on September 30, 2008. The album was nominated in the best Rap/Hip-Hop Album category at the 40th Annual GMA Dove Awards but lost to Group 1 Crew's "Ordinary Dreamers".
Background.
"Rebel" is titled after Lecrae's encouragement to rebel against modern pop culture, also pointing out that Jesus Christ himself was a rebel. Lecrae has stated that the title of the album is both a noun and a verb. "Rapzilla" called the album "a verbal onslaught against the world's view on life in modern day culture."
Content.
Lecrae tackles some important issues in Rebel. The albums intro and title track, Lecrae speaks out Christians must rebel against the ways of the world. In "Don't Waste Your Life" featuring Dwayne Tryumf, the rapper talks about how worldy pursuits lead to only disappointment in life, and living to serve Jesus leads to happiness. In the song "Identity" featuring J.R. and Da' T.R.U.T.H., Lecrae deals with self-esteem and image issues in the global community, telling listeners that their worth comes from their relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and not in material possessions. "Indwelling Sin" speaks on the battle between his flesh and his spirit in the form of a conversation with his sin. In "Fall Back" featuring Trip Lee, he speaks on guarding against the ideals of the world as portrayed in the media. In "Got Paper" he again attacks the perception that money is the ultimate goal in life and asserts that a relationship with Christ is greater than all of the riches of the world. In "The Bride", Lecrae exhorts listeners to love the church as Christ loves the church.
Reception.
Commercial.
"Rebel" has been a commercial success, having sold over 15,000 copies shortly after its release (9,800 copies in its first week and 5,600 copies in its second week of release, excluding digital downloads) and debuting on eight "Billboard" music charts. The album debuted at #60 on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart and is the first Lecrae album to do so. "Rebel" also debuted at #1 on the Top Gospel Albums chart, outperforming his previous album, "After the Music Stops", which only managed to peak at #5 throughout its 100 week run on the chart. The album remained at the #1 spot on the Top Gospel Albums chart for a second week, and was the first hip hop album to ever reach No. 1 on the chart. "Rebel" debuted at #2 on "Billboard"'s Top Christian Albums and Top Christian & Gospel Albums charts, respectively. The album secured the #10 spot on the Top Independent Albums chart and held the #15 spots equally on the Top Digital Albums and Top Internet Albums charts. "Rebel" also achieved a lower peak position of #61 on the "Billboard" Comprehensive Albums chart.
According to the Nielsen SoundScan, a project specializing in the statistics of album sales, "Rebel" was the highest-selling Christian rap album in the weeks following its release. "Rebel" also maintained a 6-week run on the iTunes Store's Top 10 most sold albums chart.
Awards.
The album was nominated for a Dove Award for Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year at the 40th GMA Dove Awards.

The Age of Wire and String

The Age of Wire and String is Ben Marcus's first book, published in 1995. The book is composed of 8 sections, divided into 41 parts, which combine technical language with lyrical imagery to form a sort of Postmodern catalog by turns surreal, fantastic, and self-referential.
Contents.
The book begins with an "argument", which sets the terms and the tone for the rest of the book:
This book is a catalog of the life project as prosecuted in the Age of Wire and String and beyond, into the arrangements of states, site, and cities and, further, within the small houses that have been granted erection or temporary placement on the perimeters of districts and river colonies. The settlement, in clusters and dispersed, has long required a document of secret motion and instruction – a collection of studies that might serve to clarify the terms obscured within every facet of the living program.
The rest of the book is divided into eight sections - Sleep, God, Food, The House, Animal, Weather, Persons, and The Society - each including five or six short fictions and ending with a glossary of terms. These terms are either invented (e.g. "CLOTH-EATERS" or "GERVIN"), or redefinitions of known words and concepts (e.g. "CARL - Name applied to food built from textiles, sticks, and rags.").

Needful Things (film)

Needful Things is a 1993 horror film, and an adaptation of Stephen King's 1991 novel of the same name. The film was directed by Fraser C. Heston, the son of actor Charlton Heston. It stars Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia and J. T. Walsh.
Plot summary.
A mysterious proprietor named Leland Gaunt, claiming to be from Akron, Ohio, opens a new antiques store called "Needful Things" in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine. The store sells various items of great personal worth to the residents (some of which, like a pendant that eases pain or a toy which predicts the outcome of horse races, are clearly supernatural), and Gaunt demands payment both in cash and in small "favors", usually pranks played by his customers on their neighbors. Gaunt seems to have an innate knowledge of the townspeople and their history, and the pranks exploit their previous rivalries and prejudices, causing them to attack each other. When the normally peaceful townsfolk begin to commit acts of violence and murder, Sheriff Alan Pangborn investigates Gaunt and becomes convinced that his machinations are the source of the unrest. Gaunt is revealed to be the Devil, traveling from place to place, manipulating people into destroying themselves. Acting primarily through a corrupt boat salesman and gambler named Danforth Keeton, Gaunt succeeds in sparking a riot in the town square. 
Pangborn manages to stop the violence before the town destroys itself, and the townspeople admit their pranks, exposing Gaunt's web of manipulation. Keeton, despondent at the death of his wife earlier in the film, blows up Needful Things with Gaunt inside. Defeated, the mysteriously impervious Gaunt emerges completely unharmed from the burning wreckage of his store, predicts he will encounter Pangborn's grandson in 2053, exclaims "Bob will be his name", then departs, presumably to continue his vicious, evil work. He leaves in the same sinister black car (revealed as similarly supernaturally indestructible in the extended cut), in which he arrived at the beginning of the film.

Marika Kotopouli

Marika Kotopouli (; 3 May 1887 – 3 September 1954) was a major Greek actress during the first half of the 20th century.
Biography.
Kotopouli was born on 3 May 1887 in Athens, to Dimitris and Eleni. Her parents were also actors, and Marika's first stage appearance came during one of their tours, in the play "The Coachman of the Alps". She made her official debut in the Royal Theatre in 1903, before going to Paris in 1906 for theatrical studies.
From 1908, she had her own troupe, and theatre, the "Kotopouli Theatre". In this period she developed an intense artistic rivalry with another young actress, Kyveli. The two had very devoted fans, and during the National Schism, their rivalry acquired political overtones also: whilst Kyveli was favoured by the Venizelists, Kotopouli became a symbol of the royalist camp. In 1912 Kotopouli also had a personal love relationship with Ion Dragoumis, who became a major opponent of the Venizelists and was eventually assassinated. Kotopouli and Kyveli collaborated in joint productions from 1932–1934 and again from 1950-1952.
She married Georgios Helmi in 1923. With Spyros Melas and Dimitris Myrat, she co-founded and participated in the "Free Scene" (Ελεύθερη Σκηνή, June 1929 to spring 1930), before embarking on a tour of the United States. In 1933, she played in her only movie, the Greek-Turkish production "Bad Road", based on a novel by Grigorios Xenopoulos. A new theatre, the "Rex", was built specifically for her troupe in Panepistimiou Street in central Athens in 1936. It still stands, as the "Rex/Kotopouli" theatre, and functions as a branch of the National Theatre of Greece. Her repertoire included many classic plays, both ancient Greek and modern ones, ranging from Aeschylus to Goethe and Ibsen.
Her final appearance was in Syros on 24 March 1953. Marika Kotopouli died on 3 September 1954, aged 67.
Honours.
During her lifetime, she was honoured with the Gold Cross of the Order of George I in 1921, and with the Education Ministry's arts and letters prize in 1923.
Kotopouli's old holiday home in the Athens suburb of Zografou was converted into the "Marika Kotopouli Museum", which opened in 1990 and features exhibitions of modern art. In addition, the Marika Kotopouli Award was founded in 1951 to honour Greek actors.

Deer Creek Tunnel

The Deer Creek Tunnel is an incomplete and abandoned double-track railroad tunnel through the Walnut Hills in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Construction was begun in the 1850s by the broad gauge Dayton and Cincinnati Railroad, but ceased in 1855 due to lack of funds, and was never restarted.
The Dayton and Cincinnati Railroad was incorporated in February 1847 as the Dayton, Lebanon and Deerfield Railroad, and renamed Dayton, Springboro, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad in February 1848, Dayton and Cincinnati Railroad in February 1849, and Cincinnati Railway Tunnel Company in January 1872. The Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, a Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiary which itself had the much shorter Oak Street Tunnel in the same area, acquired the unfinished tunnel in September 1902 after a foreclosure sale in May 1896. Ownership passed to the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad in January 1926 and the Connecting Railway in May 1956, and remained with the Penn Central Company when Conrail took over that company's profitable rail assets in 1976.
Deer Creek.
Deer Creek was a stream adjacent to the tunnel project in the valley between Mount Auburn and Eden Park. By 1904, it had been covered by streets and converted into a sewer.

Thomas James (minister)

Thomas James (1804-1891) was a former slave who became an African Methodist Episcopal Zion minister, abolitionist, administrator and author. He was active in New York and Massachusetts with abolitionists, and served with the American Missionary Association and the Union Army during the American Civil War to supervise the contraband camp in Louisville, Kentucky. After the war, he held national offices in the AME Church and was a missionary to black churches in Ohio. While in Massachusetts, he challenged the railroad's custom of forcing blacks into second-class carriages and won a reversal of the rule in the State Supreme Court. He wrote a short memoir published in 1886.
Early life.
Thomas James was born into slavery in Canajoharie, New York in 1804 and named Tom. He was the third child of four of his mother and never knew his father. His family was held by Asa Kimball. A younger sister died when Tom was a child; when he was only eight, he lost his mother, brother and older sister when Kimball sold them away. He never saw his mother or sister again. When Tom was seventeen, Kimball died and all his property, including the young man, was sold to a neighbor named Cromwell Bartlett. Bartlett soon traded Tom to George H. Hess, a wealthy farmer. Soon after that transfer, suffering ill treatment by Hess, Tom decided to escape and become a "freedom seeker".
Freedom.
He left at night and made his way west along the staked path of the future Erie Canal to Lockport. With help, he crossed the Niagara River to Canada and freedom. He stayed about three months until he thought return was safe.
Career and activism.
Initial work and education.
Going to Rochester, Tom found a community of free blacks and more opportunity for work and education. He started working as a laborer. At nineteen Tom attended a church school to learn how to read and write. Gaining literacy opened the door to religion for him, and in 1823 he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Society (AME Zion).
With the opening of the Erie Canal, Tom got a job in the warehouse (where he was called Jim) of the Hudson and Erie line. He boarded with its manager, and also worked around his house. Eventually he was put in charge of the lading of boats and the freight business.
Teaching.
In 1828 Tom started teaching at a school for black children.
Ministry.
The next year started preaching. By 1830 James bought a site and built a small church in Rochester, called the AME Zion Church. When ordained as an African Methodist Episcopal Zion minister in 1833 by AME Zion Bishop Christopher Rush, he took the name Thomas James, his name as a free man.
Assigned to a small black congregation in Syracuse, New York in 1835, James attracted new members and founded the AME Zion Church. He built the congregation from less than 20 to four times that, and helped the congregation purchase a former Methodist church in 1837 for its use. This was the largest African American congregation in the city before the Civil War, and members were active in abolitionism and Underground Railroad activities.
Anti-slavery movement.
Beginning in 1830, James was influenced by the abolitionism of some members of the American Colonization Society (ACS) and writings by Arthur Tappan. He vowed to make the cause his life's work. He began to organize with others in Rochester, including leading white citizens, to hold anti-slavery meetings and form an anti-slavery society in the city. Sometimes they were greeted with violence, but they continued. He was one of two founders of the bi-weekly paper, "The Rights of Man", to promote the cause. James traveled in the county to raise money by subscriptions for the paper. He gradually started speaking at more venues on the cause of abolitionism and attended the first Anti-Slavery Society Conference in Utica.
Next James was assigned to Ithaca, where a small black religious society already existed. During his two years, James helped the congregation build a church. Next he was sent to Sag Harbor, New York, where many free blacks worked in the whaling industry. Last he went to New Bedford, Massachusetts, also a whaling and fishing town. While James led a church, he ordained the future abolitionist Frederick Douglass as a preacher in his congregation, before the beginning of Douglass' major public career.
Freedom Trail.
He contributed to the growing anti-slavery movement in Syracuse and efforts to help escaped slaves on the "Freedom Trail". James was also active with the anti-slavery movement in Massachusetts when he lived there.
James directly helped some slaves gain freedom. For example, while returning to the state by train, he met a young slave girl named Lucy, traveling with her masters from Richmond, Virginia. Talking with her in the segregated car, where they were both required to sit, he invited her to attend his church while they were on vacation in the area. A few weeks passed, but she did not come. James went to her master, who said that his slaves could not receive calls and she could not attend his church. James turned to the law for help, and the local sheriff helped free the girl from her master. Local blacks also helped protect the girl during the events that followed. In the following court case held in Boston, the judge announced that according to the laws of Massachusetts, which prohibited slavery, Lucy was free and had the choice of whether to claim that freedom. She did so, and became free the following day. James also assisted with the "Amistad" case and issues.
Fugistive Slave Act.
While in Boston, James was actively involved in cases dealing with escaped slaves, such as Anthony Burns and Ellen and William Craft. Although the federal Fugitive Slave Act passed in 1850 required states to return slaves to their masters, many Massachusetts citizens strongly opposed the law and helped slaves achieve freedom, even in the face of US Marshals.
Equality.
James also successfully challenged the custom of assigning blacks to second class on railroads and other transportation. When the railroad case was heard on appeal by the State Supreme Court in Boston, "the court decided that the word "color," as applied to persons, was unknown to the laws of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that the youngest colored child had the same rights as the richest white citizen."
Missionary work.
In 1856 James returned to Rochester. After the start of the American Civil War, in 1862 he was assigned to the American Missionary Association to minster to slaves in Tennessee and Louisiana, but was reassigned to Louisville, Kentucky. There he served the occupying Union Army under generals Stephen G. Burbridge and Owen M. Palmer. He helped supervise the contraband camps, liberated slaves who were being held illegally by traders, and monitored d visited the prisons. By orders of Palmer, James performed marriages between the United States Colored Troops (USCT) soldiers and black women who came to the camp, to help the latter achieve their legal freedom as wives of USCT. (At the time the Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to Kentucky and slavery was still a legal institution.)
After the war in 1868, James was elected general superintendent and missionary agent by the General Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Congregation. In 1878 Bishop Wayman appointed James as a missionary preacher for the black churches of Ohio. The continuing unsettled state of southern sympathizers was shown by James' being threatened in Darke County by Regulators, one of the insurgent groups active after the war.
Topeka Relief Association.
In 1880, when the exodus from the South to the West began, James worked with the Topeka Relief Association to help the thousands of black migrants arriving in Kansas, who were known as the Exodusters. A total of 60,000 passed through Topeka. The following year, James worked with others in southern Kansas to organize the Agricultural and Industrial Institute (later merged with Pittsburg State University). Among the other founders was Elizabeth L. Comstock, an English Quaker who also had aided in the relief efforts in Topeka. James became general agent of the school, one of many established in Kansas.
Marriage and family.
James married his first wife in 1829 in Rochester. She was a free black woman and they had four children. His wife died in 1841.
Sixteen years later, in 1857 after going to the South to work, James married again, to a woman who had been a slave in Georgia. She became free after General Sherman's capture of Atlanta. President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freed all slaves in Confederate territory behind Union lines. They had two children together.
Later life.
About 1882 James returned to New York and a parish in Lockport. About 1884, suffering cataracts, James returned with his wife to Rochester. In his later life, he wrote (or dictated) a short memoir, published in 1886. James died in 1891.

Cornwall Church

Cornwall Church (formerly Cornwall Park Church of God) is an Evangelical Christian megachurch in Bellingham, Washington affiliated with the Church of God Movement, with an average weekly attendance exceeding 2,500.
History.
The church that would become Cornwall began around 1900 (shortly after the foundation of the Church of God Movement in 1881) as a home-based church in Bellingham established by Simon Decker, a pioneer and early follower of the movement. In 1920 the church obtained a location on Broadway Street in Bellingham. The church survived the Great Depression solely on donations from rich members, as all tithes (then an average of $3.00) went directly to the pastor's salary. By 1934 the church had a congregation of 40.
In 1946, Charles Ford became pastor. Under his mantra, "It is better to have a hundred people working than to do the work of a hundred," the church's attendance reached 100. Ford obtained four city lots on Meridian Street (adjacent to Cornwall City Park, named after Californian pioneer Pierre Barlow Cornwall) with the hope of one day building an official sanctuary. Ford served till 1967, taking a ten-year sabbatical from 1950–1960.
In 1967, Ford was succeeded by Charles Milliman. Under Milliman's pastorship, the first official church building was constructed on Meridian, and the congregation was given the name "Cornwall Park Church of God". However, attendance did not grow until 1985, when 29-year-old Ken Long succeeded to the pastorship of Cornwall. Under his direction, Cornwall appealed to the collegiate community of Bellingham (from Western Washington University) and began several outreach programs. With attendance averaging at 350, services were moved to the adjacent Boys & Girls Club. When Long left for First Church of God in Vero Beach, Florida in late 1992, his youth pastor Bob Marvel became interim pastor. Soon thereafter, in 1993, Marvel was chosen as senior pastor.
After Marvel's accession, Cornwall experienced rapid growth. In February 2002 Cornwall moved to its current location on Northwest Drive in Bellingham to accommodate its expanding congregation, at which point "Park" and "Church of God" were dropped from its name.
Salt on the Street.
"Salt on the Street" is a weekly evangelistic outreach program founded by Cornwall Church in 2000 that provides food and clothing for the homeless and poor of Whatcom County, Washington. Based on the concept of the "salt of the earth," the program holds weekly outdoor church services and provides aid in overcoming drug and alcohol addictions.
Youth Programs.
Cornwall Church also serves three age groups of kids. Explorers League offers age appropriate learning environments from birth through 5th grade during each weekend service. 6th though 8th grade students have a special gathering called the Edge. It is held on Tuesday nights (6:30-8pm). High school freshmen through seniors have their youth group, Encounter, on Wednesday nights (also 6:30-8pm)

<doc id="19752550" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19752550" title="South Downtown">
South Downtown

South Downtown is a historic neighborhood of Downtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States. South Downtown is primarily home to city, county, state, and federal governmental offices, which prompted the city to adopt signage declaring the area "Government Walk." Although much of South Downtown is dominated by surface parking lots, the neighborhood was passed over during the redevelopment boom of the 1960s and '70s that resulted in the demolition of much of Downtown's architecturally significant buildings. The result are a myriad buildings from the 1950s and earlier that retain their historic structural integrity.
Geography.
South Downtown is located north of I-20, east of Castleberry Hill, south of Five Points, and west of I-85. Underground Atlanta is the primary shopping and entertainment center near South Downtown and it, along with the railroad gulch ("The Gulch"), separates the district from Five Points and the Hotel District. 
History.
South Downtown was once a bustling shopping district. Whitehall Street, renamed Peachtree Street Southwest, was the principal shopping street of Atlanta from the 1850s until the mid-20th century. A source from 1854 reported that the street was "being built up with stores of brick", while Broad Street was the market district.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a cluster of department stores was located in the area. In the 1870s, the "Big Five" were Rich's, Chamberlain, Boyton, & Co., Ryan's; Keeley's; and Dougherty's; later, the J.M. High Company would join their leagues. By the 1930's, Rich's would come to dominate the South Downtown shopping district. In 1949, Whitehall was filled with five and dime stores, such as McCrory's, S. H. Kress, Woolworth's, and W. T. Grant.
As late as 1968 the northern end of Whitehall was still called a "bustling retail corridor". Today, Peachtree Street Southwest continues as a low-end shopping area with several of the older retail buildings converted into "malls": Metro Mall in the old McCrory's building and the Mall at 82 Peachtree, in the Rich's 1906 building. And landmark Miller's Rexall Drugs continues its trade in hoodoo and homeopathic remedies at Broad and Mitchell streets, as it has since 1965.
Located in South Downtown is Hotel Row, both a National Register and locally listed historic district consisting of one block of early 20th century commercial buildings, 3-4 stories high, located on Mitchell Street west of Forsyth Street. The building were originally hotels built to serve the needs of passengers from Terminal Station, opened in 1905 and demolished in 1971. The buildings are the most intact row of early 20th century commercial structures in the city in Atlanta's original business district. The decline of Hotel Row began in the 1920s due to the increased availability of automobile transportation and the construction of the Spring Street viaduct, which made getting to hotels in the northern part of the city easier.
Government facilities.
South Downtown is home to the governmental facilities of the City of Atlanta, Fulton County, and the State of Georgia. South Downtown is also home to federal government offices. This concentration of governmental facilities influenced the city's decision to market the area as "Government Walk." A list of the most well known government buildings in this district are:
To the east of Central Avenue, aside from the Georgia State Capitol, many State of Georgia offices are located in this district, such as the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), Georgia Department of Agriculture, and the Georgia Supreme Court.
Transportation.
MARTA provides public transportation to the district through the Garnett Transit Station, located on Peachtree Street, and Georgia State Station, located on Piedmont Avenue.
Many commuters from the southern suburbs who work in Downtown travel on South Downtown's streets when heading to work. Many streets in this district are one-way, similar to the other districts that make up Downtown.

Inacom

Inacom Corporation (ICO:NYSE) was a large national seller of PC's and services based in Omaha, Nebraska, at one point being the third-largest and most profitable computer distributor in the United States.[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/16/business/compaq-computer-looks-back-and-sees-the-competition-gaining.html?pagewanted=print&src=pm][http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/080700/bus_3722886.html]
Origins.
The company created in 1991 from the merger of ValCom Inc. and Inacomp Computer Centers Inc. ValCom Inc. was founded in 1982 by William L. "Bill" Fairfield.[http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/080700/bus_3722886.html]
In 1997, Inacom entered the Fortune 500 list at position 436 and remained a Fortune 500 company until 2000. Throughout this time, Bill Fairfield served as president and chief executive officer of Inacom.
Acqusition of Vanstar.
On October 9, 1998, Inacom purchased Vanstar for a reported $465 - $480 million. The resulting company employed nearly 12,000 and was estimated to generate $7 billion in revenue. 
The acquisition of Vanstar reportedly added a large amount of debt, and it has been said that Inacom overpaid too much for a company of that size. Vanstar had 43.26 million shares outstanding at the time the deal was struck, and shareholders of Vanstar received .64 shares of ICO for each VST share in a stock swap deal, thus the issuance of 27.7 M shares of stock effectively more than doubled the number of outstanding shares while also being dilutive to the existing shares. This, plus debt concerns, led to a decline in the price of Inacom's stock. 
Furthermore, the acquisition of Vanstar added unrealized credits posted to Inacom's balance sheet, necessitating the requirement to restate financials, and a failure to report financials for 1999 and the first quarter of 2000. As the result of the failure to file the necessary SEC documents, existing credit agreements were terminated and the company had difficulty in arranging new financing. Inacom's failure to file SEC documents also resulted in the New York Stock Exchange delisting Inacom (ICO) since they no longer met listing requirements. [http://www.pecos-softwareworks.com/inacom.shtml]
Bankruptcy.
On January 4, 2000, Inacom sold their distribution business to Compaq for $369.5 million. On January 7, IBM severed their business partner relationship which hurt Inacom badly. On June 16, 2000, only twenty months after the acquisition of Vanstar, Inacom filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and terminated all employees. [http://www.pecos-softwareworks.com/inacom.shtml]
In 2000, Inacom's major assets were sold to Compaq, and Compaq was itself purchased in 2002 by Hewlett-Packard.

United States Senate election in Kansas, 2010

The 2010 United States Senate election in Kansas took place on November 2, 2010 alongside other elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Sam Brownback decided to retire to run for Governor of Kansas, instead of seeking a third term. Republican nominee Jerry Moran won the open seat.
Background.
Sam Brownback was first elected to the Senate in 1996, replacing Bob Dole, who resigned to run for President. Brownback has stated that he would not run for re-election in 2010 because of self-imposed term limits. Kansas is one of the most Republican states in the nation; no Democrat has been elected to either Senate seat since 1932. 
Republican primary.
Campaign.
The retirement of Brownback, a popular U.S. Senator, led to a heavily competitive primary election. Tiahrt, who was on the Committee of Appropriations, had been accused of excessive earmarking while he was in Congress. From 2006-2008, Tiahrt had requested and supported a total of 63 solo earmarks, costing $53.9 million. In the same period, Moran had requested and supported a total of 29 earmarks, with a pricetag of $13.4 million.
General election.
Campaign.
Kansas is a very red state, where no Democrat has won a U.S. Senate election since 1932. After the primary, Moran chose not to release any more negative advertisements. Democrat Lisa Johnston ran a low-profile, quiet race. On election day, she won only one county: Wyandotte County, while Moran won statewide by a landslide.
Debates.
The two never met for a debate.

Paul Powell (politician)

Paul Taylor Powell (January 21, 1902 – October 10, 1970) served as Illinois Secretary of State from 1965 until his death in 1970.
Political career.
A member of the Illinois legislature since the 1930s, Powell served as the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1959 to 1963. In 1959 Powell, Democrat, was elected by a bipartisan coalition of Republicans and downstate Democrats against Joseph De La Cour, the candidate of Richard J. Daley who had majority backing within the Chicago-dominated Democratic caucus. Powell was elected Secretary of State in 1965. The following year, his office was investigated for corruption, but he was exonerated. During his tenure, practice was that any payments made to the Secretary of State's office were made out to simply "Paul Powell". Unsuspecting Illinois residents thought they were writing personal checks for license plate registration. His personal motto was, "There's only one thing worse than a defeated politician, and that's a broke one."
Powell died in 1970, in Rochester, Minnesota, as an outpatient of the Mayo Clinic. Some newspapers, such as the "Pantagraph" of Bloomington, Illinois, wrote disparaging editorials about Powell immediately after his death, and were criticized for it. However, the media criticism of Powell would soon prove to be well-founded.
Although he never made more than $30,000 a year, upon his death, shoeboxes, briefcases and strongboxes with more than $800,000 in cash were found in his hotel suite residence at the St. Nicholas Hotel in Springfield, Illinois. In his hotel room he also had 49 cases of whiskey, 14 transistor radios, and two cases of creamed corn. When settled in 1978 his estate was worth $4.6 million, of which $1 million was racetrack stock. A federal investigation determined that Powell had acquired much of his wealth through illegal cash bribes, which he received for giving noncompetitive state contracts to political associates. The State of Illinois received a $222,999 settlement from his estate; in addition, several state contractors were imprisoned for their roles in the affair.
Powell in pop culture.
Folk singer Steve Goodman wrote a song, "Paul Powell," describing Powell's death and career.

Plague Memorial, Maribor

The Plague Memorial () is a monument in Main Square () of the city of Maribor, Slovenia, erected by "pious burghers" in gratitude for the end of a 1680 plague epidemic that had claimed a third of the city's population.
The original monument was built in 1681; the current one is a 1743 replacement by local sculptor Jožef Štraub. It is considered among his finest work, and one of the best examples of baroque art in Slovenia.
It is made entirely of white marble, and consists of an ornate rectangular pedestal that supports a Corinthian column bearing a gilded statue of the Virgin Mary, crowned with twelve stars and standing on the moon (a reference to Revelation 12:1). At its base, the column is surrounded by six saints to whom the townspeople had prayed for intercession:
The monument was later surrounded by an ornamental stone fence.

United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2010

The 2010 United States Senate election in Connecticut was a midterm election which took place on November 2, 2010 to decide a Class III Senator from the State of Connecticut to join the 112th United States Congress. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd suffered from dropping approval ratings in the past few years due to major controversies, leading him to announce in January 2010 that he would retire, instead of seeking a sixth term. As Dodd was a Democrat, Richard Blumenthal, incumbent State Attorney General, announced on the same day that he would run for Dodd’s seat. The Connecticut Democratic Party nominated Blumenthal on May 21. Businesswoman Linda McMahon won the state party's nominating convention and the August 10 Republican primary to become the Republican candidate.
Dodd's decline in popularity.
Controversies.
Chris Dodd's power and popularity may have deteriorated for at least three reasons since his last re-election:
In December 2008, it was reported that Dodd had a little less than $670,000 banked for a re-election campaign, far less than other senators anticipated to seek re-election. In February 2009, a poll indicated that Dodd's favorability ratings were slipping, and many Connecticut voters were not satisfied with Dodd's explanations regarding the mortgage.
On March 17, 2009, the NRSC released a web ad attacking Dodd for his Irish cottage, his mortgage, and his relocation to Iowa in 2007.
Election troubles.
On March 2, 2009, noted pundit Michael Barone suggested Dodd was "ripe for the picking" in the 2010 election due to the fallout from his various controversies. Nate Silver of the prominent website FiveThirtyEight suggested that if necessary, another Connecticut Democrat should primary Dodd. Silver rated Dodd as the single most vulnerable incumbent senator up for re-election in 2010. On December 10, 2009 the Cook Political Report listed this race as "Lean Republican."
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Susan Bysiewicz was quoted suggesting Dodd's yet unannounced re-election bid could be a drag on the candidacies of other Connecticut Democrats in 2010.
Many political leaders speculated Dodd could be persuaded to retire so as to preserve his "senior statesman" legacy. Fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman had indicated that he would have supported Dodd's reelection, despite past disagreements, including Dodd's 2006 endorsement of Ned Lamont and Lieberman's support of John McCain's 2008 Presidential Campaign.
In fundraising reports issued for the first quarter of 2009, Dodd reported having raised over $1 million, but reported only five contributions from Connecticut residents.
Polling.
A March 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll confirmed Dodd's vulnerability. On April 2, 2009 Quinnipiac released a poll indicating Dodd in serious danger of losing re-election, despite the fact that Connecticut is a heavily blue state that President Obama won in 2008 with over 60% of the vote.
He failed to attain a 50% level of support against three lesser known possible Republican opponents. Former U.S. Congressman Rob Simmons (R) in particular was leading in general election polling with double digit margins, and Simmons reached as high as 51% in a GQR poll. Notably, Rasmussen Reports had Simmons 48% to 35% over Dodd in December 2009, a thirteen point spread.
Democratic nomination.
Campaign.
Merrick Alpert announced his candidacy to challenge current Senator Chris Dodd in May 2009. Facing grave prospects at re-election, Dodd announced his retirement from the Senate on January 6, 2010. Richard Blumenthal, the Attorney General and former State Senator announced he would be running.
Debate.
Merrick Alpert and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal squared-off in a March 1 debate highlighting important issues. On healthcare, Alpert revealed that he supports a single-payer system. Blumenthal explained that pool-purchasing powers should be explored. Alpert presented information as to how insurance rates have skyrocketed in Connecticut since the Attorney General took office. On the topic of war, Blumenthal pledged his support of President Obama's current plan. Alpert expressed that, being a former peacekeeper in Bosnia, he understands what policies work and which ones do not. The current one does not. Alpert set out a plan for the withdrawal of troops from the current war in Afghanistan. On a question concerning relations with Cuba, Blumenthal explained that it would take time, and that he would put together a panel of Cuban-American people to decide the best course of action. Alpert explained that he would vote on the issue that night.
Results.
Blumenthal won the convention overwhelmingly, disallowing any other candidate to get at least 15% of the vote necessary to get on the primary ballot. Therefore, Blumenthal went uncontested within the Democratic Party and officially became the Democratic nominee.
Republican nomination.
Campaign.
On February 27, 2009, "Commentary" magazine reported that various Washington, D.C. Republicans were seeking to get Larry Kudlow, a popular TV talk show host and columnist, to enter the race against Dodd. State Senator Sam Caligiuri originally planned to run the U.S. Senate, but after doing poorly in both primary and general election polling he decided to drop out and instead run the U.S. House of Representatives in the 5th District. Tom Foley has also left the race to instead run for Governor of Connecticut, as incumbent Governor M. Jodi Rell is not seeking re-election.
After the Quinnipiac poll that showed him barely edging Dodd in a potential matchup, Simmons decided to officially enter the race. Upon his announcement, the DSCC attacked Simmons for his past support of George W. Bush and ties to Jack Abramoff and Tom DeLay. A leading state political blogger, who had endorsed Simmons' opponent in 2006, questioned whether these issues were relevant to the 2010 race. Simmons suspended his campaign after he lost the convention, but did not publicly endorse McMahon. In late July, Simmons revived his effort with a TV ad reminding Connecticut Republicans that "I'm still on the ballot."
McMahon, a billionaire, spent slightly more than $21 million through July 2010. Her two primary opponents each spent slightly more than $2.5 million each. When the Republican primary was held on August 10, frontrunner and party-endorsed candidate McMahon defeated Simmons and Schiff to become the official GOP nominee for the fall election against Richard Blumenthal.
Debates.
On March 2, 2010, Republican candidates Linda McMahon, Rob Simmons, and Peter Schiff participated in the first debate of the GOP campaign on Fox 61.
General election.
Debates.
The first debate between Linda McMahon and Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 Senate race occurred on October 4, 2010, moderated by Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier and televised live on Fox Connecticut. In the debate, McMahon identified Blumenthal as a career politician, touted her job creation record while CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, criticized Washington partisanship for Republicans not being invited to the negotiating table during healthcare reform discussions in Congress, and stated that remaining stimulus dollars were a waste that should now be used to pay down debt. Blumenthal as well criticized partisanship, saying that he would have sided with Republicans who voted against the Troubled Assets Relief Program. He also used the debate to argue that middle class tax cuts should not have to wait for current tax rates on top income earners to be extended, stated that he would oppose special interests in Washington, and criticized McMahon for outsourcing WWE products overseas.
The Greater Norwalk Chamber of Commerce, Bridgeport Regional Business Council, and Business Council of Fairfield County sponsored a second debate in Norwalk on October 7. It was aired on News 12 Connecticut.
A third debate between McMahon and Blumenthal was held on October 12, aired on WTNH sister network MyTV9.
Results.
Note: Blumenthal also appeared on the line of the Connecticut Working Families Party and received 30,836 votes on it. His Working Families and Democratic votes have been aggregated together on this table.

LTE (telecommunication)

LTE, an acronym for Long Term Evolution, commonly marketed as 4G LTE, is a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals. It is based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA network technologies, increasing the capacity and speed using a different radio interface together with core network improvements. The standard is developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) and is specified in its Release 8 document series, with minor enhancements described in Release 9.
The world's first publicly available LTE service was launched by TeliaSonera in Stockholm and Oslo on December 14, 2009. LTE is the natural upgrade path for carriers with both GSM/UMTS networks and CDMA2000 networks such as Verizon Wireless, which launched the first large-scale LTE network in North America in 2010, and au by KDDI in Japan have announced they will migrate to LTE. Airtel launched the LTE service in India in April 2012. LTE is, therefore, anticipated to become the first truly global mobile phone standard, although the different LTE frequencies and bands used in different countries will mean that only multi-band phones will be able to use LTE in all countries where it is supported.
Although marketed as a 4G wireless service, LTE (as specified in the 3GPP Release 8 and 9 document series) does not satisfy the technical requirements the 3GPP consortium has adopted for its new standard generation, and which were originally set forth by the ITU-R organization in its IMT-Advanced specification. However, due to marketing pressures and the significant advancements that WIMAX, HSPA+ and LTE bring to the original 3G technologies, ITU later decided that LTE together with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies. The LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the ITU-R requirements to be considered IMT-Advanced. And to differentiate LTE Advanced and WiMAX-Advanced from current 4G technologies, ITU has defined them as "True 4G".
Overview.
LTE is a standard for wireless data communications technology and an evolution of the GSM/UMTS standards. The goal of LTE was to increase the capacity and speed of wireless data networks using new DSP (digital signal processing) techniques and modulations that were developed around the turn of the millennium. A further goal was the redesign and simplification of the network architecture to an IP-based system with significantly reduced transfer latency compared to the 3G architecture. The LTE wireless interface is incompatible with 2G and 3G networks, so that it must be operated on a separate wireless spectrum.
LTE was first proposed by NTT DoCoMo of Japan in 2004, and studies on the new standard officially commenced in 2005. In May 2007, the LTE/SAE Trial Initiative (LSTI) alliance was founded as a global collaboration between vendors and operators with the goal of verifying and promoting the new standard in order to ensure the global introduction of the technology as quickly as possible. The LTE standard was finalized in December 2008, and the first publicly available LTE service was launched by TeliaSonera in Oslo and Stockholm on December 14, 2009 as a data connection with a USB modem. The LTE services were launched by major North American carriers as well, with the Samsung SCH-r900 being the world’s first LTE Mobile phone starting on September 21, 2010 and Samsung Galaxy Indulge being the world’s first LTE smartphone starting on February 10, 2011 both offered by MetroPCS and HTC ThunderBolt offered by Verizon starting on March 17 being the second LTE smartphone to be sold commercially. In Canada, Rogers Wireless was the first to launch LTE network on July 7, 2011 offering the Sierra Wireless AirCard® 313U USB mobile broadband modem, known as the "LTE Rocket™ stick" then followed closely by mobile devices from both HTC and Samsung. Initially, CDMA operators planned to upgrade to rival standards called UMB and WiMAX, but all the major CDMA operators (such as Verizon, Sprint and MetroPCS in the United States, Bell and Telus in Canada, au by KDDI in Japan, SK Telecom in South Korea and China Telecom/China Unicom in China) have announced that they intend to migrate to LTE after all. The evolution of LTE is LTE Advanced, which was standardized in March 2011. Services are expected to commence in 2013.
The LTE specification provides downlink peak rates of 300 Mbit/s, uplink peak rates of 75 Mbit/s and QoS provisions permitting a transfer latency of less than 5 ms in the radio access network. LTE has the ability to manage fast-moving mobiles and supports multi-cast and broadcast streams. LTE supports scalable carrier bandwidths, from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz and supports both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time-division duplexing (TDD). The IP-based network architecture, called the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and designed to replace the GPRS Core Network, supports seamless handovers for both voice and data to cell towers with older network technology such as GSM, UMTS and CDMA2000. The simpler architecture results in lower operating costs (for example, each E-UTRA cell will support up to four times the data and voice capacity supported by HSPA).
Features.
Much of the LTE standard addresses the upgrading of 3G UMTS to what will eventually be 4G mobile communications technology. A large amount of the work is aimed at simplifying the architecture of the system, as it transits from the existing UMTS circuit + packet switching combined network, to an all-IP flat architecture system. E-UTRA is the air interface of LTE. Its main features are:
Voice calls.
The LTE standard supports only packet switching with its all-IP network. Voice calls in GSM, UMTS and CDMA2000 are circuit switched, so with the adoption of LTE, carriers will have to re-engineer their voice call network. Three different approaches sprang up:
One additional approach which is not initiated by operators is the usage of over-the-top content services, using applications like Skype and Google Talk to provide LTE voice service. However, now and in the foreseeable future, the voice call service is, and will still be, the main revenue source for the mobile operators. So handing the LTE voice service over completely to the OTT actors is thus something which is not expected to receive much support in the telecom industry.
Most major backers of LTE preferred and promoted VoLTE from the beginning. The lack of software support in initial LTE devices as well as core network devices however led to a number of carriers promoting VoLGA (Voice over LTE Generic Access) as an interim solution. The idea was to use the same principles as GAN (Generic Access Network, also known as UMA or Unlicensed Mobile Access), which defines the protocols through which a mobile handset can perform voice calls over a customer's private Internet connection, usually over wireless LAN. VoLGA however never gained much support, because VoLTE (IMS) promises much more flexible services, albeit at the cost of having to upgrade the entire voice call infrastructure. VoLTE will also require Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) in order to be able to smoothly perform a handover to a 3G network in case of poor LTE signal quality.
While the industry has seemingly standardized on VoLTE for the future, the demand for voice calls today has led LTE carriers to introduce CSFB as a stopgap measure. When placing or receiving a voice call, LTE handsets will fall back to old 2G or 3G networks for the duration of the call.
Enhanced voice quality.
To ensure compatibility, 3GPP demands at least AMR-NB codec (narrow band), but the recommended speech codec for VoLTE is Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband, also known as HD Voice. This codec is mandated in 3GPP networks that support 16 kHz sampling.
Fraunhofer IIS has proposed and demonstrated "Full-HD Voice", an implementation of the AAC-ELD (Advanced Audio CodingEnhanced Low Delay) codec for LTE handsets. Where previous cell phone voice codecs only supported frequencies up to 3.5 kHz and upcoming wideband audio services branded as "HD Voice" up to 7 kHz, Full-HD Voice supports the entire bandwidth range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. For end-to-end Full-HD Voice calls to succeed however, both the caller and recipient's handsets as well as networks have to support the feature.
Frequency bands.
The LTE standard covers a range of many different bands, each of which is designated by both a frequency and a band number. In North America, 700, 850, 1900, 1700/2100 (AWS) and 2600 MHz (Rogers Communications, Bell Canada) are used (bands 4, 7, 12, 13, 17, 25, 26, 41); 2500 MHz in South America; 800, 900, 1800, 2600 MHz in Europe(bands 3, 7, 20); 1800 and 2600 MHz in Asia (bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 40); and 1800 MHz in Australia and New Zealand (bands 3, 40). As a result, phones from one country may not work in other countries. Users will need a multi-band capable phone for roaming internationally.
Patents.
According to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute's (ETSI) intellectual property rights (IPR) database, about 50 companies have declared, as of March 2012, holding essential patents covering the LTE standard. The ETSI has made no investigation on the correctness of the declarations however, so that "any analysis of essential LTE patents should take into account more than ETSI declarations."

Ashok Kumar (film)

Ashok Kumar was a 1941 Tamil-language film directed by Raja Chandrasekhar. It starred M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, Chittor V. Nagaiah, P. Kannamba, N. S. Krishnan, T. A. Madhuram, M. G. Ramachandran and Ranjan.
Plot.
The film is based on an age-old Buddhist folktale connected with Mauryan Emperor Ashoka's son Kunal. The Mauryan prince Kunal was courted by Ashoka's younger queen Tishyarakshita and when he rejected her advances, was falsely accused by the queen of trying to seduce her and was thrown into prison and blinded. The story, however, comes to a happy end with his eyesight being restored by Lord Buddha and the king acquits of all the charges.
Production.
Almost all of MKT's movies were great successes. And Ashok Kumar was no exception. Ashok Kumar premiered in 1941 and was a roaring success. A Tollywood actress Pasupuleti Kannamba played the role of Queen Tishyarakshita. Ashok Kumar was her second Tamil film and she did not know the language. She was provided with a script in which Tamil words have been transliterated into Telugu. However, despite these issues, Kannamba did a commendable job with her dialogue delivery.
Ashok Kumar was one of the first films for film actor and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran. He played the role of Mahendran in the movie. Ashok Kumar also marked the debut of Ranjan who later starred in hit movies as "Mangamma Sabatham" and "Chandralekha". The background music was provided by G. Ramanathan-Elangovan combine which later produced hits as "Sivakavi" and "Haridas".
One of the highlights of the film was a song and dance sequence, "Unnai kandu mayangaatha" in which Kannamba dances to M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar's singing. The song was shot in a single night at Newtone Studio.

United States Senate election in Arkansas, 2010

The 2010 United States Senate election in Arkansas took place on November 2, 2010 alongside other elections to the United States Senate in other states, as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln ran for re-election to a third term, but lost to Republican nominee John Boozman. Boozman became the first Republican in 138 years to win this seat.
Democratic primary.
The Democratic primary was held on May 18, 2010, with early voting from May 3–17. As no candidate received 50 percent of the vote, a runoff election was held on June 8, with early voting from June 1–7.
Republican primary.
The Republican primary was held on May 18, 2010, with early voting from May 3–17.
Candidates.
In December 2009, a straw poll was held for the current Republican candidates for U.S. Senate. The results were as follows:
General election.
Campaign.
Arkansas had previously only elected one Republican senator since the Reconstruction, who was defeated after his first term in 2002 by Mark Pryor. Lincoln faced Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter and narrowly won the primary contest. 
MoveOn.org supported Halter, criticizing Lincoln for her stance on issues such as health care and environmental regulations. Labor unions also backed Halter, and pledged to spend more than $3 million on his campaign. The political blog FiveThirtyEight ranked Lincoln the most vulnerable senator of this electoral cycle. RealClearPolitics claimed that in 2010 Lincoln had the potential for the lowest percentage of the vote for any incumbent since the nation first began directly electing senators. Boozman received 58% of the vote in the general election and defeated Lincoln (37%), Libertarian Trevor Downs (3%) and Green John Gray (2%).
Lincoln heavily criticized Boozman of supporting the FairTax and privatization of Social Security. She released an advertisement touting her support for earmarks.
Debates.
Lincoln and Boozman agreed to two debates.

Turkey red

Turkey red is a color that was widely used to dye cotton in the 18th and 19th century. It was made using the root of the rubia plant, through a long and laborious process. It originated in India or Turkey, and was brought to Europe in the 1740s. In France it was known as "rouge d'Andrinople".
History.
As the Industrial Revolution spread across Europe, chemists and manufacturers sought new red dyes that could be used for large-scale manufacture of textiles. One popular color imported into Europe from Turkey and India in the 18th and early 19th century was Turkey red, known in France as "rouge d'Andrinople". Beginning in the 1740s, this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in England, the Netherlands and France. Turkey red used the root of the rubia plant as the colorant, but the process was long and complicated, involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye, olive oil, sheep's dung, and other ingredients. The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red, similar to carmine, perfectly suited to cotton. The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa, the Middle East and America. In 19th century America, it was widely used in making the traditional patchwork quilt.
The Process.
The process of dyeing cotton turkey red, as it was practiced in Turkey in the 18th century, was described in a text by a Manchester dyer in 1786:

United States House of Representatives elections, 2010

The 2010 United States House of Representatives elections, were held on November 2, 2010, as part of the 2010 midterm elections (along with Senate elections), at the midpoint of President Barack Obama's first term in office. Voters of the 50 U.S. states chose 435 U.S. Representatives. Voters of the U.S. territories, commonwealths, and the District of Columbia chose their non-voting delegates.
Republicans regained control of the chamber they had lost in the 2006 midterm elections, picking up a net total of 63 seats and erasing the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. Although the sitting U.S. President's party usually loses seats in a midterm election, the 2010 election resulted in the highest loss of a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and this also happened to be the Republicans largest gain in House seats since 1938. Republicans gained the most in New York state where they picked up six seats, defeating five incumbents and winning an open Democratic district. The heavy Democratic Party losses were attributed to anger with President Obama, opposition to the Affordable Care Act, large budget deficits, and the weak economy. This was the third consecutive mid-term election in a president's first term where the Republican Party has made gains in the House of Representatives.
Background.
Following the 2006 elections, Democrats took control of the House as well as the Senate. In the 2008 elections, which coincided with Democrat Barack Obama's victory over Republican John McCain for the presidency, Democrats increased their majorities in both chambers. Of the 435 congressional districts, 242 were carried by Obama, while 193 voted for McCain. Of the districts Obama won, 34 elected a Republican to the House, while 49 of the districts McCain won elected a Democrat.
Republican gains.
The Republicans' 63-seat pickup in the House to take control of that chamber, as well as their six Senate seats gained, signified a dramatic rollback of recent Democratic gains. In the election, Republicans won their greatest number of House seats since 1946. This has been attributed to the continued economic recession, as well as President Obama's controversial stimulus and health care reform bills. Republicans also took control of 29 of the 50 state governorships, and gained 690 seats in state legislatures to hold their greatest number since the 1928 elections. In North Carolina, Republicans won control of both chambers of the state legislature for the first time in 140 years. The Great Lakes region, which had recently favored the Democratic Party, went strongly Republican. In California and the Pacific Northwest, however, the Democrats retained the upper hand.

Lawaan II, Negros Occidental

Barangay Lawaan II is bounded by Barangay Lawaan III on the North, Barangay San Isidro on the East, Barangay Mohon on the South, and Barangay Lawaan I on the West. It has a land area of 72.251 hectares with fourteen (14) sitios. The barangay belongs to the middle-income class of the City of Talisay.
History.
This barangay was founded in 1969 and its name was taken from the tall and beautiful endemic Lawaan trees that were plentiful. It was said that when our forefathers came to Cebu, this place was full of vegetation and its lush forest extended up to the area of Manipis. The red and white Lawaan species were in abundance.
Part of Lawaan was a place called Bacayan, which was near the Mananga River. In fact, the Mananga Bridge in Tabunoc used to be called “Taytayan sa Bacayan”. It is also the home of various subdivision of the city.

1980s in music

"For music from a year in the 1980s, go to 80 | 81 | 82 | 83 | 84 | 85 | 86 | 87 | 88 | 89
"For a history of music in all times, see Timeline of musical events."
This article includes an overview of the major events and trends in popular music in the 1980s.
The 1980s saw the emergence of pop, dance music and New Wave. As the term disco fell out of fashion in the decade's early years, genres such as post-disco, Italo disco, Euro disco and dance-pop became more popular. Rock music continued to enjoy a wide audience. Sub-genres such as New Wave, soft rock, and glam metal and shred guitar characterized by heavy distortion, pinch harmonics and whammy bar abuse became very popular. Adult contemporary, quiet storm, and smooth jazz gained popularity.
The 1980s are commonly using digital recording, associated with the usage of synthesizers, with synthpop music and other electronic genres featuring non-traditional instruments increasing in popularity. Also during this decade, several major electronic genres were developed, including electro, techno, house, freestyle and Eurodance, rising in prominence during the 1990s and beyond. Throughout the decade, R&B, hip hop and urban genres were becoming commonplace, particularly in the inner-city areas of large, metropolitan cities; rap was especially successful in the latter part of the decade, with the advent of the golden age of hip hop. These urban genres—particularly rap and hip hop—would continue their rise in popularity through the 1990s and 2000s.
A 2010 survey conducted by the digital broadcaster Music Choice, which polled over 11,000 participants, revealed that the 1980s is the most favored music decade of the last 50 years.
North America.
Pop.
The 1980s saw the reinvention of Michael Jackson, the superstardom of Prince and the emergence of Madonna, Whitney Houston, & Janet Jackson—who were all the most successful musicians during this time. Their videos became a permanent fixture on MTV and gained a worldwide mass audience. Michael Jackson was the first African American artist to have his music video aired on MTV. Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album from 1982 is the best-selling album of all time; it is cited as selling as many as 110 million copies worldwide. Being the biggest selling artist of that decade, he was the biggest star of the 1980s. Madonna was the most successful female artist of the decade. Her third studio album, "True Blue", became the best-selling female album of the 1980s. Other Madonna albums from the decade include "Like a Virgin" which became one of the best selling albums of all-time and "Like a Prayer" which was called "as close to art as pop music gets" by "Rolling Stone". Madonna made music videos a marketing tool and was among the first to make them an art form. Many of her songs topped the Charts around the world, such as: "Like a Virgin", "Papa Don't Preach", "La Isla Bonita" and "Like a Prayer". After the "Like a Prayer" album in 1989, Madonna was named artist of the decade by a number of magazines and awards including Billboard & MTV. Whitney Houston arguably became one of the best selling artist of 1980's.Her emergence became the footprints of different singers because of her vocal gymnastics. She's the second best selling female artist of the 80's next to Madonna.Whitney Houston debut album became the best selling debut album of all time and her sophomore album became the first female debut at no. 1 in the history of Billboard 200 and she is the first and the only artist charted seven consecutive song in the Billboard 100 in 1980's.
By 1980, the disco production of the 1970s, largely dependent on orchestras, is replaced by a lighter synthpop production, which is replaced by dance music. In the second half of the 1980s, teen pop has its first wave. Bands and artists include Exposé, New Kids on the Block, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Tommy Page, New Edition, Stacey Q, The Bangles, Madonna, George Michael, Olivia Newton-John and others.
Prominent American urban pop acts of the 1980s include Tina Turner, Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston and Deniece Williams. African American artists like Lionel Richie and Prince went on to become some of the decade's biggest pop stars, ruling MTV, with Prince becoming arguably the second biggest male superstar after Michael Jackson. Their commercial albums included 1999, "Purple Rain", and "Sign "O" the Times" by Prince and "Lionel Richie", "Can't Slow Down" and "Dancing on the Ceiling" by Richie.
During the mid-1980s American pop singer Cyndi Lauper was considered the "Voice of the MTV Generation of 80s" and so different visual style that made the world for teens. With "She's So Unusual" and "True Colors" their first two albums were a critical and sales success, which released the classics hits of the 80s, "Girls Just Want to Have Fun", "Time After Time", "She Bop", "All Through the Night", "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough", "True Colors" and "Change of Heart".
American artists such as Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner, Bon Jovi, Cher, Hall & Oates, Prince and Janet Jackson ruled the charts throughout the decade and achieved tremendous success worldwide. Their fame and commercial success lasts up to date although Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson are deceased.
Rock.
Hard rock and heavy / glam metal.
Beginning in 1983 and peaking in success in 1986-1991, the decade saw the resurgence of hard rock music and the emergence of its glam metal subgenre. Bands such as Queen, Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, Quiet Riot, Europe, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Poison, Whitesnake, and Cinderella were among the most popular acts of the decade. The 1980s saw the emergence of wildly popular hard rock band Guns N' Roses and the successful comebacks of Aerosmith and Alice Cooper in the late 1980s. The success of hard rock act Van Halen spanned throughout the entire decade, first with singer David Lee Roth and later with Sammy Hagar. Queen, which had expanded its music to experimental and crossover genres in the early 1980s, returned to guitar-driven hard rock with "The Miracle" in 1989. Additionally, a few women managed to achieve stardom in the 1980s' hard rock scene: Pat Benatar, who had been around since the late 1970s, is a prime example of female success in hard rock, and so are both ex-Runaways Joan Jett and Lita Ford.
The Arena rock trend of the 1970s continued in the 1980s with bands like Styx, Rush, Journey, Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, ZZ Top, and Aerosmith which were popular into the early 1980s, with glam metal taking their place later.
Traditionally associated (and often confused) with hard rock, heavy metal was also extremely popular throughout the decade, with Ozzy Osbourne achieving success during his solo career; bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Dio were also widely popular British acts. Speed metal pioneer Motörhead maintained its popularity through the releases of several albums.
Underground scenes produced an array of more extreme, aggressive Metal subgenres: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth, while other styles like death metal and black metal remaining subcultural phenomena.
The decade also saw the emergence of a string of guitar virtuosi, influenced by guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen; Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen achieved international recognition for their skills. While considerably less numerous, bass guitar virtuosi also gained momentum in the 1980s: Billy Sheehan (of David Lee Roth and Mr. Big fame), Cliff Burton (of Metallica) and alternative/funk metal bassist Les Claypool (of Primus fame) became famous during that period. Iron Maiden founder and bassist Steve Harris has also been praised numerous times for his galloping style of bass playing.
Both Hard rock and Heavy metal were extremely popular live genres and bands toured extensively around the globe.
Alternative rock.
By 1984, a majority of groups signed to independent record labels were mining from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper rational post-punk years.
Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock was mainly an underground phenomena. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like "Rolling Stone", alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily relegated to independent record labels, fanzines and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country. Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success.
Early American alternative bands such as R.E.M., The Hits, The Feelies, and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with folk music and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, "Murmur" (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers.
American indie record labels SST Records, Twin/Tone Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord Records presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. Minnesota bands Hüsker Dü and The Replacements were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.
By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop (They Might Be Giants and Camper Van Beethoven), to noise rock (Sonic Youth, Big Black) to industrial rock (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails) and to early Grunge (Mudhoney, Nirvana). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of Boston's the Pixies and Los Angeles' Jane's Addiction.
American Alternative Rock bands of 1980s included Hüsker Dü, The Replacements, R.E.M., The Pixies, and Sonic Youth which were popular long before the Grunge movement of the early 1990s.
Soft rock and singer-songwriter.
By the late 1970s and early 1980s the original wave of singer-songwriters had largely been absorbed into a more general pop or soft rock format, but some new artists in the singer-songwriter tradition (including Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Mark Heard, Lucinda Williams, Patti Smith, Kate Bush, Rickie Lee Jones, Stevie Nicks, Cheryl Wheeler and Warren Zevon) continued to emerge, and in other cases rock and even punk rock artists such as Peter Case, Paul Collins and Paul Westerberg transitioned to careers as solo singer-songwriters.
In the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with Suzanne Vega whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of Tracy Chapman, Nanci Griffith, k.d. lang and Tori Amos, who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market.
Other trends.
Various older rock bands made a comeback. Bands originating from the early to mid-1960s such as The Beach Boys and The Kinks had hits with "Kokomo", "Come Dancing" and "Do It Again". Bands with popularity in the mid-1970s such as the Steve Miller Band and Steely Dan also had hits with "Abracadabra" and "Hey Nineteen". Singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen released his blockbuster album "Born In The USA", which produced a record-tying 7 hit singles. Stevie Ray Vaughan and George Thorogood sparked a revival of Electric blues and Blues rock. Massively successful hard rock band Led Zeppelin disbanded after drummer John Bonham's 1980 death, while contemporaries AC/DC continued to have success after the death of former frontman Bon Scott. Country rock saw a decline after Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1977 plane crash and the 1980 disbanding of the genre's most successful band, the Eagles. The Grateful Dead had their biggest hit in band history with "Touch of Grey". The Who managed to provide the hit songs "You Better You Bet" and "Eminence Front" before burning out after the death of drummer Keith Moon.
Hardcore punk flourished throughout the early to mid-1980s, with bands leading the genre such as Black Flag, Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Suicidal Tendencies, amongst others. It began to wane, however, in the latter half of the decade, with the New York hardcore scene dominating the genre.
Contemporary R&B.
Contemporary R&B originated in the 1980s, when musicians started adding disco-like beats, high-tech production, and elements of hip hop, soul and funk to rhythm and blues, making it more danceable and modern. The top mainstream R&B artists of 1980s included Michael Jackson, Prince, Jermaine Jackson, The Whispers, The S.O.S. Band, Stevie Wonder, Kool & the Gang, Yarbrough and Peoples, Smokey Robinson, Rick James, Diana Ross, Lionel Richie, Earth, Wind & Fire, Dazz Band, Evelyn King, Marvin Gaye, Mtume, DeBarge, Midnight Star, and Freddie Jackson.
In the mid-1980s, many of the recordings by artists Luther Vandross, Freddie Jackson, Sade, Anita Baker, Teddy Pendergrass, Peabo Bryson and others became known as "quiet storm". The term had originated with Smokey Robinson's 1975 album "A Quiet Storm". Quiet storm has been described as "R&B's answer to soft rock and adult contemporary—while it was primarily intended for black audiences, quiet storm had the same understated dynamics, relaxed tempos and rhythms, and romantic sentiment."
Tina Turner made a comeback during the second half of the 1980s, while Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson broke into the pop music charts with a series of hits. Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson's third studio album "Control" (1986) was "important to the development of R&B for a number of reasons", as she and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility." Ripani wrote that "the success of "Control" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development." That same year, Teddy Riley began producing R&B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed "new jack swing", and was applied to artists such as Bobby Brown, Keith Sweat, MC Hammer, Boyz ll Men, Guy, Jodeci, and Bell Biv DeVoe.
Michael Jackson remained a prominent figure in the genre in the late 1980s, following the release of his album "Bad" (1987) which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. Janet Jackson's 1989 album "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814" continued the development of contemporary R&B into the 1990s, as the album's title track "Rhythm Nation" made "use of elements from across the R&B spectrum, including use of a sample loop, triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes." The release of "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814" became the only album in history to produce number one hits on the Billboard Charts Hot 100 in three separate calendar years—"Miss You Much" in 1989, "Escapade" and "Black Cat" in 1990, and "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" in 1991—and the only album in the history of the Hot 100 to have seven top 5 hit singles.
Hip hop.
Encompassing graffiti art, break dancing, rap music, and fashion, hip-hop became the dominant cultural movement of the African American and Hispanic communities in the 1980s. The Hip hop musical genre had a strong influence on pop music in the late 1980s which still continues to the present day.
During the 1980s, the hip hop genre started embracing the creation of rhythm by using the human body, via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing. Pioneers such as Doug E. Fresh, Biz Markie and Buffy from the Fat Boys made beats, rhythm, and musical sounds using their mouth, lips, tongue, voice, and other body parts. "Human Beatbox" artists would also sing or imitate turntablism scratching or other instrument sounds.
The 1980s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop. In 1982, Melle Mel and Duke Bootee recorded "The Message" (officially credited to Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five), a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of Run-DMC's "It's like That" and Public Enemy's "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos".
Popular hip hop artists of the 1980s include Run D.M.C., Beastie Boys, NWA, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Eric B. & Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Boogie Down Productions, and Ice-T, among others.
Electronic music.
In the 1980s, dance music records made using only electronic instruments became increasingly popular, largely influenced from the Electronic music of Kraftwerk and 1970s disco music. Such music was originally born of and popularized via regional nightclub scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in discothèques as well as the rave scene.
House music is a style of electronic dance music which originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA in the early 1980s. House music was strongly influenced by elements of soul- and funk-infused varieties of disco. Club play from pioneering DJs like Ron Hardy and Lil Louis, local dance music record shops, and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago and among visiting DJs & producers from Detroit. Trax Records and DJ International Records, local labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music outside of Chicago. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop & dance music worldwide during the 1990s.
It has been widely cited that the initial blueprint for Techno was developed during the mid-1980s in Detroit, Michigan, by Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May (the so-called "Belleville Three"), and Eddie Fowlkes, all of whom attended school together at Belleville High, near Detroit. Though initially conceived as party music that was played on daily mixed radio programs and played at parties given by cliquish, Detroit high school clubs, it has grown to be a global phenomenon.
Country music.
As the 1980s dawned, pop-influenced country music was the dominant style, through such acts as Kenny Rogers, Ronnie Milsap, T.G. Sheppard, Eddie Rabbitt, Crystal Gayle, Anne Murray and Dolly Parton. The 1980 movie "Urban Cowboy", a romantic comedy starring John Travolta and Debra Winger, spawned a successful soundtrack album featuring pop-styled country songs, including "Lookin' for Love" by Johnny Lee, "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" by the Charlie Daniels Band, "Could I Have This Dance" by Murray and "Love the World Away" by Rogers. The songs, and the movie itself, resulted in an early 1980s boom in pop-styled country music, and the era is sometimes known as the "Urban Cowboy Movement".
By the mid-1980s, country music audiences were beginning to tire of country pop. Although some pop-country artists continued to record and release successful songs and albums, the genre in general was beginning to suffer. By 1985, a "New York Times" article declared country music "dead". However, by this time, several newcomers were working behind the scenes to reverse this perception.
The year 1986 brought forth several new artists who performed in traditional country styles, such as honky-tonk. This sparked the "new traditionalist" movement, or return to traditional country music. The most successful of these artists included Randy Travis, Dwight Yoakam, Ricky Van Shelton and Holly Dunn. Also, artists like Kathy Mattea and Keith Whitley, both of whom had been performing for a few years prior, had their first major hits during 1986; Mattea was more folk-styled, while Whitley was pure honky-tonk. But the new traditionalist movement had already taken hold as early as 1981, when newcomers such as Ricky Skaggs and George Strait had their first big hits, and Reba McEntire had her first big hit in 1980; in addition, songwriter–guitarist and Chet Atkins prodigy Steve Wariner also emerged as a popular act starting in the early 1980s. Another boom period for newcomers with new traditionalist styles was 1989, when artists such as Clint Black, Garth Brooks, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Lorrie Morgan and Travis Tritt had their first big hits.
Vocal duos were also popular because of their harmonies, most notably The Bellamy Brothers and The Judds. Several of the Bellamy Brothers' songs included double-entendre' laden hooks, on songs such as "Do You Love as Good As You Look". The Judds, a mother-and-daughter duo, combined elements of contemporary pop and traditional country music on songs such as "Why Not Me" and "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)".
Country music groups and bands continued to rise in popularity during the 1980s. The most successful of the lot was Alabama, a Fort Payne-based band that blended traditional and pop country sounds with southern rock. Their concerts regularly sold out, while their single releases regularly reached No. 1 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart. In 1989, Alabama was named the Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music. By the end of the 1980s, the group had sold more than 24 million albums in the United States.
Ranking just behind Alabama in popularity, as far as groups were concerned, were The Oak Ridge Boys and The Statler Brothers, both four-part harmony groups with gospel and country-pop stylings. The popularity of those three groups sparked a boom in new groups and bands, and by the end of the 1980s, fans were listening to such acts as Restless Heart and Exile, the latter which previously enjoyed success with the pop hit "Kiss You All Over".
Despite the prevailing pop country sound, enduring acts from the 1970s and earlier continued to enjoy great success with fans. George Jones, one of the longest-running acts of the time, recorded several successful singles, including the critically acclaimed "He Stopped Loving Her Today". Conway Twitty continued to have a series of No. 1 hits, with 1986's "Desperado Love" becoming his 40th chart-topper on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart, a record that stood for nearly 20 years. The movie "Coal Miner's Daughter" profiled the life of Loretta Lynn (with Sissy Spacek in the lead role), while Willie Nelson also had a series of acting credits. Dolly Parton had much success in the 1980s, with several leading movie roles, two No. 1 albums and 13 number one hits, and having many successful tours. Others who had been around for a while and continued to have great success were Eddy Arnold, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Ray Price, Hank Williams Jr. and Tammy Wynette.
The UK and the rest of Europe.
Rock.
Post punk.
Some of the most successful post-punk bands in the 1970s, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Psychedelic Furs, also continued their success during the 1980s. Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as Love and Rockets and New Order respectively.
The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including The Smiths, The Cure, The Fall, The Pop Group, The Mekons, Echo and the Bunnymen and Teardrop Explodes, tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes.
The Police had their first hit song with "Roxanne", written by Sting, reaching number 12 in the UK Charts. Ireland's U2 incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world.
Although many post-punk bands continued to record and perform, it declined as a movement in the mid-1980s as acts disbanded or moved off to explore other musical areas, but it has continued to influence the development of rock music and has been seen as a major element in the creation of the alternative rock movement.
New Wave music.
The arrival of MTV in 1981 would usher in New Wave's most successful era. British artists, unlike many of their American counterparts, had learned how to use the music video early on. Several British acts signed to independent labels were able to outmarket and outsell American artists that were signed with major labels. Journalists labelled this phenomenon a "Second British Invasion".
In the fall of 1982, "I Ran (So Far Away)" by A Flock of Seagulls entered the Billboard Top Ten, arguably the first successful song that owed almost everything to video. They would be followed by bands like Duran Duran whose glossy videos would come to symbolize the power of MTV. Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing" gently poked fun at MTV which had helped make them international rock stars. In 1983, 30% of the record sales were from British acts. 18 of the top 40 and 6 of the top 10 singles on July 18 were by British artists. Overall record sales would rise by 10% from 1982. Newsweek magazine featured Annie Lennox and Boy George on the cover of one of its issues while "Rolling Stone Magazine" would release an "England Swings" issue. In April 1984 40 of the top 100 singles were from British acts while 8 of the top 10 singles in a May 1985 survey were of British origin. Veteran music journalist Simon Reynolds theorized that similar to the first British Invasion the use of black American influences by the British acts helped to spur success. Commentators in the mainstream media credited MTV and the British acts with bringing colour and energy to back to pop music while rock journalists were generally hostile to the phenomenon because they felt it represented image over content. MTV continued its heavy rotation of videos by New Wave-oriented acts until 1987, when it changed to a heavy metal and rock dominated format.
New Romantics.
New Romanticism emerged as part of the New Wave music movement in London's nightclub including Billy's and The Blitz Club towards the end of the 1970s. Influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music, it developed glam rock fashions, gaining its name from the frilly fop shirts of early Romanticism. New Romantic music often made extensive use of synthesisers. Pioneers included Visage and Ultravox and among the commercially most successful acts associated with the movement were Adam and the Ants, Culture Club, Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran. By about 1983 the original movement had dissolved, with surviving acts dropping most of the fashion elements to pursue mainstream careers.
Post Modern.
Post Modern music developed out of the post punk scene in the later 1970s, now commonly referred to as Gothic Rock, or Goth rock in short. It combines dark, often keyboard-heavy music with introspective and depressing lyrics. Notable early gothic rock bands include Bauhaus (whose "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is often cited as the first goth record), Siouxsie and the Banshees (who may have coined the term), The Cure, The Sisters of Mercy, and Fields of the Nephilim. Gothic rock gave rise to a broader goth subculture that included clubs, various fashion trends and numerous publications that grew in popularity in the 1980s, gaining notoriety by being associated by several moral panics over suicide and Satanism.
Heavy metal.
In the, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal broke into the mainstream, as albums by Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon and Motörhead, reached the British top 10. In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with "No Sleep 'til Hammersmith". After a string of UK top 10 albums, Whitesnake's 1987 self-titled album was their most commercially successful, with hits, "Here I Go Again" and "Is This Love", earning them a nomination for the Brit Award for Best British Group. Many metal artists, including Def Leppard, benefited from the exposure they received on ATV and became the inspiration for American Glam Metal. However, as the sub-genre fragmented, much of the creative impetus moved away from Britain to American and continental Europe (particularly Germany and Scandinavia), which produced most of the major new sub-genres of metal, which were then taken up by British acts. These included thrash metal and death metal, both developed in the UK; black metal and power metal, both developed in continental Europe, but influenced by the British band Venom; and doom, which was developed in the US, but which soon were adopted by a number of bands from England, including Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General.
Pop.
Phil Collins had five UK number one singles in the 80s, and when his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, Collins had more top 40 hits on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart during the 1980s than any other artist. His former Genesis colleague, Peter Gabriel, also had a very successful solo career, and had a hit duet with Kate Bush. Liverpool band Frankie Goes to Hollywood's initially controversial dance-pop gave them three consecutive UK number ones in 1984, until they faded away in the mid-1980s. Dead or Alive, also from Liverpool, was another popular dance pop band in the mid-1980s. It was fronted by lead singer Pete Burns.
Probably the most successful British pop band of the era were the duo Wham! with an unusual mix of disco, soul, ballads and even rap, who had eleven top ten hits in the UK, six of them number ones, between 1982 and 1986. George Michael released his debut solo album, "Faith" in 1987, and would go on to have seven UK number one singles. The 1985 concert Live Aid held at Wembley Stadium would see some of the biggest British artists of the era perform, with Queen stealing the show.
Bonnie Tyler had major hits with "Total Eclipse of the Heart" and "Holding Out for a Hero", while Robert Palmer's had two iconic music videos for "Addicted to Love" and "Simply Irresistible". The Bee Gees 1987 single "You Win Again" reached number one, making them first group to score a UK #1 hit in each of three decades: the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. Other British artists who achieved success in the pop charts in the 80s included Paul McCartney, Elton John, David Bowie, Joe Cocker, Rod Stewart, Billy Idol, Paul Young, Elvis Costello, Simple Minds, Billy Ocean, Tears for Fears, UB40, Madness and Sade.
In 1988 Irish singer Enya achieved a breakthrough in her career with the album "Watermark" which sold over eleven million copies worldwide and helped launch Enya's successful career as a leading New Age, Celtic, World singer. Dutch band Tambourine received some notoriety in The Netherlands and Belgium toward the end of the decade.
Synth pop.
Synthpop emerged from New Wave, producing a form of pop music that followed electronic rock pioneers in the 1970s like Kraftwerk, Jean Michel Jarre, and Tangerine Dream, in which the synthesizer is the dominant musical instrument. The sounds of synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s as well as replacing disco in dance clubs in Europe.
Other successful synthpop artists of this era included Pet Shop Boys, Alphaville, Soft Cell, Depeche Mode, New Order, The Human League, Thomas Dolby, Yazoo, Art of Noise, Heaven 17, A Flock of Seagulls, OMD, Japan, Thompson Twins, Visage, Ultravox, Kajagoogoo, Eurythmics, a-ha, Telex, Real Life, Erasure, Camouflage, London Boys, Modern Talking, Bananarama, Yellow Magic Orchestra, and others are bands of the synthpop style.
Latin America.
Pop.
The 1980s gives to the rise of teenage groups such as Menudo, Timbiriche, and Los Chicos, as well as child stars such as Luis Miguel. By 1988, however, the aforementioned Luis Miguel would transform into an adult superstar at age 18 with the hit "La Incondicional" (1989). Not too far behind was former Los Chicos' member Chayanne as he became a leading pop star by the end of the decade, with his 1987 hit "Fiesta en America". As young stars begin to rise in Latin music, veterans such as Julio Iglesias, José José, Juan Gabriel, and José Luis Rodríguez El Puma continue their dominance in Latin music. Argentine-Venezuelan singer Ricardo Montaner joins those veterans with his 1988 hit "Tan Enamorado". After the slow decline of Fania All-Stars, the new romantic genre of "salsa romantica" would rise beginning in 1984. Younger salseros such as Frankie Ruiz, Luis Enrique, and Eddie Santiago would take advantage of this new genre rising salsa to new heights. Tejano Music starts to give little rise after Mazz crosses over to Mexico after their albums Una Noche Juntos and No Te Olvidare win Grammys.
In 1989, Juan Luis Guerra scores a major Merengue hit with "Ojala que llueva cafe".
Rock.
The Rock en Español movement began around the 1980s. Until the mid-80s the rock scene of most Spanish American countries were not connected, and it was rare for a rock band to gain acclaim and popularity outside its homecountry.
Argentina, that had the largest national rock scene and music industry, became the birthplace of several influential rock acts. Soda Stereo from Buenos Aires is often acclaimed as the most influential rock band of the 80s alongside with the solo careers of Charly García, Luis Alberto Spinetta and the new star Fito Paez from Rosario. Soda Stereo was among the first bands to successfully tour across most of Latin America. Argentina developed also during the 80s a ska rock and punk rock scene. The punk movement, that was pioneered by Los Violadores, led to the rise of the Buenos Aires Hardcore around 1990.
In Chile, that was ruled by a military dictatorship all over the 80s, Nueva canción protest songs from the 60s and 70s maintained their popularity despite of severe censorship. The progressive/folk rock band Los Jaivas made a latinamerican trademark album with Alturas de Macchu Picchu based on Pablo Neruda's homonimus poem. The rock band Los Prisioneros were successful in combining the protest song atmosphere of the 80s with newer trends in rock including punk, ska, New Wave and techno. In late 1980s new bands such as Maná, Los Tres and La Ley would start to set the trends for the next decade.
Brazil saw the emergence of BRock.
Salsa.
The salsa music had developed in the 1960s and '70s by Puerto Rican and Cuban immigrants to the New York City area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The salsa music became together with cumbia the two most popular dance music but did not penetrate other countries outside the Caribbean as cumbia did.
The 1980s was a time of diversification, as popular salsa evolved into sweet and smooth salsa romantica, with lyrics dwelling on love and romance, and its more explicit cousin, salsa erotica. Salsa romantica can be traced back to "Noches Calientes", a 1984 album by singer José Alberto with producer Louie Ramirez. A wave of romantica singers, found wide audience among Latinos in both New York and Puerto Rico. The 1980s also saw salsa expand to Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Europe and Japan, and diversify into many new styles.
In the 1980s some performers experimented with combining elements of salsa with hip hop music, while the producer and pianist Sergio George helped to revive salsa's commercial success. He created a sound based on prominent trombones and rootsy, mambo-inspired style. He worked with the Japanese salsa band Orquesta de la Luz, and developed a studio orchestra that included Tito Nieves, Celia Cruz, José Alberto, La India, Tito Puente and Luis Enrique. The Colombian singer Joe Arroyo first rose to fame in the 1970s, but became a renowned exponent of Colombian salsa in the 1980s. Arroyo worked for many years with the Colombian arranger Fruko and his band Los Tesos.
Merengue.
Merengue music would hit its golden years during the 1980s starting in the late 70s with acts such as Wilfrido Vargas, Johnny Ventura, and Fernando Villalona. Their orchestras would also churn future solo acts such as Eddy Herrera and Rubby Perez. By the end of the decade, La Cocoband would reinvent merengue with a more comedic style.
Australia and New Zealand.
Australian rock band INXS achieved international success during the decade with a series of hit recordings, including the albums "Listen Like Thieves" (1985), "Kick" (1987), and the singles "Original Sin" (1984), "Need You Tonight" (1987), "Devil Inside" (1988) and "New Sensation" (1987).
Kylie Minogue first single, "Locomotion" became a huge hit in Minogue's native Australia spending seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart. The single eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the decade. Throughout Europe and Asia the song also performed well on the music charts, reaching number one in Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and South Africa. The Australian rock band Men at Work achieved success in 1981 with the single "Down Under" topping Australian charts for two consecutive weeks.
In 1980, New Zealand rock band Split Enz released their album "True Colours", which became an international success. Their single "I Got You", which was praised for its "Beatle-esque" chorus, reached the top ten in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, reached number twelve in the United Kingdom, and even charted the United States. Split Enz also received significant exposure in the United States upon the release of MTV, which featured several Split Enz videos in the early days of its broadcast. However, after several line-up changes, which included the departure of prominent member Tim Finn, the band broke up in 1984 (another prominent New Zealand/Australian band, Mi-Sex, known for its hit single "Computer Games", disbanded the same year). Neil Finn, the younger brother of Tim Finn who had become Split Enz's de facto front man after his departure in 1983, went on to form Crowded House in Australia in 1985. In 1986 Crowded House released their hugely successful self-titled debut album, which went to number one in Australia and number three in New Zealand, as well as reaching the top ten in Canada and top twenty in the United States. It spawned the song "Don't Dream It's Over", which hit number one in New Zealand and Canada, number two in the United States and number eight in Australia, and has since become a pop/rock anthem in Australasia. Crowded House's follow up album "Temple of Low Men", released in 1988, did not achieve the same success as their debut, but was still popular in the band's homelands of Australia and New Zealand...
Back at home, New Zealand continued to have a small and vibrant music scene, and the eighties saw the formation of many new bands, including The Swingers, Coconut Rough, The Crocodiles and Peking Man. Many of these bands were short-lived and did not see much success outside of New Zealand and Australia.
Asia.
In the Japan,bands such as Shonen Knife, The Star Club, X Japan and The Stalin began in the Japanese rock bands and Visual kei emerged in the 1980s with bands such as X Japan, Buck Tick and D'erlanger.
Japanese noise rock emerged in the 1980s with bands such as Melt-Banana, Zeni Geva and Guitar Wolf in the Japanese's indies scene.
The Japanese hardcore emerged with bands such as The Star Club and GISM and Japanese idol group Onyanko Club began as Idol group in the teen fans and youth fans.

Sebastián Herrera Barnuevo

Sebastián Herrera Barnuevo (1611 or 1619–1671) was a painter, architect, sculptor and etcher, who was born and died in Madrid, Spain. His father, Antonio Herrera, was a sculptor; after teaching his son, Sebastiano was taught by Alonzo Cano. Like Cano, Herrera worked for Philip IV of Spain, among others in the nobility. His was held to be modest and deeply religious.
His painting colors were brilliant and harmonized in the manner of Titian, however his style was so close Guido as to be sometimes indistinguishable. ("St. Barnabas" was long believed to be by Guido.)
At the end of the 19th century, most of his paintings were in Madrid. His best are considered the "St. Barnabas" in El Escorial, the "Beatification of St. Augustine" in the Chapel of the Augustinian Recollects and the "Nativity" in the San Jerónimo el Real. Another of his paintings is "Retrato de Carlos II niño con su madre la Reina Mariana de Austria" ("Portrait of King Carlos II as a child, with his mother Queen Mariana of Austria").

Edward Pritchett

Edward Pritchett (fl. 1828 – 1864) was a nineteenth-century English painter and man of mystery.
Nothing is known of Pritchett's life; he has appropriately been described as "elusive." He may have lived to 1879. Pritchett spent more than three decades living and working in Venice, producing admirable views of the city; he was one of a group of English artists who produced notable records of the scenes of northern Italy, a group that included John Wharlton Bunney, James Holland, the brothers-in-law Luke Fildes and Henry Woods, and, in a later generation, William Logsdail.

Briton Hammon

Briton Hammon was a slave in the middle of the 18th century, who, after leaving his master, may have encountered more hardships outside his sanctioned slavery than as a slave. He recorded, and published, his "uncommon" story as a slave and his many hardships. Some of these include being captured by Indians after the deaths of all persons but himself on the ship and being held in captivity twice, once for almost five years. He described many attempts of escaping his captives, almost ending his life in a very poor state, and finally prevailing as a free man.
Encounter with the Indians.
On December 25, 1747, Briton Hammon left Marshfield in Boston on his first expedition with the permission of his master, General Winslow. He intended to go to Plymouth and from there Jamaica. However on the June 15, 1748, the ship where Hammon was currently located was cast away, not far from the shore of Cape Florida. The captain ordered the ship’s crew to, in smaller groups; make for the shore in a smaller boat. At the point when half of the crew was ashore, they were attacked by a group of 60 Indians, who bound, and captured them. Then after killing the remaining crew, which was currently on the ship through burning the ship, returned and killed those who were bound. During which Hammon seeing his eminent death, attempted his escape in swimming away. This was an unsuccessful attempt however he was the only of the crew to survive, as he was held captive by the Indians, and despite his current state, was fed well. However, Hammon escaped due to an acquaintance on a Spanish ship, which arrived there from St. Augustine. The captain of which made a deal with the Indians, giving them 10 dollars to keep Hammon, as well as making sure they would not hereafter kill any other persons but capture as many as they could and bring them to the Captain for which they would be sold for 10 dollars.
Living in the Havanna.
After this venture, Hammon lived with the governor in the Castle. After about 12 months he (and others) was accosted in the street by a "Press-Gang" and taken to jail. He spent a night in jail, then refused to work upon a Spanish ship and was put in a dungeon, where he remained for almost five years. He petitioned prison visitors to communicate with the Governor. This was unsuccessful until a Mrs. Betty Howard pleaded his case to a visiting Boston ship's captain who visited Hammon in his "deplorable Condition" and secured his release through the Governor. The Governor sent an order to release him, and Hammon returned to live with him in the castle for about a year.
Attempts to Escape.
During his second period with the Governor, Hammon attempted to escape three times. The first attempt included him boarding a ship, where he then spent the night concealed. When it departed he revealed himself and the Captain of the ship ordered the boat back to return him to shore. After a time of living with the Governor again he made his second attempt to escape, again trying to board a ship, this time bound to Jamaica. He was, again, almost immediately sent back by order of the Guard. Hammon was promptly liberated, and ordered with quite a few other slaves to carry a Bishop through the country. He was employed in this way for about seven months.
His Liberty.
After working for Bishop for a time, Hammon was set free to work in his previous city and work for himself, no longer as a slave. And so seeing nothing further to do he left on a ship to Jamaica, and from there on to London. On his way to London the ship which he was aboard had a conflict with another ship, killing 70 and leaving him wounded in the head with a small shot, which left him incapable of working. He then stayed a while in the Greenwich Hospital, where he soon recovered. After working again for a short time, he was became sick with fever and was confined in London for six weeks. While ill he exhausted his money and was left in a very poor state. After recovering and while working aboard a ship, Hammon was reunited with his old master after nearly 13 years. Both were very delighted to be brought back together.

Silhouette racing car

A silhouette racing car is a race car which, although bearing a superficial resemblance to a production model, differs mechanically in fundamental ways. The purpose of silhouette cars is to provide a manufacturer with a tangible link to their consumer product offering so as to derive maximum marketing benefit from their investment in the sport. They also provide spectators with familiar car models with which they can identify.
Entire championship fields can consist of silhouettes, or sometimes only a single class in a multi-class field may permit silhouettes. Notable racing classes where silhouette cars have been used include NASCAR, Group 5 Special Production Cars, Group B rallying and DTM.
Silhouette cars often employ radically different chassis construction techniques such as tubular space frames or carbon fibre tubs in place of regular monocoques, and many also have completely different drivetrain configurations than their road-going counterparts. The bodyshells themselves are generally made of lightweight materials such as glass-reinforced plastic or carbon fibre and often few or no parts are shared between race and road versions of the cars. These changes are aimed at improving the desirable characteristics of the components, such as increasing the stiffness of the chassis, or the output of the engine. 
Due to homologation rules (e.g. Group B rally cars), some silhouette racing cars, such as the Lancia 037 and Lancia Delta S4, also end up being sold as road cars.

Since its foundation in 1971, the school has evolved into a one school – two system organisation. The European section offers all three International Baccalaureate Programmes (PYP, MYP, DP) in English. As a German government accredited “Excellent German School Abroad”, the German Section of GESS offers all German school leaving certificates. GESS focuses on European languages and culture. For Dutch students the school offers a mother-tongue programme fully integrated in the curriculum of the secondary level of the European section. It is developed in cooperation with Rijnsland Education Worldwide. A similar mother-tongue programme has been developed for Danish students as well, offering Danish lessons from preschool onwards. 
History.
The first lessons at the German School were taught on 25 August 1971 with six students enrolled. In April 1972, less than a year after the initial opening, the Kindergarten and Pre-School opened their doors. The school continued to grow quickly and the completion of a new school building at 72 Bukit Tinggi Road laid the foundation for what is now the GESS Main Campus. During 2004, the Board of Governors made the significant decision to offer students tuition in English as well as German and pursue accreditation with the International Baccalaureate Organisation. As a result, the school’s name was changed to the German European School Singapore (GESS). The following school year, the European (English speaking) section of the school started teaching the IB curriculum for grades 1 to 12. Growing student numbers, lead to the decision to open a separate Junior School campus at Jalan Jurong Kechil in August 2008. This is now home to students of both the German and European sections from grade 1 to 5. In 2010, the GESS pre-school department received accreditation to teach the Primary Years Programme IB curriculum and GESS became a fully certified, IB World School. In 2013, the accreditation by the Council of International Schools followed. 
Academic Programme.
Since the decision to offer multi-lingual education, GESS has operated in two distinct yet cohesive sections. The GESS European section offers the IB Programme in English and the German section uses the German language to teach all German school leaving certificates. To support the cohesion of its school community GESS teaches both German and English language lessons at differing levels in both sections.
The school places a great deal of emphasis on individualised support. That is why classes are kept small, thereby providing the opportunity for each student to realise its potential. As part of GESS’s approach to provide holistic education, students have numerous opportunities to engage in a large variety of creative and sporting activities, as well as embracing social responsibility through our community projects. 
In the toddler, kindergarten and pre-primary groups the youngest members of the school community learn and develop together through activities which stimulate social, intellectual and fine and gross motor skills. The groups are taught by native speaking teachers to allow the children to strengthen either their German or English language skills.
For a secondary language the school teaches Mandarin, French, Spanish, English, and German.
Campus.
The German European School Singapore (GESS) has two campuses located near to the Bukit Timah and Bukit Batok Nature Reserves respectively.

Battle of Ky Hoa

The Battle of Kỳ Hòa (Trận Đại đồn Chí Hòa) on 24 and 25 February 1861 was an important French victory in the Cochinchina campaign (1858–62). This campaign, fought between the French and the Spanish on the one side and the Vietnamese on the other, began as a limited punitive expedition and ended as a French war of conquest. The war concluded with the establishment of the French colony of Cochinchina, a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam.
Background.
After early French victories at Tourane and Saigon, the Cochinchina campaign reached a point of equilibrium with the French and their Spanish allies besieged in Saigon, which had been captured by a Franco-Spanish expedition under the command of Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly on 17 February 1859. The arrival of massive reinforcements from the French expeditionary corps in China in 1860 allowed the French to break the Siege of Saigon and regain the initiative.
The end of the Second Opium War in 1860 allowed the French government to despatch reinforcements of 70 ships under Admiral Léonard Charner and 3,500 soldiers under General de Vassoigne to Saigon. Charner's squadron, the most powerful French naval force seen in Vietnamese waters before the creation of the French Far East Squadron on the eve of the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885), included the steam frigates "Impératrice Eugénie" and "Renommée" (Charner and Page's respective flagships), the corvettes "Primauguet", "Laplace" and "Du Chayla", eleven screw-driven despatch vessels, five first-class gunboats, seventeen transports and a hospital ship. The squadron was accompanied by half a dozen armed lorchas purchased in Macao.
The battle of Ky Hoa.
The French and their Spanish allies were besieged in Saigon by a Vietnamese army around 32,000 strong under the command of Nguyen Tri Phuong. The Vietnamese siege lines, 12 kilometres long, were centred on the village of Ky Hoa (Vietnamese: Kỳ Hòa), and were known to the French as the 'Ky Hoa lines'. Ky Hoa itself had been transformed into a formidable entrenched camp:
The first objective was the capture of the entrenched camp of Ky Hoa. This was a rectangle measuring around 3,000 metres by 900 metres, divided into five compartments separated by traverses and enclosed within walls three and a half metres high and two metres thick. The camp was armed with more than 150 cannon of all calibres. Subsidiary defences were piled up in front of its walls: wolf-pits, ditches filled with water, palisades and chevaux de frise. Bamboo was employed in the defences with consummate art, and the walls were crowned with thorn bushes along their entire length. The number of enemy soldiers both in and around the fortified camp had grown steadily during the previous year. After the victory, we discovered from the muster rolls that there were 22,000 regular troops and 10,000 militiamen. There were also 15,000 men manning the forts along the upper course of the Donnai. All these men were under the command of Nguyen Tri Phuong, the most celebrated general in the Annamese army.
On 24 and 25 February 1861 the French attacked and captured the Ky Hoa lines.
The first assault was made on 24 February. The French artillery moved forward to a position one kilometre from the siege lines, and bombarded the Vietnamese defences. The French and Spanish infantry formed up behind the artillery positions in battalion columns. Then, at the canter, the mountain guns advanced to within 500 metres of Redoubt Fort ("fort de la Redoute") and the line of entrenchments that stretched away to the east. The rest of the artillery soon followed them, and when the infantry reached this new line it split up into two assault columns, the soldiers to the right led by "chef de bataillon du génie" Allizé de Matignicourt, and the sailors on the left under the command of "capitaine de frégate" Desvaux, captain of the transport "Entreprenante".
The French and Spanish assault columns charged, and captured Redoubt Fort and part of the Vietnamese trench lines. However, the attackers suffered heavily from Vietnamese fire. The French commander General de Vassoigne and the Spanish commander Colonel Palanca y Guttierez were both wounded in the attack.
A second assault was made on 25 February. The attack was made at dawn, by two columns of infantry supported by artillery. Thomazi gave the following description of the assault.
The action resumed at 5 a.m. on 25 February. The artillery advanced, facing east, enclosed by two columns of infantry: to the left, the engineers, the marine infantry and the "chasseurs"; to the right the Spanish infantry and the sailors. The sun, very low in the sky, was spoiling the aim of the cannons, and Lieutenant-Colonel Crouzat brought them forward by rapid bounds to within 200 metres of the enemy lines and ordered them to fire with case shot at the top of the ramparts. The firing was very heavy and our men, in the open, suffered appreciable casualties. Then the haversacks were laid on the ground, the sailors of the assault force reclaimed their scaling ladders, up to then carried by the coolies, and the admiral ordered the charge to be sounded.
The right column, led by "capitaine de vaisseau" de Lapelin, crossed the wolf pits, the ditches and the chevaux de frise which extended for more than 100 metres in front of the enemy work under an intense fire, and was the first to reach the parapet. Most of the scaling ladders, which were very light, had been broken during the advance. Only three were left, which were placed along the wall, and the sailors of the assault force who could not find a place there climbed on the shoulders of their comrades. This time the fighting was bitter indeed. The first men to reach the summit were killed, but others took their place, throwing grenades inside. Then, using grappling hooks, they breached the perimeter fence and entered the fort.
They then found themselves in an enclosed compartment swept by the fire from the neighbouring compartment, to which they could make no reply. It was a critical situation, and they suffered heavy losses. Finally, several resolute men, rallied by "lieutenant de vaisseau" Jaurès, succeeded in smashing in the gate that gave onto the other compartment with their axes, just as the engineers succeeded in breaking in, while the marine infantry and the chasseurs outflanked the enemy line on the left. The defenders were either killed where they stood or took to flight. The entire complex of the Ky Hoa lines had fallen into our hands.
Once again, French and Spanish casualties were relatively heavy (12 dead and 225 wounded). Many of the wounded, including Lieutenant-Colonel Testard, a marine infantry officer, later died as a result of their wounds. According to the French, the Vietnamese lost around 1,000 men, and their casualties included Nguyen Tri Phuong, who was wounded during the battle.
Aftermath.
The victory at Kỳ Hòa allowed the French and Spanish to move to the offensive. In April 1861, Mỹ Tho fell to the French. In early 1862 the French captured Biên Hòa and Vĩnh Long. These victories forced the Vietnamese to sue for peace in April 1862. By then the French were not in a merciful mood. What had begun as a minor punitive expedition had turned into a long, bitter and costly war. It was unthinkable that France should emerge from this struggle empty-handed, and Tự Đức was forced to cede the three southernmost provinces of Vietnam (Biên Hòa, Gia Định and Định Tường) to France. Thus, casually, was born the French colony of Cochinchina, with its capital at Saigon.

This was one of the most expensive elections in the nation, as more than $30 million was spent by outside organizations. Conservative third party groups hammered Bennet for voting 92% of the time with the Democratic leadership, including voting for healthcare reform and the stimulus package. Liberal third party groups called Buck extremist. Bennet focused on attacking Buck’s views on abortion, which he believed should be banned including those of cases of rape and incest. He was also attacked for wanting to eliminate the 17th Amendment and refusing to prosecute an alleged rapist as Weld County district attorney. Planned Parenthood mounted a mail campaign, targeting women voters with the warning that "Colorado women can’t trust Ken Buck." Bennet won the women vote by 17 points according to exit polls. After the election, Buck conceded to the Denver Post that the main reason why he lost is because of social issues.

Oak Ridge gatehouses

The three Oak Ridge gatehouses, also known as "checking stations", "guard houses", or "guard shacks", are security checkpoints in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, built c. 1948-1949 to control access to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) production and research facilities in Oak Ridge. These are individually listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as Bear Creek Road Checking Station, Bethel Valley Road Checking Station and Oak Ridge Turnpike Checking Station.
History.
The three gatehouses were built c. 1948-1949 and went into service on March 19, 1949, when the residential and commercial portion of Oak Ridge, known as the "townsite," was opened to public access. During World War II and until 1949, the entire Oak Ridge area had been enclosed by a fence and was restricted. Access was controlled at seven security gates equipped with wooden guardhouses. In 1949, access restrictions on the Oak Ridge townsite were eliminated. At that time, the three checking stations went into use to control access between the townsite and the AEC facilities. A station on Bethel Valley Road controlled access to the "X-10" site in Bethel Valley, where Oak Ridge National Laboratory is located; a station on Scarboro Road near Bear Creek Road controlled access to the Y-12 nuclear weapons production facility in Bear Creek Valley; and a station on Oak Ridge Turnpike (now part of Tennessee State Route 95) controlled access to the K-25 site uranium enrichment facility near the Clinch River in western Oak Ridge.
The structures were used for their intended purpose until 1953 when the gates to each of the three government sites were relocated to the specific sites. The three white Gatehouses remained in federal government ownership for many years, but stood vacant. In 1992, they were listed on the National Register as three separate properties, identified as the Oak Ridge Turnpike Checking Station, Bear Creek Road Checking Station, and Bethel Valley Road Checking Station. All three were included in a larger Multiple Property Submission for Oak Ridge-related properties. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the AEC-successor agency that currently controls the Bear Creek Road and Oak Ridge Turnpike properties, as well as the small structure on the Bethel Valley property, restored the large structures at the checking stations at the Oak Ridge Turnpike and Bear Creek Road sites. The large structure at the Bethel Valley Road site belongs to Lockheed Martin who obtained it with the Commerce Park property in 1984 when Martin Marietta took over the managing and operating contract for the three DOE sites in Oak Ridge as well as Portsmouth, Ohio and Paducah, KY. The Bethel Valley Road large structure was painted in 2005 but there has been no restoration or other attention to the interiors of the two Bethel Valley structures and the small structures at the other sites.
Design and uses.
Design of the three checking stations was identical. Each one consists of two concrete block buildings: a single-story main building with a two-story guard tower at one corner and a smaller one-story guard house across the street. Gun portals are visible on both buildings in each pair, and the windows on both buildings are protected by bulletproof glass. Military police controlled a metal gate that extended between the pair of buildings. Workers and visitors had to show special badges to the guards in order to pass through the gates.
The two restored gatehouses are now fitted with period and replica furniture from the 1940s and 1950s and decorated with historic photographs by Ed Westcott. They are used as meeting rooms and for educational, cultural, and civic activities sponsored by DOE. In 2010, the Tennessee Department of Transportation began a project to widen State Route 95 in the vicinity of the Oak Ridge Turnpike checking station with a road design that does not affect the checking station. The design for the widened roadway calls for five lanes and a sidewalk in the segment that passes between the two gatehouse structures.

The 2010 United States Senate election in Hawaii took place on November 2, 2010 concurrently with elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. The primary elections were held on September 18, 2010. Incumbent Democrat U.S. Senator and President pro tempore Daniel Inouye won re-election to his ninth and final term. Inouye died two years into his ninth term on December 17, 2012.
Background.
Hawaii last elected a Republican Senator in 1970, and its current delegation to the United States Congress currently consists entirely of Democrats. Democrats have also won Hawaii's electoral votes in every presidential election since Ronald Reagan's landslide election in 1984. The exceptions at the time were then-Governor Linda Lingle (who was serving her second and final term) and then-U.S. Representative Charles Djou, both of whom are Republicans.
General election.
Campaign.
The death of longtime U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd allowed Inouye to become the President pro tempore and Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations. He has no apologies for bringing home as much federal money as he can, despite Republican insistence that the U.S. government taxes and spends too much, a stance he calls a "nice gimmick." The "Maui News" has endorsed his re-election.
Cavasso, the 2004 nominee, is running again and won the Republican primary again. He is running on a platform of change and is emphasizing the need for a balanced budget. Inouye, who defeated Cavasso in 2004 by 52 percentage points, released TV ads that refer to him simply as "Dan". The senator is said to be "working" for Hawaii's transportation, high-tech economy, education and other needs.

Tuần Châu

Tuần Châu is a schist island on the south-west side of Hạ Long City in Vietnam. Covered by pine forest, has an area of 2.2 km² and to the east and south are two man made beaches endowed with very white, fine sand. The octagonal house where President Hồ Chí Minh stayed when he vacationed here has now become a memorial site. Nowadays, Tuần Châu Island is one of the most touristic destinations in Hạ Long City.
Tuần Châu is in an important position at the entrance of the waterway system of Thăng Long, Bặch Đằng and Vân Ðồn. This is why in the feudal time, the royal army set up a guard station here to patrol and defend the borderland. The Office of Feudal Customs was also installed there.
The island also has many archaeological sites pertaining to the ancient Hạ Long culture from 3,000 to 5,000 years ago.
One can go to Tuần Châu Island via the 2-km cement road from the mainland. Construction of this road was officially started on February 28, 1998. Investments have been poured into the island to turn it into a modern tourist resort. It includes attractions such as the dolphin, sea lion, and performing-seal club, animal circus club, golf course, cultural-sports center, beach, rural market, ornamental fish lake, villas in Hill 1 and Hill 2, guesthouses, five 80-room villas by the beach. The ensemble of five restaurants and one round house built in the pagoda motif can serve up to 500 guests at the same time.
In 2004, Miss Vietnam was held here. In 2005, Tuần Châu was where "Vietnam: The Island of Mr. Sang" episode of "" was filmed.

Recruited from Hawksburn originally, Wilson played two senior VFL games, the first came in the inaugural season in 1897 against Geelong at Corio Oval and the other at Junction Oval in 1900 against Melbourne. He later served as a club secretary. While a St Kilda player he made three first-class cricket appearances for his state, as a right-handed batsman, all in the 19th century and against Tasmania. 
Wilson moved to New Zealand to live after he was finished as a footballer and made his first-class debut in the country when he took the field for the South Island versus Lord Hawke's XI at Dunedin.

United States Senate election in Illinois, 2010

The 2010 United States Senate elections in Illinois took place on November 2, 2010. There were 2 ballot items for the same seat: a routine one, to fill the Class 3 seat beginning with the 112th United States Congress beginning on January 3, 2011, and a special item, to fill that seat for the final weeks of the 111th Congress, replacing the temporary appointment of Roland Burris to the vacancy created by Barack Obama's election to the presidency.
The election took place alongside 33 other elections to the United States Senate in other states, as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections in Illinois and other states. The registered party primaries for the full term took place on February 2, 2010, the earliest state primary elections: U.S. Congressman Mark Kirk was nominated as the Republican nominee, journalist LeAlan Jones was nominated as the Green nominee, and State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias was nominated as the Democratic nominee. The Constitution Party and Libertarian Party submitted signatures to be on the ballot but were challenged; the result of the ensuing hearings was the Constitution Party's candidate being denied placement on the ballot but the Libertarian Party's candidate Michael Labno given ballot access.
On August 2, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that the candidates appearing on the ballot for the replacement election will be the ones of the regular election, and that the replacement item will appear after the regular item on the ballot. Sitting senator Roland Burris would not appear on either ballot item.
Background.
Vacancy.
Barack Obama, the former United States Senator holding this seat, was elected President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and resigned from the Senate November 16, 2008. Illinois law provides for the Governor of Illinois to appoint replacements for Senate vacancies.
Burris's appointment.
On December 9, 2008, the FBI arrested the Governor, Rod Blagojevich (D) on various corruption charges, including allegations he sought to sell the appointment to the U.S. Senate. On December 31, 2008, Blagojevich nevertheless appointed Roland Burris to fill the vacancy. After initially seeking to exclude Burris, Senate Democrats relented, and Burris was seated on January 15, 2009.
Burris later declined to run for re-election.
Democratic primary.
Campaign.
Incumbent Senator Roland Burris did not run for a full term in 2010. Burris suffered from poor approval ratings and was investigated by the Sangamon County, Illinois State's Attorney for perjury. Although no criminal charges were filed against him, Burris faced an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee. 
Jacob Meister withdrew from campaigning and declared his support for Alexi Giannoulias on January 31, two days before the February 2 election.
General election.
Campaign.
A self-described "fiscal conservative and social moderate," Republican nominee Mark Kirk has based his campaign on reform and compared the race to Republican Scott Brown's election to the Senate in February 2010. In addition, Kirk immediately criticized his Democratic opponent for his management of Bright Start, an Illinois 529 college savings program and his work at Broadway Bank. Immediately after the primary, the National Republican Senatorial Committee aired a web ad comparing Giannoulias to the fictional character Tony Soprano. Politifact has ranked Kirk's references to the mob as "Half True". Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown has campaigned for Kirk in Illinois. Kimberly Vertolli, Kirk's ex-wife, signed on as an advisor to Mark Kirk's campaign, but doesn't support his more conservative platform.
On February 4, 2010, Democrat Alexi Giannoulias revealed his campaign strategy, saying "come November, Congressman, your days as a Washington insider are over." On July 19, 2010, Giannoulias announced that he had raised $900,000 in the quarter that ended June 30, compared to $2.3 million raised by Kirk. The Giannoulias campaign also announced that President Obama was scheduled to attend an August 5 fundraiser for his candidate in Chicago.
Kirk and Giannoulias disagree mostly on fiscal and foreign policy. Kirk voted against Obama's Stimulus package and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As a Congressman, Kirk originally voted for Cap and trade but during the primary campaign announced that if elected a Senator he would vote against it. Giannoulias strongly supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. and Obama's stimulus. Kirk opposes the building of the Park 51 Islamic center near Ground Zero of New York City, while Giannoulias believes that "Americans must stand up for freedom of religion even when it's difficult."
Labno was added to the ballot by the Illinois State Board of Elections after gaining ballot access by means of citizen petition. Labno will face Republican Mark Kirk, Democrat Alexi Giannoulias and Green Party candidate LeAlan Jones in the general election in November 2010. He was raised in the suburbs of Chicago. He currently resides in Oak Brook, Illinois, a village in DuPage and Cook Counties. Labno is an electrical project construction manager. Labno is also a recruiter for Private Security Union Local 21. Labno is pro-life and supports 2nd Amendment rights, downsizing or cutting some Federal agencies and reducing taxes and government regulations. He also supports allowing citizens to opt out of Social Security. In August 2010, Democratic candidate Alexi Giannoulias declared Labno a legitimate challenge from the right for Mark Kirk. Labno responded on his Facebook fan page, saying "This is very true Alexi, and you should be afraid too.”
Labno attended the September 18, 2010 Right Nation rally in Hoffman Estates, Illinois headlined by conservative media figure Glenn Beck. While greeting attendees Labno noted that Republican candidate Kirk did not attend. He has been contacting Tea Party grassroots organizations in Illinois to discuss the Senate race. On August 27 the Illinois Board of Elections approved the Libertarian Party's petition to include its candidates on the ballot.

Harry E. Donnell

Harry Ellingwood Donnell (May 2, 1867 – February 25, 1959) was an American Beaux-Arts architect, who designed many commercial and residential structures in New York City and Long Island between 1894 and 1915.
Life.
Donnell (don-Nell) was born in Portland, Maine. The Donnell family moved to New York City in 1875. Donnell graduated from City College of New York in 1886 and the Columbia School of Mines in 1887. In 1890 he was hired by architect Richard Morris Hunt to serve as the superintending architect for the construction of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.
Donnell attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, entering in 1893 and returning to the United States in 1894. He entered into partnership with another Beaux-Arts architect, Francis Kimball in 1895. Their firm designed many building in lower Manhattan including 111 Fifth Avenue, and the Brunswick Building at 225 Fifth Avenue. From 1900 to 1915, Donnell designed numerous residential homes on the North Shore of Long Island including community libraries such as the Carnegie Library in Northport, New York.
In 1915, his father-in-law, George Hazard Robinson, who was a well-known New York City financier, offered Donnell the opportunity to own and manage one of Robinson's Long Island companies, the S.S. Hepworth Machine Company, the largest manufacturer of rotating milling machines for the sugar cane industry. Donnell spent the remainder of his life as the Chief Executive Officer of Hepworth, utilizing his architectural skills only as a pastime.
Donnell married Ruth Attmore Robinson (1870–1949). They lived in New York City and also maintained a country home on on Eatons Neck, NY known as "The Hill." In 1927 the estate was subdivided into 3- and 4-acre parcels, and the Eaton Harbors Corporation was formed to own and maintain the private roads and bathing beaches for the common use of new owners. Donnell was the corporation's president from 1927 to 1950.
From 1907 to 1921 Donnell served as sole trustee of the Eaton's Neck School District. The District was merged with other surrounding school districts to form the Northport-East Northport Union Free School District in 1922.
Donnell died in New York City on 25 February 1959.

Amanat

Amanat was an Indian soap opera that premiered on Zee TV on August 21, 1997. The series was one of the most popular Hindi television program of its time and received the highest television rating points (TRPs) of 19 among many other 2000s Hindi language shows. The story focuses on the life of a man with seven beautiful and dutiful daughters. 
This was one of the most successful TV serials of its time.
Synopsis.
The story is about a staunchly traditional Indian man, Lahori Ram, who holds a strong set of values and beliefs. His life revolves around his seven daughters: Santosh, Dinky, Bala, Guddi, Bunty, Munni, and Totey, each with her own peculiarities and problems.
Lahori Ram, who is originally from Pakistan, moves to India after the partition between the countries. The world has progressed — or grown corrupt, depending on how you look at it — but his values and traditions have not changed with the advent of modern times. Having lost his wife early in life, he has been both father and mother to his girls. He has lavished all his love and affection on them and kept them in the constraints of a stern middle-class morality. The bond between the sisters is extremely close. Not having a mother in their formative years has forged among them a strong comradeship. Their shared moments of happiness and grief, their love and admiration for their father, and the desire never to hurt him are their common ground.
It is only when they get married and go into different families, with varied backgrounds and cultural environments, some rich, some poor, that real conflicts start. For each, it is a struggle between fealty to the family of the husband and the love they have for their sisters. Lahori Ram is supportive like a rock and compassionate as a parent can be without hurting one for the sake of the other. But it is a tricky tightrope which he treads with skill. Like the tributaries of a mighty river, the life of each girl breaks free from the confines of family and flows to a distant place, while still being a part of the older stream. Lahori Ram, too, follows the happiness and heartaches of his daughters with fond indulgence and parental concern. They are his “amanat” (bounty), reared with love and bestowed one by one like a bounty on someone else. Each parent goes through these profound experiences, sooner or later, when daughters come of age, and depart as brides, leaving behind only sweet memories.

<doc id="19753612" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19753612" title="Black silicon">
Black silicon

Black silicon is a semiconductor material, a surface modification of silicon with very low reflectivity and correspondingly high absorption of visible (and infrared) light. The modification was discovered in the 1980s as an unwanted side effect of reactive ion etching (RIE). Another method for forming a similar structure was developed in Eric Mazur's laboratory at Harvard University (1998).
Properties.
Black silicon is a needle-shaped surface structure where needles are made of single-crystal silicon and have a height above 10 µm and diameter less than 1 µm. Its main feature is an increased absorption of incident light—the high reflectivity of the silicon, which is usually 20–30% for quasi-normal incidence, is reduced to about 5%. This is due to the formation of a so-called effective medium by the needles. Within this medium, there is no sharp interface, but a continuous change of the refractive index that reduces Fresnel reflection. When the depth of the graded layer is roughly equal to the wavelength of light in silicon (about one-quarter the wavelength in vacuum) the reflection is reduced to 5%; deeper grades produce even blacker silicon. For low reflectivity, the nanoscale features producing the index graded layer must be smaller than the wavelength of the incident light to avoid scattering.
Applications.
The unusual optical characteristics, combined with the semiconducting properties of silicon make this material interesting for sensor applications. Potential applications include: 
Production by reactive-ion etching.
In semiconductor technology, reactive-ion etching (RIE) is a standard procedure for producing trenches and holes with a depth of up to several hundred micrometres and very high aspect ratios. In Bosch process RIE, this is achieved by repeatedly switching between an etching and passivation. With cryogenic RIE, the low temperature and oxygen gas achieve this sidewall passivation by forming SiO2, easily removed from the bottom by directional ions. Both RIE methods can produce black silicon, but the morphology of the resulting structure differs substantially. The switching between etching and passivation of the Bosch process creates undulated sidewalls, which are visible also on the black silicon formed this way.
During etching, however, small debris remain on the substrate; they mask the ion beam and produce structures that are not removed and in the following etching steps and result in tall silicon pillars. The process can be set so that a million needles are formed on an area of one square millimeter.
Production by Mazur's method.
Material.
In 1999, a group led by Eric Mazur and James Carey at the Harvard University developed a process in which black silicon was produced by irradiating silicon with femtosecond laser pulses. After irradiation in the presence of a gas containing sulfur hexafluoride and other dopants, the surface of silicon develops a self-organized microscopic structure of micrometer-sized cones. The resulting material has many remarkable properties, such as an enhanced absorption that extends to the infrared below the band gap of silicon, including the wavelengths for which unmodified silicon is transparent. This property is caused by sulfur atoms being forced to the silicon surface, creating a structure with a lower band gap and therefore the ability to absorb longer wavelengths.
Similar surface modification can be achieved in vacuum using the same type of laser and laser processing conditions. In this case, the individual silicon micro-cones lack sharp tips (see image). The reflectivity of such a micro-structured surface is very low, 3-14% in the spectral range 350–1150 nm. Such reduction in reflectivity is considered to be contributed by the geometry of these micro-cones, which increases the light internal reflections between them. Hence, the possibility of light absorption by the silicon is increased. The gain in absorption achieved by fs laser texturization is found to be superior to that achieved by using an alkaline chemical etch method, which is a standard industrial approach for surface texturing of mono-crystalline silicon wafers in solar cell manufacturing. It is also found that such surface modification is independent of local crystalline orientation. A uniform texturing effect can be achieved across the whole surface of a multi-crystalline silicon wafer. The very steep angles lower the reflection to near zero and also increase the probability of recombination, which is why it thus far has not been used in solar cell manufacturing.
Function.
When the material is biased by a small electric voltage, absorbed photons are able to excite dozens of electrons. The sensitivity of black silicon detectors is 100–500 times higher than that of untreated silicon (conventional silicon), in both the visible and infrared spectra.
Uses and commercialization.
The material has not yet found commercial applications but potentially could find in a number of photodetectors for various imaging and night vision applications. Black silicon is currently being commercialized by SiOnyx, a Massachusetts-based venture-funded startup company which acquired licensing for the process from Harvard in 2006.
Black silicon also has potential application for high-efficiency solar cells, which is being explored by Solasys, an EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded demonstration project aiming at lowering manufacturing costs while increasing cell efficiency at the same time.
A group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has reported black silicon solar cells with 18.2% confirmed efficiency. This black silicon anti-reflective surface was formed by a metal-assisted etch process using nano particles of silver.
A team led by Elena Ivanova at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne discovered in 2012 that cicada wings were potent killers of "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", an opportunist germ that also infects humans and is becoming resistant to antibiotics.
Looking closely, they found that the answer lay not in any biochemical on the wing, but in regularly-spaced "nanopillars" on which bacteria were sliced to shreds as they settled on the surface.
The cicada wings and black silicon were put through their paces in a lab, and both were ruthlessly bactericidal.
Smooth to the human touch, the surfaces destroyed Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as bacterial spores.
The three targeted bacterial species comprised "P. aeruginosa", the notorious "Staphylococcus aureus" and the ultra-tough spore of "Bacillus subtilis", a wide-ranging soil germ that is a cousin of anthrax. 
The killing rate was 450,000 bacterial cells per square centimetre per minute over the first three hours of exposure.
This is 810 times the minimum dose needed to infect a person with "S. aureus", and 77,400 times that of "P. aeruginosa".

United States Senate election in Indiana, 2010

The 2010 United States Senate election in Indiana took place on November 2, 2010, alongside 33 other elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections to fill Indiana's class III United States Senate seat. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Evan Bayh decided in February 2010 to retire instead of seeking a third term shortly after former U. S. Senator Dan Coats announced his candidacy for Bayh's contested seat. No Democrat candidate submitted enough signatures by the deadline to run, leading Democratic officials to choose U.S. Congressman Brad Ellsworth to be the nominee. The Libertarian Party nominated YMCA instructor Rebecca Sink-Burris, who had previously ran against Evan Bayh in the United States Senate election in Indiana, 1998 but with less success than in this election. Republican nominee and former U.S. Senator Dan Coats won the open seat.
Democratic nomination.
Senate candidates in Indiana were required to have submitted 500 signatures from each of the state's nine congressional districts by February 16, 2010, one day after Bayh announced his retirement. Democrat leaders thought the popular incumbent would run for reelection, and as a result, no Democrat candidate had submitted the requisite signatures by the deadline to run in the state's primary, meaning that the Indiana Democratic Party's executive committee chose the party's nominee. U.S. congressman Brad Ellsworth was officially selected on May 15.
General election.
Campaign.
After Coats’ win in the Republican primary, Ellsworth began to heavily criticized Coats for his ties to lobbyists. He called for more disclosure of the meetings lawmakers have with lobbyists, banning congressional staff from lobbying for six years after their congressional jobs, requiring Congress members to put all their investments in blind trusts, more disclosure of Senate candidates’ personal financial information, and changes to the U.S. Senate filibuster rules. He proposed lowering number of votes required to break a filibuster to 55 from the current 60. In response to Ellsworth's charges, Coats published his lobbying record in a 815 page document.
Coats emphasized the individual issues rather than ethic reforms advocated by his opponent. He focused on Ellsworth record of voting in support of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, cap-and-trade legislation, and health care bill. Coats opinion of the healthcare law is that “the only responsible solution ... is to repeal the Obama-Pelosi-Ellsworth health spending bill and quickly replace it with cost-effective, incremental pieces that will decrease costs, increase coverage and not break the bank.”
Debates.
The three candidates took part in three televised debates.

Front Palace

Front Palace ( ) is the colloquial name for the residence, person and office of Krom Phra Rajawang Bovorn Sathan Mongkol ( pronunciation), which was the Siamese monarchy's equivalent of the viceroyal office of Uparat ( RTGS: upparat) until the end of the nineteenth century. The office-holder was considered second only to the King, and the heir presumptive. The office is also referred to in English as "Vice King" and "Second King." It originated in the Ayutthaya period and later gained significant powers during the Rattanakosin period. Front Palace occupants were usually a son or brother of the reigning monarch. The office existed until the death of the last occupant, Prince Vichaichan, in 1885. King Chulalongkorn then abolished the office of an heir presumptive, introducing in its stead the Western concept of a crown prince as heir apparent, and styled the new office "Crown Prince of Siam."
Ayutthaya period.
The "Uparaja" or "Uparat" concept of a Viceroy was of Greater Indian origin. In 1448, Sukhothai King Trailokanat was crowned as the king of Ayutthaya, uniting the two kingdoms. During the 15th century, the Kingdom of Sukhothai, which centered on Pitsanulok, served as the seat of most of "Uparat"s, as they were, with few exceptions, also king of Sukhothai. After the first fall of Ayutthaya in 1569, Maha Thammaracha crowned his son Naresuan as "Uparat" and king of Sukhothai/Pitsanulok. Naresuan then had a palace built in front of his Royal Palace, to be his son's place of residence when visiting Ayutthaya - thereby giving rise to the name "Front Palace." In 1583, Naresuan annexed the Sukhothai kingdom to Ayutthaya, and Pitsanulok ceased to be the seat of the "Uparat". After his coronation, Naresuan appointed his brother Ekathotsarot to be the Uparat, stating that his brother in the Front Palace had equal status to the King in the Royal Palace.
Phetracha in 1688 appointed his son Luang Sorasak (later Sanpet VIII) as the Uparat living at the Front Palace. For the first time the descriptive term used was ""Krom Phrarajawang Bovorn Sathan Mongkol"" ( (lit. The Great Auspicious Place). The Uparat was usually the brother of the king, and only heir presumptive to the throne, not heir apparent. This created an air of uncertainty about the succession upon the death of the king; keeping the heir close at hand in the Great Auspicious Place proved a means for keeping an eye on him, lest he presume too much. When the Uparat died before the king, the title often remained vacant for several years, until the King deigns to appoint a new vice-king.
Rattanakosin period.
With the foundation of the Chakri dynasty in 1782, Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke made his younger brother Bunma the Front Palace (as Maha Sura Singhanat). Maha Sura Singhanat supervised the construction of Front Palace in Bangkok. Later Front Palaces continued the expansion of the palace. Prince Isarasundhorn was the only Front Palace who did not reside in the Front Palace but instead lived at the Thonburi Palace. Ironically, with the exception of Prince Isarasundhorn (who succeeded to the throne as Buddha Loetla Nabhalai), none of the Rattanakosin Front Palaces were actually crowned as they were mostly the monarch's siblings. During this time the Vice-King resided in the Front Palace (วังหน้า: Wang Na) north of the Grand Palace, which is now the main building of the National Museum.
The Front Palaces during the Rattanakosin period wielded greatf power, with their own private army and even a navy. In 1851, King Mongkut made his brother Pinklao the Front Palace and then crowned him as a King equal in rank to himself, as was the case of Naresuan and Ekatotsarot. Pinklao also received all the styles and titles usually reserved only for the monarch; to Europeans he refers to himself as the Second King. In 1868, after the coronation of young Chulalongkorn, Sri Suriyawongse his regent arranged the grant of the title of Front Palace to Pinklao's son Prince Yingyot, as Front Palace Bovorn Vichaichan.
Though the office had been superseded, Somdej Pramahitathibej Adulyadejvikrom Prabarommarajajanok held an equivalent rank.
End to the system.
The conflicts between the reformist King Chulalongkorn and conservative Vice King came to a head in the so-called Front Palace Crisis in 1874 - a fire in the Grand Palace was attributed to the Vice-King Bovorn Vichaicharn, who sought protection in the British consulate. The crisis started due to the fast-paced reforms started by the young King Chulalongkorn. As a result the reforms were stalled for several years, and when the Vice-King died in 1885 the whole Uparath system was abolished by the King. Instead he named his son as heir and Crown Prince.
"See also:" Crown Prince of Thailand
List of the Front Palaces.
Rattanakosin.
With the death of Vichaichan, Chulalongkorn did not appoint any new Front Palaces. In 1886, Chulalongkorn made his son Prince Maha Vajirunhis, "Crown Prince of Siam", therefore abolishing the title of Front Palace altogether.
Rear Palace.
Around the time of Luang Sorasak's appointment, King Phetracha also appointed a Third King, Krom Phrarajawang Bovorn Sathan Phimuk ( or Rear Palace ( ). Nai Chobkojprasit, a commoner, was appointed to the position. He, however, fell out of favour at some time during the king's reign and was executed. Around 1703, King Sanpet VIII appointed Prince Petch, his first-born son, as the Front Palace and younger son Prince Porn as Rear Palace. Because of the inauspicious end of the first Rear Palace, the King decided to change the title of the Front and Rear Palaces to Phra Bantoon Yai (พระบัณฑูรใหญ่) and Phra Bantoon Noi (พระบัณฑูรน้อย) respectively. The literal translation is "Big" and "Little Royal Command," thus analogous to the naval ranks of Commander and Lieutenant Commander. The titles were later merged. 
Prince Anurak Devesh, a nephew of King Rama I, was the only Rear Palace appointed during the Rattanakosin period, in 1785. After his death in 1806, the office went vacant. Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok is now on the site of the former Rear Palace.

United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010

The 2010 United States Senate election in Nevada took place on November 2, 2010. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator and Majority Leader Harry Reid won re-election to a fifth term.
Democratic primary.
The Democratic primary took place on June 8, 2010. Reid won by a large margin over a field of political unknowns.
Republican primary.
The Republican primary also took place on Tuesday, June 8, 2010.
Polling.
"Includes current candidates who have polled at least 2% in at least one poll."
General election.
Campaign.
In January 2009, the GOP began running an advertisement attacking Reid for his support of the legislation and President Barack Obama's proposed stimulus plan. Since becoming Minority Leader (in 2004), his approval ratings have dropped below 50%. A November 2007 poll showed Reid's approval rating at 39%, with 49% of voters disapproving.
After the primaries, the first poll showed Angle leading by a double-digit margin. CQ Politics changed their analysis of the race from leaning Republican to a toss-up because of Angle's sharply conservative views and tendency to commit verbal gaffes; however, CQ added that if the voters treat the election as a referendum on Reid, then Angle will likely win.
In 2009, Reid had been endorsed by some prominent Nevada Republicans. Immediately after the primary, the Republican mayor of Reno, Bob Cashell, who had backed Lowden in the Republican primary, endorsed Reid for the general election, calling Angle an "ultra-right winger." Other Republicans expressed doubt about supporting Angle, citing her reputation for ideological rigidity from her years in the state legislature.
One of the first general election ads attacked Angle for her stance on Social Security and Medicare. In response, Angle explained that "the government must continue to keep its contract with seniors, who entered into the system on good faith and now are depending on that contract." In response to accusations that she was not mainstream enough for Nevada voters, Angle explained on a KXNT radio show that she was "more mainstream than the fellow that said tourists stink, this war is lost, and light-skinned no-Negro dialect", in reference to comments that had been made by Senator Reid.
In September, Tibi Ellis, the chairwoman of the Nevada Republican Hispanic Caucus, who had been a spokesperson for Angle, criticized an Angle ad related to immigration. Ellis said, "I condemned this type of propaganda, no matter who is running them, where they blame Mexicans as the only problem and where they attack them as the only source of illegal immigration."
Angle was endorsed by Nevada's largest newspaper, the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Reid had the endorsement from Nevada's second largest newspaper, the Las Vegas Sun. and the largest newspaper outside of Las Vegas, the Reno Gazette-Journal.
On October 7, 2010, Republican State Senator and Minority Leader William Raggio endorsed Reid. Dema Guinn, the widow of the late Republican Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn, endorsed Reid on October 8.
Debate.
Angle and Reid only agreed to one debate, in which no other candidate would participate. It was held on October 14. Junior Senator John Ensign played Reid during one day of debate preparation at the Trump Plaza in Las Vegas for Angle.
Predictions.
History.
Reid was initially considered vulnerable, with the non-partisan "Cook Political Report" rating the election as a tossup and the "Rothenberg Political Report" rating the state as tossup. A June 9, 2010, Rasmussen Reports post-primary poll showed Angle leading incumbent Senator Harry Reid by a margin of 50% to 39%. However, a July 2010 poll showed Senator Reid leading Angle by 7 points, following nationwide attention to some of Angle's positions, as well as the endorsement of Reid by prominent Republicans. The change of margin, 18% in less than a month, is the largest in Senate elections history. On July 28, 2010, Rasmussen Reports moved the race from tossup to leans Democratic. Later, it moved back to tossup.

Parker Chapin Flattau &amp; Klimpl

Parker Chapin Flattau & Klimpl was a New York City-based law firm that practiced from 1934 to 2001, when it merged with Dallas-based Jenkens & Gilchrist. It was a prominent mid-sized New York firm, often called a corporate and securities boutique because of its highly regarded middle market securities practice which also embraced securities litigation and arbitration. Its securities clients, according to electronic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, included Sbarro, Sotheby's and Logitech. 
Parker Chapin was also known for its close association with New York City municipal law and real estate developments within the city. The firm numbered some 125 attorneys when it merged with Jenkens & Gilchrist to rebrand under the name Jenkens & Gilchrist Parker Chapin. In 2005, the Parker Chapin partners defected to open a New York office for the Atlanta firm Troutman Sanders. Altogether some 90 attorneys made the move, though the office remained in the same location, in the iconic Chrysler Building. The New York partners had become disenchanted by the massive liabilities that Jenkens was experiencing stemming from its tax shelter practice out of its Chicago office, which eventually led to the collapse of Jenkens.

Ambikapathy (1937 film)

Ambikapathy (also spelled as Ambikapathi) is a 1937 Tamil film directed by American film director Ellis R. Dungan. It starred M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, M. R. Santhanalakshmi, Serugulathur Sama, T. S. Balaiya, N. S. Krishnan, T. A. Madhuram and P. G. Venkatesan. Ambikapathy is regarded as one of the greatest hits of pre-independence Tamil cinema. Ambikapathy, along with "Chintamani" were the greatest hits of 1937 and made critics regard him as the "first superstar of Tamil cinema". This was the first Tamil film to name a music director in its credits.
Production.
The film highlighted the Romeo-Juliet type romance between Bhagavathar and Santhanalakshmi. Dungan who did not know Tamil, used Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet as an inspiration and incorporated some of its scenes in the script. The writer for the film was the Tamil scholar Thanigachalam working under the pen name "Elangovan". He translated the scenes Dungan had marked out from Shakespeare into Tamil. One of them was the balcony scene. The lines describing Romeo taking leave of Juliet - "Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast", were translated by Elangovan as "Thookkam Un Kangalai Thazhuvattum! Amaithi Un Nenjil Nilavattum". Dungan also introduced some daring (for that time period) intimate scenes like Ambikapathi carrying Amaravathi to the bed and Ambikapathi winking at her. The poet Kambar was played by Serugalathur Sama whose appearance was based on that of Rabindranath Tagore. T. S. Balaiya was cast as the villain Rudrasenan. The comic relief was provided by the husband and wife comedy team of N. S. Krishnan - T. A. Madhuram. The film was shot in East India Studio in Calcutta. Background score was composed by K. C. Dey, while Papanasam Sivan composed music and wrote lyrics for the Songs. The completed film was 19,000 fet in length (runtime : 210 minutes). 
Initially, the producer M. S. Thottana Chettiar, wanted Y. V. Rao to direct the film, but buoyed by the success of"Chintamani", Rao demanded a huge amount of money as payment which the producers could not afford. Instead they hired the up-and-coming American film director Eungan. Ellis R. Dungan, on hearing the story, immediately agreed to direct the film. A"devadasi" had earlier been chosen to form the lead pair with M.K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar in the movie. But she refused when she discovered that M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar was not a Brahmin and she had to be teamed up with another Brahmin actor in a minor role. M. R. Santhanalakshmi, a popular stage actress was cast as Amaravathi.
Plot.
The film is based on a story set in the Chola Empire in year 1083 AD. The titular character in the story is Ambikapathy (M K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar), the son of the Tamil poet Kambar (Serugulathur Sama) who is in love with the Chola princess and daughter of Kulothunga Chola, Amaravati (played by M. R. Santhanalakshmi). The king objects to their love and insists on testing Ambikapathy's literary mettle before judging his worth. The test given to Ambikapathi is that he should write and sing a hundred poems in the field of "Puram" (dealing with war and politics). The poems should not have any reference to the field of "Aram" (dealing of love and romance). Ambikapathi begins the test in the King's court with a "Kadavul Vaazhthu"(invocation to God). Amaravathi who is keeping the count, mistakes the invocation as a poem and counts it as poem number one. When he has sung only ninety nine "Puram" poems, she thinks he has completed the task and signals him that hundred poems have been sung. Declaring victory, Ambikapathy sings of his love for her and thus fails the test. He is executed by the king.
Reception.
The film was released on 11 December 1937 and was a big box office success. It ran for 52 weeks. Dungan's love scenes, Bhagavathar's singing and Elangovan's dialogue made the film a talked after success. After "Chintamani", this was the second hit film for Bhagavathar in 1937 and made him the "first superstar of Tamil cinema".

Ben Reyes

Ben Torres Reyes (born February 16, 1947), an American, is a former member of the Texas House of Representatives and a former Houston City Council member.
History.
Ben T. Reyes, a Mexican American, was born February 16, 1947 in Burton, Texas. A resident of the Denver Harbor area of Houston, Reyes, whose father was a laborer, was a member of a family of ten people. He served in the Marine Corps from 1966 through 1969 for a three year span, and he served one tour of duty in the Vietnam War. He later became an activist and a politician.
The La Raza Unida asked Reyes to run for political office while as a member of that political party. Reyes instead ran for office as a Democrat. In 1972 Reyes was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. Representing District 89 as a member of the Democratic Party of the United States, he won re-election three times. In 1976 he received over 96% of the vote. While in the house he served as the vice chairman of the Liquor Regulation Committee and as the chairperson of the Rules committee. Reyes served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1973 to 1979. In 1977 he attended both Texas Southern University and the University of Houston.
In 1979 he was elected to the Houston City Council. He served in District I for 16 years; he left due to term limits. As a city council member he arranged the demolitions of various houses that housed criminal activities. His final year of service was 1995. In 1999 Tim Fleck of the "Houston Press" said that he "virtually created Hispanic politics in Houston and held his own on City Council as perhaps the best wheeler-dealer for nearly two decades."
In a 1991 "Houston Chronicle" article, Richard Murray, a political scientist from the University of Houston, said "Ben was not only a young Turk, but he was an angry Turk. But Ben has had a 20-year career and, like many people, he is a different person now than when he was first elected."
In 1992 he ran for United States Congress in the newly created 29th District, a 63 percent Hispanic-majority district located in eastern Houston. He was initially the favorite, but only won 34 percent of the vote in the five-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. He was forced into a runoff with State Senator Gene Green (with whom he had served in the Texas House), which he lost by only 180 votes out of 130,000 cast. He challenged Green in the 1994 primary, losing by a somewhat wider margin.
A Federal Bureau of Investigation sting revealed issues with Reyes. In May 1991 a grand jury from Harris County indicted Reyes for felony charges, including illegally accepting corporate campaign contributions (taking $51,000 United States dollars to influence votes for a project for a convention center hotel), not using the proper authority while ordering demolition of structures accused of being "crack houses," and stealing a magnolia tree.
In October 1995 undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents gave Reyes a briefcase with cash in exchange for his engineering of votes so that a city contract would be awarded for a convention center hotel. In 1996 he was placed into custody, accused of committing bribery and conspiracy. He was convicted on December 14, 1998, and he went to federal prison for a nine year term in March 1999. Ben Reyes entered the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) system. He was originally incarcerated within the Federal Correctional Complex, Beaumont. He requested a transfer to Federal Correctional Institution, Jesup and was granted his transfer. Reyes said that FCI Jesup was "a more relaxed, more bucolic facility" than the Beaumont facility was. While in the minimum security Georgia prison, Reyes worked as a janitor. Reyes, along with other inmates, submitted a petition to outgoing President of the United States Bill Clinton asking for a pardon. In June 2006 he was released to an East End halfway house. In December 2006 he was released from the halfway house and put on probation. While in the BOP system Reyes had the register number 76205-079. December 29, 2006 was his release date.
A woman Reyes described as a "significant other" picked up Reyes from the halfway house. The probation terms stated that Reyes cannot campaign, run for office, or serve on any boards. He was released from probation in December 2009. Reyes lives in Spring Branch with his wife, Rosalie Brockman; she was his longtime girlfriend before they married in 2008. As of 2009 Reyes works as a construction supervisor.
Legacy.
The Houston Public Library maintains the Ben T. Reyes Collection at the Houston Metropolitan Research Center. The collection has material spanning from 1970 through 1988. All of the material from the beginning of box one through folder twelve of box eight has material regarding his service in the Texas House of Representatives. The rest of the collection concerns his Houston City Council service.
In 1999 Tim Fleck of the "Houston Press" ranked Reyes as the "Best and Worst Councilman at the Same Time." Fleck explained that while Reyes had been convicted of corrupt acts, he had also made political contributions to the city. Fleck added that Reyes, who falsely said that he received the Purple Heart, "had the worst midlife crisis in Houston political history." Fleck said "When Ben was good, he was very good, but when he was bad, he stank out the house."

Saguenay Graben

The Saguenay Graben is a rift valley or graben in the geological Grenville Province of southern Quebec, Canada. It is an elongated flat-bottomed basin long and wide, bounded by normal faults running parallel to its length.
Formation of the Saguenay Graben.
The time of formation of the faults related to the Saugenay Graben is still under debate because it is difficult to accurately measure the age of faulting. Evidence suggests it was either the opening of the Iapetus Ocean (600-400 Ma), or the opening of the Atlantic Ocean (195-170 Ma) that caused the faulting. During the opening of one of these oceans, fragmentation of the landmass occurred creating two fault planes, one to the north and one to the south. The resulting bedrock between dropped down along the normal faults, creating the Saguenay Graben. The extent of these faults are only known at the surface and therefore their extension and shape at depth is unknown.
The faults associated with the Saguenay Graben have been the source for earthquakes, including the 1988 Saguenay earthquake.
Glaciations.
The area was covered by ice sheets several times throughout the Pleistocene. The graben was located relatively parallel to the ice sheet movement and therefore caused it to become a preferred travel pathway for ice. The glaciers cut into the graben and widened it in some places as well as making it considerable deeper in others. After the retreat of the final ice sheet, there was considerable isostatic rebound. The total amount of rebound varied from 140 m on the north side and 120 m on the south side.
Present day geography.
The lowlands within the graben have an altitude of between 100 and 200 m. To the east there is the Kenogami threshold which is characterized by having an altitude of 200 to 260 m. This threshold splits the graben into two physiographic regions; the Lac Saint-Jean region to the west and the Saguenay region to the east. The plateau around the Graben is between 200 and 800 m in altitude. 
The Saguenay River as well as the Lac Saint-Jean are both contained within the Saguenay Graben.
Local geology.
The Saguenay Graben is in the Grenville Province and is characterized primarily by the rock types: gneiss, anorthosite and granite that are Proterozoic in age. There are two outliers of limestone and shale of the Paleozoic that are found only in the graben due to its faulting.

Eaton Harbors Corporation

The Eaton Harbors Corporation (EHC) is a New York business corporation created in 1927 by the heirs of Cornelius H. DeLamater to hold title to and maintain approximately of private roads and beaches located in Eatons Neck, New York. The EHC was formed due to the break-up of the vast Delamater Estate that at one time occupied over on the North Shore of Long Island on the Eatons Neck and Asharoken peninsula.
Background.
The corporation was created on September 14, 1927 by the heirs of Cornelius H. DeLamater who at the time still collectively owned approximately of land in Eatons Neck and Asharoken. Mr. DeLamater was owner of the Delamater Iron Works in New York City. The iron works was responsible for constructing the turret and machinery of the Union Ironclad Monitor during the Civil War. Delamater created a vast estate on Eaton's Neck beginning in 1862, and the Eaton Harbors Corporation was created when the estate was subdivided for sale. The DeLamater Mansion still stands today as a landmark home in the community. 
The EHC is a not-for-profit association supported by legal covenants upon property deeds. About 30% of EHC property owners live in the Village of Asharoken while the other 70% are located within the Town of Huntington.". A total of 1,174 shares of stock are assigned to 170 parcels of property ranging in size from 1 to 5 acres. An annual assessment is levied upon the shareholders of the EHC to support roads and beaches. Shares remain with the land, and cannot be purchased, sold, or refused. Unpaid assessments automatically become a lien upon the land as per the restrictive covenant. 
The EHC maintains a public website for the benefit of shareholders in the Corporation." 
Noted architect Harry E. Donnell, who was married to a grand-daughter of Cornelius DeLamater, served as President of the Eaton Harbors Corporation from 1927 to 1950." The corporation's current president is Joseph DeRosa.

A Tomb for Boris Davidovich

A Tomb for Boris Davidovich (Serbo-Croatian: "Grobnica za Borisa Davidoviča / Гробница за Бориса Давидовича") is a collection of seven short stories by Danilo Kiš written in 1976 (translated into English by Duska Mikic-Mitchell in 1978). The stories are based on historical events and deal with themes of political deception, betrayal, and murder in Eastern Europe during the first half of the 20th century (except for "Dogs and Books" which takes place in 14th century France). Several of the stories are written as fictional biographies wherein the main characters interact with historical figures. The Dalkey Archive Press edition includes an introduction by Joseph Brodsky and an afterword by William T. Vollman. Harold Bloom includes "A Tomb for Boris Davidovich" in his list of canonical works of the period he names the Chaotic Age (1900–present) in "The Western Canon".
The book was featured in Penguin's series "Writers from the Other Europe" from the 1970s. Philip Roth was the general editor, and the series included authors such as Tadeusz Borowski, Bruno Schulz, Jiří Weil, and Milan Kundera among others.
Plagiarism controversy.
The book was subject of long and tedious plagiarism controversy, one of the most famous literary scandals in Tito's Yugoslavia. The controversy, as later revealed, was orchestrated by Dragan M. Jeremić, Communist literary critic, who accused Kiš of "plagiarizing" travelogues, memoirs and history books about Soviet Union. Jeremić motivation was to stir a controversy, disqualifying "A Tomb for Boris Davidovich" from winning a national literary prize. Jeremić successfully secured the prize for himself, but received in exchange a powerful reply from Kiš, in the book "The Anatomy Lesson", in 1978. The book was one of the best works of Yugoslav literary theory. Kiš demonstrated that his critics were completely ignorant of standard literary methods and that their criticism was motivated mainly by personal interests of Jeremić and his cronies. Jeremić was criticized by other contemporary Yugoslav writers and critics, especially after Jeremić supporters accused Kiš of not being "national" writer, because he was of Jewish origin.

Verlag für Geowissenschaften Berlin

Verlag für Geowissenschaften Berlin is a German scientific publisher of titles relating to the geological sciences, founded in 1998. It was originally established as a publishing arm associated with a learned society devoted to the history and historiography of geological research, the Verein Berlin-Brandenburgische Geologie-Historiker "Leopold von Buch" (in English, "Society of Berlin-Brandenburger Geologist-Historians", named after Leopold von Buch, the famous 19th-century Prussian geologist and paleontologist) co-founded the same year by the noted historian of natural sciences at Rostock University, Martin Guntau. The publisher's offices were initially based in the borough of Pankow, East Berlin, later relocating to Ahrensfelde in the adjoining "Landkreis" (district) of Barnim in the German state of Brandenburg. The publisher and director since its founding is Ulrich Wutzke.
The Verlag für Geowissenschaften began as the publisher of the society's new journal, "Geohistorische Blätter", a half-yearly periodical containing original research papers and notices concerning the history of geology in the Berlin-Brandenburg region of Germany and beyond.
At the beginning of 2005, the Verlag für Geowissenschaften took over the publishing rights for the journal "Zeitschrift für Geologische Wissenschaften" from its previous publisher Akademie Verlag, a former East German scientific publishing house. Since its foundation in 1973, this journal had been a leading geological sciences publication and an official research periodical issued by the East German national geological society, the Gesellschaft für Geologische Wissenschaften. After the German reunification this society eventually merged with its West German counterpart to form the Deutschen Geologischen Gesellschaft. The society's association with the "Zeitschrift für Geologische Wissenschaften" formally ceased at the end of 2004 following a decision by the publication rights holder, Akademie Verlag's parent company Wiley-VCH.
In addition to journal publications Verlag für Geowissenschaften issues other monographic titles and conference proceedings in a range of subjects associated with geology.

Palacio Real de Olite

The Palacio de los Reyes de Navarra de Olite ("Palace of the Kings of Navarre of Olite") or Castillo de Olite ("Castle of Olite") was built during the 13th and 14th centuries in the town of Olite. It was one of the seats of the Court of the Kingdom of Navarre, since the reign of Charles III "the Noble".
It was Charles III of Navarre, who in the 15th century began the extension of the former castle, leading to the Palace of the Kings of Navarre. Although almost everyone calls it a "castle", the structure is actually a "palace", as it is a building of courtly character, where the residential aspects prevailed over the military (defense).
One of its main attractions is the apparent disorder of its design. This is because the palace's design did not come from an overall plan, but was the result of ongoing expansions and changes over the course of centuries, although most of the palace was built during the late 14th century and early 15th century. The then King of Navarre, Charles III "The Noble", decided to convert the existing palace into a permanent royal seat and give it its own ornaments.
The design consists of its rooms, gardens and moats, surrounded by high walls and topped by numerous towers, giving it a spectacular and magical figure. In its time, the palace came to be regarded as one of the most beautiful in Europe. One can clearly differentiate two areas: the Old Palace, (now a Parador Nacional de Turismo), and the New Palace. After the invasion of Navarre in 1512 by the then unified Crown of Castile and Aragon, the palace began to deteriorate, as it was only used by the viceroys as residence sporadically. The state of abandonment which the palace was subjected to caused its progressive deterioration. This process culminated when it was burned by the guerrilla Espoz y Mina during the Peninsular War (1813), fearing that it was fortified for the French troops of Napoleon.

Jim Viox

James Harry "Jim" Viox (December 30, 1890 – January 6, 1969) was a professional baseball player who played for five seasons in the National League from 1912 to 1916, all of them with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played second base for much of his career, and played in the middle infield with Honus Wagner during the latter's final seasons.
Viox made his major league debut on May 9, 1912. In 33 games that season, he hit .186 while spending time in the field at third base and shortstop. The following season, in 1913, Viox became the team's regular second baseman, replacing Alex McCarthy at that position. In his first full season, he hit .317, setting a rookie record for batting average by a second basemen that was not matched until 2007 when Dustin Pedroia also hit .317. During the season, Viox finished in the top 10 in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, runs scored, doubles, and sacrifice hits.
His batting average fell over the next two seasons, to .265 in 1914 and .256 in 1915. He showed a good batting eye during those seasons, however, as in both years he was ranked among the top 10 in walks. In his final season in the major leagues, he played in only 43 games and batted .250; his time with the Pirates ended when the club made major changes to its roster.
After his playing days were over, he managed for a time in the minor leagues. During this time, he won two Virginia League championships in 1920 and 1921 while managing Portsmouth.
Viox died on January 6, 1969 in Erlanger, Kentucky.

The 5-11 Campaign is a single-issue, grassroots campaign which seeks to repeal the federal Real ID Act of 2005 and stop implementation of the Real ID Act in the United States. The campaign was founded on May 11, 2008, the date of enactment of the Real ID Act of 2005. The campaign works mainly through legislation submissions, grassroots activism, and grassroots community education.
Background.
The 5-11 Campaign began as a conversation at Brave New Books between Harlan Dietrich, the store's owner and literacy activist, and Sheila Dean, anti-Real ID activist and blogger. The idea for the campaign came about by contrasting 9-11, the culturally-ingrained term for the World Trade Center disaster, with May 11, 2008 (5-11), the enactment date of the Real ID Act of 2005. The date 5-11 was seen as of critical importance, as every American’s citizenship is now in question.
Positions.
The 5-11 Campaign opposes the Real ID for reasons involving privacy, identity security, Constitutional sovereignty, the ineffective and wasteful nature of the bill, national security, and other reasons listed below.
Privacy.
The Real ID's RFID technology allows the ability for tracking, profiling and identity theft, and Real ID "will inevitably expand to facilitate a wide range of surveillance activities." Real ID will be a powerful continuance of the ever-growing surveillance society, already seen in the U.S. in the form of increased video surveillance, data surveillance, and government databases. While Real ID does not yet have a biometrics components, such as fingerprint and iris scans, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expressed that in time it will inevitably be a part of the Real ID program.
Identity security.
The Real ID poses the threat of increased identity fraud. The machine-readable strip on each Real ID will contain unprotected personal information. The private sector and anyone with a barcode reader will have access to the cardholders personal data, which will expose the cardholder to tracking, profiling, and identity theft. 
The Real ID will be vulnerable to insider and outsider fraud because The Real ID Act requires States to connect their drivers license data to the data of all 55 other states and territories. Thousands of false driver's licenses are already being issued by bribed state employees, and the Federal Government has exposed the personal information of as many as 40 million Americans to potential theft. The Real ID database will certainly be a target for identity thieves.
Passage of the Act.
The 5-11 Campaign opposes the way that the Real ID Act was passed. While the official DHS site claims Congress responded to a recommendation from the 8/11 Commission Report by passing the Real ID Act, The Real ID Act of 2005 was previously rejected as a stand alone bill and was then inserted into a bundled legislation bill HR1268, titled Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005. The 5-11 Campaign opposes the covert passage of the Real ID Act, as it was slipped into a bundle of unrelated legislation involving emotionally-based issues of tsunami relief and increased funding for increased body armor for U.S. troops.
4th Amendment.
With personal and biometric information stored in an international database, the security of a person's information is at great risk, and the probability of identification theft is great. The demand of citizenship identity documents without criminal cause is an extreme escalation of government seizures.
10th Amendment.
"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
The Real ID, as written today, can be used for “any official purpose” the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security deems appropriate. The 5-11 Campaign does not trust the federal government with this kind of unrestrained, undefined authority. The federal government is violating the 10th amendment by attempting to force the states to comply with Real ID. DHS mandates Real IDs be used for "accessing a Federal facility; boarding Federally-regulated commercial aircraft; and entering nuclear power plants," then adds, "DHS may consider expanding these official purposes through future rulemakings to maximize the security benefits of REAL ID." The Real ID will inevitably expand into a "de facto" National ID card and an internal passport, "used to track and control individuals movements and activities."
Inefficiencies of the Real ID and government waste.
States’ taxpayers will pay billions to comply with the Real ID Act of 2005, an unfunded federal mandate. The REAL ID application process will require that everyone apply and renew cards in person, leading to long lines of angry constituents. There is also concern that many groups of people, survivors of domestic violence and military personnel will not be able to produce the required documents to apply for a Real ID compliant license.
National security.
The 5-11 Campaign believes that the security provisions determined by the Real ID Act, as currently written, are not only counterproductive but may in the future actually make the continental U.S. more vulnerable to malintent due to mandatory identity document storage in insecure database networks. The Campaign also believes that retention of a person's identity articles as they travel to and from the U.S. is excessive and does not serve the safety and security of America's citizens. They do not recognize preemptive crimes as a reason for legal search and seizure. NOTE: The 5-11 Campaign has no other security position other than what pertains to the Real ID Act.
The 5-11 Campaign also opposes the lack of state or public oversight of actions taken by elected or appointed officials on the matter of citizen identity use, storage and dissemination. Matters of identity are personal. There must be always be oversight and public input on how a U.S. citizen's personal information is being managed. The 5-11 campaign recognizes that participation in the Real ID is voluntary and those who are opposed to Real ID should not volunteer information for obtaining a Real ID.
Transportation and travel.
The 5-11 Campaign feels there would be a duplication of efforts in the Real ID's stipulations that citizens use a Real ID as an internal passport for U.S. continental travel. A passport is sufficient to leave the continental U.S. and territories to enter another country. 
The demand of citizenship identity documents without criminal cause is in violation of the 4th Amendment, which protects Americans from illegal search and seizures. The 5-11 Campaigners actively express their opposition to the use of Real IDs by presenting a passport when they fly, enter federal buildings and or circumstances where a Real ID card would be required by law.
Real ID and immigration.
Organizations on both sides of the immigration issue have found fault with Real ID's immigration policy. No strategy introduced by the Real ID Act has been found to create relevant changes in illegal human trafficking, pecuniary employment of undocumented aliens, or their establishing residence in the U.S.
Identity technologies.
The 5-11 Campaign opposes the use of RFID chips in identity documents because of their poor performance in identity security. They have failed in the U.S. Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program at the border, where the technology's read rates proved inadequate.
The 5-11 Campaign opposes the sharing of personal information and biometrics data internationally, as DHS's Robert Mocny proposed in the US-VISIT program. Global information sharing of biometrics data is a major threat to identity security. Not only would we have to trust our records with the AAMVA employees of the United States, but we would also be asked to trust the information technology systems and employees of other countries with whom we link our databases

Trans-spanning ligand

Trans-spanning ligands are bidentate ligands that can span opposite sites of a complex with square-planar geometry. A wide variety of ligands that chelate in the cis fashion already exist, but very few can link opposite vertices on a coordination polyhedron. Early attempts to generate trans-spanning bidentate ligands relied on polymethylene chains to link the donor functionalities, but such ligands often lead to coordination polymers. 
History.
A diphosphane linked with pentamethylene was claimed to span across a square planar complex. This early attempt was followed by ligands with more rigid backbones. "TRANSPHOS" was the first trans-spanning diphosphane ligand that usually coordinates to palladium(II) and platinum(II) in a trans manner. TRANSPHOS features benzophenanthrene substituted by diphenylphosphinomethyl (Ph2PCH2) groups at the 1 and 11 positions. The polycyclic framework suffers sterically clashing hydrogen centers.
Xantphos, SPANphos, TRANSDIP and related ligands.
Xantphos is a trans-spanning ligand, without the steric problems associated with TRANSPHOS. SPANphos is comparable to XANTPHOS but more reliably trans-spanning. TRANSDIP, based on a α-cyclodextrin, is the first ligand to give exclusively trans-spanned complexes, even with d8 metal ion halides.

Reiyūkai

, or Reiyūkai Shakaden is an organization founded in 1920 by Kakutarō Kubo and Kimi Kotani. It is a lay organization—meaning that there are no priests—associated with Nichiren Buddhism. Reiyūkai considers itself the grandfather of lay-based new religions devoted to the Lotus Sutra and ancestor veneration.
"Shakaden" in the name Reiyūkai Shakaden means that this organization lays extra emphasis on the veneration of Shakyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism.
A further offshoot from Reiyūkai, in 1938, is Risshō Kōsei Kai.
The reiyūkai has a representative in the religious far-right party Nippon Kaigi. Former Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara is a believer and writes in reiyūkai publications.

Sand Point Light

The Sand Point Lighthouse is located in Escanaba, Michigan, United States, on Lake Michigan's northern shore. Since 1989, it has been an unofficial aid to navigation. Though it is an operational aid to navigation. The restored lighthouse is now open to the public during the summer months. It is also known as the Escanaba/Sand Point (Little Bay de Noc) Light or the Escanaba Light.
This Sand Point Light is one of two bearing that name in Michigan. The other is in Baraga.
History.
Soon after it became a town in 1863, Escanaba was quickly growing as an important shipping port. The Peninsula Railroad was completed in 1864, which linked Escanaba to the iron mines of the Upper Peninsula to the north. Iron ore docks were built in the Escanaba harbor and the shipping of iron ore to steel mills along the Great Lakes became Escanaba's leading industry.
As shipping traffic increased dramatically, so did the need for some sort of light structure to guide the ships in and out of the harbor and to warn them of the treacherous sand shoals that reached out into Little Bay de Noc from "Sand Point", a sandspit located just south of and adjacent to the harbor area. The United States Lighthouse Service approved construction of the Sand Point Lighthouse at a cost of $11,000. Construction began in the fall of 1867 and was completed in early spring 1868. The light first shone on the night of May 13, 1868.
The Sand Point Lighthouse is a story-and-a-half rectangular building with an attached brick tower. The tower is topped with a cast iron lantern room which houses a fourth order Fresnel lens, emitting a fixed red light with a radiating power of . A unique distinction concerning the Sand Point Lighthouse is that it was constructed with its tower facing the land instead of facing the water. Whether this orientation was intentional or an engineering blunder is unknown.
John Terry was appointed the first lighthouse keeper of the new lighthouse in December 1867, but he became very ill and died in April 1868 a month before the lighthouse was ready to be manned. With the lighthouse nearly completed but with no lightkeeper ready to report to duty, John Terry's wife, Mary, was appointed lightkeeper and subsequently became one of the first female lightkeepers on the Great Lakes. Mary Terry was a well-respected citizen in the community and fulfilled her duties as lightkeeper with efficiency and dedication. She was lightkeeper from 1868 to 1886, when a mysterious fire severely damaged the lighthouse and took her life. To date, no one knows exactly what happened or why it happened. Some speculate that it was an attempted burglary and that the suspect set the lighthouse afire to cover any evidence of wrongdoing. The south entrance door showed signs of forced entry, yet none of Mary Terry's valuables were taken. With the lighthouse badly damaged, restoration took nearly two full months and a new lightkeeper, Lewis Rose, was appointed to take over.
Over the years a number of changes took place at the Sand Point Lighthouse. Perhaps the most significant was when the lighthouse was hooked up to the city's electric supply in 1913. This meant that the kerosene lamp was removed from within the lens and replaced with an incandescent light bulb.
The Coast Guard years.
A total of nine lightkeepers and their families lived in the Sand Point Lighthouse from its inception in 1868 to its deactivation in 1939. It was in this year that the United States Coast Guard took over all navigational lights in the country from the National Lighthouse Service. The Coast Guard constructed an automated crib light several hundred feet offshore, which replaced the function and duties of the Sand Point Lighthouse and its lightkeeper. The automated crib light is still in use today and can be seen from the tower of the Sand Point Lighthouse.
The Sand Point Lighthouse was no longer operational, but it continued to serve as housing for Coast Guard seaman who were assigned to duty in Escanaba. Upon using the lighthouse as their residence, the Coast Guard made many changes to the structure. The lantern room was removed and the tower was lowered by ten feet. In addition, the roof was raised to create a full second floor, several windows were added and the entire building was covered in aluminum siding. With these changes, the Sand Point Lighthouse was barely recognizable.
Restoration.
After a dedication ceremony in July 1990, the newly restored Sand Point lighthouse was opened to the public. Each year the lighthouse is open from Memorial Day to October 1, giving visitors a chance to climb the tower and witness what it would have been like to be a lightkeeper around the turn of the 20th century. An admission fee is charged.
The light is listed on the National Register of Historical Places, Reference #97001474.
Name of Listing: Sand Point Lighthouse. It is also on the state inventory list, beginning in 1989.
Getting there.
Off season tours may be arranged through the Sand Point Lighthouse, 16 Water Plant Rd, Escanaba, MI 49829, or call (906) 786-6790.

John Scarlett Davis

John Scarlett Davis (1 September 1804 – 29 September 1845), or Davies, was an English landscape, portrait and architectural painter, and lithographer.
Life and work.
Davis was born in Leominster, the son of James Davis, a watchmaker; Scarlett was his mother's maiden name. At the age of eleven, Davis won an award from the local society for the encouragement of the arts. He studied at the Royal Academy Schools in London, and began exhibiting his works at the annual Royal Academy shows in 1825 (with the painting "My Den"). He last exhibited in London in 1844. He was influenced by the work of his contemporary, Richard Parkes Bonington.
Davis painted portraits, landscapes, and church interiors, and developed a distinctive specialty in painting the interiors of art galleries. His picture "The Interior of the British Institution Gallery" (1829) records a collection of Old Masters. He lithographed and published twelve heads from studies by Rubens, and in 1832 some views of Bolton Abbey, drawn from nature on stone. His watercolor of the collection of Benjamin Godfrey Windus (1835) shows the Turner pictures on the walls. (John Ruskin studied those Turners while writing his "Modern Painters".) Davis painted the interiors of the Louvre as well. Between 1842 and 1845 he was commissioned to draw copies of the paintings in the collections of the British royal palaces.
Davis painted scenes on the Continent during his travels there. In 1831 he had a commission from Lord Farnborough to paint an interior of the Vatican and of the Escurial. He was in Florence in 1834, where he painted the interior of the Uffizi Gallery, and in Amsterdam in 1841 (sending the picture "Jack after a successful cruise, visiting his old comrades at Greenwich").
Davis's later years were marred by alcoholism and spells of imprisonment. His posthumous reputation suffered as a result. He died in 1835, aged just 41 years.
Davis's name is almost identical to that of John Scarlett-Davies, a modern video artist and director.
