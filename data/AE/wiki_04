Asymmetric hydrogenation

Asymmetric hydrogenation is a chemical reaction that adds two atoms of hydrogen to a target (substrate) molecule with three-dimensional spatial selectivity. Critically, this selectivity does not come from the target molecule itself, but from other reagents or catalysts present in the reaction. This allows spatial information (what chemists refer to as chirality) to transfer from one molecule to the target, forming the product as a single enantiomer. The chiral information is most commonly contained in a catalyst and, in this case, the information in a single molecule of catalyst may be transferred to many substrate molecules, amplifying the amount of chiral information present. Similar processes occur in nature, where a chiral molecule like an enzyme can catalyse the introduction of a chiral centre to give a product as a single enantiomer, such as amino acids, that a cell needs to function. By imitating this process, chemists can generate many novel synthetic molecules that interact with biological systems in specific ways, leading to new pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. The importance of asymmetric hydrogenation in both academia and industry contributed to two of its pioneers — William Standish Knowles and Ryōji Noyori — being awarded one half of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
History.
The history of asymmetric hydrogenation goes back to the early 1956 when a heterogeneous catalyst made of palladium deposited on silk was first used to successfully produce chiral hydrogenation products where one enantiomer was present in greater quantity than the other. Later, in 1968, the groups of William Knowles and Leopold Horner independently published the first example of asymmetric hydrogenation using a homogeneous rhodium catalyst. While the enantiomeric excess, a quantity used to measure how much of one enantiomer is produced relative to the other, was low for both of these reactions, they were important demonstrations that asymmetric hydrogenation was possible and would encourage the rapid growth of the field. By 1972, an enantiomeric excess of 90% was possible and the first industrial synthesis using this technology, that of the Parkinson’s drug L-DOPA, commenced.
The field of asymmetric hydrogenation continued to experience a number of notable advances. Henri Kagan developed DIOP, a new type of chiral ligand (C2 symmetric ligands) that allowed chiral information to be transferred to substrates much more effectively. Ryōji Noyori introduced the use of ruthenium-based catalysts that could be used to asymmetrically hydrogenate several important types of substrates. The introduction of P,N ligands then further expanded the scope of asymmetric hydrogenation and demonstrated that the C2 symmetric ligands, while highly effective, are not fundamentally superior to chiral ligands lacking rotational symmetry. Today, a large array of molecular architectures can be successfully modified by asymmetric hydrogenation. Homogeneous catalysts are certainly the most common and well developed type of catalyst used to achieve these reactions. However, researchers have begun to revisit heterogeneous catalysts and there, too, advances have been made.
Mechanism.
Two major mechanisms have been proposed to date for catalytic hydrogenation with rhodium complexes: the unsaturated mechanism and the dihydride mechanism. While distinguishing between the two mechanisms is difficult, the difference between the two for asymmetric hydrogenation is relatively unimportant since both converge to a common intermediate before any stereochemical information is transferred to the product molecule.
Metals.
Platinum-group metals.
Rhodium was the first metal to be used in a homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation, and has since enjoyed considerable popularity in asymmetric hydrogenation. Targets for asymmetric hydrogenation with rhodium generally require a coordinating group close to the olefin. While this is a significant chemical limitation, many classes of valuable industrial chemicals possess such functionalization and rhodium remains a highly useful metal for the asymmetric hydrogenation of these targets.
The Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation is based on ruthenium. Subsequent work has expanded upon Noyori's original catalyst template, leading to the inclusion of traditionally difficult substrates like "t"-butyl ketones and 1-tetralones as viable substrates for hydrogenation with ruthenium catalysts. Transfer hydrogenation based on the Ru and TsDPEN has also enjoyed commercial success.
The development of iridium catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation complements that of rhodium and ruthenium by targeting a number of "non-traditional" substrates for which good solutions had not been found. Unfunctionalized olefins are the archetypal case, but many other examples including ketones exist. A common difficulty with iridium-based systems is their tendency to trimerize in solution, and catalysts must be designed with a feature that prohibits this pathway. The use of a BArF- anion has so far proven to be the most widely applicable solution; other strategies to enhance catalyst stability include the addition of an additional coordinating arm to the chiral ligand, increasing the steric bulk of the ligand, using a dendrimeric ligand, increasing the rigidity of the ligand, immobilizing the ligand, and using heterobimetallic systems (with iridium as one of the metals).
Base metals.
Iron is a popular research target for many catalytic processes, owing largely to its low cost and low toxicity relative to other transition metals. Asymmetric hydrogenation methods using iron have been realized, although the rates and selectivity of these transformations does not equal those achieved with precious metals. In some cases, structurally ill-defined nanoparticles have proven to be the active species "in situ" and the modest selectivity observed may result from their uncontrolled geometries.
Ligand classes.
Phosphine ligands.
Chiral phosphine ligands are the source of chirality in most asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts. Of these the BINAP ligand is perhaps the best-known, as a result of its Nobel Prize-winning application in the Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation.
Chiral phosphine ligands can be generally classified as mono- or bidentate. They can be further classified into those where the stereogenic centre is phosphorus or resides on the organic substituents. Ligands with a C2 symmetry element have been particularly popular, in part because the presence of such an element reduces the possible binding conformations of a substrate to a metal-ligand complex dramatically (often resulting in exceptional enantioselectivity).
Monophosphine-type ligands were among the first to appear in asymmetric hydrogenation, with the ligand CAMP being involved in the first highly effective asymmetric hydrogenation. Continued research into these types of ligands has explored both P-alkyl and P-heteroatom bonded ligands, with P-heteroatom ligands like the phosphites and phosphoramidites generally achieving more impressive results. Structural classes of ligands that have been successful include those based on the binapthyl structure of MonoPHOS or the spiro ring system of SiPHOS. Notably, these monodentate ligands can be used in combination with each other to achieve a synergistic improvement in enantioselectivity; something that is not possible with the diphosphine ligands.
The diphosphine-type ligands have received considerably more attention than the monophosphines and, perhaps as a consequence, have a much longer list of achievement. This class includes the first ligand to achieve high chiral selectivity (DIOP), the first ligand to be used in industrial asymmetric synthesis (DIPAMP) and what is likely the best known chiral ligand (BINAP). Their use in asymmetric hydrogenation is essentially ubiquitous and it is perhaps more common to find a highly effective asymmetric hydrogenation that uses a chiral diphosphine based system than it is to find one using an alternate ligand.
P,N and P,O ligands.
The use of P,N ligands in asymmetric hydrogenation can be traced to the C2 symmetric bisoxazoline ligand. However, these symmetric ligands were soon superseded by mono(oxazoline) ligands whose lack of C2 symmetry has in no way limited their efficacy as ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Such ligands generally consist of an achiral nitrogen-containing heterocycle that is functionalized with a pendant phosphorus-containing arm, although both the exact nature of the heterocycle and the chemical environment phosphorus center has varied widely. No one structure has emerged as consistently effective with a broad range of substrates, although certain privileged structures (like the phosphine-oxazoline or PHOX architecture) have been established. Moreover, within a narrowly defined substrate class the performance of metallic complexes with chiral P,N ligands can closely approach perfect conversion and selectivity in systems otherwise very difficult to target.
The use of P,O ligands with transition metals in asymmetric hydrogenation is quite recent (2011). However, certain organometallic complexes derived from these ligands have shown promising results in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones and esters, with the complex shown displaying consistently high performance.
NHC ligands.
Ligands for asymmetric hydrogenation based on an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) motif have so far generally fallen into one of two categories. The first are C,N ligands that combine an NHC with a chiral oxazoline to create a chiral chelating ligand, while the second are chiral, C2 symmetric NHCs.
NHC-based ligands of the first type have been generated as large libraries from the reaction of smaller libraries of individual NHCs and oxazolines. The most effective catalyst of this type comes from the Burgess group, and featuring a bulky seven-membered metallocycle formed between the ligand and iridium. This complex has been applied to the catalytic hydrogenation of a number of unfunctionalized olefins and vinyl ether alcohols with conversions and ee's frequently in the high 80s or 90s. It has also been applied to the synthesis of a number of aldol, vicinal dimethyl and deoxypolyketide motifs, and to the deoxypolyketides themselves.
The second type of NHC ligands, C2 symmetric NHCs, have come to light quite recently but have shown themselves to be highly useful ligands for the asymmetric hydrogenation of traditionally difficult substrates like thiophenes (see below).
Linear substrates.
The asymmetric hydrogenation of linear unsaturated molecules like olefins, ketones, enamines and imines represents the oldest and most-developed fields of research in asymmetric hydrogenation as a whole, and may be grouped together as "classic" substrates. Effective methods for these compounds often invoke a bidentate substrate binding mode, in which the target unsaturated group and a second, adjacent functionality bind the metal to form a precisely oriented chelate (which can then selectively receive hydrogen). Difficulties can arise, however, when this second (proximal, functional) group is not present. Unfunctionalized olefins and enamines are good examples of this, and have been the focus of modern research. Another difficulty can arise when substrates bind in an end-on, η1, fashion instead of in an η2 mode from the pi-face. This change removes the hydrogen-accepting carbon from the immediate binding environment about the metal, and has been presumed to make hydrogenation of compounds like imines and ketones more difficult.
Unfunctionalized olefins and enamines.
The asymmetric hydrogenations of functionalized olefins and enamines have traditionally been related because an enamide, (one of the most popular functionalized enamine targets) can be viewed much like a β-keto olefin (one of the most easily asymmetrically hydrogenated olefinic targets). The more challenging, unfunctionalized targets continue to share some effective systems, but have largely diverged in terms of favoured ligand types.
For unfunctionalized olefins, iridium metal sources (in conjunction with P,N-based ligands) form the dominant asymmetric hydrogenation systems. Catalyst utility within this category is unusually narrow; consequently, many different categories of solved and unsolved catalytic problems have developed. 1,1-disubstituted, 1,2-diaryl trisubstituted, 1,1,2-trialkyl and tetrasubstituted olefins represent classes that have been investigated separately, and even within these classes variations may exist that make different solutions optimal.
Conversely to the case of olefins, asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines has favoured diphosphine-type ligands; excellent results have been achieved with both iridium- and rhodium-based systems. However, even the best systems often suffer from either less-than-optimal enantioselectivity, a lack of generality or a combination of the two. Certain pyrrolidine-derived enamines of aromatic ketones may be asymmetrically hydrogenated using a cationic rhodium(I), chiral phosphonite ligand, and I2 and acetic acid system with ee values usually above 90% and potentially as high as 99.9%. A similar system using iridium(I) and a very closely related phosphoramidite ligand was similarly effective for the asymmetric hydrogenation of pyrrolidine-type enamines where the double bond was inside the ring: in other words, of dihydropyrroles. In both cases, the enantioselectivity dropped substantially when the ring size was increased from five to six.
Imines and ketones.
Ketones and imines are very closely related functional groups, and effective technologies for the asymmetric hydrogenation of each are also closely related. Of these, the ruthenium-chiral diphosphine-diamine system first elucidated by Noyori is perhaps one of the best known. It can be employed in conjunction with a wide range of phosphines and amines (where the amine may be, but need not be, chiral) and can be easily adjusted for an optimal match with the target substrate, generally achieving enantiomeric excesses (ee's) above 90%.
Iridium/P,N ligand-based systems are also commonly used for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones and imines. For example, a consistent system for benzylic aryl imines uses the P,N ligand SIPHOX in conjunction with iridium(I) in a cationic complex to achieve asymmetric hydrogenation with ee >90%. One of the most efficient and effective catalysts ever developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones, with a turnover number (TON) up to 4,550,000 and ee up to 99.9%, uses another iridium(I) system with a closely related tridentate ligand.
Despite their similarities, the two functional groups are not identical; there are many areas where they diverge significantly. One of these is in the asymmetric hydrogenation of N-unfunctionalized imines to give primary amines. Such species can be difficult to selectively reduce because they tend to exist in complex equilibria of imine and enamine tautomers, as well as (E) and (Z) isomers. One approach to this problem has been to use ketimines as their hydrochloride salt and rely on the steric properties of the adjacent alkyl or aryl groups to allow the catalyst to differentiate between the two enantiotopic faces of the ketimine.
Aromatic substrates.
The asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic (especially heteroaromatic), substrates is a very active field of ongoing research. Catalysts in this field must contend with a number of complicating factors, including the tendency of highly stable aromatic compounds to resist hydrogenation, the potential coordinating (and therefore catalyst-poisoning) abilities of both substrate and product, and the great diversity in substitution patterns that may be present on any one aromatic ring. Of these substrates the most consistent success has been seen with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, where the aromatic ring is often activated either by protonation or by further functionalization of the nitrogen (generally with an electron-withdrawing protecting group). Such strategies are less applicable to oxygen- and sulfur-containing heterocycles, since they are both less basic and less nucleophilic; this additional difficulty may help to explain why few effective methods exist for their asymmetric hydrogenation.
Quinolines, isoquinolines and quinoxalines.
Two systems exist for the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-substituted quinolines with isolated yields generally greater than 80% and ee values generally greater than 90%. The first is an iridium(I)/chiral phosphine/I2 system, first reported by Zhou "et al". While the first chiral phosphine used in this system was MeOBiPhep, newer iterations have focused on improving the performance of this ligand. To this end, systems use phosphines (or related ligands) with improved air stability, recyclability, ease of preparation, lower catalyst loading and the potential role of achiral phosphine additives. As of October 2012 no mechanism appears to have been proposed, although both the necessity of I2 or a halogen surrogate and the possible role of the heteroaromatic N in assisting reactivity have been documented.
The second is an organocatalytic transfer hydrogenation system based on Hantzsh esters and a chiral Brønsted acid. In this case, the authors envision a mechanism where the isoquinoline is alternately protonated in an activating step, then reduced by conjugate addition of hydride from the Hantzsh ester.
Much of the asymmetric hydrogenation chemistry of quinoxalines is closely related to that of the structurally similar quinolines. Effective (and efficient) results can be obtained with an Ir(I)/phophinite/I2 system and a Hantzsh ester-based organocatalytic system, both of which are similar to the systems discussed earlier with regards to quinolines.
Pyridines.
Pyridines are highly variable substrates for asymmetric reduction (even compared to other heteroaromatics), in that five carbon centers are available for differential substitution on the initial ring. As of October 2012 no method seems to exist that can control all five, although at least one reasonably general method exists.
The most-general method of asymmetric pyridine hydrogenation is actually a heterogeneous method, where asymmetry is generated from a chiral oxazolidinone bound to the C2 position of the pyridine. Hydrogenating such functionalized pyridines over a number of different heterogeneous metal catalysts gave the corresponding piperidine with the substituents at C3, C4, and C5 positions in an all-"cis" geometry, in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. The oxazolidinone auxiliary is also conveniently cleaved under the hydrogenation conditions.
Methods designed specifically for 2-substituted pyridine hydrogenation can involve asymmetric systems developed for related substrates like 2-substituted quinolines and quinoxalines. For example, an iridium(I)\chiral phosphine\I2 system is effective in the asymmetric hydrogenation of activated (alkylated) 2-pyridiniums or certain cyclohexanone-fused pyridines. Similarly, chiral Brønsted acid catalysis with a Hantzsh ester as a hydride source is effective for some 2-alkyl pyridines with additional activating substitution.
Indoles.
The asymmetric hydrogenation of indoles initially focused on N-protected indoles, where the protecting group could serve both to activate the heterocycle to hydrogenation and as a secondary coordination site for the metal. Later work allowed unprotected indoles to be targeted through Brønsted acid activation of the indole.
In the initial report on asymmetric indole hydrogenation, N-acetyl 2-substituted indoles could be protected with high yields and ee of 87-95%. 3-substituted indoles were less successful, with hydrolysis of the protecting group outcompeting the hydrogenation of the indole. Switching to an N-tosyl protecting group inhibited the hydrolysis reaction and allowed both 2- and 3-substituted indoles to be hydrogenated in high yield and ee. The problem with both methods, however, is that N-acetyl and N-tosyl groups require harsh cleavage conditions that might be incompatible with complex substrates. Using an easily cleaved N-Boc group would relieve this problem, and highly effective methods for the asymmetric hydrogenation of such indoles (both 2- and 3-substituted) were soon developed.
Despite these advances in the asymmetric hydrogenation of protected indoles, considerable operational simplicity can be gained by removing the protecting group altogether. This has been achieved with catalytic systems utilizing Brønsted acids to activate the indole. The initial system used a Pd(TFA)2/H8-BINAP system to achieve the enantioselective "cis"-hydrogenation of 2,3- and 2-substituted indoles with high yield and excellent ee. A similar process, where sequential Friedel-Crafts alkylation and asymmetric hydrogenation occur in one pot, allow asymmetric 2,3-substituted indolines to be selectively prepared from 2-substituted indoles in similarly high yields and ee.
A promising organocatalytic method for the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2,3-substituted indoles utilizing a chiral Lewis base also exists, although the observed ee's are not quite equivalent to those of the metal-based hydrogenations.
Pyrroles.
Achieving complete conversion of pyrroles to pyrrolidines by asymmetric hydrogenation has so far proven difficult, with partial-hydrogenation products often being observed. Complete enantioselective reduction is possible, with the outcome depending on both the starting substrate and the method.
The asymmetric hydrogenation of 2,3,5-substituted pyrroles was achieved by the recognition that such substrates bear the same substitution pattern as 2-substituted indoles, and an asymmetric hydrogenation system that is effective for one of these substrates might be effective for both. Such an analysis led to the development of a ruthenium(I)/phosphine/amine base system for 2,3,5-substituted N-Boc pyrroles that can give either dihydro or tetrahydropyrroles (pyrrolidines), depending on the nature of the pyrrole substituents. An all-phenyl substitution pattern leads to dihydropyrroles in very high yield (>96%) and essentially perfect enantioselectivity. Access to the fully hydrogenated, all-"cis" dihydropyrrole may then be accessible through diastereoselective heterogeneous hydrogenation. Alkyl substitution may lead to either the dihydro or tetrahydropyrrole, although the yields (>70%) and enantioselectivities (often >90%) generally remain high. The regioselectivity in both cases appears to be governed by sterics, with the less-substituted double being preferentially hydrogenated.
Unprotected 2,5-pyrroles may also be hydrogenated asymmetrically by a Brønsted acid/Pd(II)/chiral phosphine-catalyzed method, to give the corresponding 2,5-disubstituted 1-pyrrolines in roughly 70-80% yield and 80-90% ee.
Oxygen-containing heterocycles.
The asymmetric hydrogenation of furans and benzofurans has so far proven highly challenging, with many systems reporting only moderately enantionselectivity with various systems. 
Even in the case where good-to-excellent enantioselectivity has been obtained with a chiral P,N phosphinite ligand on a cationic iridium catalyst modeled after Crabtree's catalyst, the tested substrate scope is quite small and its applicability to a general furan architecture is uncertain.
<br>
Sulfur-containing heterocycles.
As is the case with oxygen-containing heterocycles, the asymmetric hydrogenation of compounds where sulfur is part of the initial unsaturated pi-bonding system so far appears to be limited to thiophenes and benzothiophenes. The key approach to the asymmetric hydrogenation of these heterocycles involves a ruthenium(II) catalyst and chiral, C2 symmetric N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). Interestingly, this system appears to possess superb selectivity (ee > 90%) and perfect diasteroselectivity (all "cis") if the substrate has a fused (or directly bound) phenyl ring but yields only racemic product in all other tested cases.
<br>
Heterogeneous Catalysis.
Research into asymmetric hydrogenation with heterogeneous catalysts has generally focused on three areas. The oldest, dating back to the first asymmetric hydrogenation with palladium deposited on a silk support, involves modifying a metal surface with a chiral molecule, usually one that can be harvested from nature. Alternatively, researchers have used various techniques to attempt to immobilize what would otherwise be homogeneous catalysts on heterogeneous supports or have used synthetic organic ligands and metal sources to build chiral metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
The greatest successes in chiral modification of metal surfaces have come from the use of cinchona alkaloids, though numerous other classes of natural products have been evaluated. These alkaloids have been shown to enhance the rate of substrate hydrogenation by 10–100 times, such that less than one molecule of cinchona alkaloid is needed for every reactive site on the metal and, in fact, the presence of too much of the chiral modifier can cause a decrease in the enantioselectivity of the reaction.
An alternative technique and one that allows more control over the structural and electronic properties of active catalytic sites is the immobilization of catalysts that have been developed for homogeneous catalyis on a heterogeneous support. Covalent bonding of the catalyst to a polymer or other solid support is perhaps most common, though immobilization of the catalyst may also be achieved by adsorption onto a surface, ion exchange, or even physical encapsulation. One drawback of this approach is the potential for the proximity of the support to change the behaviour of the catalyst, lowering the enantioselectivity of the reaction. To avoid this, the catalyst is often bound to the support by a long linker though cases are known where the proximity of the support can actually enhance the performance of the catalyst.
The final approach involves the construction of MOFs that incorporate chiral reaction sites from a number of different components, potentially including chiral and achiral organic ligands, structural metal ions, catalytically active metal ions, and/or preassembled catalytically active organometallic cores. This field is relatively new, and few examples exist of chiral asymmetric hydrogenation using these frameworks. One of these was reported in 2003, when a heterogeneous catalyst was reported that included structural zirconium, catalytically active ruthenium, and a BINAP-derived phosphonate as both chiral ligand and structural linker. As little as 0.005 mol% of this catalyst proved sufficient to achieve the asymmetric hydrogenation of aryl ketones, though the usual conditions featured 0.1 mol % of catalyst and resulted in an enantiomeric excess of 90.6–99.2%.
The success of asymmetric hydrogenation in industry can be seen in a number of specific cases where the replacement of kinetic resolution based methods has resulted in substantial improvements in the process's efficiency. For example, Roche's Catalysis Group was able to achieve the synthesis of (S,S)-Ro 67-8867 in 53% overall yield, a dramatic increase above the 3.5% that was achieved in the resolution based synthesis. Roche's synthesis of mibefradil was likewise improved by replacing resolution with asymmetric hydrogenation, reducing the step count by three and increasing the yield of a key intermediate to 80% from the original 70%.

Auchenipterus

Auchenipterus is a genus of driftwood catfishes (order Siluriformes). 
Taxonomy.
The genus is hypothesized to be monophyletic, diagonsed by the shared presence of grooves in the ventral surface of the head that accommodate adducted mental barbels. The presence of papillae on the dorsal and medial surface of the ossified maxillary barbel of mature males is also a possible synapomorphy, but in three species this cannot be confirmed as there are no adult male specimens yet discovered.
This genus contains 11 species:
Distribution.
The neotropical genus "Auchenipterus" is widely distributed in most of the river systems east of the Andean Cordilleras. The species are found through the Orinoco River, Amazon River, and Rio de La Plata basins, and the coastal drainages of the Guianas; one species, "A. menezesi", originates from the Rio Pindark-Mirim and Rio Parnaiba basins of northeastern Brazil. In some regions they are abundant enough to be commercially important.
Description.
"Auchenipterus" species have a number of pronounced sexually dimorphic features of the head, maxillary barbels, and anal fin.

Léon Gallet

Léon L. Gallet (1832–1899), watchmaker, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and past family patriarch of the Gallet Watch Company of Switzerland, is considered as one of the primary architects and founders of the 19th century industrialization of the Swiss watchmaking industry.
The son of Julien Gallet (1806–1849), who moved the family watchmaking business from Geneva, Switzerland, to the manufacturing district of La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1826, Léon L. Gallet was responsible for the creation of numerous Swiss and American watch brands. Among these was the prestigious Fabrique Electa, which became the upscale line of the jewelry department at Macy’s Department store in New York City during the first quarter of the 20th century. Léon L. Gallet also established the brands National Park, Continental Watch Company, Jerome Park, Bridgeport, Eureka, Commodore, Union Square, and Lady Racine. While the appearance and function of many of Gallet’s timepieces were tailored to the tastes of the American consumers, all of the movements in these watches were manufactured in Switzerland.
Léon Gallet played a philanthropic role in the business, cultural, and social life of his native home. As well as his prominent position as a member of both the legislature of Neuchâtel and the Council of La Chaux-de-Fonds, he was for many years, the president of the Société des Amis des Arts (Fine Arts Society) and Grand Master of the Free Masons. Together with Louis & Jules Courvoisier, Ernest Francillon of Longines, and Constant Girard-Perregaux, Léon Gallet founded the Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society for the Industries of the Jura Area) in 1876. The purpose of this organization was to assist in the promotion and distribution of products from Switzerland's Watch Valley while addressing the growing threat of competition in European markets from American watch manufacturers.
Upon his death in 1899, Léon Gallet bequeathed a sum of 43,000 Swiss Francs (today equivalent to 1,000,000 Swiss Francs or approx. 1,000,000 US dollars) to his hometown of La Chaux-de-Fonds, of which 25,000 Swiss Francs were earmarked to build the Musée International d'Horlogerie (International Watch Making Museum). Donated by Léon Gallet’s son Georges, the museum’s collection was started with a body of over 100 of Gallet's most complicated and valuable timepieces, including the world's first wristwatch produced for mass consumption in 1892. The balance of the bequeathed funds was used to construct the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds), designed by renown painter Charles l’Eplattenier and architect René Chapallaz, Le Corbusier's architecture teacher.
Prior to his passing, Léon Gallet commissioned René Chapallaz, to design "Villa Gallet". Situated in "Parc Gallet" in the southern part of La Chaux-de-Fonds, "Villa Gallet" still retains its original name and is considered as an important historic contribution to the Swiss Art Nouveau movement of the late 19th century.
Léon L. Gallet & The Industrialization of the Swiss Watch Industry.
Any study of the 19th century industrialization of Switzerland’s “Watch Valley” is not complete without mentioning the role of watchmaker and entrepreneur, Léon L. Gallet.
In the years following America’s Civil War, a powerful shift of that country’s concentration moved from agriculture to industry. With this shift came great advancements in manufacturing as centrally located factories replaced small workshops, and large scale production of items with interchangeable parts quickly displaced less efficient hand-crafting. An immediate beneficiary of this progress was America’s watch and clock industry, as northern coal powered factories began turning out hundreds of high quality timepieces per day. On the horizon for these newly empowered companies was the inevitable expansion beyond domestic borders to embark in direct competition with the Swiss watchmaking industry.
Léon L. Gallet and Ernest Francillon of Longines, two Swiss watchmakers who were actively selling their wares in North America, saw the writing on the wall. Recognizing the only way that the small workshops of Switzerland’s “Watch Valley” could compete against the growing threat posed by larger American manufacturers was to unite. At the prompting of Gallet and Francillon, a new organization was created. The Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries) was formed to bring together the individual strengths of the region’s numerous independent watchmaking houses as a powerful cooperative entity.
Yet, in spite of the formation of this new organization, the warnings of Gallet and Francillon were met with skepticism by the other members of the group. Decades of success as the world’s primary supplier of fine timepieces had resulted in a self-assured complacency within Switzerland’s watchmaking industry.
Then on the 10th of May, 1876, the great Philadelphia International Exhibition, created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of America’s Declaration of Independence, opened to the public. Among the many displays was the indisputable evidence of the manufacturing superiority of such American companies as Waltham and Elgin, each capable of finishing many hundred watches per day.
Jacques David, Swiss watchmaker and machine designer, was dispatched to America by Ernest Francillon to witness the exhibitions first-hand, and report his findings back to the Intercanonal Society. Léon L. Gallet followed shortly behind, arriving in Philadelphia the next month. What both men witnessed at the exhibition further confirmed the concerns of Gallet and Francillon.
On his return to Switzerland in November, Jacques David wrote a long detailed report on the men’s findings to the Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries. While David’s report helped to wake the Swiss watchmaking industry from its comfortable complacency, increased revenues were needed for the Society’s members to initiate the developments required to meet these new challenges.
By the time that the Philadelphia Exposition opened to the public in 1876, Léon L. Gallet had already established sales offices in both New York and Chicago, going back over 10 years. He had personally suffered a number of long ocean voyages to deliver his wares and to conduct business. Besides his acute knowledge of the growing threat posed by worldwide competition from US manufactures, Gallet understood the tastes of the American consumer and the opportunities the new world also held for the Jura watchmakers.
With the now available joint resources from fellow manufacturing members of the Intercantonal Society, Gallet decides to take the competitive battle directly to the enemy. Not only could the rapidly expanding base of American consumers provide opportunities for increased sales of Swiss watches, these sales could provide the needed revenues to meet the expected competitive challenges in Europe.
Utilizing his own movements, as well as components by such friends as Auguste Agassiz, Ernest Francillon, Constant Girard-Perregaux, Jules Jeanneret, and Louis and Jules Courvoisier, Gallet begins production of 30 new watch brands, most designed specifically to appeal to the taste of the America consumer.
Within a short period, exports of Swiss watches to America rapidly increased, greatly expanding the reach of watchmakers whose previous market was limited only to the local economies. As a result, Leon L. Gallet’s American marketing activities helped to provide the needed capital for the watchmakers of the Jura region to industrialize, and successfully meet one of the greatest challenges in Swiss timekeeping’s history.

The peasents learn of the baron's evil ways and attack his castle (Stakes and Torches), they then celebrate their victory (Happy Birthday), The Jewish people move to this country for freedom and become a part of society (Coin Operated Goi)
Soon the country is filled with happiness and a man meets a beautiful woman (Accordion Player). they soon get married. The man realizes he has no money and decides to go out to sea to get treasure (This Sea). On his travels he meets many a gang of pirates whose leader tells a tale (The Beast of Pirate's Bay). While sailing with his new crewmates, a storm hits (Tempest) and the shop starts to sink (This Ships Going Down). Soon they sink to the bottom of the sea and meet monsters but find a cave with treasure, unable to collect it as they are trapped (To The Bottom of The Sea). Back to present day, when the children ask why he told his story, the grandpa tells them its ok to sing songs and tell tales of evil and dark things (Death Death (devil, devil, devil, devil, evil, evil, evil, evil song))
The cover features a ship being dragged to the bottom of the sea by a large tentacle. This is the first Voltaire album to not feature him on it.

1946 college football season

The 1946 NCAA football season finished with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish crowned as the national champion in the AP Poll, with the United States Military Academy named as national champion in various other polls and rankings. The two teams both had won all of their games, with the exception of their November 9 meeting at New York’s Yankee Stadium, where they had played to a 0-0 tie in a #1 vs #2 matchup regarded as a "Game of the Century".
During the 20th century, the NCAA had no playoff for the college football teams that would later be described as "Division I-A". The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of the Associated Press poll of sportswriters (the UPI Coaches poll would not start until 1950). The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual "NCAA Football Guide" of the "unofficial" national champions.
Georgia and UCLA would finish the regular season as the only unbeaten and untied teams. Georiga would even hammer this point home with a decisive Sugar Bowl win, while UCLA lost big in the Rose Bowl. Both Notre Dame and Army would not play in a bowl. Most third party observers would consider them National Champions.
Several new bowl games would debut, among them the Tangerine Bowl (later known as the Citrus Bowl and currently known as the Capital One Bowl).
September.
The Associated Press did not poll the writers until the third week of the season. Among the teams that had been ranked highest at the end of 1946, the two service academies—Army and Navy, as well as Alabama, Indiana and Oklahoma State, several had faltered before the first poll. Army beat Villanova 35-0 on September 21, and Oklahoma State beat Denver, 40-7, but Indiana lost to the University of Cincinnati, 15-6. Also on September 21, Houston of the Lone Star Conference played its first ever football game against Louisiana–Lafayette of the Louisiana Intercollegiate Conference, in which Houston was defeated by a score of 13-7. 
On September 28, Army beat Oklahoma 21-7, and Navy beat Villanova 7-0. Alabama edged Southern Mississippi in a game at Montgomery, 13-12. Indiana lost again, 21-0 at Michigan, and OK State was tied 21-21 by Arkansas. Notre Dame won at Illinois, 26-6, and UCLA beat Oregon State 50-7.
October.
On October 5, Army beat Cornell 46-21. Navy lost at Columbia and dropped the rest of its games, finishing 1-8-0. Oklahoma State lost 54-6 at Texas and would finish at 3-7-1. Notre Dame beat Pittsburgh 33-0. Michigan beat Iowa 14-7. UCLA won at Washington, 39-13. In the poll that followed, One voter split his first place vote between Texas, Army, and Notre Dame, who received 69⅓, 21⅓ and 15⅓ votes respectively. Michigan and UCLA rounded out the Top Five.
October 12 In Dallas, #1 Texas beat Oklahoma 20-13. #2 Army and #4 Michigan met in Ann Arbor, MI, and the visiting Cadets won 20-13. #3 Notre Dame beat Purdue 49-6. #5 UCLA beat #17 Stanford 26-6.
October 19 #1 Army beat #11 Columbia 48-14. #2 Notre Dame was idle. #3 Texas beat #14 Arkansas 20-0. #4 UCLA won at California 13-6. #5 Michigan and #10 Northwestern played to a 14-14 tie. #9 Tennessee beat #7 Alabama 12-0.
October 26 At the Polo Grounds in New York, #1 Army beat #13 Duke 19-0. #2 Notre Dame won at #17 Iowa, 49-6. In Houston, #3 Texas lost to #16 Rice, 18-13. #4 Tennessee lost to unranked Wake Forest, 19-6. #5 UCLA beat Santa Clara 33-7. #6 Penn beat Navy 32-19 and #7 Georgia won at Furman, 70-7
November.
November 2
In Baltimore, #2 Notre Dame defeated Navy 28-0.
November 9 A crowd of 74,000 turned out at New York's Yankee Stadium to watch #1 Army and #2 Notre Dame in a meeting of the nation's two unbeaten and untied teams. Both teams missed scoring opportunities. In the opening quarter, Army recovered a fumble on the Irish 24, but was stopped on fourth down at the 13 yard line. The Irish drove to the Army three yard line in the second quarter but no further. Army reached the Irish 20 yard line in the third quarter, but Notre Dame's Terry Brennan picked off a pass from Glenn Davis. In the last quarter, a bad punt was returned by Davis to the Irish 39 yard line, but they forced a fumble and stopped any further scoring chances. The game ended in a scoreless tie, 0-0.
. In Jacksonville, #3 Georgia beat Florida 33-14.
In Portland, #4 UCLA beat Oregon 14-0. #5 Rice lost in Little Rock to Arkansas, 7-0. #9 Penn returned to the Top Five after beating Columbia in New York's "other" football game, 41-6.

Gallet &amp; Co.

Gallet is a historical Swiss manufacturer of high-end timepieces for professional use.
Gallet is the world’s oldest watch and clock making house with history dating back to Humbertus Gallet, a clock maker who became a citizen of Geneva in 1466. The Gallet & Cie (Gallet & Company) name was officially registered by Julien Gallet (1806–1849) in 1826, who moved the family business from Geneva to La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Prior to this date, operations commenced under the name of each of the Gallet family patriarchs.
Gallet is best known during the 20th century to the present day for its line of MultiChron chronograph wristwatches. Produced primarily for military, industrial, and other professional applications, Gallet’s MultiChron watches often incorporated a number of advanced timekeeping innovations.
A Gallet timepiece of particular renown was the Flight Officer time zone chronograph. Commissioned by Senator Harry S. Truman in 1939 for pilots of the United States Army Air Forces, the Flight Officer (a.k.a. Flying Officer) had a rotating 12-hour bezel and the names of 48 major world cities printed on the periphery of the dial (face). These features made it possible to calculate changes in the time as an aviator flew across lines of longitude. Besides being the first time zone calculating wristwatch, the Flight Officer was one of the world’s first wrist chronographs to be housed in a water resistant case. Truman wore a Gallet Flight Officer during his terms as 33rd president (1945–1953).
The modern Gallet Company is one of a small handful of independent Swiss watch brands that still maintain in-house manufacturing facilities. While recently expanding the company’s marketing focus to reach a wider audience of “civilian” consumers for its expensive professional-use timepieces, Gallet continues to privately produce components and modules for a number of other entities within the luxury-class timekeeping industry.
History.
For the Gallet family of watchmakers, the relocation to La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1826 after 350 years in Geneva proved to be a most advantageous move. With the resources available in the “Watch Valley”, family patriarch Julien Gallet (1806–1849) was able to expand the new company’s distribution of its pocket watches to all of Europe.
In 1855, Julien Gallet’s son Léon (1832–1899) purchased Grumbach & Co., complete with factory and equipment, to address the need for greater manufacturing capabilities. With this increase in work area, Gallet was able to bring together under one roof many of the Jura Region’s watchmakers to help meet Europe’s increasing demand for watches.
Léon Gallet allowed his watchmakers to benefit through the registration of patents in their own names. This unique approach inspired innovation with Gallet's artisans and allowed the company to offer a very extensive range of watches. With innovation came growth and Gallet & Cie grew to become one the largest timekeeping manufacturers in Switzerland.
Léon Gallet set his sights on the rest of the world markets. In 1864, Léon's brother, Lucien Gallet (1834–1879), established the company's first US location in Chicago, with a New York City office following soon after. Together with Jules Racine, a cousin of the Gallet brothers living in the US, the company began its expansion into the American market.
Due to the American consumer’s preference for domestically styled products, the Gallet Company created numerous new lines to accommodate this. Not including watches privately labeled for established jewelry retailers, Gallet introduced thirty-seven new brands. While the names that appeared on the dials and the overall appearance and function of these watches were tailored to American tastes, all cases and movements continued to be produced in Gallet’s La Chaux-Fonds workshop.
Each of the numerous brands were designed to target a different demographic. Lower priced watches were supplied to the average working man, as well as expensive high-grade and complicated timepieces in solid gold cases for the wealthy. Gallet’s finest pocket watches, hand-built in the classic Swiss tradition and retaining the family flagship and Electa names, were always available. Although not initially successful, included with the company’s American offerings in 1895 were the world’s first wrist-worn watches produced for mass consumption. By the end of the 19th century, the Gallet family was manufacturing and selling over 100,000 timepieces per year.
When the worldwide economic downturn of the 1930s caused international trade to plunge by as much as two-thirds, it suddenly became unprofitable for the Gallet Company to continue production of many of its recently established brands. Gallet chose instead to consolidate its efforts back into its primary area of expertise, that of the manufacture of high quality professional-use timepieces. Under the family name, the Gallet Company continued to flourish by providing hand-held timers and chronograph wristwatches to allied military and industrial clients during the years leading up to and through World War II. During this period, the Gallet’s sales again surpassed 100,000 units annually.
A wartime Gallet timepiece of particular renown was the Flight Officer time-zone chronograph (1939–present). Commissioned by Senator Harry S. Truman’s senatorial staff in 1939 for the United States Army Air Force, this wristwatch made it possible to calculate changes in the time as a pilot flew across lines of longitude.
After the war, Gallet’s renewed worldwide popularity with civilians and professionals in the fields of aviation, sports, medicine, and technology eliminated the necessity to manufacture numerous secondary brands. With the exception of the few brand names that the company retained for its sports and industrial stopwatch lines, most of Gallet's previously held trademarks went back into circulation.
Early innovations.
Among the Gallet's professional timekeeping innovations are:

Bulgarian Declaration of Independence

The "de jure" independence of Bulgaria (, "Nezavisimost na Balgaria") from the Ottoman Empire was proclaimed on in the old Bulgarian capital Tarnovo by Prince (Knyaz) (afterwards Tsar) Ferdinand of Bulgaria. Bulgaria has been Europe's tenth oldest country by continuous sovereignty since that date.
Bulgaria had been a widely autonomous ("de facto" independent) principality since , when it was liberated from Ottoman rule in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. On 6 September 1885, it had unified with the Bulgarian-majority Ottoman autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia. After the Liberation, Bulgaria's main external goal was the unification of all Bulgarian-inhabited areas under foreign rule into a single Bulgarian state: the main targets of Bulgarian irredentism are Macedonia and southern Thrace, which continued to be part of the Ottoman realm. In order to join an anti-Ottoman alliance and claim those territories by war, however, Bulgaria had to proclaim its independence first. This would constitute a violation of the Treaty of Berlin's terms, an act unlikely to be approved by the Great Powers.
The chaos that ensued in the Ottoman Empire following the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 provided suitable conditions for the Bulgarian proclamation of independence. Many of the Great Powers had also abandoned their support for the Ottomans, looking for territorial gains instead: Austria-Hungary was hoping to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Kingdom was looking to seize the empire's Arab territories in the east, and the Russian Empire's main target was control over the Turkish Straits. In September 1908 at a meeting in Buchlov (, contemporary Czech Republic), envoys of Austria-Hungary and Russia supported each other's plans and agreed not to hinder Bulgaria's proclamation of independence which was likely to take place.
Towards the middle of September, the democratic government of Aleksandar Malinov had decided that the suitable moment was near. , Ferdinand arrived at Rousse from a break in his Hungarian mansion. He was awaited there by the government to discuss the final decision on board the "Krum" ship. The delegation then took the train to Tarnovo, where the official proclamation would take place. According to recent research, it was at the Dve Mogili railway station that the manifesto of independence was completed on .
The independence of Bulgaria was formally proclaimed at the SS. Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo. As a result, Bulgaria's status was promoted to that of a kingdom, increasing its international prestige. Ferdinand would adopt the title of Tsar instead of a Knyaz and the country would be ready to join the Balkan League and fight the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War of 1912–1913.
Bulgaria's declaration of independence was followed by Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia the following day and Greece's union with the Cretan State (unrecognized until 1913). With the two countries' joint violation of the Treaty of Berlin and the dominant support among European countries, the independence of Bulgaria was internationally recognized by the spring of 1909. The Ottoman Empire did not demand any financial compensation from Bulgaria because Russia cancelled the Ottomans' outstanding reparations for the war of 1877–1878. Bulgaria, however, did have to pay 82 million francs to Russia as a consequence.
The de jure independence is celebrated annually on 22 September as Bulgaria's Independence Day. On 22 September 2008, Bulgaria celebrated the centenary anniversary of its independence.

The Tufts OpenCourseWare (OCW) project, is a web-based publication of educational material from a number of Tufts University courses, providing open sharing of free, searchable, high-quality course content to educators, students, and self-learners throughout the global community. The Tufts OCW initiative encourages the publication and free exchange of course materials on the World Wide Web. First launched in June 2005, Tufts OCW provides materials with strong representation from Tufts’ health sciences schools, some of which are equivalent to textbooks in depth. All materials on the Tufts OCW site are accessible at any time, free of charge. As Tufts OCW is not a distance learning program, no registration, applications, prerequisites, or fees are required and no credit is granted. 
History.
OpenCourseWare was launched by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1999 as an initiative with the goals of providing free, searchable access to MIT’s course material for the general public and expanding the reach of the OCW concept. In 2004, Tufts was invited to join MIT in its OpenCourseWare initiative. Tufts' expertise in the health sciences and international policy complemented MIT’s strengths in engineering and science, and Tufts’ track record of creating an extensive body of digital materials and tools to support health sciences education made Tufts a ready partner. Tufts OCW launched in June 2005 as a University-wide initiative, with six courses from three of its four health sciences schools. Tufts’ partnership with MIT and other early participants in the OCW movement has evolved into the OpenCourseWare Consortium (OCWC), an organization with more than 200 member universities and associated institutions from around the world dedicated to advancing education and empowering learners through OCW. 
OER.
Tufts OCW can be considered within the broader context of the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement. OER can include open content, tools, or infrastructure. Tufts has been engaging in OER work for more than a decade, with the majority of efforts related to the development of the Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase (TUSK). TUSK is an integrated digital repository and curriculum knowledge management and delivery system used by Tufts’ health sciences schools and programs, and health sciences institutions in India, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and the United States. TUSK’s use of the National Library of Medicine’s Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as the controlled vocabulary for its content management (metadata, searching, etc.) enables the creation and delivery of integrated, developmental curricula by individuals or teams of faculty across the health sciences. In 2002, UNESCO organized the ‘‘Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries,’’ which was attended by representatives of universities from both developed and developing countries. At this conference, the term ‘‘open education resource’’ was more clearly defined as ‘‘the open provision of educational resources, enabled by information and communication technologies, for consultation, use, and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes’’. 
In addition to TUSK, a number of other Tufts OER initiatives can be accessed from the Tufts OCW site including:

Murai Urban Training Facility

The Murai Urban Training Facility (MUTF) is the Singapore Armed Forces' latest training facility created to hone the urban operations capability of its soldiers. 
The facility is located within an existing training area in Lim Chu Kang, in the vicinity of Jalan Murai. The MUTF is built to resemble a typical town, and has features such as single-level houses; a commercial district comprising multi-function, multi-storey buildings; a residential district; as well as an industrial district. To provide added realism, the training facility also has bus-stops, traffic lights and over-head bridges. West of the MUTF is the live-firing area, and Murai Reservoir.
The MUTF allows the SAF's "urban warriors" experience a range of training scenarios from tactical engagements to combined arms manoeuvres.

Edward Bell (artist)

Edward Bell studied art at Brighton College of Art, graphic design at Chelsea School of Art and photography at the Royal College of Art. He worked as a freelance photographer and illustrator for Vogue, Tatler and Elle magazines. He was commissioned for portraits for album covers for David Bowie (Scary Monsters and Tin Machine) and Hazel O'Connor (Sons and Lovers). He has exhibited widely on the London art scene and his work covers many genres from life paintings to bronzes, from pop art to landscapes.
Bell was also the subject of a film by the artist Marcus Thompson, titled "Edward".
Background and education.
Edward Bell was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College and went on to study Art at Brighton College of Art (now the Faculty of Arts (University of Brighton)). He took a Graphic design degree at Chelsea School of Art, along with amongst others, the author and designer Roger Kohn; and from there went on to take an MA in photography at the Royal College of Art. According to Bell's own account of his time at the Royal College, he clashed with the head of department and 'refused' the MA he was awarded,
"Studying photography at the Royal proved a disappointment, for them and me. The then head of department would have been more suited to coaching a rugby scrum. I reacted, and on being awarded the MA refused it in disgust. (It turned up months later in the post.)"
Bell worked as a freelance photographer undertaking various iconic art projects including work for Vogue and Tatler, as well as the Album cover for David Bowie's Scary Monsters of which he has written:
"This client was dressed in an insipid yellow, short sleeved shirt and bright red trousers, but most damning of all he wore dark glasses to examine the pictures. I was introduced to:
“David”
“David who?”
“David Bowie”
After ‘dropping-out’ of the London art scene, and for a while becoming a self-confessed heroin addict Bell took 'time out' in Venice and Florence. His return to the Art World in 2003 was marked by an exhibition in Gallery 286, London, entitled "Re-nude". It was closely followed by "Pulse", a collection of symbolic abstracts:
“I believe us all to be a combination of black and white hearts and life about crossing out as many black as possible. Here I depict the varied combinations of black white, tranquil, tortured, grey, craven, colourful, Mickey Mouse, monstrous …."
Recent work.
Bell's work has tended to be focused in two areas nudes and landscapes. His recent exhibition of landscapes in oil "Stunning Moments" at the Arterie Gallery in Ludlow, was described by BBC Shropshire in the following terms:
"The speed of painting is one of the most enthralling aspects of the exhibition. Amid the complex abstraction of colour and landscape, there's an engaging simplicity of brush strokes, light and shade. The speed of capture also translates into an energy, even within some of the darkest backdrops, punctuated with their small, almost horizontal flashes of iridescent colour." 
Bell's latest exhibition "One Sky", Gallery 286 is a series of skyscapes and landscapes, painted 'en plein air' in oil on canvas or board.
Additional information.
In 2005, Bell was among the many artists, including Sir Paul McCartney, David Hockney, Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst who produced a postcard, selected by Bernard Williams of Christie's, for the "Art of Care" Auction in Edinburgh.

<doc id="19425551" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19425551" title="National Reconciliation Ordinance">
National Reconciliation Ordinance

The National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) was a controversial ordinance issued by the former President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, on 5 October 2007. It granted amnesty to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats who were accused of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder, and terrorism between 1 January 1986, and 12 October 1999, the time between two states of martial law in Pakistan. It was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Pakistan on 16 December 2009, throwing the country into a political crisis.
Background.
The ordinance aimed at "promoting national reconciliation, fostering mutual trust and confidence amongst holders of public office and removing the vestiges of political vendetta and victimisation, and to make the election process more transparent". The NRO states:
It is widely believed that the act was a measure to allow the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to return to Pakistan without any legal consequences due to pending politically motivated corruption cases. However, Musharraf had said that it was necessary to build a reconciliatory theme in the political arena with the removal of such politically motivated cases. Musharraf stated in an interview that cases had been in the courts for a decade without any judgment being passed and were hampering political progress of virtually all political parties.
According to Transparency International, Pakistan is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world. For the year 2009 it was ranked 42nd out of 180 and had a score of 2.4 on the Corruption Perceptions Index.
Furthermore some analyst believe ' US, the UK and Saudi Arabia underwrote a public amnesty which would enable popular politicians such as Benazir Bhutto to return to the country and counter the Taliban.'
Subsequent developments.
The former Chief Justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, suspended this ordinance on 12 October 2007. But he was soon dismissed after Musharraf abrogated the constitution on 3 November 2007. The new Chief Justice, Abdul Hameed Dogar revived the NRO on 27 February 2008.
Release of list of NRO beneficiaries.
In November 2009, Government of Pakistan released the list of the beneficiaries of the National Reconciliation Ordinance on the directives of Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani. The total list was 8041 beneficiaries most of which are bureaucrats, along with a handful of politicians. The cases also included some high-ranking politicians, such as the current President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gillani. The NRO was planned to be presented in the National Assembly but later due to the opposition of several major parties was not presented in the Assembly. According to State Minister for Law Afzal Sindhu in a news conference, the ordinance affected 8041 people, including 34 politicians and three ambassadors.
Dissolution of NRO by Supreme Court.
On 16 December 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared NRO unconstitutional. A 17-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, declared the ordinance null and void. The Supreme Court also said that all the cases disposed of because of the controversial ordinance now stand revived as of 5 Oct 2007, position. The court opined that the NRO "seems to be against national interests thus it violates the provisions of the constitution". Western diplomats subsequently expressed concern that Pakistan could face further instability due to this ruling, especially if Mr Zardari's political opponents try to remove him from office. However, the verdict was widely welcomed in Pakistan.
After this verdict, Pakistan's National Accountability Bureau asked the Interior Ministry to bar 248 people, including Interior Minister of Pakistan Rehman Malik, from leaving the country. The following day an arrest warrant was issued against Malik. Defence Minister of Pakistan Chaudhry Ahmad Mukhtar was stopped from departing the country on a trip to China at Islamabad airport. Writing in the Pakistani newspaper "Dawn", columnist Cyril Almeida stated "It's chaos out there. Nobody knows what's going on. Everyone is trying to work out the ramifications of the court order."
The political crises deepened as the government was paralysed and the country seemed to slide towards a coup with it being increasingly unclear whether the elected politicians, the judiciary or somebody else was running the country. The extent of the crises led to speculation whether the Army had any role to play in this. The situation was described as a 'creeping coup'. Asma Jahangir chairperson of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan was quoted as saying 'It's complete (judicial) control now, the issue is whether the (democratic) system is going to pack up again.' In an editorial in "Dawn" she criticised the judiciary and called the judgement a 'witchhunt'. She also remarked 'long-term effects of the judgment could also be counter-productive; perpetrators are often viewed as victims if justice is not applied in an even-handed manner and if administered in undue haste with overwhelming zeal.'
The scene is still seems to be vague. In an hearing of NRO Case, the supreme court was told that government was looking for a lawyer upon which it could trust to run the government's side while chief justice of Pakistan has asked the government to adopt all necessary measures otherwise the Prime Minister of Pakistan has to appear and proceed the case himself.
NRO beneficiaries.
Selected NRO beneficiaries include:
Other than these there are hundreds of political as well as non-political persons who have benefited from this ordinance. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) presented a list of 248 politicians and bureaucrats to the government, whose cases were cleared by NAB due to NRO.

Tiffany Cole

Tiffany Ann Cole (born December 3, 1981) was found guilty of the kidnapping and first-degree murder of a Duval County, Florida husband and wife and sentenced to death. Also found guilty in the case were three men: Alan Wade, Bruce Nixon, and Cole's boyfriend Michael Jackson. Prosecutors said Cole and the three men developed a plan to kidnap and kill the couple to steal their money, and dug a grave for them in Charlton County, Georgia two days before knocking on their door and asking to use the phone. 
Capital murder case.
Cole was a familiar face to Carol and Reggie Sumner, having been a neighbor of the 61-year-old couple when they lived in South Carolina. Also, Cole had bought a car from them at the time the Sumners moved to Jacksonville, Florida in March 2005. Cole and her boyfriend went to Florida in late June, 2005 to complete the paperwork on the car and stayed at the Sumner home. 
Shortly after that visit, in early July 2005, Cole and three men appeared at the Sumners home and asked to use the phone. Reggie Sumner was choked and forced to give the intruders his ATM card and its access number.
He and his wife were bound and gagged with duct tape, put into the trunk of their car and driven across the border to Georgia, where, blindfolded and bound, they were pushed into the grave and buried alive. 
Cole subsequently pawned jewelry and other items stolen from the Sumners' home, and the ATM card was used to obtain more than $1000 in cash. Three of the group were tracked back to a hotel in South Carolina by the use of the ATM card and arrested there. Juries were later shown photos of Cole and two co-defendants in a limousine, celebrating with champagne and handfuls of cash.
At Cole's week-long trial in October 2007, the jury deliberated less than 90 minutes before finding her guilty of first-degree murder. They voted 9 to 3 that she should receive the death penalty. Five months later, a judge handed down two death sentences for the murders, and a sentence to life in prison for the kidnappings. She awaits execution at Lowell Correctional Institution Annex.
Cole is one of five women currently on Florida's death row, the others being Margaret Allen, Tina Brown, Ana Maria Cardona and Emilia Carr, all sentenced to death in unrelated murders.
Wade and Jackson also received two death sentences and await execution. Nixon, who had led police to the bodies and testified against the others, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 45 years in prison.

Competition Cams

Competition Cams, Inc., or COMP Cams, is a specialty performance automotive, motorcycle, and kart aftermarket parts manufacturer. The company has five US locations including headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee.
History.
Although founded in 1976, Competition Cams wasn't incorporated until 1977, when it began by selling valve train products through satellite distribution stores. The company has acquired manufacturers of transmissions, electronic fuel injection, and nitrous oxide through its holding group, COMP Performance Group, consisting of 13 companies. 
In the late 1980s, the company contributed to the Specialty Equipment Market Association, and its annual trade show in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Competition Cams was started by John McWhirter, Ivars Smiltniks, Tom Woitesek, and Bob Woodard. Current owners, Ron Coleman, and Paul Brothers were inducted into the SEMA Hall of Fame.
Industry contributions.
COMP Cams created the Spintron engine testing system, which involves outfitting an engine with high-speed sensors and cameras to record data, and using an electric motor to drive the engine. The test observes valve-spring seat pressure, coil dynamics, camshaft/ pushrod flex, and lifter movement to identify problems in the engine's performance.
A partnership between Richard Childress Racing, Okuma, and COMP Cams was established to develop the process for grinding a camshaft for a NASCAR engine, with an Okuma GC34NH cylindrical grinding machine; a CNC grinder.
COMP Cams most recent development is the process of ion nitriding for camshafts, or Pro Plasma Nitriding. This is a 36-hour process that uses pulsed nitrogen plasma in a vacuum controlled environment to imbed chains of nitrogen ions into the camshaft surface approximately .008” - .010” deep, significantly hardening the surface.
Sponsorship.
Competition Cams does not sponsor a NASCAR team directly, but has access to advertising through a deal with NASCAR where the COMP Cams contingency sticker is placed on every NASCAR race car. Contingency is a common form of 'after the fact' sponsorship whereby racers place stickers on their vehicles from companies that post monetary awards to racing teams for winning, in exchange for visibility and the right to use images of the driver and their car in promotional literature and advertising. Similarly, COMP Cams also posts contingency awards to drag racers and various other classes of auto racing.

2008 Chinese milk scandal.
In 2008, a crisis occurred in China in which melamine-tainted powdered milk was found being produced by a large number of Chinese dairy manufacturers. Melamine was found in 22 out of 109 manufacturers tested including industry majors Mengniu, Yili, Bright Dairy and Yashili. Three different Yashili subsidiaries and brands were found to have melamine: Guangdong Yashili Group, Shanxi Yashili Dairy and Scient (Guangzhou) Infant Nutrition. Across the three Yashili infant formula products tested, 24 out of 54 samples were found to have melamine. Yashili's infant formula products were the only Chinese infant formula being exported and no melamine was found in those products. Yashili captured contaminated or suspect product from distributors and filmed it being burned. It also used company funds to buy back the product from distributors. Yashili International said the melamine incident had caused it a total loss of 787 million yuan in 2008, which were mainly attributable to the costs and expenses relating to product recalls and decreased sales in the second half of 2008. Yashili said in a separate statement that it appointed safety experts to help improve consumer confidence in its products. A six-person panel will be headed by Robert Brackett, a former director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In February 2009 new allegations emerged against Yashili. The Legal Weekly claimed that the Shanxi Yashili Dairy Company had repackaged 30 tonnes of contaminated milk powder as new product. Yashili denied the accusation.
Marketing and sales channels.
Yashili sell its products via a comprehensive national sales and distribution network, which covers all regions within mainland China. The milk powder products sales network comprises around 1,500 regional distributors, who directly or indirectly further distribute Yashili's products to over 105,000 retail outlets, including supermarkets, department stores, specialty stores and large membership chain supermarkets as well as grocery stores. Yashili also sells its products to 15,000 maternal and child stores, which it claims had pushed up market share in this channel, bringing new growth points for the Group’s performance. The company's extensive milk powder products distribution network is formed by more than 2,300 marketing staff under the support of over 600 liaison locations.
Brand building.
In the “2011 Annual Meeting on Competitiveness of Chinese Brand and Third Summit of Chinese Brands and Brand Leaders” held in Beijing in March 2012, Yashily was given the “2011 Most Influential Brand Award in China”. In July 2012, “Yashily” was named 500 Most Valuable Brand in China with a brand value of RMB9.865 billion, ranking 154 overall. Compared to 2011, Yashili's brand value increased by RMB2.09 billion, while its ranking went up nine places.
Brand image association with New Zealand.
Early in 2012, Yashili began a marketing campaign promoting the company's infant formula's New Zealand milk powder content by adding the slogan "Pure New Zealand, Cherish Yashili" to its product range ( pinyin 'chunjing Xinxilan, zhen'ai Yashili). The company's marketing slogan is also featured across the home page of the Yashili company website. The company's leading brand 'a-Golden Stage' (）has the byline 'made from high quality New Zealand sourced milk' (）In the company's 2012 interim report Yashili noted that "All of our branded paediatric milk formula products are mainly produced by imported premium raw materials procured from New Zealand". An interactive internet event named “Experience excellent milk sources with a trip in New Zealand” was held in 2012 with 5 million participants. Also, over 2,000 parent-child roadshows and activities were held from first-tier cities to second and third-tier cities, and winning consumers were invited to participate in “6-day trip to experience milk source in New Zealand”. Since August 2010, Yashili has sourced all its milk for its infant formula products from New Zealand.
Overseas Investments.
In January 2013 Yashili International Holdings announced plans to build a processing plant in New Zealand, its first major offshore investment. The manufacturing facility will produce finished products and semi-finished products, including base milk powder, in an industrial park at Pokeno in the Waikato region just south of Auckland. Annual production capacity is expected to be 52,000 tonnes. The total investment involved in the establishment of the facility is estimated to be 1.1 billion yuan (NZ$210 million) including 950 million yuan (NZ$181m) for acquisition of land and the cost of construction of the facility, and 150 million yuan (NZ$28.6m) for working capital of Yashili New Zealand Dairy Company. That company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Yashili's New Zealand subsidiary Yashili International Holdings Ltd, which will establish and operate the New Zealand facility. The project is expected to be completed and running in the second half of 2014 and employ some 100 local staff. Yashili New Zealand has submitted an application for consent for the investment to New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office (OIO) in late 2012.
Financial results.
For the six months ended 30 June 2012, Yashili group’s revenue amounted to RMB1,689.1 million, a 17.0% increase compared to the same period of the preceding year. If annualised, this would give Yashili 2012 sales revenue of at least RMB3,378.2 million (USD$544 million). Infant formula sales increased 20% to RMB1,448.9 million while sales in other product categories declined or showed a small increase. Infant formula sales made up 80% of the company's total sales during this period. Sales of Yashily branded infant formula increased by 27.3% while sales of the firm's Scient brand declined 0.8%. The strongest segment growth was recorded for Yashily branded infant formula in third tier cities which increased 54.2% during this period to reach RMB458.2 million, accounting for 40% of Yashily-branded infant formula sales.
China infant formula market.
China's infant formula brand is highly fragemented with more than 100 brands of which only a dozen or so are significant. Definitions of the size of the pediatric milk product market vary depending on the extent to which infant formula products sold outside the modern trade sector are measured. According to Euromonitor International, in 2011 China's sales volume of infant formula market in China reached RMB62.1 billion. Euromonitor forecast that compound annual growth rate from 2011 to 2016 would be 15.6%, while the 2016 market size will reach RMB128.4 billion. (approx. USD$21 billion). These figures suggest that in 2011 Yashili's share of China's infant formula market was around 1.6%. These figures also suggest that the total market in 2012 was RMB72 billion (USD$11.6 billion). 
Over 80% of China's infant formula market is dominated by international brands. After Nestle's 2012 acquisition of Wyeth, Nestle was reported to have 14.4% of the Chinese market and Mead Johnson 14%. Yashili is one of the largest local Chinese manufacturers of infant formula which includes Yili and Beingmate.

Advanced Combat Man System

The Advanced Combat Man System (ACMS) is part of the Singapore Armed Forces's (SAF) move to integrate into 3G to progressively provide tactical units with network capabilities, including C4I capabilities in the field. The project costs about $SGD 100 Million to maintain.
The head of the ACMS project is Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Toh Yong Leng. According to him, ACMS was created to address concern of urban warfare operations, especially "key challenges in this environment were survivability, situational awareness (SA) and the avoidance of civilian casualties and collateral damage."
In a future deployment, the section commander and two commanding officers are to be equipped with the ACMS system as a part of honing urban operation capabilities.
History.
The ACMS was first developed in 1998 as a joint project by the Singaporean Army and by the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) alongside ST Electronics and ST Kinetics under a Technology Exploration and Demonstration initiative in order to assess the possibility of simplifying capability and integration issues. It was succeeded in 2002 with a three-year Technology Consolidation and Development effort. Trials took place in 2006 with funding allocated to the Integrated Concept Development and Demonstration stage, which permitted the acquisition of 60 ACMS sets and ACMS sets and two CCIS equipped AFV platforms. Further trails took place in 2008 when Singaporean soldiers conducted live exercises at the Murai Urban Training Facility.
ST Electronics was chosen to be the main contractor responsible for the eventual production of the ACMS. Research and development of the ACMS was completed by 2012. Field tests began in January and March 2010 when two Singaporean Army battalions were equipped with ACMS gear.
Design.
The challenge with the creation of ACMS was the stature of the average Singaporean soldier, considering that they are smaller than other races. The three modular variants consist of the Basic Fighting System, which is focused on fighting capabilities. The Full Fighting System equips commanders on the field, but has significant C2 capabilities. The Hand Held System which works with the Full Fighting System, which is carried by a commander’s aide, providing notebook hosted capabilities, which in trials used a Panasonic Toughbook, for use in stationary mission planning tasks, where greater screen size is necessary and a more complex input device can be used.
The main weapon used under the ACMS is the SAR 21's Modular Mounting System variant. For communications, ACMS uses Selex Soldier Personal Radio systems with a noise reduction system to protect the hearing of soldiers.
In various trials done initially, the helmet mounted display was cited to be a hindrance in aiming and moving. Currently, alternatives are being studied, which includes see through HMDs and membrane displays.
Components.
The components of the ACMS consist of Soldier Computer, Weapon, Head Mount Display, Power, Communications and Navigation sub-systems. An integrated Load Bearing Vest and a hydration bladder are also included, the former being outfitted with armored plates.
Variants.
ACMS.
The first variants of the ACMS system, it had a total weight of 25 kilograms. The weight proved to be bothersome since it forced wearers to move less than one kilometer in the field. A 2002 revision reduced the weight to 12.5 kilograms. Currently, ACMS includes a soldier computer subsystem, including a wearable computer and power pack, the communications subsystem supporting wireless radio and data connectivity through mesh networking, full color OLED based helmet mounted display and active noise diction hearing protection, indoor and outdoor navigation system with GPS support, and weapon-mounted camera with an ITL MARS reflex sight.
ACMS Lite.
Currently undergoing development, the ACMS Lite has latest ARM processor and mobile communications technology to enhance networking and situational awareness capability. The ACMS Lite also includes a smartphone portable device providing mesh-networking communications, processing and display of situational awareness and support of C2 applications. It will also include fabric cabling integrated into the vest, offering more reliable and lightweight, low power solution. It's designed for use by team leaders and their members.

Bryan Gruley

Bryan Gruley (born November 1957) is an American writer. He has shared a Pulitzer Prize for journalism and been nominated for the "first novel" Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America.
Career.
Gruley is currently a reporter for Bloomberg News, writing long form features for "Bloomberg Businessweek" magazine. He worked more than 15 years for "The Wall Street Journal" including seven years as Chicago bureau chief. 
With the "Journal", he also helped cover breaking news including the September 11 World Trade Center attack, and shared in the staff's Pulitzer Prize for that work, which cited "its comprehensive and insightful coverage, executed under the most difficult circumstances, of the terrorist attack on New York City, which recounted the day's events and their implications for the future."
Gruley's first novel, "Starvation Lake: a mystery", was published in 2009 as a trade paperback original by the Touchstone Books imprint of Simon & Schuster. It is set in the fictional town of Starvation Lake, based on Bellaire, the seat of Antrim County, Michigan. The real Starvation Lake is a lake in the next county, but the fictional town is on the lake, and the novel begins when the snowmobile of a long-missing youth hockey coach "washes up on the icy shores". Two sequels have followed in the so-called Starvation Lake series, "The Hanging Tree" (2010) and "The Skeleton Box" (2012). As of May 2013 Gruley is working on a new novel set in a different town with different characters.
Gruley played ice hockey as a boy and continues to play in his fifties, and to root for the Detroit Red Wings. He was schooled in Detroit, at Detroit Catholic Central, but the family vacationed up north and acquired a cottage in 1971 on Big Twin Lake near Bellaire, which the six siblings still frequent. His first newspaper job was in the region as a 1978 summer intern at "Antrim County News".
Gruley and his wife Pam currently live on the North Side of Chicago. They have three grown children.

Cabonga Reservoir

The Cabonga Reservoir () is a man-made lake in central Quebec, Canada, with a total surface area of and a net area (water only) of . It is located on the boundary between the unorganized territories of Lac-Pythonga and Réservoir-Dozois, and fully within the La Vérendrye Wildlife Reserve. The First Nations reserve of Rapide Lake is on its western shores.
Its name is derived from the Algonquin "kakibonga" and means "completely blocked by sand."
The reservoir has 2 outlets: the Gens de Terre River flowing to the south-east which is a tributary of the Baskatong Reservoir and Gatineau River; and an outflow to the north-west flowing directly into Barrière Lake which is part of the Ottawa River system. Both outflows are controlled by dams to regulate the flow on these respective rivers.
Many fishing magazines and websites consider Cabonga Reservoir one of North America's top 20 walleye and northern pike waters. And "Outdoor Canada" magazine includes it among its "simply the best" hot spots for lake trout fishing.
History.
Before its impoundment, Lake Cabonga was considered the largest body of water between the Gatineau and Ottawa Rivers. In 1851, the Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post at this lake (named Kakabonga at that time). The post burned down in 1873, and was not rebuilt but replaced by a new post on Barrière Lake. In 1928-1929, a dam at the outlet of the lake, the Gens de Terre River, was constructed to create a water reserve for logging companies to float their logs downstream. Some 37 natural lakes were thus combined and formed a single reservoir with an area of , dotted with innumerable islands (some with considerable proportions) and deep bays.
Surveyor H. C. Symmes, in a report dating from 1864, used "Kakibonga" to designate the lake. In 1911, one map named it "Lake Kakabonga". Finally in 1924, the "Commission de Géographie" approved its current name.
Fauna.
Fish species found in the lake are: lake trout, yellow walleye, northern pike, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, sauger, white sucker, and yellow perch.

Thomas Lodwig

Thomas Lodwig was an English doctor, accused of murdering a patient with terminal cancer in 1990. He was acquitted after the prosecution offered no evidence at his trial.
Case history.
Lodwig was senior house officer at Battle Hospital, Reading. A 48 year old patient with terminal pancreatic cancer had been receiving regular and increasing doses of heroin for pain relief. Morphine was also administered. By 29 September 1988, the patient was in "continuous and uncontrollable pain and having fits". His family, expecting him to die, asked Lodwig to do "something - anything" to relieve his pain. Lodwig instructed a nurse to bring him some potassium chloride and lignocaine. When the nurse asked why, he said, "I'm sending someone out there". He then "drew a finger across his throat and pointed in the air" (an act his counsel later claimed was said as a joke). A few minutes later the patient died. The nurses on the ward became suspicious and the next day the hospital administration called the police.
Lodwig did not record in his notes the use of the potassium chloride or lignocaine, or the exact time of death.
A postmortem established that the patient also had "significant narrowing of the coronary arteries".
Trial.
Lodwig's trial was held at the Old Bailey in London on 15 March 1990. The forensic pathologist advising the prosecution determined the cause of death to be acute potassium poisoning. In court though, the prosecution stated that its main medical witness was no longer convinced that the patient had died solely from a potassium overdose. In addition,
Lodwig argued that his intention had been to "kill the pain and not the patient and that he had tried a method which had been the subject of experiments conducted by professors at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London - namely, the use of potassium chloride with pain killers to accelerate their analgesic effect". These trials had supposedly been "encouraging" but at the time had not been published. Taking both these factors into account, the prosecution decided to offer no evidence.

The Curtis XF13C (Model 70) was a carrier-based fighter aircraft built by Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company.
Development and design.
The XF13C was a naval fighter featuring an all-metal construction, with a semi-monocoque fuselage, manually retractable landing gear and an enclosed cockpit. The aircraft was designed to facilitate conversions from biplane to monoplane and vice-versa. The United States Navy bought a prototype, designated XF13C-1 when in monoplane configuration, and XF13C-2 when a biplane.
The XF13C first flew in 1934 with good results realized in tests. In 1935, the aircraft received a more powerful engine and modifications to the overly tall tailplanes. The designation was changed to XF13C-3 for more flight testing.
Operational history.
No production orders were received for the Curtis XF13C, but the aircraft continued to fly for NACA in experimental work, and by VWJ-1 Squadron at Quantico.

Francis Fenner

Francis Phillips Fenner (1 March 1811 – 22 May 1896) was an English cricketer for Hampshire. A right-arm fast bowler, Fenner took 176 wickets for his county at 19.00 from his 54 first-class appearances from 1829 until 1856.
He established Fenner's cricket ground in 1848 on land which he had leased. The ground is still used by Cambridge University for their home fixtures.
Career.
Born in Cambridge, Fenner played first-cricket from 1832 for his local town cricket club, in 1839 for Cambridge University, and made his debut for Hampshire in 1843. Fenner's career had not begun well with the bat, his average never reaching double figures through the first seasons of his pre-Hampshire career from 1829 until 1833. In 1834 he scored 72 runs from four matches at 12.00, and in 1837 he scored 58 in one match at 29.00 including one knock of 37. From 1840 until his debut for Hampshire he averaged 18.90, 16.66 with a career best of 80 and 15.28, however in his debut year for the county side this dropped until 8.62, and in his second season in 1844 he played in only one match, scoring 17.
He would only make a few appearances for the rest of his career never more than three matches in the season. His average did not peak above a season-high of 19.00 from 1844 until 1853. In 1854, however, he hit career best figures with the bat, playing one innings and scoring 62. While his career best individual score of 80 from 1834 remained unbroken, this knock gave him a career best season average of 62.00. This success did not continue, however, and his last seasons during 1855 and 1856 saw averages of 8.00 and 4.50 from only two matches.
It was with the ball that Fenner enjoyed more success. While he began his career as a bowler quietly, with only three wickets across his first two seasons, his bowling improved in 1834 with a return of 22 wickets. Returns of six and eight in the next two years were overshadowed by 14 wickets in 1838, and 11 wickets in 1840, 27 in 1841, 24 in 1843 and 17 in 1844. Single figure returns of seven, six, three and one followed, before a brief resurgence of 15 in 1849, however he was unable to take a wicket with the 48 deliveries of his final season in 1853.

Naum Shtarkman

Naum Lvovich Shtarkman (; 28 September 1927, Zhitomir - 19 July 2006, Moscow) was a Soviet and Russian classical pianist. 
He was a disciple of Konstantin Igumnov at the Moscow Conservatory. Shtarkman was awarded a 5th prize at the V Fryderyk Chopin Competition and, most notably, attained the Bronze Medal at the inaugural edition of the Tchaikovsky Competition. He had previously won the 1st place at Vianna da Motta International Music Competition. For several decades his concert career was restricted to the Soviet scene. 
Shtarkman was a professor at the Gnessin State Musical College and the Moscow Conservatory.
From the Russian Wikipedia page: 
The first concert with an orchestra, Mendelssohn concerto, he has played at age 11. Incredibly quickly, a year later, he gave a solo concert at the Great Hall of the Conservatory, a program which consisted of works by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt. In 1944 he began studying at the Moscow Conservatory in the class of the great pianist and teacher Konstantin Igumnov.
He graduated from the Tchaikovsky Moscow Conservatory in 1949, under the instruction of Constantine Igumnov ( Igumnov died in 1948, but Naum Shtarkman refused to finish training with another teacher, and was preparing for graduation without a formal mentor, informal consultation with Sviatoslav Richter).
In the 1950s he participated in various international competitions, becoming, in particular, the first winner of the International Piano Competition, named Vianna da Motta (Lisbon, 1957) and received the third prize of the First International Tchaikovsky Competition (1958). However, shortly thereafter, Shtarkman was arrested and convicted under Article 121 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR (homosexuality). He was arrested in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov, hours before he was scheduled to perform at a factory, as a special performance.
Despite the brevity of the incarceration (8 years), this has totally shattered his concert career: thor years Shtarkman was allowed only to perform in the far off provinces or in the secondary concert halls. The arrest had also become an impediment to educational activities of Shtarkman: from 1969 he freelanced unofficially at the School of Gnessin and only in 1987 became a professor at the Moscow Conservatory. After that he began to perform in many countries around the world.
Since 1993, Shtarkman was the permanent chairman of the jury of the International Competition of Pianists named after Igumnov, ongoing in Lipetsk.

Ompok

Ompok is a genus of sheatfishes native to Asia.
They are sometimes called "butter catfishes", but this can also refer to the African genus "Schilbe" of the family Schilbeidae.
Taxonomy.
The genus is recognized to be paraphyletic. The species of "Ompok" have been grouped into species groups, such as the "Ompok bimaculatus" group (i.e. "O. bimaculatus", "O. malabaricus", "O. miostomus"), the "O. eugeneiatus" group (i.e. "O. eugeneiatus", "O. pinnatus"), the "O. hypophthalmus" group (i.e. "O. hypopthalmus", "O. rhabdinurus", "O. urbaini"), and the "O. leiacanthus" group ("O. fumidus", "O. jaynei", "O. leiacanthus"). On the other hand, the monophyly of these species groups is not strong enough to reassign species to other genera. 
The "O. eugeneiatus" group is likely to be more closely related to "Kryptopterus" than the other "Ompok" species. According to Ferraris "O. eugeneiatus" has been reclassified into "Kryptopterus", however "O. pinnatus" has not.
Species.
There are currently 27 recognized species in this genus: 
The taxonomic position and/or validity of several of the above species is uncertain and further studies may result in the removal of those species from the species list.
Distribution and habitat.
"Ompok" species are usually found in lakes and large rivers throughout South and Southeast Asia.

Mainly an improviser in a solo performance setting, Moe! Staiano (the exclamation mark is sometimes a part of his name) has no formal training in music and would play in unconventional ways such as drumming a bat on a snare or placing vibrators on cymbals.
He usually uses objects found earlier, but later decided to move to doing prepared percussion drumming on found objects on his trap set. During the years he has experimented with solo percussion using pipes, food pans, pressure caps, sheet metals, knick-knacks & other stuff that has acquiered, including a nifty Spatula that he bows over. Some times he starts to run around, throw pipes on to concrete, walk on pans with his feet to mute sounds, running amok with his kit, and sometimes even throwing his body into old cassette tapes or two dozen cymbals in any given performance.
His early years.
He used to work for Pizza Hut before becoming a musician.
His early destructive performances were known to have Moe! showering audiences with packaging popcorn or even hot sparks from a metal grinder and wrapping them up with yellow caution tape and destroy an arsenal of television sets, dishes and other breakable objects and setting off loud fireworks to end a typical show. Early influences of acts such as Foetus, Einstürzende Neubauten and Z'EV (with whom he once collaborated) were evident in his playing and shows as he used various found "junk" such as springs, sheet metals, oil barrels, pipes and other metal objects as percussion. He has toned down a little with his current shows, usually using prepared drum kits and guitar loops to create a more one-man band sound, though he still breaks an object or old 78 RPM records over his head from time to time.
His later Years.
In 1997, he started his large ensemble collective, MOE!KESTRA!, which employs a rotating cast of available musicians playing Staiano's text "instructional"/graphic scores for large orchestras as well as conducted improvised performances. He has been known for doing compositions that involve unconventional instrumentation such as bundt pans. One such piece is 'Piece No.7: In Inescapable Siren Within Earshot Distance Therein And Other Whereabouts' employs U-bolts, wine glasses, sirens and guitars with six E-strings along with percussion and strings. 
He is a former metal percussionist in the RIO/avant rock band Sleepytime Gorilla Museum and has played alongside former drummers Dave Shamrock, Frank Grau and current SGM drummer Matthias Bossi. He was one of the original members at its formation in 1999 until he left for personal reasons in September 2004. In January 2006, Moe! formed a new post-punk band, Mute Socialite, playing drums and percussive guitar along with Ava Mendoza on Guitar, Alee Karim on bass, Shayna Dunkleman on second drum set and, later, Liz Allbee on trumpet; all former students of Mills College. They have released one full-length album, 2008's "More Popular Than Presidents and Generals" and one 7" single, "Cheap Clocks". Moe! Staiano finished working on a new post-punk project, Surplus 1980, which includes members of both Mute Socialite, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum and the Ex. Sleepytime Gorilla Museum has one release with Moe! on Seeland (Negativland's label) and a live CD on Chicago's Sickroom Records.
He was also a member musician with Theater of Yugen since 2006 and performed alongside Noh Dance Plays. He also played drums and percussion with Vacuum Tree Head.

NaVorro Bowman

NaVorro Roderick Bowman (born NaVorro Andrews on May 28, 1988) is an American football linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Penn State University. He was selected by the San Francisco 49ers with the 91st overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. 
Early years.
Bowman started sports at a young age and was a member of District Heights boys and girls club, where he played both basketball and football and was invited to many All-star Events. Bowman was a standout player at Suitland High School in Forestville, Maryland. He missed most of his senior season with a shoulder injury, but he had a very impressive junior campaign in which he recorded 165 tackles, 9 sacks, and 3 fumble recoveries as a linebacker and ran for 1,200 yards and 22 touchdowns as a running back. He was named the Maryland Defensive Player-of-the-Year, first-team All-State, "Washington Post" first-team All-Met and first-team All-Conference. He was recruited to Penn State by Larry Johnson, Sr.
College career.
2007.
After redshirting the 2006 season, Bowman played in nine games in 2007. He missed two games due to a sprained ankle suffered at Illinois. He recorded 16 tackles, with a sack, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, a blocked kick, and a pass breakup that season.
2008.
Bowman saw increased playing time in 2008, largely due to the graduation of All-American linebacker Dan Connor and injury to presumptive starter Sean Lee. Despite the attrition, however, Bowman kept the Nittany Lions ranked in the top ten among three primary defensive categories. Individually, Bowman led the Nittany Lions in total tackles (106), solos (61), and assisted tackles (45), was second in tackles for loss (16.5) and tied for third in sacks (4.0). He also forced two fumbles, recovered a fumble, grabbed an interception and had five pass breakups.
His first start came in week four versus Temple. He recorded 11 tackles, including five tackles for loss and three sacks, a forced fumble and an interception in the 45-3 win and was named Big Ten Co-Defensive Player of the Week.
He finished the season with a heavy heart and an outstanding performance. Bowman played against Southern California in the 2009 Rose Bowl one day after his high school coach, Nick Lynch, was killed in an automobile accident in Maryland. Bowman responded by breaking the Penn State bowl record with five tackles for loss (minus-21 yards), and tying the Rose Bowl record set by Ohio State's Andy Katzenmoyer in the 1997 game. He also recorded his fourth sack of the season among his eight tackles (seven solo) against the Trojans. For his superb efforts against USC, Bowman was selected to ESPN.com's 2008-09 All-Bowl team, one of two Big Ten players named to the squad.
At season's end, he was named a consensus first team All-Big Ten.
Professional career.
2010 NFL Draft.
On January 4, 2010, Bowman's mother announced his decision to forgo his final year of NCAA eligibility and enter the 2010 NFL Draft. On the second day of the 2010 NFL Draft, Bowman was selected in the third round with the 91st overall pick by the San Francisco 49ers. He wears number 53.
2010.
Bowman played in all 16 games, starting one in place of Patrick Willis. Willis was ruled out for Week 17 after undergoing a second surgery on his broken right hand.
NaVorro Bowman's statistics in 2010
2011.
In his second NFL season, Bowman became the starter at inside linebacker with the departure of Takeo Spikes to free agency. Starting alongside All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis, Bowman made huge strides and finished the year with 143 tackles, 2 sacks, and 8 pass deflections. In addition, he was also the team leader in tackles, while finishing second in the NFL in solo tackles. With the emergence in Bowman's play, he helped a top ranked 49ers defense set a NFL single season record of not allowing a rushing touchdown for 14 games. The previous record was held by the 1920 Decatur Staleys, who did not allow a rushing touchdown in a 13 game season. Although he was not voted to the Pro Bowl for his stellar season, he was named to the First-Team All-Pro by the Associated Press. He was also voted No. 85 on NFL Network's Top 100 Players of 2012, which recognizes performance from the previous season.
NaVorro Bowman's statistics in 2011
2012.
Bowman once again earned First-Team All-Pro honors, and was one of a league high nine 49ers selected to the Pro Bowl, six of which came from the defensive side.
Bowman and the 49ers finished the 2012 campaign with an 11-4-1 record, good for second in the NFC. San Francisco took down the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional round of the playoffs in dominating fashion, in which Bowman recorded 6 tackles and 2 pass break-ups. In the following week's NFC Championship game in Atlanta, Bowman had another 2 tackles and a pass break-up, one of which was on the Falcons' most pivotal play of the game. Matt Ryan had led Atlanta downfield for what was shaping up to be a come-from-behind, last-second victory. Bowman's deflection of Ryan's intended pass to Roddy White sealed the 49ers' victory with just over a minute remaining.
NaVorro Bowman's statistics in 2012
2013.
For the third time, Bowman earned First-Team All-Pro honors and was fifth in the league in tackles with 145.
Bowman scored the last touchdown ever at Candlestick Park, intercepting a Matt Ryan pass and returning it 89 yards for a touchdown with just over a minute left.
Bowman and the 49ers finished the 2013 season with a 12-4 record. San Francisco defeated the Green Bay Packers 23-20 in the Wild card round of the playoffs in which Bowman had 10 tackles, and a forced fumble. In the divisional round of the playoffs, San Francisco defeated the Carolina Panthers 23-10 behind a strong performance by Bowman, who recorded 11 tackles and 1 sack. San Francisco played the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game, with the winner gaining the right to represent the conference in Super Bowl XLVIII. However, Bowman's 49ers lost, 23-17. In the fourth quarter of that game, Bowman suffered a serious injury, tearing the ACL and MCL in his left knee.
NaVorro Bowman's statistics in 2013
Personal.
Bowman graduated with a degree in crime, law & justice.
Bowman speaks frequently by phone with former Nittany Lion linebacker LaVar Arrington. The two first met during Arrington's stint with the Washington Redskins, when Bowman was playing at nearby Suitland High School. This friendship, along with their similarity in playing styles, has earned Bowman the nickname "LaVorro".
In 2013, Bowman launched his first annual youth football camp in his hometown of District Heights, Maryland. Bowman who is engaged, is the father of three children.
He is also good friends with Kevin Durant
Media and public appearances.
Bowman made a guest appearance on Spike's "Ink Master Season 3" to pass not a football or a body, but judgment on multiple tattoo artists designs.

<doc id="19426382" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19426382" title="Law enforcement in Mexico">
Law enforcement in Mexico

Law enforcement in Mexico is divided between federal, state, and municipal entities. There are two federal police forces, 31 state police forces (and two for the federal district) and one estimate suggests over 1,600 municipal police forces. There are 366 officers per 100,000 people, The average wage of a police officer is $350 per month, around that of a builder's labourer, which means that many police officers supplement their salaries with bribes. As of 2012, Mexico has a police force of over 544,000 elements, making it the country with the third largest police force in the world, just behind India and the United States.
The government has found it hard to provide police forces with sufficient pay and protection to make it worthwhile resisting the threats and blandishments of drug traffickers, The Federal Investigations Agency itself had replaced the notoriously corrupt Federal Judicial Police ("Policía Judicial Federal", PJF) by the presidential decree of former President Vicente Fox on November 1, 2001. In May 2008, the previous acting chief of the AFI, Édgar Eusebio Millán Gómez, was assassinated.
Federal District Police.
The Secretariat of Public Security of the Federal District (Secretaría de Seguridad
Pública del Distrito Federal – SSP), unlike the previous two, does not have national
reach, but it does manage a combined force of over 90,000 officers in the Federal District
(DF). The SSP is charged with maintaining public order and safety in the center of
Mexico City.
The investigative Judicial Police of the Federal District ("Policía Judicial del Distrito Federal" – PJDF), are organized under the Office of the Attorney General of the DF (the Procuraduría General de Justicia del Distrito Federal). The PGJDF maintains 16 precincts (delegaciones) with an estimated 3,500 judicial police, 1,100 investigating agents for prosecuting attorneys (agentes del ministerio público), and 941 experts or specialists (peritos).
The principal police force of Mexico City is the Protection and Transit Directorate, also known as the Traffic Police, which consists of some 32,000 officers organized into thirty-three precincts. It is the largest single law enforcement organization in Mexico. 
The Bank and Industrial Police of the Ministry of Public Security of the Federal District provides specialized services for the protection, custody and supervision, not just banks and lending institutions, but also dependencies, institutions and government bodies, federal and local, as well as individuals and corporations that require it, with the arrangements put in place.
Mexico City has the second highest crime rate in Latin America. More than 100 serious crimes are reported each day in Mexico City, and on average in the Federal District in the first quarter of 1997 one police officer was killed and one injured weekly. A sense of insecurity prevails among many citizens because of the lack of confidence in the police and the fear of police misbehavior and crime.
Other.
The Secretariat of Government (Secretaría de Gobernación), has Immigration officers who directed by the Mexican Immigration Service, these officers have the right to detain suspected undocumented aliens and, under certain conditions, may deport them without formal deportation proceedings. 
The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, Crédito) Customs officers are deployed at borders and at international airports to interdict contraband entering Mexico. 
The Bank of Mexico (Banco de México) also operates its own security division, which is charged with enforcing banking and monetary laws, including cases of counterfeiting, fraud, and money laundering.
State Police.
Each of the country's thirty-one states maintain both preventive and judicial police called the State Judicial Police. State police are under the direction of the state's governor. The distinction between crimes investigated by State and Federal Judicial Police is not always clear. Most offenses come under the state authorities. Drug dealing, crimes against the government, and offenses involving several jurisdictions are the responsibility of the federal police. The state-level preventive police forces are together perhaps 90,000-strong, and the state-level judicial police perhaps 25,000-strong. 
State police forces operate from precinct stations, called delegaciones with each delegación has an average of 200 police officers attached to it. The ranking officer is known as a comandante, equivalent to a first captain in the military. Most of the remaining personnel hold the ranks of first sergeant, second sergeant, and corporal.
Municipalities.
Some of the municipalities of Mexico have their own preventive and municipal police forces, which are responsible for handling minor civil disturbances and traffic infractions. Of the 2,395 municipalities, 335 have no police forces. However, some of the municipal forces are large and important.
History.
There have historically been multiple government departments with varying levels of responsibility for law enforcement, a situation criticised by experts who suggest that all their functions should be merged into the Public Security Ministry.<ref name="Economist 5/3"/>
Training.
Since 2007, all senior police officers from state and federal forces must complete a common year-long training program. However, training at lower levels remains poor. In some municipalities of Chihuahua, the municipal police have received training from Mexican Army advisors.
Private security.
Mexican security companies have grown significantly in recent years, in response to the state’s failure to provide security. Mexico holds third place world-wide in the purchase of security equipment. Between 1998 and 1999, private security companies increased some
40 percent. The Mexican government has had serious problems in regulating these companies, most of which are illegitimate since they lack the necessary legal permits. It was estimated in 1999, that about 10,000 private security firms operated in Mexico, yet
only 2,000 had some form of official permit. 
According to official figures in December 2000, there were 2,984 private security companies registered with 153,885 employees. The inability to regulate or control these forces creates potential security problem. Since many of these companies are unregulated, some will engage in criminality instead of (or as a means of) protecting their clients, thus exacerbating the problem of insecurity. According to a study by the Mexico City legislative assembly, in 1998 there were more private security guards than police. A substantial number of private security guards were formerly police officers or presently work as security guards while off-duty; these dynamics increase the likelihood of police corruption.

Lamborghini Estoque

The Lamborghini Estoque () is a concept car built by Lamborghini. Unlike current production Lamborghini cars, which are mid-engine two-seat sports cars, the Estoque is a four-door sedan.
The Estoque was introduced at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. The Estoque is the first front-engine vehicle by Lamborghini since the LM002 utility vehicle. It is described as a "concept for a $230,000 four-door sedan". It currently houses a 5.2 litre V10 engine, although there has been speculation that this could be replaced by a V12, V8, or possibly even a hybrid or turbo-diesel engine, as suggested by Lamborghini's Brand Director, Manfred Fitzgerald.
As with other Lamborghinis, the Estoque derives its name from the sport and tradition of bullfighting: An estoque is a type of sword traditionally used by matadors.
Speculation regarding production.
It was reported on 22 March 2009 that production plans for the Lamborghini Estoque were cancelled. Lamborghini executives responded to this by stating that the Estoque had not reached the production planning stage and that the decision whether to produce the Estoque or not has been delayed due to sales and marketing considerations. Stephan Winkelmann, Lamborghini's chairman, has since indicated that a four-door Lamborghini is likely, stating that response to the Estoque showed opportunities for Lamborghini outside the supercar market. However, Winkelmann also stated that Lamborghini does not have any plans to manufacture the Estoque and that it was only a concept vehicle.

Lentokenttä (, English meaning: "airfield") is a district of Vantaa, Finland, in the middle of the city. The district is part of the Tikkurila main district and has been named after the Helsinki-Vantaa Airport situated there.
The district of Lentokenttä is the largest single job concentration of Vantaa. In 2001, the district provided jobs for over 11 thousand people, of which almost 9 thousand worked in customer service. As the airport area has grown, the number of jobs has increased dramatically.
Nowadays only six people live permanently in the district of Lentokenttä, giving it a population density of . In 1980, there were still over 200 people living in the district.
In regard of services, Lentokenttä is fairly self-sufficient, with cafés, restaurants, shops, banks and a bus traffic terminal. The district is secured by its own fire station, deep water supply, water tower and electrical plant. Near the airport, accommodation is available in hotels, and premises for negotiations or conferences are also available. Because of the nature of activity in an international airport, some of the services are only available to passengers having gone through security control.
There are offices of many air traffic carriers, cargo stations and aircraft hangars in the district.
Close to the airport, but outside the district there is:
The Aviapolis job area has recently been built near the airport, in the district of Veromies.
The quietest spots in the district include the Kylmäoja part of the Keravanjoki river located northeast of the airport.

The Douglas XFD was a carrier-based biplane fighter aircraft, the first fighter to be built by Douglas Aircraft Company.
Development.
The XFD was designed to the Bureau of Aeronautics Specification No. 311, requesting a carrier-based two-seat biplane fighter. On June 30, 1932, the Navy ordered the XFD, Vought XF3U, and Curtiss XF12C for testing. The XFD was all metal except for its fabric covering. The crew sat in tandem in a single bay, enclosed by a long canopy. It was fixed gear with a tailwheel. Powered by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp, it first flew in January 1933, and was evaluated by the Navy between June 18, 1933 and August 14, 1934. The XFD performed well, but the Navy had stopped using two-seat fighters; therefore, no orders were received.

Illič-Svityč's law

In linguistics, Illič-Svityč's law refers to two Proto-Slavic rules, named after Vladislav Illich-Svitych who first identified and explained them.
Firstly, Illič-Svityč's law refers to the rule according to which Proto-Slavic thematic neuters accented on the first syllable become masculines. Compare:
This rule is important because it operated after the influx of Proto-Germanic/Gothic thematic neuters, which all became masculines in Proto-Slavic. Late Proto-Germanic (after the operation of Verner's law) had fixed accent on the first syllable. Compare:
Secondly, Illič-Svityč's law refers to the rule according to which all masculine o-stems in Proto-Slavic generalized accentual mobility (accent paradigm 'c', as opposed to expected accent paradigm 'b').
Older literature suggests that this was not a Common Slavic innovation, and that there are exceptions in some Croatian Čakavian dialects of Susak and Istria, which have retained the original accentuation. This has been recently disputed.

Texas, , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that “lthough an affidavit supporting a search warrant may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant, the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances relied on by the person providing the information and some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant, whose identity was not disclosed, was creditable or his information reliable.” Along with "Spinelli v. United States" (1969), "Aguilar" established the Aguilar–Spinelli test, a judicial guideline for evaluating the validity of a search warrant based on information provided by a confidential informant or an anonymous tip.

A Professor Emeritus of Medical Cell Biology at Liverpool University, he is known for his pioneering research in the neurology, biochemistry and physiology of skeletal muscle. In 1969, he "was the first to introduce the design of the buckletype transducer for recording directly in vivo tendon forces in animals." His 1976 work with the implantation of electrical "pacemakers" on rabbit muscles (published in "Nature") clarified the relationship between nerve signals and muscle chemistry.
Life and career.
Salmons was born in Lower Clapton, east London, and was educated at St. Marylebone Grammar School. He was awarded a Royal Scholarship to attend the Imperial College in London, from which he graduated in physics and went on to gain a D.I.C. in Electronics and Communications. Salmons later attended the University College London on a Nuffield Foundation bursary, where he graduated with a Masters Degree in Physiology. He was then appointed to a Research Fellowship in the Department of Anatomy, University of Birmingham, where he subsequently held a Stothert Research Fellowship of the Royal Society. He also worked for a time in the Department of Physiology at Harvard Medical School
He eventually left Birmingham University for the University of Liverpool where he was Professor of Medical Cell Biology from 1987 until 1996 and is now a Professor Emeritus. Salmons gave the 1989 Erasmus Wilson Demonstration at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and has also served as Director of the British Heart Foundation Skeletal Muscle Assist Research Group. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine and was a former President of the International Society on Biotelemetry. He helped found the International Functional Electrical Stimulation Society and is an Honorary Member of the Board of Directors for "Deutsche Gesellschaft für Elektrostimulation und Elektrotherapie".

Rimtutituki

Rimtutituki (Serbian Cyrillic: Римтутитуки; anagram for "Turim ti kitu", trans. "I put my dick in you") was a Serbian rock supergroup featuring Ekatarina Velika, Električni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members. The band was formed as an anti-war project during the Yugoslav Wars. It consisted of Zoran Kostić "Cane" (vocals), Nebojša Antonijević "Anton" (guitar), Borko Petrović (drums), Srđan Gojković "Gile" (guitar, vocals), Goran Čavajda "Čavke" (drums), Zoran Radomirović "Švaba" (bass), Ljubomir Jovanović "Jovec" (guitar) and Milan Mladenović (guitar, vocals).
History.
The band was formed at the petition signing against mobilization in Belgrade. On the meeting appeared Ekatarina Velika, Električni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members and Rambo Amadeus. Čavajda and Kostić suggested forming an anti-war band which was approved by the others. Rambo Amadeus was originally supposed to be the supergroup member, but did not show up at the rehearsals.
At a rehearsal, held without Mladenović, Gojković and Antonijević started working on the music and Kostić, with the help of the other members, on the lyrics which resulted the "Slušaj 'vamo" ("Listen Here") song. Mladenović later added slide guitar and backing vocals. Even though the band had planned to record a long play album, only the single "Slušaj 'vamo" was released, featuring two versions of the track. The songs were recorded for free in the Pink Studio and were released by radio B92 with the PGP-RTS label. A promotional video was recorded for the song which also appeared on the B92 1994 "Radio utopia (1989-1994)" various artists compilation.
The promotion of the single was held on March 2, 1992, at the Cinema museum in Belgrade and the campaign was planned as the media project featuring the "Slušaj 'vamo" single, badges and T-shirts given as a present. The band did not get permission from the authorities to perform live, so they used a truck trailer, driven through the streets of Belgrade, as the stage. For the second performance, the band performed at the Republic Square in Belgrade, this time approved by the authorities. The band presented the anti-war message "S.O.S mir ili ne računajte na nas" ("S.O.S. Peace or Do not Count on Us"). After the concert, the supergroup members split up and continued working with their own bands.
The following year, on September, the band, with Ekatarina Velika, Partibrejkers, and the Zagreb band Vještice, performed in Prague and Berlin on the concerts entitled "Ko to tamo pjeva" ("Who's That Singing Over There"). The band performed several tracks, intended to be the released on the band album, however, since both Ekatarina Velika and Partibrejkers were recording their own albums, the songs were never recorded. One of the tracks, "Keine Macht Den Drogen", appeared on the Električni Orgazam album "Zašto da ne!". After the performance, the band disbanded.
Legacy.
In 2000, "Slušaj 'vamo" was polled No.27 on Rock Express Top 100 Yugoslav Rock Songs of All Times list.
On April 4, 2010, The organization Youth Initiative for Human Rights organized a concert, at the plateau in front of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy, in order to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the Rimtutituki project. On the occasion, the bands Repetitor, Multietnička Atrakcija, Lira Vega, Stuttgart Online and Superkvartet appeared as performers. Superkvartet appeared as a one-off group, consisting of Zoran Radomirović "Švaba" (guitar; Rimtutituki, Električni Orgazam), Aleksandar Grujić "Alex" (keyboards; Lellbach), Miroslav Mišković "Jozzef" (electronics; Jozzef and the Children) and Goran Smiljanić "Smilja" (vocals), who performed a remake of the song "Slušaj 'vamo".

63 Nassau Street

63 Nassau Street is a landmark building located between Fulton and John Streets in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It was built in the Italianate style c.1844, and had its cast-iron facade, attributed to James Bogardus, added in 1857-59, making it one of the first cast-iron buildings in the city. The attribution to Bogardus, a pioneer in the architectural use of cast iron, comes because of medallions of Benjamin Franklin identical to those on four other Bogardus projects, all now demolished. George Washington was also once represented with medallions.
The building is an extremely rare extant example of the work of Bogardus, one of only five known Bogardus buildings in the United States. The building was designated a New York City landmark on May 15, 2007.
Structural detail.
The 5-story, 3-bay Italianate style cast-iron front facade was originally composed of superimposed arcades, with a 2-story arcade capped by an intermediate modillioned foliate cornice, surmounted by a 3-story arcade. The arcades are formed by elongated fluted Corinthian columns (most of the capitals’ leaves are now missing); rope moldings, which also surround the spandrel panels; molded arches with faceted keystones and molded paneled reveals; and foliate spandrels. The ground floor was first altered in 1919.
Between the second and third floors the building featured a series of wreath-encircled portraits of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin cast, like the rest of the facade, in iron. The two portraits of Washington are missing from the facade as of 2008. Similar portraits once appeared on two other Bogardus buildings, the Baltimore Sun building in Baltimore, Maryland, and the New York building of Harper & Brothers. Both of those buildings have been torn down. 
The facade is terminated by a widely-projecting, modillioned foliate cornice supported by a corbel table. Windows were originally two-over-two double-hung wood sash. These were replaced by wood casement windows with transoms prior to 1928 on the upper three stories, and by single-pane windows on the second story during the 1980s. The northern storefront consists of a deeply recessed entrance with glass door and transom,flanking show windows set above recessed bases, and a mosaic tile floor. A metallic signage band extends partially into the second story. The southern metal-and-glass storefront is non-historic, with a fixed awning.

Crooked X

Crooked X was a hard rock band from Coweta, Oklahoma, U.S., consisting of members Kevin Currie (lead vocals/rhythm guitar), Jesse Cooper (lead guitar/backing vocals), Boomer Simpson (drums, backing vocals), and Bradd Johnson (bass guitar). The band is now defunct and has not performed since 2011. They struggled mightily after founding members Forrest French (lead vocals/rhythm guitar) and Josh McDowell (bass guitar) left the band in 2010 to finish high school.
Biography.
The original band was discovered on the CBS morning TV show "The Early Show" when they submitted a video for a segment entitled "Living Room Live" and came in second place. Their success on The Early Show drew the attention of managers Spencer Proffer and Doc McGhee (Kiss, Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi), who signed the band. Crooked X have opened for classic rock acts such as Kiss, Ted Nugent, and Alice Cooper, as well as playing with Black Stone Cherry, Skid Row, and George Bush. On January 15, 2009, they performed a two-song set on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!".
The band gained heavy attention by having their songs featured in the music video game series "Rock Band" - "Nightmare" was first featured in "Rock Band", after which "Rock 'N' Roll Dream" and "Gone", respectively, were made available as downloadable content for the series. Spencer and Doc have produced a TV-special on the band ("Rock N' Roll Dream"), showing the band's progression from four young boys in a garage to ending up in "Rock Band" and opening for Kiss, in front of 35,000 fans in Stockholm, Sweden.
Their first EP, "Till We Bleed", was released on iTunes on October 7, 2008.
Their self-titled debut was released on iTunes on January 27, 2009, the same day the band's special "Rock 'N' Roll Dream", the lead single, aired on MTV.
They toured in the spring of 2009, appearing on the Ernie Ball side stage tour.
However, after all the success, the band parted ways with two original members in June 2010 -- frontman Forrest French, who wrote the majority of the songs, and bassist Josh McDowell. The band auditioned new members and added Kevin Currie to sing and Bradd Johnson to play bass. The change did not go over well with fans of the original band and interest in Crooked X waned. The new incarnation of the band failed to record new music and quit performing in 2011.

Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter

Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter, also known as "The Man Who Hated Laughter", is a 1972 American animated one-hour television movie that was part of "The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie". This film is notable for uniting the characters from almost every newspaper comic strip then owned by King Features Syndicate in one story.
Plot.
Professor Morbid Grimsby is an evil genius who has won the prestigious "Meanie" award six years in a row; to guarantee a seventh, he plots to eliminate all laughter by getting rid of the Sunday funnies, with the aid of his henchman Brutus.
Popeye is given a job as captain of the Professor's yacht, the "SS Hilarious", and all the characters from the humorous comic strips are informed that they have won a free ocean voyage upon this boat. Once out at sea, the boat is pulled to a remote island by the Professor's tractor beam, and in the chaos Popeye's stash of spinach is lost at sea; thus, he and all the passengers are prisoners of the Professor.
Being a huge fan of the Sunday funnies, the President of the United States takes action by calling together the heroes of the adventure comics to rescue the prisoners. Unfortunately, the rescue attempts go wrong, and the adventure characters also end up as prisoners.
The prisoners eventually decide that the only way to free themselves is to make the Professor laugh, to convince him that the world needs laughter. They put on a talent show which fails to have an effect, but then the younger characters get him to laugh by showing him his own reflection in a mirror while he's trying to scare them; the Professor has a change of heart, and decides to let everyone go.
At that moment, however, a volcano on the island begins to erupt; the Professor uses his submarine to get the comic characters off the island, but it gets stuck in an underground cavern. Popeye finds his spinach in the water, eats it, and frees the submarine. The story ends with the comic characters and the Professor being treated to a party on the White House lawn; they're told that the President will join them after he's done enjoying the comics page of his newspaper.

Pinch point (mathematics)

In geometry, a pinch point or cuspidal point is a type of singular point on an algebraic surface.
The equation for the surface near a pinch point may be put in the form
where denotes terms of degree 4 or more and formula_2 is not a square in the ring of functions.
For example the surface formula_3 near the point formula_4, meaning in coordinates vanishing at that point, has the form above. In fact, if formula_5 and formula_6 then {formula_7} is a system of coordinates vanishing at formula_4 then formula_9 is written in the canonical form.
The simplest example of a pinch point is the hypersurface defined by the equation formula_10 called Whitney umbrella. 
The pinch point (in this case the origin) is a limit of normal crossings singular points (the formula_2-axis in this case). These singular points are intimately related in the sense that in order to resolve the pinch point singularity one must blow-up the whole formula_2-axis and not only the pinch point.

Indigo Listen

Indigo Listen was an electronic band based in Bristol in the 1980s.
Originally (1983) the band had only two members, Ally Patterson-Fox vocals and Neil Bailey guitars and synthesizers. In the duo days the band was simply known as 'Listen' and they performed live with the aid of backing tapes in local venues. In 1984 Steve Thomas was brought in as keyboard player. Thomas was very different from the existing members and considered slightly wild . Thomas's songwriting skills changed the direction of the music towards dance music. The live performances consisted of: Thomas playing synthesizers, drum programming and bass; Bailey on guitar; and Patterson-Fox vocals. By 1985 the band were pulling in large audiences at all the best local venues.
At this point the band decided to use a live drummer - John Furlong. Furlong proved that he could outperform the best digital drum technology and the high energy music remained. The band released their first single 'Whatever' in 1985 which was featured on the Radio 1 John Peel show.
Late 1985 and 1986 the band change the name to Indigo Listen and they started headlining at the major gigs. Unlikely gigs happened (such as support band for King Kurt on the Cocking All Over the World tour) and venues such as Ashton Court Festival and Glastonbury Festival. Johnnie Walker introduced Indigo Listen live on stage at The Thekla in July 1986 as 'an amazing and original bunch of musicians'. However, at this time band members were to keen to explore other styles and amicably went their own ways.

The assignment was considered very difficult by the Pakistan High Military Command, and many senior officers from the Pakistan Armed Forces were reluctant to accept appointments in East Pakistan. The crises in East Pakistan was at its peak and situation was deteriorated under the Military administration of Major-General Muzaffaruddin. By tradition, the Chiefs of the respective Armed services were expected to retired from their services once they had complete their tenure, but in this case Syed Mohammad Ahsan was appointed to the province as a serving uniformed admiral. However, the situation in East Pakistan was at critical point, and Military Government wanted an administrator with a good reputation in the province. Therefore, Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan's service was extended and he was given a command assignment that was considered very difficult. On 1 September 1969, Admiral Ahsan arrived, in his uniform, in East Pakistan and assumed the control of the East. He was also unified commander of the Pakistan Combatant Forces with both political and military powers. As military administrator of East Pakistan, Admiral S.M. Ahsan tried to solve the East Pakistan crisis politically, often meeting General Yahya Khan, and the political leadership of both East and West Pakistan. While he was military administrator, the country had been in turmoil with riots and disturbances in East and West Pakistan against the rule of former President Field Marshal Ayub Khan.
Reasoning with East-Pakistan Disaster.
It was in this charged atmosphere that parliamentary elections were held in the country in December 1970. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s People's League was the clear victor having secured more than 39.2% of the seats in the Parliament. The outcomes were a shock to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who ended up with around 18.6% of the seats — all from West Pakistan. Therefore, Bhutto refused to accept a coalition government led by Prime minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman which led to the disastrous action by Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan, and the eventual independence of Bangladesh after the Indian invasion in December 1971. Mujib put pressure on the Pakistan Armed Forces, and was aided by an anti-Yahya Khan movement in both contingents. The high military commanders advocated armed action in East Pakistan.
In February 1971, Admiral Ahsan attended the high level government meeting chaired by Chief Martial Law Administrator General Yahya Khan. There was another meeting, which Admiral Ahsan described as "tense", where the atmosphere was highly "anti-bengali", with no representation from East Pakistan in the policy and decision-making. Admiral Ahsan opposed any military armed action in East Pakistan, when he was asked on the situation. Admiral Ahsan was the only naval officer in the meeting which was full of Army and Air Force's generals. Because of his continuous objections to the planned military plan, Admiral Ahsan became highly unpopular and his counterparts and colleagues called him "difficult" at best and "sold to the Bengalis" at worst. On February 22, 1971, Admiral Ahsan attended the last meeting over the issue of the East Pakistan. And, Chief Martial Law Administrator General Yahya Khan ordered his commanders in Pakistan Army, Air Force and Navy, to launch an extreme military action to curb the resistance, despite repeated calls made by Admiral Ahsan to prevent any military operation. Disheartened and isolated by his colleagues, Admiral Ahsan returned to East Pakistan to pick up his personal belongings. On March 7, Admiral Ahsan resigned, in protest, from his position as Martial Law Administrator, and also resigned from his position as the Unified Commander of Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan. He immediately returned to Karachi where he took honorary early retirement from Pakistan Navy, and permanently settled in Karachi. In an article titled "A nation's shame" published in the "Newsline magazine" of September 2000, the Admiral Ahsan concluded:
"But who was responsible for creating this hostile atmosphere and hatred among the people? The situation deteriorated further after General Yahya Khan postponed the first session of the newly elected constituent assembly. It became very clear immediately after the election results that the generals were not prepared to transfer power to the Awami League. First the delay in summoning the National Assembly session and later its postponement confirmed the Bengalis' worst fears, that the election results were not acceptable both to the generals and to the majority of West Pakistani politicians. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto publicly called for a boycott of the assembly session. Such a transgression was bound to further fuel public resentment".
Resignation.
After returning to East-Pakistan, the Pakistan Armed Forces were already preparing to conduct a military operation to curb the movement. Admiral Ahsan learned that the Central Military government had decided to undertake an operation in East-Pakistan, despite what Admiral Ahsan had recommended in the meeting. When it became apparent and inevitable that an armed operation would take place, Admiral Ahsan resigned, in protest, from his position as Martial Law Administrator and Unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan on 7 March 1971, less than three weeks before the military action. Admiral Ahsan did not waste a moment to stay in Eastern Military High Command's Headquarter in Dacca, and immediately flew to Karachi, West-Pakistan. Upon Ahsan's return to Karachi, he reported to Naval Combatant Headquarters, NHQ, in Karachi. Therefore, he received honorary retirement from the navy. He permanently settled in Karachi, and did not speak a word during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani "Winter war".
Hamoodur Rehman Commission.
After the disastrous war, Admiral Ahsan attended a Government Commission, headed by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman. There, Admiral Ahsan famously made a statement and aptly described the hostile mood of the military leadership when they decided to postpone the assembly session and launch a military operation in the eastern province. Admiral Ahsan publicly stated:
On arrival in Rawalpindi I was alarmed to notice the high tide of militarism flowing turbulently... There was open talk of a military solution according to plan , maintained Admiral Ahsan. I was caught quite unaware in this atmosphere for I know of no military solution which could possibly solve whatever crisis was supposed to be impending in the minds of the authorities. It was evident from the statement that the decision to launch a military operation was taken without consulting the governor of East Pakistan who was the only sane voice in the government. Ahsan went on to describe the atmosphere at a crucial high-level meeting in Rawalpindi on February 22, 1971.
The president presided over the meeting of the governors and martial law administrators attended as usual by the military and the civilian officers of the intelligence agencies. It is relevant to record that among the tribe of governors and MLAs I was the only non-army governor and the only active naval officer in the midst of active service men. I was the only person, though a non-Bengali, who had to represent the sentiments of seventy million Bengalis to a completely West Pakistani high command. During the past 17 months, in meetings and conferences, my brief ran counter to the cut-and-dried solutions of West Pakistan representatives and civil servants. The president invariably gave decisions which accommodated East Pakistan's viewpoint, at least partially. This made me unpopular with my colleagues who probably thought I was 'difficult' at best and 'sold' to the Bengalis at worst.
Legacy.
After his retirement from Navy, Admiral Ahsan remained one of the notable Chief of Naval Staff of Pakistan Navy, with introducing more war programmes and educational programmes for the naval cadets. Because of his respected public image, Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto made him the Chairman of the National Shipping Corporation in 1975 which he kept his position in 1976. During the military reign of Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Admiral Ahsan played a major and influential role in Ayub Khan's decision on both political and military affairs. Served as the ADC to Jinnah and Mountbatten, Admiral Ahsan strongly believed in state secularism, unity of cultures and race, non-discrimination policies, therefore, he advised Khan to promote his policies toward the secularism and progressive aspect. Admiral Ahsan rose to be country's second powerful man, with influencing Ayub Khan's major military decisions. Admiral Ahsan also played an influential and major role in Ayub Khan's policy that sidelined hardline Islamist, and diminished their political role in the public society.
However, Admiral Ahsan is most credited for founding Port Qasim - Pakistan's second port after exploring the coast around Phitti Creek in the 1966 and convincing Mr. Bhutto, President that time, in 1972 to locate the port there. Admiral Ahsan's years immediately preceding his death were quiet ones, and was put out of public eye during his last years. During his last years, Admiral Ahsan learned French and played bridge. On December 4, 1989, Admiral Ahsan peacefully died at home during the midnight. He was given an honorary Guard of honor, and burial with Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey, and Chiefs of Staff of Army, Navy, and Air Force, and among others attended his funeral, and is buried at Karachi Military Graveyard.
Honors.
For his services and honors, Pakistan Navy, in the honor and recognition of Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, commissioned an intelligence and naval base on 30 October 1991, known as Ahsan Naval Base. The base was given commissioned by Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Yastur-ul-Haq Malik. On 4 August 1989, the main channel of the Port Muhammad Bin Qasim bears his name, as it known as Ahsan Industrial Terminal. While inaugurating the channel, former Prime minister Benazir Bhutto acknowledged Admiral Ahsan's as the founder of Port Qasim at a speech on the occasion of the opening of a new terminal at Port Qasim on 4 August 1989.

254-260 Canal Street

254-260 Canal Street, also known as the Bruce Building, on the corner of Lafayette Street in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1856-57 and was designed in the Italian Renaissance revival style. The cast iron elements of the facade may have been provided by James Bogardus, a pioneer in the use of cast iron in architecture. The building was constructed for George Bruce, a prosperous printer and inventor of new technologies in the printing industry, which was then one of New York's leading industries. It was converted to offices in 1987 by architect Jack L. Gordon.
The use of cast iron columns in the large, five-story tall building enabled the installation of large windows that improved manufacturing conditions and efficiency. The lot had become available because a lumber mill standing on the site had recently been destroyed by fire, making fire-retardant cast iron construction attractive. The mildly Italinate style of the building, makes it a particularly handsome example of nineteenth century industrial architecture. It has been called "Beautiful!" and "an important early example of cast-iron architecture in New York City". If the cast iron did in fact come from Bogardus' iron works, the building would be "the largest and most important of his extant works."
The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1985, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

Lambeth Waterworks Company

The Lambeth Waterworks Company was a utility company supplying water to parts of south London in England. The company was established in 1785 with works in north Lambeth and became part of the publicly owned Metropolitan Water Board in 1903.
Origins.
The Lambeth Waterworks Company, founded in 1785 to supply water to south and west London, established premises on the south bank of the River Thames close to the present site of Hungerford Bridge where the Royal Festival Hall now stands. The Company's first water-intake lay on the south side of the river, supplied directly from the river. After complaints that the water was foul, the intake was moved to the middle of the river. The Company expanded to supply Kennington in 1802 and about this time replaced its wooden pipes with iron ones.
Infrastructure.
In 1832 the company built a reservoir at Streatham Hill, and in 1834 obtained an Act of Parliament to extend its area of supply. In the same year the company purchased of land in Brixton and built a reservoir and works on Brixton Hill adjacent to Brixton Prison. In the 1850s the quality of drinking water became a matter of public concern. John Snow examined the state of waters in 1849. Parliament passed the Metropolis Water Act 1852 to "make provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water". Under the Act, it became unlawful for any water company to extract water for domestic use from the tidal reaches of the Thames after 31 August 1855, and from 31 December 1855 all such water was required to be "effectually filtered". The directors had already decided in 1847 to move the intake for their reservoirs to Seething Wells, between Surbiton and Thames Ditton and between Molesey Lock and Teddington Lock. The facilities were completed in 1852 and the Lambeth was joined there taking advantage of its pipes to the city by the Chelsea Waterworks Company. However the inlets pumped in too much silt with the water because of turbulence caused by the discharge (confluence) of the River Mole/Ember and The Rythe into the Thames immediately upstream. The Lambeth Waterworks Company moved upstream to Molesey between Sunbury and Molesey Locks, where they built the Molesey Reservoirs in 1872 and the Chelsea Waterworks Company followed them there three years later.

Chili Bowl (race)

The Chili Bowl Midget Nationals is an indoor midget car racing event. It takes place at the Tulsa Expo Center in January, two weeks after Christmas. NASCAR calls it the "biggest Midget race of the year". It is nicknamed the "Super Bowl of midget racing".
History.
The inaugural Chili Bowl is organized by Emmett Hahn and Lanny Edwards. It was named after a local company who sponsored the first event. The race has been hosted at the Tulsa Expo Center since it was founded in 1987. The 1994 event featured a three-wide battle for the lead between Jones brothers, P. J. and Page and eventual winner Andy Hillenburg from nearby Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.
Event.
The inaugural 1987 event consisted of 52 midgets competing in the 2-day event. The event now consists of four days of qualifiers for the Saturday night A-main event. One third of the drivers compete in each qualifying night's event, attempting to qualify for the A-main. Each qualifying night has heat races, dash-type events, and a 25 lap feature. Drivers who finish poorly in their heat event in their qualifying night start deep in final night qualifying events and have to finish high in many events to make the A-main field. A driver who started in the lowest "J" event would have to finish high in I, H, G, F, E, D, C, and B events to reach the A-main. The Top 4 finishers in the qualifying night's feature event plus the top 4 finishers the two Saturday night B-main events progress into the 24 car feature field.
The cable channel Speed Channel has televised the event in the United States. The 2008 Saturday night main event was televised on HBO On Demand. It featured a record 286 entries. The National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame uses the event to induct its next class of members.
Facility.
The event is held at the Tulsa Expo Center (now called the River Spirit Expo), the home of The Golden Driller. It accommodates hundreds of race cars, bleachers for 15,000 fans, and a trade show, all under one roof.
The clay which once covered the adjacent fairgrounds is used for the event. The quarter mile indoor track is not affected by adverse weather or drying from the wind or sun.
Drivers.
Drivers in other series who come from a midget car background frequently race in the event. The 2007 competitors included NASCAR drivers Tony Stewart, Justin Allgaier, J. J. Yeley, A. J. Fike, Josh Wise, Kasey Kahne, and Jason Leffler, World of Outlaws sprint car drivers Terry McCarl, Tim McCreadie, Danny Lasoski, and Sammy Swindell, NHRA drag racing champions Cruz Pedregon and Gary Scelzi, IndyCar drivers A. J. Foyt IV, Tom Bigelow and Billy Boat, and numerous USAC racers. Drivers in 2008 came from 29 American states, Canada, and Australia.
NASCAR driver Tony Stewart, a two-time winner of the event, said, This is the only place that you can take the best Midget drivers from USAC and ], and guys in the Rocky Mountain Midget Association, guys from USAC Sprint Cars and Silver Crown Cars and the World of Outlaws, all the best in dirt open-wheel racing. Those drivers are all at one place for the weekend, and when you've got those guys competing for just the 24 starting spots in the A-Main, you have some of the best racing that you're going see all year all in one week at the Chili Bowl.
USAC Triple Crown winner Dave Darland said, "You've got guys from all over the world. New Zealand, Australia, NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Cars -- you know, there's just all sorts of different competition there, all sots of different levels of drivers."
List of A-Main Winners.
The A-Main feature is a 50 lap event. Drivers with multiple wins include five-time winner Sammy Swindell, Sammy's son Kevin Swindell with four wins, and two-time winners Dan Boorse, Tony Stewart, and Cory Kruseman. The winning driver wins a trophy dubbed the "Golden Driller" after the statue outside the building.

Jain literature

Canonical.
Origin.
According to the tradition, the canonical literature originated from the first "tirthankara" Adinatha. It was forgotten and revived from time to time by "tirthankara" succeeding adinatha. The last "tirthankara" Mahavira's teachings was recorded in twelve sections known as "anga". The last part contains the teachings of fourteen earlier works called "purva". A council was formed c. 300 BCE at Patliputra for compilation of the scriptures. However the last Anga was unknown to everyone. So jain monks were sent to Bhadrabahu to retrieve it. Bhadrabahu was a "sutra-kevali" according to Jain tradition. "Sutra-kevali" are individuals who had memorised all jain scriptures and could recite them out of memory. Of the whole delegation, only Sthulabhadra, a jain monk learnt the "purva", while the others found themselves incapable of receiving the knowledge. However, Bhadrabahu did not allow stutabhadra to teach the last four purva to anyone. The knowledge of ten "purva" were passed on heriditarily up to seven generations of the teachers before it was lost permanently. The Vallabhi council was commissioned in c. 5th century CE to write down the scriptures. The council was headed by Devarddhi. The scriptures compiled by this council forms the canonical texts of the swetambara "svetambara" sect. The "digambara" sect of Jainism share the opinion that Bhadrabahu knew the scriptures. However, according to the "digambara" tradition, the knowledge of the twelve "anga" were also lost along with the fourteen "purva". Svetambara sect thus claim to have the correct but incomplete canonical literature where as texts written in a later period guides the principles of the "digambara".
Svetambara.
The svetambara canonical literature consists of forty-five texts. These are eleven "anga", twelve "upanga", ten "prakrina", six "chedasutra", two "sutra" and four "mulasutra". Further, svetambara also have "niyukti" and other works which are added to these forty-five texts. The holy texts of svetambara thus comes to around eighty-four. There are also thirty-six "nigama" which serves as a supplement to "agama". There are some branches within svetambara sect which do not regard all these texts as authoritative. For instance, the "sthanakavasi" sect regards only thirty-two of these as their holy books.
Non-Canonical.
Theological.
Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) is considered by the jains as last "sutra-kevali" (one who has memorized all the scriptures). He wrote various books known as "niyukti", which are commentaries on those scriptures. He also wrote "Samhita", a book dealing with legal cases. Umaswati (c. 1st century CE) wrote "Tattvarthadhigama-sutra" which briefly describes all the basic tennets of Jainism. Siddhasena Divakara (c. 650 CE), a contemporary of Vikramaditya, wrote "Nyayavatra" a work on pure logic. Haribhadra Suri (c. 1088-1072 CE) wrote "Yogasastra", a textbook on yoga and "Adhatma Upanishad". His minor work "Vitragastuti" gives outlines of the Jaina doctrine in form of hyms. This was later detailed by Mallisena (c. 1292 CE) in his work "Syadavadamanjari". Devendrasuri wrote "Karmagrantha" which discuss the theory of Karma in Jainism. Gunaratna (c. 1400 CE) gave a commentary on Haribhadra's work. Dharmasagara (c. 1573) wrote "kaupaksakausi-kasahasrakirana" (Sun for the owls of the false doctrine). In this work he wrote against the Digambara sect of Jainism. "Lokaprakasa" of Vinayavijaya and "pratimasataka" of Yasovijaya were written in c. 17th century CE. "Lokaprakasa" deals with all aspects of Jainism. "Pratimasataka" deals with metaphysics and logic. Yasovijaya defends idol-worshiping in this work. A recent work on Jaina theology is "Jainatattvajnana" written by Vijay Dharma Suri in 1917 CE. Srivarddhaeva (aka Tumbuluracarya) wrote a Kannada commentary on "Tattvarthadigama-sutra". This work has 96000 verses. This work is praised in various inscriptions but it is lost. "Jainendra-vyakarana" of Pujyapada Devanandi and "Sakatayana-vyakarana" of Sakatayana are the works on grammar written in c. 9th century CE. "Siddhahemacandra" by Hemacandra (c. 12th century CE) is considered by F. Kielhorn as the best grammar work of the Indian middle age. Hemacandra's book "Kumarapalacaritra" is also noteworthy.
Narrative literature and poetry.
Jaina narrative literature mainly contains stories about sixty-three prominent figures known as "Salakapurusa", and people who were related to them. Some of the important works are "Harivamshapurana" of Jinasena (c. 8th century CE), Vikramarjuna-Vijaya (also known as Pampa-Bharata) of Kannada poet named Adi Pampa (c. 10th century CE), "Pandavapurana" of Shubhachandra (c. 16th century CE). "Paumacariya" of Vimalasuri (c. 3rd or 4th century CE), "Padma-purana" of Ravisena (c. 660 CE) and "Ramacandra-caritrapurana" (also known as "Pampa-Ramayana") of Pampa II (c. 1100 CE) have the stories of the legendary figure Rama.
Inscriptions.
Jain inscription usually starts with the words "Om! Svasti! Sri".

George Bruce (industrialist)

George Bruce (July 5, 1781 – July 6, 1866) was an American printer, industrialist and inventor.
Bruce, who was born in Scotland, immigrated to America in 1795 and served his apprenticeship in Philadelphia. After first apprenticing to a bookbinder, his brother David arranged for him an apprenticeship with Thomas Dobson, printer in Philadelphia. In 1798 the destruction of Dobson's office by fire, and the prevalence of yellow fever, led the brothers to leave the city. George had yellow fever at Amboy, but recovered through his brother's care. The two went to Albany and obtained employment there, but after a few months returned to New York. 
In 1803 young Bruce was foreman and a contributor to the "Daily Advertiser", and in November of that year printer and publisher of the paper for the proprietor. In 1806 the two brothers opened a book printing office at the corner of Pearl street and Coffeehouse slip. The same year they brought out an edition of "Lavoisier's Chemistry", doing all the work with their own hands. Their industry and personal attention to business soon brought them abundant employment, and in 1809, moving to Sloat lane, near Hanover square, they had nine presses in operation, and published occasionally on their own account. 
In 1812 David went to England, and brought back with him the secret of stereotyping. The brothers attempted to introduce the process, but encountered many difficulties, which it required all their ingenuity to surmount. The type of that day was cast with so low a beveled shoulder that it was not suitable for stereotyping, as it interfered with the molding and weakened the plate. They found it necessary, therefore, to cast their own type. They invented a planing-machine for smoothing the backs of the plates and reducing them to a uniform thickness, and the mahogany shifting-blocks to bring the plates to the same height as type. Their first stereotype works were school editions of the New Testament in bourgeois, and the Bible in nonpareil (1814 and 1815). They subsequently stereotyped the earlier issues of the American Bible society, and a series of Latin classics. 
In 1816 they sold out the printing business, and bought a building in Eldridge street for their foundry. Here, and subsequently in 1818, when they erected the type foundry still occupied by their successors in Chambers street, George gave his attention to the enlargement and development of the type-founding business, while David confined his labors to stereotyping. In 1822 David's health failed, and the partnership was dissolved. George soon relinquished stereotyping', and gave his whole attention to type-founding, and introduced valuable improvements into the business, cutting his own punches, making constantly new and tasteful designs, and graduating the size of the body of the type so as to give it a proper relative proportion to the size of the letter. In connection with his nephew, David Bruce, Jr., he invented a typecasting machine that grew to be widely used in the industry. His scripts became famous among printers as early as 1832, and retained their pre-eminence for a generation. The last set of punches he cut was for a great primer script. He was at the time in his seventy-eighth year, but for beauty of design and neatness of finish, the type in question has rarely been excelled.
Mr. Bruce was a man of large benevolence, of unflinching integrity, and great decision of character. He was president for many years of the Mechanics' institute, and of the type-founders' association, and an active member of. and contributor to, the historical society, St. Andrew's society, the typographical society, and the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York. 
In 1856 he commissioned architect James Bogardus to build 254 Canal Street, one of the earliest as well as one of the most handsome examples of cast-iron architecture.

Sean O'Dwyer (artist)

Sean O'Dwyer (b. December 4, 1964) is an Irish painter and sculptor.
Sean O'Dwyer was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary and educated in Dublin. He studied at the National College of Art and Design, graduating in 1989 with a Higher Diploma in Art & Design. In 1990, he co-founded Artsquad, a government-sponsored initiative that enables artists to create work on behalf of Dublin-based community groups and voluntary organisations.[http://cityartsquad.com/]
O'Dwyer received his first public commission in 1995 from Fingal County Council. This led to the creation of "The Ready Boat Pillar", a 4-metre tall granite sculpture located in the fishing village of Howth, Co. Dublin. The piece features 12 sculpted relief panels depicting scenes from Howth's history and it was unveiled by broadcaster, Gay Byrne, in September 1996.
In 2001, O'Dwyer moved to Drogheda, County Louth and has since been described as one of the town's "most talented, prolific and controversial artists". His painting, "The Miracle Ship", became the subject of controversy in 2007 when a local politician described the work as "a vision of ignorance". The painting was inspired by a local folk-tale which suggests that a Turkish ship brought aid from the Ottoman Empire to the starving citizens of Drogheda during the Great Famine. The dispute reached the national airwaves when O'Dwyer was invited to defend his artistic integrity on RTÉ Radio 1's live phone in programme, "Liveline". 
O'Dwyer is married with three children and continues to paint and sculpt. He also devotes some of his time to teaching a small number of students.

Susan's son M.J. is suffering at the hands of a bully, but he did not want to tell who is bullying him. Later Susan saw Gaby's daughter, Juanita pushing him after she grabbed his ball. Susan asks Gaby to have a word with her daughter but a simple request turns unpleasant when they start insulting each others' children. In the meantime, Susan prepares M.J. to face bullies by asking Mike to teach him to fight (who insists he doesn't condone fighting with girls) and giving him a whistle. When Juanita pushes M.J. down the next time around, Susan retaliates by doing the same to Juanita to show her how it feels. As Gaby observes this, she goes over to Susan and they engage in argument which then turns into a cat fight between the women. Susan apologizes with a bottle of Vodka and the women talk, both highlighting their problems, Gaby losing her extravagant lifestyle due to Carlos losing his sight and subsequently his job, and Susan having another failed marriage and having trouble raising her new son, they both say to each other they are doing fine and are both good mothers.
Gaby loses the last part of her glamorous life, her Aston Martin to a rich couple as a gift to their nanny.

Dave stumbles across Tom who is clearing out the garage with Lynette. Lynette criticizes Tom for not throwing more useless items out. Dave then uncovers Tom's old bass guitar and suggests to start a garage band. Tom agreed and they both start playing together, much to Lynette's discomfort. In order to get him to stop, Lynette leaves his guitar in the middle of the garage, leaving Penny's doll next to it so she has to take the blame when Tom runs over it with the car. Dave later drops by with a new guitar to give to Tom. When Lynette disagrees again, Dave reveals to her the truth of a mid-life crisis which Tom is experiencing, and he wishes to fulfill his dreams. Struck by these home truths, Lynette takes the guitar and gives it to Tom as a present from her. When Dave sees this, we're told that he has in fact just taken advantage of them, but we're not told why.
Mrs. McCluskey, still suspicious of Dave, joins with Katherine to discover more about him. Katherine can't find anything over the Internet about him as they have very little information about him. So they invite Edie for lunch to fish some details about Dave. Mrs. McCluskey very blatantly asks questions about Dave's past, but even Edie doesn't know herself. At Danielle's welcome home dinner, Katherine subtly steers the conversation back to Dave's past asking where he went to college. When Dave is reluctant to answer, Edie continues questioning him. Dave claims that he comes from "the mid-west", a reference to the novel The Great Gatsby. Dave tells the others he didn't go to college and that his dad had drinking problems. Edie later apologizes when they reach home, and she blames her questioning him on Mrs. McCluskey's keen interest. Aware that she's trying to suss him out, Dave feeds the idea into Edie's head that Mrs. McCluskey may be starting to go senile.

Man Against Crime

Man Against Crime (also known as Follow That Man), one of the first television programs about private eyes, ran on CBS, the DuMont Television Network and NBC from October 7, 1949 to August 26, 1956. The show was created by Lawrence Klee and was broadcast live until 1952. The series was one of the few television programs ever to have been simulcast on more than one network: the program aired on both NBC and DuMont during the 1953-1954 television season.
Synopsis.
"Man Against Crime" starred Ralph Bellamy as Mike Barnett, a New York freelance private eye. In the 1951 season, Robert Preston co-starred as Mike Barnett's brother, Pat (who also assumed the lead while Bellamy was on vacation that summer). In the summer of 1956, Frank Lovejoy took over the role of Mike Barnett until the series' end that same year. 
Accompanied by a frantic theme song by Fred Steiner, the film noir-style introduction features an unknown man running down a deserted New York City street while being chased by a black car, all of which is viewed from above. As he knocks on Barnett's door, there is a spray of sub-machine gun fire, and the man is killed. Barnett opens the door, hears the click of the bolt on the gun, ducks and is missed by a second, shorter burst of slugs. Barnett then takes off after the killer while "Follow That Man" appears in bold letters and the title of the episode is shown on a file folder that is propped up against a telephone. The filmed episodes were syndicated as Follow That Man because the sponsor owned the original title below. 
The show's first prime-time episode aired on CBS on 7 October 1949, and the final prime-time episode was broadcast, on NBC, on 26 August 1956.
Filming.
Interior filming was done at the Bedford Park Studios in New York City, while exteriors were filmed in Manhattan and NYC's other boroughs, as well as in Washington, D.C. ("The Washington Story"), and Pennsylvania.
Sponsorship.
The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (Camel cigarettes) sponsored the series, as well as holding a monetary share in the program and a copyright on the series. Mike Barnett was frequently shown smoking a cigarette (and occasionally flashing a pack at the camera), and at the conclusion of the program, Ralph Bellamy would put on reading glasses and read a list of veterans' hospitals and military bases to which "the makers of Camels" was donating cigarettes that week.
DVD release.
There were eighty-four filmed episodes (seasons 4 and 5), of which twenty-eight are available on DVD.

Ulster Heights Synagogue

Ulster Heights Synagogue, formally known as Congregation Knesset Israel of Ulster Heights, is located at the corner of Beaverdam and Ulster Heights roads in the Ulster Heights section of the town of Wawarsing, New York, United States. It was built in 1924 by the early Jewish settlers of the southeastern Catskill region. In 2001 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a relatively intact example of a vernacular rural synagogue typical of the region.
Since its construction the building has been renovated and added to but it is still true to its original form. Over the years the original population of the area has dwindled and it has fewer members than it did in the early years. It still holds services on the High Holy Days.
Building.
The synagogue is a one-story three-by-three-bay structure, with a newer wing to the west, sided in white vinyl, which replaced the original clapboard. It was built of wood frame with a fieldstone and mortar foundation. The roof is gabled and shingled in asphalt. On three sides the roof has a deep cornice with returns; the front gable is parapeted.
A single brick chimney comes up through the rear. The front entrance has a slightly raised portico
The interior consists of a small vestibule leading into the auditorium, where the ark is on the rear and pews surround the bimah on three sides. A wide hallway leads into the new wing, used as a community center.
Originally the synagogue's interior was very plain. Some decorative touches such as a chandelier in the auditorium and a wrought-iron railing around the bimah, have been added since its construction.
History.
Jews from Eastern Europe began settling in the Catskills starting in 1900. The area of Ulster and Sullivan counties due west of Ellenville and Kerhonkson became a popular destination. One of these areas was Ulster Heights, in the western highlands of the Town of Wawarsing, near the Sullivan County line.
The Jews who settled here and managed to make a living dairy and poultry farming the difficult, rocky soil were unusual in that they continued as a farming community, instead of gradually becoming a resort area like many other Jewish enclaves in the region. They held prayer services in their homes at first, gradually settling on Samuel Tannenbaum's hotel/boarding house as more families arrived.
From 1908 on the group had wanted to build its own meeting place, but only in 1922 had it raised enough money to purchase the land. A foundation was built shortly afterwards, but the lumber turned out to be rotten and the group soon had just an empty hole. Samuel Kaufman, a lawyer who vacationed nearby, decided to help raise money and by the end of that summer had secured enough from resort owners for the congregation to start building again. Ulster Heights Synagogue was formally opened with Passover services in 1924.
It would remain the focal point of the small community for the next two decades. As the children of the early settlers began moving elsewhere in the years after World War II, it declined until a young couple, Morris and Celia Rubin, led an effort that not only reversed that trend but renovated the building, adding its ark, chandelier and other interior decor, and building the portico new wing and residing the structure. Many of these changes had the effect of making Ulster Heights more like the other rural synagogues in the area.
At the end of the 20th century, the congregation still had around 30 members, mainly descendants of the original founding families. It continues to hold services every year on the High Holy Days.
The small cemetery for the synagogue is on Briggs Highway in Ulster Heights.

Levasseur PL.7

The Levasseur PL.7 was a torpedo bomber developed in France in the late 1920s. It was a development of Levasseur's PL.4 reconnaissance aircraft and intended to replace their PL.2 then in service with the Aéronavale. It was a single-bay sesquiplane of largely conventional design, but incorporating safety features for naval operation, including jetissonable main undercarriage units, a watertight, boat-shaped fuselage, and small floats on the undersides of the lower wings.
The first flight was in 1928, and during testing, aspects of the design underwent fine-tuning, including engine choice and the design of the wing struts and tail fin. Eventually presented to the Navy, an order for 15 aircraft was placed in 1929. However, the Navy had reservations about the wing design, and ordered five of these machines to be delivered with their spans shortened from the original down to and built to different wing areas, and a sixth machine with its span shortened to . These miscellaneous types were all put into service together aboard the carrier "Béarn" in July 1930. After testing, one of the 16.50 m wing designs was selected as the standard, and 30 new aircraft were ordered with this wing. Ten of the existing PL.7s were also thus modified.
The PL.7s were grounded in July 1931 after two aircraft had disintegrated in flight, losses that were attributed to vibration problems. They were returned to service in September 1932 having reinforced wing bracing and engine mounts, and new three-bladed metal propellers. In 1934, they were relegated to shore duties, but were put aboard the "Béarn" again in 1936, where they were still in service (albeit now thoroughly obsolete) at the outbreak of the Second World War.
Levasseur displayed an aircraft at the 1926 "Salon de l'Aéronautique" dubbed the PL.7T (for "transport") and promoted as an airliner. This was fitted with a Gnome et Rhône-built Bristol Jupiter engine and had a revised fuselage with side-by-side seating for a pilot and mechanic and enclosed cabin for six passengers. This, however, was merely a PL.4 specially modified for the show. It was scrapped immediately afterwards, never having flown.

Riccardoella limacum

Riccardoella limacum or the slug mite is a member of the Acari (mite) family which is parasitic on slugs and snails. Slug mites are very small (less than 0.5 mm in length), white, and can be seen to move very rapidly over the surface of their host, particularly under the shell rim and near the pulmonary aperture. While once thought to be benign mucophages, more recent studies have shown that they actually subsist on the host's blood, and may bore into the host's body to feed.
Hosts.
Mite infection among gastropod populations varies greatly. Dense gastropod population favors infection; isolated populations may remain uninfected. Older and larger gastropods are more likely to show infection. Mites have been observed to move from host to host when hosts mate, and when gastropods congregate in moist soil and under rocks during the day. It has been shown that mites move preferentially towards fresh mucus when they travel along mucus, enabling them to follow mucus trails to new hosts.
Once infected, individual gastropods take longer to mature and show reduced mating, activity, and feeding. Infected slugs and snails lay fewer eggs than uninfected individuals. Infected gastropods also show decreased winter survival rates.
At least 31 species of mollusks are exploited. Common hosts include the following:
Taxonomy.
The slug mite was first identified in 1710 by entomologist René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur. Three species were subsequently named, though they were synonymized as "Riccardoella limacum" in 1946.
Life cycle.
Slug mites are a one-host mite. It is possible for a mite to be born, live, and die on a single host. 
Mites have two sexes. Their five-stage life cycle is as follows: Females lay eggs in the host lung, and then the eggs hatch in 8–12 days as six-legged larva in the lungs of hosts and undergo three nymph stages. The whole life cycle can take place in 20 days under ideal conditions. Eggs do not hatch while the host is hibernating.
Economic impact and treatment.
Slug mites are a concern for commercial and hobbyist breeders of snails; as little as six mites can sicken an individual and make it susceptible to infection by threadworms and bacteria such as "Pseudomonas aeruginosa". Countermeasures include regular washing and introduction of "Hypoaspis miles," a predatory species of mite which feeds upon slug mites.

West Middlesex Waterworks Company

The West Middlesex Waterworks Company was a utility company supplying water to parts of west London in England. The company was established in 1806 with works at Hammersmith and became part of the publicly owned Metropolitan Water Board in 1903.
Origins.
The West Middlesex Waterworks Company was founded in 1806 to supply water to the Marylebone and Paddington areas of London. In 1808 the company installed cast iron pipes to supply water from its intakes at Hammersmith.
Infrastructure.
The water company established a 3.5 million gallon reservoir at Campden Hill near Notting Hill just west of Central London. Soon after, in 1825 the company built a new reservoir at Barrow Hill next to Primrose Hill just north of Central London. In the 1850s the quality of drinking water in London was connected to poor public health. John Snow examined the state of waters in 1849 and noted that the West Middlesex was less subject to cholera because its intakes were upstream and it had large reservoirs. The Metropolis Water Act 1852 (succeeded by two others of the same name in 1871 and 1902) was enacted under the conclusions of a report of the Metropolitan Water Board "to make provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water". Under the Act it became unlawful for any water company to extract water for domestic use from the tidal reaches of the Thames after 31 August 1855, and from 31 December 1855 all such water was required to be "effectually filtered". The Company closed the Hammersmith site and new pumping works were established between Sunbury and Molesey Locks at Hampton. The Hampton facility was completed in 1855 and was shared with the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company and the Grand Junction Waterworks Company.

Fetal-maternal haemorrhage

Fetal-maternal hemorrhage is the loss of fetal blood cells into the maternal circulation. It takes place in normal pregnancies as well as when there are obstetric or trauma related complications to pregnancy.
Normally the maternal circulation and the fetal circulation are kept from direct contact with each other, with gas and nutrient exchange taking place across a membrane in the placenta made of two layers, the syncytiotrophoblast and the cytotrophoblast. Fetal-maternal hemorrhage occurs when this membrane ceases to function as a barrier and fetal cells may come in contact with and enter the maternal vessels in the decidua/endometrium.
Description.
Normal Pregnancy.
It is estimated that less than 1 mL of fetal blood is lost to the maternal circulation during normal labor in around 96% of normal deliveries. The loss of this small amount of blood may however be a sensitising event and stimulate antibody production to the fetal red blood cells, an example of which is Rhesus disease of the newborn.
Abnormal Pregnancy.
Causes of increased fetal-maternal hemorrhage are seen as a result of trauma, placental abruption or may be spontaneous with no cause found.
Up to 30 mL of fetal-maternal transfusion may take place with no significant signs or symptoms seen in either mother or fetus. Loss in excess of this may result in significant morbidity and mortality to the fetus. Fetal-maternal hemorrhage is one cause of intrauterine death (IUD).
Treatment.
If ongoing and rapid hemorrhage is occurring then immediate delivery of the fetus may be indicated if the fetus is sufficiently developed. If the hemorrhage has already occurred and now stopped, an inutero transfusion of red cells to the fetus may be recommended.

Tetrazene explosive

Tetrazene (1-(5-tetrazolyl)-3-guanyl tetrazene hydrate) is an explosive material used for sensitization of the priming compositions. It is a derivative of the compound with the IUPAC name tetrazene.
Tetrazene is slightly more impact-sensitive than mercury fulminate. When pressed enough, its sensitivity is reduced or destroyed; this is known as dead pressing. It also decomposes in boiling water. In contact with fire, it readily explodes, producing large amounts of black smoke. It is prepared by reacting sodium nitrite with an aminoguanidine salt dissolved in acetic acid at 30–40 °C.

Höyryklubi (Finnish for "steam club") is a Finnish club act combining saunas and night club music. It was started in 1996 and is still ongoing. Until 2004, Hörykylubi was arranged regularly, once every month or two, in both Lepakko and Saunabar. Thereafter, the demolition of Lepakko and the closing down of Saunabar caused it to become an infrequent, travelling club act. It has since been held, at least once or twice per year, at least in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States. The sauna can be hosted either indoors or outdoors, and is common for both sexes. Nudity is permitted but not compulsory. Both live music and DJing is performed for the entire duration of the club act.

John S. Flizikowski (also known as José; born April 19, 1868 in Preußisch Stargard, West Prussia, now Starogard Gdański, Poland; died July 15, 1934 in Chicago, Illinois) was a notable Chicago architect of residential, church and commercial buildings during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Education and career.
Flizikowski's parents were Joseph and Anna (Paluchowski) Flizikowski. He was educated at the "gymnasium" in Stargard and the Art Institute of Cologne, followed by further study at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg, graduating in 1891. He moved to the United States in 1893 and settled in Chicago, where he initially worked as a draftsman for eight months before going into business as an architect in 1894. He specialized in houses, churches, and schools. 
Works.
Among buildings in Chicago designed by Flizikowski were St. Michael’s Lithuanian church, Holy Cross church and parish residence, the Lutheran church on Humboldt and Dickens Avenues, St. Florian School, and the headquarters of the Polish National Alliance of North America on Division Street.
The Index to the American Contractor's Chicago Building Permit Column, 1898–1912, maintained on the website of The Chicago Historical Society, lists 197 addresses where building permits were issued with John Flizikowski as architect. Among these are the White Eagle Brewing Co. (1911) and Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, home of the Polish Museum of America (1912).
The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS) of 1995 lists 9 of Flizikowski's buildings that "possess some architectural feature or historical association that made them potentially significant in the context of the surrounding community."
Personal.
Flizikowski was a Catholic and a Democrat. He was married twice, to Annie Kowalkowski and to Elizabeth Dettlaff, and had three daughters.

Jaguar F-Type

The Jaguar F-Type is a two-seat sports car, based on a shortened platform of the XK convertible, manufactured by Jaguar Cars from 2013. It is the successor to the famous E-Type.
The car was launched initially as a soft-top convertible, later with a coupé version launched in 2013.
Development.
C-X16 concept (2011).
The C-X16 form takes cues from Jaguar's 2010 C-X75 plug-in hybrid concept supercar, including the shape of the front grille and the wrap-around rear lights, and also has a side-hinged opening rear window reminiscent of the 1961 E-Type.
The C-X16, was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. Jaguar stated that the C-X16 was their smallest car since the 1954 Jaguar XK120, at: length; width; height.
The F-Type was developed under the project code "X152".
F-Type Convertible (2013–).
The convertible version of F-Type was first revealed in Sundance, London which was followed by a presentation at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. Initial F-Type convertible models include the F-Type (340 PS), F-Type S (380 PS) and F-Type V8 S (495 PS).
F-Type Coupé (2014–).
The coupé version was unveiled in late 2013 at the Los Angeles Auto Show, and is expected to go on sale in spring 2014. Launch models scheduled include the F-Type (340 PS), F-Type S (380 PS) and F-Type R (550 PS).
Specifications.
Chassis.
The F-Type uses an all-aluminium chassis, sound and vibration insulation is provided by the addition of a special underbody tray and engine mounts, and a double bulkhead between the engine bay and passenger compartment. The convertible roof is an electrically operated retractable fabric hood. Jaguar says by eschewing metal it can keep the car’s centre of gravity low, while a Thinsulate layer means thermal and sound insulation is akin to a solid roof.
Powertrain.
The entry-level F-Type uses Jaguar’s new 3.0-litre V6 supercharged petrol engine, good for , in 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of . In the middle comes the F-Type S, with the same engine tuned for , a top speed of , and 0 to 60  mph in 4.8 seconds. The top of the range model is the V8 S, with Jaguar’s 5.0-litre, supercharged petrol engine.
The layout is front-engined, rear-wheel-drive. The gearbox is an eight-speed automatic with paddle-shifters offering manual override. There is a mechanical limited-slip differential on the V6 S and an electronic limited-slip differential on the V8.
The engine choices will remain unchanged for F-Type Coupé with its market launch in Spring 2014, but with the addition of a higher performance V8 R model producing in lieu of the convertible V8 S model.
Suspension.
The F-Type has double-wishbone front and rear suspension with adaptive dampers and adjustable suspension settings to allow the driver to adjust ride and handling. The F-Type has a total of 25 different driving modes programmed to suit different road conditions and driving styles.
Interior.
The F-Type interior has a two-seater setup with the leather interior and control buttons finished in aluminium. There is a touchscreen display in the centre console and another TFT display between the dials in the instrument panel. There is also a choice of flat-bottom or alcantara finish for the three-spoke steering wheel and buttons finished in soft-feel matt black.
Equipment.
Jaguar has introduced a stop-start engine shutoff function, which Jaguar claims boosts economy by 5 percent.
The F-Type has bi-xenon headlights with integrated LED daytime running lights, along with full LED lighting at the rear. The S and V8 S versions get an “active exhaust system” which opens special valves over 3,000 rpm to intensify the sound profile.
There is a retractable rear wing spoiler and door handles that are left hidden with the bodywork until needed. The fabric hood raises or lowers in 12 seconds, and can be used when the car is moving at up to .
The audio systems offered, use Meridian technology with either 380 W spread across ten speakers or 770 W across twelve speakers.
Marketing and reception.
In August 2012, it was announced that American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey would be the face of the F-Type, which premiered at the Paris Motor Show in September 2012.
In April 2013 a short film called "Desire" was launched at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival to promote the Jaguar F-Type. Directed by Adam Smith from Ridley Scott Associates, starring Damian Lewis, Jordi Molla and Shannyn Sossamon. New Musical Express called the film "typically sumptuous promo features heavy product placement".
In January 2014, a dozen New York City Subway trains were wrapped with ads advertising the F-Type in preparation for the Super Bowl XLVIII. On February 2, 2014, Jaguar unveiled the new coupe through a Super Bowl advertisement. Jaguar emphasized the idea that British were considered "bad" by Americans because of Hollywood movies always portraying villains to be British. Sir Ben Kingsley, Tom Hiddleston, and Mark Strong all support the villainous way of life as being good. Using these "villains" as the face of Jaguar helped support the edgy side of the luxury brand. This Super Bowl advertisement also challenged other luxury automotive markets in the U.S. stating that Jaguar is just as edgy or maybe more than the other luxury automotive brands.

First Methodist Church (Monroe, Wisconsin)

The First Methodist Church in Monroe, Green County, Wisconsin, is a Gothic revival edifice designed by the former Wisconsin State Architect E. Townsend Mix of Milwaukee and constructed of Cream City brick. It was commissioned in 1869 by the First Methodist Episcopal congregation of Monroe to replace an earlier church building that dated to 1843. The adjacent parsonage was completed in 1886, and the complete ensemble was finally dedicated in 1887.
With its pointed-arch windows as well as the steeply pitched roof and tall, narrow tower, the church exemplifies the late-Gothic revival style. The angled corner belfry tower and decorative brickwork are additional hallmarks of Mix's design. Perhaps the most striking feature is the rose window with elaborate tracery on the front facade, composed of teardrop-shaped stained-glass panes.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. 
Monroe Arts Center.
In 1976, the non-profit Monroe Arts Center, formed to purchase the building, took ownership and opened it to the community for performances and exhibitions.

Flag day (software)

Flag day, as used in system administration, is a change which requires a complete restart or conversion of a sizable body of software or data. The change is large and expensive, and—in the event it doesn't work—reversing the change is similarly difficult and expensive.
This usage originates from a change in the Multics operating system's definition of ASCII, which was scheduled for the U.S. holiday, Flag Day, on June 14, 1966.
Another flag day was January 1, 1983, when the ARPANET changed from NCP to the TCP/IP protocol suite.

American Institute of the City of New York

The American Institute of the City of New York, or, The American Institute of the City of New York for the Encouragement of Science and Invention was a civic organization that existed from ca. 1838 - ca. 1930.
The Institute was an association of inventors. It organized exhibitions, lecture series and radio broadcasts to inform the public about new technologies, and served as a locus for inventors’ professional activities.
The American Institute of The City of New York was chartered on 2 May 1829. Eventually, The American Institute was merged with the New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) in the 1980s.
At one time "Guldens Mustard" had a copy of The American Gold Medal Award on the jar label. Medals were issued in gold, silver and bronze for more than 150 years. The New-York Historical Society received 105 boxes of materials for safekeeping in the 1940s. A detailed index is available at The New-York Historical Society of the contents of each box. Additional materials were given to The New-York Historical Society by Mr. Kenneth Weissman, a trustee and officer, of "The Institute" at the time of the merger with the NYAS.
More recently, Ms. Katherine Jaeger wrote a story about The American Institute that was published in the February 2006 issue of THE NUMISMATIST (Volume 119, Number 2, pages 32–38) with many pictures.

Live in the Studio 1979

Live in the Studio 1979 is a live album by the British band Bauhaus. It was released in 1997 with the Andrew Brooksbank book, "Bauhaus: Beneath the Mask".
Background and critical reception.
Months after its formation, the band then known as Bauhaus 1919 inadvertently recorded eight tracks that would make up "Live in the Studio 1979". 
Predating their debut studio album, the songs during this 25-minute rehearsal were performed live in one take with no overdubs, after the band had finished their official recording duties. 
The recording of this session was distributed in 1997 by Nemo Records (Beggars Banquet) with the Andrew Brooksbank book "Bauhaus: Beneath The Mask" and, since 2010, has been available through the Beggars Archive website.
Author Dave Thompson called the recording "raw, rough, and blistered by the shattered promise of punk's sordid dream, it captures Bauhaus before anything else got its claws in them." Thompson described the track "Honeymoon Croon" as "a psychotic 'My Sharona'". 
Tom Schulte of Allmusic said the album "is a fascinating document exhibiting the forbidding goth birth from the body of its parent and antipode." Schulte remarked that it featured the group's "hallmark sound: attenuated pop guitar lines played low and hauntingly to frame Peter Murphy's dungeon vocals."

Appalachian completed a perfect Southern Conference season at 8–0, and became just the fourth football program in conference history to win four straight conference titles. A quarterfinal playoff loss to the Richmond Spiders ended Appalachian's season, the quest for four consecutive national titles, and snapped the Mountaineers' record string of consecutive playoff victories at 13. Ending the season on a positive note was quarterback Armanti Edwards, who was honored with the Walter Payton Award, given annually to the Division I FCS most outstanding offensive player.

Samuel Tolver Preston

Samuel Tolver Preston (July 8, 1844 – 1917) was an English engineer and physicist. 
His parents were Daniel Bloom Preston (born 1807) and Mary Susannah Tolver. Preston was educated as a Telegraph-engineer. He went to Munich where he attained his Ph.D in 1894 with Ludwig Boltzmann. After that, he worked as a teacher.
He is known for his works (1875–1894) on the kinetic theory of gases and his attempts to combine this theory with Le Sage's theory of gravitation. In his book "Physics of the Ether" (1875) he claimed that if matter is subdivided into ether particles, they would travel at the speed of light and represent an enormous amount of energy. In this way, one grain of matter would contain energy equal to 1000 millions of foot-tons (whereby one foot-ton = 2240 foot pounds).
However, Preston's thoughts were entirely based on classical, non-relativistic physics and cannot be compared with Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence, which is a consequence of special relativity.
Preston also seemed to be the first (1885) to recognize the redundancy of Michael Faraday's explanation of electromagnetic induction. Einstein recognized a similar problem in his paper "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies" (1905, i.e. special relativity).
In 1876 he corresponded with James Clerk Maxwell and alluded to the work of John James Waterston. In 1880 he corresponded with Charles Robert Darwin.

Alexander Mackenzie Fraser

Lieutenant General Alexander Mackenzie Fraser (1758 - 13 September 1809) was a British General. He was known as "Mackenzie" until he took additional name of "Fraser" in 1803.
Family and early life.
The family of Fraser of Castle Fraser, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland are descended, on the female side, from the Honorable Sir Simon Fraser of Inverallochy, second son of Simon, eighth Lord Lovat, but on the male side their name is Mackenzie.
Military service.
Educated at Aberdeen University, he was commissioned into the 73rd Regiment of Foot in 1778. He distinguished himself at the Great Siege of Gibraltar. He later served during the American war of Independence where he was wounded, and serving during the British Campaign in Flanders where he temporarily commanded a brigade under Duke of York. He participated in the Cape of Good Hope expedition in 1796, and served in India from 1796 to 1800. From 1803 to 1805 he was assigned to the Home Staff, temporary commanding on the of the infantry brigades (Hanoverian) of the King's German Legion in 1805. In 1806 he served under General James Henry Craig in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples during his service in Sicily.
He commanded the Alexandria expedition in 1807, invading Egypt on March 16, 1807 with 6,000 British troops. Mackenzie Fraser did first occupy Alexandria to secure the port as a base for Mediterranean operations and to prevent the French from making strategic use of it. Attempts to push inland, however, were not a success, with Fraser losing the two engagements at Rosetta (modern Rashid) on 29 March and 21 April, with two battalions suffering very heavy casualties, particularly in the later ambush. An agreement with Mohammed Ali for British troops to leave Egypt was finally signed on 19 September 1807.
After Egypt he was given command of the 1st Division which was intended to be sent to aid Sweden in 1808 during the Russo-Swedish War in that year. 
During the Peninsular War Mackenzie Fraser commanded the 3rd Division in Portugal and Spain during 1808-1809, and was present at the Battle of Corunna. 
Death.
He again commanded a division during the Walcheren Campaign of 1809, dying from complications brought on by the illness he suffered there.

Jason Lee (Oregon judge)

Jason Dwight Lee (June 2, 1915 – February 19, 1980) was an American politician and judge in the state of Oregon. A controversial lawyer, he served on the Oregon Court of Appeals and made an unsuccessful attempt at joining the Oregon Supreme Court and was the defendant in several cases that made their way to the state’s highest court. His attorney records were the subject of a lawsuit that opened lawyer discipline records up for public scrutiny.
Early life.
Lee was born on June 2, 1915, the son of Myrtle Lee. He was not related to the Jason Lee of the Methodist Mission from Oregon’s pioneer history. He married Dorothy B. Lee, and the two were divorced on July 17, 1969, with the couple having three children while married including Elizabeth Anne and David. The family resided in Salem, Oregon, where Lee was an attorney.
Political career.
A Democrat, Lee ran for Congress in 1956 to represent Oregon first congressional district. He won the Democratic Primary, but lost to incumbent A. Walter Norblad by a 54.8% to 45.2% margin. In 1965, he was admonished for ethics violations and narrowly avoided being suspended from practicing law for one year.
In 1974, he won a primary election over incumbent judge Jacob Tanzer for a seat on the Oregon Court of Appeals. As of 2004, this was the last time an incumbent appellate judge in Oregon lost an election. Tanzer's campaign committee then sued claiming Lee had lied to voters in campaign statements in violation of Oregon’s election laws. Lee lost the jury trial, but the Oregon Supreme Court reversed the decision and ordered the Secretary of State to put him back on the fall ballot. He won the election as the only person on the ballot, defeating Tanzer who waged a write-in campaign. Tanzer won election to the court in 1976, and the two served on the court together until January 1980 when Tanzer was elevated to the Oregon Supreme Court.
Oregon Supreme Court.
Jason Lee filed to run for an open seat on the Supreme Court in 1975. This led reporter Russell Sadler to request Lee’s disciplinary records from the Oregon State Bar (OSB). The OSB refused, even after the Oregon Attorney General ordered the agency to release the files under Oregon’s public records disclosure law. Sadler then sued OSB, with a jury finding in the OSB’s favor, but the Oregon Supreme Court overturned the decision and ordered the release of the records in June 1976. Once released, the files contained many complaints, a letter of reprimand for improperly contacting a judge, and weighed a total of 15 pounds. 
Meanwhile, in March 1976, Lee lost another decision in the Supreme Court with the court ruling he had misappropriated funds from his daughter’s trust fund. He then withdrew from the race for the Oregon Supreme Court. On February 19, 1980, Jason Lee died in office at the age of 64.

Campden Hill

Campden Hill is an area of high ground in west London between Notting Hill, Kensington and Holland Park.
The area is characterised by large Victorian houses which are part of the Phillimore estate. Aubrey House is situated on Campden Hill.
The street called Campden Hill runs from Campden Hill Road to Holland Park. It was built on part of the grounds of the former Bute House. 
Bute House was built c.1812, and was named after the second Marquess of Bute who lived there from 1830 until 1842. The next occupant was the Honourable William Sebright Lascelles, the brother of the third Earl of Harewood; his widow Lady Lascelles lived there until 1856. The sixth Duke of Rutland lived there from 1865 until his death in 1888. The last owner was Blundell Charles Weld, a Lancashire landowner, who renamed the house Blundell House. After he left the house in 1912 or 1913 it was demolished. 
1 Campden Hill was built in 1915 by Edward P. Warren for Colonel Edmond Hills, President of the Royal Astronomical Society and his wife Juliet. From the 1950s to 2001, it was the residence of the Ambassador of Uruguay and has since been marketed by the Phillimore Estate as a private home. 
Campden Hill Gate, a mansion block, was used for the filming of the ITV dramatisation of the Agatha Christie short story, "The Adventure of the Cheap Flat" (1990) in their "Agatha Christie's Poirot" series. Earlier Campden Hill had been the setting for a popular mystery story by Victor Bridges: "The Red Lodge: A Mystery of Campden Hill" (1924).
The Windsor Castle is a Grade II listed public house at 114 Campden Hill Road, dating from 1826.
It is also the site of reservoirs established in the 19th century by the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company.

Ronald Sokol

Ronald P. Sokol (born 1939), lawyer and writer, is a member of the bar in the United States and France. He and his wife live in Aix-en-Provence, France. He is the author of Federal Habeas Corpus and Justice after Darwin and op-ed contributor to the "International Herald Tribune" and the "Christian Science Monitor".
Early life and education.
Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sokol attended Duke University for three years, leaving without a degree to study law at the University of Virginia where he was admitted in 1959. There he came under the influence of Hardy Cross Dillard, then dean of the law school and Daniel J. Meador, then James Monroe Professor and later Associate Attorney-General under President Carter, as well as Charles Horsky, a partner at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. who taught civil rights on weekends. Horsky and Meador regularly argued before the U.S. Supreme Court and were both practitioners and scholars of constitutional litigation. Dillard was then President of the American Society of International Law and later became the American judge at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
Career at Virginia.
Sokol graduated from Virginia in 1962 and was admitted to practice in Wisconsin, but chose to stay on at Virginia to study under Meador and to pursue civil rights studies with Horsky and international law and legal philosophy with Dillard. In 1963 Sokol obtained an LLM degree finishing a thesis that was published as The Puzzle of Equality. While working with Meador Sokol began to appear before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit as court-appointed counsel in habeas corpus cases. Upon completing his degree the University invited him to join the faculty as Lecturer in Appellate Practice and Director of an Appellate Legal Aid program which Sokol initiated. For three years Sokol regularly appeared before the 4th Circuit which singled him out in its published opinions as outstandingly able counsel. "United States v. Shoaf", 341 F.2d 832 (1964).
In 1965 Sokol drew on his experience to publish "A Handbook of Federal Habeas Corpus", the first book on the subject since the 19th century. It was followed by a second edition in 1969.
Career in France.
In 1966 Sokol resigned from the University and moved to Paris where he began work on Justice after Darwin published in 1975. It was one of the first works to bring evolutionary theory to bear on legal problems and on justice in particular and displayed an early interdisciplinary approach to the study of law. In 1967 Sokol moved to Tokyo to study Japanese where he met his wife. They communicated in Japanese until coming to France in December, 1968.
In 1970 Sokol and his wife moved to Aix-en-Provence where they have lived since. In 1973 he was admitted to practice in France and set up his own firm. He continues to argue cases throughout France and to counsel individuals, estates, non-profit foundations, and corporations.
In addition to teaching at the University of Virginia, Sokol has lectured at the University of Aix-en-Provence, the Institute of American Universities in Aix-en-Provence, the Ecoles des Mines in Saint-Étienne, the University of Buskerud in Norway and Imperial College, London. He and his wife have four sons who live in London.

<doc id="19427896" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19427896" title="Canal de l'Ourcq">
Canal de l'Ourcq

The Canal de l'Ourcq is a 108.1 km (67.2 mi) long canal of the Paris Basin with 10 locks. It was built at a width of 3.2 m (10 ft) but was enlarged to 3.7 m (12 ft), which permitted use by more pleasure boats. The canal begins at Port-aux-Perches near the village of Troesnes, where it splits from the channeled River Ourcq, and flows to the Bassin de la Villette, where it joins the Canal Saint-Martin. Paris requires 380 000 m3 (497,000 yd3) of water daily for cleaning the sewer system, gutters, and parks. The Canal de l'Ourcq provides about half of the requirement. Since 1983, the waterway has been designated for use by pleasure craft, and its water is designated for non-drinking uses.
The canal is considered part of the 130 km (80.7 mi) Parisian canal network, along with the Canal Saint-Denis, the bassin de la Villette, and the Canal Saint-Martin. The canals were created as part of the administrative management of water in Paris during the nineteenth century. 
Geography.
The River Ourcq's headwaters are located in the wet prairie near Fère-en-Tardenois in the Aisne département. The river is canalized in Silly-la-Poterie. Its water then follows an 87 km (54 mi) course through the valley and empties into the Marne River near Lizy-sur-Ourcq. Pipework diverts the river from Mareuil, where most of the water flows to Paris via the current canal.
History.
The River Ourcq.
The first efforts towards engineering the waterway were inspired by the need for firewood for heating in Paris. The Valois and Orléans families owned a large tract of forest, and in 1560 a plan was devised to carry wood via a system of simple locks. In 1661, Louis XIV allowed tolls to be collected along the Ourcq River, payable to Philippe d'Orléans.
Potable water in Paris.
When Paris was known as Lutetia, the inhabitants of île Saint-Louis used water from the Seine. In the Gallo-Roman era, while the montagne Sainte-Geneviève was occupied, the water quality began to deteriorate and people began to frequent the Roman Baths or public baths.
During the 4th century, construction of the "aqueduc d’Arcueil" began under Emperor Julian the Apostate. This structure directed water to the Cluny Baths. After the fall of Rome, the aqueducts, to a large extent, were destroyed. For four centuries, from the Merovingian to the Carolingian the waters of the Seine were used, mainly from sources at Belleville and Le Pré-Saint-Gervais. King Philip II, while establishing the Halles de Paris, a sheltered marketplace, had two fountains built in order to aid construction.
By the 18th century, little improvements had been made to bring potable water to Paris. Engineer Pierre-Paul Riquet proposed building a canal from the Ourcq, however his suggestion was not implemented before his death in 1680.
Construction of the canal.
On 19 May 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the creation of the canal. Specifically, he decreed that the Seine be diverted from below the Bassin de l'Arsenal to the Bassin de la Villette. The canals would have the dual purposes of providing shipping channels which avoided the Seine and bringing water to Paris. Funding was secured via a grant and supplemental wine taxes, and the first stone was laid on 23 September. Napoleon appointed Pierre-Simon Girard to direct the project and work was undertaken in January 1804. The design of the canal called for a structure in which the water was both slowmoving, to aid navigation, and non-stagnant, in order to provide healthy drinking water. The canal was also intended to feed the Canal Saint-Martin and Canal Saint-Denis. The projected confluence would enable easier navigation through the city centre, as the Seine was not yet dammed, and the canal would provide an alternate route.
Private financiers were awarded the contract to construct and manage the canals. The city of Paris agreed to purchase land and surrender tolls for 99 years to the firms building the canals (the cost of construction was estimated at 6 million francs). Work began in 1805 under Édouard de Villiers du Terrage. The bassin de la Villette was filled with water on 2 December 1808, and on 15 August 1813 the first boat traveled through the canal. After the fall of the French Empire, work stopped until the Bourbon Restoration in 1814. The monarchy contracted with the "Compagnie Vassel et Saint-Didier" for 99 years, which allowed the company to collect tolls along the property, but required that the canal be completed and maintained. It was then realized that the slope was steep, causing too strong a current. Engineer Marie-Émile Vuigner added five locks to make navigation possible. The canal was opened to navigation in 1822.
According to a 1989 survey of ship lifts, from the Permanent International Association of Navigation Congresses, in 1893 a canal inclined plane was constructed on the canal, near Meaux.
It was only capable of lifting vessels 70 tons and 24 metres length. The vertical lift was 12.2 metres.
Under the reign of Napoleon III, water shortages caused boats to become stranded along the canal. In response, authority was given to take water from the Marne. In 1895 construction began to widen the canal in order for it to accommodate 1,000 tonne vessels. In 1920 this widening was extended to Les Pavillons-sous-Bois. Today the canal provides approximately half of the daily water requirement for the city's public works.
Developments.
In February 2005, The Council of Paris launched a study on the construction of a proposed port along the Canal de l'Ourcq. The port would facilitate the transportation of material processed by the waste treatment centre Romainville du Syctom. This would avoid the need for trucks to carry this waste.
The port would fulfill the following functions:

The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives

The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives, founded in 1947, is committed to preserving a documentary heritage of the religious, organizational, economic, cultural, personal, social and family life of American Jewry. It has become the largest free-standing research center dedicated solely to the study of the American Jewish experience.
History.
The American Jewish Archives (AJA) was founded by Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus (1896-1995), former graduate and professor at the Hebrew Union College, in the aftermath of World War II and The Holocaust. For over a half century, the American Jewish Archives has been preserving American Jewish history and imparting it to the next generation. Dr. Marcus directed the American Jewish Archives for forty-eight years until his death at which time the AJA’s name became The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives. Dr. Gary P. Zola, one of Marcus’s students, became the second Executive Director on 1 July 1998.
Collections.
The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives is a semi-autonomous division of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Located on HUC-JIR’s Cincinnati campus, the AJA houses over ten million pages of documentation. It contains nearly of archives, manuscripts, nearprint materials, photographs, audio and video tapes, microfilm, and genealogical materials. Its four core areas of collecting interest are those records of American Jewish personalities and institutions that possess historical significance; the records of American Reform Judaism; the records of American Jewish communities with a special focus on the Jews of Cincinnati; and the records of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.
Publications.
The Marcus Center also publishes a semi-annual publication, "The American Jewish Archives Journal (AJAJ)". It documents and preserves the American Jewish experience through the publication of scholarly articles and primary documents written by academic and independent historians from around the world. Furthermore, it contains important news from the AJA and book reviews of relevant secondary literature. The "AJAJ" is considered one of the two major refereed periodicals that examine the entire scope of American Jewish history. Issues of the AJAJ are available online through the AJA website.
Fellowship Program.
In 1977, The Marcus Center founded its Fellowship Program which serves to bring scholars to Cincinnati in order to make use of the AJA’s unique collection as well as to present their work to the larger community. Today the Marcus Center administers twelve endowed fellowships and it is its hope that this program advances our understanding of both American Jewish history and of our nation as a whole.
Website.
The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives is continually expanding its electronic and print publications. Its website features media-rich, interactive, online exhibits including 350 Years of American Jewry, Great Voices of Reform Judaism, and Hebrew Union College: 125 Years. As well, it posts educational resources, audio and visual programs, and links to other institutional collections.

Lincoln American Tower

The Lincoln American Tower is a 22-story building located at the corner of North Main and Court streets in Memphis, Tennessee. It is also a historical landmark, one of the first steel frame skyscrapers built in Memphis. The tower underwent a six-year refurbishing project starting in 2002, and despite a fire in 2006, is now open and accepting tenants.
The building currently features 31 residential apartments, 3 floors of commercial offices, and New York-based Ceriello Fine Foods on the ground floor.
History.
The site itself has a unique history, as it is located near the location of Irving Block Prison, which was on the north side of Court Square, which was used by the Union Army to house Confederate sympathizers during the Civil War. Freeing prisoners from Irving Block Prison was one of the three major objectives of Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's raid in the Second Battle of Memphis.
In 1924, the president of the Memphis branch of the Columbia Mutual Insurance Company (later renamed to the Lincoln American Insurance Company), Lloyd Binford, had the gleaming white tower built overlooking Court Square. Binford later made an infamous name for himself across the country as head of the Memphis Censor Board, which he ran from his own offices on the top floor of the building.
The Lincoln American Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
On October 6, 2006, the building was damaged by fire after embers from a major fire at the nearby First United Methodist Church were carried several blocks by strong winds. The result lit the top few floors of the building on fire, including the roof, and filled much of downtown Memphis with smoke. The nearby Court Annex building was destroyed in the same fire.
Despite the fire, the renovation of the building continued, and the first tenants in 2008 were the Plough Foundation, who leased of space in the building.
Design.
The tower is a replica of New York's Woolworth Building, at one-third scale.

The habitat is characterized by steep cliffs, mostly bare, those some have grassy-turfed ledges that rise on both sides. The elevation is above sea level. 
Fauna.
Northern Fulmars found here represent about 3.2% of the Canadian population. Breeding Glaucous Gulls represent about 1% of the Canadian population. This has earned the inlet and its surrounds, including Scott Island, a designation as an Important Bird Area (No. NU070), as well as Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat Site designation by the Canadian Wildlife Service.
Polar bears, harp seals, ringed seal, and walrus frequent the area.

In 1913, Clapp fielded an African American player for his team. Kansas Normal School (now called Pittsburg State University officially launched a formal protest against the appearance of the player. In that same game, a player named Fred Hamilton was playing left halfback and was injured to the extent of having a broken neck and paralyzed arms. The game ended in a 6-6 tie.
The "Jinx".
The 1914 proved especially important to Southwestern College lore. On November 8, 1912, Southwestern defeated Fairmont College (now Wichita State University) by a score of 41 to 3. This was the first of a series of wins where Southwestern would beat or tie Fairmont ten of eleven games. This period of time earned the school the name "The Jinx" for many years to come.
Basketball.
Clapp also coached men's basketball at Southwestern and was the second person on record to hold that post. He coached for five seasons, from 1909 until 1914. His record was 39 wins and 24 losses.

San Diego Film Commission

The San Diego Film Commission is a nonprofit, government-funded office that promotes and facilitates film and television production in the city. Created in 1976 by mayor Pete Wilson, it was originally called the San Diego Motion Picture and Television Bureau.
Origins.
San Diego had a silent film production industry from 1898-1912.
In the early 1970s, producers of the Los Angeles-based television series "Harry O", seeking new locales for the show, moved production to San Diego. At that time, television and film production accounted for only $400,000 in annual revenue for the city. But "Harry O" alone earned an estimated $1.5 million in a matter of months, in addition to providing hundreds of jobs. Unfortunately, the show's producers soon found their work in San Diego impeded by the slow processing of city permits and seemingly arbitrary fees levied by numerous local agencies. "Harry O" returned to Los Angeles after filming just a few episodes. Frustrated producers and civic leaders met with Wilson, members of San Diego's County Board of Supervisors and executives from the Port of San Diego to discuss new initiatives that would not only end debacles such as the "Harry O" incident, but promote the city as a "one-stop shop" for filmmakers.
The Commission created a precedent with "roundtable" meetings that brought filmmakers together with representatives of public safety and other government departments to streamline the permit process. The method became a model for similar commissions in other cities. San Diego also initiated tax incentives to make the area attractive to film production.
Success and evolution.
Within the first decade of operation, the SDFC proved its worth by drawing high-profile projects such as Top Gun and the hit television series Simon & Simon to San Diego. In the years since, the Commission has facilitated production of such high-profile projects as "Traffic", "Almost Famous", ', "Lords of Dogtown", "Bring It On", ' and a short-lived revival of the 1980s hit series "Hunter", all of which brought revenue and jobs to the area. 
Originally, the Commission was a division of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, but was spun off to become its own independent agency in 1997. It continues to work as a nonprofit development agency for film, television, commercial and print/still photography talent in the city and county of San Diego.
In 2012, the SDFC was incorporated into San Diego's Tourism Authority. Faced with a huge drop in funding, the Tourism Authority laid off 40 percent of its 79-member staff, including the entire staff of SDFC.

Valentine Warner

Valentine Warner (born 1972) is a chef. He started his television career on the BBC in Autumn 2008 with What to Eat Now, a cookery programme based on his book of the same name.
BBC bosses dubbed him "the Russell Brand of the kitchen", an epithet he himself is baffled by. He is affectionately referred to by many as “truffle head” due to his passion for truffles, as seen in episode one of his series, What to Eat Now. Warner's recipes appeared quite regularly in the "Living" section of the television and radio guide magazine, Radio Times, during the six weeks when his series What to Eat Now was being broadcast on BBC Two. In one of the final recipes which he wrote for the Radio Times "Living" section, he discusses recipes with mackerel, stating that if he could eat only one fish, it would certainly be mackerel. Valentine also writes a recipe feature every month for olive magazine.
Valentine has written two bestselling books to tie in with his BBC2 series - "What to Eat Now" and "What to Eat Now - More Please!"
Warner attended Bedales School in Hampshire from 1985 to 1990 and in 1994 studied at the Byam Shaw School of Art. Warner's father was diplomat Sir Frederick Warner who was British Ambassador to Japan from 1972 until 1975.

Villa Cavrois

Villa Cavrois in Croix is a large mansion built in 1932, for Paul Cavrois, an industrialist from Roubaix - he was working in the textile industry - by Parisian architect Robert Mallet-Stevens.
A modern concept.
Villa Cavrois is a testimony to a lifestyle as it was conceived in the late 1920s by modern architects contemporary with Le Corbusier. Luminosity, hygiene and comfort are the keywords that underlie such buildings. Villa Cavrois illustrates this concept with simplicity and elegance. The large modern mansion was organized to offer the best possible lifestyle to the nine members of the family and to facilitate the daily work of the household staff. Its style was a total break from that of other neighbouring houses of the same era in the suburbs of Croix. Clear guidelines governed the design of the building, which was commissioned in 1929: "air, light, work, sports, hygiene, comfort and efficiency".
Mallet-Stevens' work is not limited to the organisation of the building's volumes to best meet the needs of his customer; he also designs the interior decoration and the gardens which surround the vomma. The map of the villa is studied to ease the movements and to organize in a rationale way the day to day life in the building. Around the marge entry hall which welcomes the visitors, the domain of the parents is developing in the east wing, while the west wing is devoted to the kids and to the household staff. It also houses the rooms where the family gathers, such as the dining hand and the children dining hall, linked to the parc by an external staircase.
The choice of materials and furniture inside echoes the hierarchy of spaces: everything is conceived and adapted for use in places. Simplicity and functionality of the furniture prevail in all parts. The luxury of this house does not spread in the paneling or gilding, it unfolds in the richness of the materials used, such as the marble and wood. 
The Villa Cavrois especially provided to its occupants a large number of amenities especially rare for the time, such as the distribution of hot water, cold and softened. Electricity occupies a special place in this building: each room has a radio loudspeaker and an electric clock. The apparatus for cleaning the machine, vacuum or power are also cooler. The Cavrois also have at their disposal heater bathrobe! The phone, present in all parts, allows people to communicate among themselves or with the outside world. Lighting has also been the subject of special care, in collaboration with engineer Solomon.
A difficult evolution.
From 1940 the German Army requisitioned the Villa. In 1947, at the request of Paul Cavrois, the architect Pierre Barbe made changes to adapt the home to the new lifestyles of the family which now comprised several couples. 
After the death of Madame Cavrois in 1986, the furniture was scattered and the house sold to a real estate company which planned to sell off the park in parcels. The villa was abandoned and quickly looted, ransacked and squatted. 
In 1990, all of the city and the park are classified as Monument historique by decision of Conseil d'État. 
That same year saw the birth of an association to protect and preserve the house. Since its inception the association has lobbied the competent authorities on the fate of the villa. 
The State (Ministry of Culture) purchased the building in 2001 and in 2004, restoration work commenced on the exterior (closed and covered terraces, windows ...) and the reinstatement of domestic volumes. 
By order of December 18, 2008, the State entrusted villa Cavrois to Centre des monuments nationaux (CMN), with the mission to restore it and open it to the public.
CMN is currently conducting the restoration of the interior spaces and decors (floors, wall coverings, paintwork, furniture), in order to recreate the art of living in the 20th century. CMN has also planned a vast restoration of the park (replantation of trees, restoration of the water mirror and of original alleys, illumination of the park and the villa) and the creation of a car park.
The villa will open to the public progressively, starting in 2013, with a cultural project aiming at making it a national and international reference point for modern architecture and design. 
The global amount of works planned by CMN for the opening of villa Cavrois is estimated at 9 million euros.

Richard C. Nolan

Richard C. "Dick" Nolan was an American football coach in the United States. He was one of the early adopters of a heavier schedule than his peer schools, playing 12 games a year. He would later use football as a physical fitness tool to develop physical fitness in the United States Navy.
Playing history.
High school and Junior College.
A native of Picher, Oklahoma, Nolan played guard and also served as captain of the Picher Gorillas football team in 1929. After graduating from Picher High School, Nolan was an all-state junior college football player at Oklahoma Military Academy.
Emporia State.
After completing his studies at the junior college level, Nolan attended Emporia Teachers College and was named to the All-Kansas football team while playing for that school's program under head coach Fran Welch. Nolan also received a master's degree from Emporia Teachers College.
Coaching history.
Arkansas City Junior College.
Nolan was the head football coach at Arkansas City Junior College in Arkansas City, Kansas from 1935-1939. While at Arkansas City Junior City College, Nolan's teams were undefeated at home for four years. The school has since disbanded its football program.
Southwestern College.
In 1940, Nolan was hired by the Southwestern College Moundbuilders as the school's athletic director head football coach. One newspaper noted that Nolan had his work cut out for him at Southwestern: "Football, however, been on the slide at Winfield since 1934 and Nolan faces a difficult problem of bringing the boys back into the money." Another Kansas newspaper in March 1940 wrote:"Nolan knows football. Better than that, Nolan knows football players. It is reported that he drove through Frontenac, where every boy is either a potential all state guard or fullback, with an empty car. He left the town, bound for Arkansas City, with players jammed in the seats and standing on the running board."
During Nolan's first year with the Moundbuilders, interest in football grew, as one Kansas newspaper reported: "Football interest continues rampant here. The largest opening crowd in many years saw the Builders play Alva last week." 
Nolan was a supporter of a heavier schedule than most schools at the time, choosing to play twelve games in the 1941 regular season when most schools would only play eight. It was not until 2005 that schools would widely pursue twelve games in a regular season.
Nolan was the ninth football coach for the Southwestern College Moundbuilders in Winfield, Kansas and held that position 2 seasons, from 1940 to 1941. His overall coaching record at Southwestern was 12 wins, 8 losses, and 2 ties. As of completion of the 2006 season, this ranks him 14th at Southwestern in terms of total wins and 16th at Southwestern in terms of total winning percentage ().
Military service and football.
With the entry of the United States into World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Nolan enlisted in the U.S. Navy. In July 1942, Nolan was assigned along with other athletic coaches to participate in a "physical hardening program" at the Naval Air Corps' pre-flight training program at Gardner Air Base.
In 1944, Nolan was appointed the head football coach for a U.S. Navy football team known as the "Norman Navy Zoomers". That year, he coached the "Zoomers" to a 15-0 victory over the Oklahoma A&M football team that went on to win the Cotton Bowl Classic on January 1, 1945. He continued serving in the Navy after World War II and was the Operations Officer at the Dallas Naval Air Station as of March 1947.

Harold Hunt (coach)

Harold S. Hunt was a sports figure in the United States, working as a coach in American football and basketball. He stood out and gained nationwide exposure as an example of sportsmanship when he rejected a touchdown that would have won a game for his team.
Football.
Hunt was named the 13th football coach for the Southwestern College Moundbuilders in Winfield, Kansas and held that position 3 seasons, from 1949 to 1951. His overall coaching record at Southwestern was 6 wins, 18 losses, and 3 ties. This ranks him 20th at Southwestern in terms of total wins and 24th at Southwestern in terms of total winning percentage (as of completion of the 2007 season).
The Rejected Touchdown.
The opening game of the 1951 season against Central Missouri State College produced an event that opposing coach Tate Page called "the finest act of sportsmanship" that he ever saw. In the third quarter, Southwestern halfback Arthur Johnson completed a long run down the sidelines nearest Southwestern's bench. The referee signalled a touchdown and the crowd of 2,000 went wild with enthusiasm.
Coach Hunt ran out on the field and stated, "Southwestern rejects the touchdown!" and stated that Johnson had stepped out of bounds, nullifying the touchdown. Not a single one of the referees had been in a position to see him do so, but they agreed to nullify the touchdown, and returned the ball to the point where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later confirmed Coach Hunt's observation.
Basketball.
From 1940 through 1943 Harold Hunt coached basketball at Quincy Senior High School in Quincy, Illinois. His Quincy teams had 12 wins and 13 losses in the 1940/41 season, 23 wins and 4 losses in the 1941-42 season, and 14 wins and 8 losses in 1942/43. In 1942 and 1943, his teams won district and regional titles and qualified for the state finals. In 1943, he left Quincy to serve as a U.S. Navy officer in the V5 Pre-Flight Aviation Program.
Coach Hunt also was the basketball coach at Southwestern for three seasons, from 1949 until 1952. His teams accumulated a record of 31 wins and 37 losses.

Rosa Tamarkina

Rosa Tamarkina (23 March 19205 August 1950) was a Soviet pianist who won second prize in the third International Frédéric Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw (1937).
Tamarkina, born in Kiev, began learning piano as a very young child. She was enrolled for the children’s section of the Kiev Conservatory where, for five years (1928–1932), her teacher was Nikolai Goldenberg.
Between 1932 and 1935 she was a student in the special children’s section at the Moscow Conservatory. She completed the higher course at the Conservatoire in 1940, as a graduate of Alexander Goldenweiser’s piano class. She continued her studies with Goldenweiser and later (1943–1945) with Konstantin Igumnov.
Tamarkina started appearing in public at the age of 15, astounding listeners and critics with the maturity of her interpretation, temperament and virtuosity. From 1936, she developed her concert career within Russia. Regardless of whether she would play Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Scriabin, Rachmaninoff or especially Chopin, her grasp of the work was apt, full of noble simplicity, charm and natural poetry.
Tamarkina took part in the Chopin Competition at the age of 17. Already after Stage 1 it was clear that she was in the running for a prize. Eventually the jury, composed of renowned pianists such as Emil von Sauer, Wilhelm Backhaus, Heinrich Neuhaus, Józef Turczyński, Józef Śmidowicz and Jerzy Żurawlew, awarded her second prize.
Professor Piotr Rytel wrote: “Younger […] than Zak, Ms. Rosa Tamarkina […] when it comes to her inner relationship to music might even surpass Zak. […] Sixteen years and already such an excellent technique, complexity and ease.”
Neuhaus wrote: "Rosa Tamarkina made a real sensation on the competition -- not merely because of her age. Despite her young age, she is beyond doubt a perfectly matured, perfectly conscious pianist. Backhaus shouted to me: "This is marvelous" "
In 1946, Tamarkina started teaching at the Moscow Conservatory, which greatly limited the number of her concert appearances. In celebration of the centenary of Chopin's death in October 1949, a concert was held at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory where Tamarkina performed Chopin's Concerto in F minor.
This was to be her last stage appearance before her death, which occurred in Moscow in 1950, aged only 30.
Tamarkina is today remembered for her brilliant interpretations of Chopin’s works (Fantasie in F minor, Scherzos in B flat minor and C sharp minor, Polonaise in F sharp minor, Sonata in B minor, Nocturne in G major and Concerto in F minor), Franz Liszt (Sonata in B minor, Mephisto Waltz, Hungarian Rhapsody No. 10, Rigoletto Concert Paraphrase), Schumann (Fantasie in C major) and Rachmaninoff (Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor). Her numerous recordings include Chopin’s Fantasie in F minor and Scherzo in C sharp minor.

Ice hockey in the United Kingdom

Ice hockey has been played in the United Kingdom since the beginning of the twentieth century, and it was a game between Englishmen that is generally accepted to have started the modern era of the sport. The Great Britain men's national ice hockey team enjoyed worldwide success through the 1920s and 1930s, achieving bronze at the 1924 Olympics, and gold twelve years later. They also won medals at the World Championships in 1935, 1937 and 1938, though never won the tournament. The national team has struggled since the Second World War, and has not finished better than twelfth in the World Championships since 1962. Ice hockey is played professionally in the United Kingdom in the Elite Ice Hockey League, a ten-team league which was founded in 2003.
History.
Ice hockey was first played in Canada during the early nineteenth century, based on similar sports such as field hockey that were played in Europe. The sport was originally played with a stick and ball, but in 1860 a group of English veterans from the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment played a game in Kingston, Ontario, utilising a puck for what is believed to be the first time. This match, played on the frozen harbour by the city, is sometimes considered to be the birth of modern ice hockey. The game developed quickly in Canada, and in the late nineteenth century, Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby purchased a decorative punch bowl from a London silversmith to award to the leading amateur side in the country: this became known as the Stanley Cup.
In the United Kingdom, a five-team league was in operation in England in 1903; the first in Europe. The league was contested at two rinks in London: the Prince's Skating Club in Knightsbridge and Hengler's Ice Rink in the City of Westminster. It was won by the London Canadians. The first game to be played in Scotland occurred five years later in Crossmyloof, Glasgow. The same year saw the creation of the International Ice Hockey Federation, of which Great Britain was a founding member. The British Ice Hockey Association was set up in 1914, and continued until 1999, when it was replaced by Ice Hockey UK.

Bernart Alanhan de Narbona

Bernart Alanhan de Narbona was a minor troubadour probably from Narbonne. He left behind only one song, "No posc mudar qu'eu no diga", a "sirventes" about the loss of Jerusalem to the Saracens, though it was not classified as a Crusade song in the seminal work on the genre by Kurt Lewent (1905). 
Three different datings have been offered based on the internal reference to Jerusalem. In 2003 Linda Paterson suggested a "terminus post quem" of 1187, since the first loss of Jerusalem to the Saracens—during the time of the troubadours—was to Saladin. In 1885 Camille Chabaneau, who was followed by Carl Appel in 1892, first suggested that the poem was written between 1245 and 1250 in response to the loss of the city to the Turks in 1244. An allusion to the city's occupation by the Egyptians, who signed Jerusalem over to the Emperor Frederick II in 1239, is cited in support of this.

Geneva Phonograms Convention

The Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms, also known as the Geneva Phonograms Convention, is a 1971 international agreement relating to copyright protection for sound recordings.
Legal context.
By the mid-1950s, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Buenos Aires Convention and Universal Copyright Convention granted strong rights to creators of printed or artistic content – and also to composers and performers of music – in most first world countries. The publisher of a book could prosecute a maker of unauthorized copies even if they operated in a different country. But there was no equivalent protection for sound recordings.
The 1961 Rome Convention for the first time granted international recognition for copyright in sound recordings. Now music labels were recognized as having a copyright interest in the recording itself, separately from the composer and performer. This gave them standing to prosecute makers of unauthorized copies of their tapes or records in other countries.
Technological context.
In the mid-1960s music labels began producing pre-recorded compact cassettes, a technology developed in the late 1950s which offered relatively compact players and space-efficient storage compared to vinyl records. It was also very much cheaper and simpler to make unauthorized copies compared to vinyl records. By the late 1960s copyright infringement and counterfeiting of these recordings had become common, and the music industry lobbied for a new international treaty which would give them additional powers to combat copyright infringement.
The 1971 convention.
The 1971 convention granted record producers the international right to block imports of counterfeit music recordings, and to take action against distributors and retailers who sold them.

<doc id="19428270" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19428270" title="Payne v. Tennessee">
Payne v. Tennessee

Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991) was a United States Supreme Court decision which held that testimony on the form of a victim impact statement is admissible during the sentencing phase of a trial and, in death penalty cases, does not violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. "Payne" overruled two of the Courts' precedents: "Booth v. Maryland" and "South Carolina v. Gathers".
Facts.
Pervis Tyrone Payne was the defendant in this trial prosecuted in Tennessee. On Saturday, June 27, 1987, he attempted to rape an acquaintance of his, Charisse Christopher, and finally he murdered her and her two-year-old daughter. Neighbors heard noises and yelling, and called the police. Upon arriving, a police officer "immediately encountered Payne who was leaving the apartment building, so covered in blood that he appeared to be 'sweating blood'".
The police found "a horrifying scene." Forty-two stab wounds were on Charisse's body. He had stabbed her three-year-old son Nicholas dozens of times but he was alive. He ran away to his girlfriend's house, and discarded his clothes, which were soaked in blood. Meanwhile, Nicholas Christopher held in his intestines while the emergency medical technicians transported him to the emergency room. There was significant physical evidence implicating the defendant: Payne's fingerprints on cans of malt liquor, the victims' blood soaked into his clothes, and his property left at the scene of the crime.
Dozens of witnesses, including the police, friends, the neighbors, and experts, testified at the trial. The evidence that he perpetrated the attacks was "overwhelming," according to Chief Justice Rehnquist. Payne denied the charges, claiming he came upon the bloody victims. The district attorney stressed, in his closing arguments, the senselessness of the killings, the violence displayed by the defendant, and the innocence of the victims. The jury convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder and a related charge.
At the sentencing phase, the judge allowed both the public defender to adduce mitigating testimony from the defendant's friends and family, and the district attorney (DA) to introduce evidence from the grandmother/mother of the victims.
Payne appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, and then asked for a "writ of certiorari" from the United States Supreme Court. "Cert" was granted, with the court noting that it would have to reconsider its past precedent. The case was argued on April 24, 1991 and decided on June 27, 1991.
Issues and holding.
The main issue in the case was whether, as the Court had previously held, damaging testimony in the form of a victim impact questioning could be admissible in the sentencing phase of an otherwise fair state trial.
The defendant's guilt or innocence was not in issue at this hearing, as only the legal issues of admissibility of evidence, the victims' rights, and "stare decisis" were to be decided. The Court legally presumed that Payne was, in fact, guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, which was, in any case, not on appeal in that instance.
The court held that testimony on the form of a victim impact statement was admissible and constitutional in death penalty cases, thus expressly overruling two of that courts' precedents: "Booth v. Maryland" (1987) and "South Carolina v. Gathers" (1989)
Reasoning.
The court's decision stated a number of strands of reasons for its rationale in deciding this case:
Three Justices dissented: John Paul Stevens, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun.
Impact.
"Payne" has had a significant, ongoing impact in victim's rights, criminology, the law, the Court itself, and the lives of the parties involved.
The case allowed victim impact statements in US courts, and the overwhelming majority of states now allow such use in the sentencing phase of trials. The whole area of victim's rights was boosted by this case. One scholar recently wrote:
Another scholar calls the verdict in "Payne" an example of "symbolic violence." It was pointed out that:
The case was one in a line of cases that showed how the Rehnquist Court shifted to the conservative or "right" on criminal cases. The case is cited by at least one major college text book as a "capstone case."
Payne's execution was stayed in April 2007, and after protracted litigation, again scheduled in December 2007, and stayed again that month. Payne is still alive as of January 2010 and is on death row for the double homicide.

Due to the ongoing restructuring, the league had only 10 clubs (expanded to 12 the next season as three clubs were relegated from the Premier League and only one promoted). 
Maccabi Jaffa started the season in Liga Leumit, but a failure to have their budget approved by the Israel Football Association led to them being replaced by Bnei Sakhnin (who had finished 9th the previous season and had been relegated to the third tier) soon after the season started, with Maccabi Jaffa dropping into Liga Alef, the fourth tier. Jaffa's results were all annulled and Sakhnin took over their fixtures, replaying the ones Jaffa had already played. 
Tzafririm Holon won the title and were promoted, whilst Hapoel Ashkelon finished bottom and were relegated to Liga Artzit. Holon's Dani Niron was the league's top scorer with 23 goals.

Welshpool Raven Square railway station

Welshpool Raven Square railway station, located in Welshpool, in Wales, is the eastern terminus of the narrow gauge Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway (W&LLR). 
History.
The W&LLR was one of the few narrow gauge branch lines to be built under the provisions of the 1896 Light Railways Act, and opened for operations on 4 April 1903 to aid economic development in a remote area. Originally operated by the Cambrian Railways, it started from a simple set of sidings located alongside the standard gauge line at Welshpool railway station, and traversed the town by means of a twisting section of track which required continual use of the train's bell and whistle.
After nationalisation to the Great Western Railway in the 1923 grouping, on 9 February 1931 the line lost its passenger service, and became a freight-only line. It was temporarily re-opened to passengers between 6 and 11 August 1945 for the Eisteddfod. Freight traffic lingered on until 1956, by which time British Railways decided to close the line.
A group of volunteers and enthusiasts took the line over and started raising money to restore it. On 6 April 1963 the first section of the line was re-opened as a tourist railway. The line through Welshpool however could not be reopened, and so Raven Square was developed on the western edge of the town, opening on 18 July 1981. The new station building was obtained from Eardisley in Herefordshire and is a historic example of a type once prepared from a wooden kit, similar to many built on rural lines. Also, a water tower built over 100 years ago was obtained from Pwllheli station.
Location.
The Raven Square station is situated by the roundabout that is the junction of the A458, A490 and B4381 roads. It is on the western edge of Welshpool, one mile (1.6 km) from the Cambrian Line station, which is located in the eastern side of the town. Powis Castle and its substantial grounds, lie not far to the south of the station, though not directly accessible from this point. Raven Square also hosts the Raven inn, a family traditional pub which also takes its name from Raven Square

John Barnwell (cricketer)

Charles John Patrick Barnwell (23 June 1914 at Stoke-on-Trent – 4 September 1998 at Fivehead, Somerset) played first-class cricket for Somerset as an amateur player before and after the Second World War.
John Barnwell was a right-handed batsman who, in a team with a large number of all-rounders, frequently batted as low as No 8 or 9 in the order. He sometimes captained the team in the absence of the regular captains Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg. He was also known as a good fielder in the covers. 
Educated at Repton, Barnwell first appeared for Somerset in 1935, and played 11 matches the following year, though with a highest score of 38 he made little impact. In 1937, he played only seven games, but passed 50 for the first time with 73 in the match against Gloucestershire at Taunton. 
In 1938 and 1939, and again in the first post-war season of 1946, Barnwell appeared in more than half Somerset's first-class matches, although he failed to top 400 runs in any season. In 1938, batting at No 9, he made an unbeaten 49 and shared a partnership for the eighth wicket of 143 with Longrigg which was a county record until beaten by Viv Richards and Ian Botham in 1983. His best season was 1939, when he made 396 runs, including his career-best of 83 against Hampshire at Taunton. 
After the 1946 season, Barnwell was allegedly offered the captaincy of Somerset, but turned it down, and appeared for the county only once more, in 1948.
His career outside cricket was as a farmer, breeding silver foxes for the fur trade. According to another account by the same author, he "personified the 'old school', a debonair amateur... Rightly proud of his nimbleness in the covers and the four boundaries in a row he once audaciously took off Voce at Trent Bridge." 
His nephew, Michael Barnwell, played cricket for Cambridge University, Somerset and Eastern Province in the 1960s and 1970s.

The only child of French parents living in London, he was educated at the French Lycée in London and the Salesian College, Farnborough. He graduated at King's College London in 1948 and qualified as a teacher in 1949. In 1953 he was awarded the M.A. degree of London university for which he submitted a thesis on Cardinal John Morton and his episcopal colleagues. He was then employed by a firm of industrial designers to collect and exhibit old prints and to write explanatory booklets for three theme pubs in London. In 1954 he carried out research on MPs in the Cinque Ports for the early Tudor volume of the History of Parliament and wrote the chapter on schools in Salisbury during the nineteenth century for the Victoria County History. Though trained as a medieval historian, he was appointed in 1956 as assistant-lecturer in early modern history at the University of Birmingham where he has chosen to remain for the rest of his professional career. In 1984 he was awarded the degree of D. Litt (Birmingham). His earliest book was "The Voyage of Sir Nicholas Carewe" published in 1959 by Cambridge University Press for the Roxburghe Club. 
In the 1950s Knecht travelled widely in Europe, often cycling, as tour leader for the Students' International Travel Association, based in the U.S.A. and the Ramblers' Association.In 1970 he turned his attention to French history in the sixteenth century and began research on the reign of the French king Francis I, producing the first serious work in English on that king in 1982. This he revised completely for the king's 500th anniversary in 1994. Since then he has published some twenty books on early modern French history. 
In 1977 Knecht formed a close association with a group of French art historians led by André Chastel and Jean Guillaume, taking part in several of their summer schools. In May 1994 he was Visiting Fellow of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris. In 2001 he became a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Palmes académiques.Promoted to the rank of Officier in August 2010. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, an elected member of the Société de l'Histoire de France and is a co-founder and former Chairman of the Society for the Study of French History (1994–97) and of the Society for Renaissance Studies (1989–92).

Engineering Division

The Engineering Division was a division of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps in the United States Department of War. It was formed on 31 August 1918, under the direction of Lt Col Jesse G. Vincent, to study and design American versions of foreign aircraft. It was later renamed "Engineering Division, Air Service" and then in 1926 "Material Division Air Corps". It was based at McCook Field, and in October 1927 moved to Wright Field.
Background.
United States Armed Forces procurement of aircraft began when the Army's 1907 Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, acquired several of the Wright Military Flyer of 1909. USAAF/USAF aircraft Research and Development (R&D) was merged with aircraft procurement twice in the 20th Century (1944, 1992):
Airplane Engineering Department.
The Airplane Engineering Department was established by the Equipment Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1917 for World War I experimental engineering. The department had a 1917 Foreign Data Section, and the Airplane Engineering Department was on McCook Field at Dayton, Ohio (the 1917 Patterson Field and Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot were nearby.) In June 1917 Commander Raynal Cawthorne Bolling lead a Bureau of Aircraft Production mission to France, investigating if it was possible to build British and French aircraft in the United States. McCook Field established the Air School of Application in 1919 after the department became the Airplane Engineering Division on 31 August 1918 under Lt Col Jesse G. Vincent (Packard co-engineer of the 1917 V-12 Liberty engine) to study and design American versions of foreign aircraft. It combined a number of existing divisions of the Air Service, including the Engineering Department and the Airplane Experimental Department.
Engineering.
The Engineering Division was set up to evaluate proposals, and the first project it undertook was installing an American Liberty L-12 engine on the British de Havilland D.H.9 aircraft, redesignating it USD-9 and USD-9A. Other aircraft modified include the Bristol F.2B, redesignated XB-1.
In 1920, the Engineering Division's Bureau of Aircraft Production completed the design of the Ground Attack, Experimental, (GAX) aircraft built as the Boeing GA-1, and designed the VCP-1 that won the initial Pulitzer Race in 1920 at Roosevelt Field (the division also designed the TP-1 and TW-1. In 1925, in order to promote private aircraft developments, the Engineering Division was restricted by General Mason Patrick and could no longer build experimental aircraft.
In 1926 the United States Army Air Service was replaced with the United States Army Air Corps, and the Engineering Division merged in 1926 with the Air Service's Supply Division (formed by 1919) to form the Material Division (Air Corps) at Wright Field.

Utah State Route 66

State Route 66 (SR-66) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, connecting I-84 in the city of Morgan to SR-65 near East Canyon State Park over a distance of about .
Route description.
The route's southern terminus is at its intersection with SR-65 near East Canyon State Park in Morgan County, where it winds to the west along the northern end of the park and East Canyon Reservoir. Heading away from the park, the route turns northwest as it travels through East Canyon, alongside East Canyon Creek.
As the canyon starts opens up and turn to the north, the route continues to follow, passing through Porterville and Richville. Eventually, as East Canyon merges with Weber Canyon, the route enters the city of Morgan] Here, the route intersects I-84, and immediately thereafter takes a right turn to the southeast, travelling approximately 3/4 mile as it parallels the north side of I-84, terminating at the next interchange.
History.
State Route 66 was formed on 12 May 1931, connecting the town of Hardscrabble north to Porterville and Morgan. In 1953, the connection from Porterville to Hardscrabble was relinquished from state control. In 1969, the road from Porterville south to the East Canyon Reservoir was transferred from county to state control as a part of an SR-66 extension.

Rs5569

In genetics, rs5569 (A1287G or G1287A) is a genetic variant.
It is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the "SLC6A2" gene in exon 9.
This gene codes the norepinephrine transporter.
The SNP is a silent substitution and
the nucleotides of both variants code a threonine amino acid.
Several research studies have examined the effect of the variant in relation to alcohol dependence,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
diabetes,
major depressive disorder,
panic disorder,
Tourette syndrome
and personality traits.
None of the studies have found an association.

Upper Gage Avenue (Hamilton, Ontario)

Upper Gage Avenue is an Upper City (mountain) arterial road in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It starts off at Concession Street in front of "Mountain Drive Park" and works its way southward and ends just past Rymal Road beside "Broughton West Park 2". It is a two-way street throughout. As with most of the "Upper" streets, their addresses start at roughly the point where their lower counterpart finishes just below the Escarpment and were originally labelled without the "Upper" prefix.
History.
Named Upper Gage Avenue because it is in approximate alignment with Gage Avenue in the Lower City Hamilton. Gage Avenue is named after James Gage, a lumber merchant and his uncle "William Gage", a farmer. Together James and William had a farm that was the site of the Battle of Stoney Creek during the War of 1812. The wounded were treated inside their home and they were both awarded compensation for it by the government. Originally Gage Street was called "Trolley Street".

Daniels, et al. v. the City of New York

Daniels, et al. v. the City of New York was a class action lawsuit filed in 1999 against the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the City of New York, charging them with racial profiling and unlawful stop and frisk, and requesting the disbanding of the NYPD Street Crimes Unit.
Background.
In February 1999, the Amadou Diallo shooting brought increased attention to the issue of police brutality. NYPD records showed that in 1997 and 1998, 35,000 out of 45,000 stop-and-frisks did not result in an arrest. The statistics showed that 16 African Americans were stopped for every arrest made. These statistics represented a small proportion of NYPD officers, members of the NYPD Street Crimes Unit, which brought calls for the Unit to be disbanded.
History.
The Daniels et al. v. The City of New York et al. was brought to the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) by Richie Perez of the National Congress of Puerto Rican Rights during the aftermath of the Diallo shooting.
The defendants initially argued to dismiss the case, citing a 1983 Supreme Court decision, City of Los Angeles v. Lyons. The court denied the dismissal.
The court also denied the plaintiffs' Equal Protection clause claim, as they set a racial classification, stating that the Street Crimes Unit had a "policy, practice and/or custom of stopping and frisking based solely on [their race and/or national origin."
The City agreed to a settlement on December 12, 2003.
Terms of settlement.
The settlement required that the NYPD maintain a written anti-racial-profiling policy that complies with the U.S. and New York State Constitutions and is binding on all NYPD officers. The policy requires that officers who engage in stop-and-frisks be audited, and for their supervisors to determine whether, and to what extent, the act was due to reasonable suspicion, and whether it was being documented.
The audits were then to be given to the Center for Constitutional Rights on a quarterly basis. Furthermore, the NYPD was required to engage in public education efforts, which included joint public meetings with class members and representatives on its racial profiling policy, and workshops at approximately 50 highs on a student's rights when being frisked.
Results.
Due to an increase in stop-and-frisks and non-compliance with the decree, the Center for Constitutional Rights later filed a new class action lawsuit, Floyd, et al. v. City of New York, et al..

Kayla Hoffman

Kayla Marie Hoffman (born August 13, 1988) is an American
artistic gymnast born in Summit, New Jersey and later residing in Union, New Jersey. After deciding to retire from elite gymnastics in 2007, she is currently a member of the University of Alabama gymnastics team.
Personal life.
Hoffman was born August 13, 1988 to parents Richard and Helen Hoffman in Summit, New Jersey. She has one sister, Emma Lee Hoffman, who also is a competitive gymnast. She began taking gymnastics at the young age of three because her mother took gymnastics when she was younger as well. Hoffman was home schooled through her high school career.
Until reaching level 10, Hoffman spent her beginning years at Sunburst Gymnastics. She won the uneven bars title at Level 8 State and in 2000, she qualified for the Level 9 Easterns and finished 4th overall. In 2001, she placed 3rd at Level 10 Regionals and qualified for the JO Nationals. At the end of the year, she decided to make a change and began training at Rebound Gymnastics for Coach Diane Farrell.
Career.
In 2003, Hoffman started her season at Friendship classic as a junior and finished 3rd in the all-around. In 2004, she qualified for the international elite level and qualified for the US National Championships. Unfortunately, she could not compete at the US National Championships due to an injury.
In 2005, she again easily qualified for the international elite level. When Hoffman went to the National Team Training Camp in February, the coaches were impressed with her gymnastics and qualified her straight to the US National Championships. She used the US Classic as a warm up for the upcoming US National Championships. She finished 19th in the all-around. At Hoffman’s first US National Championships, she impressed many people with her power on floor exercise and vault. She placed 8th in the all-around.
Her 2006 season began at the Friendship Classic in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. She placed 2nd in the all-around. Just a week after the Friendship Classic, Hoffman got selected as one of two senior gymnasts to represent the USA for the 2006 Moscow World Cup in May qualifying for two event finals on the first competition at the World Cup. She was 2nd on bars and 4th on floor exercise. Unfortunately, she fell on both of her events during the finals and placed seventh on both. By using the US Classic in Kansas City, Missouri as a warm up for the upcoming US National Championships, she placed 10th in the all-around. Hoffman made the Senior US National Team for the second time in row after tying for 11th in the all-around. She was invited to go to the World Selection Camp and was invited back to the second camp. However, she could not go to the second camp due to a hamstring injury.
Collegiate career.
In 2007, Hoffman made the decision to retire from elite gymnastics, so she could focus on her first year at the University of Alabama. Hoffman and her Alabama teammates started their season in January 2008 competing against Illinois, where she finished 2nd in the all-around. She helped the team to win nine competitions throughout the season, including the South Central Regional Championship. She won seven vault titles as well as six floor exercise titles. At the NCAA Championships, the Alabama gymnastics team advanced to the Super Six and finished 6th. Hoffman qualified to vault finals, where she placed 5th. After her regular season was over, statistics showed that she was ranked 5th on vault, 33rd on uneven bars, and 18th on floor exercise. She also earned All-American honors and was named to the inaugural SEC All-Freshman team as well as earning second team All-Sec. Her first semester at the University of Alabama, she earned a 4.0 grade point average while still maintaining her gymnastics training. More so impressive was that was her first classroom experience since third grade when she started being home schooled. In 2011, Kayla clinched the Women's Collegiate Gymnastics National Championship Title with a 9.95 score on her floor routine. It was the team's first championship since winning in 2002.

Tenino Depot

The Tenino Depot, located in Tenino, Washington, was built by the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1914 along the mainline from Portland, Oregon to Tacoma, Washington. 
The depot is rectangular in shape and is made out of the local sandstone. (The sandstone quarry located east of the rail line was also listed in the National Register of Historic Places.) The architecture is a modernized Richardsonian style with simplified stone coursework and arched windows. The depot had a passenger waiting area on one end and a freight room on the other. The agent's office was located between the two rooms. 
The depot ceased serving passengers in the 1950s, but continued to handle freight into the 1960s. It was finally closed in 1965. The depot remained abandoned. In 1975, the Burlington Northern Railroad (the successor of the Northern Pacific) gave the depot to the City of Tenino instead of demolishing it as a surplus property. The city then moved it alongside an old Northern Pacific branchline, adjacent to the old sandstone quarry. 
The city refurbished the depot and turned it into the Tenino Depot Museum, a museum of local history. Exhibits include a press used to make the original wood money, logging and quarry tools, railroad memorabilia, a 1920s doctor's office, and local antiques and historic artifacts. The museum is open weekend afternoons.
The depot was listed in the National Register due to its association with the development of Tenino as well as its association with the development of railroads in Washington.

Kurt Wintgens

"Leutnant" Kurt Wintgens (1 August 1894 – 25 September 1916) was a German World War I fighter ace. He was the first military fighter pilot to score a victory over an opposing aircraft, while piloting an aircraft armed with a synchronized machine gun. Wintgens was the recipient of the Iron Cross and the Blue Max.
Background.
Wintgens was born into a military family in Neustadt in Oberschlesien (today's Prudnik). His military service commenced when he joined the Telegraphen-Bataillon Nr. 2 in Frankfurt/Oder as a "Fahnenjunker" (cadet officer) in 1913.
Involvement in 1st World War.
Though still in military school when the war began in 1914, Wintgens was sent to the Eastern Front as a leutnant and won the Iron Cross, 2nd Class. On transferring to the German Air Service, Wintgens flew first as an observer, apparently alternating with telegraph duty. However, in early 1915 he entered pilot training at the Fokker school in Schwerin, where "Leutnant" Otto Parschau had already been brought in by the Fokker factory to prepare an example of an armed (with a Parabellum MG14 synchronized gun) version of the Fokker A.III single-seat monoplane, with serial number "A.16/15" (the very same "green machine" aircraft that Parschau had flown since the summer of 1914) for front-line trials. Wintgens specifically requested the chance "to fly in the field the smallest and fastest Fokker type with the Garros-installation, which enabled a built-in machine gun to fire through the propeller." With that background he was selected, along with Leutnant Parschau, as one of the first Fokker Eindecker pilots, flying single-seaters that had been assigned to fly alone with various two-seater-equipped field flying detachments, starting with the Bavarian Feldflieger Abteilung 6b, then based near Saarburg.
In the early summer of 1915, the initial deployments of Fokker Eindecker fighter planes began. These were carried out only with single aircraft, with each one attached to established Feldflieger Abteilung two-seat observation aircraft units, each unit normally equipped with six two-seaters apiece.
Wintgens was one of the very few frontline military fighter pilots to ever be allowed to wear prescription eyewear while flying in combat, as he wore "hard-bridge" style pince-nez glasses for vision correction, under his pilot's goggles. The practice seems to have been limited almost exclusively to the Luftstreitkräfte.
First victory using a synchronized gun.
Wintgens holds a unique pioneering role in the history of aerial combat, being the first fighter pilot to down an enemy aircraft using a synchronized gun. On July 1, 1915, Leutnant Wintgens was flying the last-produced example of the five Fokker M.5K/MG production prototype Eindecker aircraft, with German military serial number "E.5/15", and at 18:00 that evening he engaged a Morane-Saulnier Type L "Parasol" two-seater. The French aircraft was most likely from Escadrille M.S.48, and flown by one Capitaine Paul du Peuty, with Sous-Lieutenant de Boutiny as the observer. The French aviators reported that they were engaged by a "Fokker Monoplane" at 1,300 meters over the Fôret de Parroy, near the village of Lunéville. The French aircraft was armed with only a carbine, while the Fokker had a forward-firing, synchronized Parabellum MG14 machine gun. After a few minutes of combat with the Fokker, de Peuty was wounded in the lower right leg. The Eindecker seemed to have been hit by de Boutiny's carbine fire. De Boutiny had exhausted all of his carbine ammunition, leaving his own aircraft defenseless, which gave the Eindecker the advantage, and shortly thereafter the Eindecker likewise wounded de Boutiny in the leg. Despite their injuries, the French aircrew landed their Morane Parasol safely, in friendly territory, although their own engine had been hit by E.5/15's machine gun fire, with the combat taking place in the Lorraine sector. However, because the Morane landed in Allied territory, Wintgens was not credited with an official victory. Wintgens would down another "Parasol" in similar circumstances three days later, again unconfirmed.
Subsequent actions.
A fortnight after his initial success, Wintgens was posted to Feld Flieger Abteilung 48, based at Mülhausen im Elsaß, within the much-disputed Alsace border region of northeast France, that had been annexed by the Reich in 1871. On July 15, Wintgens scored his first "recognized" aerial victory, still flying his E.5/15 Eindecker, and once again downing a Morane Parasol for this victory - the very first "official" victory by an Eindecker pilot, and the first confirmed victory using a synchronized machine gun. Wintgens' victory was the very first for his unit, and earned him an Iron Cross First Class.
He followed up with two more confirmed victories in 1915, as well as an unconfirmed one on 24 January 1916. Wintgens then suffered from a lingering case of influenza that kept him from flying. He would not score again until 20 May 1916, when he shot down a two-seater Nieuport while flying for FFA 6. The following day, the engines of the Caudron he downed augered a meter and a half in the earth after a 4,000 meter crash. Needless to note, the crew did not survive.
On June 24, 1916, Wintgens (possibly flying a Halberstadt D.II) achieved his seventh confirmed victory when he confronted a Nieuport 16, flown by the then-wounded Lafayette Escadrille American pilot Victor Chapman, who had been wounded by fellow Eindecker pilot Walter Höhndorf just a week earlier. Chapman was killed in the crash, the first American fighter aviator flying in World War I to lose his life in an aerial engagement.
Shortly afterwards, on 1 July 1916, Wintgens became the fourth airman to receive the 'Blue Max', after he had completed the required (at the time) eight victories over enemy aircraft. Wintgens continued to score throughout the summer and into the autumn. He continued to use the Fokker E.IV even as his contemporaries upgraded; Hans-Joachim Buddecke's writings mention Wintgens blipping the Fokker's rotary engine on and off as a signal to waiting squadron members that a flight had been victorious. As he entered September, Wintgens remained the third-ranking Eindecker ace, behind Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann, with some 14 victories in the Fokker monoplane.
On 25 September, Wintgens flew his E.IV on patrol along with his friend Walter Höhndorf. It is claimed that they went to the assistance of a two-seater flown by Josef Veltjens, which was under attack by French scouts. After downing at least 19 aircraft (with probables and force-downs, as high as 22) in air combat, Wintgens was killed in action near Villers-Carbonnel, probably by French ace Alfred Heurteaux, for Heurteaux's eighth aerial victory.[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/france/heurtaux.php] Heurteaux was most likely flying one of the early examples of the SPAD S.VII fighter. Höhndorf rushed back to base to sorrowfully report that Wintgens' plane broke up under the impact of "explosive bullets". Josef Jacobs remarked in his diary that recovery of Wintgens' body from no man's land was difficult. Buddecke blamed the crash on a severed elevator spar, and noted that Wintgens showed no bullet wounds. Two days later, Wintgens was laid to rest in the same French graveyard that already contained the body of his fellow Fokker Eindecker pioneering pilot, Otto Parschau.

1908 college football season

The 1908 IAAUS football season ran from Saturday, September 19, until November 28. The Penn Quakers and the Harvard Crimson both finished the season unbeaten, though each had been tied once during the season. The LSU Tigers went unbeaten and untied against a weaker opposition. All three teams were named national champions retroactively by various organizations. Only Pennsylvania officially claims a national championship for the 1908 season.
Although there was no provision for a national championship, major teams played their regular schedules before facing their most difficult matches late in the season. "The real championship contests are ushered in with the month of November," the "New York Times" reported on September 6, "and on the seventh day of that month the final try-outs will be witnessed." The most eagerly anticipated games were Yale at Princeton (November 14) and Harvard at Yale (November 21). In addition, "intersectional games" were of special interest, with Cornell at Chicago, and Penn at Michigan.
Rules.
"With the modernized plays that are being brought into the game," noted one writer, "football is, in its present state, the national game in the fall the same as baseball in the summer.". Rules for the forward pass, which had been legalized only two years earlier, were modified, and passing was still a risky play. "If the ball on the forward pass is touched and then freed, and is touched by another player on the passer's side, it will be given to the opponents at the point where the ball was illegally touched," and it was noted that the rule change was to stop the practice of a passer throwing the ball high "with the hopes that some one of his teammates would get the ball in the general scramble that followed,". In addition, halftime was extended from ten minutes to fifteen 
The rules for American football in 1908 were significantly different than the ones of a century later, as many of the present rules (100 yard field, four downs to gain ten yards, 6-point touchdown and the 3-point field goal) would not be adopted until 1912. The rules in 1908 were:

<doc id="19428626" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19428626" title="William G. Pollard">
William G. Pollard

William Grosvenor Pollard (1911–1989) was a physicist and an Episcopal priest. He started his career as a professor of physics in 1936 at University of Tennessee. In 1946 he championed the organization of the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies (ORINS). He was its executive director until 1974. He was ordained as a priest in 1954. He authored and co-authored a significant amount of material in the areas of Christianity and Science and Religion found in books, book chapters, and journal articles. He was sometimes referred to as the "atomic deacon."
Life.
He was born in Batavia, NY. His father, Arthur L. Pollard, a mining engineer and bacteriologist, moved the family to Knoxville, Tennessee when Pollard was twelve. Pollard had been raised in the Episcopal faith, but in high-school ventured into the Unitarian Church. After three years, he also gave that up. After marriage in 1932, he again began to attend Episcopal services. He received an A.B. from University of Tennessee in 1932; an M.A. and Ph.D. from Rice University in 1934 and 1935, respectively. His thesis was entitled "On the Theory of Beta-Ray Type of Radio-active Disintegration." In 1936 he joined the University of Tennessee as a faculty member, becoming a full professor in 1943.
Manhattan Project.
In 1944 under the cover of Columbia University's Special Alloys and Metals Laboratory, he was asked to join the Manhattan Project. He did research on a gaseous diffusion extraction method of U-235 from common uranium. He initially worked at Columbia University's Pupin Physics Laboratories.
Ordination.
He was ordained on Ember Wednesday, December 17, 1952. His four sons, then aged 10 to 17, served as acolytes. Numerous scientists and employees from Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies attended along with several reporters and photographers.
Position on the relation of religion and science.
Pollard's position on the relation of religion and science involves God acting through quantum indeterminacy. His position is thought to be similar to that of Karl Heim, J.J. Thomson, Arthur Compton, George Thomson, E. T. Whittaker, and Eric Mascall.
Continuing influence.
The book "The Frontiers of Science & Faith: Examining Questions from the Big Bang to the End of the Universe" (2002) credits Pollard in making important contributions to a significant train of thought on religion and quantum indeterminacy that has led to further ideas about religion and chaos theory. Chapter 5 of Divine Action and Modern Science (Cambridge University Press, 2002) is divided into three sections: "Pre-Pollard quantum SDA", "William Pollard", and "Post-Pollard quantum SDA".
Fiftieth anniversary of Kent School.
At an ecumenical seminary held in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of Kent School (1955), Pollard was one of eight distinguished speakers giving talks on "The Christian Idea of Education". According to acting "New York Times" reporter Edward N. West, a Canon of New York Cathedral St. John the Divine and author of "Mediations on the Gospel of St. John", "the speakers were as distinguished as authentic Christianity produces." Other speakers included Princeton University historian and Presbyterian layman E. Harris Harbison, "Cry, The Beloved Country" author and Anglican layman Alan Paton, Professor of Liturgics and Episcopal priest Massey H. Shepherd, Roman Catholic priest John Courtney Murray, Roman Catholic layman and then professor emeritus of Princeton University Jacques Maritain, Russian Orthodox priest and then Harvard University professor Georges Florovsky, and Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. According to Canon West, "These contributors are so excellent, the thinking on so high a level, that any intelligent reader will be excited. The Christian position has never been better stated." Pollard and Edmund Fuller co-edited the results of this seminary, which were published as "The Christian idea of education: papers and discussions" (Yale University Press, 1958).

<doc id="19428718" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19428718" title="George Aribert of Anhalt-Dessau">
George Aribert of Anhalt-Dessau

George Aribert of Anhalt-Dessau (Dessau, 3 June 1606 – Wörlitz, 14 November 1643), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and (titular) ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Dessau.
He was the sixth son of John George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, but the fourth-born son of his second wife Dorothea, daughter of John Casimir of Simmern. In fact, he was the second and youngest son of John George and Dorothea who survived adulthood; two of his older brothers, Frederick Maurice and Henry Waldemar, died in infancy.
Life.
After the death of his father in 1618, the twelve-year-old George Aribert was put under the custody of his older brother John Casimir. Nominally, the young prince was co-ruler with his brother, but he never took real part in the government of Dessau.
In 1619 Georg Aribert was accepted by his uncle Louis of Anhalt-Köthen in the Fruitbearing Society. The Bitter orange tree was chosen as his emblem.
George Aribert performed military service in the Imperial army with Christoph Albrecht von Zanthierfrom 1625 to 1629.
After thirteen years of "co-government" between him and John Casimir, a treaty was signed on 28 January 1632 that divided the territories of Anhalt-Dessau; George Aribert took possession of just a few locations: Wörlitz (which he chose as his residence), Radegast, and Kleutsch.
Marriage and issue.
Around 1632 George Aribert decided to marry Johanna Elisabeth (Anna?) von Krosigk (d. aft. 1686), of old nobility and daughter of Christoph von Krosigk, ""Cammerrath, Marschall und Hauptmann in Diensten"" at the court of his brother John Casimir.
This decision created many difficulties with his relatives, who were totally against the union. However, on 10 February 1637 they finally concluded a formal agreement to accept the union as morganatic.
Under the terms of the contract, the prince's wife would obtain all the rights of a legitimate spouse, but she was maintained in her rank as member of the old nobility, without raising her to princely rank, comital, or baronial nobility. George Aribert also promised not to ask the Emperor to elevate her status.
The children of the marriage were to be nobles only, and bear the name "von Aribert"; they were denied any rights to princely name, title, or arms, and also excluded from the succession to Anhalt. Nevertless, were assigned certain estates as well as a rent of 45,000 Thalers. The Estates ("Landstände") of Anhalt-Dessau confirmed the contract the next day and promised never to recognize anyone excluded by the contract as prince or princess.
One month later, on 7 March 1637, George Aribert finally married Johanna Elisabeth. They had five children:
George Aribert died at the age of only thirty-seven; all of his lands reverted to Anhalt-Dessau.
Nevertheless, some years later (in 1660) his son Christian Aribert wrote to his cousin John George (son of John Casimir) to dispute the validity of his parents' contract with their relatives and claim the rank of Prince of Anhalt. The Emperor issued a rescript to the princes of Anhalt in 1661 where he claimed that he wanted to uphold the contract but could not deny justice to Christian Aribert.
In the end, Duke Ernest of Saxe-Gotha offered mediation, and an agreement was reached on 6 February 1671 with the Princes of Anhalt. The agreement gave Christian Aribert the title "Count of Bähringen, Lord of Waldersee and Radegast," and allowed him to style himself "Legitimate and only son of Prince George Aribert of Anhalt." For arms, he was allowed to use the traditional bear of Anhalt impaling Waldersee. Also, his two surviving sisters Sophie and Eleonore were created "Countesses of Bähringen."
No opposition would be made to his elevation to the rank of prince, as long as it was not to that of Prince of Anhalt. In case of the extinction of the entire House of Anhalt in all male lines, there would be no opposition to him or his male-line legitimate heirs making a claim to the principality. However, Christian Aribert died unmarried and childless in 1677; his two sisters both married at advanced ages and died without issue.

Harald Arbin

Gustaf Harald Arbin (ne "Andersson", August 4, 1867 – July 31, 1944) was a Swedish diver, track and field athlete, and rower. He competed in diving at the 1908 Summer Olympics and 1912 Summer Olympics.
He was born and died in Gothenburg. In 1908 he was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 10 metre platform event. Four years later he finished sixth in the 10 metre platform competition of the 1912 Games. He was affiliated with Simklubben S02 during his sporting career.
He won Swedish titles in several track and field disciplines, including the 100 metres, 110 metres hurdles, long jump and javelin throw. He broke Swedish records in the 100 m (10.8 seconds), 200 metres (26.4 seconds) and the long jump (6.03 metres). His performance of 10.8 seconds for the 100 m, set in Helsingborg in 1896, ranked as an unofficial world record for the distance. This stood until 1906, when fellow Swede Knut Lindberg recorded a time of 10.6 seconds.

Deep Dish is a 2008 romance novel by the American writer Mary Kay Andrews.
Plot.
Gina is a 30 year old chef obsessed with using fresh, wholesome, high-quality ingredients in the food she prepares. Her cooking show is cancelled when a big sponsor pulls out after seeing the show's producer in bed with the sponsor's wife. This cancellation creates an opportunity for a new show on the Cooking Channel. The producers are also interested in a local cooking show called Vittles, hosted by Tate Moody. The producers decide to turn the competition between Gina and Tate into a reality show.
Reception.
A Publishers Weekly review says, "The close quarters and competition create the right atmosphere for the two chefs to fall in love, though things never get too racy. Andrews takes a long time to get the romance off the ground, but when it starts moving, it moves fast.". Shelley Mosley, of Library Journal, reviewed the book saying, "Readers with a taste for delectable culinary romances like Millie Criswell's "The Trouble with Mary", Susan Mallery's "Delicious", and Deirdre Martin's "Just a Taste" will enjoy "Deep Dish". Sarrah Knight, of The Romance Reader, reviewed the book saying, "As always, Andrews has delivered a mouth-watering novel that, while it doesn't move the way her previous novels have, is sure to satisfy".

Development.
Tagami rose to prominence in 1998 as a real estate developer when, utilizing a combination of his tireless pursuit and political support, he and his partners secured the right to renovate the historic Liberty House department store situated across the street from Oakland's City Hall. The $50 million renovations to the building that followed produced the Rotunda, which according to a 2005 article in the "San Francisco Business Times" was "widely regarded as the city's most attractive office complex." Other prominent restorations spearheaded by Tagami include the Fox Theater and the historic West Oakland train station.
In 2009, Tagami and the California Capital Group were endorsed by a committee chosen by Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums to redevelop of the former Oakland Army Base. The base was divided in 2002, with given to the city of Oakland and 168 to the Port of Oakland. Tagami, in conjunction with the San Francisco maritime developer AMB, is also a front-runner for the port's renovation project.

Tagami served as an Oakland Planning Commissioner appointed by Mayor Elihu Harris.
Subsequently, Tagami earned a further reputation as a power broker, with particularly close connections to Jerry Brown, Grey Davis and Don Perata.
Brown appointed Tagami to the Board of Commissioners of the Port of Oakland, where he served from 2000-2003.
Tagami went on to serve as a world trade commissioner and a state parks commissioner for Governor Grey Davis.
In 2005, as Brown was preparing to leave the mayoral office, Tagami indicated that he was considering running for public office, possibly starting with City Council before putting in a bid to serve Oakland as mayor.
In 2008, Tagami attracted media attention when he publicly requested that the city council revise the city charter to require weekly timesheets from the mayor, demonstrating that the mayor serves a 40-hour workweek. This announcement followed on allegations by KTVU news that for a third of record workday Mayor Ron Dellum's calendar could only verify his working four hours or less. Tagami announced that he was considering a spring 2010 ballot if the city council did not alter the charter.
In 2011, Tagami brandished a shotgun at Black Bloc rioters inside the Rotunda building during an Occupy Oakland demonstration.
In 2011, Tagami was appointed to the California Lottery by Governor Jerry Brown. In May 2012 other lottery comisisoners voted Tagami Chairmen of the Lottery for a one year term.
