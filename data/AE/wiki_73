John Hungerford Pollen (Jesuit)

John Hungerford Pollen (1858-1925) was an English Jesuit, known as a historian of the Protestant Reformation.
Life.
He was one of the group of Jesuit historians restoring the reputation of Robert Persons. He was influential in the history of the term "Counter-Reformation", accepting for the Catholic side the appellation for the period of Catholic reform centred on the Council of Trent, but at the same time offering an interpretation that made it less reactive, in relation to the Protestant Reformation. These ideas were put forth in the 1908 "Catholic Encyclopedia" article he wrote on the subject.
He was a correspondent of Georg Cantor, from 1896 and an active member of the Catholic Record Society (founded 1904).
Family.
John Hungerford Pollen (senior) was his father.

Ministry of Health (Democratic Republic of the Congo)

The Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a public health system based loosely on the historical Belgian colonial public health system. The MOH is largely a policy and oversight organization with operational functions embodied within a number of subordinate MOH organizations, including the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Institute of Biomedical Research ("Institut National de Recherché Biomédicale", or INRB) and the Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH). KSPH trains physicians in public health, staffs the public health infrastructure composed of Health Zones, including the Health Zone doctors who provide both public health services and partial staffing of district hospitals. 
As of November 2012, the Health Minister in DRC was Dr. Félix Kabange Numbi.

Greater Portugal

Greater Portugal, also known as Portugalicia, is an idea of some Portuguese nationalists, which aims to unify the Portuguese-speaking territories outside the actual frontiers of Portugal, that includes the autonomous region of Galicia, the Eonavian region, the territory of Olivença, many villages along the border that speak any kind of Portuguese-Galician dialect, such as the Fala language. The archipelagos of Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe are also part of this idea. 
The concept of a Greater Portugal has its origins during the Portuguese Age of Discoveries, when Portuguese navigators and explorers discovered previously uninhabited lands such as the Madeira Islands, Savage Islands, Azores, Cape Verde, the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe and several other lands in the Atlantic.
Though the concept of a Greater Portugal is thought to be a recent political ideology held by some Portuguese nationalists, such a concept indeed dates back much further and was recorded by the English author, George Young in his 1917 book entitled: "Portugal, Old and Young - an Historical Study", published by Oxford University Press:
""In other words, the foundations of a Portuguese Republic were laid when Vasco da Gama made the Monarchy an autocracy by pouring into its pockets the wealth of the Indies, and when the Portuguese viceroys founded the Greater Portugal overseas"."
During the 19th century, Greater Portugal lost one of its most prized possessions – Brazil, which was mainly caused by the unsuccessful invasion of Portugal by both Spain and France. In the 20th century, certain regions of Greater Portugal were elevated in importance and promoted for increased immigration. Others such as the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, were of great strategic importance and make an appearance in German documents during the Second World War on August 24, 1940.
Current use.
The term Portugalicia is still preserved in a number of political initiatives. Although the boundaries of Portugalicia are not strictly defined, some proponents portray them as encompassing the following areas:

Master of the Legend of the Magdalen

The Master of the Legend of the Magdalen (sometimes called the Master of the Magdalen Legend) was an Early Netherlandish painter, active from about 1483 to around 1527. He has not been identified; his name of convenience is derived from a large, now-dispersed altarpiece, which has been dated to between 1515 and 1520 based on the costumes of the donor figures. However other works attributed to him are extremely difficult to date with any accuracy. Many paintings have been linked with the triptych, which is though to have been finished late in the artist's career. Other major works include his two Magdalen panels in London.
Some of his portraits suggest a possible link with artists in Brussels, and it is thought that he worked there, and headed a large workshop. An early influence appears to have been Rogier van der Weyden; his work also shares characteristics with that of Bernard van Orley, and a link with the Master of the Death of the Virgin has been suggested. Like van Orley, this artist is believed to have been active in the court of Margaret of Habsburg, regent of the Netherlands from 1507 until 1530. Works ascribed to the Master are in the collections of the National Gallery, London, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
He is sometimes associated with Pieter van Coninxloo based on similarities of style, time and location. A number of art historians, including Max Friedländer, who first made the association between the works now attributed to the Master of the Legend of the Magdalen, have speculated that they may have been the same person. It is possible also that van Coninxloo for a time was a member of the master's workshop.

Mode.
The tournament consisted of seven single elimination rounds. In case a game ended with a draw 30 minutes of extra time were played. If the score was still level the game was replayed with 30 minutes of extra time in case of another draw. If still no winner could be determined, a penalty shooutout decided which team advanced to the next round.
For the first time the final was not to be replayed in case of a draw after 120 minutes. In that case a penalty shootout would decide the winner of the DFB-Pokal.

<doc id="19686742" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19686742" title="Electronic prescribing">
Electronic prescribing

Electronic prescribing or e-prescribing (e-Rx) is the computer-based electronic generation, transmission and filling of a medical prescription, taking the place of paper and faxed prescriptions. E-prescribing allows a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant to electronically transmit a new prescription or renewal authorization to a community or mail-order pharmacy. It outlines the ability to send error-free, accurate, and understandable prescriptions electronically from the healthcare provider to the pharmacy. E-prescribing is meant to reduce the risks associated with traditional prescription script writing. It is also one of the major reasons for the push for electronic medical records. By sharing medical prescription information, e-prescribing seeks to connect the patient's team of healthcare providers to facilitate knowledgeable decision making.
Functions.
A "qualified" e-prescribing system must be capable of performing all of the following functions:
Electronic Prescribing Services.
Many electronic prescribing services and software exist in the market. A certified, cloud-based e-prescription platform is available from MPR, a point-of-care drug information reference owned by Haymarket Media, Inc.
Model.
The basic components of an electronic prescribing system are the:
The PBM and transaction hub work closely together. The PBM works as an intermediate actor to ensure accuracy of information, although other models may not include this to streamline the communication process.
Prescriber.
The prescriber, generally a clinician or health care staff, are defined as the electronic prescribing system user and sign into the system through a verification process to authenticate their identity.
The prescriber searches through the database of patient records by using patient-specific information such as first and last name, date of birth, current address etc. Once the correct patient file has been accessed, the prescriber reviews the current medical information and uploads or updates new prescription information to the medical file.
Transaction hub.
The transaction hub provides the common link between all actors (prescriber, pharmacy benefit manager, and pharmacy). It stores and maintains a master patient index for quick access to their medical information as well as a list of pharmacies.
When the prescriber uploads new prescription information to the patient file, this is sent to the transaction hub. The transaction hub will verify against the patient index. This will automatically send information about this transaction to the PBM, who will respond to the hub with information on patient eligibility, formulary, and medication history back to the transaction hub. The transaction hub then sends this information to the prescriber to improve patient management and care by completing and authorizing the prescription. Upon which, the prescription information is sent to the pharmacy that the patient primarily goes to.
Pharmacy.
When the pharmacy receives the prescription information from the transaction hub, it will send a confirmation message. The pharmacy also has the ability to communicate to the prescriber that the prescription order has been filled through the system. Further system development will soon allow different messages such as a patient not picking up their medication or is late to pick up medication to improve patient management.
Benefits.
E-prescribing offers clinicians a powerful tool for safely and efficiently managing their patient's medications. Compared to paper-based prescribing, e-prescribing can enhance patient safety and medication compliance, improve prescribing accuracy and efficiency, and reduce health care costs through averted adverse drug events and substitution of less expensive drug alternatives. This is of key importance because in 2000, the Institute of Medicine identified medication errors as the most common type of medical error in health care, estimating that this leads to several thousand deaths each year. E-prescribing also has the potential to improve beneficiary health outcomes. For providers who choose to invest in e-prescribing technology, the adoption could improve quality and efficiency and could show promise in reducing costs by actively promoting appropriate drug usage; providing information to providers and dispensers about formulary-based drug coverage, including formulary alternatives and co-pay information; and speeding up the process of renewing medications. E-prescribing also may play a significant role in efforts to reduce the incidence of drug diversion by alerting providers and pharmacists of duplicative prescriptions for controlled substances.
More specifically, the benefits of e-prescribing to both patients and clinicians include:
Limitations.
Although e-prescribing has the ability to streamline workflow process and increase the system's efficiency, the appropriate tools are required in the appropriate contextual setting. As with various sectors however, change can be difficult. Previous errors may be addressed, but the adoption and implementation of new technology does not come without drawbacks.
Challenges and limitations that may hinder the widespread adoption of e-prescribing practices are addressed below:
Policy and Standards.
United States.
In the United States, the HITECH Act promotes adoption of this technology by defining e-prescribing as one meaningful use of an electronic medical record. Standards for transmitting, recording, and describing prescriptions have been developed by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, in particular the SCRIPT standard, which describes data formats. Elsewhere in the world, health care systems have been slower to adopt e-prescribing standards.
Adoption of e-prescribing technology has accelerated in the United States, in large part, due to the arrival of Stage 2 of meaningful use. One of the Stage 2 core measures is: "Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically (e-Rx.)" In order to meet this measure, practices must prescribe and transmit at least 50 percent of permissible prescriptions electronically.
According to data released in May 2012 by SureScripts, a company which operates the nation's largest health information (e-prescribing) network, roughly 317,000 office-based physicians now e-prescribe in the United States.
A more recent report released by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT in June 2012 finds that 48 percent of U.S. physicians use e-prescribing systems. National growth in e-prescribing over the period September 2008 through June 2012 increased over 40 percent, with individual states increasing adoption anywhere from 28 percent to 70 percent.
Canada.
Until recently in Canada, it was the position of Health Canada that, to allow for e-prescribing, amendments to Part C of the Food and Drugs Regulations made under the Food and Drugs Act, regulations made under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possibly regulations made under Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act would be required. After further review, Health Canada has concluded that there are currently no regulatory impediments to moving ahead with electronically generated and transmitted prescriptions and that these are permissible to the extent that they achieve the same objectives as written prescriptions. Provinces and territories wishing to proceed with e-prescribing are obligated to ensure that electronic prescriptions meet existing regulatory requirements and achieve the same objectives as written prescriptions. For example, there must be evidence of a genuine practitioner/patient relationship, and in the case of controlled substances, pharmacists filling prescriptions must verify prescriptions are signed by the practitioner before selling or providing drugs containing controlled substances to a patient. Health Canada has collaborated with Canada Health Infoway on the development of a technical document entitled Ensuring the Authenticity of Electronic Prescriptions, in order to provide advice about how to ensure the authenticity of electronic signatures.
Electronic Prescribing Worldwide.
Europe.
The use of electronic prescription has been designated as an important strategic policy to improve health care in Europe. The aim of the European Union is to have a cross-border electronic healthcare system in Europe which will enable EU citizens to obtain e-Prescriptions anywhere in Europe. The Scandinavian countries are leading Europe in deploying e-Prescription. Electronic prescriptions were introduced in Estonia in January 2010 and by mid-2013, 95% of all prescriptions in the country were being issued electronically. Other countries which use the prescription process routinely are Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Iceland, Greece, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The European Union is pushing for more cross border health data exchange. Despite favourable attitudes towards cross border e-Prescriptions, multiple perceived barriers impede its incorporation in clinical practice. There are varying interpretations and implementations of data protection and confidentiality laws in the 27 member states. Infrastructures are not in place to support the system and stakeholders in some jurisdictions are reluctant to embrace e-health due to the high cost and the lack of security of the systems. Member states have varying degrees of health care policy, privacy enforcement and laws concerning data protection, telecommunication services and digital signature with regards to e-Prescription. Interoperability of different systems is only a partial solution. Security and enforcement of privacy must also be equally enforced.

The Federal District buildings are two buildings on the south side of the Zócalo in Mexico City divided by the avenue "Avenida 20 de Noviembre". They house offices of the governing authority of the Federal District or Mexico City. The building to the west of "20 de Noviembre" is the older one and has been the site of city administration since the Conquest. The one to the east is newer, built in 20th century.
Federal District.
Similar to other capital cities, like Washington, D.C., Mexico City is considered as belonging to the nation, rather than being part of a particular state. What is now the federal district used to be principally part of the State of Mexico until 1824, when the Mexican Congress decided to put the capital in Mexico City. At the time, the State of Mexico had its headquarters in the old Palace of the Inquisition (Now the Museum of Medicine) but then had to move to Texcoco. The government of Mexico City and the Federal District are one and the same, causing Mexicans to use the terms interchangeably. While it is still considered under federal jurisdiction, recently, changes have been made, such as the allowing of direct elections of the Chief or "mayor" of the District.
Original town hall.
The first local authority in New Spain was the ayuntamiento (district council) of Villa Rica in Veracruz, established where Hernán Cortés came ashore in the early 16th century. This governing council was moved to Coyoacán, near Mexico City after the fall of the Aztec city Tenochtitlan. The ayuntamiento was moved here after the first town hall was built between 1526 and 1532, with the first recorded council meeting here in 1526. It was built as a fortress against the Indians, who were forbidden to settle in the area. It had a large meeting room, a scrivener's room to keep records, another for accounting, and audience hall, a chapel and a sacristy. This building also housed a government-controlled butchers and granary Since then, the governing body and building have gone by several names including the "Casas Consistoriales", the "Casas de Cabildos", the "Palacio de Diputación", the "Sala de Cabildos" and the "Consejo Consultivo de la Ciudad." The building was expanded in 1582.
In 1582, a jail was added, the first such in New Spain. Other functions were added to the building such as a coin-making facility, a foundry and residences. This building was destroyed, along with the National Palace in the famine uprising in 1692 . As the building burned, its archives were saved by Carlos de Sigüenza who, with the help of friends and paid servants threw them out of the windows as the building burned, saving records going back to 1524 In 1714, viceroy Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares ordered the building reconstructed. Work began in 1720 under viceroy Baltasar de Zúñiga, 1st Duke of Arión, who managed to have the portals built. The rest of the building was completed in 1724 under viceroy Juan de Acuña, marqués de Casafuerte. The official corn and meat markets located here were abolished and the free market was allowed to take control of these commodities. This resulted in a bustling market in what was the Alley of the Diputación, now 20 de Noviembre. However, these stalls disappeared by 1888. 
In 1910, the building was remodeled for the upcoming centennial of Independence by architect Manuel Gorozope and engineer Guillermo Beltrán. The remodeled building was inaugurated on 16 September (independence day) 1910. However, remodeling work went on from 1912 to 1930 with the addition of the main staircase, the library and the archives, even though work was periodically halted because of the Mexican Revolution. In 1921, another floor was added as well as square towers on the corners on both sides of the main facade. This front facade has talavera tile murals with the coats of arms of Coyoacán, where the ayuntamiento was before here, of the founding of Mexico City, of Christopher Columbus, of Hernan Cortes, of Mexico City as authorized by Charles V and of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz. In some places, some of the foundations of the original building can still be seen. In 1948, the district council was moved from here to the new building built next door, but was moved back here in 1997.
The exterior of the building is topped by two square corner towers each containing three small arches, whose balustrade s appear to spill over the pediments and the eagles that overlook the Zocalo.
The interior has large powerful arches, with richly-decorated moulding at the main entrance. These lead to a double arcade covering a monumental staircase created by architect Alvaro Aburto. On each side of the stairwell are two patios surrounded by arches and columns. The left patio is done in Venetian-style mosaics with images fruits and vegetables as well as large pitchers. The right side patio is home to the Salon de Cabildos, which was recently restored and open for public viewing. This was the place where the city council traditionally convened to settle local disputes. The entry hall to the Salon contains a gallery of portraits of all 62 Spanish viceroys.
New building.
This building is next to the National Palace and the Supreme Court building. After demolition of the old colonial-period Portal de las Flores in 1935, the current structure was built between 1941 and 1948 and designed to fit in with the rest of the architecture of the Zocalo, as well as to be symmetrical with the "old" Palace of the Ayuntamiento next door. The Portal de las Flores (Portal of the Flowers), named so either because its original owner's name was Flores, but since later it housed markets selling fresh flowers, vegetables and fruit from outlying areas, it is commonly held as the origin of the name This Portal was rebuilt in 1724 and remained the site of markets and stores until the 19th century. The 18th century building was demolished in 1935, helping to open up 20 de Noviembre Street and clearing way for the current building.
The outside of the building has relatively sober decoration with windows framed in white stone, parapets with windows and square columns. The "mini-balconies" of the windows are done in wrought iron and the corners of the third floor have estipite columns.
The interior of the vestibule is simple dominated by the main stairwell. This stairwell contains two large murals depicted the history of Mexico from the pre-Hispanic period to just past the Revolution. Both were painted by Carlos Montuy in 1986 .
When the current edifice was being built, they found the remains of the house of Doña Marina or La Malinche and that of the wife of treasurer Alonso de Estrada. Further down, they found a "tlachtli" or Aztec ball game field, a chacmool and other archeological finds.
Government offices.
A number of Federal District department or secretariats are housed in the two buildings. In the original building are housed the "Jefetura de Gobierno" (offices of the Chief of the District), the Secretaría de Gobierno (Secretariat of the Government), and the "Secretaría de Medio Ambiente" (Secretariat of the Environment). In the newer building are housed the "Oficialia Mayor" (Government Oversight), the Secretaría de Desarrollo Social (Secretariat of Social Development), the "Secretaría de Obras y Servicios" (Secretariat of Works and Services) and the "Secretaría de Protección Civil" (Secretariat of Civil Protection).
Politics and culture.
The current Chief of the Federal District is Marcelo Luis Ebrard Casauban.
While the Old Town Hall is overshadowed by the National Palace and Mexico City Cathedral, it has been the scene of some political and social events. In December 2007, microbus operators protested there for a number of days until District Chief Marcelo Ebrard promised to meet with them about their demands for higher tariffs. In the same year, the city sponsored a light show projected onto the side of the building, representing different eras in Mexico City's history. It was called "Mexico DF: una historia en luz" (Mexico, Federal District: a history in light). The show included images and music. President of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero visited the old Palace in 2007 as well, praising Mexico City as the vanguard of social change for the country as he was given the keys to the city.

Zola Maseko

Zola Maseko (born 1967) is a Swazi film director and screenwriter. He is noted for his documentary films related to xenophobia.
Biography.
Maseko was born in exile in 1967. Educated in Swaziland and Tanzania, he joined Umkhonto We Sizwe, the armed sector of the African National Congress, in 1987. After moving to the United Kingdom, he graduated from the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield in 1994. Maseko's first film was the documentary "Dear Sunshine", released in 1992. He fought apartheid in several countries.
He moved to South Africa in 1994 and wrote "The Foreigner", a short fiction film about xenophobia in this country. In 1996, after Maseko drove to his house, an unknown assailant pointed a gun at the director and fired twice. He fled after the gun did not fire. A few minutes later, he called his house, and the assailant was on the phone. He "thought was a foreigner. We are a vigilante group going around killing foreigners. We don't want them here."
In 1998 he directed "The Life and Times of Sarah Baartman", a 53 minute documentary film about a woman named Sarah Baartman in colonial times. Set between 1810 and 1815, the documentary relates the true story of a 20 year-old woman travelling to London from Cape Town and addresses the taboo themes of racial inferiority and black female sexuality. The woman is taken to France in 1814 and from then on became a subject of scientific investigation. Maseko's cinematic techniques were employed to depict the woman as a sub-human species, emphasising the racial prejudice against black Africans in Europe during imperialist times. After her death, her sexual organs and brain were displayed in the Musee de l'Homme in Paris until as recently as 1985. Critically acclaimed, it garnered many awards including Best African Documentary, 1999 at the Pan-African Film Festival (FESPACO), Best Documentary at the 1999 Milan African Film Festival and an award at the 2001 African Literature Association Conference Film Festival.
Other short films by Maseko include "The Return of Sarah Baartman", "Children of the Revolution", and "A Drink in the Passage", all released in 2002. The latter won the Special Jury Award at FESPACO.
His first feature film was "Drum", released in 2004. Set in 1950s Johannesburg, it tells of the magazine of the same name and specifically focuses on Henry Nxumalo, a journalist fighting apartheid. He received the top prize at FESPACO, the Golden Stallion of Yennenga, in addition to a cash prize of 10 million CFA francs (US$20,000) at its closing ceremony in 2005, the first South African to do such.
The filmmaker is currently working on the television series, Homecoming, following the adventures of three freedom fighters trying to fit in with the rest of South Africa. Maseko is also working on "Liverpool Leopard", which is to be his second feature film.

Hong was South Korea's goalkeeper at the 1948. Six years later, he was in goal as South Korea appeared at their first World Cup, in Switzerland. The experience was not a happy one for the Koreans, who lost their two matches 9-0 to Hungary's famous "Magic Magyars" and 7-0 to Turkey.

The scriptwriter wanted to show something of the dangers police officers sometimes faced in their work, but thought it might upset the viewers if one of the characters was killed, so he wrote an episode where the police dog was shot and killed by a gunman. Some viewers were upset by this episode, and shortly after Inky appeared on the children's programme "Blue Peter" to assure children who had seen the programme that he was all right.
Inky's replacement on the programme was Radar.

Church of Saints Peter and Paul, Veliko Tarnovo

The Church of Saints Peter and Paul (, "tsarkva "Sv. sv. Petar i Pavel") is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church in the city of Veliko Tarnovo in central northern Bulgaria, the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The 13th-century church lies at the foot of the Tsarevets hill's northern slopes and was reconstructed in 1981.
The church is dedicated to the Christian Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul. It follows the cross-domed design and has a single apse. The cella is divided into three naves by two rows of columns. The columns' capitals are decorated with plastic carving and tracery. The church has a high, massive iconostasis. According to the 14th-century account of Patriarch Evtimiy, the church and the surrounding monastery were built on the order of Tsar Ivan Asen II's (ruled 1218–1241) wife Anna.
After the Fall of Tarnovo to the Ottomans in 1393, the church may have become the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate for a brief period. It continued to be a metropolitan bishop's residence of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople during the Ottoman rule. The bishop Hilarion of Crete was buried there and his tombstone has been preserved.
Three layers of frescoes inside the church have been preserved to this day. The earliest layer consists of three images of the martyrs of Edessa in the western arch dating to the mid-13th century. The second layer is the images in the narthex; it is stylistically influenced by the Italo-Cretan school from the time of the Council of Florence in the 1430s. The local bishop Ignatius took part in the council and may have propagated the idea of ecumenism. The inscriptions of the second layer are in Bulgarian and Greek. The latest layer of frescoes is that of the images in the southern gallery from the 16th century.

Clown Princes

Clown Princes is a 1939 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by George Sidney. Produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was the 178th "Our Gang" short to be released.
Plot.
When the gang goes to Porky's house, they learn that his family is in danger of eviction unless they pay their landlord the balance remaining on their rent. The gang decides to raise the money by setting up a circus in Porky's barn, with Spanky as the ringleader. A sideshow outside introduces the kid circus' young patrons to Oogie-Boogie, the Wildman from Borneo (Buckwheat), Mademoiselle Darla, the Greatest Rattlesnake Charmer in the World, and the World's Shortest and Tallest Men (Slapsie in a beard and Sniffles on stilts). Also included in the sideshow are the Head Without a Body (Porky), and The Famous Sime and Neez Twins - two boys with their clothes stitched together, revealed as such when Violet the Goat eats the grass skirt covering the stitching.
Inside the main show, the gang's circus show includes a clown act, Spanky and Leonard as "a couple of swell acrobats", and lady lion-tamer Darla. When Darla's "lions" break away and everyone scrambles to catch them, Spanky runs into the landlord, to whom he pays the rest of Porky's rent.
The circus show's marquee attraction is "Daredevil Alfalfa" singing "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze", with Alfalfa's trapeze being held aloft by a pulley system attached to a horse. When a bee turns up and spooks the horse, Alfalfa finds himself pulled and jerked through the air before finally crashing through the ceiling of the barn.

Franklin Martins

Franklin de Sousa Martins (Vitória, August 10, 1948) is a Brazilian journalist, served as Press Secretary for the government of president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil.
He started working as a journalist at 15, as an intern in the pro-Vargas newspaper "Última Hora".
At 20, as a student of Economical Sciences at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (then "University of Guanabara"), Franklin was elected chairman of the Student's Executive (DCE) and, soon after, vice-chairman of the Metropolitan Union of Students, in Rio de Janeiro. By then, Martins approached then fellow student leader José Dirceu, who was to become a founding member of the Workers Party and a grey eminence behind Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
As a youth, Martins was not only a student leader but after the 1964 coup d'état in Brazil, engaged in armed struggle and urban guerrilla. In the communist group MR-8, he was known as "Valdir" (codename). During the military dictatorship, he had a prominent role within the movements which fought against the regime. The acts included bank robbery (then called "revolutionary expropriation" by the guerrilla rhethorics) and assaults on police and military. The amount was used to buy weapons and bribe authorities to release fellow militants. Franklin Martins was held in prison between October and December 1968, being released on the eve of Institutional Act#5, which dissolved the Congress, and institutionalized censorship and torture in Brazil.
In September 1969, he joined and led the joint group of the MR-8 and the National Action for Liberation (ALN) which kidnapped the US ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick. The act was carried to force the junta to set free 15 political prisoners. For taking part in the kidnapping, Franklin Martins is still denied entrance in the United States, even in an official state position (along as Fernando Gabeira, who was also involved).
Martins lived in Cuba, Chile and France, where he graduated at the École de Sciences Sociales of the University of Paris. While in Cuba, in the Pinar del Río province, he attended guerrilla lessons, learning to operate weapons, explosives and military tactics.
After the general amnesty proclaimed in Brazil in 1979, Franklin Martins returned home and resumed work as a journalist. Ironically, he eventually went to work at the Globo TV network, one of the main supporters of the military regime. In 1996, he became political commentator of the broadcast news, "Jornal Nacional" and "Jornal da Globo". In May 2006, he was suddenly dismissed by the news director, Ali Kamel. 
After a brief stay at rival Bandeirantes network, Martins was called by president Lula to head the Department of Social Communication, a ministry-rank post equivalent to Press Secretary. One of his main projects developed in this position was the creation of TV Brasil, the first public TV network in the nation (although formally state-owned).

Matthew Brown (college president)

Matthew Brown was a prominent Presbyterian minister and president of Washington College and Jefferson College. Next to John McMillan, Brown was the most important figure to education in Western Pennsylvania.
Brown was born in January 1776 in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania (now part of Union County, Pennsylvania. His paternal grandfather, a native of Ireland even though he was of Scottish descent, emigrated to America in 1720 and settled in eastern Pennsylvania. His father, also named Matthew Brown, was born in 1732 and was an early settler of White Deer Valley and a soldier in the American Revolutionary War. Upon his father's death, young Matthew Brown and his brother were adopted by their father's brother, William Brown, a religious man who was a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature.
Brown graduated from Dickinson College in 1794 and taught in a classical school in Northumberland County. In 1796, he began to study theology and was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Carlisle on October 3, 1799. He held a call in Mifflin, Pennsylvania and Lost Creek within the Presbytery of Huntingdon. 
On October 15, 1805 he was installed as preacher of the First Presbyterian Church of Washington, Pennsylvania. He was also elected principal of Washington Academy and was a principal agent in securing its charter to become Washington College; he was elected its first president on December 13, 1806, serving that position in tandem with his pastoral duties. The reputation of the college and the prosperity of the church grew considerably under his leadership. During this time, the town of Washington had grown from a small pioneer settlement into a larger town, and he vigorously denounced the growing practices of card playing and dances in his famous "Serpent Sermon." In 1817, and agreement was made between the church and Washington College that no one should supervise both institutions. Brown chose the church and resigned the presidency on April 30, 1817. He turned down offers of the presidency of Centre College and his alma mater Dickinson College to remain as pastor in Washington. He resigned that position in 1822 to accept the presidency of Jefferson College at Canonsburg.
On September 25, 1822, Brown was elected the fifth president of Jefferson College, largely due to the support and influence of Rev. Dr. Samuel Ralston, who was president of the Board of Trustees of Jefferson College. He was paid an annual salary of $800. In 1824, Jefferson College established the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. The college erected Providence Hall between 1829 and 1832. Jefferson College graduated 770 students during his tenure. He resigned at the age of 69 in 1845 due to ill health. He died on July 29, 1853.

Joseph Paul Johannes Hoch (May 3, 1815 – September 19, 1874) was a German lawyer and benefactor. He willed his fortune to the Hoch Conservatory Foundation, founded in 1878 in Frankfurt. It is, after Leipzig and Berlin, the seventh oldest music conservatory in Germany. He was born and died in Frankfurt am Main.
Life.
Hoch came from a family which had been in Frankfurt am Main for generations. All four of his grandparents had lived there. His father, the lawyer Johann Peter Hieronymus Hoch (1779 – 1831), was a magistrate and senator who, in 1829, became mayor of the Free City of Frankfurt. His mother, the Swiss-born Ottilie von Sodenstern, was also the child of a magistrate and senator.
He began to learn piano and violin at a young age. Like his father before him, Hoch studied law and received the degree of Doctor of Law. At the age of 41 he married the Baroness Ottilie von Sodenstern, who would outlive him by 48 years. She died in Kassel in 1922. The couple had no offspring. 
He inherited a large fortune from both sides of his family. He decided early on, with banker Johann Friedrich Städel as his model, to bequeath enough money to his city to found an institute for education in the arts. Before he made a trip to in England in 1843, he made a first version of a will with this intention, which was completed on July 14, 1857. In his testament of 21 paragraphs, he left the Conservatory Foundation approximately one million German gold marks.
His grave can be found at the main city graveyard in Frankfurt.

Wyckoff mansion in Cornell Heights, the old Ithaca High School building (now Dewitt Mall), Cascadilla School, the Stewart Street School, the Savings Bank, the Congregational, Baptist and Unitarian churches, and many other public and private buildings.
Among his non-Ithaca buildings were the main building of Wells College in Aurora, New York, the Toutorsky Mansion in Washington, D.C., a villa on Carleton Island for Wyckoff's father, the typewriter magnate William O. Wyckoff, and Iviswold (1889) for David Brinkerfhoff Ivison, designed as an expansion of the Floyd W. Tomkins House in Rutherford, N.J. Iviswold is now part of the Rutherford campus of Felician College. Miller also designed two mansions on Rochester, New York's East Avenue (The Avenue of the Presidents) at 800 for Dr. John W. Whitbeck in 1887 and at 963 for Francis A. Macomber in 1888.

Edgar Linton

Edgar Linton is a fictional character in Emily Brontë's novel "Wuthering Heights". His role in the story is that of Catherine Earnshaw's husband. He resides at Thrushcross Grange and falls prey to Heathcliff's schemes for revenge against his family.
Edgar is the father of his and Catherine's daughter, Catherine Linton, and the brother of Isabella Linton. He is a foil of Heathcliff as a character, as shown by his tender, gentle, and weak personality as opposed to Heathcliff's savage, tyrannical nature.
Description.
Edgar Linton is regarded as the complete opposite of his wife, Catherine Earnshaw, and her foster brother and true love, Heathcliff. With his fair long hair, his pale skin and his blue eyes, Edgar seems to have stumbled out of a Jane Austen novel for the quiet, gentle life he at first leads at Thrushcross Grange, a home of peace and goodwill until Heathcliff's presence fills it. Edgar is said to be constitutionally weak, as is the case throughout the Linton family, and is very distressed when he realizes that he cannot match the fire and passion of his wayward wife and her soul mate. He loves Catherine dearly, despite her passion for Heathcliff, and adores their daughter, named after his wife. When Isabella, his sister, marries Heathcliff, he insists that he will no longer have a relationship with her, and that they are brother and sister only in name. His portrait, perfectly and accurately resembling him, is thus described:
Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face, exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost too graceful.

From the Abyss

Gameplay.
In "From the Abyss", players control an adventurer in the land of Rubenhaut. Rubenhaut was a peace loving country, ruled by queens until a dimensional gate the queens had used to seal away evil was broken. Rubenhaut's armies were incapable of fighting off the evil demons and now it is up to the player to seal them away once more.
"From the Abyss" sends players into randomized dungeons to fight monsters and collect items. Dungeons may be of a variety of themes such as fire and ice. A map is automatically drawn for the player as they progress through each dungeon, which itself is laid out on a grid. Single player and co-op modes are available but co-op does not allow the player to progress the story.
Reception.
Official reviews for "From the Abyss" have been critical of the gameplay. Criticisms include "monotonous dungeons" and a "simplistic plot". The average score on Metacritic is 59%, pooling reviews from 9 separate online sources.

Diogo, Duke of Viseu

Infante Diogo of Viseu (1450–1484) was the second son of Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu, and his wife Beatriz of Portugal.
In 1472, when his older brother John, Duke of Viseu, died without issue, Diogo inherited his titles and estates as Duke of Viseu and Duke of Beja.
Diogo was a popular personality at the court of his cousin King John II, and together with Duke Fernando II of Braganza, he was the main target of King John’s centralization policies. John II sought to limit the power of the upper nobility, which had increased greatly during the reign of John's father Afonso V of Portugal.
Duke Fernando II of Braganza, husband of Isabella of Viseu, the sister-in-law of King John II of Portugal and Diogo's sister, was the first victim of John's efforts against the Portuguese nobility. He was imprisoned, tried and executed in Évora. Once his sister Eleanor of Viseu was married to the king, Diogo thought he was protected from the king’s anger.
On two occasions, the king’s life was in danger and as Diogo of Viseu remained the leader of the upper nobility against the King’s policies, John II accused him of high treason and personally killed him.
After the execution, King John II called the duke’s younger brother, Infante Manuel of Viseu, and showed him his brother’s body. He promised Manuel that he would consider his own son. At that moment, Manuel inherited his brother Diogo's titles and estates.
Duke Diogo never married, but when he was quite young he visited the Crown of Castile, where he had a love affair with "Doña" Leonor de Sotomaior y Portugal (great-granddaughter of King Pedro I of Portugal). With her he had a natural son, Afonso de Portugal. King Manuel I of Portugal granted this nephew, Afonso de Portugal, the position of 8th Constable of Portugal. Afonso’s daughter and heir, Beatrice of Lara, married the 3rd Marquis of Vila Real.

Interact - part of the Stagecoach Charitable Trust - offers free weekly workshops to disadvantaged children.
Stagecoach Theatre Arts is the leading Franchise for part-time theatre arts schools in Australia, Canada, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Malta, Spain, the United Kingdom and the USA.
Overview.
Stagecoach Theatre Arts Ltd is a national network of part-time theatre schools for young people aged 4 to 18 years. It was founded by Stephanie Manuel and David Sprigg in 1988 in Surrey and is now the longest running and most successful children’s performing arts schools network in the world. Stagecoach caters for the needs of young performers - whether they are budding talents or reserved and shy. Stagecoach has provided a springboard for some of the UK's leading young talent and had the privilege of watching thousands of children grow in confidence and ability. Stagecoach are committed to helping children develop in all these areas of the performing arts while at the same time introducing them to a range of musical genres and skills in a friendly, safe and fun environment. Often copied, but never equaled, Stagecoach has remained the market leader for children's performing arts, reaching beyond the scope of normal after-school clubs.
Although Stagecoach is open to all young people with an interest in the performing arts whatever their ability, it does provide opportunities to perform professionally and some students have found considerable success in film, television and on the West End stage.
Occasionally Stagecoach schools come together for large national events. These have included performances at The Royal Albert Hall, the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations, The Lord Mayor's Show and Her Majesty's and Drury Lane Theatres in London's West End.
25th Anniversary Celebrations.
To celebrate Stagecoaches 25th Anniversary, 3500 children will perform Andrew Lloyd Webbers 'Cats The Musical'in the Birmingham National Indoor Arena on March 24, 2013. In association with 'The Really Useful Group', 3500 children from across Europe will join a virtual choir of many international Stagecoach students to perform the biggest production of the musical ever seen. The virtual choir is an addition to a 500 strong live choir, and to accompany the choir and the rest of the students is a full size orchestra and 16 selected soloists. 35 Stagecoach franchises across the UK will perform the show on 7 'stages' around the arena, with each school taking it in turns to portray a small section of the musical. In addition to this, 52 selected elite dancers, including 14 solo dancers taking the named parts, will perform the whole musical on a raised stage in the centre of the arena. The Really Useful Group, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Veronica Bennets, Stephanie Manuel and Paul Leddington Wright all contributed and collaborated to bring this production together.
New Stagecoach logos and special 25th anniversary logos were also released as part of the celebrations. Many celebrities involved either with Stagecoach or with general theatre and musicals have wished Stagecoach luck in the performance of Cats, including Ruthie Henshall, Tom Fletcher and Dani Harmer.
Early Stages (4 to 6 years old).
Children aged 4–6 years are introduced to Stagecoach through Early Stages classes which run for a shorter period of 90 minutes, split into three 30 minute sessions in dance, drama and singing. Class sizes are small (15 maximum) with room to nurture young raw talent alongside encouraging and inspiring those whose confidence needs building.
Running for 90 minutes, the Early Stages class is split up into three 30 minute sessions, where young children learn performing arts skills through singing, dancing and drama classes:
Singing classes.
Children identify where their voices come from and how sounds are made and formed. Young kids get the opportunity to develop rhythm and timing, improving diction, alongside learning popular show songs.
Dance classes.
Working in a group, children learn fun and contemporary routines, which help improve coordination, balance and spatial awareness, while developing strong motor skills.
Drama classes.
Through role play and improvisation young children get to stretch their imagination, experimenting with words and feelings. By interacting with others in the group they learn vital social skills such as giving, taking and sharing. In themed fantasy worlds and through storytelling kids can express themselves physically and emotionally, learning new words and phrases while memorising lines through repetition.
Parents receive individually written reports on their child's progress twice a year.
Main School (6 to 18 years old).
Stagecoach offer singing, drama and dancing lessons all in one place over a three hour time slot. The schools operate for three hours each week during term-time, either after school or at weekends where kids learn to sing, dance and act. Split into three groups of similar ages, youngsters gain confidence, self-esteem and learn to express themselves creatively and effectively through drama classes, singing lessons and dance classes. These skills, acquired while learning the skills of performance, do not disappear when they come off stage, they are skills for life.
Young Performer.
Young Performer (Known as 'The Mask' until a revamp to Young Performer in approx 2000) is the only national performing arts magazine for young people. Inspired by Stagecoach and published by Ten Alps Creative, the magazine is designed to appeal to those young people for whom acting, singing and dancing is a passion. With six issues a year, the focus is to entertain, inform and educate through articles, interviews, news stories, quizzes and competitions.
Young Performer magazine is circulated to all members of Stagecoach, a magazine devoted to young actors, singers and dancers, and includes information on the entertainment industry, and interviews with young British actors.
Stagecoach at Her Majesty's.
Three times each year Stagecoach schools can take part in a special performance at Her Majesty's theatre in Central London - providing an exciting opportunity for students to perform on a West End stage.
Her Majesty's theatre - famous as the home of 'The Phantom of the Opera' - plays host to a collection of Stagecoach schools from around the UK and overseas. Stagecoach students busily rehearse for their evening in the spotlight, and on a Sunday they arrive at the theatre during the day to prepare for the evening performance, some of them travelling many miles to be there.
Stagecoach Regional Choirs.
The first Stagecoach Choir was established in 2000 in the Midlands, and was created out of a separate choir, auditioned and put together for a show especially commissioned for performance in the Millennium Dome. Written by Veronica Bennetts this piece, "The Piper's People", comprised a dance troupe, a choir and several soloists and fused Bennetts' beautiful music with traditional Commedia dell'Arte characters. The following year, the newly created 'Midlands Choir' was invited, along with the original soloists, to recreate this performance, along with another new piece by Bennetts entitled "The Ragman", in Coventry Cathedral. The Midlands Choir, along with its southern counterpart the Stagecoach Singing Ensemble, a smaller close-harmony group auditioned from Surrey and the surrounding area and based in Stagecoach's Head Office in Walton-on-Thames, were so successful that the decision was subsequently taken to create 'Regional Choirs' to cover most of the UK.
Since then nine more choirs have been established, all composed of Stagecoach students and run by Stagecoach Principals or other members of staff, celebrating the best ensemble singing in the Stagecoach network. The Stagecoach Singing Ensemble was then enlarged to a similar size to the other regional choirs and renamed the London Choir initially, and subsequently the Surrey Choir.
Since their inception, the Midlands Choir and the Stagecoach Singing Ensemble have performed in many venues around the country, including the Stagecoach at Her Majesty's and at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane events, at the Royal Albert Hall (both), as a solo group for the Queen's Golden Jubilee in the Mall (Singing Ensemble) and the regional choirs have since continued this tradition. As well as participating in many events across the country, the regional Choirs have performed together on three occasions as part of the Stagecoach National Choir Festival. The first Choir Festival took place at the Birmingham Symphony Hall in 2006. After the resounding success of this event, further Choir Festivals have been held every two years.
Teacher Training.
The Stagecoach Teacher Training Course is a course for those who wish to learn more about the teaching of performing arts; established teachers who are wishing to revitalise their skills in the teaching of performing arts; or for those who wish to teach more creatively.
The ADPA has been developed for teachers working with young people in part-time performing arts and those teaching children skills for singing, dancing or drama. It is an internationally recognised qualification awarded by Performance Arts Awards. The preparation course is delivered by Stagecoach Theatre Arts.
The Stagecoach Teacher Training short course looks at classroom management, preparation of lessons, realistic lesson plan writing, child development, diversity awareness, current child protection issues, health and safety issues and much more.
Localization.
Stagecoach is available with localized website versions in 10 countries including the UK.
RADA Collaboration.
In early 2011, Stagecoach Theatre Arts teamed up with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) and designed the 3Dimensions course.
This part-time course is specificially constructed to offer students aged 16–19 years the opportunity to train in the performing arts to a high standard of drama, dance and singing, while continuing with school studies or employment. The innovative part-time course allows students to still consider their future options; be it vocational training in the performing arts, university or even a career away from the arts.
Taking place over four academic terms, the course consists of three-hour classes each weekend during term time. An additional four intensive one-week workshops will be taken during the holidays at RADA in central London. Sessions will include acting classes, musical theatre training, singing lessons, auditioning for drama school, teacher training, Shakespeare and auditioning for musical theatre.
Entry is by audition only and students work under the guidance of specialist tutors at the top of their fields to enrich their skills. The first cohort started in September 2011 and is based at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in central London.
Child Licensing Petition.
On 13 May 2008 Stagecoach, along with 60 students and parents, went to Downing Street to present Gordon Brown with over 10,000 signatures. The petition called Gordon Brown for an immediate reform and overhaul of legislation relating to the Children's performance licence to ensure that children throughout the country are given equal opportunities in a safe and protected environment. Stagecoach publicly announced that they are currently waiting for a response from the government and will, furthermore, publish details as soon as they are received.
Background.
Tarquin Shaw-Young the Managing Director of the Agency & Head of Casting who led this campaign says that from its own research and experience Stagecoach and its Agency believes that the current legislation is seriously flawed and that some local authorities are failing in their statutory duties to ensure adequate protection for minors working in the entertainment sector. Stagecoach believes that misunderstanding of the current legislation, results in differing standards across the country and a paperwork burden on local authorities preventing them from providing the protection that the current legislation intends.
Stagecoach calls on Government to amend existing legislation, or to implement new legislation in order to ensure that children throughout the country are given equal opportunities in a safe and protected environment. The undersigned agree and support Stagecoach in its call to Government to reform Children’s Performance Licences.
Easy Stages.
When a Stagecoach Student has attended for more than 3 years and are aged over 8, they are automatically offered the opportunity to audition to perform in "Easy Stages", an annual production where students from across the UK and the rest of the world rehearse for 3 weeks on the outskirts of London and perform a musical to a professional standard. Performances currently take place at The Leatherhead Theatre (Previous venues include the Waterman Theatre and Epsom Playhouse).
Past shows have included:
1998: Guys and Dolls
1999: Sing Your Story
2000: Fiddler On The Roof
2001: Jane Eyre
2002: Barnum
2003: Seven Brides for Seven Brothers
2004: The Pirates of Penzance
2005: Gypsy Blood (based on Wuthering Heights)
2006: Annie
2007: Oliver
2008: Children of Eden
2009: Unsinkable (based on Titanic)
2010: My Fair Lady
2011: Secret Garden
2012: Calamity Jane
2013: West Side Story
Stagecoach Agency UK & Ireland.
The Stagecoach Agency UK & Ireland is the Europe's largest children’s performers’ agency and represents students, between 4 – 20 years, currently attending the Stagecoach Theatre Arts network of schools across the UK and wishing to be represented by an agent.
The Agency offers Stagecoach students, who choose to become members of the Agency, opportunities to take part in exciting and worthwhile experiences from a wide range of entertainment platforms.
All members represented by the Agency are included each year in Stagecoach's Spotlight directory, the industry's 'casting bible'. In addition all members' CVs are displayed on the leading internet based casting website service 'Spotlight Interactive', which is only viewable by casting directors, not the general public.
Whenever casting professionals require children for their productions happening anywhere in the UK they call.
The Stagecoach Agency enjoy a high degree of success within the industry and in their 2010, managing director & head of casting Tarquin Shaw-Young reported that in the directory year they enrolled over 2100 students and won over 5,500 auditions or bookings for their members. Successes have included winning parts, both major and supporting, in TV, Films, Commercials, Radio, Voice-overs, west End Shows, Corporates and Photoshoots.

Carbolic soap

Carbolic soap is a mild disinfectant soap containing carbolic acid (phenol). Once widely available in the United States and the most common disinfectant cleaner in hospitals, it has disappeared from all but specialty retail stores. It is distributed to disaster victims for routine hygiene by the Red Cross and other relief organizations. Remembered by many older Americans as the household soap of their childhood, such as the brand Lifebuoy, it is sought after by some for its nostalgic sweet, tarry smell. By killing bacteria, it acts as a mild deodorant when used as a body soap.
In England it was used in state schools at least up until the 1970s; in Scottish state schools its use continued at least until the late 1980s. The smell is evocative for generations of children. Quite often it would irritate the skin.
In the 1960s teachers in England were allowed to use corporal punishment in the classroom, so along with the cane, a child who swore in class might be made to wash their mouth out with carbolic soap.
Carbolic soap is still used regularly in the Caribbean region, especially Jamaica where it can be found in most drugstores or supermarkets.

<doc id="19688599" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19688599" title="Offset agreement">
Offset agreement

Defense offset agreements are legal trade practices in the aerospace and military industries. These commercial practices do not need state regulations but, since the purchasers are mostly military departments of sovereign nations comparable to the US Defense Department, many countries have offset laws, public regulations or, alternatively, formal internal offset policies. The international names for these commercial practices connected to weapons trade are various: industrial compensations, industrial cooperation, offsets, industrial and regional benefits, balances, "juste retour" or equilibrium, to define mechanisms more complex than counter-trade. Offset agreements are protectionist, and distort competition.
Counter-trade can also be considered one of the many forms of defense offset, to compensate a purchasing country. The main difference between a generic offset and counter-trade, both common practices in the international defense trade, is the involvement of money. In counter-trade, goods are paid through barters or other mechanisms without the exchange of money, while in other defense offsets money is the measure and the medium of exchange.
Definition.
An offset agreement is an agreement between two parties whereby a supplier agrees to buy products from the party to whom it is selling, in order to win the buyer as a customer and offset the buyer's outlay. Generally the seller is a foreign company and the buyer is a government that stipulates that the seller must then agree to buy products from companies within their country. Often, the aim of this process is to even-up a country's balance of trade. This is frequently an integral part of international defense contracts.
Offset as unfair burden.
The U.S. government's definition of offset agreement is the most crucial, since the U.S. aerospace and defense industry is exporting the majority of the world’s weapons, and therefore engaged in the majority of the world’s offsets. The U.S. has a Commerce Department Division, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), that deals specifically with U.S. defense offset agreements with foreign nations as a main subset of U.S. industrial security. BIS - whose main task is protecting U.S. security from the point of view of export of high technology, fostering commercially acceptable U.S. foreign policy, and protecting U.S. economic interests - deals with U.S. aerospace and defense companies that export defense products, systems or services, involving “offset agreements,” that is, those sales' collateral or additional agreements requested by purchasers. BIS defines offsets as “mandatory compensations required by foreign governments when purchasing weapon systems and services.”
The U.S. government underlines the compulsory aspect of this trade practice, since the United States, with other weapons exporting countries, such as Germany and France, opposes offsets as forms of protectionism and harmful transgressions of free market rules. These governments frown on offset agreements, consider them to be both market distorting and inefficient.
Offset as partnership.
In 2008 the Brazilian Minister of Strategic Affairs, speaking of a major defense purchase by his country, highlighted this key point: “We will not simply be buyers or clients, but partners.” The competition by different companies “in offering comparable weapons to a country" is also on the level of “sharing” or “partnership” with the purchaser, Roberto Mangabeira Unger added.
Offset as marketing tool.
In weapons trade, defense contractors are fully aware that offsets are powerful marketing tools to motivate the purchase, by showing and giving additional advantages for the purchasing country besides investing in military equipment. The U.S. defense industry position seems to be more practical, and somewhat quietly nonaligned with U.S. government economic or political assessment of defense offsets. Generally speaking, one can understand offsets as a widespread sales technique. As such, they are not restricted to weapons sale, they belong to commerce itself, in the same way that rebates, price-pack deals, or loyalty rewards programs do. Understanding “defense offsets” to be part of a sales technique helps to curb the justified yet excessive emphasis on their mandatory nature.
Often, defense offsets are more motivating than the primary defense acquisition, for personal or political reasons. This may seem irrational, but it is part of commerce. If one adds the prevalent political aspect of spending huge public funds on modern weapons, then the motivating significance of defense offsets could not be underestimated in contemporary decision processes of democracies. Prime defense contractors are well aware of offsets' power in the psychologies of democracies. As anyone can understand, the seller will include the cost of the “Envelope B,” that is, of the offset and its added value for the purchaser, in its total cost. In other words, the client will pay for the offset; it is not a free lunch. But the key question is: to what extent is the offset proposal a factor in the consideration of defense contractor’s tender during the evaluation and the decision procedures? 
Transparency International clearly summarizes that using offsets as marketing tools makes offsets "the ideal playground for corruption": 
The universe of this military niche of offsets trade is sophisticated and less innocuous than commonly believed. In 2000 Daniel Pearl wrote an article about the universe of offsets: “could the sale of U.S. weapons in the Persian Gulf help an oil concern unload gasoline stations in Europe? Yes, under the new logic of international arms deals.” Pearl describes the new-found world of indirect offsets: 
Defense offset example.
As an example of a defense offset proposal, we could describe a hypothetical case of Nation "P" (Purchaser) buying 300 tanks from defense company "S" (Seller, of Nation S). The total sale contract is $400 million and Nation "P" (Purchaser) requests offset of 120%. Defense Company "S" (Seller) is obliged to fulfill an offset equal to 120% of the sales contract, that is $480M. Nation "P" agrees on a list of specific offset deals and programs to fulfill the agreed total obligation with Company "S" (Seller). The offset agreement includes both direct and indirect offsets.
Nation "P" also assigns a credit value for each typology of offsets offered by Company "S". The credit value for the offset obligations is not the “actual value,” but it is the “actual value” by a multiplier, that expresses the degree of interest of Nation "P" (Purchaser) in the proposed offsets. In other words, something deemed very valuable by nation "P" will have a high multiplier that expresses the importance and the value to Nation "P" of that type of offset. The multiplier (for instance 2, or 5, or 7) translates nation P's attached value into the credit value that eventually accounts for the fulfillment of the agreed sum of $480 (120% of offset); it is evident that with no multipliers, 120% offset would be nonsense. 
Most of the offset packages are divided into direct and indirect offsets. Here is a hypothetical, complex offset offer, divided into direct and indirect offsets in Nation "P".
Direct Offsets (military and related to the product of the Company "S", i.e. the tanks in this example)
Indirect Offsets (civilian and other agreements not related to the production of the weapons item, the tanks. They could be also military or security related, but not directly connected with the main acquisition, i.e., the tanks)
Nation "P" controls not only the supply of the military systems or services, but also the implementation of the offsets according to the offset agreement included or related to the main supply contract. This control is within the Minister of Defense and/or Ministry of Economy or Finance, or Ministry of Industry and Trade. Often arms importing nations establish special agencies for the supervision of the defense offsets.
Types of offset.
Offset proposals often make a distinction between direct and indirect offset.
Direct offset is a side agreement that has to do with the main product/service that is bought/sold, that is military equipment, systems, or services. They may be also called military offsets. For example, a buyer of military equipment may be given the right to produce a component of a related technology in the buyer's country.
Indirect offsets are side agreements that are not directly related to the product/service that is bought/sold. Most people refer to such category of offsets as civilian offsets, though there are many indirect offsets that are not civilian offsets. Indirect offsets may take the form of services, investments, counter-trade and/or co-production. For instance, Greek companies produce part of the Lockheed C-130 that they bought from U.S. The Greek co-production is a U.S. direct offset. Or, in a more sophisticated form of offset involving three countries, Portugal is in charge of the maintenance of Kuwaiti Lockheed Martin aircraft. This is a Portuguese “direct offset", since Portugal bought the aircraft, and is partner in charge of their maintenance. An investment in a security software company of Romania, or in assisting the export and marketing in difficult areas of a Belgian environmental company are other forms of actual indirect offsets.
The most common types of direct/indirect offsets are:
The most complete and accurate list of actual offsets can be found in the BIS Annual Reports to Congress, where all forms of registered offset are codified, according to the old Standard Industrial Classification.
Some offset mechanisms.
Defense prime contractor, offset service providers.
In medium and large tenders for weapons systems the bid can be very complex, involving one or more than one company as bidder. The main offer is guided by a prime contractor that may have other companies associated to the bid as partners or as subcontractors. However, in regards to the agreed offset proposal only the prime contractor is liable toward the final client for its fulfillment. Since offsets are increasingly complex, the prime contractor may hire subcontractors to fulfill its contractual obligations. While the liability for the offsets stays with the prime contractor, the job can be executed by a subcontractor, or an offset fulfiller.
One of the collateral benefits of offsets in U.S. (probably not offsetting the adverse effects of defense offsets on economy and jobs) is the proliferation of legal and economic jobs in the “offsets sector,” that goes from international legal companies to the fully staffed international offices of U.S. defense companies. In addition, the establishment of new companies in “offset” venture capital, in “offset” marketing assistance: offset fulfillers that provide their support services to the defense and aerospace industry. While many offset programs originally evolved as a result of defense and aerospace sales, today many new offset / Industrial Partnership programs have developed as a result of nations wanting to improve their industrial base, level of technology and desire to become more self-sufficient across a broad range of industry sectors. As a result of this new interest and demand for Industrial Partnership, there has been both a growth and establishment of new offset associations. There are both Global and Domestic "Offset" / Industrial Partnership organizations. The largest and most widely attended global association is "GOCA", the Global Offset and Countertrade Association, whose purpose is to promote trade and commerce between companies around the world and their foreign customers through a greater understanding of countertrade and offset.
Offset fulfillers /service providers may perform various support services: including marketing assistance, sourcing and structuring venture capital or other forms of corporate credit for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), or more complex things, such as a joint ventures to produce shrimp ("Devcorp", Bahrain [http://www.devcorpint.com/]), a sugar factory, or, recently, environment and renewable energy.
Offset certificates, penalties, confidentiality clauses, pre-offset activities.
Offsets are of various durations. They may be planned to last for 1 or 2 years, but 8-10 year plans are very common; exceptionally long is an offset like Al Yamamah Program, a BAE-UK offset in Saudi Arabia in place since 1987. Clients (sovereign countries) have in place mechanisms to control their implementations, and to certificate milestone accomplishments in their offset programs. An offset supervision authority certifies the advancement in the offset completion in percentages, issuing offset certificates. These certificates may be issued to prime contractors fulfilling their offset agreement, but also to offset fulfillers, that have subcontracted the job from prime contractors and registered as such in the foreign countries. When there are multipliers, such certificates express the percentage of completion in "credit value" ("actual value" X multiplier). Offset fulfillers redeems the offsets certificates through contracts or subcontracts with the prime contractor. More recently, given the importance and the growth of offset practices around the world, offset fulfillers can “sell” their certificates to prime contractors other than their initial one, as long as they have national offset commissions authorizations. In this profitable niche of defense industry made by offset specialists, lawyers and companies - there is also a “currency” and a “trade” of offset certificates.
Like in any contract, there are forms of penalty for failing to complete offset obligations. Many nations have rigid systems of penalties, including the use of bank guarantees, while other nations believe in continued negotiations that are based on “the best effort” clauses. The list of incentives and penalties for offset is no different from many other systems of procurement, with two remarkable exceptions:
1. In the offset business there are two contracts proceeding in parallel, i.e. primary (A) and side (B) contract:
2. In direct offsets contracts there are legitimate "clauses of confidentiality", that in several countries may even assume value of official classification, up to secret of state. In European Union States, however, extending state secret classifications to indirect offsets - that have nothing to do with military or state security - is and it is considered an abuse. For instance, classifying an offset not-related to state security or military preparedness - such as indirect and civilian offsets in pharmaceutical research, environmental technologies or export assistance of any non-military/security products - leads not only to major market distortions but also to possibly unpunished corruption protected by baseless secrecy.
Pre-offset activities are allowed and welcomed by several countries; they are like offsets without certainties to obtain “credit value”. These activities are straight marketing activities, similar to lobbying, to promote specific defense purchases. These pre-offset activities must be registered as such with national authorities. Often pre-offset activities will receive certificates, after a sale. Defense companies include them in the marketing budget, but after the sale, these offsets go into their offset budgets, and count toward offset fulfillment. These kinds of pre-offset activities are sales arguments to convince the buying state of the strength and reliability of the aerospace & defense company as potential supplier and partner. The pre-offsets arena is also the delicate and problematic field of sale-facilitators and, precisely because the client is a state, this must be monitored with additional care, since this field is prone to abuse and outright corruption.
Foreign military and direct commercial sales – "no known offsets" and FMF.
For the U.S., the major world exporter of weapons by far, there are two main ways to sell weapons to a foreign country. The first is referred to as "Direct Commercial Sale" and it is a company to government sale. The second way is referred to as "Foreign Military Sales", that is a government to government sale.
A Direct Commercial Sale is highly supervised by U.S. Government and even by the U.S. Congress, in spite of its free market appearance. The arms trade, because of its connection with national security, is never free from strict government supervision.
For a sale to a foreign country's Defense Department, a U.S. defense firm must be licensed. It is checked by the Defense Department and by the State Department, and, in the case of relevant sales, even authorized or vetoed by U.S. Congress. Direct Commercial Sales are highly regulated because of security, political, and commercial reasons. Even from the point of view of indirect and non-military offset agreements, U.S. Defense companies and their subcontractors (offset fulfillers) must present detailed report of their offset activities to the Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).
Foreign Military Sales are indirect sales of weapons produced by one or more U.S. contractors through an agency of the Department of Defense, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). In this type of sale, however, there are two important aspects in regards to the offset business.
1) Since 1990, under a specific directive by President George Bush, 
The "Defense Security Cooperation Agency" acts on behalf of the prime contractor with a foreign government and refuses even the mere knowledge about offsets, but under the FMS program prime contractors are allowed to put all their offset costs into the final price.
The cost of the offset is not even itemized in the FMS offer, and if the client wants to discuss or simply to know the cost of the offset, the client must speak directly with the Contractor and not with DSCA. In other words, U.S. Government cannot deal with offsets; U.S. Defense Prime Contractors can and do. DSCA has made available in its complete manual details and analytical explanations for U.S. Defense companies on how to include the offset various costs into their contract and invoices. So prime contractors, even under FMS, are allowed to recover all costs “of any offsets which are associated with those contracts.” To be sure, “U.S. Government agencies may not enter into or commit U.S. companies to any offset agreement.” 
"De facto" during the cold war offsets had different functions and often U.S. Government Agencies were directly involved. President Bush, by ending the cold war with a victory, likewise ended U.S. agencies’ liability in delicate practices like the offsets (1990), since they lost the primary political value they had during the cold war.
2) U.S. funds assigned by United States Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that may be connected with Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cannot be used for any type of offsets, if they are non-repayable funds. On the other hand, FMF funds may be used for offset costs if they are loans. In any case, "U.S. Government agencies may not enter into or commit U.S. firms to any offset agreement."
List of countries' offset policies.
The following is a cursory survey on some countries' offset policies. It does not enter into details, and basically it gives: 1) the legal base for the offset; 2) the purchase threshold above which there is a requests for offset; 3) the requested “quantity” of offset by the country in terms of percentages of the contract value; 4) the applied multipliers, that qualify (“quality”) through a number the appreciations of a certain type of offsets (the “Credit Value” of an offset is the “Actual Value” by the multiplier); 5) and some remarks or specific information, including the websites of the National Offset activities.
A detailed list of the National Laws and Policies of the Countries of the European Union can be found in the website of European Defense Agency in a new “EU Offset Portal”Another very useful analysis of country policies can be found in Belgian Ministry of Economy (in charge of Belgian offsets). This publicly available document gives one of the most intelligent global analyses of countries offsets policies, with a purchaser's perspective, that is the point of view of weapons importer countries [http://economie.fgov.be/organization_market/compensations/industrial_offset_en.htm. From a similar point of view, one can see the purchaser's point of view on offsets in UAE offset web-page in the new Kuwaiti articulated offset policy [http://www.kuwaitnoc.com.
On the seller's point of view, in Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Annual Reports to U.S. Congress one can find the position on offsets of weapons exporters countries like U.S. Magazines and specialized publications like "Jane's Defense Industry" EPICOS"[http://www.epicos.com, "Countertrade & Offset" or CTO [http://www.cto-offset.com] give detail accounts and updates on national policies, requests, changes, etc.
Criticism of offset agreements.
While widely practiced, some, such as the US government, consider such agreements to be "market distorting and inefficient". On April 16, 1990, a US Presidential Policy statement
U.S. position on defense offsets.
U.S. is by far the largest exporter of weapons in the world, and the U.S. Government officially declares the use of offsets as unfair practices, imposed by buyers, and is also trying to shape a political coalition of other arms exporter countries to support the U.S.’s official anti-offset position.
The primary concern of the U.S. about direct offset is keeping a complete and self-sufficient industrial base for its military capabilities, since an erosion of such domestic industrial base is or may be taking place due to military (direct or indirect) offsets, such as co-production and technology transfers. The trans-nationalization of the U.S. defense industrial base is caused also by direct offsets, and this is considered a threat to national security. In U.S. there is also a more sophisticated and free market opinion on the issue of the dislocation of less advanced military components to allied countries, that is, a kind of re-visitation of the U.S. Defense Industry transformation due to the internationalization of the main U.S. Defense companies. This opinion opposes to the protectionist simplification that any dislocation of defense industrial manufacturing capabilities to other countries is a potential threat. A second connected concern is that direct offset, technology transfer, and high-tech indirect offset may help potential U.S. enemies to build a military capability to attack U.S. or U.S. interests around the world.
To be sure, both of the above concerns are real and justified, but not very realistic. The U.S. is so far advanced militarily when compared to the rest of the world that it is not reasonable thinking that direct offsets may create a threat against U.S. security, or at least, a threat that is more dangerous than the very American made exported weapons may pose to U.S. national security. Weapons export and connected military offsets are closely monitored by the Defense Department (on the military side) and by the State Department (on the political side) and by U.S. Congress. Methodologically speaking, it is an important point never to underestimate the enemy and relying on one's one superiority, but it is not realistic thinking that transferring 20 years old technologies to allied countries as offsets of a main U.S. defense sale is a threat to national security. As recent history teaches, most security threats come from domestic breaches, not from authorized tech-transfers abroad. In other words, if a defense technology transfer offset is a real defense security threats, it should not be authorized, if it is not, then using the “national security principle” in all arguments is an abuse that is detrimental to the very ground of the principle.
The most delicate and convincing issue is U.S. economic security. Economy (Competition) and War (Defense) do not follow the same principles and methods, in spite of many useful analogies and significant synergies, and this is especially true in U.S., the greatest Commercial Republic of all times. Commerce Department, through BIS, monitors U.S. offsets specifically from the point of view of the adverse effects on U.S. economy, and reporting yearly to U.S. Congress. President Bush I and Clinton nominated special Commissions to examine the issue of offsets on their unintended domestic adverse effects, focusing on their detrimental effects on U.S. and other weapons exporting nations.
To be sure, the most realistic concern is about the potential loss of jobs in U.S. The effects of almost all requested offsets by purchasing countries are the increase of turnover of the offset involved activities and the creation of more jobs. An exemplification: if the sales of Lockheed Martin planes requires the offset financing of defense components manufacturing companies in Romania, these Romanian companies would subtract a piece of the market from U.S. companies, and therefore indirectly would cause a loss of jobs in U.S. The argument follows the protectionist view that a factory in U.S. closes because another similar factory opened in Romania or Japan. From the buyer's point of view, offsets are supposed to be a form of economic policy and state intervention. However, from a strict free trade point of view the creation of wealth (production and turnovers as well jobs) in other countries is not detrimental to commercial Republics like U.S., on the contrary, it increases their purchasing power to buy U.S. defense products.
The matter of indirect offsets, and specifically civilian offset, poses other types of problems and serious economic concerns. Generally speaking indirect offsets do not affect U.S. national security. But if indirect offsets, such as marketing or financing of foreign competitors of U.S. companies, help competitors to grow internationally, or even in the U.S. domestic markets, the problem of the adverse effects of indirect offsets on U.S. economy becomes real. The interaction of defense indirect offsets with non-military U.S. business is substantial, given the amount of offset obligations of U.S. toward competing economies. BIS monitors these effects closely in all fields, but it is clear that if a U.S. marketing assistance indirect offset, for instance, helps a European company to sell its products and services in a third importing country, where a U.S. companies may sell their own equivalent products, this may constitute a relevant adverse effects of U.S. defense industry offset practices.
The most uncontrollable effects, however, is when indirect offsets strike U.S. small and medium domestic companies with no information about it, and with a protection of secrecy. This point is also present in the internal/domestic European Union market, that expresses a similar concern for the unfair distortion of normal competitive market caused by indirect non-military offsets, protected by unjustified secrecy following section
EU position on defense offsets.
The most recent common European Union quasi-agreement on defense offsets is "The Code of Conduct on Offsets" [http://www.eda.europa.eu/offsets/], signed by all EU countries (with the exception of Romania and Denmark) in October 2008. The primary purpose of the voluntary and non-binding Code is to promote a "European Defense Technological and Industrial Base" and to outline a road map to arrive to a complete elimination of offset practices within the domestic EU market. In other words, to open to competitive bids the EU Defense and Security market and to overcome competition restrictions of EU Treaties of Rome and Lisbon, art. 346. The ideal goal is “competition in the EU Defense Market” and “Government-to-Government off-the-shelf sales.” The realistic target is humbler, though: to self-restrain and limit the offset quantity to 100% of the contract value.
The actual situation in EU is described in detail in a study on defense offsets in the Union countries commissioned by the European Defense Agency and published in 2007. According to this study the volume of EU offset agreements in 2006 was above 4-5 billion euro. The distribution of these offsets is as shown in the diagram: Direct Offsets, Military Indirect Offsets, Civilian Indirect Offsets.
European policy on offsets is still regulated by the Treaty establishing the European Community. Art. 223 of the Treaty of Rome (1958), then article 296 of the EU Treaty of Amsterdam (1999); since December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon (art. 346) protects member States weapons production and trade from competition rules of the common European market. In spite of 50 years of European history Article 223 (Rome) and Article 346 (Lisbon) are practically identical. Today the hinge of EU policy on offsets is still the same article, that is, Art. 346 of the Lisbon Treaty. This article preserves the national right to the secret of state related to its own security and military production and procurement.
This is the relevant part of Article 346:
The first part of the article states that European Union has no authority over national states policies and decisions on their defense/security choices. In other words, EU has no saying about domestic preference for homemade planes or tanks, or for preferred military offsets choice. The second part, however, asserts a shared principle by all EU states regarding the non-military/indirect offsets, that is, EU reserves its right to supervise and regulate indirect-non-military offset effects, so that they do not “adversely affect the condition of competition” in the internal common EU market.
Any civilian-indirect-offset has distortion effects in the common market, and this distortion is amplified by the ignorance about specific offset agreements outside the circle of defense contractors and national authorities. U.S started monitoring offsets adverse effects in United States when a small paper-making equipment company in Wisconsin (Beloit Corporation) got in trouble without understanding that the reason was an hidden cause, that is, an indirect offset by Northrop (now Northrop Grumman) with the Finnish Ministry of Defense. Only a concerned Wisconsin politician, Sen. Russell D. Feingold, discovered the real reasons in 1992, after being informed that a tender for supply of machinery of the value about 50M USD was not awarded to the Wisconsin company, but to a Finnish company (Valmet Corporation) as part of an offset deal with the Finnish Government.
This U.S. offset story brought to light the issue of the impact of confidential agreements by defense companies on U.S. non-military business, in some instances with devastating effects. Feingold's discovery is enlightening for the EU common market as well, where interferences and adverse impacts on EU companies are allowed by an unjustified national attitude for confidentiality or secrecy on indirect, non military, offset deals. Art. 346 of Lisbon Treaty, written more than 50 years ago, is there to wisely avoid disruptive effects caused by unjustified military secrecy in civilian offsets in the common European market. In EU market of Defense, approximately of the size of $250B, with 27 sovereign state authorities that can claim secret of state -from Germany to Cyprus and Luxembourg-, there is a potential for indirect non-military offsets of $60B, that is, more 1000 times the distortion problem caused by Northrop (and the Finnish Ministry of Defense) to Beloit.
Offset associations and publications.
The two main global organizations that deal with offsets are:
One domestic U.S. based organization that deals with offsets is:
There are many regional or national offset conferences and symposiums, but recently GOCA and DMA jointly organize global offset meetings every two years. The first global meeting on offset took place in 2004 in Sintra, Portugal; then in Athens, Greece (2006); the third in Seville, Spain, in 2008. GOCA and DIOA hold both individual and joint conferences several times per year.
"Countertrade & Offset" is a fortnightly magazine on the offset industry; the same publisher has also a quarterly for the industry: "The Offset Guidelines Quarterly Bulletin".

American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry

Origins of The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry.
The American Academy of Psychoanalysis was founded in 1956. At that time, the American Psychoanalytic Association, which was the dominant psychoanalytic organization in North America, set standards for training psychoanalytic candidates at psychoanalytic institutes and certified individual psychoanalysts and institutes as well. The seventy-six Charter members who founded the Academy were concerned that focus on certification associated with a rigid Freudian framework inhibited free and open discourse about basic psychoanalytic concepts. They wanted to establish a forum for open discussion and debate but not an organization that would certify psychoanalysts or psychoanalytic institutes. The guiding philosophy of this new organization was expressed by its first President, Janet Rioch:
"The process of communication by forum is of value to encourage honest exchange of scientific opinion and observations; to build upon and expand those basic premises which survive critical scrutiny; to have the courage to discard that which cannot be regarded as scientifically valid in light of our present knowledge."
The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry welcomes new members. Applicants for membership should contact:

Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry.
Since the inception of the Academy, great changes have taken place in the practice of psychoanalysis and in the application of depth psychology (from the German term Tiefenpsychologie and commonly termed “psychoanalytic psychology”) to psychiatric symptoms, syndromes and disorders. The Academy changed its name to The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry and became an Affiliate organization of the American Psychiatric Association in 1998. From originally being an organization of medical psychoanalysts, the Academy became an organization of psychiatrists interested in all aspects of psychodynamic psychiatry. Psychoanalysis as a treatment technique remains one of its many interests. The membership of The Academy consists of psychiatrists, psychiatric residents, and medical students. Researchers and scholars who are not psychiatrists are welcomed as Scientific Associates.
What Is Psychodynamic Psychiatry?
Psychodynamic psychiatry is a new discipline that has emerged from a fusion of psychoanalytic and extra-psychoanalytic psychology, neuroscience and academic psychiatry.
Psychodynamic treatments are based on assessment that is carried out from a developmental perspective. Particular attention is paid to the person’s present and past psychiatric illnesses, experiences of trauma, and family history. The patient’s behavior is reported both descriptively using established psychiatric diagnostic criteria from the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -DSM- and from the International Classification of Diseases –ICD-. The patient’s behavior is in addition understood in terms of subjectively constructed narratives.
Psychodynamic psychiatry accepts concepts that are clinically useful and/or scientifically important but discards those that have not stood the test of time. Although it enthusiastically endorses research, it also recognizes that much knowledge about normal and abnormal behavior (however these terms are defined) is based on clinical experience. Thus, for example, the official journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry is entitled Psychodynamic Psychiatry and publishes clinical case discussions as well as scholarly reviews and research investigations. As time goes on, psychodynamic psychiatry as a body of knowledge will change as more is learned about the relationships between neuroscience, psychopathology, and individual feelings and behavior.
All psychodynamic treatments are organized around a therapeutic alliance forged by both participants. They include psychoanalysis, briefer therapies and combinations of therapies including, for example, individual and group psychotherapy, family therapy and/or pharmacotherapy. Psychodynamically oriented treatments may be of any duration from a single meeting to weeks to years. They may take place anywhere the practitioner meets with a patient—not only in the outpatient setting but in inpatient psychiatric services, the emergency ward, and general hospital medical and surgical settings where consultation-liaison psychiatrists use developmental principles and alliance with the patient to render care. In other words, wherever the psychodynamically trained psychiatrist interacts with a patient, the practitioner uses a developmental approach to understand that person and help him or her get better.
Activities of The Academy.
All activities of the Academy foster communication and discussion of psychodynamic concepts as expressed in clinical treatment, research, psychological development and diverse other ways as well. A major priority of The Academy is to teach the principles of psychodynamic psychiatry to medical students, psychiatric residents and other mental health professionals and students. The specific activities include:
-Annual Meeting Of The Academy- The meetings take place immediately prior to the annual meeting of The American Psychiatric Association (APA) and are usually organized around a central theme. For example, the meeting in 2013 was focused on suicide the suicidal patient.
-Symposia and Workshops at the American Psychiatric Convention and the Institute on Psychiatric Services (IPS) 
-Annual meeting in Italy co-sponsored with OPIFER (Organizzazione Psicoanalisti Italiania Federazione e Registro).
-Regular meetings in Washington DC co-sponsored with the Consortium for Psychoanalytic Research.
Psychodynamic Psychiatry.
Psychodynamic Psychiatry, the official journal of The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, published by Guilford Press, was created in response to the need for the continued study and teaching of psychodynamic concepts in organized psychiatry. Psychodynamic Psychiatry is the only psychiatric journal exclusively devoted to the study and discussion of these issues.
The central tenet of the journal is that psychodynamic principles are necessary for adequately understanding and treating people with psychiatric symptoms, syndromes and disorders. Its guiding framework is developmental and bio-psycho-social.
The journal publishes review articles, clinical discussions and research. Psychodynamic Psychiatry is edited by Richard C. Friedman MD. Cesar Alfonso MD and Jennifer I. Downey MD are Deputy Editors.
From 1958 to 1972 the Academy published its proceedings in monograph form under the rubric “Science and Psychoanalysis” edited by Jules Masserman MD. In 1973 Silvano Arieti became the first editor of the Journal which was entitled Journal of The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry. Subsequent Editors- in Chief included Morton Cantor MD, Jules Bemporad MD and Douglas Ingram MD. When Richard C. Friedman MD became Editor in Chief in 2012, the journal’s name was changed to Psychodynamic Psychiatry.
Psychoanalytic Forum.
The Forum focuses on psychoanalytic articles about art and culture. It is edited by Gerald Perlman MD. The Academy also publishes two newsletters.
Teichner Scholars Program.
The late Victor J Teichner MD was a former President of the AAPDP. A grateful patient established a fund making it possible to impart the spirit of Dr. Teichner’s creative therapeutic perspective to psychiatric clinicians in training.
The Victor J. Teichner Award is made annually to one psychiatric residency program on the basis of an application to the Award Committee, composed of representatives of the AAPDP and the AADPRT (American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training). Its focus is to promote the teaching of psychodynamic principles to psychiatrists-in-training. The Program Awardee receives a one to three day visit from a Visiting Scholar chosen from a list maintained by the AAPDP. The choice of the Visiting Scholar and structure of the visit are made by the Program. The visit must take place during the academic year beginning July 1, after the announcement of the Awardee.

Mod Cup

The Mod Cup is a trophy in the sport of shinty first competed for in 1969, traditionally played for by the two teams who are based closest to the host venue of the Royal National Mod. The current holders are Bute Shinty Club.
History.
The Cup is presented by the Aviemore branch of An Comunn Gaidhealach as part of the week long Mod as a celebration of shinty's links with Scottish Gaelic. The first running of the cup was in 1969 as the Mod was held in Aviemore and the two closest sides were the sport's historic giants, Kingussie and Newtonmore. Newtonmore won the first running of the cup and to this day the Mod Cup is perhaps the one trophy that the club is eligible to compete for that Kingussie has never won.
Over the years, the Mod has been held in towns without shinty teams which has resulted in teams being imported (Stornoway Mods in the 1980s, when Beauly Shinty Club and Skye Camanachd or in areas with a plethora of shinty teams, such as the Lochaber Mod 2007 when a select Lochaber East Side played Lochaber West in Ardnamurchan. The expansion of shinty into areas where it had previously not been played for a long time means that there should be teams from that locale competing for the trophy in future. This was the case with the Caithness Mod in 2010 [http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1938764?UserKey=] and the Western Isles Mod in 2011.
The 2004 fixture was played between Tayforth and Edinburgh East Lothian, at South Inch, Perth.
The 2008 fixture was to be competed for between Aberdour Shinty Club and Glasgow Mid-Argyll at Little Kerse, Grangemouth as part of the Mod in Falkirk. However, the fixture was rained off. 
The 2009 fixture was played between Lochside Rovers and Oban Celtic at Mossfield Park, Oban on 10 October 2009[http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1428533?UserKey=] as part of a normal league fixture which Lochside won. The Cup provides many smaller teams with an opportunity to win national silverware.
The 2010 fixture between Caithness and Sutherland was an historic game as it was the most northerly official shinty game ever played. Caithness won 3-1.[http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1938764?UserKey=]
The 2011 final was played in Uist, and was contested between Uist and Lewis, with Lewis gaining revenge over their 2005 conquerors, winning 2-0.

Gilbert Motier de La Fayette

Gilbert Motier de La Fayette, (1380 - 22 February 1464) Lord of La Fayette, Pontgibaud Ayes, Nébouzac, Saint-Romain and Monteil Gelat was a Marshal of France
He was brought up at the court of Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. He served under Marshal Boucicaut in Italy and on his return to France after the evacuation of Genoa in 1409 became seneschal of the Bourbonnais.
He was the comrade of Joan of Arc. 
In the English wars he was with John I, Duke of Bourbon, at the capture of Soubise in 1413 and of Compiègne in 1415. The duke then made him lieutenant-general in Languedoc and Guienne. He failed to defend Caen and Falaise, for the dauphin (afterwards Charles VII.) against Henry V of England in 1417 and 1418, but in the latter years he held Lyons for some time against Jean, duke of Burgundy. A series of successes over the English and Burgundians on the Loire was rewarded in 1420 with the government of Dauphiné and the office of marshal of France.
He commanded the Franco-Scottish troops at the Battle of Baugé in 1422, though he did not, as has been sometimes stated, slay Thomas, duke of Clarence, with his own hand. In 1424, he was taken prisoner by the English at the battle of Verneuil, but was released shortly afterwards, and fought with Joan of Arc at the siege of Orléans, and the battle of Patay in 1429.
The marshal had become a member of the grand council of Charles VII, and with the exception of a short disgrace about 1430, due to the ill-will of Georges de la Trémoille, he retained the royal favour all his life. He took an active part in the army reform initiated by Charles VII, and the establishment of military posts for the suppression of brigandage. His last campaign was against the English in Normandy in 1449. He died on 23 February 1462.
He was buried in the Abbey of La Chaise-Dieu.
Family.
He was the son of William Motier La Fayette and Catherine of Peschin.
He married Montroignon, and his second wife, Jeanne de Joyeuse, on January 15, 1423, daughter of Randon de Joyeuse lord, and Catherine Aubert, lady Monteil Gelat. 
They had nine children by his second marriage, including:

Biography.
Astyplaz is a neologism.<br>
It is composed of the word 'asty' which in Ancient Greek means city and the French word 'plage' meaning beach.<br> With this neologism, more or less a poetical metaphor of beach culture to the city is achieved (city beach).
Astyplaz is an Athens based 4 piece electronica/synth pop outfit.
In the autumn of 2005 Astyplaz debut album Name your Slippers' was released (L Music – Canada). The album title was inspired by the controversial author G.C. Lichtenberg (1742 - 1799 who was considered a forerunner of Surrealism).
Following the debut album release, a series of live concerts ensued, playing alongside names such as Faithless (to a crowd of 5,000), Chemical Brothers, Soft Cell, DAF, Covenant, Haujobb, Melotron, Sigmatropic and Mikro. Astyplaz also performed as headline act in concerts throughout Athens and in other cities of Greece such as Patras, Thessaloniki and Larissa.
November 2006 will find Astyplaz making their first official North America tour.
(Montreal – Toronto – New York – New Jersey – Boston – Cleveland – Minneapolis – Chicago).
This tour makes Astyplaz the first English-speaking Greek (non metal) band to tour Canada and the U.S.
With the commencement of 2007 Astyplaz continue their live appearances, this time in Australia (Sydney-Melbourne-Brisbane).
This is the first time a Greek band with English lyrics has toured Australian cities.

Luria isabella

Luria isabella, common name the Isabel's Cowry or Fawn-coloured Cowry, is a species of sea snail, a cowry, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Cypraeidae, the cowries.
Description.
The shells of these very common cowries reach on average of length, with a minimum size of and a maximum size of . The basic color of these cylindrical-shaped shells is light beige or fawn or pale reddish-brown, the dorsum surface is crossed by thin discontinuous longitudinal markings and the extremities show orange-red terminal spots. The base is mainly white and the long and narrow aperture has several short teeth. In the living cowries the well developed mantle is black matt and almost velvety, with external short antennae.
Distribution.
This species lives in the Red Sea, along the East African coast, the Mascarene Basin and in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean (Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, Melanesia, Philippines, Southern Japan, Taiwan) up to Hawaii.
Habitat.
Living cowries of this species can be encountered in a wide range of habitats, in shallow and in intertidal waters up to about of depth. During the day they usually stay under rocks and stones or in small holes or coral caves. At dawn or dusk they start feeding on sponges, algae or coral polyps.
Subspecies.
There have been a great many subspecies named, but most names are very dubious. However the following are generally accepted as valid names:

<doc id="19688803" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19688803" title="Nationalisation of Northern Rock">
Nationalisation of Northern Rock

In 2008 the Northern Rock bank was nationalised by the British Government, due to financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage crisis. In 2010 the bank was split into two parts (assets and banking) to aid the eventual sale of the bank back to the private sector.
On 14 September 2007, the Bank sought and received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, following problems in the credit markets, during the current financial crisis. On 22 February 2008 the bank was taken into state ownership. The nationalisation was a result of two unsuccessful bids to take over the bank, neither being able to fully commit to repayment of savers and investors money.
On 17 November 2011 it was announced that Virgin Money were going to buy Northern Rock for £747 million, from UK Financial Investments Limited (UKFI). The deal was finalised on 1 January 2012 and by October of that year the high street bank operated under the Virgin Money brand.
2007 credit crisis.
Emergence.
On 12 September 2007, Northern Rock asked the Bank of England, as lender of last resort in the United Kingdom, for a liquidity support facility due to problems in raising funds in the money market to replace maturing money market borrowings. The problems arose from difficulties banks faced over the summer of 2007 in raising funds in the money market. The bank's assets were always sufficient to cover its liabilities, but it had a liquidity problem because institutional lenders became nervous about lending to mortgage banks following the US sub-prime crisis. Bank of England figures suggest that Northern Rock borrowed £3 billion from the Bank of England in the first few days of this crisis.
Government intervention.
With shares in Northern Rock plummeting by nearly a third, the British Government moved to reassure investors with the bank, with account holders urged not to worry about the bank going bust. The Treasury select committee chairman John McFall MP said: "I don't think customers of Northern Rock should be worried about their current accounts or mortgages."
Northern Rock is not the only British bank to have called on the Bank of England for funds since the sub-prime crisis began but is the only one to have had emergency financial support from the Tripartite Authority (The Bank of England, the FSA and HM Treasury). However, the bank was more vulnerable to a credit crunch as its 'high risk' business model depended on funding from the wholesale credit markets, 75% of its funds coming from this source. In his address to the Treasury Select Committee, Bank of England governor Mervyn King had stated emergency funds would be made available to any British bank that needed it, but at a penalty rate, to ensure that lenders who had made bad lending decisions would suffer relative to lenders who had made sensible lending decisions.
In December, the EU regulators approved Britain's actions to provide aid to the Bank by concluding that it was in line with European emergency aid rules.
Run on the bank.
On Friday 14 September 2007, the first day branches opened following the news, many customers queued outside branches to withdraw their savings (a run on the bank). This bank run was not the traditional form, where depositors withdraw money in a snowball effect, leading to a liquidity crisis; instead, it occurred in the aftermath of the liquidity crisis. It was estimated that £1 billion was withdrawn by customers that day, about 5% of the total bank deposits held by Northern Rock. In one incident, police were called to the branch in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, when two joint account holders barricaded the bank manager in her office after she refused to let them withdraw £1 million from their account. Their money was held in an internet-only account, which they were unable to access after the Northern Rock website failed due to the volume of customers trying to log on. Journalists such as the BBC's Robert Peston, who broke the news on his blog, have been seen as one of the main causes of the bank run.
On Monday 17 September, as worried savers continued to flock to some Northern Rock bank branches to withdraw their savings, it was reported that an estimated £2 billion had been withdrawn since the bank applied to the Bank of England for emergency funds. By early afternoon in London, Northern Rock's shares, which had lost 32% on the previous Friday, fell a further 40% from 438 pence to 263 pence.
Later that day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, announced that the British Government and the Bank of England would guarantee all deposits held at Northern Rock. Northern Rock shares rose by 16% after this was announced.
Stabilisation.
The announcement by the Chancellor showed its intended effects the next day, as the queues outside Northern Rock's branches gradually disappeared. In addition, Northern Rock had a series of adverts published in major UK newspapers to reaffirm that their customers' money was safe.
In an interview on BBC Radio 4, Bank of England governor Mervyn King revealed that they had anticipated emergency funding to be in the £20–30bn range.
Boardroom changes.
Matt Ridley was forced to resign as chairman in 2007, having been blamed in parliamentary committee hearings for not recognising the risks of the bank's financial strategy and thereby "harming the reputation of the British banking industry."
John Devaney and Simon Laffin joined the board in November 2007, when Sir Derek Wanless, Nichola Pease, Adam Fenwick and Rosemary Radcliffe retired as Non-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive Adam Applegarth stayed on in a caretaker role until December 2007. David Baker and Keith Currie left the board, but remained employed within the company. Currie later took early retirement with a bonus package reportedly worth £2.5 million, and in 2012, aged 56, was found dead at his home after reportedly suffering from depression over the bank's demise.
The Chief Executive after the departure of Applegarth was Andy Kuipers, who joined the company in 1987, and later left on 31 August 2008.
Growth of Bank of England loan.
By January 2008, Northern Rock's loan from the Bank of England had grown to £26bn. On 11 January, Northern Rock announced that it had sold its portfolio of lifetime home equity release mortgages to JP Morgan for £2.2bn and that it would use this to pay off a piece of the Bank of England loan.
On 6 February, the Office for National Statistics announced that it was treating Northern Rock as a public corporation, similar to the BBC and Royal Mail for accounting purposes, causing the loans (approximately £25 billion) and guarantees (approximately £30 billion) extended by the Bank of England and the value of the company's mortgage book (approximately £55 billion), provisionally estimated to total around £100 billion, to be added to the National Debt. Although not technically a nationalisation, the decision effectively acknowledged that "In all but name, Northern Rock is now nationalised".
The addition of this borrowing to the Government's totals increases the National Debt from £537 billion, or 37.7% of GDP to around 45%, breaking the so-called Golden Rule which sets the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement threshold at below 40%. The figure is the equivalent of £3,000 additional borrowing for every family in Britain. In the 2008 Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the government would issue £14 billion of gilts in order to cover the Northern Rock debt.
Handling of the crisis.
On 26 March the Financial Services Authority released an internal report into the failings over handling the problems at Northern Rock. "They found that their supervision of the bank had not been carried out to a standard that is acceptable". The previous FSA review had taken place in February 2006. In the light of these failings at Northern Rock, the FSA announced that they would overhaul their own staffing and systems. The FSA internal report also concluded that ultimately the blame for the collapse of Northern Rock should sit at the feet of the bank's senior management. "The boards and managements of regulated firms carry the primary responsibility for ensuring their institutions' financial soundness," the FSA said. The British Bankers' Association (BBA), the UK banking body, agreed.
In May 2009 the "Financial Times" reported that banking regulators had been examining "war games" as early as 2004, which dealt with possible turmoil in the mortgage markets. HBOS and Northern Rock are thought to have featured in these predictions.
Commencing in October 2007, the All Party Commons Treasury Select Committee undertook a report into the failure of Northern Rock. The Committee held several televised meetings, in which they called witnesses from the former Board of Northern Rock, the Bank of England, the Treasury, and the regulatory bodies. The report was detailed, and concluded that "the (former) Directors of Northern Rock were the principal authors of its difficulties" :-
"The directors of Northern Rock were the principal authors of the difficulties that the company has faced since August 2007. It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on liquidity support from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term wholesale funding and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members."
Financial performance.
Prior to the subprime mortgage crisis the bank was part of the FTSE 100 Index, but was demoted back to the FTSE 250 in December 2007. The shares were later delisted.
On 31 March the bank released its annual report for 2007, it showed a loss of £167 million. The former boss, Adam Applegarth received a £760,000 (£63,333 a month) payoff. The report also outlined further details of their proposed business plan.
On 5 August the bank announced that it had made a loss of £585.4m for the first 6 months of the year and that £9.4bn of a loan from the Bank of England had been paid back, reducing the amount owed to £17.5bn.
Takeover offers.
Virgin.
On 12 October 2007, Virgin Group announced that it intended to bid for Northern Rock as the lead partner in a coalition including American giant AIG, turnaround specialist WL Ross and First Eastern Investment. Had the deal been successful, Northern Rock would have been integrated into Virgin Money as Virgin Bank.
It is unclear what role partners would have had in the deal. This bid was later approved by the UK Treasury and had been noted as the preferred option. Virgin announced that Peter McNamara, a former Alliance & Leicester managing director, would be responsible for risk management at Northern Rock if its bid succeeds.
Other bidders.
The other front-runner was an investment company Olivant, headed by the former chief executive of Abbey, Luqman Arnold. Olivant would have kept the Northern Rock brand. By 17 November, a total of ten companies had put forward proposals for the bank. Among the other suitors for Northern Rock were private equity firm Cerberus, JC Flowers and Lloyds TSB. In early December JC Flowers, dropped out of the bidding.
In March 2009, it was revealed that Lehman Brothers and Bradford & Bingley had tabled bids for Northern Rock in December 2007; both of these bidders later fell victim themselves to the banking crisis. Terra Firma Capital Partners, a private equity company, also wanted to purchase some of Northern Rock's prime assets.
Bids rejection.
Northern Rock announced that all offers had been "materially below" the previous trading value. Alistair Darling said on 19 November that the Government would have to approve or veto any sale, in the interests of taxpayers, depositors and wider financial stability.
Possible nationalisation.
In December the Government prepared emergency legislation to nationalise the Bank, in the event that the takeover bids fail. On 12 January 2008, the Treasury recruited Ron Sandler, the former Lloyd's of London Chief Executive, to lead Northern Rock, in the event that the bank was nationalised. If the Bank was to be temporarily nationalised, the government would manage the Bank at "arm's length" on a commercial basis, where services for savers and borrowers would not be affected and the company would continue to operate as normal. However nationalisation would also address the future of the Northern Rock Foundation. Alistair Darling rejected the possibility of the Bank being put into administration.
In-house proposal.
On 15 December, Northern Rock hired the bank Goldman Sachs to put together a financing package, to assemble backers and present proposals to its board. This package would be available to any potential bidder for the bank. The in-house bid was led by Paul Thompson and Andy Kuipers.
Final bids.
The deadline for bids was 4 February 2008, where final bids were expected from Virgin, Olivant and the bank’s management; other bidders could still have expressed interest. Goldman Sachs were likely to contact Cerberus and JC Flowers to see if they would like to rejoin the bidding, now that the situation has materially changed. When a successful proposal has been chosen, it will be put to the European Commission by 17 March, which would consider whether it conformed to EU state aid rules. Olivant pulled out of the bidding (but stated that they may have still attempted a rescue bid if the Government changed their conditions) on 4 February leaving just the Virgin bid and the in-house bid.
For repayment of the Government loans, there was a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders to have to find their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers’ deposits.
Nationalisation.
On 17 February 2008, Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that Northern Rock was to be nationalised claiming that the private bids did not offer "sufficient value for money to the taxpayer" and thus the bank was to be brought under a "temporary period of public ownership".
The government is the sole shareholder through UK Financial Investments Limited, and the Bank is managed at "arm's length" on a commercial basis by an independent board under Ron Sandler. Customers are not affected by this change.
A Government-appointed arbitration panel will decide on a fair price for the compensation to be offered to investors for their shares. Prior to the markets opening on 18 February, trading in Northern Rock's ordinary and preference shares on the London Stock Exchange was suspended. The legal authorisation for the nationalisation is the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which also allows for the nationalisation of other banks if necessary. At 00:01 on 22 February Northern Rock was formally nationalised.
In November 2008 the government set up a new company, UK Financial Investments Limited, to manage their shareholdings in Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley. On 10 March 2009 the Office of Fair Trading published their report on the impacts of public support for Northern Rock on competition in financial services. The OFT concluded that "public support for Northern Rock did not, during that period, have a significantly adverse impact on competition."
Boardroom changes.
In February 2008, Ron Sandler was appointed Executive Chairman by the government. Bryan Sanderson, Sir Ian Gibson, David Jones and Paul Thompson resigned from the board at this time. Gary Hoffman became Chief Executive of Northern Rock in October 2008. He has previously been the vice chairman of Barclays and a former Managing Director of Barclaycard. With the appointment of Gary Hoffman, Ron Sandler changed to a Non-Executive Chairman position. On 4 November 2010 Hoffman left the bank to move to NBNK; Sandler reverted to his Executive Chairman position.
In October 2008, the post-nationalisation management of Northern Rock decided not to bring legal action for negligence against the directors in charge during the crisis, including former chief executive Adam Applegarth, citing insufficient grounds to do so. There will be no action either against the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers.
In January 2009 it was announced that Ann Godbehere would be leaving her post as Chief Financial Officer at the end of February.
Some former directors of the bank have been fined and banned by the FSA including former deputy chief executive David Baker £504,000 for misreporting mortgage arrears data and former credit director Richard Barclay was fined £140,000 for failing to ensure accurate financial information. In April finance director David Jones quit the bank after reports that the FSA were to further investigate the activities at the bank prior to the nationalisation. In July Jones was fined and banned by the FSA.
Offshore mortgage book.
It has subsequently become known that the best book of Northern Rock's mortgage business, comprising mortgages worth £47 billion - some 40% of the company's assets - had been transferred to a Channel Islands based company called Granite, together with an ongoing obligation to continue to supply business. Failure to maintain the arrangement could cost a reported £5 billion. As is common practice in bank securitisations, Granite was set up as a charitable trust with any residue on winding-up to benefit a small charity, Down's Syndrome North East. Despite having assets worth an estimated £45 billion, Granite has never made a donation to the charity, because it remains in business.
In late 2008, Northern Rock, advised by Credit Suisse, decided to let Granite go into run-off, meaning that Northern Rock the bank will no longer supply it with fresh mortgages and bondholders will be repaid as old mortgages expire.
Debt reduction strategy.
On 18 March, Northern Rock announced the measures that it would be taking to reduce the government debt within three to four years. The bank is to cut around a third of jobs (2,000) by 2011; on 1 May the bank confirmed that they would be initialising talks with the unions and that most of the job losses would be later in 2008.
As of 30 September 2008 the bank is repaying the loan well ahead of target, owing a net balance of only £11.5 billion of the loan that stood at £26.9 billion at the end of 2007.
On 21 October Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised their outlook on Northern Rock to stable from positive; they also affirmed the bank's long and short-term 'A/A-1' counterparty credit ratings. The Press Association noted on 22 October that Northern Rock may give their employees bonuses in the future, if certain targets in paying back the Government loan are met.
On 21 January 2009 it was revealed that the bank's employees would receive a 10% bonus, due to the bank meeting its targets for repaying the Government loan. This caused some unrest from a number of media outlets and the Liberal Democrats' Vince Cable for example, but the decision to issue the bonus was defended by the Unite union, calling it a reward for their hard work and dedication.
On 3 March 2009 Northern Rock noted that only £8.9 billion of the loan remained unpaid.
On 1 October 2010 the bank announced that another £700 million had been paid off of the loan in the last three months.
Job losses.
At the end of July 2008 Northern Rock announced the first set of redundancies; 800 staff were made compulsorily redundant and a further 500 staff left under a voluntary redundancy programme. It is also aiming to halve its £100 billion loan book by either selling off mortgage assets to other lenders or by declining to offer new mortgages to existing customers.
On 8 June 2010 as a part of the restructuring process it was announced that a further 650 jobs would be lost in the North East locations of the bank before the end of the year.
In a report commissioned by development agency One North East it was detailed that the downfall of the bank cost the local region around £800 million, mainly in relation to the job losses. The report was kept confidential until 2010, and now the bank claims that is 
On 28 March 2011 the bank announced that it was likely that around 680 more jobs would go during the restructuring prior to the bank's return to private sector.
Danish operations.
On 18 March, Northern Rock announced the termination of its Danish savings operation. All accounts in the Danish branch were closed on 18 April 2008.
Lloyds TSB deal.
On 5 June it was announced that Lloyds TSB, a former bidder for the bank, would assume a proportion of the Northern Rock mortgage book over 3 years; this would be achieved by Lloyds TSB offering new mortgages to Northern Rock customers who are nearing the end of their fixed-rate deals.
Sponsorship.
It was confirmed on 20 May 2008 that Northern Rock would continue to sponsor both Newcastle United and the Newcastle Falcons, the former due to the long-term agreement between them and the club. Chief Executive Ron Sandler was quoted as saying:
"We have already ended a number of sponsorships that I inherited... but we have chosen to continue the sponsorship of Newcastle United and Newcastle Falcons, partly because of commitments we have entered into there - sometimes sponsorships continue until they come to a contractual end - and partly because I believe it is in the commercial interest of the bank that we should continue with both of these."
In 2007, almost three weeks before the bank had to appeal to the Bank of England for an emergency loan, the bank bought the home ground of Newcastle Falcons Rugby Club, Kingston Park stadium for £15 million. In February 2008, documents relating to the sale came to light, attracting much criticism that the purchase has been made at a time of impending crisis. In late 2008 the bank sold Kingston Park stadium to Northumbria University for an undisclosed fee.
On 18 January 2010 Northern Rock announced that they had signed a new 4 year sponsorship deal with Newcastle United, worth between £1.5 million and £10 million, starting from the 2010/11 season. The sponsorship agreement with the Newcastle Falcons came to an end before the start of the 2010/11 season.
Head office and "The Tower".
At the time of its nationalisation, Northern Rock was developing two new offices. At its headquarters at the Regent Centre complex in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne the bank was mid-way through construction of a 10-storey tower that would provide a focus for the whole site. As the redundancy programme has made the new space surplus to capacity, the bank sought to sell or lease the tower building to a third party. The bank also developed a site at Rainton Bridge, which was also surplus to capacity, and it sold the site to npower.
In April 2009, the local council, Newcastle City Council, announced that they were to buy the building for £22 million, and lease it to a green support services company, Eaga. By November the sale of the building was complete, and the council renamed it Partnership House.
Northern Rock Foundation.
Prior to Nationalisation, the company donated substantial amounts annually to its own charity, the "Northern Rock Foundation". Nationalisation ended the covenant requiring Northern Rock to remit a share of profits to the Foundation. Instead, for the next three years the Foundation will receive an annual £15 million payment from Northern Rock, whether it remains publicly owned or returns to the private sector. The Foundation's shares were cancelled and compensated in the same way as those of other shareholders.
Shareholders, hedge funds and legal action.
Two hedge funds that owned 20% of the bank, SRM Global and RAB Capital, took legal action against the Government, regulators and individuals whose nationalisation of the bank, they believed to have been inappropriate, and a contributory factor to the current crisis. On 15 January 2008, a meeting was held at the 11,000 seat Metro Radio Arena to discuss the situation which then existed, where all but one of the proposals put forward by the hedge funds were rejected. In May Legal & General joined the hedge funds, as an "interested party". The hedge funds are to request that an independent valuer assesses the level of compensation and to argue that the bank's shares are worth more than the final price of their trading prior to nationalisation. This legal action is thought to have started on 8 May. A number of Northern Rock shareholders have also taken action in an attempt to get some level of compensation for their shares. Three North Labour MPs have agreed to hand a series of petitions in, on behalf of shareholders who lost hundreds of thousands of pounds when their shares were confiscated.
As of 6 July around about 10 firms had applied to value the Bank. "The Times" reported on 3 August that Houlihan Lokey, BDO Stoy Hayward and L.E.K. Consulting were the three companies short listed by the government to value the bank. On 9 September "The Times" reported that Andrew Caldwell, a valuations partner at BDO Stoy Hayward had been chosen as the valuer, with a fee of £4.5 million.
The legal action brought by investors against the Government started in the Royal Courts of Justice on 13 January 2009. Shareholders were also staging a demonstration outside the court. One of the points that was revealed about the case is that they were examining who 'leaked' the information about the bank receiving its emergency government bailout. In order to give full consideration, Lord Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Silber reserved their decision, before they gave a written judgment of the case. On 13 February it was announced that the shareholders had lost the case. Roger Lawson of the UK Shareholders Association said that there was a 'good chance' that they would appeal the decision.
In May 2009, it was reported that Sir Anthony Clarke and two other senior judges in the Court of Appeal would hear the next stage in the judicial review starting on 10 June for three days. On 28 July it was revealed that the shareholders lost their appeal, but some shareholders said that they would now try to take the case to the House of Lords. On 22 December it was reported that the shareholders had again lost their appeal, and now they will be going to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
On 8 December it was announced that the Northern Rock shareholders were to get no compensation, based on the findings of the valuer Andrew Caldwell. This then went to a tribunal, 'Northern Rock v. Andrew Caldwell and HM Treasury, Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber), NR/001/2010, where the shareholders' appeal was rejected.
In 2011 Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, an entity which had held an interest in some £277 million preference shares in Northern Rock, and Chris Hulme, chairman of the Northern Rock Shareholders Action Group, lost their legal battle to overturn the valuation of the shares being worthless. In January 2013 Harbinger's appeal is being heard in London.
Repossession accusations.
In October 2008 a small number of charities and media outlets accused Northern Rock of having an aggressive repossession policy. These allegations were denied by the bank's spokesman Simon Hall.
Restoration of confidence.
By October customers appeared to be regaining confidence in the bank, when it emerged that there had been a surge in the number of new accounts which had been opened. People appeared to see Northern Rock as a safe place to put their money, given the current status as a nationalised bank which cannot fail. The bank decided to remove some of their savings products from the market, as the bank has a commitment to take only a 1.5% share of total UK retail deposits.
In January 2009 the media began to speculate about the Government having plans to use Northern Rock as a way of boosting lending. On 19 January, it was announced that Northern Rock would change its business strategy by offering more retention deals to its existing mortgage borrowers as their products expire, hence taking longer to pay back the remainder of its Government loan. Alistair Darling noted that it was "not appropriate for Northern Rock to continue to shrink its activities". "The Daily Mail" reported on 23 January, that the Government were considering injecting up to £10 billion into Northern Rock, as a new business plan at the bank. However, the European Commission may object to changes in how the bank is run, and that it may break EU state aid rules, and are investigating the matter.
In late February media sources began reporting that a section of the bank was to become a "good bank", issuing more mortgages, when it is injected with £10-14 billion by the Government. On 23 February 2009 Northern Rock announced that they would be offering £14 billion worth of new mortgages, over the next two years, as a part of their new business plan. This new lending was partly funded by an increase in the government loan, a reversal of previous strategy to pay the loan off as quickly as possible by actively encouraging mortgage customers to leave when their mortgage deal matures. The reason for this change being government policy to increase the availability of credit. This £14 billion was split into £5 billion in 2009 and £9 billion in 2010.
In March 2009 mortgages issued by the bank rose by 70%, compared to the previous month. In February 2010 "The Times" claimed that Northern Rock was interested in buying some of the branches of RBS and Lloyds.
In February 2010 the government decided to remove the 100% guarantee of the deposits at Northern Rock. Savers received 3 months notice before the removal of the guarantee at the end of May. This means that, like most banks, only the first £50,000 (as at October 2011 this figure is £85,000 - see fscs.org.uk) deposited is guaranteed.
Eventual return to the private sector.
When the British Government nationalised the bank, they noted that it was to be a temporary measure, and one of their aims was eventually return the bank back to the private sector. On 26 April 2009, "The Times" suggested that Northern Rock would be sold by the Government by the end of 2009. Potential buyers include Virgin Money, National Australia Bank, Santander, Blackstone and TowerBrook. "The Times" noted that a British supermarket chain, Tesco, interested in buying parts of the bank. It is thought that adviser Credit Suisse examined the plans to split the bank into 2 parts, to separate the most toxic loans and assets into a "bad bank". In May 2009 the EU demanded more information about the split. Another possibility is a bond debt buyback.
A spokesperson for the bank said that the sale of the bank is just one option, and there is currently no time scale. Reuters noted that there were considerations to sell the bank, but no formal discussions were taking place with potential buyers. Alistair Darling has stated that he is in no "hurry" to return the bank back to the private sector.
In January 2010 National Australia Bank were widely reported to have lined up potential advisers on the deal to buy the Northern Rock. NAB already own two brands in the UK, Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks. Also in January 2010 Virgin purchased a small bank, the Church House Trust, but according to "the Times" and other sources Virgin still have an interest in Northern Rock and have been contacting companies such as Blackstone.
In July 2010 it was reported that a consortium of City executives were gathering to place a bid for Northern Rock using the vehicle NBNK Investments. UKFI have been briefed on the proposals. On 4 November Gary Hoffman left Northern Rock to become CEO at NBNK Investments. Hoffman was put on gardening leave by Northern Rock until he joins NBNK on 1 May 2011. Hoffman was to receive a package worth around £500,000 for his gardening leave, but decided to turn it down. Due to Hoffman's previous position NBNK Investments cannot table a bid for Northern Rock for a period of 12 months from 1 November 2010.
In January 2011 renewed speculation about the bank's sale was reported as it emerged that UKFI were beginning to search for both advisers and suitors for the potential sale. On 11 March Deutsche Bank AG were appointed to be the advisers for Northern Rock's return to the private sector.
On 28 March 2011 the bank announced that it was likely that around 680 more jobs would go during the restructuring prior to the bank's return to private sector.
On 15 June 2011 it was announced that the bank is to be sold to a single buyer in the private sector by the end of the year.
On 17 November 2011 the UK Government announced the sale of Northern Rock to Virgin Money for £747m.
Banking and assets split.
On 26 June 2009 the bank confirmed that it was to be split into two parts, an "assetco" and "bankco". The plan was also to include that the remaining amount of the government loan was to be repaid by the end of 2010. On 28 October the European Commission waived through plans to split the bank off and sell the "good" parts off. On 8 December the Northern Rock plc Transfer Order 2009 was laid before parliament and in this the Treasury announced that this restructuring would take place from 1 January 2010.
There are two companies; the first being a new company, to be re-registered with the name "Northern Rock plc", which contains the bank's retail and wholesale deposit business, and the second being the current Northern Rock plc renamed to "Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc", which retains the balance of the bank's mortgage book, the Government loan, other borrowings, derivatives and certain wholesale deposits (held on behalf of Granite). The bank, "Northern Rock plc", would be offering new savings and mortgage products, but the other company, "Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc", will not.
The subsidiary in Guernsey, Northern Rock (Guernsey) Limited, and all Irish accounts are owned by the new Northern Rock plc.
After the split there are two boards of directors; Ron Sandler is the Chairman of the new Northern Rock plc and Richard Pym is Chairman of the Asset Management company. Gary Hoffman is Chief Executive of both companies.
On 10 March 2010 Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc announced that for the year 2009 the company made a better than expected loss of £257.4 million; this was a vast improvement on the previous year's losses of £1.36 billion. Due to the year's performance staff were awarded a total of £13.4 million in bonuses. Chief Executive Gary Hoffman waived his bonus payout of £700,000.
As a part of the restructuring the Guernsey business was shut down on 2 September 2010. Customers of the Guernsey business were given three months notice.
The €650 million worth of Irish deposits were sold to Permanent TSB in 2011.
On 23 July 2012 it was announced that Virgin would be acquiring £465 million worth of mortgage assets from Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc. In July 2013, private equity firm JC Flowers agreed to buy $450 million of the bank’s loans from the British Government.
In December 2012 an administrative error was uncovered in the wording of the loan agreements made by the bank in 2008 for around 152,000 customers; the error may cost an estimated £270 million. As a result of the error the affected customers, who were borrowing £25,000 or less, may be entitled to a repayment of interest.
Bradford & Bingley mortgage book merger.
Around the time of the nationalisation of Bradford & Bingley's mortgage book the press suggested that merging it with Northern Rock was a possibility. In October 2008 the chairman Ron Sandler noted that there had been informal talks concerning the idea of the merger with the government, but there had been no subsequent discussion. Sandler did however add "It would not surprise me at some point if a closer look was taken at the method of managing loan books within government-owned banks".
In March 2009 Alistair Darling said that he was keeping his options open during the "fast-moving" crisis in the banking industry, and thus not ruling out the possibility of a mortgage book merger between Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley.
On 24 March 2010 UKFI announced its intention to integrate Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc and Bradford & Bingley plc under a single holding company. On 1 October it was announced that Bradford & Bingley plc and Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc had been merged under a single holding company UK Asset Resolution Ltd.
Remutualisation proposals.
In September and October 2009 various groups of people, including the Building Societies Association, called for the Northern Rock to be remutualised. Treasury minister Sarah McCarthy-Fry said that the idea of mutualisation had not been ruled out. The Northern Rock Building Society had previously been de-mutualised in 1997, to become a bank.
In the Labour Party's 2010 Manifesto there was a mention of a possible "mutual solution" for Northern Rock. The Liberal Democrat's Manifesto noted that the party would have turned Northern Rock into a building society.
On 1 February it was reported that Yorkshire Building Society were interested in Northern Rock. It has also been reported that Nationwide Building Society are not interested in the bank. On 31 March 2011 the Coventry Building Society expressed an interest in remutualising Northern Rock as a part of Coventry.
Sale to Virgin Money.
During 2011 the government encouraged another round of bidding for the bank. By the first round deadline on 28 July Virgin Money and JC Flowers put forward their expressions of interest. In late October Virgin Money submitted their 2nd round bid for the bank. The following day NBNK rejoined the bidding process for the bank, leaving only NBNK and Virgin as contenders. This came as the restriction on NBNK from Hoffman's appointment expired; at this time NBNK were also preparing a bid for 632 branches of Lloyds. On 17 November 2011 it was announced that Virgin Money Holdings (UK) Limited were going to buy Northern Rock from UKFI for £747 million up front and other potential payments of up to £280 million over the next few years. These additional payments which would take the value of the sale to over £1 billion could include a £150 million capital instrument and an additional cash consideration of £50-80 million would be paid upon a future profitable IPO or sale in the next five years. A £73 million deferred consideration was paid by Virgin by July 2012.
The sale went through on 1 January 2012. The government said it had no plans to sell Northern Rock (Asset Management). There will be no further job losses for at least three years, except for the ones already announced previously. Virgin have also pledged to keep the headquarters of the new Virgin Money bank (savings and mortgages) in Newcastle upon Tyne. The deal is pending regulatory and EU merger approval, and the combined business will operate under the Virgin Money brand.
The deal with Virgin included jobs for 2,100 employees, around a million of Northern Rock's customers, 75 branches and around a £14bn mortgage book and a £16bn retail deposit book. Although the deal means that the British government are to lose hundreds of millions on the deal, they claim that this represented the best deal for the taxpayer. The purchase was funded by the Virgin Group and WL Ross & Co., and Virgin hope that the new enlarged Virgin Money with its 4 million customers will be "a significant new competitor in UK retail banking". WL Ross has a 44% stake in the enlarged Virgin Money - this is larger than his stake in Virgin Money after their purchase of Church House Trust in 2010.
The deals with the Northern Rock Foundation will be extended to at least 2013, giving Virgin and the Foundation time to agree how they will work together. The new Virgin Money also aims lend £45bn in total to support its customers over the next five years. The enlarged Virgin Money is led by Sir David Clementi, as Chairman, and Jayne-Anne Gadhia, as Chief Executive Officer.
The National Audit Office are to investigate the sale of the bank to Virgin.

Les Massiliades

Les Massiliades is a music festival created by the students of French engineering school École Centrale Marseille. It takes place each spring in the city of Marseille, in the south-east of France.
Purpose.
The main idea of the Massiliades is to highlight the diversity of today's music and to allow its audience to gain access to musical genres they didn't properly know, in the enjoyable context of Marseille's spring time.
2008.
On its first year, the Massiliades was set on Saturday, May 5 at the restaurant Le Nautica, in the eighth district of Marseille. All along the afternoon, the listeners heard the creations of six amateur student bands, while looking at the Mediterranean Sea from the restaurant's terrace. One of those bands was rewarded a studio recording session.
Around 10 PM, the French band SMOOF went on stage performing some kind of pop- and jazz-inspired reggae.
And then, after midnight, DJ's animated a student party.
2009.
The second edition of the Massiliades was held on April 7, 2009, in a concert hall renowned in Marseille, the Espace Julien.
This time, the concept of a booster for amateur student bands was abandoned, to improve the quality of the show, now consisting of professional bands, or bands that had already acquired a great experience, playing in other festivals or bars. Multiple musical genres were represented, including rock, rap, reggae, afrobeat, metal, folk, java and what the headline band Les Hurlements d'Léo calls "caravaning".
Concerts started at 7 p.m. on the great stage of the Espace Julien. The first three groups to perform that night were Milska, Rom Buddy Band and Solat', bands originated in southern French cities of Marseille and Montpellier.
The concert of Les Hurlements d'Léo, followed by Big Mama, started at 10 p.m.
Once the concerts were over, the night went on with the mixes of French DJ collective Marabout Fonk System.
2010.
The third edition was set to be held on March 27, 2010, at the same place, the Espace Julien concert hall.
The festival was to be headlined by the French band Debout sur le Zinc. Other acts performing this day were to include bands from Marseille, the electro-rock band RedLight and the ethno-jazz band Kabbalah, as well as, for the first time, a foreign band: pop-rock English act Crowne.

Catherine Linton

Catherine Linton (also known as "Young Catherine" or Cathy Linton and later as Catherine Heathcliff then as Catherine Earnshaw) is a character in Emily Brontë's novel "Wuthering Heights". She is the daughter of Edgar Linton and Catherine Earnshaw, and, despite Heathcliff's attempts at exacting revenge on her for the indiscretions of her family, she eventually marries her true love, Hareton Earnshaw, re-establishing long-lost equilibrium in the story.
Story.
It soon becomes apparent that Heathcliff's plans for their marriage form part of his endeavour for revenge on Edgar and his daughter: Cathy "will" marry Linton, be it against her will or not. Nelly finds the childish love letters and burns them. Linton's letters, it is implied, are so beautiful that they were most likely written by Heathcliff as a means of drawing Cathy to the Heights.
The relationship sinks after Nelly's discovery, but it later emerges, to Nelly's considerable horror, that Cathy has been making more visits to Wuthering Heights in their stead.
Edgar presently falls ill with distress, and Heathcliff keeps Cathy and Nelly at the Heights until Cathy finally agrees to marry Linton. Desperate to see her father once more before he dies, she consents, and her fate at Wuthering Heights is sealed. Edgar dies, kissing his daughter on the cheek, knowing that Thrushcross Grange, the Linton household, is now in the hands of his enemy.
Linton, who does not at all resemble his father, but is in almost every way like his mother, falls ill as well and dies shortly after his marriage. Heathcliff forces him in his dying moments to bequeath everything to him, nothing to Cathy. As a result, it seems that Cathy, now cold and distant because of her understandable misery, is yet another character destined for an unhappy ending.
Eventually, however, she and Hareton form an unlikely romance: after long having shrugged off his attempts at winning her affection, she begins to aid him in his education. Heathcliff sees the love between the two blossom and, probably because he has a grudging soft spot for Hareton, no longer takes pleasure in degrading them. Heathcliff begins to see Hareton as an adopted son, sharing a similar life of the poor stable boy robbed of his inheritance and love. He no longer stands between Hareton and Cathy, seeing it as now a pointless endeavour and essentially as revenge against himself, and the two are finally allowed to openly love each other.
Heathcliff dies and is buried next to the elder Catherine. Cathy and Hareton make plans to marry on New Year's Day, and to reside at Thrushcross Grange.
Description.
Although she is Catherine Earnshaw's daughter, she resembles her father more in looks, with golden ringlets and fair skin. The only qualities that she inherits from her mother are the beautiful "Earnshaw eyes" (which also belong to her future husband, Hareton Earnshaw) and her wayward, mischievous spirit. At first, Cathy is gentle and kind, but a bit snobbish because of her guarded and wealthy upbringing at the Grange, but, when reduced to a life of misery at the Heights, she grows cold, distant and dismissive of everyone around her. It is her romance with Hareton that re-establishes her bubbly personality.

History.
The origin of Bermúdez goes back to 1852, eight years after the declaration of independence and foundation of the Dominican Republic, when Don Erasmo Bermúdez created the formula of the Bitter Panacea, a rum to be taken as appetizing that soon became famous.
Until 1927 the entity was ruled by Don Armando Bermúdez, who turned it into an industry of national projection under the name of "Unrivaled Liquors Manufacture". Later, when it turned into a stock company under the present name of J. Armando Bermúdez & Co., C. por A. reached its character of national institution under the ruling of Domingo O. Bermúdez.
The fourth generation of managers arrived in 1967, presently represented by Don Carlos Alberto Bermúdez Pippa, who runs the company under the same industrial, commercial and of service principles left by their founders.

Fast Fourier Transform Telescope

Fast Fourier Transform Telescope is Tegmark and Zaldarriaga's name for a design for an all-digital synthetic-aperture telescope. It is a type of interferometer designed to be cheaper than standard telescope interferometers currently in use.
In 1868, Hippolyte Fizeau realized that the lenses and mirrors in a telescope perform a physical approximation of a Fourier transform. He noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array — a technique which later became known as astronomical interferometry. See History of astronomical interferometry.
In a 2008 paper, Tegmark and Zaldarriaga proposed a telescope design that dispenses altogether with the lenses and mirrors, relying instead on computers fast enough to perform all the necessary transforms. The concept is an all-digital telescope with an antenna consisting of a rectangular grid. Building radio telescopes this way should become feasible within a few years if Moore's law continues to hold. Eventually optical telescopes could also be built this way. This technique is already being used in radar applications.
This paper refers to an earlier telescope design from 1993 which took direct images of the Crab nebula at radio wavelengths using an eight-by-eight-pixel two-dimensional spatial FFT processor.

Stay Alive (game)

Stay Alive is a strategy game, where players try to keep their marbles from falling through holes in the game board while trying to make their opponents marbles fall through. It was originally published by Milton Bradley in 1971 and was recently republished with a smaller board by Winning Moves Games USA in 2005.
Gameplay.
Each player starts the game with a number of marbles in their own color. Players adjust the slides on the board randomly to create a starting board. Starting with a randomly chosen player, players take turns placing their marbles onto the board until all marbles are placed. The start player then chooses a slider and moves it one click either towards or away from the board. Each slider has holes in different locations in it and, as each is moved, the holes can align and allow marbles to fall through. The next player then chooses a slide and moves it, with the one rule that he cannot choose the same slide as the player before him did. If a player's last marble falls, they are out of the game. The last player with a marble on the board is the winner.

George Stradling

George Stradling (1620 or 1621 – 19 April 1688) was Dean of Chichester Cathedral from 1672 until his death.
Life.
Stradling was born at St Donat's Castle, Wales to Sir John Stradling, Baronet and travelled to France and Italy before studying at the University of Oxford. He entered Jesus College, Oxford in 1638 when he was 17 years old and obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1640. He was noted as a talented lutinist. In 1641, he was made a Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, where Gilbert Sheldon was Warden, and he later obtained his Master of Arts (1647) and Doctor of Divinity (1661) degrees. He was also a Fellow of Jesus College from 1641 to 1642. He fought on the Royalist side during the English Civil War as a cornet of horse in his brother's regument. He returned to Oxford when the fighting was over, and survived the threat of ejection by the Parliamentary Visitors in control of the university with the help of Edmund Ludlow, a prominent Parliamentarian and his nephew by marriage.
He was ordained deacon and priest by the Bishop of Oxford, Robert Skinner, on 7 November 1660 and became Sheldon's chaplain in London (Sheldon having become Bishop of London by this time) rather than become Principal of Jesus College. With Sheldon's influence, Stradling was able to obtain many benefices, which he held at the same time (as a pluralist). He held positions, at one time or another, at parishes in Fulham and St Bride's Church, Fleet Street (London), Hanwell (Middlesex), Cliffe-at-Hoo and Sutton-at-Hone (Kent). He was also canon of St Paul's Cathedral and of Westminster Abbey: appointed to both in 1660, he was still holding this posts when he died. In 1671, he became precentor of Chichester Cathedral and was made dean in 1672, again holding both posts until his death. Despite being a pluralist, Stradling presided at meetings of the cathedral chapter at least once in every year and also helped to repair and improve the cathedral after the effects of the Civil War. However, he clashed with the Bishop of Chichester, Guy Carleton, who regarded Stradling as lukewarm and indifferent. Stradling died on 19 April 1688 and was buried at Westminster Abbey. He published one sermon during his lifetime, with others being published after his death.

The Johns Hopkins Science Review

The Johns Hopkins Science Review is a US television series about science that was produced at Johns Hopkins University from 1948-1955. Starting in 1950, the series aired on the DuMont Television Network until the network's demise in 1955. The series' creator was Lynn Poole, who wrote or co-wrote most of its episodes and acted as the on-camera host. In 2002, Patrick Lucanio and Gary Coville wrote that, "In retrospect, Lynn Poole created one of those unique series that allowed television to fulfill its idealized mission as both an educational and an entertainment medium."
The original series was followed by three related series produced by Poole at Johns Hopkins University: "Tomorrow" (1955), "Tomorrow's Careers" (1955-1956), and "Johns Hopkins File 7" (1956-1960). Johns Hopkins University ended its production of television series in 1960.
Broadcast history.
The original series aired from March 9, 1948 to March 6, 1955. Initially, the show was broadcast only in the Baltimore area. Starting with the December 17, 1948 episode, shows were broadcast by CBS from stations along the east coast.
As was typical in the early days of television broadcasting, each show was broadcast live from a studio at Johns Hopkins University. Each week's show involved one or more guests, often from the Johns Hopkins faculty and staff. Poole acted as the host and interviewer. The guest might show how a scientific apparatus such an electron microscope or an oscilloscope worked, or would briefly explain scientific ideas to the viewers. In the December 5, 1950 episode, the live broadcast of a fluoroscope screen was used by doctors in New York and Chicago to diagnose the injuries to a machinist in the hospital in Baltimore. In the April 21, 1952 episode, a scientist drank a solution containing the radioactive isotope of iodine, and then followed its progress in his own body with a Geiger counter. The guests were sometimes national figures like Wernher von Braun (October 20, 1952), George Gamov, and Harold Urey. The show famously showed a live birth and gave instructions to women viewers about breast self-examination.
Each half-hour episode was broadcast from WAAM in Baltimore. The series moved to the DuMont Television Network in November 1949 through station WMAR. The program aired Tuesdays at 8:30 pm EST during the 1950-51 season, Mondays at 8:30pm EST during the 1951-52 season, and Wednesdays at 8pm EST during the 1952-53 season. According to the 1953-54 United States network television schedule, the show remained in the Wednesday at 8pm EST slot for the 1953-54 season.
The series would win the network Peabody Awards in 1950 (honorable mention) and 1952.
A spin-off program, "Johns Hopkins File 7", aired on a syndicated basis from 1956 to 1960. Like the "Review", "File 7" was broadcast by WAAM and featured host Lynn Poole.
Archives.
Approximately 303 episodes of the original series were made. There are records of 238 episodes, and kinescope films from 186 episodes, stored in Special Collections of the Milton Eisenhower Library at Johns Hopkins University. This means it has the most surviving episodes of any DuMont Network program. The earliest surviving kinescope is from November 21, 1950. At least three episodes survive at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.
In addition, Johns Hopkins University has records and films of the three successor series.

Animal Mechanicals

Animal Mechanicals is a Decode Entertainment television series created by Jeff Rosen and produced by Halifax Film, a DHX Media Company, in association with CBC.
Characters.
Rex.
Rex is a green dinosaur. His enhanced ability is mechana-strong. Often, when utilizing this ability, Unicorn refers to him as being "strong like a titanium Tyrannosaurus" which, along with his name and bipedal shape, would indicate that he is a robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex. He is the leader of the animal mechanicals when they are on their journey to their mission. When he transforms, he becomes a cross between a forklift, a tractor, and a digger. He is voiced by Jim Fowler.
Unicorn.
Unicorn is a pink unicorn with the ability to fly. She is the only Animal Mechanical who cannot walk on two legs. The horn on her head can be made to blink like a beacon, allowing other creatures to follow her while she is flying. When flying, her legs are bent backwards and her hooves become rocket boosters, propelling her through the air. Her wings are folded inside her back, except when in use where they provide direction and speed control. Unicorn can also throw lightning, and create a whirlwind with her horn. She is voiced by Leah Ostry.
Komodo.
Komodo is a red Komodo Dragon who walks on two legs and has big, squared-off blue spectacles. His enhancement is the ability to change his tail into a selection of tools, such as a hammer or a screwdriver. Often, when utilizing this ability, Unicorn refers to him as being "handy dandy tool time." This does, however, involve him working backwards to the line of the problem, forcing him to bend almost in half in order to see what he is doing. He is shown to be very intelligent, often figuring out the small details of the problem in hand. He tends to act like a martial arts expert. In a few episodes, he reveals that he has a sensitive stomach and legs. He often has to warn Sasquatch about "traps". He is voiced by Shannon Lynch.
Sasquatch.
Sasquatch is a blue sasquatch who has the enhanced ability to stretch. Each of his limbs extend to an incredible length. When stretched his individual limbs are long, however his joints do not alter and bend as normal. In the episode, "Baboon Balloon Island", it was revealed that he is allergic to air pears and in "Dino Mountain Island" and "Mechana Ski Ball Island",he has anxiety and a fear of heights. He has referred to himself many times as "The Mighty Sasquatch". Whenever Mouse is scared,he always comes to hold her hand (as seen in Jigsaw Shark Puzzle and Chugboat Island), but whenever he's scared or impatient (as seen in Dino Mountain Island and Snail Pace Island), Mouse always comes to hold his hand. He is voiced by Ian MacDougall.
Mouse.
Mouse is a yellow mouse who is the youngest in the group and runs about on two wheels instead of her back feet. Her ability is mechana-fast, which is increased by lying flat, with her front paws on the ground, which also have wheels on them, and flattening her ears to the side of her head and extending exhaust pipes which help to propel her forwards. Her ears act like satellite dishes to catch sounds. She sometimes giggles before Sasquatch transforms and can fit to tight places her friends can't. Whenever Sasquatch is afraid or impatient,she always come to hold his hand. But when she is scared, Sasquatch is always there to hold her hand. She also has the ability to understand creatures. She is voiced by Abigail Gordon .
Island Owl.
Island Owl only appears at the start of each episode, giving the animal mechanicals their mission. Her head resembles a television set, which starts each briefing showing her face, then changes to show a representation of the island to which the animal mechanicals are to be sent. She does not accompany the animal mechanicals, nor after they have left to go on their mission is she heard from or seen again; however she is mentioned by Komodo whenever someone breaks a rule. She is voiced by Lenore Zann.

<doc id="19689069" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19689069" title="Skolfield-Whittier House">
Skolfield-Whittier House

The Skolfields.
The Skolfield-Whittier House is one half of an Italiante-style duplex built between 1858 and 1862 for the sons of wealthy shipbuilder Master George Skolfield (1780–1866). Captain Alfred Skolfield (1815–1895) owned the side that is now known as the Skolfield-Whitter House, splitting the construction cost of $15,751.96 with his brother Captain Samuel Skolfield (1826–1916), who owned and lived in the other side of the building (now used as the Pejepscot Historical Society headquarters).
In 1862 Alfred, his wife Martha Harward (1836–1904), and their young daughter Eugenie (1860–1951) moved into their new home. The family furnished the home with expensive furniture from Portland's Walter Corey Company, choosing a Rococo Revival style (much of this furniture remains in the home today). Several of the rooms also feature marble fireplaces with encaustic tile and stylish curtains. At this time the home was most likely lit by gaslight. In 1864 Martha gave birth to a second daughter, Augusta Marie (1864–1902).
Move to England.
In 1867, for reasons that are not entirely clear, Alfred moved his family to Liverpool, England. It may be that political tensions developing during the Reconstruction era were the motivation for the move, as the Skolfields were staunch Democrats living in a region that was primarily Republican. After relocating to England, they did not sell their Brunswick home, choosing instead to rent it out to several different people during their absence. In 1868 Professor J.B. Sewall moved into the home, followed by Stephen O. Purington (1880–1882) and finally Dr. Mitchell (1883–1885), who in 1885 purchased the house next door and became the Skolfields' neighbor.
Return to Brunswick and renovation of home.
In 1885, after living abroad for 18 years, the Skolfields returned to their home and almost immediately began renovations. The plumbing was updated and the former carriage house renovated and attached to the rest of the building. The new space served to house the relocated kitchen, informal dining room, and laundry room. The former kitchen was converted and expanded to become a formal dining room, and the old dining room was renovated into a drawing room.
The influence of English style upon the Skolfields is apparent in the renovations made to the house at this time. The family purchased many new decorations for the home in England, including carpets, a piano, a Chippendale wall bracket and several paintings by J.B. Smith, Spinks, Enser and Woolett. The Skolfields also updated their furniture by purchasing many pieces in the popular Eastlake style. English influence led the Skolfields to separate the bathtub and toilet added to the former carriage house into two separate rooms. In 1891, the home was wired for electricity and circa 1894–1895, the home was connected to the new town sewer lines.
The Whittiers.
Alfred Skolfield died on June 1, 1895, but a new patriarch in the home would soon take his place. On June 24, Eugenie married Frank Whittier (1861–1924) in the drawing room, the most formal room of the house. Frank, a Phi Beta Kappa Bowdoin College graduate from Farmington, Maine, received his medical degree in 1889 and was appointed professor of Pathology and Bacteriology at the Maine Medical School (a now-defunct school of Bowdoin College) in 1891. Frank was Maine's first forensic pathologist, and also took on responsibilities as the first medical examiner for Cumberland County, Brunswick milk inspector, and chairman of the Maine Medical Association's committee on venereal diseases. He appears to have been the first to use a serology test (to distinguish human blood from that of other animals) in a court of law, as well as the first to develop a test for ballistic fingerprinting.
Frank and Eugenie made few changes to the home. Frank added a grandfather clock (believed to have been a Whittier family heirloom) to the entrance hall, and circa 1910–1912 the couple moved their master bedroom to the former carriage house. The former master bedroom was converted into the current library. By 1913, a telephone had been installed in the home.
Eugenie and Frank had three daughters: Isabel (1896–1976), Alice (1898–1994) and Charlotte (1903–1912). Charlotte died at the age of 9 after accidentally catching on fire in the family kitchen. Isabel and Alice both attended Bryn Mawr College, graduating in 1920 and 1921, respectively. Isabel became a teacher at Brooklyn College, where she taught for more than 30 years, and was a close friend of Margaret Chase Smith (there are many pictures of Smith scattered about the home). Meanwhile, Alice followed in her father's footsteps, setting up a practice in Portland to become Maine's first female pediatrician.
After Frank's death in 1924, Eugenie took up a life of travel, and she and her daughters usually spent only summers at their Brunswick home. In 1982, Alice, the last living member of the family, donated the entire home and its contents to the Pejepscot Historical Society. The museum is open for guided tours during the summer season.

Treaty of Tippecanoe

The Treaty of Tippecanoe was an agreement between the United States government and Native American Potawatomi tribes in Indiana on October 26, 1832.
Treaty.
On October 26, 1832, the United States government entered negotiations with the Native American tribes of north-western Indiana seeking to purchase their land for white settlement. The United States was represented by three commissioners, former Governor of Indiana Jonathan Jennings, John Wesley Davis and Marks Crume. The United States had already purchased the Miami claim to the region in a previous treaty, and the Pottawatomie were the only natives who still held a claim in the region. The land purchased was most of the northwestern part of the state of Indiana. It was recorded in the treaty as:
beginning at a point on Lake Michigan, where the line dividing the States of Indiana and Illinois intersects the saline thence with the margin of said Lake, to the intersection of the southern boundary of a cession made by the Pottawatomie, at the treaty of the Wabash, of eighteen hundred and twenty-six; thence east, to the northwest corner of the cession made by the treaty of St. Joseph's, in eighteen hundred and twenty-eight; thence south ten miles; thence with the Indian boundary line to the Michigan road; thence south with said road to the northern boundary line, air designated in the treaty of eighteen hundred and twenty-six, with the Pottawatomie; thence west with the Indian boundary line to the river Tippecanoe; thence with the Indian boundary line, as established by the treaty of eighteen hundred and eighteen, at St. Mary's to the line dividing the States of Indiana and Illinois; and thence north, with the line dividing the said States, to the place of beginning.
The treaty provided for establishing a reserve for the Pottawatomie along the Yellow River, and to build a mill for them on that reservation. In exchange for the land, the Potawatomi tribe was granted an annual payment of $20,000 (USD) for a term of twenty years. Upon signing the treaty, the tribe was also granted $100,000 in goods, and a lump sum payment of $62,412 for payment of debts owed by the Potawatomi. The government also offered the tribes assistance in moving to new lands in Indian Territory, and providing farming implements to assist them in cultivating the land they would move to.
The native tribes agreed, and the following tribal leaders signed the treaty with an X mark: Louison, Che-ehaw-eose, Banack, Man-o-quett, Kin-kosh, Pee-shee-Nvaw-no, Menominee, Mis-sah-kaw-way, Kee-waw-nay, Sen-bo-go, Che-quaw-ma-eaw-co, Muak-kose, Ah-you-way, Po-kah-kause, So-po tie, Newark, Che-man, No-taw-kah, Nas-waw-kee, Pec-pin-a-paw, Ma-ehe-saw, O-kitch-ehee, Pee-pish-kah, conl-mo-yo, Chiek-kose, Mis-qua buck, Mo-tie-ah, Muck-ka-tah-mo-tvay, Mah-qusw-shee, O-sheh-weh, Mah-zick, Queh-kah-pah, Quash-quaw, Louisor Perish, Pam-bo-go, Bee-ya w-yo, Pah-ciss, Mauck-eo-pavv-waw, Mis-sah-qua, Kawk, Miee-kiss, Shaw-bo, Aub-be-naub-bee, Mau-maut-wah, O-ka-mause, Pash-ee-po, We-wiss-lai, Ash-kom, andWaw-zee-o-nes.

Uncle B

Uncle B was the debut album released by N-Dubz. The album is dedicated to former N-Dubz manager and father of Dappy, Byron Contostavlos, who died shortly before the band were signed to their second record label All Around the World. It entered the official UK Albums Chart at number 11. On January 6, 2009, it was announced on the official All Around the World website that the album had gone platinum. Seven singles have been released from the album, with the first three being released by LRC, and the last four being released by All Around the World. The album was not released until in 2008, despite recording starting in 2006. This was due to the group changing record label from LRC to All Around the World.
Singles.
"You Better Not Waste My Time" was released as the album's debut single, on LRC Records. The song was released as a digital download, peaking at #141 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was released physically by Polydor, in a joint deal with All Around The World, in September 2007, peaking at #96. "I Swear" was released as the album's second single, on LRC Records. The song was released both physically and digitally, peaking at #91 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was also released in the United States, becoming their only single ever to do so. "Feva Las Vegas" was released as the album's third single, on LRC Records. The song was released both physically and digitally, peaking at #57 on the UK Singles Chart. "Ouch" was released as the album's fourth single, on All Around The World Records. The song peaked at #22 on the UK Singles Chart, despite being widely available for over two months before its official release. "Papa Can You Hear Me?" was released as the album's fifth single, on All Around The World Records. The song peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the group's first top 20 hit. "Strong Again" was released as the album's sixth single, on All Around The World Records. The song peaked at #24 on the UK Singles Chart, despite being one of their highest played hits, and their first to reach the A-List Radio 1 Playlist. "Wouldn't You" was released as the album's seventh and final single, on All Around The World Records. The song peaked at #64 on the UK Singles Chart, despite being a fan-favourite and reaching the B-List Radio 1 Playlist.
Promotional Music Videos.
Music videos were made for four non-singles from the album - "N-Dubz vs. NAA", "Defeat You", "Sex" and "Love For My Slum". "N-Dubz vs. NAA" appeared as the b-side to "Feva Las Vegas", and a music video was subsequently recorded in promotion for the single. "Defeat You" was originally intended to be released a single, however, the release was cancelled in favour of "Papa (Can U Hear Me)", however, a music video was subsequently recorded before the release was cancelled. Chipmunk is featured in the video. A music video for "Sex" was recorded in promotion of a new version of the track being used in an episode of Channel 4's Shameless. The new version features an extended intro, verses by Tulisa & Fazer, and an extended outro. A music video for "Love For My Slum" was recorded to the song's popularity amongst fans.
Reception.
Uncle B has received mixed reviews from critics. "Orange" gave the album a mixed review: Slickly produced hip-hop, grime and r'n'b form the backdrop to Tulisa's better-than-most vocals and the whimsical rhymeplay of Fazer and Dappy, who touch on everything from cheating ('Ouch'), "fake" MCs ('Defeat You') to fornication. "I don't mean to be pushy, pushy/I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy," snarls Dappy on the shameless 'Sex', which deserves a government warning in its own right. Still, they're not as mean as the So Solid Crew of yesteryear, nor as good, and their faux bravado is just what you'd expect from these poster kids for urban Britannia. Parents won't be too impressed, mind you, but Uncle B will likely be lauded for its furious party jams made with the Skins generation of reckless teens in mind. All that, and it's actually quite a good listen. "The Guardian" also gave the album a mixed review.

On 13 January 2011, Linganzi signed for Preston North End on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season.

In March, Brown said Linganzi still had a role in the first team, having been out for two months.
At the start of the 2011–12 season, Linganzi played in a pre-season friendly for Preston North End against Morecambe, prompting speculation that another loan deal had been agreed.

Hareton Earnshaw

Hareton Earnshaw is a character in Emily Brontë's novel "Wuthering Heights". He is the son of Hindley Earnshaw and Hindley's wife Frances. At the end of the novel, he makes plans to wed Catherine Linton, with whom he falls in love.
Story.
Frances dies shortly after giving birth in June 1778 to Hareton, which results in Hindley's descent into a life of anguish and inebriety, so Hareton is cared for and nursed by Nelly Dean, the primary narrator of the story. When Nelly leaves to reside at Thrushcross Grange with Catherine Earnshaw and Edgar Linton, Heathcliff seeks revenge on Hindley and gains control of Wuthering Heights. Hindley dies shortly after the decease of Catherine Earnshaw, and Heathcliff sets out to treat Hareton as cruelly and unjustly as Hindley treated him: he reduces Hareton to servant-boy status at the Heights. Nevertheless, Heathcliff's impulsive paternal instincts towards Hareton are revealed when, during one fraught episode in which Hindley's alcoholism takes him too far, he saves the infant from a potentially fatal fall from the top of the Heights' staircase.
Because of the dark, savage environment in which he grows up, the boy becomes an ignorant, dirty and uneducated man, unable to read or write. When Cathy Linton comes to Wuthering Heights sixteen years later, Hareton has not changed, but it is apparent that he sees Heathcliff as his own father and loves him dearly. Heathcliff has a secret regard for Hareton as well, but he wishes him to feel the same pain that he himself experienced in childhood. Hareton forms an attraction to Cathy, but she dismisses it with disgust, insisting that he is a mindless, rude beast of a man. This only continues after Cathy's husband, Linton Heathcliff, dies, and Cathy becomes accustomed to the terror of Wuthering Heights. She grows just as rude and cold as its inhabitants, and, whenever Hareton expresses any amount of regard or tenderness towards her, she spurns it.
Cathy and Hareton's relationship changes when, eventually, Cathy decides to help him with his secret self-education by teaching him how to read and talk properly. At first Hareton is uneasy about this, suspecting some patronising trickery, but it soon comes to be that the two fall in love. Heathcliff thus allows his emotions to take him over, and, because of his secret regard for Hareton (who in many ways resembles him), his sudden indifference about his enemies' destruction and his increasingly overwhelming desire to be with his soul mate Catherine Earnshaw, he lets the two continue their romance. Hareton is deeply hurt by his subsequent death, because he views Heathcliff as his true father. He kisses his corpse relentlessly, digging the grave with tears spilling down his cheeks. As Nelly points out ironically, "poor Hareton, the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much" for Heathcliff's demise:
He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.
At the close of "Wuthering Heights", Cathy and Hareton plan to live in Thrushcross Grange and marry on New Year's Day, adding a sense of the happy ending to an otherwise dark story.
Description.
Hareton is a broad-shouldered, strong man, with dark hair. Isabella Linton says that he has "a look of Catherine in his eyes", and indeed he and Cathy Linton both have the dark brown "Earnshaw eyes". He seems to carry Heathcliff's spirit, and the two have a strange regard for one another, in spite of the fact that Heathcliff has completely ruined his life. Heathcliff also sees Catherine Earnshaw in him, which would appear to make Hareton a source of pain. He sometimes tries to get along with Linton (Heathcliff's son), but didn't get well. His romance with Cathy Linton may partly explain why Heathcliff finally ends his life, potentially at peace, without taking any further revenge on anyone.

Pleasant Grove City v. Summum

Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, , is a legal case in which the United States Supreme Court considered whether the municipality of Pleasant Grove, Utah, which allows privately donated monuments, including one of the Ten Commandments, to be displayed on public property, must also let the Summum church put up its own statue, similar in size to the one of the ten commandments. Some court-watchers, including the New York Times editorial board, believe the Court should rule that the United States Constitution does not allow government to favor one religion over another.
Arguing for the petitioner (the City of Pleasant Grove) was Jay Alan Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), and for the Summum, attorney Pamela Harris of the firm O’Melveny & Myers. The ACLJ was expected to argue that there should be a distinction between government speech and private speech and though the government should have the right to display the 10 Commandments, it should not have to endorse all private speech.
Holding.
On February 25, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Summum in the Pleasant Grove case. Justice Samuel Alito, in his opinion for the court, explained that a municipality's acceptance and acquisition of a privately funded permanent monument erected in a public park while refusing to accept other privately funded permanent memorials is a valid expression of governmental speech, which is permissible and not an unconstitutional interference with the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. According to Alito, "the display of a permanent monument in a public park" is perceived by an ordinary and reasonable observer to be an expression of values and ideas of the government, the owner of the park and the monument, even though the particular idea expressed by the monument is left to the interpretation of the individual observer. Alito made a clear distinction between forms of private speech in public parks, such as rallies and temporary holiday displays (Christmas trees and menorahs), and the government speech represented by permanent monuments. He opined that even long winded speakers eventually go home with their leaflets and holiday displays are taken down; but, permanent monuments endure and are obviously associated with their owners. Alito wrote, "cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments." While Summum attempted to persuade the Court that preventing governments from selecting monuments on the basis of content would be tenable, Justice Alito noted that such a situation could put government in the position of accepting permanent monuments with conflicting messages, that do not represent the values and ideals of the community, or removing all monuments from public space. Alito also questioned whether, if the law followed the view expressed by Summum, New York City would have been required to accept a Statue of Autocracy from the German Empire or Imperial Russia when it accepted the Statue of Liberty from France.

<doc id="19689723" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19689723" title="Mexican nationality law">
Mexican nationality law

The Mexican nationality law is in the 30th article of the Constitution of Mexico and another law, as provided by the 32nd article about the exercise of the rights given by Mexican legislation to those Mexicans that also possess another nationality and to establish the norms to avoid the conflicts generated by the use of double nationality. This law was last modified in 2005. 
In general terms, Mexican nationality is based on both the principle of "jus soli" and the principle of "jus sanguinis". The Mexican constitution also makes a distinction between nationals of Mexico and citizens of Mexico.
Acquisition of nationality.
According to the 30th article of the Constitution of Mexico, there are two ways in which a person can acquire the Mexican nationality, by birth and by naturalization.
Nationality by birth.
The constitution declares that Mexicans by birth (born Mexicans) include the following:
Nationality by naturalization.
Mexicans by naturalization are the following:
The Nationality Law establishes also that a foreigner that wishes to naturalize must do the following:
Possession of Mexican nationality.
Mexican nationality entails several obligations set forth in the 31st article of the Constitution, namely:
Documents that serve as proof of nationality are the following:
Mexican citizenship.
As in most other Central and South American countries, Mexican law differentiates between nationality and citizenship. Nationality is the attribute of the person in international law that describes their relationship to the State, whereas citizenship is given to those nationals (those who hold Mexican nationality) that have certain rights and responsibilities before the State. The 34th article of the Mexican constitution establishes that Mexican citizens are those Mexican who are 18 years of age or older, and who have an "honest way of living". Mexican citizens have these rights:
Mexican law also distinguishes between naturalized citizens and natural-born citizens in many ways. Under the Mexican constitution, naturalized citizens are prohibited from serving in a wide array of positions, mostly governmental. Naturalized Mexicans cannot occupy any of following posts:
Loss of nationality and loss of citizenship.
The 37th article of the constitution establishes that Mexicans by birth (natural born Mexicans) can never be deprived of their nationality, as defined in the Nationality law, in the acquisition of another nationality. However, "naturalized" Mexicans may lose their nationality by doing the following:
Even though Mexican nationals by birth may never lose their nationality, Mexican citizenship, and thus its prerogatives, may be lost if a person does the following:
Multiple nationality.
The Mexican nationality law acknowledges that a Mexican by birth may possess another nationality. If that is the case, however, such an individual must always enter and leave the country as a Mexican (by presenting a Mexican proof of citizenship). The law also established that regardless of possession of another nationality, an individual will always be considered a Mexican national and or cannot claim protection from a foreign country in certain cases:
All Mexican nationals by birth who possess another nationality cannot be elected for or work in public office only in those cases that the law clearly establishes that they must not acquire another nationality. If in such a case, she or he can request a Certificate of Nationality from the government, renouncing the other nationality.

The Way of a Trout with the Fly

The Way of a Trout with the Fly and Some Further Studies in Minor Tactics is a fly fishing book written by G. E. M. Skues published in London in 1921. This was Skues's second book after "Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream (1910)."
Synopsis.
"The of Way of a Trout" was originally intended to be a treatise on the theory and practice of dressing trout flies but, by Skues's own admission, does not do a very good job of it. The book does include a number of original and interesting chapters on fly dressing and Skues's theories on the vision of trout. Additionally, the "Minor Tactics" section expands on Skues's exploration of nymph fishing for trout.
Reviews.
This is a classic and I often wonder if Skues knew it would be when he set pen to paper. The book is inspirational in a way that Halford's work never was and grips the reader's attention right from the cover, which in the first edition bears the words: ...
"The Way of a Trout" shows Skues at the height of his powers and it contains the best of his thinking on fishing nymphs and semi-submerged patterns, illustrated by the sort of asides, stories and vast fund of experience that only he could call upon.
His second book, which many still regard as a masterpiece, was "The Way of a Trout with the Fly" (1921), and it quickly established him as one of the day's great angling theorists--as it also established the intellectual and ethical basis for sunken flies as legitimate tooks of a well-rounded angler.

Domenico Corri

Domenico Corri (October 4, 1746 - May 22, 1825) was an Italian composer, impresario, music publisher, and voice teacher.
Corri was born in Rome and studied voice with Nicola Porpora in Naples. In 1781 he moved to Scotland with his family to become an opera conductor. He became an important singing master in Edinburgh. Both his wife and daughter (Sophia Giustina Corri), who was a talented singer and pianist, were pupils of his. He was manager of the Theatre Royal in Edinburgh, and also conducted the concerts of the Musical Society there. However, his attempt to start an opera company in Edinburgh wasn't a success.
Around 1790 Corri moved to London and began publishing vocal music in Soho. Corri had financial problems on several occasions. With James Sutherland and his son John Corri he founded a publishing business. When Sutherland died in 1790 the company ceased to exist. His son-in-law Jan Ladislav Dussek joined the company in 1794. When the company of Dussek and Corri went bankrupt, Dussek left England for Germany, leaving behind his family, and his father-in-law (Corri) apparently in a debtor's jail. The business was later taken over in 1804 by his son Philippe Corri. An apprentice to Corri in London was Isaac Nathan.
Domenico Corri was also the manager of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in London. In 1812 Corri organised a concert in the Argyll Rooms in Regent Street, London. In this, the favorite concert hall in London at this time, Corri put together quite a contrasting program as the evening's entertainment: Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's "Stabat Mater" combined with a Ball. He died in London, aged 78.
Figured bass was, at this time, in decline and Corri invented a new system of accompaniments. Examples can be seen in "A select Collection of the most admired songs, duetts etc."
Three of his children were musicians: Sophia Giustina Corri (1775–1831), who later used the name Sophia Corri Dussek, Philippe Corri (1784–1849), who later immigrated to Baltimore, MD using the name Arthur Clifton, and Haydn Corri (1785–1860). His brother Natale Corri was also a composer and his niece, Fanny Corri-Paltoni, was a successful soprano.

Isabella Linton

Isabella Linton is a fictional character in Emily Brontë's novel "Wuthering Heights". She is the sister of Edgar Linton and the wife of Heathcliff.
Story.
Isabella Linton was raised in the safe, elegant environment of Thrushcross Grange, with her brother, Edgar. When Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights suffers an accident while intruding on the Grange, the Lintons take her in and make her a lady in five weeks. Both Edgar and Isabella grow close to Catherine, and, when she marries Edgar six years later, Isabella and Catherine identify as sisters and close friends.
When Heathcliff returns to the neighbourhood to exact revenge on the Lintons for Edgar's marriage with his true love Catherine, Isabella is irresistibly attracted to him. Catherine is deeply shocked by this, and playfully tells Heathcliff, enabling him to see a route to vengeance. Isabella, hurt by Catherine's betrayal, grows cold and distant to everyone around her, and, with everyone opposing a relationship with Heathcliff, "moped around in the garden" in great distress. Even more nervous is Edgar, who is suspicious of Heathcliff's mysterious return to the neighbourhood, but does not know what to do about it. It becomes apparent that Heathcliff is seducing Isabella when he "embraces her", much to Catherine's dislike. In explanation, Heathcliff reveals to her that he "will have his vengeance", and that he does not love Isabella: if Catherine wished him to marry her, he "would cut his throat."
One night, it is revealed to Nelly Dean, a servant at Wuthering Heights and the primary narrator of the novel, that Isabella has run off with Heathcliff, although Edgar has warned her that, if she does so, he will cut off all ties with her. After several months, Heathcliff and Isabella marry, but she soon realises her mistake, sending a long letter to Nelly in which she details her hostile and displeasing "welcome" at the Heights, and her hatred for Heathcliff, who has made it clear that he has married her only because he is now the heir to the Grange. Isabella is reduced to the status of the abused, hurt and degraded wife, and Nelly describes Heathcliff as looking like "the only one decent" in the household, while Isabella has seemingly lost the title of Miss Linton of Thrushcross Grange.
Isabella grows to despise her vengeful, tyrannical husband, and, at the death of Catherine, taunts him by insisting that her death was entirely his fault. She also points out that Hindley Earnshaw, Catherine's brother and Heathcliff's greatest enemy, has the same eyes as her, despite Heathcliff's relentless attempts to "gouge them out". This provokes Heathcliff to a deep and passionate anger, which results in yet another brawl between himself and Hindley. Seeing it as a chance to flee, Isabella escapes Wuthering Heights and her disastrous, terrifying marriage once and for all. She describes the occurrence thus:
The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then, quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.
After informing Nelly of how she pursued her escape, and paying one last visit to Thrushcross Grange, her childhood home, Isabella removes somewhere "south of London", where she gives birth to Heathcliff's son, Linton, who resembles Isabella in every aspect. The two lead a peaceful life for thirteen years, although no detail is given as to their activities. Edgar visits Isabella in her final illness, where she asks him to take charge of Linton, and raise him away from his father.
Description.
Isabella inherits the blonde hair, blue eyes and pale skin of the Linton family. Her son, Linton Heathcliff, also inherits these features. She is very sensitive, yet a bit shallow, and, in the words of Nelly, "has a capacity for strong attachments", shown in her falling hopelessly in love with Heathcliff, who in turn takes advantage of her blind affections and traps her in a tormenting marriage.

Alla barnen

"Alla barnen" (Swedish for "All the children") is a type of humorous poetic form, told primarily by schoolchildren in Swedish although it originated in Denmark. This meme was most popular in the early 1990s, as they were very macabre which at the time was highly unusual but their popularity has since diminished. The comic book writing duo Måns Gahrton and Johan Unenge has created several books based on this form, all with a title starting with "Alla barnen", the later ones in the series have discarded the more macabre jokes to be more child-friendly.
Form.
Compared to a limerick Alla Barnen is more free form with no set meter. They consist of three parts and these are:

Bahnbetriebswerk (steam locomotives)

A Bahnbetriebswerk (also abbreviated to Betriebswerk, Bw or BW) is the German term for a depot where the maintenance of railway locomotives and other rolling stock is carried out. It is roughly equivalent to a locomotive shed, running shed or motive power depot. These were of great importance during the steam locomotive era to ensure the smooth running of locomotive-hauled services. "Bahnbetriebswerke" had a large number of facilities in order to be able to carry out their various maintenance tasks. As a result they needed a lot of staff and were often the largest employers in the area. 
"The history and present-day importance of such depots is covered in the "Bahnbetriebswerk" article."
__TOC__
Functions.
Preparation of engines.
Before a steam locomotive was allowed onto the line, the crew had to carry out a large number of preparatory jobs. In accordance with the enginemen roster, the locomotive crew – engine driver and fireman – reported to the running foreman of the "Betriebswerk" in question. There they were given the key to their locomotive, a repair book, a route plan and timetable and a list of the trackworks en route. After completing all the formalities, the engine driver and fireman went to their engine, which was either berthed in the locomotive shed or stabled on a siding. After climbing into the driver's cab, the engine driver began with the most important checks: regulator, valve seals, water levels and a brake test. The fireman checked the equipment on board and the fuel supplies. Not until these checks had been carried out did the crew begin their actual work.
The fireman began by lighting the fire in the locomotive, then driving it to an inspection pit. Whilst the engine driver looked underneath the engine for any damage, the fireman - equipped with oil can and grease gun - had to service all the grease points on the locomotive (see photograph).
Once all the checks had been carried out and the boiler had reached its operating pressure, the locomotive could drive out of the shed and onto the turntable. After the tracks had been cleared by the signal box, the locomotive officially began its duties and ran out onto the main line.
Disposal of engines.
During the final kilometres to the terminal station the fireman began to prepare for disposal ("Abrüsten") by letting the fire slowly burn down depending on demands of the route. After the train had arrived at the terminus, the fireman turned off the train heating and the locomotive was uncoupled from the wagons. Then the locomotive was returned to the "Betriebswerk", where it first went to the coaling plant, where its coal was replenished. Next the engine proceeded to the ashpit where the boiler was cleaned out by the shed workers ("Betriebsarbeiter"). This involved emptying the ash and clinker from the smokebox and grate into an ashpit sunk between the tracks. This was a particularly dirty job. After completely cleaning out the boiler the engine was run to the water cranes, where the engine's water tanks were refilled. The next stop was the sanding point. At smaller "Betriebswerke", refilling the sanders was manual work using buckets and ladders.
Because the locomotive was now fully equipped with everything it needed for its next duty, it was either stabled in the locomotive shed or on a spare stabling road and cleaned further by the fireman. Repairs were dealt with by the staff responsible for them during the night. Afterwards the engine was prepared for its next duty.
Washing out.
The boiler of a steam locomotive had to be cleaned at regular intervals. This took place in the "Bahnbetriebswerk" at laid down times. The interval between boiler washouts varied according to the quality of the boiler feedwater, the frequency of runs and the demands of the routes being worked on the locomotive. The washing out of a steam locomotive boiler consisted in six stages of work:
First the boiler had to be blown down. After it had cooled, the water was drained. Once this was completed, the cleaning of the boiler could begin. After that the boiler was refilled and heated up again.
When a locomotive was due for boiler cleaning, preparations for washing out were started even whilst the locomotive was on its final run beforehand.
Routine examinations and scheduled repair work.
Whilst the shed hands were busy washing out a locomotive, fitters carried out routine examinations and scheduled repair tasks. This work was necessary in order to keep the engine operational for as long as possible between general inspections. In order to keep stoppages of locomotives to a minimum this work was distributed throughout the year. Amongst the most important tasks were the biannual brake system checks, the quarterly condition examinations and a yearly main brake inspection. Special tasks are detailed in the following table.
Special duty trains.
In addition to the maintenance of all locomotives, some "Bahnbetriebswerke" are also responsible for looking after special duty trains. The most important units are breakdown trains (for re-railing derailed rolling stock) and rotary snow ploughs. There are also fire fighting trains to enable fires in the area to be put out as quickly as possible. And for the smooth running of a "Bahnbetriebswerk" tractors and shunters are needed in order to move wagons and locomotives that are unable to move under their own power. Finally almost every "Bahnbetriebswerk" has a variety of special vehicles.
Facilities.
Key: 1 - Water crane, 2 - Coaling point, 3 - Signal box, 4 - Roundhouse, 5 - Locomotive repair shop, 6 - Washout equipment, 7 - Inspection pit, 8 - Turntable.
Operating facilities.
The maintenance of a steam locomotive requires a large number of different facilities.
Water points.
The running of steam locomotives required water as well as coal. As a result the water supply of a "Betriebswerk" played an important role. In order to guarantee the supply, almost all "Bahnbetriebswerk" had their own railway waterworks. These waterworks were equipped with various systems for delivering water (pumps, pipes, water containers and take-off points). Many "Bahnbetriebswerke" had two different waterworks: one railway waterworks that provided water for the engines and a drinking waterworks that supplied water for the employees of the depot. When "Betriebswerke" were eventually connected to the regional water network, their drinking waterworks was usually closed down. 
The water was extracted from springs, wells and ponds and then cleaned. Industrial water for the running the steam locomotives had to have a high level of quality. As a result the railway waterworks developed their own filtering systems, where the water for operations was made usable. Especially important were the salt content and the hardness of the water.
After cleaning, the industrial water was pumped into a water tower and drawn from there. These facilities had various designs; there was no standard type. All water towers had several up and down pipes. The water towers supplied all areas with industrial water, including the water cranes used to replenish the water supplies of steam locomotives (whether they had tenders or water tanks). Water cranes were usually located near the inspection pits or at coaling points. They, too, came in various shapes and sizes, although these were gradually replaced by standard types of water crane.
Large and medium-sized "Bahnbetriebswerke" had their own laboratory that continuously monitored the water processing; in particularly checking the preparation of the boiler feedwater which was tested regularly. The laboratory specified the salt content, the pH value and the composition of the feedwater. The enginemen had to bring samples of feedwater to the laboratory at specified intervals. In addition to testing the water, the laboratory was also responsible for checking oils and greases delivered to the depot.
Locomotive sheds.
Every large "Betriebswerk" had its own roundhouse with a turntable. The locomotives were turned on the turntable and berthed in the roundhouse. This was heated so that the steam locomotives did not fully cool down, otherwise raising steam took too long. 
In order to move steam locomotives that were stored 'cold', locomotive winches were installed. It was prescribed by almost all railway companies that at least 75% of all locomotives had to be able to be berthed in the locomotive shed, the rest would be stabled on stabling roads in the open.
Large "Betriebswerke" often had two or three roundhouses with their associated turntables. The roundhouse was reliant on the turntable; if it became incapacitated the entire shed was out of commission because locomotives could not be run in or out of it. The turntable therefore had an emergency engine which used compressed air. Over the course of time, a standard turntable with a 26m long track was adopted.
Turntables were always at the mercy of the weather and in very heavy use, so they had to be serviced at regular intervals. In fact every "Bahnbetriebswerk" with a turntable should also have had a triangle or wye, so that if the turntable was out of action, locomotives could still be turned. However, because wyes needed a lot of space they were only rarely built.
Smaller "Betriebswerke" often only had a parallel-road shed, which could be reached via turnouts. Every "Bahnbetriebswerk" had to have enough space in order that it could be extended in any direction. 
Smaller maintenance jobs were carried out in the locomotive shed itself. For more specialised repair or maintenance tasks there was usually an engine repair shop, most of which had an overhead crane with which heavy components could be moved.
Sanding points.
Trouble-free locomotive running requires that there is sufficient traction between wheel and rail. Steam engines therefore had sandboxes (usually two, on top of the boiler). These were filled with the help of sanding equipment. For sanding there was either a sanding system with an elevated bunker or a sanding tower. The special sand was kept in its own store. On a sanding tower a telescopic pipe was hooked up to the sandbox, the lock released and the locomotive sandbox filled as required. All "Betriebswerke" had to have enough sand for at least 30 days.
Coaling points.
Every "Bahnbetriebswerk" had one or more coaling points for the delivery and unloading of coal. In addition, they had to store the fuel and carry out the replenishment of locomotive coal tanks or tenders.
Coaling facilities came in various shapes and sizes, dependent on the daily consumption. Coal was delivered was by rail, either using normal goods wagons or with special self-discharging hoppers. The coal was stored in large bunkers ("Kohlebansen") which usually had side walls made of concrete (on smaller "Betriebswerke" these were also made of old sleepers and section of rail.) Each "Bahnbetriebswerk" stored the daily coal requirement in a main bunker, the rest of the coal was stored in one or more reserve bunkers. 
Coaling the locomotives could be carried out in various ways. Many "Betriebswerke" ferried the coal from the bunkers using small narrow gauge tub wagons on rails to a rotating crane which then lifted them and tippled their contents into the tender of the locomotive. Large "Betriebswerke" had coaling stages or large coaling plants that had four filled hopper-like bunkers which were equipped with locking devices. When these were removed, the coal ran down into the locomotive tender. With this type, coal was transferred to the four small bunkers from the main bunkers using a large crane. Because these two variants needed rather a lot of space, small and medium-sized "Betriebswerke" had an overhead chute. The coal was transported in tub wagons again; these were then placed in a lift, hoisted up and then tippled down the chute, allowing the coal to run into the tender of the steam locomotive.
Next to the coaling station there were often water cranes and works buildings. In addition, there were often store rooms for these facilities nearby.
Ashpits.
At the ashpits, the grate, ashpan and smokebox of the steam locomotive were cleaned as part of its disposal routine after duties. The combustion of coal left behind about 20% of combustion residue. This was scraped off with various implements (scrapers, hooks and special brushes) and emptied into the ashpit ("Schlackegrube" or "Schlackekanal") which were located on special ashpit tracks in the open. The ash and cinders were left in the pit until it was emptied. This was either carried out by hand or with a hoist ("Schrägaufzug") (see photograph right). By this means, the ash was shovelled into trolleys, which were lifted and tipped into a wagon that then transport the ash away. 
Tube cleaning.
During locomotive running, unburnt pieces of coal, ash and cinders lodged in the heating and smoke tubes, which therefore had to be cleaned out at specified intervals. Usually, this process took place every 500 to 1,000 kilometres. The tube cleaning equipment consisted of a mobile work platform and a compressed air pipe to blow through the heating and smoke tubes. For this activity, an employee (the tube cleaner) carried out this job on a designated siding. Cleaning all the tubes could take about an hour. A DR Class 01.5, for example, had 168 heating and smoke tubes.
Boiler washout points.
The boiler of a steam locomotive had to be cleaned at regular intervals. Although boiler feedwater was thoroughly filtered, it contained a number of chemical compounds that did not fully evaporate. These compounds precipitated in due course as sludge and boiler scale, which could in time block the tubes or impede heat transfer within the boiler, leading to hazards in operating the engine. This meant that boilers had to be washed out regularly, either every ten to 14 days or after 2,000 kilometres for express locomotives and 1,500 kilometres on goods train locomotives. Cold washing a boiler took up to 14 hours. For hot washing, a special washout point was needed. For this purpose, locomotive sheds had a separate washout road with a washout channel. Every "Bahnbetriebswerk" had an additional washout road outside the shed. The used washing water drained into this channel and could be used for other purposes if need be.
Engineering facilities.
In addition to its running facilities, every "Bahnbetriebswerk" also had a large number of engineering facilities. These included, for example, traversers and turntables. Most important were the wheel drops. Usually located in the locomotive shed or the workshop, they facilitated changing the wheelsets. Initially there were many different wheel set designs until a standard type was developed. With the aid of a wheel drop, an axle could be replaced in just half an hour.
For smaller repair jobs, the workshops in a "Bahnbetriebswerk" had their own wheelset lathes. Higher than normal wear and tear on the tyres made it necessary to reprofile them ahead of scheduled overhauls. Each workshop was also equipped with a wide range of tools. At medium and large "Bahnbetriebswerke", the workshop was divided into different departments. So there might have been a mechanical engineering workshop, a blacksmith's shop, a tool shop, a locksmith's shop, a foundry and an electrician's shop (this had little importance however). Moreover, in addition to the departments, sometimes there were several facilities for specialist tasks. For example, individual workshops like pump and boiler repairs might be established.
Other facilities.
As well as the operational facilities, a "Bahnbetriebswerk" also had staff accommodation (showers and wash rooms, rest rooms for depot and locomotive staff, sleeping accommodation for locomotive crews and, in larger "Bahnbetriebswerke" a mess room too). Because "Bahnbetriebswerke" often had a lot of trackage, many were allocated their own signal box from which the various activities were controlled and directed. The locomotive shed itself was heated, so that the steam locomotives did not completely cool down, because otherwise it took too long to raise steam pressure.
Management.
Work groups.
In order to optimise the pattern of work, individual functions were allocated to various groups of staff as follow:
This system was used by the Deutsche Bundesbahn as well as the Deutsche Reichsbahn, however the Reichsbahn had different names for the groups. The Austrian railways were organised in a similar way; here, too, the different tasks were divided up.
Group A: Managerial Functions
Group A was normally only found at larger "Bahnbetriebswerke" because there the managerial workload was the greatest. At smaller depots the shedmaster ("Bahnbetriebswerkvorsteher") took on these tasks; medium-sized "Betriebswerke" the management functions were split between groups B and C. Group A had to draw up plans for the efficient running of the depot and for the allocation of locomotives. In addition they were responsible for the overall budget (awarding of fuel efficiency bonuses and payment of holiday and sickness pay). The management of operating records and locomotive cards (including mileages and fuel consumption of the rolling stock) as well as the oversight of energy consumption and the consumption of fuels (especially coal, water and gas) were also assigned to this group.
Group B: Locomotive Running
Group B was responsible for the running of locomotives. At a large depot, they were headed by an inspector ("Inspektor"), who was usually also the deputy to the shedmaster ("Dienstvorsteher"), and who was supported by various assistants and running foremen ("Lokdienstleiter"). The majority of large "Bahnbetriebswerke" also had an outside running foreman and their own duty roster clerk ("Diensteinteiler"). Smaller "Betriebswerke" handed the functions of this group to the running foreman. Group B, which was referred to by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as "Sektion Triebfahrzeug-Betrieb" (locomotive running section), had to look after everything to do with locomotive and train running. Tasks assigned to this group included supervising locomotive operations, clearing defects and faults, drawing up locomotive diagrams and crew rosters, allocating staff and engines, checking locomotive records, training personnel, managing all documents and the care and supply of all engines (heating, coaling and cleaning). The drawing up of tasks, locomotive diagrams and crew rosters was later taken over by so-called 'technologists' ("Technologen").
Group C: Locomotive Repair
The management of Group C – locomotive repair – also fell to a Reichsbahn inspector. He had the role of a mechanical foreman and was usually a deputy to the shedmaster. Several master tradesmen reported to him, depending on the size of the "Betriebswerk". This group comprised several gangs of tradesmen (up to 30 employees) who in turn were led by various subordinate foremen. The Deutsche Reichsbahn also called this group the "Abteilung Triebfahrzeug-Unterhaltung" (locomotive maintenance department). Group C was responsible for carrying out repair and maintenance jobs, transferring damaged rolling stock to the main repair shops, ordering spare parts and materials including management of the spare parts store, monitoring new vehicle systems, keeping the breakdown train ready and recovering broken down vehicles.
Group D: Wagon operations and repair
Group D had a special role within the "Betriebswerk" and not every depot had such a department. Smaller "Betriebswerke" allocated these tasks to a master tradesman's gang in group C, that had a maximum of 40 staff. Both the DB and the DR during the 1950s established larger D groups at independent locations, known as "Betriebswagenwerke" or wagon depots. Where this was not the case, Group D was headed by another inspector to whom, depending on the size of the depot, up to three wagon foremen ("Wagenmeister") reported. This group was responsible for checking reports of damage, repairing damage and defects, supervising the shunting foremen at stations, clearing up operational irregularities, refilling gas and disinfection facilities for wagons, cleaning, lighting and heating of wagons, maintenance and repair jobs, dispatching wagons to the main repair shops, ordering spare parts and materials for wagons, including the management of the spare parts and monitoring new systems on wagons. 
Group E: Engineering Facilities
The composition of Group E depended on the size of the "Bahnbetriebswerk". In the DR this group was called the "Abteilung Technische Anlagen" (Engineering Facilities department). In the Bundesbahn this department was further divided into two sub-groups. At medium-sized and large "Bahnbetriebswerke" the group was headed by a Reichsbahn inspector. At smaller depots, Group E comprised a maximum of 20 railwaymen - who mainly belonged to Group C. This group was crucial to ensuring smooth running operations. Their range of tasks included looking after the gas, water, steam and heating installations as well as coaling, sanding and loading stations (cranes, turntables, and traversers also fell into their area of responsibility), maintaining the electrical installations, weighbridges and track brakes, ordering spare parts and materials including management of the spares store and the instruction and control of the machine operators.
Group F: Fuel and Oil Storage
Large "Betriebswerke" had their own department responsible for the fuel stores - Group F. Smaller depots allocated this work to Group A. Amongst the tasks allotted to Group F were the ordering and stocking of fuel supplies and equipment, management of the equipment records (a type of inventory register), the storage of fuel and control of the stores personnel.
Group K: Motor Transport
Group K was formed in the 1930s and only at a few "Bahnbetriebswerke". In the 1950s the DB and DR hived them off and they finally ended up in the so-called "Kraftwagenbetriebswerke" ("KBW", "KBw") or vehicle depots. Group K was run by a Reichsbahn inspector and had the job of tasking and maintaining motor vehicles, sending them to the main workshops ("Ausbesserungswerke"), controlling and managing their fuel stores and drivers.
Personnel.
The staff of a "Bahnbetriebswerk" comprised a shedmaster ("Dienstvorsteher"), the supervisory staff ("Aufsichtsbeamten"), the running staff ("Betriebsbeamten"), the tradesmen ("Handwerkern"), the depot workers ("Betriebsarbeitern") and the managerial staff ("Verwaltungsangestellten"). The person in charge of a "Bahnbetriebswerk" was the shedmaster – he usually had a mechanical engineering background and was an engineer. At smaller facilities it was often the case that the senior engine driver ran the depot. The shedmaster had to select the staff and conduct examinations. In addition he was in charge of safety in a way, because he had to monitor all safety and working regulations; he was also responsible for the cleanliness of the "Betriebswerk". Because almost all shedmasters had had engine driver training, they had to help out when there was a high traffic loading. The shedmaster had to be present at all serious accidents or other major events.

Antoine Ndinga Oba

Antoine Ndinga Oba (1941 – 17 May 2005) was a Congolese diplomat, political figure, and linguist. During the single-party rule of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), he served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of National Education from 1977 to 1984 and as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1984 to 1991. Later, he was Congo-Brazzaville's Ambassador to UNESCO from 1998 until his death in 2005.
Academic and diplomatic career.
Ndinga Oba was born in 1941 at Biala, near Oyo, located in Cuvette Region. He worked as a professor of linguistics at the Marien Ngouabi University in Brazzaville. From 1972 to 1973, he was Director of the National Institute of Research and Pedagogy, and from 1973 to 1976 he was Director of INSSED; subsequently he was Rector of the University of Brazzaville (later Marien Ngouabi University) from 1976 to 1977.
In 1972, Ndinga Oba was elected to the Central Committee of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), but he was dropped from the Central Committee in 1975. He was appointed as Minister of National Education on 5 April 1977 and returned to the Central Committee in 1979, when Denis Sassou Nguesso, a cousin of Ndinga Oba, became President. In August 1984, Ndinga Oba was moved from his post as Minister of National Education to that of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation; in the same year, he was elected to the PCT's expanded 13-member Political Bureau.
In a September 1986 speech at the United Nations, Ndinga Oba compared apartheid South Africa and Israel to Nazi Germany. Israel complained to the United States about this speech, and the United States in turn complained to Congo; it reportedly pressured the Congolese government with a warning that US President Ronald Reagan might decline to meet with Sassou Nguesso when the latter visited the US in October 1986. In the week after the speech, Ndinga Oba apologized to Israel. He was removed from the Political Bureau at a plenary session of the Central Committee in November 1986, when the Political Bureau's size was decreased from 13 members to 10 members. On 13 August 1989, he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State in the government, while remaining in charge of foreign affairs. He continued to serve as Foreign Minister until 1991, and from 1991 to 1992 he was the Personal Representative of President Sassou Nguesso. 
Ndinga Oba became a professor at the Study Center of Congolese Languages in 1992, remaining there until 1998. He was appointed as Congo's Ambassador to UNESCO, located in Paris, on 20 August 1998. It was believed that he received this posting because he was in poor health and would have access to better medical treatment in Paris. On 7 February 2003, Ndinga Oba was elected as President of the African UNESCO Group by African ambassadors meeting at UNESCO's headquarters. In this capacity, he was charged with coordinating relations between UNESCO and African countries.
As a linguist, Ndinga Oba wrote extensively on Bantu languages. In 2004, he published a two-volume linguistic study, "The Bantu Languages of Congo-Brazzaville: Typological Study of the Languages of Group C20 (Mbosi or Mbochi)" ("Les langues bantoues du Congo-Brazzaville – Étude typologique des langues du groupe C20 (mbosi ou mbochi)"). Other linguistic books written by Ndinga Oba included "Lingala and Mounoukoutouba: two variants of Kibangou" ("Le lingala et le Mounoukoutouba - deux variantes de Kibangou") and "Lexical Structures of Lingala" ("Structures lexicologiques du lingala"). He also wrote on the subject of education; in 1989, he published "Education in Africa: the Case of Congo" ("L'Education en Afrique, le cas du Congo"). Another book by Ndinga Oba, "On the Banks of the Alima" ("Sur les rives de l'Alima"), was published in Paris in 2003. "On the Banks of the Alima" (its title is a reference to the Alima River; Ndinga Oba was born near the Alima) is a philosophical story that takes the form of a dialogue between a father and daughter; it focuses on the need to maintain a connection to the past and preserve cultural heritage, while at the same time looking outward towards the world and embracing a positive form of globalization.
While serving as Ambassador to UNESCO, Ndinga Oba died on 17 May 2005 in Paris. His body was returned to Congo-Brazzaville, and after a tribute at the Palace of the Parliament in Brazzaville, he was buried at his family cemetery in Oyo on 27 May 2005. President Sassou Nguesso and Gabonese President Omar Bongo were present for his funeral.

Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner

Boies, Schiller & Flexner L.L.P. is an American law firm founded by David Boies and Jonathan D. Schiller in 1997. In 1999, they were joined by Donald L. Flexner, former partner with Crowell & Moring. In 2002, a 27-lawyer firm, located in Miami, named Zack Kosnitzky, merged into the New York firm Boies Schiller & Flexner.
The firm has had a number of major clients, and tried numerous cases that are familiar to law students and the public at large. One of the firm’s first cases was representing a software manufacturer in the antitrust action "United States v. Microsoft". A few years after that, David Boies and his firm were facing off with veteran litigator Ted Olson in the Supreme Court, in "Bush v. Gore". 
The firm focuses on litigation, but has wider coverage. Though it has a number of attorneys who are specialists, first and foremost every attorney is a litigator, and the firm has taken on prominent cases, including working alongside previous opponent Ted Olson in challenging California’s Proposition 8 in "Perry v. Brown".
On March 12, 2011, The NFL announced that it has hired David Boies and Paul Clement, head of law firm King & Spalding’s appellate practice and the former United States Solicitor General who will work with outside counsel Gregg Levy of Covington & Burling in representing the league in the antitrust litigation initiated by the players' union.

Latangi

Latangi (pronounced latāngi) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 63rd "Melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Geetapriya or Gitapriya in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 3rd rāgam in the 11th "chakra Rudra". The mnemonic name is "Rudra-Go". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ri gu mi pa dha nu". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Sarasangi", which is the 27th "melakarta".
"Janya" rāgams.
"Latangi" has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with "Latangi".
Compositions.
Here are a few common compositions sung in concerts, set to "Latangi".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Latangi's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Sooryakantam" and "Senavati". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer "Graha bhedam on Sooryakantam".

Tony Lundy

Tony Lundy was a Detective Superintendent within the Metropolitan Police Service, most famous for his involvement in the 'supergrass' trials of criminals in the 1970s and 1980s.
Supergrasses.
Throughout the 1970s, the supergrass was a feared tool that the police had begun using which is generally considered to have begun with Bertie Smalls, who, faced with a hefty prison sentence for his part in leading his gang of armed robbers, the 'Wembley Mob', decided to turn 'Queen's Evidence' against his fellow thieves which resulted in them receiving heavy prison sentences whilst Smalls was granted immunity from prosecution. Although after the Smalls trial immunity could no longer be granted, criminals who turned supergrass could expect to be rewarded with the 'supergrass tariff', normally a sentence of around five years, most of which would be spent in police custody.
Early successes.
In May 1977 Lundy, then a Detective Chief Inspector, rejoined the flying squad. His first success was with David Smith in September of that year. Smith was involved in a wages snatch in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, along with George Williams, who too turned supergrass. Smith's confession resulted in sixty nine people being charged, of which ninety per cent pleaded guilty. Lundy was also involved in the initial investigation into Harry MacKenny and John Childs, who was the first serial murderer in modern times to turn supergrass.
Retirement.
Lundy retired from the Metropolitan Police in 1988 on ill-health grounds suffering from stress. He was investigated in October 1994 and the Crown Prosecution Service stated they had found no evidence to prosecute Lundy. Lundy stated that throughout the investigation he had not once been interviewed. He also sold his story to the "News of the World", entitled 'Bent or Brilliant?' He now resides in Spain.

John Dalrymple, 14th Earl of Stair

John David James Dalrymple, 14th Earl of Stair (born 4 September 1961) is a British politician who, since 2008, has been a crossbench member of the House of Lords.
Background.
Stair is the eldest child of John Dalrymple, 13th Earl of Stair and Davina Katherine Bowes-Lyon (born 2 May 1930), daughter of David Bowes-Lyon, brother of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Lord Stair's mother, Davina, therefore, is a first cousin of The Queen and he is a second cousin of The Prince of Wales, The Princess Royal, The Duke of York, and The Earl of Wessex.
Political career.
On inheriting his peerage in 1996, Lord Stair entered the House of Lords and sat as a crossbencher—that is, an independent. In 1999, the House of Lords Act removed the rights of all hereditary peers to sit in the House; however, ninety-two peers were permitted to remain in the House, elected by other peers. He failed to be elected at that time. Following the death of Davina Ingrams, 18th Baroness Darcy de Knayth in 2008, Lord Stair was elected to the Lords, on, 13 October 2011, he made a speech in the Aviation Debate.
Family.
Lord Stair married Emily Mary Julia Stonor, daughter of Ralph Stonor, 7th Baron Camoys and Elizabeth Mary Hyde Parker, in 2006. 
They have two children:

Captive service

Captive Service is a portion of Business Process Outsourcing where an organization will use a wholly owned subsidiary instead of a Third Party Vendor. The benefit of doing such an arrangement would be to leverage the cost savings of using offshore resources, while maintaining complete control over process and delivery. The costs of such an arrangement are generally higher than using a vendor.
Captive Service Units have been in the media lately because of large financial firms tied to the Subprime mortgage crisis. Many of the firms had captive service units and as they file for bankruptcy, these units are being sold separately. Specifically, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, AIG and Merrill Lynch all have captive units that are being considered or have already been sold off.

<doc id="19690443" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19690443" title="Celtic animism">
Celtic animism

According to classical sources, the ancient Celts were animists. They honoured the forces of nature, saw the world as inhabited by many spirits, and saw the Divine manifesting in aspects of the natural world. 
Overview: the sacred land.
The Celts of the ancient world believed that many spirits and divine beings inhabited the world around them, and that humans could establish a rapport with these beings. The archaeological and the literary record indicate that ritual practice in Celtic societies lacked a clear distinction between the sacred and profane; rituals, offerings, and correct behaviour maintained a balance between gods, spirits and humans and harnessed supernatural forces for the benefit of the community.
The pagan Celts perceived the presence of the supernatural as integral to, and interwoven with, the material world. Every mountain, river, spring, marsh, tree and rocky outcrop was inspirited. While the polytheistic cultures of ancient Greece and Rome revolved around urban life, ancient Celtic society was predominantly rural. The close link with the natural world is reflected in what we know of the religious systems of Celtic Europe during the late 1st millennium BC and early 1st millennium AD. As in many polytheistic systems, the local spirits honoured were those of both the wild and cultivated landscapes and their inhabitants. As Anne Ross observed, "god-types, as opposed to individual universal Gaulish deities, are to be looked for as an important feature of the religion of the Gauls ... and the evidence of epigraphy strongly supports this conclusion." As what some may consider spirits are considered by other authors to be deities, the list of Celtic deities derived from local inscriptions can at times be rather long.
The ancient Celts venerated the spirits who inhabited local mountains, forests and springs. Certain animals were seen as messengers of the spirits or gods. In Tribal territories, the ground and waters which received the dead were imbued with sanctity and revered by their living relatives. Sanctuaries were sacred spaces separated from the ordinary world, often in natural locations such as springs, sacred groves or lakes. Many topographical features were honored as the abodes of powerful spirits or deities, with geographical features named for tutelary deities. Offerings of jewelry, weapons or foodstuffs were placed in offering pits and bodies of water dedicated to these beings. These offerings linked the donor to the place and spirits in a concrete way.
Honouring the waters.
The spirits of watery places were honoured as givers of life and as links between the physical realm and the other world. Sequana, for example, seems to have embodied the River Seine at its spring source, and Sulis appears to have been one and the same as the hot spring at Bath, Somerset, (Roman Aquae Sulis) not simply its guardian or possessor. In Ireland, the tutelary goddesses Boann and Sionnan give their names to the rivers Boyne and Shannon, and the tales of these goddesses are the origin stories of the rivers themselves. The threefold goddess Brighid is associated with a number of holy wells and The Morrígan is connected with the River Unius.
There is abundant evidence for the veneration of water by the Celts and indeed by their Bronze Age forebears. In the Pre-Roman Iron Age, lakes, rivers, springs and bogs received special offerings of metalwork, wooden objects, animals and, occasionally, of human beings. By the Roman period, the names of some water-deities were recorded on inscriptions or were included in contemporary texts. The ancient name for the River Marne was Matrona ‘Great Mother;’ the Seine was Sequana; the Severn, Sabrina; the Wharfe, Verbeia; the Saône, Souconna, and there are countless others. Natural springs were foci for healing cults: Sulis was prayed to as a healer at Aquae Sulis and the goddess Arnemetia was hailed as a healer at Aquae Arnemetiae. Nemausus, for example, was not only the Gallic name for the town of Nîmes but also that of its presiding spring-god. He had a set of three female counterparts, the Nemausicae. In the same region, the town of Glanum possessed a god called Glanis: an altar from a sacred spring is inscribed ‘to Glanis and the Glanicae’.
Spirits of the weather and the skies.
Meteorological patterns and phenomena, especially wind, rain and thunder, were acknowledged as inspirited and propitiated. Inscribed dedications and iconography in the Roman period show that these spirits were personifications of natural forces. Taranis’s name indicates not that he was the god of thunder but that he actually was thunder. Archaeological evidence suggests that the thunder was perceived as especially potent. Inscriptions to Taranis the ‘Thunderer’ have been found in Britain, Gaul, Germany and the former Yugoslavia and the Roman poet Lucan mentions him as a savage god who demanded human sacrifice. In the insular Celtic lands, Lugh is seen as a god of the storms, as are the Cailleachan - Scottish storm hags - and the Cailleach herself, who brings the first winter snows to the land by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: "féileadh mòr") in the Whirlpool of Coire Bhreacain. This process is said to take three days, during which the roar of the coming tempest is heard as far away as twenty miles (32 km) inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.
From the early Bronze Age, people in much of temperate Europe used the spoked wheel to represent Taranis. The Romans imported their own celestial god, Jupiter, to continental Celtic lands by "interpretatio romana", and his imagery was merged with that of a native deity to produce a hybrid sky-deity who resembled the Roman god but who had additional solar attributes. Altars decorated with wheels were set up by Roman soldiers stationed at Hadrian's Wall, and also by supplicants in Cologne and Nîmes.
Sacred trees.
The Celts believed that trees had spirits and revered certain trees. The most sacred trees of Ireland were the bíle trees - old, sacred trees that stood in a central area and were often the social and ceremonial meeting place for a tribe or village. According to the Dindsenchas (lore of Irish places), the five sacred Bíles of Ireland were the Ash of Tortu, the Bole of Ross (a yew tree); the Oak of Mugna, and the Ash of Dathi. These trees were associated with the five Irish provinces then in existence.
Animal omens.
Among both the Continental and Insular Celts, the behaviour of certain animals and birds were observed for omens, and certain spirits were closely associated with particular animals. The names of Artio the ursine goddess and Epona the equine goddess are based on Celtic words for ‘bear’ and ‘horse’, respectively. In Ireland, the Morrígan is associated with crows, wolves and horses, among other creatures, and in Scotland Brighid's animals include snakes and cattle. Certain creatures were observed to have particular physical and mental qualities and characteristics, and distinctive patterns of behaviour. An animal like a stag or horse could be admired for its beauty, speed or virility. Dogs were seen to be keen-scented, good at hunting, guarding and healing themselves. Snakes were seen to be emblematic of long (possibly eternal) life, being able to shed their skin and renew themselves. Deer (who shed antlers) suggest cycles of growth; in Ireland they are sacred to the goddess Flidais, while in Scotland they are guarded by the Cailleach. Beavers were seen to be skillful workers in wood. Thus admiration and acknowledgment for a beast’s essential nature led easily to reverence of those qualities and abilities which humans did not possess at all or possessed only partially.
The hunt.
Hunting deities, whose role acknowledges the economic importance of animals and the ritual of the hunt, highlight a different relationship to nature. The animal elements in half-human, antlered deities suggest that the forest and its denizens possessed a numinous quality as well as an economic value.
Hunter-gods were venerated among the Continental Celts, and they often seem to have had an ambivalent role as protector both of the hunter and the prey, not unlike the functions of Diana and Artemis in classical mythology. From Gaul, the armed deer-hunter depicted on an image from the temple of Le Donon in the Vosges lays his hands in benediction on the antlers of his stag companion. The hunter-god from Le Touget in Gers carries a hare tenderly in his arms. Arduinna, the eponymous boar-goddess of the Ardennes, rides her ferocious quarry, knife in hand, whilst the boar-god of Euffigneix in the Haute-Marne is portrayed with the motif of a boar with bristles erect, striding along his torso, which implies conflation between the human animal perception of divinity. Arawn of Welsh mythology may represent the remnants of a similar hunter-god of the forests of Dyfed. Additionally, in Welsh mythology the hunting of a sacred stag often leads the hunters into the Otherworld.
As with many traditional societies, the hunt was probably hedged about with prohibitions and rituals. The Greek author Arrian, writing in the 2nd century AD, said that the Celts never went hunting without the gods’ blessing and that they made payment of domestic animals to the supernatural powers in reparation for their theft of wild creatures from the landscape. Hunting itself may have been perceived as a symbolic, as well as practical, activity in which the spilling of blood led not only to the death of the beast but also to the earth’s nourishment and replenishment.

Foot orienteering

Foot orienteering (foot-O) is the oldest formal orienteering sport, and the one with the most "starts" per year. Usually, a foot-O is a timed race in which participants start at staggered intervals, are individually timed, and are expected to perform all navigation on their own. The control points are shown on the orienteering map and must be visited in the specified order. Standings are determined first by successful completion of the course, then by shortest time on course.
Foot-O is one of four orienteering sports governed by the International Orienteering Federation.
History.
The history of orienteering begins in the late 19th century in Sweden, the actual term "orienteering" was first used in 1886 and meant the crossing of unknown land with the aid of a map and a compass. The first orienteering competition open to the public was held in Norway in 1897. Notable dates for member nations of the IOF are shown below.

Wallingford Regatta is a rowing regatta which takes place on Dorney Lake, Buckinghamshire near Eton next to the River Thames in southern England. It attracts crews from schools, clubs and universities from around the United Kingdom.
The regatta was formerly "Wallingford Skiff Regatta" the only organised boating in 1949 on the Wallingford stretch of the Thames above Cleeve Lock. It had taken place every year in peace time since the late 1890s and there is evidence that it existed as early as 1861. In 1949 the regatta committee founded Wallingford Rowing Club which purchased some old boats and, with mostly novice rowers, started competing in other regattas. The regatta was developed as a conventional regatta although it still awards the Wallingford Skiff Regatta Cup.
The regatta was held on the same reach at Wallingford for most of its existence, but river conditions caused problems and there was pressure for larger facilities. In 2005 a local pub regatta on the same reach was gate-crashed by a BBC programme creating a remake of Three Men in a Boat. Wallingford Regatta itself had moved to its current course on Dorney Lake in 2001.

Stichodactyla toxin

Stichodactyla toxin (ShK) is a peptide toxin that blocks the voltage-gated potassium channels: Kv1.1, Kv1.3, Kv1.6, Kv3.2 and KCa3.1.
Structure.
ShK is a 35-residue basic peptide first discovered in the sea anemone "Stichodactyla helianthus" by Professor Olga Castaneda from the University of Havana, Cuba, and her collaborators in Sweden. The formula is C169H274N54O48S7. It is cross-linked by three disulfide bridges: Cys3-Cys35, Cys12-Cys28, and Cys17-Cys32 (see figure below). The amino acid sequence of the ShK toxin is Arg-Ser-Cys-Ile-Asp-Thr-Ile-Pro-Lys-Ser-Arg-Cys-Thr-Ala-Phe-Gln-Cys-Lys-His-Ser-Met-Lys-Tyr-Arg-Leu-Ser-Phe-Cys-Arg-Lys-Thr-Cys-Gly-Thr-Cys. ShK is stabilized by three disulfide bridges and consists of two short α-helices comprising residues 14-19 and 21-24. The N-terminal eight residues of ShK adopt an extended conformation, followed by a pair of interlocking turns that resemble a 310 helix, while its C-terminal Cys35 residue forms a nearly head-to-tail cyclic structure through a disulfide bond with Cys3. Protein domains with structural resemblance to ShK have been described in 402 proteins, most of them from "C. elegans" (). The SMART database at the EMBL has a list of the 402 proteins containing ShK-like sequences (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de). Other proteins containing domains with similar structures include the cysteine-rich secretory protein snake toxins natrin, triflin, and stecrisp, the "Toxocara canis" mucins, secreted peptides from the dog hookworm Ancylostoma caninum, and the human proteins Tpx-1 and matrix metalloprotease 23 (MMP23) 
Target.
ShK toxin blocks the K+ channels Kv1.1, Kv1.3, Kv1.6, Kv3.2 and KCa<3.1, The peptide binds to all four subunits in the Kv1.3 tetramer through its interaction with the shallow vestibule at the outer entrance of the ion conduction pathway. The peptide's Lysine22 residue occludes the channel pore like a "cork in a bottle". This blocks the entrance to the pore.
ShK blocks the Kv1.3 channel in T cells with a Kd of about 11 pM. It blocks the neuronal Kv1.1 and Kv1.6 channels with Kds of 16 pM and 200 pM respectively. The Kv3.2 and KCa3.1 channels are more than 1000 times less sensitive to the peptide.
Several ShK analogs have been generated to enhance specificity for the Kv1.3 channel over the Kv1.1, Kv1.6 and Kv3.2 channels. The first analog that showed some degree of specificity was ShK-Dap22. Attaching a fluorescein to the N-terminus of the peptide via a hydrophilic AEEA linker (2-aminoethoxy-2-ethoxy acetic acid; mini-PEG) resulted in a peptide, ShK-F6CA, with 100-fold specificity for Kv1.3 over Kv1.1 and related channels. Based on this surprising finding additional analogs were made. ShK-170 ShK(L5),contains a L-phosphotyrosine in place of the fluorescein in ShK-F6CA. It blocks Kv1.3 with a Kd of 69 pM and shows exquisite specificity for Kv1.3. However, it is chemically unstable. To improve stability a new analog, ShK-186 SL5, was made with the C-terminal carboxyl of ShK-170 replaced by an amide; ShK-186 is otherwise identical to ShK-170. In rats and squirrel monkeys, an indium-labeled ShK-186 analog called ShK-221, was slowly released from the injection site and maintained blood levels above the channel blocking dose for 3–5 days </ref> ShK-192 is a new analog with increased stability. It contains norleucine21 in place of methionine21 to avoid methionine oxidation, and the terminal phosphotyrosine is replaced by a non-hydrolyzable para-phosphonophenylalanine (Ppa) group. ShK-192 is effective in ameliorating disease in rat models of multiple sclerosis. The D-diasteromer of ShK is also stable but blocks Kv1.3 with 2800-fold potency than the L-form (Kd = 36 nM) and it only exhibits 2-fold specificity for Kv1.3 over Kv1.1.
Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 regulate membrane potential and calcium signaling of T cells. Calcium entry through the CRAC channel is promoted by potassium efflux through the Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 potassium channels. Blockade of Kv1.3 channels in effector-memory T cells by ShK-186 suppresses calcium signaling, cytokine production (interferon-gamma, interleukin 2) and cell proliferation. In vivo, ShK-186 paralyzes effector-memory T cells at the sites of inflammation and prevent their reactivation in inflamed tissues. In contrast, ShK-186 does not affect the homing to and motility within lymph nodes of naive and central memory T cells, most likely because these cells express the KCa3.1 channel and are therefore protected from the effect of Kv1.3 blockade. In proof-of-concept studies, ShK and its analogs have prevented and treated disease in rat models of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and delayed type hypersensitivity. ShK-186, due to its durable pharmacological action, is effective in ameliorating disease in rat models of delayed type hypersensitivity, multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and rheumatoid arthritis (pristane induced arthritis) when administered once every 2–5 days. ShK-186 has completed non-clinical safety studies as is being evaluated in phase 1 human trials.
As ShK toxin binds to the synaptosomal membranes, it facilitates an acetylcholine release at avian neuromuscular junctions while the Kv3.2 channels are expressed in neurons that fire at a high frequency (such as cortical GABAergic interneurons), due to their fast activation and deactivation rates. By blocking Kv3.2, ShK toxin depolarises the cortical GABAergic interneurons. Kv3.2 is also expressed in pancreatic beta cells. These cells are thought to play a role in their delayed-rectifier current, which regulates glucose-dependent firing. Therefore, ShK, as a Kv3.2 blocker, might be useful in the treatment of type-2 diabetes, although inhibition of the delayed-rectifier current has not yet been observed in human cells even when very high ShK concentrations were used.
Toxicity.
Toxicity of ShK toxin in mice is quite low. The median paralytic dose is about 25 mg/kg bodyweight (which translates to 0.5 mg per 20 g mouse). In rats the therapeutic safety index was greater than 75-fold.
ShK-Dap22 is less toxic, even a dose of 1.0 mg dose did not cause hyperactivity, seizures or mortality. The median paralytic dose was 200 mg/kg body weight.
ShK-170 ShK(L5) does not cause significant toxicity in vitro. The peptide was not toxic to human and rat lymphoid cells incubated for 48 h with 100 nM of ShK-170 (>1200 times greater than the Kv1.3 half-blocking dose). The same high concentration of ShK-170 was negative in the Ames test on tester strain TA97A, suggesting that it is not a mutagen. ShK-170 had no effect on heart rate or heart rate variability parameters in either the time or the frequency domain in rats. It does not block the hERG (Kv11.1) channel that is associated with drug-associated cardiac arrhythmias. Repeated daily administration of the peptide by subcutaneous injection (10 µg/kg/day) for 2 weeks to rats does not cause any changes in blood counts, blood chemistry or in the proportion of thymocyte or lymphocyte subsets. Furthermore, the rats administered the peptide gain weight normally.
ShK-186 SL5 is also safe. Repeated daily administration by subcutaneous injection of ShK-186 (100 µg/kg/day) for 4 weeks to rats does not cause any changes in blood counts, blood chemistry or histopathology. Furthermore, ShK-186 did not compromise the protective immune response to acute influenza viral infection or acute bacterial (Chlamydia) infection in rats at concentrations that were effective in ameliorating autoimmune diseases in rat models. Interestingly, rats repeatedly administered ShK-186 for a month by subcutaneous injection (500 µg/kg/day) developed low titer anti-ShK antibodies. The reason for the low immunogenicity of the peptide is not well understood. ShK-186 has completed GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) non-clinical safety studies in rodents and non-human primates, and ShK-186 is currently being evaluated in phase 1 human trials.
Many groups are developing Kv1.3 blockers for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
Use.
Because ShK toxin is a specific inhibitor of Kv1.1, Kv1.3, Kv1.6, Kv3.2 and KCa3.1, it may serve as a useful pharmacological tool for studying these channels. The Kv1.3 specific ShK analogs, ShK-170, ShK-186 and ShK-192, have been demonstrated to be effective in rat models of autoimmune diseases, and these or related analogs might have use as therapeutics for human autoimmune diseases.
Kv1.3 is also considered a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, for enhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, and for preventing bone resorption in periodontal disease. Furthermore, because pancreatic beta cells, which have Kv3.2 channels, are thought to play a role in glucose-dependent firing, ShK, as a Kv3.2 blocker, might be useful in the treatment of type-2 diabetes, although inhibition of the delayed-rectifier current has not yet been observed in human cells even when very high ShK concentrations were used.

1958–59 Liga Alef

The 1958–59 Liga Alef season saw Bnei Yehuda win the title and promotion to Liga Leumit.
Relegation play-offs.
A promotion-relegation play-off between the 11th and 12th placed clubs in Liga Alef, Maccabi Sha'arayim and Hapoel Afula, and the second placed clubs of the regional divisions of Liga Bet, Hapoel Netanya and Hapoel Be'er Sheva. Each club played the other three once.
Shortly after the Relegation play-offs, Hapoel Afula was disqualified for fielding Zvi Singel, who was also listed at the Israeli football association as a player of lower division club, Hapoel Beit HaShita. as a result, Afula lost their Liga Alef status, and Hapoel Netanya took their place in Liga Alef.

Alfred Philippe Roll

Alfred Philippe Roll (1 March 1846 – 27 October 1919) was a French painter.
Career.
Roll studied at École des Beaux-Arts, where he was taught by Jean-Léon Gérôme, Henri-Joseph Harpignies, Charles-François Daubigny and Léon Bonnat. He painted his first landscape in 1869, and in 1870 exhibited "Environs of Baccarat" and "Evening" at Salon-de-Provence. During the Franco-Prussian war, he was a lieutenant of militia. 
His 1875 painting of "The Flood at Toulouse" attracted huge attention, and it is now in the Havre Museum. All of his early work was romantic style, but was influenced by other styles including Bolognese and Gustave Courbet. In 1877 he exhibited "Fete of Silenus" at Salon, which is now at the Ghent Museum. It was at this point Roll decided to devote his work to painting everyday life, and his style changed as well to a more realist one. 
He began to paint portraits, and with his 1880 painting "Miners' Strike", he became one of France's highest ranked painters of the day; he was extremely successful for the rest of his working life. He became the French government's official painter, and was commissioned to paint numerous art pieces, including those of murals, ceilings, and other building decoration. "President Carnot at Versailles at the Centenary of the Etats Generaux", now at Versailles Palace, and "The Tzar and President Faure laying the Foundation Stone of the Alexandre III. Bridge" are two such paintings, and "The Pleasures of Life" and "The Rosetime of Youth" were both for the Hotel de Ville. Many of his paintings are in public art galleries, including the Hotel de Ville museum, the Cognac Museum, Avignon Museum, Laval Museum, Fontainebleau Palace, Pau Museum, and the Museum of Geneva. In 1905 he became the president of the Societe Nationale des Beaux-Arts, which he co-founded. Jules Ernest Renoux was one of his pupils.
In the 1880s Roll "discovered" the Bordeaux artist Alfred Smith, a painter in the style of Courbet and Corot, promoting Smith's work and helping him in his career.

She was also the 7th-oldest living person in the world, at time of death, and the oldest verified living person in Europe.
Dighero-Zolezzi died of ischemia on 28 December 2005.
Venere Pizzinato.
Venere Pizzinato (23 November 1896 – 2 August 2011) was an Italian supercentenarian who was the oldest verified person from Italy, living to the age of 114 years, 252 days. She became one of the ten oldest living people in March 2010. Pizzinato was also the oldest person ever to have been born in the Austrian-Hungarian empire. At the time of her death, Pizzinato was the 3rd oldest living person in the world, one of the 10 oldest Europeans ever, and one of the 40 oldest people ever verified in world history. At the time of her death she was the oldest person ever from Italy, a title she held until 13 December 2011 when she was surpassed by Dina Manfredini.

Franciszek and Magdalena Banasiewicz

The family of Franciszek and Magdalena Banasiewicz with sons: Jerzy, Tadeusz, Antoni, and daughter Maria lived on a farm in Orzechowce near Przemyśl during the Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II. In July 1991 they were bestowed the titles of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem for rescuing fifteen Jews escaping the Holocaust from the ghetto in Przemyśl.
Franciszek Banasiewicz (2 April 1884 – 5 February 1954) was a decorative painter before the war. His wife Magdalena née Lenar (7 July 1884 – 28 September 1957) was a homemaker. Two Banasiewicz sons, Antoni and Tadeusz, were sent by the Nazi Germans to forced labour in the Third Reich when the war broke out. Tadeusz escaped and after returning home lived in hiding in barns and in the fields. His father, Franciszek, organised many heroic rescue missions with his aid.
Initially, Franciszek Banasiewicz was approached by Salomon Ehrenfreud, who escaped the ghetto massacre of June 1942 having witnessed the death of his wife and children. He was hiding at the home of Jan Kościak a bit earlier. Tadeusz—already staying out of sight—took it upon himself to hide along with Salomon around the farm. Meanwhile, Franciszek started taking in other Jews including Salomon's brother, Izaak—previously helped by other Poles—his cousin Jakub Nassan and their friends Marcel Teich and Junek Frenkiel. Helped by his own son, Franciszek brought from the ghetto Nassan's wife, Eugenia and her friend Fejga Weidenbaum. A week later he rescued Edmund Orner. 
The bunker.
Banasiewicz family and the fugitives began constructing a bunker under the house in the fall of 1943 in preparation for the cold Polish winter. The new hiding area enabled Banasiewiczs to rescue more people. In October 1943, on request of Salomon Ehrenfreud, Tadeusz smuggled out from the ghetto Bunia Stamhofer and Fela Szattner, then in January 1944, he rescued Samuel Reinharz with his brother Beniamin and their mother Bertha. He attempted to rescue Jozef Weindling, however, Jozef's brother, a ghetto policeman, arrested Tadeusz at that time, and passed him over to the Nazis. The German commander released him nonetheless, bribed by Samuel Reinharz, who then escaped with Tadeusz and Jozef back to the farm where all fifteen Jews were hiding.
Maria Banasiewicz recalls how shocked though undeterred they were to learn that, in the nearby village of Tarnawce, farmer Kurpiel who sheltered 27 Jews in a bunker similar to theirs was discovered in May 1944. All fugitives were murdered. Kurpiel with his wife and family was executed in Lipowica. Several months earlier, a similar fate met Banasiewiczs liaison with the Ghetto, Michał Kruk. He was executed on 6 September 1943, during the first public execution in Przemyśl, along with several other people punished by death for the assistance they had rendered to the Jews. 
In Przemyśl: 15,210 Jews lost their lives during the Holocaust, including 568 non-Jewish Poles killed because they were attempting to save them. Only 675 Jews remained, among them 415 Jews saved directly in the town including 60 children. — Leszek M. Włodek 
In May 1944 German gendarmes came to recapture one of the Banasiewicz sons. They surrounded the house, but were unsuccessful. The bunker was not discovered either. The Red Army retook the town from German forces on July 27, 1944. All family members and Jewish escapees survived. In 1988 (or, on July 17, 1991, sources vary) the Banasiewicz family including Franciszek, Magdalena, Maria, Tadeusz and Jerzy were given the titles of Righteous among the Nations for their heroic stance against the Nazi German Holocaust.

<doc id="19690815" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19690815" title="Celtic deities">
Celtic deities

The gods and goddesses of the pre-Christian Celtic peoples are known from a variety of sources, including written Celtic mythology, ancient places of worship, statues, engravings, cult objects and place or personal names.
The "locus classicus" for the Celtic gods of Gaul is the passage in Julius Caesar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico" ("The Gallic War", 52–51 BC) in which he names six of them, together with their functions. He says that Mercury was the most honoured of all the gods and many images of him were to be found. Mercury was regarded as the inventor of all the arts, the patron of travellers and of merchants, and the most powerful god in matters of commerce and gain. After him, the Gauls honoured Apollo, who drove away diseases, Mars, who controlled war, Jupiter, who ruled the heavens, and Minerva, who promoted handicrafts. He adds that the Gauls regarded Dis Pater as their ancestor.
In characteristic Roman fashion, Caesar does not refer to these figures by their native names but by the names of the Roman gods with which he equated them, a procedure that greatly complicates the task of identifying his Gaulish deities with their counterparts in the insular literatures. He also presents a neat schematic equation of god and function that is quite foreign to the vernacular literary testimony. Yet, given its limitations, his brief catalog is a valuable witness. 
The gods named by Caesar are well-attested in the later epigraphic record of Gaul and Britain. Not infrequently, their names are coupled with native Celtic theonyms and epithets, such as Mercury Visucius, Lenus Mars, Jupiter Poeninus, or Sulis Minerva. Unsyncretised theonyms are also widespread, particularly among goddesses such as Sulevia, Sirona, Rosmerta, and Epona. In all, several hundred names containing a Celtic element are attested in Gaul. The majority occur only once, which has led some scholars to conclude that the Celtic gods and their cults were local and tribal rather than national. Supporters of this view cite Lucan's mention of a god called Teutates, which they interpret as "god of the tribe" (it is thought that "teuta-" meant "tribe" in Celtic). The multiplicity of deity names may also be explained otherwise – many, for example, may be simply epithets applied to major deities by widely extended cults.
General characteristics.
Evidence from the Roman period presents a wide array of gods and goddesses who are represented by images or inscribed dedications. Certain deities were venerated widely across the Celtic world, while others were limited only to a single religion or even to a specific locality. Certain local or regional deities might have greater popularity within their spheres than supra-regional deities. For example, in east-central Gaul, the local Burgundian healing goddess Sequana was probably more influential in the minds of her local devotees than the Matres, who were worshipped all over Britain, Gaul and the Rhineland.
Supra-regional cults.
Among the divinities transcending tribal boundaries were the Matres, Cernunnos, the sky-god and Epona, the horse-goddess, who was invoked by devotees living as far apart as Britain, Rome and Bulgaria. A distinctive feature of the mother-goddesses was their frequent depiction as a triad in many parts of Britain, in Gaul and on the Rhine, although it is possible to identify strong regional differences within this group. 
The Celtic sky-god too had variations in the way he was perceived and his cult expressed. Yet the link between the Celtic Jupiter and the solar wheel is maintained over a wide area, from Hadrian's Wall to Cologne and Nîmes.
Local cults.
It is sometimes possible to identify regional, tribal, or sub-tribal divinities. Specific to the Remi of northwest Gaul is a distinctive group of stone carvings depicting a triple-faced god with shared facial features and luxuriant beards. In the Iron Age, this same tribe issued coins with three faces, a motif found elsewhere is Gaul. Another tribal god was Lenus, venerated by the Treveri. He was worshipped at a number of Treveran sanctuaries, the most splendid of which was at the tribal capital of Trier itself. Yet he was also exported to other areas: Lenus has altars set up to him in Chedworth in Gloucestershire and Caerwent in Wales.
Many Celtic divinities were extremely localised, sometimes occurring in just one shrine, perhaps because the spirit concerned was a "genius loci," the governing spirit of a particular place. In Gaul, over four hundred different Celtic god-names are recorded, of which at least 300 occur just once. Sequana was confined to her spring shrine near Dijon, Sulis belonged to Bath. The divine couple Ucuetis and Bergusia were worshipped solely at Alesia in Burgundy. The British god Nodens is associated above all with the great sanctuary at Lydney (though he also appears at Cockersand Moss in Cumbria). Two other British deities, Cocidius and Belatucadrus, were both Martial gods and were each worshipped in clearly defined territories in the area of Hadrian’s Wall. There are many other gods whose names may betray origins as topographical spirits. Vosegus presided over the mountains of the Vosges, Luxovius over the spa-settlement of Luxeuil and Vasio over the town of Vaison in the Lower Rhône Valley.
Divine couples.
One notable feature of Gaulish and Romano-Celtic sculpture is the frequent appearance of male and female deities in pairs, such as Rosmerta and ‘Mercury’, Nantosuelta and Sucellos, Sirona and Apollo Grannus, Borvo and Damona, or Mars Loucetius and Nemetona.
Notable deity types.
Antlered gods.
A recurrent figure in Gaulish iconography is a cross-legged deity with antlers, sometimes surrounded by animals, often wearing or holding a torc. The name usually applied to him, Cernunnos, is attested only a few times, on a relief at Notre Dame de Paris (currently reading ERNUNNOS, but an early sketch shows it as having read CERNUNNOS in the 18th century), an inscription from Montagnac (αλλετ[ει]υος καρνονου αλ[ι]σο[ντ]εας, "Alleteinos this to Karnonos of Alisontia"), and a pair of identical inscriptions from Seinsel-Rëlent ("Deo Ceruninco"). Figured representations of this sort of deity, however, are widespread; the earliest known was found at Val Camonica in northern Italy, while the most famous is plate A of the Gundestrup Cauldron, a 1st-century BC vessel found in Denmark. On the Gundestrup Cauldron and sometimes elsewhere, Cernunnos, or similar figure, is accompanied by a ram-headed serpent. At Reims, the figure is depicted with a cornucopia overflowing with grains or coins.
Healing deities.
Healing deities are known from many parts of the Celtic world; they frequently have associations with thermal springs, healing wells, herbalism and light. 
Brighid, the triple goddess of healing, poetry and smithcraft is perhaps the most well-known of the Insular Celtic deities of healing. She is associated with many healing springs and wells. A lesser-known Irish healing goddess is Airmed, also associated with a healing well and with the healing art of herbalism. 
In Romano-Celtic tradition Belenus (possibly from Celtic: "*belen-" ‘bright’, though other etymologies have been convincingly proposed) is found chiefly in southern France and northern Italy. Apollo Grannus, though concentrated in central and eastern Gaul, also “occurs associated with medicinal waters in Brittany [...] and far away in the Danube Basin”. Grannus's companion is frequently the goddess Sirona. Another important Celtic deity of healing is Bormo/Borvo, particularly associated with thermal springs such as Bourbonne-les-Bains and Bourbon-Lancy. Such hot springs were (and often still are) believed to have therapeutic value. Green interprets the name Borvo to mean “seething, bubbling or boiling spring water”.
Goddesses of sacred waters.
In Ireland, there are numerous holy wells dedicated to the goddess Brighid. There are dedications to ‘Minerva’ in Britain and throughout the Celtic areas of the Continent. At Bath Minerva was identified with the goddess Sulis, whose cult there centred on the thermal springs. 
Other goddesses were also associated with sacred springs, such as Icovellauna among the Treveri and Coventina at Carrawburgh. Damona and Bormana also serve this function in companionship with the spring-god Borvo (see above). 
A number of goddesses were deified rivers, notably Boann (of the River Boyne), Sinann (the River Shannon), Sequana (the deified Seine), Matrona (the Marne), Souconna (the deified Saône) and perhaps Belisama (the Ribble).
While the most well-known deity of the sea is the god Manannán, possible early Irish sea goddesses include Fand, her sister Lí Ban, and the mother-goddess of the Fomorians, Domnu.
Goddesses of horses.
The horse, an instrument of Indo-European expansion, plays a part in all the mythologies of the various Celtic cultures. The cult of the Gaulish horse goddess Epona was widespread. Adopted by the Roman cavalry, it spread throughout much of Europe, even to Rome itself. She seems to be the embodiment of "horse power" or horsemanship, which was likely perceived as a power vital for the success and protection of the tribe. She has insular analogues in the Welsh Rhiannon and in the Irish Édaín Echraidhe (echraidhe, "horse riding") and Macha, who outran the fastest steeds.
The Irish horse goddess Macha, perhaps a threefold goddess herself, is associated with battle and sovereignty. Though a goddess in her own right, she is also considered to be part of the triple goddess of battle and slaughter, the Morrígan. Other faces of the Morrígan were Badhbh Catha and Nemain.
Mother goddesses.
Mother goddesses are a recurrent feature in Celtic religions. The epigraphic record reveals many dedications to the Matres or Matronae, which are particularly prolific around Cologne in the Rhineland. Iconographically, Celtic mothers may appear singly or, quite often, triply; they usually hold fruit or "cornucopiae" or "paterae"; they may also be full-breasted (or many-breasted) figures nursing infants.
Welsh and Irish tradition preserve a number of mother figures such as the Welsh Dôn, Rhiannon (‘great queen’) and Modron (from Matrona, ‘great mother’), and the Irish Danu, Boand, Macha and Ernmas. However, all of these fulfill many roles in the mythology and symbolism of the Celts, and cannot be limited only to motherhood. In many of their tales, their having children is only mentioned in passing, and is not a central facet of their identity. "Mother" Goddesses may also be Goddesses of warfare and slaughter, or of healing and smithcraft.
Mother goddesses were at times symbols of sovereignty, creativity, birth, fertility, sexual union and nurturing. At other times they could be seen as punishers and destroyers: their offspring may be helpful or dangerous to the community, and the circumstances of their birth may lead to curses, "geasa" or hardship, such as in the case of Macha's curse of the Ulstermen or Rhiannon's possible devouring of her child and subsequent punishment.
Cult of Lugh.
According to Caesar the god most honoured by the Gauls was ‘Mercury’, and this is confirmed by numerous images and inscriptions. Mercury's name is often coupled with Celtic epithets, particularly in eastern and central Gaul; the commonest such names include Visucius, Cissonius, and Gebrinius. Another name, Lugus, is inferred from the recurrent place-name "Lugdunon" ('the fort of Lugus') from which the modern Lyon, Laon, and Loudun in France and Leiden in The Netherlands derive their names; a similar element can be found in Carlisle (formerly Castra Luguvallium), Legnica in Poland and the county Louth in Ireland, derived from the Irish "Lú", itself coming from "Lugh". The Irish and Welsh cognates of Lugus are Lugh and Lleu, respectively, and certain traditions concerning these figures mesh neatly with those of the Gaulish god. Caesar's description of the latter as "the inventor of all the arts" might almost have been a paraphrase of Lugh's conventional epithet "samildánach" ("possessed of many talents"), while Lleu is addressed as "master of the twenty crafts" in the "Mabinogi". An episode in the Irish tale of the Battle of Magh Tuireadh is a dramatic exposition of Lugh's claim to be master of all the arts and crafts. Inscriptions in Spain and Switzerland, one of them from a guild of shoemakers, are dedicated to Lugoves, widely interpreted as a plural of Lugus perhaps referring to the god conceived in triple form. 
The Gaulish Mercury often seems to function as a god of sovereignty. Gaulish depictions of Mercury sometimes show him bearded and/or with wings or horns emerging directly from his head, rather than from a winged hat. Both these characteristics are unusual for the classical god. More conventionally, the Gaulish Mercury is usually shown accompanied by a ram and/or a rooster, and carrying a caduceus; his depiction at times is very classical.
Lugh is said to have instituted the festival of Lughnasadh, celebrated on 1 August, in commemoration of his foster-mother Tailtiu.
In Gaulish monuments and inscriptions, Mercury is very often accompanied by Rosmerta, whom Miranda Green interprets to be a goddess of fertility and prosperity. Green also notices that the Celtic Mercury frequently accompanies the Deae Matres (see below).
Cult of Taranis.
The Gaulish Jupiter is often depicted with a thunderbolt in one hand and a distinctive wheel in the other. Scholars frequently identify this wheel/sky god with Taranis, who is mentioned by Lucan. The name Taranis may be cognate with those of Taran, a minor figure in Welsh mythology, and Turenn, the father of the 'three gods of Dana' in Irish mythology.
Cult of Toutatis.
Teutates, also spelled Toutatis (Celtic: "(He of the tribe"), was one of three Celtic gods mentioned by the Roman poet Lucan in the 1st century, the other two being Esus ("lord") and Taranis ("thunderer"). According to later commentators, victims sacrificed to Teutates were killed by being plunged headfirst into a vat filled with an unspecified liquid. Present-day scholars frequently speak of ‘the "toutates"’ as plural, referring respectively to the patrons of the several tribes.
Of two later commentators on Lucan's text, one identifies Teutates with Mercury, the other with Mars. He is also known from dedications in Britain, where his name was written Toutatis.
Paul-Marie Duval, who considers the Gaulish Mars a syncretism with the Celtic "toutates", notes that:
Cult of Esus.
Esus appears in two monumental statues as an axeman cutting branches from trees.
Gods with hammers.
Sucellos, the 'good striker' is usually portrayed as a middle-aged bearded man, with a long-handled hammer, or perhaps a beer barrel suspended from a pole. His companion, Nantosuelta, is sometimes depicted alongside him. When together, they are accompanied by symbols associated with prosperity and domesticity. This figure is often identified with Silvanus, worshipped in southern Gaul under similar attributes; Dis Pater, from whom, according to Caesar, all the Gauls believed themselves to be descended; and the Irish Dagda, the 'good god', who possessed a cauldron that was never empty and a huge club.
Gods of strength and eloquence.
A club-wielding god identified as Ogmios is readily observed in Gaulish iconography.
In Gaul, he was identified with the Roman Hercules. He was portrayed as an old man with swarthy skin and armed with a bow and club. He was also a god of eloquence, and in that aspect he was represented as drawing along a company of men whose ears were chained to his tongue. 
Ogmios' Irish equivalent was Ogma, who was impressively portrayed as a swarthy man whose battle ardour was so great that he had to be controlled by chains held by other warriors until the right moment. Ogham script, an Irish writing system dating from the 4th century AD, was said to have been invented by him.
The divine bull.
Another prominent zoomorphic deity type is the divine bull. Tarvos Trigaranus ("bull with three cranes") is pictured on reliefs from the cathedral at Trier, Germany, and at Notre-Dame de Paris. In Irish literature, the Donn Cuailnge ("Brown Bull of Cooley") plays a central role in the epic "Táin Bó Cuailnge" ("The Cattle-Raid of Cooley").
The ram-headed snake.
A distinctive ram-headed snake accompanies Gaulish gods in a number of representations, including the horned god from the Gundestrup cauldron, Mercury, and Mars.
Table.
This table shows some of the Celtic and Romano-Celtic gods and goddesses mentioned above, in Romanized form as well as ancient Gaulish, British or Iberian names as well as those of the Tuatha Dé Danann and characters from the "Mabinogion". They are arranged so as to suggest some linguistic or functional associations among the ancient gods and literary figures; needless to say, all such associations are subject to continual scholarly revision and disagreement. In particular, it has been noted by scholars such as Sjoestedt that it is inappropriate to try to fit Insular Celtic deities into a Roman format as such attempts seriously distort the Insular deities.

Paracetamol toxicity

Paracetamol toxicity is caused by excessive use or overdose of the analgesic drug paracetamol (called acetaminophen in North America). Mainly causing liver injury, paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure.
Many individuals with paracetamol toxicity may have no symptoms at all in the first 24 hours following overdose. Others may initially have nonspecific complaints such as vague abdominal pain and nausea. With progressive disease, signs of liver failure may develop; these include low blood sugar, low blood pH, easy bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy. Some will spontaneously resolve, although untreated cases may result in death.
Damage to the liver, or hepatotoxicity, results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, "N"-acetyl-"p"-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI)(also known as N-acetylimidoquinone). NAPQI depletes the liver's natural antioxidant glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver, leading to liver failure. Risk factors for toxicity include excessive chronic alcohol intake, fasting or anorexia nervosa, and the use of certain drugs such as isoniazid.
Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replacing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the patient presents for treatment soon after the overdose; the antidote acetylcysteine acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent damage to the liver. N-acetylcysteine can neutralize NAPQI by itself as well. A liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. Patients treated early have a good prognosis, whereas patients that develop major liver abnormalities typically have a poor outcome. Efforts to prevent paracetamol overdose include limiting individual sales of the drug and combining paracetamol with methionine, which is converted into glutathione in the liver.
Toxicity.
The toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceeds these levels. Following a normal dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children. Intravenous doses should be smaller than those taken orally, all other things being equal.
In rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use. This may be due to individual ("idiosyncratic") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamol's metabolism).
Signs and symptoms.
The signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, pallor, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.
The second phase occurs between 24 and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in hepatocytes as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant pain. The increasing liver damage also alters biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the hepatic transaminases alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.
The third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive hepatic necrosis leading to fulminant hepatic failure with complications of coagulation defects, hypoglycemia, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third phase is survived, the hepatic necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.
Pathophysiology.
When taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe. Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via Phase II metabolism by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide, with a small portion being oxidized via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Cytochromes and 3A4 convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly-reactive intermediary metabolite, "N"-acetyl-"p"-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.
In cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute hepatic necrosis. In animal studies, hepatic glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before hepatotoxicity occurs.
Risk factors.
A number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.
Fasting is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of hepatic glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.
Diagnosis.
The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.
Clinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of hepatic necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.
Detection in body fluids.
Paracetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. Plasma concentrations during therapy usually range from 2–20 mg/L, whereas levels of 30–300 mg/L are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.
Prevention.
Combination with Other Agents.
One strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote.
Paradote is a tablet sold in the UK which combines 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg methionine, an amino acid formerly used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.
There have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.
Calcitriol, the active metabolite of vitamin D3, appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production. Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration, it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration. It's proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.
Limitation of Availability.
Limiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively. Subsequent study suggests that these interventions have had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.
One suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, only 0.08% of the UK population present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.
Acetaminophen Replacements.
Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic precursors of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The glutathione hepatic values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in no-treated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of gluthathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.
Other.
Reducing publicity about paracetamol and the inclusion of warnings on packs of paracetamol have also been suggested as strategies to reduce overdose.
Treatment.
Gastric decontamination.
In adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.
It appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with activated charcoal.
Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac has no role in paracetamol overdose because the vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.
Acetylcysteine.
Acetylcysteine, also called "N"-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce paracetamol toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione react with the toxic NAPQI metabolite so that it does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certaininy in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine has been shown to be a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.
If the patient presents less than eight hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly reduces the risk of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8 hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute hepatic necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48 hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.
In United States practice, intravenous (IV) and oral administration are considered to be equally effective and safe if given within 8 hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140 mg/kg loading dose followed by 70 mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeat doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.
Intravenous acetylcysteine is given as a continuous infusion over 20 hours for a total dose 300 mg/kg. Recommended administration involves infusion of a 150 mg/kg loading dose over 15 to 60 minutes, followed by a 50 mg/kg infusion over four hours; the last 100 mg/kg are infused over the remaining 16 hours of the protocol. Intravenous acetylcysteine has the advantage of shortening hospital stay, increasing both doctor and patient convenience, and allowing administration of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of both the paracetamol and any co-ingested drugs without concerns about interference with oral acetylcysteine. Intravenous dosing varies with weight, specifically in children. For patients less than 20 kg, the loading dose is 150 mg/kg in 3 mL/kg diluent, administered over 60 minutes; the second dose is 50 mg/kg in 7 mL/kg diluent over 4 hours; and the third and final dose is 100 mg/kg in 14 mL/kg diluent over 16 hours.
The most common adverse effect to acetylcysteine treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions are more common in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in 4 to 23% of patients. Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma. If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or slowed and antihistamines and other supportive care is administered.
Liver transplant.
In patients who develop fulminant hepatic failure or who are otherwise expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant was developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300 mmol/L In a 24 hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques have the advantage of supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are discontinued and they avoid taking immunosuppressive medication for the rest of their lives.
Prognosis.
The mortality rate from paracetamol overdose increases two days after the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidemia is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A mortality rate of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency, grade 3 or worse hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level. One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.
Epidemiology.
Paracetamol is contained in many preparations, available as both over-the-counter and as prescription-only medications. Because of its wide availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) there is a much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the most common cause of drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure.
In England and Wales an estimated 41,200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%. It is estimated that 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur as a result of poisoning each year in England and Wales. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults, and 25% of cases in children.

Cadmium telluride photovoltaics

Cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics describes a photovoltaic (PV) technology that is based on the use of cadmium telluride thin film, a semiconductor layer designed to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity. Cadmium telluride PV is the only thin film photovoltaic technology to surpass crystalline silicon PV in cheapness for a significant portion of the PV market, namely in multi-kilowatt systems. CdTe PV is considered the ecologically leading technology as it provides a solution to key ecological issues including climate change, energy security, and water scarcity. It is also considered the most eco-efficient current PV technology when comparing a range of application scenarios e.g. commercial rooftop applications or large scale ground mount applications. On a life cycle basis, CdTe PV has the smallest carbon footprint, lowest water use, and fastest energy payback time of all solar technologies. A fast energy payback time enables PV to scale with faster carbon reductions without causing short-term energy deficits.
Background.
Since inception, the dominant solar cell technology in the marketplace has been based on wafers of crystalline silicon. During the same period, the idea of developing alternative, lower cost PV technologies led to the consideration of thin films and concentrators. Thin films are based on using thinner semiconductor layers to absorb and convert sunlight; concentrators, on the idea of replacing expensive semiconductors with lenses or mirrors. Both reduce cost, in theory, by reducing the use of semiconductor material. However, both faced critical challenges.
The first thin film technology to be extensively developed and manufactured was amorphous silicon. However, this technology suffers from low efficiencies and slow deposition rates (leading to high capital costs) and has not become a market leader. Instead, the PV market has grown to almost 4 gigawatts with wafer-based crystalline silicon comprising almost 90% of sales. Installation trails production by a slight time lag, and the same source estimates about 3 gigawatts were installed in 2007.
During this period, two other thin films continued in development (cadmium telluride, and copper indium diselenide or CIS-alloys). The latter is beginning to be produced in start-up volumes of 1–30 megawatts per year by individual companies and remains an unproven, but promising market competitor due to very high, small-area cell efficiencies approaching 20% in the laboratory. CdTe cell efficiency is also approaching 20% in the laboratory with a world record of 19.6% as of 2013.
History.
Research in CdTe dates back to the 1950s, because it was quickly identified as having a band gap (about 1.5 eV) almost perfectly matched to the distribution of photons in the solar spectrum in terms of optimal conversion to electricity. A simple heterojunction design evolved in which p-type CdTe was matched with n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS). The cell was completed by adding top and bottom contacts. Early leaders in CdS/CdTe cell efficiencies were GE in the 1960s, and then Kodak, Monosolar, Matsushita, and AMETEK.
By 1981, Kodak used close spaced sublimation (CSS) and made the first 10% cells and first multi-cell devices (12 cells, 8% efficiency, 30 cm2). Monosolar and AMETEK used electrodeposition, a popular early method. Matsushita started with screen printing but shifted in the 1990s to CSS. Cells of about 10% sunlight-to-electricity efficiency were being made by the early 1980s at Kodak, Matsushita, Monosolar, and Ametek.
An important step forward occurred when cells were being scaled-up in size to make larger area products called modules. These products require higher currents than small cells and it was found that an additional layer, called a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), could facilitate the movement of current across the top of the cell (instead of a metal grid). One such TCO, tin oxide, was already being applied to glass for other uses (thermally reflective windows). Made more conductive for PV, tin oxide became and remains the norm in CdTe PV modules.
Professor Ting L. Chu of Southern Methodist University and subsequently of University of South Florida, Tampa, made significant contributions to moving the efficiency of CdTe cells to above 15% in 1992, a critical level of success in terms of potential commercial competitiveness. This was done when he added an intervening or buffer layer to the TCO/CdS/CdTe stack and then thinned the CdS to allow more light through. Chu used resistive tin oxide as the buffer layer and then thinned the CdS from several micrometres to under half a micrometre in thickness. Thick CdS, as it was used in prior devices, blocked about 5 mA/cm2 of light, or about 20% of the light usable by a CdTe device. By removing this loss while maintaining the other properties of the device, Chu reached 15% efficiency in 1991, the first thin film to do so, as verified at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory(NREL). Chu used CSS for depositing the CdTe. For his achievements in taking CdTe from its status as “also-ran” to a primary candidate for commercialization, some think of Ting L. Chu as the key technologist in the history of CdTe development.
In the early 1990s, another set of entrants were active in CdTe commercial development, but with mixed results. A short-lived company, Golden Photon replaced Photon Energy, when it was bought by the Coors Company in 1992. Golden Photon, led by Scot Albright and John Jordan, actually held the record for a short period for the best CdTe module measured at NREL at 7.7% using a spray deposition technique. Meanwhile Matsushita, BP Solar, and Solar Cells Inc. were active. Matsushita claimed an 11% module efficiency using CSS and then dropped out of the technology. A similar efficiency and fate eventually occurred at BP Solar. BP used electrodeposition inherited from Monosolar by a circuitous route when it purchased SOHIO. SOHIO had previously bought Monosolar. BP Solar however never made a complete commitment to their CdTe technology despite its achievements and dropped it in the early 2000s. Another ineffective corporate evolution occurred at a European entrant, Antec. Founded by CdTe pioneer Dieter Bonnet (who made cells in the 1960s), Antec was able to make about 7%-efficient modules, but went bankrupt when it started producing commercially during a short, sharp downturn in the market in 2002. Purchased from bankruptcy, it never regained the technical traction needed to make further progress. However, as of 2008 Antec does make and sell CdTe PV modules.
There are a number of start-ups in CdTe today: Q-Cells' Calyxo (Germany), GE’s PrimeStar Solar (Arvada, Colorado), Arendi (Italy), and Abound Solar (Fort Collins, Colorado). Including Antec, their total production represents less than 70 megawatts per year.
In February 2009, Roth & Rau announced to develop turnkey CdTe production lines and launch the business before end of 2009.
There has been a lot of research on fabricating CdTe cells on flexible substrate since 1999. In 2009, EMPA, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research, demonstrated a 12.4% efficient solar cell on flexible polyimide substrate.
SCI and First Solar.
The major commercial success to emerge from the turmoil of the 1990s was Solar Cells Incorporated (SCI). Founded in 1999 as an outgrowth of a prior company, Glasstech Solar (founded 1984), led by inventor/entrepreneur Harold McMaster, it switched from amorphous silicon to CdTe as a better alternative to the higher-cost crystalline silicon PV. McMaster championed CdTe for its high-rate, high-throughput processing. Technical leadership came from a team that included Jim Nolan, Rick Powell, Jim Foote, and Peter Meyers, with consulting help from Ting Chu and Al Compaan (U. Toledo). SCI started with an adaptation of the CSS method then shifted to a vapor transport approach, inspired by Powell. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart. John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Mike Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar.
In its early years First Solar suffered setbacks, and initial module efficiencies were modest, about 7%. Commercial product became available in 2002. But production did not reach 25 megawatts until 2005. The company built an additional line in Perrysburg, Ohio, then four lines in Germany, supported by the then substantial German production incentives (about 50% of capital costs). In 2006 First Solar reached 75 MW of annual production and announced a further 16 lines in Malaysia. The more recently announced lines have been operational ahead of schedule. As of 2013, First Solar has approximately 2 GW in annual production capacity and over 8 GW installed worldwide. First Solar is the world’s largest thin-film PV solar module manufacturer and one of the largest PV module manufacturers in the world.
GE announced plans to spend $600 million on a new plant and enter this market 
Technology.
Cell efficiency.
Recently, First Solar, Inc. and GE/Primestar have made a series of advances in research cell efficiencies with the most recent record being made in 2013 at 19.6%. In 2013, the record module efficiency was 16.1%. First Solar’s record-breaking module efficiency marks a substantial increase from the 14.4% record of the previous year. These achievements demonstrate that CdTe’s efficiency potential is far from saturated. By 2017, average production line module efficiency for CdTe PV is projected to be 17%. Since CdTe has the optimal band gap for single-junction devices, it may be expected that efficiencies close to exceeding 20% (such as already shown in CIS alloys) should be achievable in practical CdTe cells.
Process optimization.
Process optimization allows greater throughput at smaller cost. Typical improvements are broader substrates (since capital costs scale sublinearly, and installation costs can be reduced), thinner layers (to save material, electricity, and throughput time), and better material utilization (to save material and cleaning costs). Making components rather than buying them is also a traditional way for great manufacturers to save costs. Today’s CdTe module costs are about $72/m2 (normalized to a square meter). Costs are expected to reduce to $65/m2.
Thus a practical, long-term (10–year) goal for CdTe modules resulting from combining cost and efficiency goals would be $65 per 150 watts, or about $0.4 per watt. With commodity-like margins and combined with balance-of-system (BOS) costs, installed systems near $1.5/W seem achievable. With Southern California sunlight, this would be in the 6 to 8 US cents per kWh range (e.g., based on economic and other assumptions used in algorithms such as in the United States Department of Energy and NREL's Solar Advisory Model).
Performance advantage.
Although typical crystalline silicon modules have an efficiency of 13%-20% and CdTe modules have an efficiency of approximately 13%, recent modules produced at First Solar and measured by NREL have shown CdTe modules with efficiencies at 16.1%. Module efficiencies are obtained in laboratories at standard testing temperatures of 25°C, however in the field modules are often exposed to much higher temperatures. CdTe PV modules have a proven performance advantage over conventional silicon modules in high temperature climates due to CdTe’s low temperature coefficient. Although all PV semiconductors experience performance losses at temperatures above 25°C,CdTe PV modules experience half the reduction of crystalline silicon modules, resulting in an increased annual energy output of 5-9%.
Solar tracking.
Almost all thin film photovoltaic module systems to-date have been non-solar tracking, because the output of modules has been too low to offset tracker capital and operating costs. But relatively inexpensive single-axis tracking systems can add 25% output per installed watt. In addition, depending on the Tracker Energy Gain, the overall eco-efficiency of the PV system can be enhanced by lowering both system costs and environmental impacts. This is climate-dependent. Tracking also produces a smoother output plateau around midday, allowing afternoon peaks to be met.
Cadmium.
Cadmium, a heavy metal considered a hazardous substance, is a waste byproduct of zinc refining therefore its production does not depend on PV market demand. CdTe PV modules provide a beneficial and safe use for cadmium that would otherwise be stored for future use or disposed of in landfills as hazardous waste. Mining byproducts can be converted into a stable CdTe compound and safely encapsulated inside CdTe PV solar modules that produce clean energy for 25+ years. A large growth in the CdTe PV sector has the potential to actually reduce, rather than increase, global cadmium emissions by displacing coal and oil power generation.
Safety.
In a validating test, Vasilis Fthenakis of the Brookhaven National Laboratory showed that the glass plates surrounding CdTe material sandwiched between them (as they are in all commercial modules) seal during a fire and do not allow any cadmium release. All other uses and exposures related to cadmium are minor and similar in kind and magnitude to exposures from other materials in the broader PV value chain, e.g., to toxic gases, lead solder, or solvents (most of which are not used in CdTe manufacturing).
Tellurium supply.
Questions have been raised over the scalability of CdTe PV and its potential of being constrained by the supply of tellurium. Tellurium production and reserves estimations are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty and vary considerably. Tellurium (Te) is an element that is primarily used as a machining additive to steel. The existing supply is almost exclusively obtained by recovering Te as a by-product of copper refining. Only a small amount, estimated to be about 800 metric tons per year, is available. According to USGS, global tellurium production in 2007 was 135 metric tons. Most of it comes as a by-product of copper, with smaller byproduct amounts from lead and gold. One gigawatt (GW) of CdTe PV modules would require about 93 metric tons (at current efficiencies and thicknesses), Through improved material efficiency and increased PV recycling systems, the CdTe PV industry has the potential to fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038. In the last decade, new supplies of tellurium-rich ores have been located, e.g., in Xinju, China as well as in Mexico and Sweden. Since CdTe is now regarded as an important technology in terms of PV’s future impact on global energy and environment, the issue of tellurium availability is significant. Recently, researchers have added an unusual twist – astrophysicists identify tellurium as the most abundant element in the universe with an atomic number over 40. This surpasses, e.g., heavier materials like tin, bismuth, and lead, which are common. Researchers have shown that well-known undersea ridges (which are now being evaluated for their economic recoverability) are rich in tellurium and by themselves could supply more tellurium than we could ever use for all of our global energy. It is not yet known that this undersea tellurium is recoverable, nor whether there is much more tellurium elsewhere that can be recovered.
Recycling.
With over 100 GW of solar PV modules installed worldwide, recycling is important to the whole PV sector in order to maximize resource recovery and manage environmentally sensitive materials (e.g. lead, selenium, and cadmium compounds) which are common in the industry. First Solar established the first global and comprehensive recycling program in the PV industry. Its proven and scalable recycling facilities are operational at each of First Solar’s manufacturing plants and recover up to 95% of semiconductor material for reuse in new modules and 90% of glass for reuse in new glass products.
Market viability.
Success of cadmium telluride PV has been due to the low cost achievable with the CdTe technology, made possible by combining adequate efficiency with lower module area costs. Direct manufacturing cost for CdTe PV modules reached $0.57 per watt in 2013, and capital cost per new watt of capacity is near $0.9 per watt (including land and buildings).
Notable systems.
Utility-scale CdTe PV solutions can deliver solar electricity that is competitive with peaking fossil fuel generation sources depending on irradiance levels, interest rates, and other factors such as development costs. Recent installations of large CdTe PV systems by First Solar confirm the competitiveness of CdTe PV with other forms of solar energy and how close it is to being competitive with conventional natural gas peakers:

The Last Lament

The Last Lament is the second album by the progressive metal group Called To Arms released through Tragic Hero Records on November 17, 2007. Originally intended to be a full length in 2005, the band went on hiatus and never finished writing the rest of the record. However, when the band became active again they decided that since the disc was already nearly 30 minutes in length it had enough substance to justify releasing the material as an EP upon their return.
Critical reception.
The Last Lament EP is a 28-minute trip through nearly every sub genre of metal that exists. From the grindcore parts of "The Last Lament" to the southern groove of "Locked and Loaded" to the old fashioned shred parts of "The Solace," these artists are not afraid to experiment. While Called To Arms doesn't reinvent technical metal, they are quite innovative in weaving together sounds and styles no one ever expected to hear together without sounding like completely random mishmash. In fact, the songs actually sound complete through impressive musicianship and songwriting. The heavy parts are heavy with plenty of odd time signature breakdowns, speed picking and blast beats; the metalcore riffage is plenty pit-worthy, the grooves get you moving; and the shred parts will melt plenty of scenester faces. Where Called To Arms stands out most however is during the softer moments with their melodic sensibilities reminiscent of Misery Signals but with a much broader emotional spectrum. I am excited to see what these guys can express within the scope and freedom of a full length release. (3.5/5)
...The Last Lament is not an album that has the possibility to save the metalcore genre, but how many really do? Instead, it's an album that's going to give us metalcore fans another dose of what keeps us listening. They've got pretty much everything we can appreciate: pummeling vocals, air-tight instrumentation, and a keen ear for placement and structuring...The instrumentation on this album is extremely tight and well-delivered. The guitarists can throw out some serious leads, and the songs are punctuated by some impressive soloing and scattered technical work...Called to Arms is going to be one of those bands to watch out for in the future, and while they may not ever be the saviors that this genre is looking for, it's likely that they're not going to disappoint fans of it. (7.7/10)

Country Houses Association

The Country Houses Association (CHA) was a British charity (a friendly society with charitable status) that converted country houses into retirement flats and maintained them from 1955 until its liquidation in 2004. 
History.
The Country Houses Association Ltd was an Industrial and Provident Society formed in 1955 by Rear Admiral Greathed, originally called the Mutual Households Association (MHA). Its stated aim was to preserve historic buildings for the benefit of the nation. During its lifetime, the Association acquired nine large country houses, and restored and preserved these until their sale in 2002-4. During their ownership by the Association, all the houses were converted into retirement apartments, with communal dining and drawing rooms, with the rental income helping to pay for the house's extensive renovations and repairs (residents also paid deposits of up to £140,000). The houses were open to members of the Association and also members of the public. Sir John Adye was the chair of the CHA from 1996 until 2002.
The Association finally went into liquidation in December 2003 with the liquidators being Deloitte & Touche. The Association stated it went into liquidation because of falling demand for its apartments, the increasing age-profile of residents and the increased regulation surrounding the business. The trustees were told they could not use charity funds to support loss-making businesses with no future prospects. 
At the time of its liquidation in 2003 the CHA owned 8 houses:
A 9th house, Greathed Manor near Dormansland in Surrey (originally called Ford Manor when designed by Robert Kerr, but changed in 1960 to Greathed Manor by the CHA in memory of its founder) had its long lease (commencing in 1959 from the Nichols family, descendants of the Spender-Clay family) sold in about 2002, at the beginning of the Association's financial troubles. In 2008 it was adapted into a nursing home. There was apparently also a 10th house run by the CHA. This may have been Otterden Place, Otterden, Faversham, Kent.
About 6 of the 8 houses were sold as "going concerns", so that most of the 180 residents could remain in their apartments. Out of the original 9 houses, 7 are still in use as retirement or nursing homes, with Aynhoe converted back into a single home in 200?.
Country Houses Foundation.
Following the sale of all the houses and the restructuring of the CHA in 2004, the Country Houses Foundation (CHF) was set up in 2005, and endowed with the surplus funds from the sale of the properties, which came to approximately £15 million. It is a charitable grant-giving foundation which supports the preservation of historic houses and gardens, with its Chairman currently being Norman Hudson.

Moussa Kaka

Moussa Kaka is a Nigerien radio journalist and director of Maradi based station Saraounia FM, as well as a correspondent for France's Radio France International. He has twice been arrested by the government of President Mamadou Tandja over his reporting. He is at the center of a 2008 court case by the Nigerien government over his 2007 interviews of Movement of Nigeriens for Justice (MNJ) rebels.
Journalistic career.
In 1993, Moussa became Niger correspondent for France's Radio France International. At that time he was a print journalist for the Niamey based independent newspaper Le Républicain-Niger. In 2002, Kaka was named news director Saraounia FM, a radio station in the Regional capitol of Maradi, where he had been employed since 2000. Niger has a strong radio press, as high illiteracy rates and low television broadcast coverage make it the dominant news medium for much of the nation. Despite instances of arrest and detention of journalists, West African observers generally judge Nigerien press to be independent and lively in attacking the government.
2002 arrest.
In 2002, Kaka was arrested for his reporting of a Nigerien Armed Forces mutiny in the regional capital of Diffa at the beginning of August 2002. On 23 August, Kaka was arrested and questioned at Niamey's Gendarmarie central headquarters In this instance he was released, along with several other print and electronic journalists, within days. The Nigerien government said that journalists were being investigated for breach of laws covering "the dissemination, by any communications means, of reports or allegations liable to cast doubt on national defence operations." Kaka was also singled out in a national statement by the government. A public television broadcast during the coup attempt called Kaka and managing editor of Le Républicain Mamane Abou "stateless persons" "working for the opposition".
2007-2008 arrest.
In early 2007, a Tuareg based insurgency began in the north of the country. Tensions with foreign press ensued, and journalists were banned from reporting from the northern Agadez Region in June 2007. Moussa Kaka, as Radio France International's correspondent, was especially effected. RFI was banned from reporting from or broadcasting in Niger in June, as the government claimed they were biased towards the rebels. Kaka publicly claimed that his life was threatened on 14 July by the head of the Nigerien Armed Forces General Moumouni Boureima at a reception at the home of the French Ambassador to Niger.
On 20 September 2007, Kaka was arrested after conducting three telephone interviews one of the leaders of the MNJ, during his work as Niger correspondent of Radio France International. The Government of Niger recorded these telephone conversations and arrested Kaka for "complicity in endangering the security of the state". These charges correspond to treason, and carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The initial charges were accepted but the State Prosecuting Magistrate for the Niamey Region on 16 November 2007 refused to accept taped conversations as evidence on grounds that they were obtained illegally. The Nigerien Supreme Court ruled in February 2008 that these tapes could be used as evidence. The Court further ruled that his rights were not breached by either the surveillance, the detention without trial, or the nature of the charges. On 23 June 2008, the prosecuting Magistrate ruled the Kaka could be provisionally released pending trial, a ruling that was immediately appealed by the government, meaning the defendant remained imprisoned. Exactly one month later, the Magistrate ordered that his office drop all charges against Kaka, a ruling which the government also immediately appealed. On 19 August, the Niamey Appeals Court overturned the Magistrate's decisions. In September 2008, the State Prosecuting Magistrate for the Niamey Region proposed that Kaka's charges again be dropped and instead he be charged with "a breach of national territorial integrity through an entente with MNJ rebels", a lesser charge, but one which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. On 7 October he was freed by the Niamey Magistrate's court provisionally while awaiting trial.
International campaign.
Kaka has been at the center of a campaign in France and elsewhere demanding his freedom, spearheaded by Radio France International and its CEO Alain de Pouzilhac, Reporters Without Borders (both organisations for which Kaka is Niger Correspondent) and Amnesty International, as well as Nigerien press groups including The Nigerien National Union of Press Workers (SYNATIC) and Le Republicain newspaper.
Other government actions.
While Kaka has received the longest imprisonment for a journalist since the beginning of the Tuareg based insurgency in February 2007, several other cases have come to the attention of the international media. French journalists Thomas Dandois and Pierre Creisson were detained in Agadez for a month in 2007 by Nigerien military forces before being released. The editor of the Niamey's L’Evénement weekly was arrested on 30 July 2008 and charged with “divulging a defence secret" after reporting that an army officer had been linked to an arms cache that was discovered in the capitol. The Government press regulation body, the High Council for Communication (CSC) closed Niamey based TV and radio station Dounia TV for one month in August 2008, and closed for an indefinite period Sahara FM, the main radio station in Agadez on 22 April 2008 for broadcasting interviews with people who had claimed they were the victims of abuses by government troops. In June 2007, Agadez weekly Aïr-Info was closed by the government for three months, while at the same time sending formal warnings to three other newspapers (Libération, L’Opinion and L’Evènement) for reporting on the conflict in the north, which the government said were “trying to justify criminal activity and violence.” Aïr-Info editor Ibrahim Manzo Diallo, after attempting to open a new weekly paper, was arrested and released. One of his reporters was also arrested in Ingal in October, and in October Diallo was arrested trying to board a flight to Europe and charged with "membership of a criminal gang" Diallo was released pending trial in February 2008.

Dharmavati

Dharmavati is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 59th "Melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Dhaamavati in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music. "Madhuvanti" is the nearest Hindustani music scale to "Dharmavati".
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 5th rāgam in the 10th "chakra Disi". The mnemonic name is "Disi-Ma". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ri gi mi pa dhi nu". Its structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras in Carnatic music" for details on below notation and terms):
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Gourimanohari", which is the 23rd "melakarta".
"Janya" rāgams.
"Dharmavati" has a few "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it, of which "Madhuvanti", "Ranjani" and "Vijayanagari" are popular in concerts. See "List of janya rāgams" for all rāgams associated with "Dharmavati".
Compositions.
Here are a few common compositions sung in concerts, set to "Dharmavati".
Notable film composers like Ilaiyaraja and later A. R. Rahman have composed film songs based on the scale of "Dharmavati". Ilaiyaraja composed songs such as 'Meendum Meedum Vaa' (Vikram), 'Andhela Ravamidhi', (Swarna Kamalam), 'Vaanaville' (Ramana), 'Nataraaja paadaalu' (Aalaapana) in this raaga while Rahman composed "Ottagathai Kattiko", in the 1993 Tamil film "Gentleman", based on the "Dharmavati" scale.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Dharmavati's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other "Melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Chakravakam" and "Sarasangi". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer "Graha bhedam on Dharmavati".

Copionodontinae

Copionodontinae is a subfamily of catfishes (order Siluriformes) of the family Trichomycteridae. It includes two genera, "Copionodon" and "Glaphyropoma". 
Classification.
Copionodontines are remarkably primitive in body form, and lack many of the synapomorphies that were previously used to diagnose the family Trichomycteridae. There is little doubt that the Copionodontinae forms a monophyletic group, diagnosed by several unambiguous synapomorphies, including a unique dentition composed of spatulate teeth not seen anywhere else in the Trichomycteridae. A few characters also support the genera "Copionodon" and "Glaphyropoma" as monophyletic subunits.
Distribution and ecology.
Copionodontines occur exclusively in the Chapada Diamantina; though the plateau is drained by four river basins, so far, these fish are exclusively found in drainages associated with the Paraguaçu River.
Copionodontines occupy the upper reaches of fast-flowing streams on rocky beds, often with tiny or no water flow in the dry season. Fish tend to concentrate on quiet deep pools, though some individuals lodge in narrow rock crevices in fast flowing sectors. Habitat preferences also vary according to species. Water in the upper reaches of the Chapada Diamantina is cool and usually black (tea-stained), but there are records of copionodontines in a few clear water streams as well. Usually they share their environment with few or no other fish species.

Pompilidotoxin

Pompilidotoxin is a toxin from the venom of spider wasps that slows the inactivation of Na+channels.
Etymology.
Pompilidotoxin is named after the pompilidae wasp family (commonly called spider wasps).
Source.
α-Pompilidotoxin (α-PMTX) can be extracted from the venom of a solitary wasp, "Anopolis samariensis". β-Pompilidotoxin (β-PMTX) originates from the venom of another wasp, "Batozonellus maculifrons".
Chemistry.
"Structure"
α-PMTX consists of 13 amino acid residues with the sequence Arg-Ile-Lys-Ile-Gly-Leu-Phe-Gln-Asp-Leu-Ser-Lys-Leu-NH2. 
Replacement of the lysine residue at position 12 of α-PMTX with arginine results in β-PMTX.
"Homology" 
α-PMTX has no structural homology with other toxins. It lacks disulfide bonds which are known to be present in other toxins acting on sodium channels, such as sea anemone toxins or scorpion toxins.
Target.
Both α- and β-PMTX slow the inactivation of neuronal sodium channels (but not heart sodium channels), possibly by binding to the neurotoxin receptor site 3 on the extracellular surface of the sodium channel.
β-PMTX has higher potency than α-PMTX.
Mode of action.
By slowing down the inactivation of sodium channels, PMTXs can potentiate synaptic transmission in the lobster neuromuscular endplate.
