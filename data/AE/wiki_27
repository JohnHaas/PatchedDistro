Rancho Solano Private Schools

Rancho Solano Preparatory School is an international learning community committed to educating, empowering and inspiring students from preschool to high school.
Campuses.
Rancho Solano has four campus locations. 
Curriculum.
RSPS focuses heavily on academic achievement. Entrance into all programs beyond preschool requires passing entrance tests. Class sizes tend to be small; at the largest of the campuses (Greenway) the student/teacher ratio is 11.3. The ratios at the other campuses are similar. One unique aspect of RSPS curriculum is the explicit focus on technology education.
Many of the students participate in the academic summer program offered at several of the campuses. These programs are open to outside students when capacity permits. Students engage in a variety of science and technology oriented activities. Many of the exercises also emphasize team-building and creativity. Developing the summer camp has been a major focus of RSPS in the last ten years.
Athletics.
RSPS participates in an athletic league with other local Arizona schools. Sports include football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, and soccer.
The high school is a full member of the Arizona Interscholastic Association.
Ownership.
RSPS was acquired by Meritas in 2007. Meritas is a for-profit Fort Lauderdale based company that owns private schools throughout the world, with campuses in Florida, Nevada, Texas, Switzerland, China, New York and Mexico. The most significant change that has accompanied the ownership transition has been the construction of a new 6-12 campus, Rancho Solano Preparatory School at Ventura in Scottsdale, Arizona.
High school.
RSPS started their first high school program in 2008, Rancho Solano Preparatory High School. It is the only private school in the greater Phoenix area to receive International Baccalaureate (IB) authorization.

Charles Isham

Sir Charles Edmund Isham, 10th Baronet (16 December 1819 - 7 April 1903) was a landowner and gardener based at Lamport Hall, Northampton. He is credited with beginning the tradition of garden gnomes in the United Kingdom when he introduced a number of terracotta figures from Germany in the 1840s.
Isham was educated at Rugby School and Brasenose College, Oxford. In 1846, on the death of his elder brother, he succeeded to the baronetcy.
In 1847, inspired by the writings of John Claudius Loudon, landscape gardener and horticulturalist, he commenced construction of a large rockery alongside his house. It was in this rockery that he first placed gnomes from Nuremberg as ornamentation. He is recorded as being the High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1851.
Isham died at The Bungalow, Horsham, Sussex at the age of 83.
Isham married Emily Vaughan, daughter of Sir John Vaughan and his wife Louisa Boughton on 26 October 1847. She died on 6 September 1898 aged 74. His first child, Vere Isham (later Sir Vere Isham 11th Bt. who married Millicent Vaughan in 1895) was born in 1862.
Isham Collection.
In 1867 several extremely rare books and manuscripts were rediscovered in the library and loft of his family home. These included a fragment of Thomas Edwards' "Cephalus and Procris; Narcissus" which had been lost for 200 years and was the only existing part until a full copy was subsequently discovered at the Cathedral Library at Peterborough.
Also discovered were first editions of Milton's "Paradise Lost" and "Paradise Regained" in their original sheepskin bindings. 
Further discoveries included:
for each of which only one or two other copies were known. The above four works found their way into the Britwell Court Library before being sold in February 1922 to A.S.W. Rosenbach for £3,600.

Yugo, Baltistan

Yugo (Yugu) is a small village with a population of about 6,000 people in the Ghanche district of Baltistan, an autonomous region that is considered part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region. The village is located above the Shyok River 75 km from Baltistan's capital Skardu on a tarmac highway heading towards Khaplu after passing Ghawari and Kunes. Yugo is situated adjacent to the geographically important village of Kharfak which boasts of a high-altitude mountain lake, Lake Kharfak. Khaplu which is Ghanche district's administrative capital lies a further 25 km away from Yugo."
Yugo is territorially separated from Kharfak by a strategically important landmark- the "Kharfak Bridge" which separates the territories of Yugo and Kharfak. Kharfak village lies on its immediate east, Ghawari on the west, Kharmang on the southern side and Balghar on the northeast. Yugo consists of the twin villages of "Yugo proper" and "Sirkiting (Baqir Colony)" which are separated by a glacier water stream near an area known as Gha Khari. A small bridge, the Sirkiting bridge, connects Sirkiting and Yugo proper. The people of Yugo refer to themselves as "Yugupa". The Shyok River meanders around the edges of the village, between the "bragh"- a towering huge bald rocky mountain and the village. A sandy area of the river bank on the north of the village across Shyok River which is locally referred to as "Foshfosh" is part of Yugo territory.
The famous Yugo chili pepper.
The village is traditionally renowned amongst its sister Balti villages for producing chili pepper- locally known as Snerma. The people of Yugo depended on selling chili pepper following the great floods- "Chusmen" of Shyok River in the early 1900s that destroyed most of their crops. Red chili pepper grown in Yugo is regionally famous for being very hot and spicy. Some Yugupas and their fellow Baltis believe that one of the reasons the Yugupas are considered sharper and more outspoken than the generally more mellow, docile and laid back Balti counterparts is due to the hot red pepper chillis. This is of course scientifically unproven but the people of Yugo seem to be more than happy to be associated with their spicy chili pepper- "The Yugo Snerma."
Scholarly fame.
The village is also famous for producing some of the region's most highly educated and respected scholars. The late Sheikh-ul-Hadith Mufti Azam Maulana Abdul Qadir Baltistani and Maulana Abdul Rahim Bin Muhammad Ali Yugovi were the famous Balti Sunni Ahl al-Hadith scholars who were recognised by many Baltis including those belonging to other sects during his life, for provision of a traditional Islamic justice system Shariat. The village is also known for a high number of scholars who to have studied Islamic religious education in the Islamic University of Madinah. Hundreds of students continue to study basic religious education in local madrassas or seminaries and then proceed to Ghawari for higher studies, some eventually ending up at Madinah University in Saudi Arabia. This is attributed to the fact that most of the village's inhabitants profess a form of Islam that is close to the Saudi version of Salafi Islam, known as Ahl al-Hadith in the South Asian region. However, the people of Yugo get along very well with their Sofia Imamia Noorbakshia and Shia neighbours and are thought to be very tolerant compared to most of their Arab counterparts. All baltis regardless of creed share a common cultural and linguistic heritage. Yugo village has also produced a number of highly trained and specialized professionals amongst the newer generation Yugupas who have settled abroad and in mainland Pakistan. Sadly, however, most of Yugos children still lack access to good schools and very few make it to universities.
Origins.
Due to ideological persecution. While details of their persecution are controversial, they are believed to be more secular with a
love for music especially drums-"Dang". The two "apo" were joined by another religious man Apo Baqir from Khaplu who
fled religious persecution and eventually settled in nearby Skirkiting. Eventually their descendants formed the twin villages of
Yugo and Skirkiting. The people of both Yugo proper and Skirkiting now generally regard themselves as Yugupa although some sections of smaller subsets within the community still prefer to maintain their original identities. For example, the people of Skirkiting sometimes refer to themselves as Baqirpa to differentiate themselves from the other Yugupas based on their being descendants of Apo Baqir. Generally, the people of Yugo proper display more caucasoid features being fairer, taller and with lighter and more broader eyes as compared to the people from Skirkiting who are more mongoloid in their features with slanted epicanthial folds and shorter, stouter stature and more darker complexion. This is attributed to their different origins- the people of Skirkiting being closer to their mongoloid kinsmen in Khaplu as opposed to the people of Yugo proper who are of Aryan origin like their counterparts in Gilgit. However, following numerous intermarriages, this may not always be true and it is now common to have mixed characteristics on both sides.
The people of Yugo.
The people of Yugo have maintained their unique identities and yet share cultural and religious beliefs. They profess a more tolerant version of Ahl al-Hadith sect of Sunni Islam. Several decades ago, Yugupas were all Sufia Nurbakhshi but following intense preaching by the late Sheikh-ul-Hadith Mufti Azam Maulana Abdul Qadir Baltistani and his contemporaries from Skirkiting like the late Apo Jaafar, they converted to Ahl al-Hadith form of Islam. Despite the love for music by most Baltis, it was banned after a religious revival movement by Sheikh-ul-Hadith Mufti Azam Maulana Abdul Qadir Baltistani in the late 1960s. Intermarriages between the two communities of Skirkiting and Yugo proper over time have led to more integration with the Yugupa now acquiring a relatively homogenous identity. 
Due to shortage of arable land and other resources, it is now estimated that more than half of its original inhabitants migrated to mainland Pakistan and overseas in search of better life including employment opportunities and both religious and secular education. Many Yugupa work in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, teachers, labourers and drivers with a few in the engineering, medical and marketing sectors. A number of Yugupa,most of them in mainland Pakistan and a handful abroad in North America, Australia and Africa are professionals in the medical and engineering sector.
Language.
Most of the current inhabitants speak Balti dialect similar to other areas of Baltistan, although the style of speaking is slightly different from other areas of Baltistan. Yugupa speak a dialect that is rougher, louder and with less emphasis on traditional intonation and, and less strain on the vowels at the end of speech than some of their counterparts for example in Khaplu.
Geography and biodiversity of Yugo.
Geographically, Yugo resembles much of the other himalayan regions including rest of Baltistan. The village settlements are at an average altitude of 10498 ft above sea level with the lowest point of the village- Fosh Fosh Thung which is a sandy river shore being 9186 ft above sea level close to the River Shyok. There are towering ice-capped mountains in the surrounding areas including Sn'gonpo Ran'ga - a high altitude plateau around 13,000 ft above sea level, as well as mountains Ming met la, Marpho khiyang ra la, Hyaqra, Khi sa and Dindaq khilas, which are all at heights greater than above sea level at their peaks. There are also cultivable (in summer) highland slopes like the "Ltep La" - which resembles the steppes, "Ghorawat", "Burat La" and "Thangwa". The area is in an earthquake-prone area close to Eurasian faultlines with minor earthquakes and tremors - "Sa gul" felt not so infrequently. The village also has a permanent spring which is the main source of clean drinking water provided to the houses via pipes. Electricity generated from hydroelectric power from the gushing glacier water streams from a neighbouring village is available in Yugo but supply is erratic and voltage fluctuations and outages are common. The mountain areas are known to have a number of endangered species like the snow leopard, brown bear, red fox also known as "Waa" and the beautiful Ibex which is a wild mountain goat locally known as Markhor. Exotic birds such as the Himalayan eagle, pheasants, chikor and partridges can also be spotted in the area. The rivers are rich in fresh-water fish like the "Saanya" and the Trout. Rare flowers and plants can also be spotted in summer and spring on the mountains. [http://www.visitnorthernareas.gov.pk/wild.htm]

643rd Tank Destroyer Battalion

The 643rd Tank Destroyer Battalion was a tank destroyer battalion of the United States Army active during the Second World War.
The battalion was activated at Camp Blanding on 15 December 1941, in line with the reorganisation of the anti-tank force, by redesignating the Provisional Antitank Battalion of the 43rd Infantry Division. It was later organized as a towed battalion, equipped with towed 3" anti-tank guns.
The 643rd deployed into Normandy exactly three years after it was activated, landing at Cherbourg on 15 December 1944. The following day, a major German offensive was launched in the Ardennes forest, beginning the Battle of the Bulge, and the battalion was rushed into action, arriving at the front on 22 December. One company was deployed that same evening to support an attack on Hotton by elements of Combat Command Reserve of the 3rd Armored Division. The battalion remained attached to the 3rd Armoured until 26 December, supporting it in a number of small-scale engagements.
The battalion was later briefly attached to the 82nd Airborne Division before being assigned to the 83rd Infantry Division on 2 February; it would serve with them for the remainder of the war After being re-equipped with M18 Hellcat tank destroyers in March, it pushed into central Germany with the 83rd, crossing the Elbe river before being withdrawn to take up occupation duties in the Harz Mountains at the end of the war.

Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible

"Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible" was a five-volume Biblical encyclopaedia published 1898—1904.
First edition.
The full title was "A Dictionary of the Bible, dealing with the Language, Literature and Contents, including the Biblical Theology". It was edited by James Hastings, with the assistance of John A. Selbie. Additional assistance with revision of the proofs was provided by A. B. Davidson, S. R. Driver and H. B. Swete. Four volumes (1898—1902) divided up the alphabetic entries, with a fifth volume (1904) devoted to some extra articles, indexes and maps. Publication was by T. & T. Clark in Edinburgh and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York.
Although described as a “dictionary”, the work is better described as an encyclopaedia, with signed articles sometimes several pages in length. It is a substantial work, with five quarto volumes each of about 900 pages. The 194 authors of articles were established scholars of the day, generally Protestant Christians, from many countries, but mostly from the UK and the USA in that order.
The subject matter was "the Old and New Testaments, together with the Old Testament Apocrypha, according to the Authorized and Revised English Versions." Articles were written "on names of all Persons and Places, on the Antiquities and Archaeology of the Bible, on its Ethnology, Geology and Natural History, on Biblical Theology and Ethic ..."
It remains a good source of Biblical information as understood around 1900.
1909 edition.
A one-volume dictionary with the same name was issued by the same publishers in 1909. It was described as "not a condensation of the five-volume set, but new and independent work". The editor was James Hastings, with the co-operation of John A. Selbie, and with the assistance of John C. Lambert and Shailer Mathews.
992 pages + xvi + 4 maps.
1963 edition.
A completely up-dated and revised one-volume edition was written by 148 scholars, edited by Frederick C. Grant and H. H. Rowley and issued by the same publishers in 1963. 1059 pages + maps.

"Tu m'oublieras" is a 1998 song recorded by French singer Larusso. It was the second single from her debut album, "Simplement", and was released in October 1998. It remains to date Larusso's best single, topping the chart in France and Belgium (Wallonia), and can be deemed as her signature song.
Song information.
The song was originally performed during the 1970s by Régine, Irma Jackson ("You Will Forget", 1979), then by Jeane Manson, under the title "Tu oublieras". Yves Dessca, who participated in the composition of the song, had previously written some songs for Michel Sardou and for the Eurovision Song Contest 1971. Unlike the original version, Larusso's cover contains many scats, modern gimmicks and some lyrics in English-language.
In France, the single featured in the top 100 for 42 weeks, from 28 November 1998. It debuted at #34, then climbed almost every week and finally reached number-one on January 31, 1999. It stayed there for 12 weeks, before dropping first slowly, then rather quickly, totalling 26 weeks in the top ten and 38 weeks in the top 50.
To date, it is the 43rd best-selling single of all time in France, and the 6th biggest hit in terms of chart positions.

Gries Glacier

The Gries Glacier () is a 5 km long glacier (2005) situated in the Lepontine Alps in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. In 1973 it had an area of 6.23 km2. In 2008 it had an area of 5.26 km2.
History.
Griesgletscher as well as the many surrounding Swiss Alpine glaciers have played an important role in the cultural and economic development of the Swiss Alps. During the Second World War owing to its proximity to the Swiss/Italian frontier the Swiss Army constructed a series of look-out posts and foxholes to reinforce this relatively undefined border area and as part of Switzerland hydro-electric building programme. A dam was built in front of the glacier, however the resulting dam contributed to the increased retreat of the glacier thanks to the glacier becoming decoupled from the bedrock as water levels in the dam increased.
Scientific research.
Over the years there has been a great deal of scientific research undertaken on Griesgletscher thanks to its accessibility and its unique ability to display a wide range of glaciological features within such a small manageable area. Some of the first studies of Griesgletcher were undertaken by M.J. Hambrey and were published in 1977 and 1980. The first was an investigation into the structures of ice cliffs at the snout of Griesgletscher. Griesgletscher was described as being relatively simple in shape, yet the structures being complex in detail. The 1980 study was on the dynamics and structure in which the velocity, rate of ice deformation with movement, and cumulative strains at various points on the glacier were investigated to determine how the glacier behaved as it moved. Other scientific research has been climate/glacier based in which the amount of glacier melting was correlated to local climatic variables such as sunlight, humidity, wind direction.
Other geological and scientific features.
However, Griesgletscher has been rapidly retreating over the last decade – a retreat that has been monitored through extensive geological and glaciological research.
The glacier, despite its size, is one of the most interesting and most widely studied in the Swiss Alps and during the last Ice Age was the source of a large tributary glacier that once fed into the main glacier that once flowed down the valley known today as Goms
The glacier has a very well developed supra glacial and sub glacial drainage system, which becomes very evident during the summer months and before the recent rapid glacial retreat the glacier terminated in the man-made dam, with high ice cliffs.
Surface features include glacial moraines as the glacier releases debris that has been eroded and then entrained by the glacier.
The profile of the glacier is a very convex terminus, which progresses into a very gentle concave mid profile with very crevassed ice field near to the upper accumulation zone - an area which is highly dangerous and difficult to traverse.

Martin Power

Martin Power is an English professional boxer who fights in the bantamweight division. He is a former British champion and has twice competed for the Commonwealth title.
Early Professional Career.
Power made his professional debut in June 2001 with a victory over Sean Grant at the York Hall in Bethnal Green. He compiled an unbeaten ledger of 16-0 with wins over the likes of Rocky Dean and Shinny Bayaar before getting a crack at the vacant British title in May 2005. He won the title with a win over Dale Robinson at the Elephant & Castle center in Southwark to become British Bantamweight champion.
British champion and Commonwealth challenger.
Following his victory over Robinson Power defended his title twice beating Ian Napa on a split decision over 12 rounds and Issac Ward who was stopped in the 8th round. Both contests took place at the York Hall. In June 2006 Power got the opportunity to add the Commonwealth title to his British when he met unknown South African Tshifhiwa Munyai once again in Bethnal Green. Munyai proved to be more than a handful and stopped Power in the 9th round to inflict the first professional defeat of his career on Power. A return match was organised in January 2007 but this match-up worked out even worse for Power as he was again defeated this time when his corner pulled him out in the 4th round.
Defeats to Napa and Davies.
In November 2007 Power challenged former foe Ian Napa for the British title that he had himself relinquished. Napa had beaten Jason Booth for the vacant version and Power was to be his first defence. Napa ended up winning the rematch in 12 rounds and Power crashed to his third consecutive defeat. On 18 December 2008, after being out of the ring for over a year, Power travelled to Dublin and lost for the fourth time in a row this time against Gary Davies, who would go on to become a British champion himself, via a 2nd round KO.
Changing stables.
Power chose to return to the amateur club in which he began his boxing career in a bid to return to winning ways. Power had initially joined the St Pancras amateur boxing club as an eight year old and went on to win a number of amateur titles for the club. Returning to the club as a professional also meant that Power would team up with St Pancras head coach CJ Hussein. On 2 June 2009 Power returned to action with Hussein in his corner and defeated Sid Razak at the York Hall. The return to winning ways did not last however when in his next outing on September 11, 2009 Power lost to Stuart Hall by stoppage in the 8th round of their 8 round contest. On 11 December 2009 Power met former British and Commonwealth title challenger Matthew Edmonds at the Newport Leisure Centre in Wales and scored a 5th round stoppage, topping off a mixed year since the return to St. Pancras.
British title challenge.
On 23 July 2010 Power returned to championship action as the challenger to former conqueror Stuart Hall who had gone on to lift the title with a win over Ian Napa earlier in the year. The fight, in Sunderland, saw Hall once again come out on top with the referee stopping the contest in the 10th round. For Hall it was only the 11th pro fight of his career and the 10th win with Power slipping to a sixth career defeat.

KUBX-LP

KUBX-LP was an independent television station in Salt Lake City, Utah, broadcasting locally on channel 58. Founded January 22, 1992, the station was owned by Equity Media Holdings.
Until January 4, 2009, KUBX was an affiliate of the Retro Television Network (RTN), operating as a translator for Four Points Media Group-owned KUSG from St. George. On that date, a contract conflict between Equity and Luken Communications, LLC (who had acquired RTN in June 2008) interrupted the programming on many RTN affiliates. As a result, Luken moved RTN operations to its headquarters in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and dropped all Equity-owned affiliates, including KUBX, immediately. RTN remained available in Utah on KUSG until later in 2009, when that station switched to This TV; it is now MyNetworkTV affiliate KMYU.
KUBX was sold at auction to the Daystar Television Network on April 16, 2009, indicating that another programming change was planned. However in the same auction, Daystar also acquired Equity sister station KUTF (Channel 12) in the market, eventually going on the air with Daystar in April 2010. Universal cable coverage of the national feed in the area also made it unlikely the station would come back to the air.
Effective January 1, 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) cancelled the station's license and deleted the KUBX-LP call sign from its database.

Obafemi Awolowo University massacre

The Obafemi Awolowo University massacre was a series of shootings and murders which took place against students of Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria on Saturday, July 10, 1999. It resulted in the deaths of eight people and injuring of 11, all of them students at OAU.
It was perpetrated by an organized death squad of 40 members of the Black Axe Confraternity branch at the university. They invaded the Awolowo Hall of the university at around 4:30 A.M., clad in black trousers and black T-shirts, their faces hidden by masks; they carried and made use of shotguns and hatchets against students.
The response.
At around 4 p.m., Lanre Adeleke, the president of the students' union, called an assembly of the students' union members in Oduduwa Hall; he then demanded for Vice-Chancellor Wole Omole's resignation due to Omole's past impeding of the union's anti-cult activities. A N10,000 reward was placed by the union for Omole's capture, resulting in a student takeover of the entire campus and the kidnapping and ransoming of Omole's wife, who was on her way to church on the following Sunday, July 11.
Students also erected roadblocks at the university entrances, impounded vehicles and launched vigilante searches to flush out the killers. After raiding a local police station to regain a suspect that they had turned over to the police after fears of police leniency surfaced, a suspect named Frank Idahosa Efosa admitted that he had overheard Omole being referred to as the "patron" of the Black Axes and also overheard that Omole had offered a large bounty for the deaths of the student union leaders.
By July 14, the Nigerian Universities Commission, headed by education minister Tunde Adeniran, recalled Omole from his position of Vice-Chancellor, and a multi-million naira investigation to uproot the confraternities was launched through the Nigerian university system; the Olusegun Obasanjo government, on the 15th, ordered police to patrol the university campuses.
The day before the funeral, Adeniran addressed a student union rally on the matter of the reinstatement of expelled students. Also, over N45,000 was raised by the student union, 30,000 of which went to the organization of the funeral.
Funeral.
Four of the "July 10th martyrs" were buried on July 20, 1999, at university cemetery. Around 20,000 people attended the funeral, including students from various institutions, workers, lecturers, parents, market women, and journalists from throughout Nigeria. A local woman donated the five coffins for the dead. The people that turned out thereafter proceeded in a long convoy of buses and cars to Iwo, the hometown town of George Akinyemi Iwilade (AFRIKA), late secretary general of the student union and founder of the Afrika Forward Movement (AFORM), a socio-political organization promoting African culture and values.Afrika was laid to rest on the family,s land in an emotional and befitting atmosphere. July 10 every year is marked by AFORM and the students of OAU in remembrance of these martyrs.
Two other injured victims later died in hospital, and their funerals were held separately.
In movies.
Since then,there have been many movies conveying a storyline as the incident. In 2005, a Nollywood movie titled 'Dugbe Dugbe',written and produced by the famous Yoruba movie star, Bukky Wright was produced. As usual,there was blur speculation about the relationship of the movie to the incident but these was later confirmed with the location(Obafemi Awolowo University),cast and storyline. In the movie, Africa (the prominent victim of the incident) was represented with Ladi who was killed on campus for his activism against cultism. Jibola, a known cultist who had been jailed upon conviction of committing such offenses in the past was granted clemency and fraudulently made the Students' Union Group president in order to facilitate latter investigations. The Vice-Chancellor alongside another lecturer was accused and convicted of being cultism kingpins,despite their ironic opposition to cultism. An automatic self-conviction of Prof. Omole aiding the incident was made at the movie's last scene.

Bucelas DOC

Bucelas (historically known as "Bucellas") is a Portuguese wine region located in the Lisboa wine region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a "Denominação de Origem Controlada" (DOC). Located south of the Arruda DOC, the region is noted for its potential for cool fermentation white wine production. Vineyards in the area are planted on predominately loam soils. The white wines of Bucelas were widely popular during the Elizabethan era in England and again during the Victorian age. In London the wines were sometimes described as "Portuguese hock" because of their similarities to the German Rieslings from the Rhine. Located north of the capital city of Lisbon, urban sprawl in the 20th century has caused viticulture in the area to be drastically reduced.
History.
Viticulture in Bucelas, located just north of Lisbon, has likely existed since Roman times. Historically a white wine, during the Elizabethan age it was popular among the English as a fortified wine with wine historians believing that the wine was likely the same "Charneco" wine mentioned by William Shakespeare in the play "Henry VI, Part 2" with Charneco being a local village in the Bucelas region. Eventually Bucelas was made as a non-fortified white wines, with British interests in the wine being revived during the Victorian age following the Peninsular War. During his time in Portugal, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington discovered the wine and imported large quantities back to his estate in the United Kingdom. With Wellington's favor, soon Bucelas was a fashionable wine on the London wine market where it was known as "Portuguese Hock".
During the 20th century, urban sprawl and development contributed to the decline of viticulture and winemaking in the region. By the early 1980s, all the vineyard lands in Bucelas was owned by a single wine estate with a poor reputation for quality. Towards the turn of the century, following a wave of enthusiasm and revival for Portuguese's indigenous grape varieties, new winemakers started to set up operation in the area to produce wines from the local grapes.
Grapes and winemaking.
The principal grapes of the Bucelas region includes Arinto and Esgana Cao. In the Victorian age, Bucelas' association as "Portuguese Hock" lead many in the wine industry to assume that its primary grape, Arinto, was somehow related to German wine grape Riesling. Ampelographers in the late 20th century were eventually able to disprove any relation between the two grapes. A characteristic of Arinto and its blending partner Esgana Cao, a name loosely translated to mean dog strangler, is their ability to retain high levels of acidity even in the warm sub-Mediterranean climate near Portugal's coast.
In recent years, Bucelas winemakers have been experimenting with different winemaking techniques including production of late harvest and sparkling wines made according to the traditional method.

Aviem Sella

Aviem Sella (, born January 7, 1946) is a former colonel in the Israeli Air Force.
Aviem Sella (originally Slibiosiky), was born in Haifa during the Mandate era. He studied at the Hebrew Reali School, and began his national service in the Israel Defense Forces in 1963, joining the Israeli Air Force as a fighter pilot. In 1967, he fought in the Six-Day War with 109 Squadron. He was one of the first Israeli pilots to fly F-4 Phantom jets, and was also one of the founders of 69 Squadron. He fought in the War of Attrition of 1967-1970, participating in Operation Priha (January-April 1970) and Operation Rimon 20 (July 1970). The outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 found Sella in the United States studying at a professional course; he returned to Israel and fought in the war as deputy commander of 69 Squadron. Between 1976 and 1979, he commanded a fighter squadron, and between 1980 and 1983, he served as the Air Force's Director of Operations. He commanded Operation Opera, the air strike against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981, and was a commanding officer in Operation Mole Cricket 19 during the 1982 Lebanon War.
In the 1980s, Sella took a sabbatical to the United States to study, and earned an MA in computer science at New York University's Faculty of Computer Applications and Information Systems. While pursuing a PhD, Sella recruited Jonathan Pollard to spy for Israel. The US indicted Pollard on espionage charges in 1987.
Pollard's Israeli handlers were granted immunity from prosecution in the United States in exchange for cooperation after Pollard's arrest. Sella's role, however, was unknown at the time and the Israelis were not forthcoming about his involvement. For this reason, Sella was not given immunity by the US when his role was uncovered. Israel then refused to extradite Sella for questioning. In March 1987 a Federal grand jury indicted Sella "in absentia" on three counts of espionage, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a $500,000 fine.
After Sella was promoted to Brigadier General and given command of Tel Nof Airbase, the U.S. Congress reacted by threatening to cut aid to Israel. U.S. officials in Israel were instructed to have no contact with Sella or with the airbase so long as he commanded it. Israel refused to relieve him of his duties, creating tensions. Sella then resigned to defuse US-Israel tensions, and was subsequently appointed an instructor at Israel's National Security College.
Sella completed his PhD at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Management and earned a degree in economics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1990 he founded "Sibm", an IT company, which acted as a consultant on information systems. In September 2003, he sold his company - which had 40 employees - to Matrix ID Ltd and became director of strategic consulting at Matrix's Security Division. From 2005 to 2006, he served as chairman of the Adam Milo Institute in Jerusalem. He also became a business partner of Alexander Beer, a brewery based in the Emek Hefer Industrial Park.

Other Recorded Historical Figures
History and background.
Over 300 years ago the Church of England held services in Oyster Bay, led by missionaries from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. This congregation founded Christ Church in 1705, making it one of the oldest parishes on Long Island.
Services were first held in the "Town-House" in 1702. The town common was the present church property, and the town hall was located about where Christ Church stands today. A second town hall, authorized in 1707, was designed with seating for church purposes, and in 1750 a true church building was erected. Thus the town hall had morphed into a church, and in due time the town gave the common and the building to the congregation.
Then came the American Revolution. After many decades of growth and forward movement, the Church of England in America was stopped in her tracks. Disestablishment to the Anglican Church meant an end to any tax support. The church in Oyster Bay was damaged by Hessians who used the building as barracks, and was such a deteriorated state that it had to be demolished in 1801. The rector of Oyster Bay, Leonard Cutting, was a Tory and eventually forced to leave the area by patriots.
Thereafter, Oyster Bay was only served by occasional visiting clergy until the 1830s. In short, it took about fifty years for the Anglican congregation in Oyster Bay to recover from the Revolution.
In 1802 the Oyster Bay Academy was established, in the two-story building seen at the end of the drive. Students attended class here until a public school was built in the 1840s on South Street. At that time the old Academy building became the Christ Church rectory.
The congregation had been dormant for over 40 years when they reorganized in 1843. By 1844 they had built their third church building on this site. This was removed to make way for a new building in 1878, portions of which remain visible today. These include the wood trusses in the nave and a small section of pews used by the Theodore Roosevelt family who worshiped here. Following the death of Theodore Roosevelt, a simple funeral service was held here before he was laid to rest in nearby Youngs Memorial Cemetery.
A renovation in 1925 encased the wooden 1878 building in stone. Those additions also included striking stained-glass windows, modeled after the Chartres Cathedral in France. One of the finest pipe organs on Long Island was installed in 1986, a beautiful Hellmuth Wolff organ, to complement Christ Church’s extensive music program.
Plaques in memory of many members of the Roosevelt family are mounted on the wall near the old pews, and all around the church are other memorials, dedicated to Christ Church members, many of whose names are familiar as place names in the community, such as Underhill, Fleet, Townsend, Beekman, Weeks and Youngs, to name only a few.
The congregation remained active over the ensuing years. A renovation of the 1802 rectory and addition of a pipe organ to the sanctuary were completed in the 1980s. In the 1990s a renovation of the church interior occurred. A campaign to renovate the Parish Hall came to a completion in 2008 when improvements were made to both the hall, and the area surrounding it.

Fadrique Enríquez

Fadrique Enríquez (ca. 1465–1538), 4th Lord of Medina de Rioseco, was the 4th Admiral of Castile and played an important role in defeating the Revolt of the Comuneros.
Fadrique Enríquez was the son of Alonso Enríquez (1435-1485) and María de Velasco. He inherited his father's possessions in Palencia and the castle of Medina de Rioseco. On February 14, 1490, he was appointed Admiral of Castile by the Reyes Católicos. He was a cousin of King Ferdinand II of Aragon, son of John II of Aragon and Juana Enríquez of Córdoba.
Fadrique Enríquez was hot-tempered and was banished to Sicily after a row with Queen Isabella I of Castile. In 1489 he was rehabilitated and participated in the conquest of Baza and the Battle of Granada.
During his stay in Sicily, he married the very rich Ana de Cabrera, countess of Modica, Osona, Cabrera and Bas. They had no children.
Fadrique Enríquez himself was count of Melgar, lord of Medina de Rioseco, Mansilla, Rueda, Aguilar, and Villabrajima and was one of the richest persons in Spain. His yearly income was estimated at 50.000 ducats.
In 1496 he accompanied Joanna of Castile to Flanders to be married to Philip the Handsome. On his return, he escorted Philip's sister, Margaret, to Spain to be married to prince John.
Fadrique reached the highest political power during the Revolt of the Comuneros.

Carcavelos DOC

Carcavelos is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Carcavelos municipality in Estremadura region and includes land near the cities of Cascais and Oeiras. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a "Denominação de Origem Controlada" (DOC). Located at the very southern tip of the Estremadura region, the region has a long winemaking history dating back to the 18th century when Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal owned vineyards here. The region is known for its fortified wine production, creating off dry, topaz colored wines that have nutty aromas and flavors. While once a thriving wine region, world renown in the 19th century for its tawny colored fortified wine, in the modern era Carcavelos has been devastated by real estate development in the suburbs of the capital city of Lisbon and nearby coastal city of Estoril.
History.
While viticulture has likely existed in this region since Roman times, it was not until the Marquis of Pombal established the region as a winemaking center in the 18th century that Carcavelos came to be associated with wine. Pombal's actions were perhaps self-serving since he owned extensive vineyard on his estate in Oeiras. Prior to this, Pombal would sell his grapes to Port wine producers in the Douro, in violation of his own 1756 regulations establishing the "Companhia Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro" (General Company of Viticulture of the Upper Douro or C.G.A.V.A.D.) which aimed to guarantee the authenticity of Port by mandating that it be made completely from Douro grapes.
Pombal's estate eventually built a reputation for Carcavelos of fortified wine production. In the early 19th century, the wines were very popular with the British market in London, particularly at the auction houses. In 1908, the region was officially demarcated as "Região Demarcada" (an early precursor to the "Denominação de Origem Controlada" appellation system). However the 20th century has seen a rapid decline in viticulture in the region because of the urban sprawl expansion of the capital city of Lisbon and the nearby city of Estoril. By the turn of the 21st century only 25 acres (10 hectares) of vines remain, consisting mostly of what is left of Pombal's estate and two independent vineyards. In a fate similar to the other principal regions of the Lisboa VR-the Colares DOC and Bucelas DOC-there has been some spark of interest on the part of small independent winemakers to revive the historic legacy and indigenous grapes of the region so Carcavelos' fortunes may change in the future.
Climate and geography.
Typical of the Estremadura, Carcavelos has a Mediterranean climate that is moderated by its close proximity to the mouth of the Tagus river.
Grapes and winemaking.
Carcavelos can be a blend of up to nine different grapes. The principal grapes of the Carcavelos region includes Arinto, Boal, Galego Dourado, Negra Mole, Trincadeira and Torneiro . The wines are usually fermented completely dry with some fermenting must known as the "vinho abafado" containing some residual sugar set aside prior to the fermentation's completion. The wine is fortified with a distilled grape spirit to bring the wine up to an alcohol level of 18-20% and the "vinho abafado" is added back in to add sweetness to the wine. Carcavelos wines are then aged in oak barrels for three to five years to give the wines a tawny color and nutty flavor.

Artus de Lionne

Artus de Lionne (1655–1713), abbé and Bishop of Rosalie "in partibus infidelium", in Turkey, was a French missionary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. He was a son of Louis XIV's Foreign Minister, Hugues de Lionne.
Artus de Lionne was born in Rome in 1655. He first left for Siam as a missionary, in 1681.
He returned to France in 1686, serving as translator to the embassy of the Siamese Kosa Pan to the court of Louis XIV. Artus de Lionne then returned to Siam with the Siamese embassy in 1687 on board the ships of the French ambassador Simon de la Loubère. He played a role in the negotiation between the French and Siamese sides during the 1688 Siamese Revolution, which resulted in the expulsion of the French forces. Artus de Lionne left Siam with General Desfarges following the French defeat in the Siege of Bangkok, leaving Mgr Louis Laneau a prisoner of the Siamese for several years.
Artus de Lionne then went to China as a missionary in 1689, where he worked with Bishop Maigrot in Fukien province. He was for a time the archbishop of Sichuan.
Artus de Lionne returned to Europe on February 17, 1702, accompanying the Chinese Christian Arcadio Huang. Artus de Lionne and Arcadio Huang embarked on a ship of the English East India Company in order to reach London. By September or October 1702, they left England for France, in order to travel to Rome. On the verge of being ordained a priest in Rome and being presented to the pope to demonstrate the reality of Chinese Christianity, Arcadio Huang apparently renounced and declined ordination. Artus de Lionne preferred to return to Paris to further his education, and wait for a better answer.
In 1705-1707, Artus de Lionne accompanied the mission of Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon to the Chinese Emperor Kang Hsi. The mission affirmed the prohibition of Chinese rites in 1707, but was as a result banished to Macao. 
Artus de Lionne significantly influenced the editing of the 1707 treatise against Chinese philosophy of Nicolas Malebranche, ("Entretien d'un philosophe Chrétien et d'un philosophe chinois sur l'existence et la nature de Dieu"). He died in Paris in 1713.

Toddler's fracture

Toddler's fractures or childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures are bone fractures of the distal (lower) part of the shin bone (tibia) in toddlers (aged 9 months-3 years) and other young children (less than 8 years). The fracture involves the distal third to distal half of the tibia, is undisplaced and has a spiral pattern. It occurs after low-energy trauma, sometimes with a rotational component.
Diagnosis.
Typical symptoms include pain, refusing to walk or bear weight and limping -bruising and deformity are absent. On clinical examination, there can be warmth and swelling over the fracture area, as well as pain on bending the foot upwards (dorsiflexion). The initial radiographical images may be inconspicuous (a faint oblique line) and often even completely normal. After 1-2 weeks however, callus formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for osteomyelitis, transient synovitis or even child abuse. Contrary to CAST fractures, non-accidental injury typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.
Other possible fractures in this area, occurring in the cuboid, calcaneus, and fibula, can be associated or can be mistaken for a toddler's fracture. In some cases, an internal oblique radiography and radionuclide imaging can add information to anterior-posterior and lateral views. However, since treatment can also be initiated in the absence of abnormalities, this appears to have little value in most cases. It could be useful in special cases such as children with fever, those without a clear trauma or those in which the diagnosis remains unclear. Recently, ultrasound has been suggested as a helpful diagnostic tool.
Pathophysiology.
The proposed mechanism involves shear stress and lack of displacement due to the periosteum that is relatively strong compared to the elastic bone in young children.
Treatment.
Treatment consist of a long leg orthopedic cast for several weeks.
History.
The condition was initially recognised by Dunbar and co-workers in 1964. A new terminology has been proposed, which defines toddler's fracture as a subset of childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures.

Swanton Novers is a village and a civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. The village is west-south-west of Cromer, north-north-west of Norwich and north-north-east of London. The village lies south-west of the town of Holt. The nearest railway station is at Sheringham for the Bittern Line which runs between Sheringham, Cromer and Norwich. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport.
History.
Swanton Novers has an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086, in which the village is recorded by the name "Suanetuna". The main tenant was Bishop William. The survey also notes that there were 200 sheep. The name "Suanetuna" means 'town or settlement of the swine-herds'. The land was held by Milo de Nuiers in 1200. This name derives from Noyers-Bocage in Normandy.
St Edmund's Church.
St Edmund's parish church is a little remote from the village. The church has been heavily restored in recent times as it was in a very poor state of repair. The church's tower was rebuilt in 1821.

The newspaper is distributed in Niue, New Zealand and Australia, and has a circulation of 800. It is a bilingual newspaper, published both in English and in Niuean.
The "Niue Star" was founded with the assistance of UNESCO, which provided Jackson with equipment including a computer, a digital camera and a printing press. It also provided Jackson with a journalism course. The latter had previously worked as publisher of the now-defunct government newspaper "Tohi Tala Niue", but set up the private "Niue Star" as his own initiative.
The "Star" was originally printed in Alofi, until its main office and printing shop were destroyed by Cyclone Heta in 2004. It then moved to Auckland, and is still printed there today. 
According to its editor, Michael Jackson,
However, Jackson also reports on political news ("the government is, you know, not doing the right thing and the people want to know, then I will insist in reporting it."), and, through the "Star", aims to "connect Niueans wherever they are". A large majority of Niueans live outside Niue itself, which, due to continuous emigration, has a population of barely 1000. Most Niuean expatriates live in New Zealand, where the "Niue Star" is distributed within the Niuean community.
In addition to its single newspaper, Niue has audiovisual news media, namely Television Niue and Radio Sunshine.

Amphitryon (play)

Amphitryon is a Latin play for the early Roman theatre by playwright Titus Maccius Plautus. It is Plautus’ only play on a mythological subject; he refers to it as a "tragicomoedia" (tragic comedy) in the prologue. It includes Amphitryon’s jealous and confused reaction to Alcmena’s seduction by Jupiter, and ends with the birth of Hercules.
Plot.
"Amphitryon" begins with a prologue given by the god Mercury, in which he gives some background information to the audience. Amphitryon and his slave Sosia have been away at war and are returning to Thebes. Meanwhile, the god Jupiter is sleeping with Amphitryon’s wife Alcmena. Jupiter is in the guise of Amphitryon so that Alcmena is unaware that he is not her husband.
Mercury's job is to buy his father Jupiter some time by deceiving those who would interfere. He changes his appearance to look like the slave Sosia, and when the real Sosia arrives, he beats him up and sends him away from the house. Thoroughly confused by having been beat up by himself, Sosia returns to the ship to relay what happened to his master Amphitryon.
The following morning, Amphitryon sets off for the house, annoyed by his slave's foolish sounding story. Jupiter leaves only moments before Amphitryon arrives, and when Alcmena sees her real husband, she is confused as to why he has returned. Amphitryon doesn't appreciate this strange welcome after being gone for so many months, and confusion turns to anger and jealousy after learning that she has slept with a man who is not himself.
After a long argument, Alcmena is ready to leave her untrusting husband but is stopped by Jupiter. He soon begins to set things right, and in a miraculous event, Alcmena gives birth to twin boys. One is the son of Amphitryon, the other is Hercules, the son of Jupiter. To quell Amphitryon’s anger, he explains to him what he did, and Amphyitryon is then honored to have shared his wife with a god.

Hlawga National Park

Hlawaga National Park () is a national park located in Mingaladon, Yangon Division, Myanmar, 22 miles (35 km) north of Yangon. The 1540-acre (623-hectare) park includes an 818-acre (313 hectare) wildlife park, a 62-acre (25-hectare) mini-zoo and a 660-acre (267-hectare) buffer zone.
First established as an environmental education center in 1982, the national park is a popular day-trip destination with Yangonites and ecotourists.
History.
The park embraces the catchment area of the Zokanabe Lake, an extension dam built in 1921–24 to reinforce the greater Hlawga Lake which has supplied water to Yangon since 1904. The park was established in 1982 with joint-funding by the UNDP and the Burmese government in order to protect the forests and vegetative cover in the catchment of Hlawga Lake, and to establish a representative collection of Burmese indigenous wildlife species of mammals, reptiles and birds, in their natural habitats.
Attractions.
Wildlife.
The wildlife park is home to various types of deer (eld's deer, hog deer, barking deer, sambar deer), as well as rhesus monkey, pythons, and pangolin. Their natural habitats consists of semi-evergreen forests, mixed deciduous forests, and swamp forests. According to a 1992 survey, the park was home to at least 21 species of mammals, 145 species of birds and 8 species of reptiles.
Barking deer, hog deer and wild boar are the most common mammal species. Slow lores, pangolin and a few species of jungle cats used to roam the park at night feeding on figs, which is abundantly found in the park. 
The semi-evergreen type of vegetation creates ideal habitats for a variety of reptiles from monitor lizards to cobra, and krait ( Bungarus fasciatus) to pythons (Python reticulatus).
Birds.
Resident and migratory birds are abundant inside the park. Identified species include: the Jungle Fowl (Gallus gallus), Red-vented Bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer), Lesser Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna javanica), Asian Openbill Stork (Anastomus oscitans), Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticonax nycticorax) and White-throated Babbler (Turdoides gularis).
Flora.
The evergreen forest contains at least 295 species of plants. Common species are Dipterocarps and langerstroemia speciosa. Also found are deciduous species such as teak (Tectona grandis) and binga (Mitragyna rotundifolia), and medicinal plants such as sindonma-nwe (Tinospora cordifolia).
Mini-Zoo.
The mini-zoo has small mammals, birds, tigers, leopards, bears and estuarine crocodiles in large spacious cages, avaries and moated enclosures.
Activities.
Visitors can go on a safari-style bus ride or an elephant ride through the park, hiking on jungle trails, boating on the lake, and/or bird watching. However, most local visitors use the park's picnic areas.
The park is divided into three zones: a rest and retreat zone, an adventure and recreation zone, and an education and hobby zone. The rest and retreat zone features forest eco-lodges, boat houses and a health spa resort. The adventure and recreation zone has facilities for jungle trekking, bird watching and wild life safaris, as well as a camping ground and training areas for mountain climbing and parachuting. The education and hobby zone includes a timber species display center, a butterfly park, an insect kingdom, a reptile park and fishing spots.
Climate.
Located in coastal Yangon Division, the park has a monsoonal climate. Annual average rainfall is about 95 inches (240 cm) most of which is received between late May and October. The coolest months are from November to February (average high: 32C and average low: 18C) and the hottest months are from March to May (average high: 37C and average min: 24C). The mean relative humidity is 87%.

Migs Mijares (Dingdong Dantes) was so in love with Joy (Marian Rivera) that in less than a year, he asked for her hand in marriage.
Even when Bela (Iza Calzado), the childhood sweetheart of Migs, returned from Canada and made an attempt to win him back, Migs's decision to marry his present girlfriend was resolute.
But early on, a tragedy struck the blissful marriage of Migs and Joy.
Migs had an accident, which caused his isolated retrograde amnesia. His last memory was that of his first and ex-girlfriend, and he forgot everything about his wife.
Joy did her best to bring things back to normal, but her husband could not feel any emotional connection with her. Migs could not take his mind off his first love. Meanwhile, Bela tried so hard to distance herself from her Migs, but the latter was persistent.
For her part, Joy became too interfering, always checking the whereabouts of her husband and monitoring his calls. This provoked Migs to make a choice: Be with his first love.
Joy made a last-ditch effort to save the marriage by talking to Bela but the meeting was futile.
At first, Migs and Bela were happy. But after a while, Migs started missing his wife. He became confused again, and slowly, he realized the girl who is his one true love.

The final gross of the movie is P62,422,592 according to box office mojo.

Kuopio Province

The Kuopio Province (, ) was a province of Finland from 1831 to 1997. The province was named after the city of Kuopio.
History.
The predecessor of province was the County of Savolax and Karelia, which was established in 1775 when Finland was integrated part of Sweden.
As a consequence of the tumultuous conflicts of the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden had allied itself with the Russian Empire, United Kingdom and the other parties of the Fourth Coalition against Napoleonic France. However, following the treaty of Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, Russia made peace with France and left the coalition. This enabled Russia in 1808 to challenge Sweden in the Finnish War, over the control of Finland. In the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on September 17, 1809 Sweden was obliged to cede all its territory in Finland, east of the Torne River, to Russia.
The ceded territories became a part of the Russian Empire and were reconstituted into the Grand Duchy of Finland, with the Russian Tsar as the Grand Duke. At first there wasn't any changes in the County of Savolax and Karelia, which was now a province in the autonomic Grand Duchy. Kuopio Province was established in 1831 from this province, while its southern parts were transferred to the new Mikkeli Province.
In 1960 the eastern part of the Kuopio province was separated as the Northern Karelia Province. In 1997 the province was reunited with Northern Karelia and together they merged with the Mikkeli Province, to establish the new Eastern Finland Province.

Yugoslav destroyer Split

The Yugoslav destroyer "Split" was a destroyer built for the Yugoslav Navy in 1938. She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders and was named after the city of the same name. She was acquired in 1950 and was commissioned in July 1958 and was decommissioned in 1980.
Design.
The Yugoslav Navy decided to order a new large destroyer in the late 1930s to follow the Dubrovnik with an updated version significantly larger than her predecessor. The French company Chantiers de Loire helped with design work basing the ship on the Le Fantasque class destroyer. The machinery was supplied by Yarrow Shipbuilders and the guns by Skoda (Czechoslovakia) and Bofors (Sweden). 
The designed armament was
The ship was laid down in 1939 with material supplied from France and Britain. By the time war with Italy broke out in 1940, 600 tons of material had been delivered. The guns from Skoda and Bofors were embargoed due to the war.
Service.
World War II.
When the city of Split was captured by the Axis, the hull remained undamaged and "Regia Marina" decided to complete the ship. New machinery was ordered from Tosi, and 135mm, 37mm, and 20mm guns replaced the Czech and Swedish weapons. The incomplete ship was launched in July 1943 but Italy's Armistice with the Allies led to her being scuttled in Split harbour. The Germans salvaged the wreck but did not seriously consider completing her. When Yugoslav Partisans and Royal Marines liberated the city of Split the hull was found half sunken next to the yard's fitting out dock.
Postwar completion.
The war damage to the Split yard led the Yugoslavs to tow the hull to Rijeka for completion by the 3 Maj yard. The Yugoslavs received assistance from Great Britain, which supplied new boilers and turbines, and the USA which supplied guns and fire control equipment. The ship was finally commissioned in late 1958.
"Split" served as flagship of the Yugoslav Navy until the mid-1970s when a boiler explosion led to her being relegated to a stationary training ship. She was decommissioned in 1980, officially deleted on 2 February 1984 and scrapped in 1986.

<doc id="19512487" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19512487" title="Lobbying in the United Kingdom">
Lobbying in the United Kingdom

Lobbying in the United Kingdom plays a significant role in the formation of legislation and a wide variety of commercial organisations, lobby groups 'lobby' for particular policies and decisions by Parliament and other political organs at national, regional and local levels.
The phrase "lobbying" comes from the gathering of Members of Parliament and peers in the hallways (or lobbies) of Houses of Parliament before and after parliamentary debates. One definition of lobbying says it means:
Formal procedures enable individual members of the public to lobby their Member of Parliament but most lobbying activity centres on corporate, charity and trade association lobbying, where organisations seek to amend government policy through advocacy. Companies and individuals who operate in this sector commonly use the terms 'Public relations', 'public affairs', 'political consultancy' or 'corporate affairs' to describe their activities (though this was also a reaction to the negative publicity surrounding the word 'lobbyists' following the 1994 Cash-for-questions affair). Professional public affairs agencies, representing multiple clients, undertake a significant proportion of lobbying activity in addition to individual organisations conducting lobbying on an in-house basis.
Summary.
The professional lobbying industry has been rapidly growing since the mid-1990s and in 2007 was estimated to be worth £1.9 billion, employing 14,000 people. The report also suggested that some MPs are approached over 100 times a week by lobbyists.
Since 1994 there have been various complaints by MPs about unacceptable lobbying and several police investigations. Current levels of lobbying are causing concern as is the 'revolving door' which allow individuals to move rapidly between legislative and commercial roles in the same sectors creating potential conflict of interests. Ministers are making increasing use of Special Advisors (staff members employed by the minister personally, but paid for from the public purse) who are often selected from the related private sector industries and have been sometimes been criticised for engaging in campaigning while still on the government payroll or for moving directly between lobbying roles and the advisor role.
There is presently no formal or mandatory registration process for lobbyists and consequently there are many self-employed or freelance workers who consider themselves to be lobbyists of some sort. In 2009 the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee recommended creation of a statutory register of lobbying companies and activities (similar to the one required in the United States), but the government rejected that recommendation. The United Kingdom lobbying sector is currently self-regulated by the Public Affairs Council, which registers individual lobbyists.
History.
1800s to 1994.
During the 1800s petitions were a popular way of raising issues with parliament and in 1839, 13,657 public petitions were presented on more than 90 different subjects with a total of over 4.5 million signatures.
In 1866 a group of 'Suffragists' petitioned and lobbied parliament that women should have the same political rights as men. They were unsuccessful and in 1903 the Suffragettes were formed whose motto was 'Deeds not Words'; they heckled ministers, displayed banners and used both violent and non-violent direct action; equal voting rights for women was achieved with the Representation of the People Act 1928.
In 1923, Winston Churchill acted as a highly paid lobbyist for Burmah Oil (now BP plc) to persuade the British government to allow Burmah to have exclusive rights to Persian (Iraqi) oil resources, which were successfully granted.
1994 to 2000.
In 1994 The Guardian claimed parliamentary lobbyist Ian Greer of Ian Greer Associates, had bribed two Conservative Members of Parliament in exchange for asking parliamentary questions, and other tasks, on behalf of Mohamed Al-Fayed in what became known as the Cash-for-questions affair. Following a lengthy libel case brought by Neil Hamilton and Grier and a parliamentary investigation it was found that "Mr Hamilton's conduct fell seriously and persistently below the standards which the House is entitled to expect of its Members." It was also found that Michael Brown MP had failed to register an introduction payment in relation to US Tobacco (Skoal tobacco)" and had "persistently and deliberately failed to declare his interests in dealing with Ministers and officials over the Skoal Bandits issue." Others were also criticised.
Shortly before the 1997 general election Bernie Ecclestone the head of Formula One donated £1 million to the Labour party; after Labour's victory and after a meeting between Tony Blair and Mr Ecclestone the Department of Health sought exemption for Formula One from the EU’s proposed ban on tobacco advertising. This event was cited as one of the reasons for the 2008 inquiry. 
Jonathan Aitken, previously Minister of State for Defence Procurement under John Major in 1992 was jailed in 1999 in relation to the Arms-to-Iraq scandal. Prior to becoming minister he had been a director of an arms company BMARC, and after losing his seat at the 1997 election he was appointed as a representative for the arms company GEC-Marconi.
2000 to 2010.
In 2006 it was alleged that by making donations or loans to political parties is was possible to 'buy' life peerages and thereby participate in the creating legislation directly (Cash for Honours). After a 16-month investigation the police said that no prosecution would be brought because "while peerages may have been given in exchange for loans, it could not find direct evidence that that had been agreed in advance; this direct evidence of an agreement in advance is what would be required for a successful prosecution". This claim was cited as one reason for the reasons for the 'Lobbying: Access and Influence in Whitehall' report (see below).
In March 2007 the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges published a report following a complaint about the conduct of David Cameron regarding his 'Leader's Group'. The complaint related back to August 2007 when David Cameron's Chief Fundraiser used a researcher pass allotted to a Conservative peer Lord Harris of Peckham to gain access to facilities inside the Palace of Westminster and investigated a series of fundraising events which allowed donors to meet Cameron. The investigation concluded that it was improper to employ parliamentary staff for fund-raising purposes and that it was "ill-advised to link directly, in promoting the Leader's Group, the issues of access to his office and party fund-raising". Lord McNally, a member of the Lords Committee said that this was "yet another example of how pressure on political parties to raise ever larger sums from private sources pollutes our politics". Using passes in this way does not however break any written rule.
A freedom of information request in July 2007 showed that BAA executives met the Department for Transport 117 times between 2002 and 2007, including 24 meetings with the Secretary of State.
In October 2007 Lord Hoyle (a member of the House of Lords) was paid an undisclosed sum to introduce an arms lobbyist, a former RAF officer who worked for BAE, to the Defence Minister, Lord Drayson. The lobbyist had also a security pass as a 'research assistant' from another MP. Accepting money for introductions is 'frowned on' but not illegal.
In 2008, supporters of the anti-aviation lobby group Plane Stupid managed to get onto the roof of the Palace of Westminster and dropped a banner reading 'BAA HQ' as a reference to the close relationship BAA Limited had with government. Stunts such as this had become a relatively common lobbying tactic, having been used by Fathers for Justice previously. Prime Minister Gordon Brown referred to the stunt saying: "The message should go out today very clearly that decisions in this country should be made in the chamber of this House and not on the roof of this House". In January 2009 Labour MP John Grogan claimed there was an "intricate web" linking BAA, British Airways and Whitehall which had a direct influence on government policy resulting in the approval of a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Liberal Democrat MP, Susan Kramer MP said that Commons investigation was "a matter of public interest and is imperative."
In January 2009 "The Sunday Times" claimed that when a reporter had posed as a lobbyist that Lord Snape, Lord Moonie, Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Lord Truscott had offered to influence legislation in return for payment (main:Cash for influence). The Metropolitan Police said that no action would be taken, noting that "The application of the criminal law to members of the House of Lords in the circumstances that have arisen here is far from clear," and "there are very clear difficulties in gathering and adducing evidence in these circumstances in the context of parliamentary privilege." The House of Lords voted to suspend Lord Taylor and Lord Truscott for six months in the first such action since the 17th century.
In February 2010 there were several separate developments:
In March 2010 Dispatches and The Sunday Times recorded four Members of Parliament offering lobbying in return for influence with the Cabinet. Stephen Byers, a former member of the cabinet was recorded as saying he would work for up to £5,000 a day and was like a "cab for hire.
In March 2010 the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments revealed that Tony Blair, who resigned as prime minister and as an MP on 27 June 2007 had acted as a paid business consultant to an oil firm with interests in Iraq just 14 months after leaving office. In July 2008 he had requested to the committee that his relationship with UI Energy Corporation should be kept secret for reasons of 'market sensitivity' and the committee agreed to postpone publication for three months against normal procedures; the committee then had to then "chase" Blair and send a formal letter to his office in November 2009 which was responded to in February 2010 with a request for continued secrecy. The committee chairman Lord Lang disagreed and the information was published on their website with the note 'Publication delayed due to market sensitivities'. UI Energy also retains other senior political figures including former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke, former US Secretary of Defense United States Mr. Frank Carlucci and a former US commander for the Middle East, General John Abizaid. The news raised concerns that he had profited financially from contacts he made during the Iraq war. Blair also earned money from the ruling family in Kuwait from December 2007 for whom he produced as report on the oil state's future over the next 30 years for a reported £1m fee. An investigation by The Guardian in 2009 found that he had put his multimillion-pound income through "an obscure partnership structure called Windrush Ventures, which enabled him to avoid publishing normal company accounts".
2011.
In December 2011 the Independent newspaper reported that lobbying agency Bell Pottinger claimed to have been responsible for a variety of activities on behalf of clients that were considered not in the public interest including the manipulation of Google searches and Wikipedia pages. One allegation was that Bell Pottinger, acting on behalf of Dyson, used its influence with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Office to get the Prime Minister to raise concerns about counterfeit goods with the Chinese Prime Minister.
2013.
"Two years ago anyone who had set foot in Conservative HQ could get a highly paid job, there was panic-hiring of Tories", said one lobbyist; however, with the Con-Lib coalition struggling and Labour ahead in opinion polls by about 10%, lobbying firms naturally wanted boost their links with Labour: "About half the agencies I work with have specific requirements for people with Labour contacts."
Proposed regulation of lobbying.
In January 2009 the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee published a report 'Lobbying: Access and Influence in Whitehall' which noted:
The report recommended "A statutory register of lobbying activity to bring greater transparency to the dealings between Whitehall decision makers and outside interests." It also concluded that the self-regulation of the professional lobbying industry was "fragmented" and appeared to "involve very little regulation of any substance". In October 2009 the government responded to the PASC report rejecting a mandatory register of lobby groups. Instead:
The Alliance for Lobbying Transparency criticised the decisions saying "self-regulation is no regulation"; they compared the situation to that of MPs Expenses scandal.
In August 2009 Transparency International UK received a grant from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust to assess the level of corruption in the United Kingdom for the first time. One motivation for research, which is expected to take 12 months is the "anecdotal evidence and reports in the media suggest that: a) there is a widespread belief that certain institutions and processes within the United Kingdom are vulnerable to corruption, for example, funding of political parties".
Currently, the United Kingdom lobbying sector is self-regulated by the UK Public Affairs Council. This was formed by the Association of Professional Political Consultants, the Public Relations Consultants Association and the Chartered Institute of Public Relations, and held its first meeting in July 2010, chaired by Elizabeth France. However, the PRCA resigned from the UKPAC less than 18 months later, in December 2011, citing concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the UKPAC's register of individual lobbyists.

Neolepetopsidae

Neolepetopsidae is a family of small deep sea sea snails or true limpets, marine gastropod mollusks in the clade Patellogastropoda (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
This family has no subfamilies.
Etymology.
The name of the family Neolepetopsidae is composed of the prefix "neo", which means "new", and the word Lepetopsidae, which is the name of an extinct family of true limpets, from which the species within Neolepetopsidae probably evolved.
Taxonomy.
Two Neolepetosidae species "Eulepetopsis vitrea" and "Paralepetopsis floridensis" were genetically analyzed by Harasewych & McArthur (2000), who confirmed placement of Neolepetopsidae within Acmaeoidea/Lottioidea based on analysis of partial 18S rDNA.
Neolepetopsidae belongs to superfamily Neolepetopsoidea according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Neolepetopsoidea was synonymized with Lottioidea so Neolepetopsidae was moved to superfamily Lottioidea in World Register of Marine Species.
Distribution.
The distribution of the Neolepetopsidae includes the Northeastern Pacific, the western Pacific ("Paralepetopsis rosemariae") and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Habitat.
These limpets live in the deep sea. Their habitat includes hydrothermal vents, whalebone (baleen) and whale-fall habitats.
Genera.
There are currently known 3 genera and altogether 12 species in Neolepetopsidae:

Michael Jackson (journalist)

Naea Michael Jackson is a Niuean journalist and former politician.
In the 1970s and 1980s, he was government printer and government press photographer in Niue. He published the "Tohi Tala Niue", Niue's government-owned weekly newspaper. In 1991, he set up a private printing business, and, in 1993, launched the weekly "Niue Star", which is now the country's only printed newspaper. Jackson is the "Star"’s owner, editor, journalist and photographer.
Also in 1993, Jackson stood successfully for Parliament in that year's general election. He later became an associate minister, and remained a member of Parliament until 2008, when he was defeated in the general election. He stated that there was "no conflict of interest" between his being a journalist and a member of government, because "we have a law to prevent us MPs from taking advantage of our positions".
He is reportedly better known in Niue than his internationally more famous namesake, to the point that, when news of singer Michael Jackson's death reached Niue in July 2009, "most residents of the remote coral atoll (sic) thought that it was him who had died".
Jackson's father's father was English; hence his name.

Arolla Glacier

The Arolla Glacier () is a long glacier (2005) situated in the Pennine Alps in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. In 1973 it had an area of .
The Glacier d'Arolla is in fact composed of two glacier: the "Glacier du Mont Collon" and the "Haut Glacier d'Arolla".
Description.
The Glacier du Mont Collon has a length of almost 5 km and a width of about 1 km at the top. It covers an area of . It begins on the tips of Oren (3525 m) and flows north through a corridor bordered by the Little Mount Collon (3,556 m) and Bishop (3716 m) west, and Mont Collon in the east. It is connected to the west by the glacial Otemma Chermotane Pass (3050 m), a wide passage covered with ice. On the west side of Mount Collon, the glacier undergoes a vertical drop of 600 meters with a slope of 60%.
Bas Glacier.
The part that follows this steep descent is called "Bas Arolla glacier." It continues for about 1 kilometer to the north and the ice tongue stops at an altitude of 2160 meters (status 2007). The glacier emerges from the Borgne d'Arolla which then joins the Borgne Ferpècle then flows into the Val d'Herens before confluence with the Rhone plain.
Haut Glacier d'Arolla.
In the valley located east of Mount Collon is the "Haut Glacier d'Arolla," with a length of 4 km and a width of 1 km. Its area is . It originates from the snowfields hanging north of Mount Brulé (or Mount Braoulé, 3585 m) and then descends with a slope of 12 to 15% towards the northwest and then north. The glacier tongue ends at an altitude of 2550 m (status 2007).

William T. Kane

William T. Kane (September 8, 1932 – September 23, 2008) was a physicist for Corning Incorporated, formerly Corning Glass Works, Inc., in Corning, New York, who held patents in crystallography and heat-sensing technology—developments which contributed to the early processing and manufacture of fiber optics. He was also the Corning representative for the establishment of international standards in the use of fiber optics in communications.
Kane attended the Universities of Colorado, Kansas, and Missouri in Boulder, Lawrence, and Columbia, respectively. He procured his Ph.D. in 1966 in X-Ray crystallography from the University of Missouri.
Kane was also an Air Force officer, having served as a navigator in the Air Force's 55th and 38th Strategic Reconnaissance Wings from 1953 to 1959. As an electronics warfare officer, he participated in the Cold War overflights of the former Soviet Union, espionage missions not disclosed until years later. He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. He was also an Air Force Reserve officer from 1959 to 1966, having departed the military with the rank of captain.
He was born in Jamaica, New York, to Dr. J.T. Kane, a physician and surgeon originally from Brooklyn, and the former Marjory Lillian Davis, a native of London. He subsequently resided and worked in Big Flats, Corning, and Lake Placid, New York. In 1993, he retired to Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was an active skier and sportsman. He was a member of Rotary International and several fraternal and professional associations.
Kane died at Pointe Frontier Retirement Center in Cheyenne after a lengthy illness. He was survived by his wife, Virginia L. "Ginny" Kane (1926–2009); a son, retired Air Force Brigadier General William P. Kane of Colorado Springs; three daughters, Gretchen Gilbert of Cedar Grove, New Jersey, Ellen Jacobson of Reno, Nevada, and Kathleen "Cindy" Lewis of Cheyenne; eight grandchildren; one great-grandson, and two sisters, June Kunz of Keene, New Hampshire, and Phyllis Lazarus of San Jose, California.
Memorial services were held on September 27, 2008, at St. Christopher's Episcopal Church, 2602 Deming Boulevard, in Cheyenne.
Patents.
US Patent 4659435 - Integrally heated electrochemical cell method and apparatus
"A novel electrochemical cell including a solid electrolyte heated to an elevated temperature for operation and an integral cell electrode/heater for heating the electrolyte. Solid electrolyte embodiments are described. The integral electrode/heater is applied to a surface of the solid electrolyte and is resistively heated by an alternating electric current. A portion of the solid electrolyte may also be resistively heated. The described or comparable cells may be incorporated into an oxygen detector or similar apparatus where the apparatus is operated by alternately heating the cell and measuring the emf developed by the cell across its electrode.The invention is also, in part, a unique, solid electrolyte-integral cell electrode/heater configuration which provides a zone of uniform maximum heating at a predetermined location within the electrolyte and which, when used with a suitable resistive heating electric current, confines the current to the integral electrode/heater prolonging cell life. Another aspect of the invention is the use of a radio frequency alternating electric current for resistively heating an electrochemical cell. Preferably, the radio frequency selected is sufficiently high so as to eliminate any offsets in the emf developed by the cell which are caused by the heater current. The invention also includes an apparatus for measuring the concentration of particular gases, such as oxygen, incorporating either and, preferably, both other inventive aspects of the invention. The preferred cell configuration reduces the complexity of such an apparatus by eliminating the auxiliary heat source and provides a more accurate and reliable electrochemical sensing cell. Radio frequency heating allows the operations of cell heating and emf measurement to proceed independent and concurrently and provides a continuously responding, self-heating detection apparatus."
US Patent 4362580 - Furnace and method with sensor
"Oxygen sensor comprising solid oxygen-ion-conducting electrolyte with a platinum group metal film electrode contacts and monitors nonoxidizing or reducing gas atmosphere in a metal heat treatment (gas carburizing) furnace after a getter of the same platinum group metal as in the film electrode removes platinum group metal contaminants from such atmosphere before it contacts the electrode. Getter is held in a thin-walled, multi-passaged honeycomb body."
US Patent 4290586 - Furnace and method with sensor
"Oxygen sensor comprising solid oxygen-ion-conducting electrolyte with a platinum group metal film electrode contacts and monitors nonoxidizing or reducing gas atmosphere in a metal heat treatment (gas carburizing) furnace after a getter of the same platinum group metal as in the film electrode removes platinum group metal contaminants from such atmosphere before it contacts the electrode. Getter is held in a thin-walled, multi-passaged honeycomb body."
US Patent 4277322 - Oxygen sensor
"A metal film electrode on the outer surface of an electroded, oxygen-ion-conducting solid electrolyte, closed end portion of an oxygen sensor tube is maintained in contact with the electrolyte and in its electrical conducting function by a compressible, porous, ceramic boot firmly press-fit onto and over the electroded end portion in slidable and frictional engagement with the outer film electrode (including any connector or reinforcing wire therein or thereon). Boot has open porosity of greater than 50 (or 80) volume percent and can consist essentially of zirconia, such as a sintered mass of zirconia fibers."

Walkers (snack foods)

Walkers is a British snack food manufacturer mainly operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Walkers was founded in 1948 in Leicester, England by Henry Walker, and later bought by Lay's owner PepsiCo. They are best known for manufacturing crisps, and other, non-potato based snack foods. They hold 47 per cent of the British crisp market. The Walkers site in Leicester is one of the largest crisp production plants in the world, producing over 11 million bags of crisps per day and using about 800 tons of potatoes.
History.
In the 1880s Henry Walker moved from Mansfield to Leicester to take over an established butcher's shop in the high street. Meat rationing after World War II saw the factory output drop dramatically and the company looked at alternatives to make use of the wasted capacity. With potato crisps being increasingly popular with the public, managing director R.E. Gerrard helped the company shift focus and began hand-slicing and frying potatoes.
Present day.
Walkers is now owned by PepsiCo with the current logo as a derivative of the North American Lay's logo, and the company is still a significant presence in Leicester. Gary Lineker, formerly a Leicester City footballer, is now the face of the company, featuring in most of their advertising campaigns. The official website states that an estimated "11 million people will eat a Walkers product every day". The company employs over 4,000 people in fifteen locations.
In February 2006, Walkers changed their brand label and typeset. They also announced they were to reduce the saturated fat in their crisps by 70%. They started frying their crisps in "SunSeed" oil, claiming the oil is higher in monounsaturated fat content than the standard sunflower oil which they used previously, establishing their own sunflower farms in Ukraine and Spain to be able to produce sufficient quantities of the oil. Walkers updated their packaging style in June 2007, moving to a brand identity reminiscent of the logo used from 1998–2006.
Many of Walkers brands were formerly branded under the Smiths Crisps name. This comes from the time when Walkers, Smiths and Tudor Crisps were the three main brands of Nabisco's UK snack division with Tudor being marketed mainly in the north of England and Walkers in the south. After the takeover by PepsiCo the Tudor name was dropped and the Smiths brand has become secondary to Walkers. The only products currently retaining the Smiths brand are Salt & Vinegar and Ready Salted Chipsticks, Frazzles and the "Savoury Selection", which includes Bacon Flavour Fries, Scampi Flavour Fries and Cheese Flavoured Moments.
To promote the freshness of its products, Walkers began to package them in foil bags from 1993, then from 1996, began filling them with nitrogen instead of air. 
In 1997, Walkers became the brand name of Quavers and Monster Munch snacks. In August 2000 Walkers launched Max, a brand with a range of crisps. More Max flavours were introduced in 2001. In the same year Walkers bought Squares, a range of snacks from Smiths.
In May 2002 Walkers launched Sensations, a range of crisps in the UK. Walkers introduced the Quavers flavours Salt & Vinegar and Prawn Cocktail in July 2002.
In 2003, Smiths brands Salt & Shake, Scampi Fries and Bacon Fries were relaunched under the Walker's identity. In 2003 Walkers bought Wotsits from Golden Wonder. In July 2004 Walkers launched Wotsits Twisted, a range of cheese puffs in the UK. Nutrition information has appeared on the front of Walkers crisps packets since 2006.
In 2007, Walkers launched Sunbites, a healthier range of lower/better fat crisps made using wholegrains.
In July 2008, Walkers launched its "Do Us A Flavour" campaign, challenging members of the public to think up a unique flavour of crisp. In January 2009 six flavours were picked and released as special editions, available until May 2009. During this period, consumers could vote on their favourite and the winner would become a permanent flavour. The winner of the competition was Builder's Breakfast by Emma Rushin from Belper in Derbyshire. This flavour was itself discontinued a year later in May 2010 in order for Walkers to focus on the upcoming 'Flavour Cup'.
In summer 2009 Walkers launched its premium Red Sky brand of "all natural" potato crisps and snacks.
In April 2010 the company launched a promotional campaign entitled the 'Walkers Flavour Cup' to find the world's favourite flavour. The flavour with the most fans at the end of the tournament would be declared the winner. Walkers encouraged people to engage in social media activity and upload photos and videos to their website proving people's Superfan status of Walkers Crisps. The best fan from each of the 15 flavours won £10,000. In the end, English Roast Beef & Yorkshire Pudding won the flavour cup.
For the 2011 Comic Relief, four celebrities; Jimmy Carr, Stephen Fry, Al Murray and Frank Skinner each represented four new flavours and the three whose crisps sell the least amount would be waxed by Denise Van Outen on 18 March 2011 on Red Nose Day (see below).
In early 2013, Walkers revised their packaging, with a new design and typeface. Slogans such as 'Distinctively Salt & Vinegar' and 'Classically Ready Salted' were added to the front of packs. The previous packaging design had only been around for 12 months. Along with this packaging design came news that the company would start using real meat products in its Smoky Bacon and Roast Chicken flavoured crisps. This prompted substantial opposition from vegetarians, vegans and Muslims, who were now unable to consume the crisps.

The common pack sizes are:
The 50g bag size for the pub trade was produced following a survey by Walkers regarding the average size of a social group in a pub, and the average number of crisps people would take when a bag was passed around; on average, the purchaser should be left with the same weight of crisps in their Grab Bag after passing it around their friends as would be found in a standard 34.5g pack. In 1998 Walkers celebrated their 50th birthday in which they produced limited edition bean bears.

Yank &amp; Doodle

Yank & Doodle are a pair of fictional superhero characters who first appeared in the Prize Publications title "Prize Comics" in 1941.
Fictional biography.
Identical twins Rick and Dick Walters, being too young to enlist in the army during World War II, were still able to fight spies and saboteurs in the United States as the costumed heroes Yank (Rick) and Doodle (Dick). The two of them were super-strong and invulnerable, as long as they were near each other; when apart, they had no superpowers. 
At one point during their career, they teamed up with The Green Lama, the first Black Owl, and many other heroes to fight Frankenstein's monster.
Later, their father Walt became the second Black Owl, having been made the successor of the first one; for the next three years, father and sons worked together as a team, with Yank & Doodle basically being the Owl’s sidekicks. When a bullet wound convinced Walt to retire from active crimefighting, he became an adviser to the boys, who were once again fighting as a duo.
Whatever became of Yank & Doodle after the 1940s is not yet known.
History.
Created by an unknown writer and artist Paul Norris, Yank & Doodle first appeared in "Prize Comics" #13 (August, 1941) as two superheroes who were too young to enlist in the army, but were still able to make a difference in the war effort. Their costumes were identical, except that Yank’s had a letter Y on the front, and Doodle’s a letter D. Their names were derived from the patriotic song "Yankee Doodle".
In issue #24 (October, 1942), the duo took part in a crossover of all the "Prize Comics" heroes, including The Black Owl. In issue #34 (September, 1943), their father Walt became the new Black Owl, and the two titles were merged into one; when dad was sidelined in issue #64 (June, 1947), the boys once again had the spotlight to themselves.
With issue #69 (April, 1948), "Prize Comics" became "Prize Comics Western", and everything that didn’t fit the new Western format — including The Black Owl and Yank & Doodle — was discarded. The three characters have since fallen into the public domain.
In issue #6 of "Project Superpowers", The Black Owl and Yank & Doodle were included in a two-page layout of Golden Age character sketches; in the one-shot "Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude", it was stated that the three of them would appear in the second volume of this comic title, and that Yank & Doodle would be part of a team of kid sidekicks and young superheroes.

Community Center of St Bernard

The Community Center of St Bernard (CCSTB) a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization is located in Arabi, Louisiana, in St Bernard Parish near New Orleans. The Community Center was founded in 2006 to serve local residents after the overwhelming devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. The Center was closed briefly during Hurricane Gustav, but was able to reopen almost immediately after the storm. The purpose of the Community Center is to assist local residents in their return to their homes, and to help normalize life.
History.
The Community Center was founded in 2006 to serve local residents of St. Bernard Parish after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. In St Bernard Parish, the epicenter of devastation, fully 93% of homes were rated as "severely damaged" or "destroyed". This is the only Parish (county) in the history of our country to have been completely inundated by flood waters. In many cases homes and businesses were covered up to the rooftops. One hundred and eighty people in the Parish drowned. It is also the home to the largest residential domestic oil spill in US history, when the Murphy Oil Spill (Chalmette, Louisiana)released more than 1,000,000 gallons of crude oil.
Activities.
The Center is dedicated to providing a wide range of necessary community services, including free food, clothes, hot meals, internet access, free long distance and local phones, computer classes, and community events such as after school programs and workshops. The Community Center also partners with local agencies and gives them space to provide their services at the Center. This program is called the Community Connections Model and effectively turns the Community Center into a one stop shop for recovery resources in Greater New Orleans Area. Some partner agencies include Staff from the Louisiana Department of Social Services, Office of Family Support, Road Home, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Families Helping Families, Red Cross, St Anna’s Medical Mission, Mom & Baby Mobile Health Center, Daughters of Charity, and Swan River Yoga. The Center also hosts a variety of workshops, dances and holiday celebrations that are free to the public.
Community Center Results: 2009.

This is a list of seasons completed by the Toronto Hockey Club of the National Hockey Association. For the list of seasons completed by the Toronto Maple Leafs franchise of the National Hockey League see List of Toronto Maple Leafs seasons. The Toronto Hockey Club, which was also known as the Blue Shirts, competed in the NHA from the 1912-1913 season to midway through the 1916-17 season when the team suspended operations. In the following offseason, the NHA suspended operations, never to return. Four NHA clubs formed the National Hockey League and granted a temporary franchise to an unnamed Toronto 'hockey club' as a replacement for the NHA team in Toronto. However, the roster was composed mostly of former Blue Shirts, leading the press to call this team "the Torontos" or "the Blue Shirts." This temporary franchise would evolve into today's Toronto Maple Leafs.

<doc id="19512765" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19512765" title="EgyptAir Flight 990">
EgyptAir Flight 990

EgyptAir Flight 990 (MS990/MSR990) was a regularly scheduled flight from Los Angeles International Airport, United States to Cairo International Airport, Egypt, with a stop at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. On 31 October 1999, the Boeing 767-300ER operating the route crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about south of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, killing all 217 people on board. The disaster was the third-deadliest aviation incident to have occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, after Air India Flight 182 and Air France Flight 447, and the second-deadliest involving a Boeing 767, after Lauda Air Flight 004.
As the crash occurred in international waters, the responsibility for investigating the accident fell to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA) per International Civil Aviation Organization Annex 13. As the ECAA lacked the resources of the much larger American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Egyptian government asked the NTSB to handle the investigation. Two weeks after the crash, the NTSB proposed handing the investigation over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as the evidence they had gathered suggested a criminal act had taken place and that the crash was intentional rather than accidental. This proposal was unacceptable to the Egyptian authorities, and as such the NTSB continued to lead the investigation. As the evidence of a deliberate crash mounted, the Egyptian government reversed their earlier decision, and the ECAA launched their own investigation. The two investigations came to very different conclusions: the NTSB found the crash was caused by deliberate action of the Relief First Officer Gameel Al-Batouti; the ECAA found the crash was caused by mechanical failure of the airplane's elevator control system.
The Egyptian report suggested several different control failure scenarios as possible causes of the crash, focusing on a possible failure of one of the right elevator's Power Control Units. While the NTSB's report did not determine a specific reason for the Relief First Officer's actions, the primary theory is that he committed suicide. Supporting their deliberate-act conclusion, the NTSB report determined that no mechanical failure scenario could result in airplane movements that matched those recorded by the flight data recorder, and that even had any of the failure scenarios forwarded by the Egyptian authorities occurred, the aircraft would still have been recoverable because of the 767's redundant elevator control system.
Flight details.
Flight 990 was being flown in a Boeing 767-366ER aircraft with the registration SU-GAP, named "Tuthmosis III" after a pharaoh from the 18th Dynasty. The aircraft, a stretched extended-range version of the standard 767, was the 282nd 767 built. It was delivered to EgyptAir as a brand new aircraft on 26 September 1989.
Flight 990's cockpit crew consisted of 57-year-old Captain Ahmed El-Habashi, 36-year-old First Officer Adel Anwar, 52-year-old Relief Captain Raouf Noureldin, 59-year-old Relief First Officer Gameel Al-Batouti and the airline's chief pilot for the Boeing 767, Captain Hatem Rushdy. Captain El-Habashi was a veteran pilot who had been with EgyptAir for more than 35 years and had accumulated 14,384 total flight hours – 6,356 of which were in the 767. Relief First Officer Al-Batouti had 5,191 flight hours in the 767 and a total of 12,538 hours. Because of the scheduled flight time, the flight required two complete flight crews (each consisting of one captain and one first officer). EgyptAir designated one crew as the "active crew" and the other as the "cruise crew" (sometimes also referred to as the "relief crew"). While there was no formal procedure specifying when each crew flew the airplane, it was customary for the active crew to make the takeoff and fly the first four to five hours of the flight. The cruise crew then assumed control of the aircraft until about one to two hours prior to landing, at which point the active crew returned to the cockpit and assumed control of the airplane. EgyptAir designated the Captain of the active crew as the Pilot-in-Command or the Commander of the flight.
While the cruise crew was intended to take over far into the flight, the Relief First Officer entered the cockpit and recommended that he relieve the Command First Officer twenty minutes after takeoff. The Command First Officer initially protested, but eventually agreed.
Passengers.
The flight was carrying 203 passengers from eight countries (Canada, Egypt, Germany, Sudan, Syria, United States, Zimbabwe, and Algeria). Of the people on board, 100 were American, 89 were Egyptian, 22 were Canadian, and the others were of various nationalities.
Of the passengers, four were non-revenue EgyptAir crew members. Of the passengers, 32 boarded in Los Angeles, while the rest boarded in New York. Many of the passengers were elderly Americans who intended to visit Egypt as tourists. Included in the passenger manifest were over 30 Egyptian military officers; among them were two Brigadiers-Generals, a Colonel, a Major, and four other air force officers. After the crash, newspapers in Cairo were prevented by censors from reporting the officers' presence on the flight.
ATC tracking.
U.S. Air Traffic Controllers provided transatlantic flight control operations as a part of the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (referred to in radio conversations simply as "Center" and abbreviated in the reports as "ZNY"). The airspace is divided into "areas," and "Area F" was the section that oversaw the airspace through which Flight 990 was flying. Transatlantic commercial air traffic travels via a system of routes called North Atlantic Tracks, and Flight 990 was the only aircraft at the time assigned to fly North Atlantic Track Zulu. There are also a number of military operations areas over the Atlantic, called "Warning Areas," which are also monitored by New York Center, but records show that these were inactive the night of the accident.
Interaction between ZNY and Flight 990 was completely routine. After takeoff, Flight 990 was handled by three different controllers as it climbed up in stages to its assigned cruising altitude. The aircraft, like all commercial airliners, was equipped with a Mode C transponder, which automatically reported the plane's altitude when queried by the ATC radar. At 01:44, the transponder indicated that Flight 990 had leveled off at FL330. Three minutes later, the controller requested that Flight 990 switch communications radio frequencies for better reception. A pilot on Flight 990 acknowledged on the new frequency. This was the last transmission received from the flight.
The records of the radar returns then indicate a sharp descent:
The plane dropped in 36 seconds. Several subsequent "primary" returns (simple radar reflections without the encoded Mode C altitude information) were received by ATC, the last being at 06:52:05. At 06:54, the ATC controller tried notifying Flight 990 that radar contact had been lost, but received no reply. Two minutes later, the controller contacted ARINC to determine if Flight 990 had switched to an oceanic frequency too early. ARINC attempted to contact Flight 990 on SELCAL, also with no response. The controller then contacted a nearby aircraft, Lufthansa Flight 499, and asked the flight's crew to try to raise Flight 990, but they were unable to make radio contact, although they also reported they were not receiving any Emergency Locator Transmitter signals. Air France Flight 439 was then asked to overfly the last known position of Flight 990, but that crew reported nothing out of the ordinary. Center also provided coordinates of Flight 990's last-known position to Coast Guard rescue aircraft.
Flight recorder data.
The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded the Captain excusing himself to go to the lavatory, followed thirty seconds later by the First Officer saying in Egyptian Arabic "Tawkalt ala Allah", which translates to "I rely on God." A minute later, the autopilot was disengaged, immediately followed by the First Officer again saying, "I rely on God." Three seconds later, the throttles for both engines were reduced to idle, and both elevators were moved three degrees nose down. The First Officer repeated "I rely on God" seven more times before the Captain suddenly asked repeatedly, "What's happening, what's happening?" The flight data recorder reflected that the elevators then moved into a split condition, with the left elevator up and the right elevator down, a condition which is expected to result when the two control columns are subjected to at least of opposing force. At this point, both engines were shut down by moving the start levers from run to cutoff. The Captain asked, "What is this? What is this? Did you shut the engines?" The First Officer did not respond. The Captain repeatedly stated, "Pull with me" but the FDR data indicated that the elevator surfaces remained in a split condition (with the left surface commanding nose up and the right surface commanding nose down) until the FDR and CVR stopped recording. There were no other aircraft in the area. There was no indication that an explosion occurred on board. The engines operated normally for the entire flight until they were shut down. From the presence of a western debris field about from the eastern debris field, the NTSB concluded that the left engine and some small pieces of wreckage separated from the airplane at some point before water impact.
Search and rescue operations.
The aircraft crashed in international waters, so the Egyptian government had the right to initiate its own search and rescue and investigation. Because the government did not have the resources to salvage the aircraft, the Egyptian government requested that the United States lead the investigation. The Egyptian government signed a letter formally ceding responsibility of investigating the accident to the United States.
Search and rescue operations were launched within minutes of the loss of radar contact, with the bulk of the operation being conducted by the United States Coast Guard (USCG). At 03:00, a HU-25 Falcon jet took off from Air Station Cape Cod, becoming the first rescue party to reach the last known position of the plane. All USCG cutters in the area were immediately diverted to search for the aircraft, and an urgent marine information broadcast was issued, requesting mariners in the area to keep a lookout for the downed aircraft.
At sunrise, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy training vessel "Kings Pointer" found an oil sheen and some small pieces of debris. Rescue efforts continued by air and by sea, with a group of USCG cutters covering on 31 October with the hope of locating survivors, but no bodies were recovered from the debris field. Eventually most passengers were identified by DNA from fractured remains recovered from the debris field and the ocean floor. Atlantic Strike Team members brought two truckloads of equipment from Fort Dix to Newport to set up an incident command post. Officials from the Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were dispatched to join the command. The search and rescue operation was eventually suspended on 1 November 1999, with the rescue vessels and aircraft moving instead to recovery operations.
These operations ceased when the naval vessels USS "Grapple" and USNS "Mohawk" and the NOAA research vessel "Whiting" arrived to take over salvage efforts, including recovery of the bulk of the wreckage from the seabed. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered within days by the United States Navy's Deep Drone III submersible. In total a C-130, an H-60 helicopter, the HU-25 Falcon and the Coast Guard cutters "Monomoy", "Spencer", "Reliance", "Bainbridge Island", "Juniper", "Point Highland", "Chinook", and "Hammerhead", along with their supporting helicopters, participated in the search.
A second salvage effort was made in March 2000 that recovered the aircraft's second engine and some of the cockpit controls.
Investigation.
Under the International Civil Aviation Organization treaty, the investigation of an airplane crash in international waters is under the jurisdiction of the country of registry of the aircraft. At the request of the Egyptian government, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) took the lead in this investigation, with the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA) participating. The investigation was supported by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Coast Guard, the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, EgyptAir, and Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Engines.
Two weeks after the crash, the NTSB proposed declaring the crash a criminal event and handing the investigation over to the FBI. Egyptian government officials protested, and Omar Suleiman, head of Egyptian intelligence, traveled to Washington to join the investigation.
Hamdi Hanafi Taha defection.
In February 2000, EgyptAir 767 captain Hamdi Hanafi Taha sought political asylum in London after landing his aircraft there. In his statement to British authorities, he claimed to have knowledge of the circumstances behind the crash of Flight 990. He is reported to have said that he wanted to "stop all lies about the disaster," and to put much of the blame on EgyptAir management.
Reaction was swift, with the NTSB and FBI sending officials to interview Taha, and Osama El-Baz, an advisor to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, saying, "This pilot can't know anything about the plane; the chances that he has any information the crash of Flight 990 are very slim." EgyptAir officials also immediately dismissed Taha's claim. Taha's information was reportedly of little use to the investigators, and his application for asylum was turned down.
Taha's statements provide a possible motive for why al-Batouti may have deliberately crashed the plane. According to Taha, the officer had recently been demoted by an Egypt Air executive, who was on board the plane.
NTSB investigation and conclusion.
The NTSB's investigation fairly quickly centered on the actions of the Relief First Officer, Gameel Al-Batouti, and this drew relatively minor criticism from Egyptians. The NTSB determined that the only way for the observed split elevator condition to occur was if the left seat pilot (the Captain's position) was commanding nose up while the right seat pilot (the First Officer's position) commanded nose down. As the Egyptian investigation forwarded various mechanical failure scenarios, they were each tested by the NTSB and found not to match the factual evidence. The NTSB concluded that no mechanical failure scenario either they or the Egyptians could come up with matched the evidence on the ground, and that even if mechanical failure had been experienced, the 767's design made the situation recoverable.
The NTSB's final report was issued on 21 March 2002, after a two-year investigation, and concluded as follows:
ECAA investigation and conclusion.
After formally ceding responsibility for the investigation of the accident to the NTSB, the Egyptian authorities became increasingly unhappy with the direction the investigation was heading. As such, the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority launched their own investigation in the weeks following the accident.
The ECAA report concluded as follows:
William Langewiesche, an aviation journalist, said "Whereas in the case of the Egyptians, they were following a completely different line of thinking. It seemed to me that they knew very well that their man, Batouti, had done this. They were pursuing a political agenda that was driven by the need to answer to their higher-ups in a very pyramidal, autocratic political structure. The word had been passed down from on high, probably from Mubarak himself, that there was no way that Batouti, the co-pilot, could have done this. For the accident investigators in Egypt, the game then became not pursuing the truth but backing the official line."
Responses to reports.
The investigation and its results drew criticism from the Egyptian government, which advanced several alternative theories about mechanical malfunction of the aircraft. In Western countries, the Egyptian rejection of the NTSB report was attributed to a strong Egyptian cultural aversion to suicide. The theories proposed by Egyptian authorities were tested by the NTSB, and none were found to match the facts. For example, an elevator assembly hardover (in which the elevator in a fully extended position sticks because the hinge catches on the tail frame) proposed by the Egyptians was discounted, because the flight recorder data showed the elevator was in a "split condition." In this state, one side of the elevator is up and the other down; on the
767, this condition is only possible through flight control input (i.e., one yoke is pushed forward, the other pulled backward).
There was some evidence that one of the right side elevator Power Control Units may have suffered a malfunction, and the Egyptian investigation mentioned this as a likely cause of the crash. While noting that the damage did indeed exist, the NTSB countered that it was more than likely caused by the accident rather than existing beforehand, and furthermore it wasn't enough to cause the crash as the 767 is designed to remain flyable even with two PCUs failed.
In response to the claim of NTSB unprofessionalism by the Egyptian Civilian Authority, Bernard Loeb, former NTSB director of aviation safety, said
Another discredited theory, posited by literature professor Elaine Scarry, proposed that Flight 990 was subjected to electromagnetic interference by military aircraft. In a critique of Scarry's writing, Didier de Fontaine, professor emeritus of materials science at UC Berkeley, discussed the lack of scientific basis for Scarry's hypothesis and stated that she had engaged in "voodoo science".
Media coverage.
While the official investigation was proceeding, speculation about the crash ran rampant in both the Western media and the Egyptian press.
Western media speculation.
Long before the NTSB had issued its final report, Western media began to speculate about the meaning of the taped cockpit conversations and about possible motives (including suicide and terrorism) behind Al-Batouti's actions on the flight. The speculation, in part, was based on leaks from an unnamed federal law enforcement official that the crew member in the co-pilot's seat was recorded as saying, "I made my decision now. I put my faith in God's hands."
During a press conference held on 19 November 1999, the NTSB's Jim Hall denounced such speculation and said that it had "done a disservice to the long-standing friendship between the people of the United States of America and Egypt."
On 20 November 1999, the Associated Press quoted senior American officials as saying that the quotation was not in fact on the tape. It is believed that the speculation arose from a mistranslation of an Egyptian Arabic phrase (Tawkalt ala Allah) meaning "I rely on God."
London's "Sunday Times", quoting unnamed sources, speculated that the Relief First Officer had been "traumatized by war," and was depressed because many members of his fighter squadron in the 1973 war had been killed.
The unprecedented presence of 33 members of the Egyptian General Staff on the flight (contrary to standard operating procedure) fed a number of conspiracy theories. There were those who opined that it was an action (and potentially a conspiracy) of Muslim extremists against Egypt. Others countered that Mossad had targeted them.
Egyptian media reaction and speculation.
The Egyptian media reacted in outrage to the speculations in the Western press. The state-owned "Al Ahram Al Misri" called Al-Batouti a "martyr," and the Islamist "Al Shaab" covered the story under a headline that stated, "America's goal is to hide the truth by blaming the EgyptAir pilot."
At least two Egyptian newspapers, "Al Gomhuria" and "Al-Musawar", offered theories that the aircraft was accidentally shot down by the U.S. Other theories were advanced by the Egyptian press as well, including the Islamist "Al Shaab", which speculated that a Mossad/CIA conspiracy was to blame (since, supposedly, EgyptAir and El Al crews stay at the same hotel in New York). "Al Shaab" also accused U.S. officials of secretly recovering the FDR, reprogramming it, and throwing it back into the water to be publicly recovered.
Unifying all the Egyptian press was a stridently held belief that it "is inconceivable that a pilot would kill himself by crashing a jet with 217 people aboard. 'It is not possible that anyone who would commit suicide would also kill so many innocent people alongside him,' said Ehab William, a surgeon at Cairo's Anglo-American Hospital," reported the "Cairo Times".
The Egyptian media also reacted against Western speculation of terrorist connections. The "Cairo Times" reported, "The deceased pilot's nephew has lashed out in particular against speculation that his uncle could have been a religious extremist. 'He loved the United States,' the nephew said. 'If you wanted to go shopping in New York, he was the man to speak to, because he knew all the stores.'"
Reaction of the Egyptian public.
William Langewiesche, an aviation writer, said that in Cairo he encountered three groups of people. He said that the ordinary Cairenes believed that there was an American conspiracy to attack EgyptAir 990 and that the Americans were covering up the fact. He added that a small group of Cairenes, mostly consisting of "intelligentsia", "knew perfectly well that Batouti, the co-pilot, had pushed that airplane into the water, and that the Egyptian government was stonewalling and was engaged in what they saw as a typical exercise in Egyptian governing." Langewiesche said that "people involved directly in the investigation" had "presented a uniform party line, a uniform face with very few cracks. They stonewalled me, and that in itself was very interesting." Langewiesche argued that "in the stonewalling they were revealing themselves" and that if they truly believed Batouti was innocent, they would have invited Langewiesche to see proof that Batouti was innocent.
Dramatization.
The story of the flight has been featured in the Discovery Channel Canada/National Geographic television show "Mayday" ("Air Crash Investigation", "Air Emergency"). In the show, the flight is dramatized on the basis of ATC tapes as well as the CVR recordings. In interviews conducted for the program, the Relief First Officer's family members vehemently dispute the suicide/deliberate crash theories and dismiss them as biased. The program nevertheless concludes that he crashed the plane for personal reasons: he had been severely reprimanded by his boss for sexual harassment, and this boss was actually on the plane.
The dramatization of the crash also depicts the Relief First Officer forcing the plane down while the Command Captain attempts to pull the plane up. Despite this, upon conclusion the program stresses the official NTSB conclusion, which makes no mention of a suicide mission. Rather, it simply states that the crash was a direct result of actions made by the co-pilot for ""unknown"" reasons.
"Al Jazeera", an Arabic-language channel, produced a documentary about the flight that was transmitted in March 2000. The documentary looked at the official NTSB report and speculations surrounding it. In the documentary, the NTSB data were used with a flight simulator of the same plane model to try to simulate the circumstances of the crash.
Flight number.
Since the crash, the flight number for New York City to Cairo has been changed from 990 to MS986. The route is now flown by a Boeing 777. The airline also terminated service to Los Angeles.

Orenco (aircraft manufacturer)

Orenco was an American aircraft manufacturer founded in 1916 in New York as Ordnance Engineering Corporation. Confusion with the Ordnance Branch of the US Army led to the shortening of the name in 1919. The company's first project was the Orenco A in 1917, but they received no orders for it. The Orenco B and C received small orders, but the Orenco D was the most successful of their aircraft. The USAAS bought four prototypes, but the order for 50 production aircraft was given to the lowest bidder, in this case Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company.
Orenco's projects in civil aviation failed as well, due to the number of aircraft available after the end of World War I. The company consequently went out of business.

Giétro Glacier

The Giétro Glacier or Giétroz Glacier () is a 4 km long valley glacier located in south-western Switzerland. The 1818 Giétro Glacier catastrophe, which led to lake outburst flood, is one of the most famous and most disastrous historical cases in the Swiss Alps.
Description.
The Giétro Glacier lies on the northern side of the Pennine Alps in the Swiss canton of Valais. It is located in the upper Bagnes Valley, south of Martigny and Verbier. The length of the glacier is 4.55 km (1979) and its area is 5.85 km2 (1979).
The glacier is fed by the snows of Mont Blanc de Cheilon (3,870 m) and La Ruinette (3,875 m). On the upper part, the glacier is relatively flat. It descends to the north on the side of Mont Rouge du Giétro and then curves to the west between Le Pleureur and Mont Rouge. On the lower part, the glacier reaches a steepness of 40% forming a large number of crevasses. The terminus is located at about 2,600 metres. Part of the glacier is linked to the Cheilon Glacier through the Col du Cheilon (3,243 m). The water generated by the glacier ends in the Lake Mauvoisin (artificial lake) and then reaches the Dranse de Bagnes, a tributary of the Rhone.
Glacier catastrophes.
The Giétro Glacier is known to have caused many deaths in the valley during historical times. A first glacial lake outburst flood was recorded in 1595, causing 140 deaths. More recently in 1818 a similar lake outburst flood occurred killing 44 people. In the latter case a hole was drilled through the glacier to limit the level of waters.
After an increase of the glacier, an ice cone formed in the valley between 1816-1818. It was created by the accumulation of the falling seracs of the terminus. A lake was formed but it emptied on 27 May 1817 without causing any fatalities. In April 1818 the lake measured about 2 km in length. On 10 May 1818, the engineer Ignace Venetz was called by the canton. To stop the rapid rise of waters, he decided to drill a hole through the ice. The work began one day later. A tunnel was drilled from the two sides, about 20 metres above the level of the lake. An avalanche of ice occurred on 18 May but without any casualties. A secondary tunnel was then drilled for safety reasons. A week later the level of the lake reached 10 metres below the tunnel. On 27 May an enormous piece of ice detached itself from the cone in the lake and floated to the surface while making terrible noise; everybody escaped. They went back to work 2 days later. The 198 metre-long hole was completed on 4 June. Other large pieces of ice detached from the cone and floated back. The waters finally reached the level of the hole on 13 June, 22 p.m. They continued to rise until 14 June, when the level of the lake began to fall because of the erosion of the hole by the waterfall. Some water also ran out from the base of the cone. Only 2 men stayed in place; Venetz warned the inhabitants of the valley of the danger. On the morning of 16 June, terrible noises and violent detonations were heard. The cone began to crack. A group of British tourists and a drawer from Lausanne visited the place with Venetz. In the afternoon, Venetz and the workers escaped to the heights of Fionnay.
Finally, at 4.30 p.m., the dam broke and 18 million m3 of water invaded the valley. Half an hour later the lake was empty. The flood reached the village of Bagnes 10 minutes later; the alert was given to Martigny before 6 p.m. but too late. The wave invaded Martigny-Bourg a few minutes later. The rise of the waters was observed along the Rhone, at 19 p.m. in Saint Maurice and at 23 p.m. on Lake Geneva.

Siraya language

Siraya is a Formosan language spoken until the end of the 19th century by the indigenous Siraya people of Taiwan. Dialects of Siraya included Taivoa and Makatao.
Several Siraya communities have been involved in a Sirayan cultural and language revitalization movement for more than a decade. Through linguistic research and language teaching, the natives are 'awaking' their mother tongue that has been 'dormant' for a century. Today a group of Siraya children in the Shinhua township particularly in Kou-pei and Chiou Chen Lin area are able to speak and sing in the Siraya language.
Dialects.
The Siraya dialects (or sometimes Sirayaic languages) are:
Paul Jen-kuei Li (2009) attempted a classification.
However, Li (2009) found two conflicting trees:
1. "Tree based on the number of phonological innovations"
2. "Tree based on the relative chronology of sound changes"
Li (2009) considers the second tree (the one containing the Taivuan–Makatau group) to be the somewhat more likely one.
Sources.
The Siraya language entered the historical record in the early 17th century when traders from the Dutch East India Company, expelled from mainland China and Chinese waters, set up a stronghold on Taiwan at Fort Zeelandia, which was in the Siraya-speaking area. During the period of Dutch rule in Taiwan, Calvinist missionaries used Siraya and Babuza (also known as "Favorlang") as contact languages. A translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew into Siraya (174 pages of Siraya and Dutch text, Gravius 1661) and a catechism in Siraya (288 pages of Siraya and Dutch text, Gravius 1662) were published, and have been subsequently republished. The Dutch colony was driven out in 1661 by Ming loyalist refugees from China, and Taiwan was subsequently incorporated into the Qing Empire. During the period of Qing Dynasty rule, use of Siraya receded, but some Siraya language materials survive in the form of Siraya land contracts with Chinese translations, known as the Sinckan Manuscripts. The last records were lists of words made in the early 19th century.
The Tainan Ping-pu Siraya Association is compiling the first modern-day Siraya glossary. Publication is scheduled for November 2008.
Phonology.
The phonological system of Siraya is speculated by Adelaar (1997) to have the following phonemes.

Robert Broke

Sir Robert Broke SL (died 5 0r 6 September 1558) was a British justice, politician and legal writer. Although a landowner in rural Shropshire, he made his fortune through more than 20 years' service to the City of London. MP for the City in five parliaments, he served as Speaker of the House of Commons in 1554. He is celebrated as the author of one of the Books of authority. A prominent religious conservative, he founded a notable recusant dynasty. His surname is also rendered Brooke, and occasionally Brook, which are, for modern readers, better indicators of pronunciation.
Early life and education.
Robert Broke was born by 1515: his known Oxford admission date suggests the first decade of the century. He was the eldest son of
Most of early 16th century Shropshire was poor and underdeveloped sheep country, ruled by the Council of Wales and the Marches. Claverley was a large parish, dominated by the Gatacre family, whose seat was at its southern edge.
Broke was admitted to study for a BA at Oxford university in 1521. As a very minor member of the landed gentry, Broke needed to seek sources of income outside his own locality if he were to prosper, and he did so through London and the law. He studied at Strand Inn, and from there was admitted to Middle Temple at some point between 1525 and 1528. He studied pleading with John Jenour, a famous Prothonotary who influenced a whole generation of judges and jurists.
Judicial career.
Broke enjoyed considerable power as an official of the City of London before attaining high office in the last four years of his life. He was also the author of several important works on the law.
Offices held.
Broke's judicial career began in 1536 when he was appointed Common Serjeant of London on the recommendation of Henry VIII and the queen, Jane Seymour; how he gained such royal favour is unknown. As Serjeant, Brooke attended court with the Lord Mayor of London, as well as the Court of Aldermen and the Court of Common Council, the City's main deliberative body. One of his tasks was to review, rewrite and put forward parliamentary bills proposed by the City. In January 1544 he was directed to intervene in the passage of two bills: one from the secondaries of the compter, aiming to repeal the Act against untrue verdicts; another already put to the house that intended to prevent merchants buying steel and other goods, which Broke was told to forestall. In 1545 it was a bill to bring urban sanctuaries under the control of borough and city authorities.
Among the legal officers, the Common Serjeant was second only to the Recorder of London. When this post became vacant in 1545, a letter from the king to the Aldermen once again proved decisive in securing it for Broke, and he took office on 12 November. On 17 November he was elected to parliament in place of his predecessor as Recorder, Sir Roger Cholmley. On 19 November he was granted Freedom of the City of London, a status tied to his membership of the Worshipful Company of Mercers, the first in order of precedence of London's Livery Companies.
Holding these public offices did not prevent Broke pursuing private practice, and his signature is found on bills in chancery in the 1530s and 1540s. During this time he was also deputy chief steward for the Duchy of Lancaster, and was created a Serjeant-at-law in 1552.
On 8 October 1554 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, probably a reward from Queen Mary for his performance as Speaker of the House of Commons. He was knighted on 27 January 1555 by King Philip. On 26 February, he presided over the trial of Charles Stourton, 8th Baron Stourton, accused of murdering two men, William Hartgill and his son John. Stourton refused to plead and Broke threatened him with the punishment of being pressed to death. He then entered a plea of guilty and was executed on 16 March.
Broke fell into conflict with the court's Puisne Justices when he appointed Thomas Gatacre, his wife's brother, as Chief Prothonotary in 1557. The justices rejected him, and Broke's second choice, William Wheteley, was then allowed to take office despite judicial preference for another candidate.
Works.
In 1542 Broke became a bencher at the Middle Temple. As Autumn Reader that year, his subject was the 1540 Statute of Limitations; the reading circulated in manuscript and was subsequently printed in 1547. As Lent Reader in 1551, his subject was Pleas of the Crown, using chapter 18 of Magna Carta as the source: this also circulated in manuscript before being published in 1641, almost one hundred years after his death.
Broke's most important work was "La Graunde Abridgement", a classified compendium of law as it then prevailed. Modelled on a work of the same name by Anthony Fitzherbert, with which it is sometimes confused, it closely reflected Broke's own interests and experience. A section is given over to the subject of London, great stress is placed on the role of parliament and it contains numerous cases in which Broke appeared. The book was not published until 1568, a decade after Broke's death, and was in Law French, but it was an immediate success and came to be regarded as one of the Books of authority which courts can use as evidence of the law prevailing at the time. From it Richard Bellewe extracted important cases decided during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I and issued them as a separate compilation, soon rendered into English, and often cited as Brook's New Cases. This proved even more popular than the book from which it was extracted.
Political career.
Broke served as a Member of Parliament for the City of London from 1545 until 1554, serving as Speaker of the House of Commons of England in 1554.
Parliament of 1545.
Broke was elected to the Parliament of 1545, the last of Henry VIII's reign, as a replacement for Sir Roger Cholmley. The parliament had been called as long ago as December 1544 and Cholmley was elected to Parliament on 19 January 1545. However, the opening of parliament was delayed until 23 November and Cholmley was appointed an Exchequer Baron in the mean time, and so forced to relinquish both his post as Recorder and his parliamentary seat.
London had four MPs. Two, called "knights", were elected by the Aldermen, and one of these was always the Recorder. The other two, called "burgesses" were elected by the Court of Common Council from a list of twelve proposed by the Aldermen. The Recorder always resigned his seat when he left office: hence Broke's election was automatic. London was second only to the Crown as sponsor of legislation and solid legal acumen was in need at all times among its delegation to the House of Commons.
Broke's colleagues in the 1545 parliament were Sir Richard Gresham, a former Lord Mayor, John Sturgeon, a staunch Protestant, and Paul Withypoll, a wealthy merchant with interests in the Netherlands, Spain and Crete. Much of their work involved defending the City against the claims of its clergy. They were unsuccessful in getting their bill on sanctuaries through the House, but they were able to force a compromise over a bill intended to tighten up tithe collection from the citizens. Such manoeuvring was typical of the concerns of London members in the Tudor period.
Parliament of 1547.
The first Parliament of Edward VI lasted for most of the reign, and Broke was automatically returned to it. His aldermanic colleague was the goldsmith Sir Martin Bowes, who had just served his term as Lord Mayor, having made so large a fortune at the Royal Mint that he was able easily to afford the £10,000 to settle accounts when he and the other masters were found to have systematically debased the coinage. Bowes remained a London MP throughout Broke's term, apart from a short break in 1553. The first session of the parliament definitively abolished chantries. A major concern of the London members in the second and subsequent sessions of the parliament was to ensure that the City did not lose control of the wealth of the chantries within its boundaries to the king. Broke, who had been appointed commissioner for chantries in London, Westminster and Middlesex in 1546, during an earlier and abortive move toward abolition, must have had first-hand knowledge of the subject. The London members also wrestled with an Act to release fee farms for three years to ensure that London got the best terms from it. Broke was told to work closely with one of the burgesses, who had specialist knowledge of the subject. The other burgess, Thomas Curteys, was elected an alderman in 1551 – a move which he resisted to the point of imprisonment and which forced him to resign his seat in parliament. In 1552 Broke was sent to lobby for further assurances from the Crown about lands recently purchased by the City.
Broke was not limited to purely metropolitan concerns: as a skilled lawyer and draftsman, his talents were useful to the Crown and its ministers, and he was called upon by others if they thought his skills could benefit their cause. In 1549, He was given responsibility for a bill "for preaching divers opinions." The third session of the parliament passed an Act to reform canon law and Broke was appointed to the commission set up for this purpose on 12 February 1552. In March 1552 he was one of those deputed to the redraft the Treason Act 1551 to make it illegal to say that the king "is an heretic, schismatic, infidel or usurper of the crown." He was one of those enlisted in 1549 by the supporters of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, whose family had long held the shrievalty of Westmorland by hereditary right: the supporters of his neighbour Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton, were proposing to end the arrangement. He was also called in by John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford in 1552 to advise on legislation he was promoting to free himself of commitments made to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, the disgraced and executed former Lord Protector.
Parliament of March 1553.
Broke and Bowes were sent to the last parliament of Edward VI's reign, along with two burgesses: Curteys's replacement, John Blundell, and John Marshe – both Protestants and particularly long-serving MPs. The parliament met as the succession question loomed large and lasted for only the month of March 1553. However, the London delegation were initially more concerned with their campaign to get the use of fuel in London better regulated – in which they succeeded through the passage of an Act.
However, Broke was soon given the question of the Maidstone election to investigate, and this was perhaps a result of the succession crisis. The town had been granted a charter of incorporation in 1549. An election was called as soon as the parliament was summoned, but there was no reference to parliamentary representation in the charter. Broke was joined in his work by Richard Morgan, a fellow judge and MP for Gloucester, as well as a fellow Catholic. They were enjoined by parliament to "peruse the charter of Maidstone ... whether they may have burgesses in this House; and in the meantime the burgesses there to be absent out of this House till it be fully ordered." It was possible that supporters of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland had used Maidstone's ambiguous status as a way of increasing parliamentary support for Lady Jane Grey's succession, as the town was in the Protestant heartland of Kent. In fact, the lord of the manor was Thomas Wyatt, the High Sheriff of Kent who made the return was Sir John Guildford, a cousin of Dudley's wife, and one of the burgesses elected was a relative of both Dudley and Jane Grey. It is unclear what Broke and Morgan reported, or even if they delivered their report, but Maidstone was disfranchised and did not regain the right to parliamentary representation until it was granted by a new charter 1559.
Parliaments of Mary I.
For the parliament of October 1553 Bowes was temporarily replaced by Sir Rowland Hill, a former Lord Mayor and a Protestant, making Broke the only Catholic MP from London. Despite this, and the momentous events of the summer, in which Dudley attempted to place Jane Grey on the throne and was defeated by a rebellion in favour of Mary, Edward's Catholic elder sister, the London delegation attended the parliament with an entirely commercial agenda. They toiled away at legislation to regulate London's physicians, chandlers in both wax and tallow, leather tanners and bowling alleys, as well as a measure to deregulate the sale of wine. However, the Crown took initial steps to undo the Edwardian Reformation. One of the key measures protecting it was the Treason Act, which Broke had helped to redraft. After a bill to repeal it had passed its second reading, it was given to Broke to review and steer through its final stages.
The parliament of April 1554 had a much stronger commission to further the Marian Counter-Reformation: "for corroboration of true religion, and touching the Queen's highness most noble marriage" to Philip II of Spain. Broke attended with Bowes, Blundell and Marshe. At the assembly of the parliament Broke was elected speaker, probably with royal support. The parliament was dissolved after only a month. The Speaker's main task was to steer through a bill, dear to many members, to protect those who had profited from the Dissolution of the monasteries from ecclesiastical censure. This he did competently, although the bill was defeated in the House of Lords. The main measures proposed by the Crown, most importantly those relating to the Queen's marriage, were carried expeditiously. Broke's conduct as Speaker seems to have been the main factor influencing the Queen to open up opportunities within the judiciary. He was appointed Chief Justice of Common Pleas after the summoning of the next parliament but before it assembled. This forced him to resign the recordership, and thus his Commons seat.
Landowner.
Broke's family had been decidedly minor landowners in and around Claverley. However, his career gave him the contacts and wealth to expand his holdings greatly. He was able to purchase land and rights expropriated through the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII and the abolition of chantries and colleges in the reiign of Edward VI.
Most important for Broke's family was the acquisition of the manor of Madeley, Shropshire, which had been the closest demesne estate of Wenlock Priory. After passing back to the Crown in 1540 on the dissolution of the priory, it was purchased by Broke in 1544 and held as half a knight's fee. For two centuries Madeley was to be the seat of the Brooke family, famous or notorious for their royalist plotting during the Civil War and Commonwealth. In the same year, Broke also bought the advowson of the parish church. and in 1549 the property of St Mary's guild, a lay fraternity that had tended the Lady chapel. He even purchased the pension that the rector of Badger, Shropshire had paid to Wenlock Madeley's mineral wealth was already partly apparent: there had been coal mining since the 14th century and there was already an iron ore working rented out when Broke bought the manor. It was to prove one of the focal points of England's Industrial Revolution.
In 1548 Broke bought the manor of Lapley from Sir Richard Manners. Formerly the demesne estate of Lapley Priory, this had been granted by Henry V to the College of St Bartholomew, Tong, Shropshire, which was the shrine church of the Vernon family of Haddon Hall. Manners acquired it at the abolition of colleges and chantries and was now in a position to sell this former church property for ready cash. Broke settled Lapley on his second wife, Dorothy Gatacre, at their marriage and she obtained it on his death.
Broke's family resided generally in Shropshire. He visited Shropshire periodically to meet family and friends, but most of the time lived in one of his London houses, at Carter Lane or in Putney.
Religious beliefs.
Opinions on Broke's religious beliefs differ only in degree. The History of Parliament says: "There seems no doubt that Broke was a Catholic." The 1904 Dictionary of National Biography volume quotes, without attribution, the description "zealous Catholic," while The Victoria County history on his main manor echoes with the more disparaging "zealous papist." In 1548, it was reported that Broke and Clement Smith, MP for Maldon, "when they heard the priest at St. Gregory's by Paul's at his prayers at mass pray God to send the Council grace to turn from their erroneous opinions that they were in", although the allegation was later withdrawn.
Broke's religious conservatism was a persistent theme of his life. He had served as commissioner for heresies for London in 1541, when Henry VIII's final persecution of Protestants was launched. The commission to Edmund Bonner, the Bishop of London is faithfully preserved in Foxe's Book of Martyrs, with a list of the names of those whose oaths were to be taken, including notably Broke himself, Cholmley and Gresham. However, in common with the Shropshire and Staffordshire gentry circle in which he moved, Brooke showed no great sympathy for the power and wealth of the clergy. He worked to limit the power of the London clergy and later readily accepted lands expropriated from monasteries and chantries, using his power as Speaker to attempt to secure the purchasers.
However, Broke's attitude was generally strictly professional: he was willing to use his legal skills on behalf of employers or clients, irrespective of their religious inclinations or intentions, so it is never entirely safe to read his beliefs from his actions. Hence he worked on both the passage and the repeal of the 1551 Treason Act, which specifically forbade religious criticism of Edward VI. It was never likely that he would appear on the October 1553 Crown Office list of MPs as one of "those which stood for the true religion," in this case, Protestant. Only 60 names are marked, although they include his colleagues: Blundell and Marshe.
Broke married within his own Catholic regional circle: the Gatacres were to become mainly recusants, as were his own descendants.
Death.
Broke's inquisition post mortem records that he died on 5 September 1558 at Patshull Hall. However, his tomb inscription says that he died on 6 September, while "visiting his friends and country". The discrepancy is small and it is possible he died in the night, with the precise moment unknown. He was buried in Claverley Church. His chest tomb bears his effigy, clad in his gown of office, lying between his two wives, with his children in miniature around the sides. It is by far the finest tomb in the church.
Broke's will was dated 7 January 1558. The executors of the will included Humphrey Moseley, a young lawyer and MP who was a close friend of Broke. The overseers were William Gatacre, his father-in-law; John and Richard Broooke, his eldest son by each marriage; and Richard Whorwood, his "clerk and cousin". Whorwood very briefly took wardship of John, as he reached his twenty-first birthday in June 1559. The estates were divided between John and Richard, although the widow, Dorothy, had Lapley and retained Madeley until her death. The other sons were given £40 each, with the proviso that they take up study or trade to earn a living "meet for a gentleman's son."
Family.
Broke married twice and his will shows that he had seventeen children in all. His wives were:

Turritella communis

Turritella communis, common name the "common tower shell" is a species of medium-sized sea snails with an operculum, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Turritellidae.
Distribution and habitat.
This species occurs in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean from the Lofoten Isles south to the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa. It is rare or absent from the eastern English Channel and the southern North Sea. This tower shell can be found in the sublittoral zone to depths up to 200 m, where it is usually found burrowed in gravelly mud at an angle of about 10°. There it remains stationary for long periods. It can be locally abundant on muddy sediment in shallow waters.
Fossil and subfossil shells of "Turritella communis" have been found in interglacial strata in the North Sea, from the Late Pliocene to the Quaternary Period.
Description.
The tall, conical shell is brownish-yellow to white. It is sharply pointed and contains 16-20 enlarged whorls. The spiral ridges are numerous (with 3 - 6 more prominent) and may have a beaded appearance. The shell grows to a length of 3 cm and may become 1 cm wide. The angulate shell aperture is small. The outer lip is crenulate. There is no umbilicus. The concave operculum is small and circular and has numerous pinnate bristles on its edges.
The snail shows white markings on the tentacles, siphon and foot. This small foot shows dark spots and streaks.
Feeding habits.
"Turritella communis" feeds on deposits through ciliary feeding. In order to prevent larger particles entering the mantle cavity, it possesses at the mantle edge a curtain of tentacles of which the larger ones are pinnate.

Berle Church

Berle Church () is a local church community center "(arbeidskyrkje)" in the village of Berle in Bremanger Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. The church is part of the Berle parish in the Nordfjord deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The church, which can seat 210 persons, was consecrated on 3 July 1977 by Bishop Thor With. The architect Alf Apelseth from Ørsta made the designs. In 1977, Berle became a chapel district in the Rugsund parish. In 1981, Berle was transferred to the Bremanger parish. On 1 October 1999, the parish of Berle was established. At that time, Berle chapel became Berle church.
Building.
Berle Church has obvious similarities to the Nordsida Church in nearby Stryn Municipality and the interior is designed in the same way. The chancel is separated from the nave by a simple, square altar rail. The room is light, marked by the white concrete walls and the pine-panelled slanted ceiling, with narrow windows on the sides. On the side of the main room there are partition walls to the smaller assembly room, but both rooms are used for the major church services. The small assembly room is normally used for various club activities, festive occasions, church coffees, funerals, as well as meetings of the church council. The kitchen is also used as a baptismal vestry, whereas the vicar's vestry is located to the right of the chancel.
History.
Berle Church is one of the most modern churches in the county is located on the island of Bremangerlandet along the Frøysjøen strait. It was built four years after the similar Nordsida Church was built at Roset in Stryn. In the village of Berle, people had worked almost as long as the people in the village of Roset to get a church of their own. In the former case, however, it was not a discussion of location which slowed down the process, but rather the fact that other projects were given priority.
The unpredictable weather conditions on the Frøysjøen strait make it easy to understand that people wanted to have their own church at Berle. For centuries they had gone to the nearby Rugsund Church, and they had experienced their fair share of dramatic episodes on their way to church. To make matters worse, it took close to four hours by boat and car to get to the church and back. The school was the only house they could use for assemblies, but around 1900, more and more people agreed that it was time to start the process of getting their own church. Things improved a little when the village of Berle got their own graveyard in 1893, next door to the present church site. The small chapel by the graveyard was also a blessing, because people could congregate there before the coffins were lowered into the ground. Nevertheless, a church of their own was high on the list of the local population.
Around 1910, the Berle district applied to become a separate chapel district, but the Rugsund parish council put off dealing with the application, and eventually turned it down. But the inhabitants on the eastern side of Bremangerlandet refused to give up. In 1911, they started raising money to build a church. Finally, in 1963, things started moving in the right direction when a special committee was appointed to work for a more targeted approach in the church cause. Bishop Per Juvkam's visit to Berle was also an inspiration for their cause. Later on, he took the initiative to let the people of Berle use the same design for the church as the congregation at Kilsfjord in Sunnmøre had done for their church, a cooperation the village of Roset later on joined in. The municipal council of Davik was also in favour of these plans (Berle was part of Davik municipality at that time).
There was cause for optimism in the local community until the extensive changes in municipal borders that took place in 1965, when the part of Davik municipality which included Berle was transferred to the municipality of Bremanger. In the new and bigger municipality other things proved to be more important than building a church at Berle. In 1975, the municipal council of Bremanger finally resolved to build the long-awaited chapel. Bishop Per Juvkam was also a very happy man when he returned to Berle on 21 May 1976 to lay the foundation stone for the chapel. The following year, on 3 July 1977, his successor, bishop Thor With, came to Berle to consecrate this modern church building.

Projected

Projected is an American rock supergroup consisting of Sevendust members John Connolly and Vinnie Hornsby, Alter Bridge and Creed drummer Scott Phillips, and former Submersed guitarist Eric Friedman. The band released one album, "Human", in June 2012, before falling into inactivity as Connolly and Hornsby returned to Sevendust in late 2012.
History.
The band recorded as a four piece, with each of the members coming from different bands. John Connolly and Vinnie Hornsby had both played together for many years in the alternative metal band Sevendust, as the guitarist and bassist respectively. Eric Friedman had previously been the guitarist for the now-defunct band Submersed, and Scott Phillips was the drummer for Creed and Alter Bridge. Members had other past connections as well. Creed had toured with Sevendust in the past, such as for Woodstock 99. Friedman had worked with members of Creed in the past; Phillips played drums for half the tracks on Submersed's first album, "In Due Time", while Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti produced the album and played on one track. Additionally, Friedman later contributed to Tremonti's 2012 solo project, and respective album, "All I Was".
Conolly, who spearheaded the project, said of making the album:
...we said we're just going to go in here and have fun with this. We had a bunch of songs lying around that we wanted to take in. Originally, it was just going to be me going in there and doing most everything. The more we talked about it and the more we got together a game plan and studio time, the more we kind of started talking about, "Hey, Scott, remember ten years ago when we first talked about doing that thing, that side project? Well, what are you doing in March?" Literally, it was pretty much that. Erock [Eric Friedman was like, "Hey, man I want to get in on this." I had already talked to Vinnie about doing it, because we knew that Sevendust members Morgan Rose and Clint Lowery were going to be doing Call Me No One. It literally came together, for lack of a better description and explanation for how it really happened. It wasn't like I sat down and said, here is my top fifty drummers that I'm going to go after, here's my top 25 guitar players — it wasn't that at all. It was just us saying, "Hey, man, let's just go in and do what we always said we were going to do." I think the end result at the end of the day surprised us just as much as it surprised everyone else.
Projected has completed work on their debut album, "Human", in early June 2012, and was released on September 18, 2012. Conolly has mentioned that while he does intend to have the band play live shows and tour, he's not sure when, due to all of the member's different obligations to different bands.
Musical style and influences.
Connolly has described the band's sound to something similar to the Foo Fighters and A Perfect Circle.

Also occasionally called the Breton Dwarf, it is one of the smallest breeds of sheep in the world. Rams are around tall at the shoulder, and the ewes about . They are currently being raised in a number of European countries including Germany, France, and Great Britain. In North America they are beginning to be bred in Massachusetts, and raised in California.
Most Ouessant are black or dark brown in color, but white individuals do occur. The rams have relatively large horns, and ewes are polled. The Ouessant existed exclusively on its home island until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still a rare breed today. Ewes rarely produce twins, and the breed is primarily used for wool production. In Paris, the city government recently began using a small herd of Ouessant sheep to graze public lands.

Anthologies.
In French, almost all of Foucault's shorter writings, published interviews and miscellany have been published in a collection called "Dits et écrits", originally published in four volumes in 1994, latterly in only two volumes.
In English, there are a number of overlapping anthologies, which often use conflicting translations of the overlapping pieces, frequently with different titles. Richard Lynch's bibliography of Foucault's shorter work is invaluable for keeping track of these multiple versions. The major collections in English are:
Lectures.
In a 1967 lecture, called in English either "Different spaces" or "Of Other Spaces" (reprinted in "Aesthetics, Method, and Epistemology", and in "The Visual Culture Reader", ed. Nicholas Mirzoeff), Foucault coined a novel concept of the heterotopia.

Tamera Alexander

Tamera Lynn Gattis Alexander (born 1961) is an American author of Christian fiction, who specializes in the inspirational romance genre. She is best known for her award-winning first series, the Fountain Creek Chronicles (2006–07).
Biography.
Early life and education.
Tamera Alexander grew up in Decatur, Georgia, the daughter of an insurance company executive and a bank manager. As a child, Alexander enjoyed writing poetry and short stories, but never dreamed of some day writing fiction as a career. She attended and would later graduate high school from Greater Atlanta Christian School in 1979. Early advisors led her to choose what was regarded as a more practical livelihood within the field of business—a discipline she began studying in 1979 while attending Harding University. She earned her Bachelor of Business Administration degree in management in 1983.
Career.
Upon graduation, she began her business career in Atlanta, Georgia, before accepting a position with Data Communications Corporation in Memphis, Tennessee in 1984 as an entry-level customer service representative. Within three years, she had advanced through the company ranks and was managing a staff of 27 employees and supporting corporate clients such as Turner Broadcasting Systems (TBS), with a heavy traveling schedule. The arrival of her first child in 1987 and a new employment opportunity for her husband, led to a family relocation to Abilene, Texas, also in 1987. A second child and another job opportunity for her husband resulted in another move in 1990, this time to Greeley, Colorado where she began to experience the landscape and history of the Rocky Mountains.
After her mother-in-law encouraged her to read a book by Janette Oke in 1994, Alexander subsequently began to read every work of Christian fiction she could find and penned her first manuscript in 2000, a historical piece set in the 1870s Colorado Territory and unofficially titled, "As High as the Heavens". The manuscript made it all the way to the final review board with Bethany House Publishers before being rejected in 2002. Rejections from another publisher would follow, and although at first discouraged, she quickly returned to the drawing board, determined to apply the planning and analytical skills she had learned in business to studying the craft of writing. She began dissecting numerous novels in an attempt to better understand the recipe for success in historical Christian fiction/romance. 
Her second completed manuscript, "Rekindled", was contracted by Bethany House in 2004 and published in March 2006, where it quickly climbed to #8 on the Christian Booksellers Association CBA national best-sellers list in May 2006. The book was in its tenth printing as of February 2010. 
Alexander's subsequent novels between 2006 and 2010 were each in the inspirational fiction genre and set in the Colorado Territory (circa latter 1800s) with the Rocky Mountains as a landscape backdrop. Her second novel, "Revealed", climbed to #18 on the CBA national best-sellers list in March 2008. "Remembered", the third novel in the Fountain Creek Chronicles series, recently went to a fifth printing (March 2009). 
Alexander's second three-book series, "Timber Ridge Reflections", was launched in May 2008 with the release of "From a Distance". The book debuted on the ECPA national fiction best-seller list at #20 in July 2008 and peaked on Amazon.com at #30 for all titles in August 2010. The second title in the series, "Beyond This Moment", was released in April 2009, and debuted at #10 on the ECPA May national fiction best-seller list and climbed to #7 in June. The title also debuted at #11 on the CBA national fiction best-sellers list for June 2009. It went to a second printing in June 2010.
In early 2008, Alexander was contracted by Thomas Nelson, Inc. to write the publisher's first historical romance novel for its "Women of Faith Fiction series." "The Inheritance" debuted at #1 as the top-selling Christian fiction romance title at Christian Book Distributors for March 2009 and also climbed to #15 and #11 on the CBA national best-sellers list for March and April 2009, respectively, appearing again at #19 in August 2009. The title also debuted at #17 on the ECPA national fiction best-seller list in April 2009. "The Inheritance" reappeared on the ECPA best-seller fiction list in January 2010 and the CBA best-seller fiction list in February 2010. 
Alexander's third installment in the Timber Ridge Reflections series (Within My Heart) released August 2010 and had already climbed to the #1 bestseller spot in Fiction Romance at Christian Book Distributors by month's end. In addition, Within My Heart then climbed as high as #10 on the ECPA national best-seller fiction list for October 2010 and was later acclaimed as a finalist in both the RITA Awards (Romance Writers of America) and Christy Awards for best in the historical romance category.
Her next two series, each scheduled for three-books, draw from Nashville's historic mansions as backdrops (1860s to 1870s post Civil War). The Belmont Mansion (Tennessee) series launched in late October 2011 with release of the first title (A Lasting Impression). The title debuted at #13 on the ECPA national fiction best-seller list, December 2011, and reappeared most recently at #19 on the CBA best-seller fiction list (August 2012). The Belle Meade Plantation series launched in November 2012, with release of the first title (To Whisper Her Name), which debuted as a USA Today best-seller and climbed as high as #5 on Amazon.com. The second installment in the Belmont series (A Beauty So Rare) is set for release in May 2014.
Marriage and children.
Tamera and Joe Alexander live in Brentwood, Tennessee. They have two children, currently in their 20s.

Reliquary Shrine of Saint Eleutherius

The great gilt-copper and enamel Reliquary Shrine of Saint Eleutherius in the cathedral of Tournai (Belgium), one of the masterpieces of Gothic metalwork, was commissioned by Bishop Walter de Marvis of Tournai, and completed in 1247, on the occasion of the retranslation of relics of Saint Eleutherius of Tournai, traditionally the city's first bishop. The shrine takes the architectural form of a "chasse" or gabled casket; its more distant prototype is the gabled sarcophagus that was an established Romanesque convention in Northern Europe, "a form which was quite fitting," Marvin Ross observed in discussing the similarly shaped gilt-copper and enamel reliquary of Saint Amand in the Walters Museum "since these châsses were in a sense also tombs". As with the prototypical tombs, a blind arcade runs along the base, forming niches with the protective seated figures of Apostles and Prophets. In its gable end St Eleutherius appears, holding his crozier in one hand and in the other a model of the cathedral with its five spires. 
The shrine was made in Tournai or its immediate vicinity, once part of a prolific production that is now all but lost; it has been attributed to the workshop that was founded by Nicholas of Verdun, the leading goldsmith of Mosan art, who completed the reliquary of Our Lady in 1205. It is conserved in the Treasury of the cathedral of Tournai, housed in the former chapterhouse.
Two years following the completion of this reliquary, a separate one was made for the head of Saint Eleutherius, now lost with its contents.

WUTS (91.3 FM) is a radio station licensed to Sewanee, Tennessee, USA. The station is owned by the University of the South. 
WUTS broadcasts a combination of alternative and classic rock, jazz, blues and classical music programming. The station is staffed entirely by student volunteers, and receives an annual allocation of operating funds from the University.
The first incarnation of student radio at Sewanee was as an unlicensed AM carrier current station in early 1972. Later in that year WUTS was officially licensed to broadcast with 10 watts on 88.1 FM. Its studios were located in the basement of Thompson Student Union. In 1974 WUTS moved into custom-built studios on the 2nd floor of a new student union, The Bishops’ Common, where it remains today.
In the mid 70s the FCC required WUTS to move its frequency to 91.5 FM, in order to not interfere with a new, higher-powered station in Chattanooga on the same FM channel.
In 1981, WUTS was granted a construction permit from the FCC to increase its power to 100 watts. With it came yet another frequency change, to 91.3 FM, where it remains today.
In 2011, WUTS increased its power to 300 watts, allowing the station to reach all of Sewanee and the surrounding communities.

Harish Raghavendra

Harish Raghavendra (born 7 January 1976) is an Indian vocalist and actor from Chennai, India. He is the son of photographer P.V Raghavendran. Harish is best known for his songs like "Hey Azhagiya Theeyee" from Minnale, "Nirpadhuve Nadapadhuve" from Barathi, "Devathayai Kanden" from Kadhal Kondein, "Sakkarai Nilave" from Youth, "Melliname Melliname" from Shahjahan and "Anbe Enn Anbe" from Dhaam Dhoom. He has also acted in a few Tamil Movies. He debuted as an actor in "Vikadan" directed by Arun Pandiyan in which he played the lead role. He also played a brother-role for Ajith Kumar in "Thirupathi", which was written and directed by Perarasu. 
Career.
Harish officially made his debut into the music industry as a singer at the age of 18. His first song was a Telugu song for the movie "Panjaram" and he subsequently sung 'Vaa Saghi' for the movie "Arasiyal" which starred mega-star Mammootty as the hero. He was in his first year of college at the time. After that, he was not really active in the music industry. In the mean time, he graduated from Vivekananda College with a Degree in Commerce and Masters in Mass Communication & Journalism. He took up Software Engineering as well. Software Engineering would have been his main career if not for music. Being a police officer was also one of his ambitions when he was studying.
He re-entered the music industry through the well known classical song "Nirpadhuve Nadapathuve" from the movie Barathi. The music was composed by Ilaiyaraja. The song became a massive hit back in the year 2000 & it brought him fame along with Tamil Nadu State award. This was the time he changed his name from Harish to Harish Raghavendra, per Ilaiyaraja's recommendation. Before he could even join the software industry, "Ye Azhagiye Theeye" from Minnale scored a roaring success back to back. Since then, he has sung over 4000 songs for more than 200 movies. He has worked for most of the well known music composers that include Yuvan Shankar Raja, Vidyasagar, D. Imman, Vijay Antony, Harris Jayaraj & many others. However Harish's "Mudhal Mazhaye" album did not pick up that well in the market. But his charming sharp voice has always been a point of attraction for many music directors, so he managed to sing in various languages such as Tamil (his main passion), Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam & Hindi. He has sung some devotional songs as well. After 'Panjaram', he sang for the Telugu film "Neetho' under Vidyasagar's baton. Since then he has sung many more songs in Telugu, including films like 'Cheli', 'Priyadarshini' and Ghajini.
Having sung many classic hits for the major music directors, Harish is considered to be one of the leading professional singers in Tamil Music Industry. He has also judged many reality shows along with few other famous singers. Harish has also done a number of live concerts in various countries as well. Lately, he also grabbed a Diploma in Yoga in Krishnamacharya style.
His words about Ilayaraja, "Illaiyaraja is a hard taskmaster and a perfectionist. It's really tough singing for him, because he does not let go till he gets the result he wants. It's like a training ground for any singer, and singing for him".

The Fosters (1976 TV series)

The Fosters is a British television programme, produced by London Weekend Television which aired on ITV from 9 April 1976, until 9 July 1977.
It was created and developed by Jon Watkins, who adapted the American sitcom, "Good Times", developed by Norman Lear, and created by Eric Monte and Mike Evans. It was the first British sitcom to have an entirely black cast. It was the predecessor to many future British television programmes that featured a predominantly black cast: ("No Problem!", "Desmond's", "The Lenny Henry Show").
Overview.
The series starred Norman Beaton as Samuel Foster, a hard-working man trying to support his family in a South London multi-storey council flat. The Samuel character was based on the fictional character James Evans Sr. in "Good Times". Alongside Beaton, was Canadian actress Isabelle Lucas, portraying Samuel's wife, Pearl Foster (Florida Evans in the original), who gossips with her best friend, Vilma, played by Carmen Munroe. Vilma was originally the character Willona Woods, who in the American version, gossips with Florida on every one inside (and outside) the housing projects, much to James' dismay. Munroe and Beaton would later star in "Desmond's" as married couple Shirley and Desmond Ambrose.
Including in the show's cast was future comedian Lenny Henry, in his first regular series, playing Sonny Foster, Pearl and Samuel's oldest child and son, a painter. J.J. Evans was the American equivalent.
Sharon Rosita played Sonny's younger sister, Shirley Foster (in the US: Thelma Evans), the only daughter in the family, and the second oldest. Samuel and Pearl's younger son, Benjamin, was played by Lawrie Mark. In the American series, Michael Evans was Benjamin's double.
The series' episodes (and titles) were derived from scripts from the original "Good Times" episodes. The series produced 27 episodes and two series, ending its year-long run on 9 July 1977.

Saint Saviour's Chapel at Harvard-Westlake School in the Studio City section of Los Angeles, California, is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (No. #32). The chapel was patterned after the Chapel at Rugby School in England. Its pews face the center aisle, and it is considered an excellent example of the collegiate chapel style. It also features a large rood cross made by students in the school's wood shop. The chapel was built in 1914 at the original campus of the Harvard School at Western Avenue and Venice Boulevard. It was designed by Reginald Johnson, the son of the first Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles.

Davik Church

Davik Church () is a parish church in Bremanger Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It is located in the village of Davik. The church is part of the Davik parish in the Nordfjord deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The church, with a seating capacity of 500, is a wooden "long church". It was consecrated on 6 July 1886 by the Bishop Fredrik Waldemar Hvoslef. The architect Georg Andreas Bull made the designs. The church was built near the site of a previous cruciform church which had become too small for the congregation. There was some controversy as to where the new (present) church was to be built. Many wanted the church to be built on the other side of the Nordfjorden, but the people on the south side protested, and it was finally decided to build the new church near the old church.
Building.
The church itself is not particularly long, but it is unusually wide. Before the pipe organ was installed in the gallery in 1933, the church could seat 700 people. Davik Church is thus one of the biggest in the county. The chancel and the nave are partitioned only by a low balustrade, and have the same width as the porch. The square chancel has permanent benches along the side walls. The pew seats are painted blue, and otherwise oak-coloured with individual numbers for the various farms and families. The slanted ceiling in the nave and chancel are painted white, but towards the side walls of the nave, the ceiling is lowered and flat. The church room has columns supporting the gallery as well as functioning as roof supports to the sides. Along the walls there are five pointed-arch windows on either side, with green and red top sections. The altar rail is oval with a white-painted balustrade, similar to the low chancel partition. The usual vestries are located behind the chancel. On the western wall is the spacious porch with stairways on either side leading up to the gallery. In the corners of the porch there are small rooms with toilet facilities.
The steeple is placed on the roof ridge itself. The turret base is square, the steeple is octagonal and the spire is covered with copper. The impression of an unusually big and fine church is strengthened precisely because of its wide west wall and the pure, elegant lines in the architecture.

WFC encourages people of all ages and backgrounds to get out on the waters of Oyster Bay and learn about the marine environment and the sport of sailing. WFC provides marine education programs, sailing instruction to adults and children, Junior Summer Programs, school field trips, scout activities, cruises on its historic oyster sloop Christeen, and kayak and sailboat rentals.
The Christeen.
The Christeen is the oldest oyster sloop in the United States and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992. She was built in 1883 in Glenwood Landing, New York as a gaff-rigged sloop. She had several homes including Essex, Connecticut, but in 1992 she arrived back in the hamlet of Oyster Bay, New York at The WaterFront Center. Funds were raised and over the next seven years, she was restored and relaunched. She currently serves as a working museum ship, offering educational tours of Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor.
History.
Oyster Bay is said to have some of the healthiest waters in the Long Island Sound; they are classified SA - signifying the highest and best water quality. Home of the famous “Pine Island” oysters, farmed since l887 by Frank M. Flower and Sons, our waters produce up to 90 percent of the oysters and up to 40 percent of the hard clams harvested in all of New York State.
This area of the waterfront used to be the site of Jakobson’s Shipyard, which during World War II employed over 600 workers, building minesweepers, tugboats and mini-submarines for the U.S. Navy. At its height of production, Jakobson’s Shipyard was the largest builder of tugboats east of the Mississippi.
Today this is the home of The WaterFront Center, an environmental education facility, and the Oyster Bay Sailing School. Here visitors can go aboard the Christeen, the oldest remaining oyster sloop in North America.

Similar to Port, Moscatel de Setúbal are wood aged until they are bottled. They can be made from grapes of a single vintage or in a "non-vintage" style as a blend of several vintages. The wines tend to be at their freshest and more fruit styles up to around 5–6 years of age where they have pronounced apricot notes. As they age, the wines get darker with more raisin, caramel and nutty aromas and flavors.
Grapes.
The DOC regulations for Moscatel de Setúbal specify that the wines are to be composed primarily of Muscat of Alexandria or Moscatel Roxo. The blend can include up to 30% of Arinto, Boais, Diagalves, Fernao Pires, Malvasia, Olho de Lebre, Rabo de Ovelha, Roupeiro, Talia, Tamarez and Vital.

Supreme Court of Cocos (Keeling) Island

The Supreme Court of Cocos (Keeling) Island is one of the highest courts for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, a territory of Australia. The court was originally established in 1958 after the British Government transferred sovereignty for the island from Singapore to Australia. The court had jurisdiction to deal with all serious crimes and major civil claims for damages occurring on the Island.
Judges from Australian courts were appointed to be judges of the court. Those judges would travel to the island to hear, consider and determine cases. In 1992 courts in Western Australia were given concurrent authority to deal with cases on the Island, and those courts have now become the only venue in which litigation is conducted. The Court does not now actually decide cases, as the court will be abolished once the last appointed judge retires.
Background to establishment of court.
The Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Island consists of approximately 27 coral islands located in the Indian Ocean about 2700 kilometres north-west of Perth, Western Australia. William Keeling discovered the uninhabited Islands in 1609. Alexander Hare first settled them in 1820 with people of Malay origin. In 1827 John Clunies-Ross settled on the Island to harvest coconuts. The Islands are named after the coconut “Cocos Nucifera”. 
The British Government annexed the Islands in 1857. The Islands became a territory of Australia on 23 November 1955 after having been administered as a dependency of the British Crown Colony of Singapore. As a result of the transfer in 1955, all laws in force before the transfer were to continue except as amended or repealed by Ordinance. The laws inherited have been described as “a complex legal legacy”. They include United Kingdom law, Straits Settlements laws, and Singapore laws. Punishments, such as whipping and beating, were still available as options for dealing with criminal offences.
Establishment of the court.
The court is established by section 4 of the Supreme Court Ordinance 1955 as the Supreme Court of Cocos. The court has jurisdiction under the Singapore Courts Ordinance. This Ordinance gives it all the jurisdiction which the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory had in 1955. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory is in turn based on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales that existed on 1 January 1911. The court also had jurisdiction when an applied Singaporean law said that either the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements (including the High Court of that court or the Court of Appeal of that court), the Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore (including the High Court, or the Court of Appeal of that Court, or the Court of Criminal Appeal of either the Straits Settlements or of the Colony of Singapore.
The Supreme Court Rules as they existed in the Australian Capital Territory before 23 November 1955 governed the procedure of the Court. This was the date on which the court was established. All cases were to be heard by a single judge without a jury. The Court was to sit principally on the West Island but it could sit anywhere having regard to the interests of justice. The Administrator of the Island is the registrar of the Court. The Administrator is appointed by the Governor-General.
One of the difficulties for the Islanders was that there were no resident lawyers on the Island. Coupled with the time difference, it was hard to get timely advice on the legal matters in the territory.
Notable cases.
In Clunies-Ross v Totterdell, Justice French of the Federal Court of Australia held that the Bankruptcy Ordinance 1888 of the former Colony of Singapore continued to apply to the Island. As a consequence, the court could assist Singaporean courts in bankruptcy proceedings as the court still had a bankruptcy jurisdiction based on that old law. French also held that the Bankruptcy Act 1914 (UK) continued to apply to the court. As a result, bankruptcy on the Island could be dealt with under that English law. It was accepted that Australian bankruptcy laws did not apply to the Island and a letter of request was necessary to be issued for Australian laws to apply.
In giving his judgment on the then state of the law, French said that the laws of the territory can be regarded as “regulated by a system of law which is Byzantine in its complexity”.
Reform.
The Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs conducted an inquiry into the state of laws in the Island, as well as other Territories under Australian control. In March 1991 it tabled its findings on those legal systems in what is known as the “Islands in the Sun” report. In respect of the Island, it concluded that the laws were a “national disgrace” and probably breached United Nations standards. The committee recommended that the laws that applied in Western Australia replace the existing legal regime.
Abolition of the court.
In 1992 the Australian Parliament passed laws which put into effect the recommendations of the committee. One of the consequences of this change was that courts in Western Australia have undertaken the work of the court under a service delivery arrangement with the Commonwealth Government. The Western Australian Magistrates Court, District Court, Supreme Court, Family Court, Children's Court and Coroner's Court all provide services to the Island as required. As a result, the utility for a separate superior court in the territory was no longer necessary. 
Those legal changes provide that the Governor-General may abolish the court by way of proclamation on a future date once the last judge of the court retires.

The Birth of the Clinic

The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception () is a 1963 book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. First published in French in 1963, the work was published in English translation in 1973. Developing the themes explored in his previous work, "Madness and Civilization", Foucault traces the development of the medical profession, and specifically the institution of the "clinique" (translated as "clinic", but here largely referring to teaching hospitals). Its central points are the concept of the medical "regard" ("medical gaze") and the sudden re-organisation of knowledge at the end of the 18th century, which would be expanded in his next major work, "The Order of Things".
The medical gaze.
Foucault coined the term "medical gaze" to denote the dehumanizing medical separation of the patient's body from the patient's person (identity); (see mind-body dualism). He uses the term in a genealogy describing the creation of a field of knowledge of the body. The material and intellectual structures that made possible the analysis of the body were mixed with power interests: in entering the field of knowledge, the human body also entered the field of power, becoming a possible target for manipulation. Originally, the "medical gaze" was confined to post-modern and post-structuralist academic use, but now frequently is used in graduate medical and social work courses.
The French and American revolutions that spawned modernity also created a "meta-narrative" of scientific discourse that held scientists, specifically medical doctors, as sages who would in time abolish sickness and so solve all of humanity's problems. For the nineteenth-century moderns, medical doctors replaced the discredited medieval clergy; physicians save bodies, not souls. This myth was part of the greater discourse of the humanist and Enlightenment schools of thought that believed the human body to be the sum of a person: biological reductionism that became a powerful tool of the new sages: Through thorough examination (gazing) of a body, a doctor deduces symptom, illness, and cause, therefore achieving unparalleled understanding of the patient — hence, the doctor's "medical gaze" was believed to penetrate surface illusions, in near-mystical discovery of hidden truth.
The epistemic change.
Foucault's understanding of the development of the "clinique" is primarily opposed to those histories of medicine and the body that consider the late 18th century to be the dawning of a new "supposed" empirical system, "based on the rediscovery of the absolute values of the visible." In Foucault's view, the birth of modern medicine was not a commonsensical movement towards simply seeing what was already there (and therefore a science without a philosophy), but rather a decisive shift in the structure of knowledge. That is to say, modern medicine is not a mere progression from the late 18th century wherein an understanding of the true nature of the body and disease is gradually acquired. Foucault recommends a view of the history of medicine, and clinical medicine in particular, as an epistemological rupture, rather than result of a number of great individuals discovering new ways of seeing and knowing the truth:
The clinic - constantly praised for its empiricism, the modesty of its attention, and the care with which it silently lets things surface to the observing gaze without disturbing them with discourse - owes its real importance to the fact that it is a reorganization in depth, not only of medical discourse, but of the very possibility of a discourse about disease.
Thus the empiricism of the 18th and 19th centuries is not a naive or naked act of looking and noting down what is before the doctor's eyes. The relationship between subject and object is not just the one who knows and the one who tells; the contact between the doctor and their individual patient does not pre-exist discourse as "mindless phenomenologies" would suggest. Rather, the clinical science of medicine came to exist as part of a wider structure of organising knowledge that allowed the articulation of medicine as a discipline, making possible "the domain of its experience and the structure of its rationality". In other words, the observations and analysis of an object (for instance a diseased organ) depended entirely upon the accepted practices as outlined in the contemporary organisation of knowledge. Investigation, diagnosis and treatment all followed that contemporary organisation, in which case the criteria that distinguishes a diseased organ from a healthy one is thoroughly historical.
Foucault would later formalise this notion in the episteme, where one epistemological era gives way to another, thus allowing one concept of what is scientific to move aside for another. In this case, as outlined in "The Order of Things", the taxonomic era gave way to the organic historical era; thus, the clinic was not simply founded upon the observation of truth, and therefore more correct than any preceding medicinal practice, but rather an artefact of a theory of knowledge inserted within a specific discursive period. The authority of the clinician relies on a relationship to the then current organisation of knowledge, instead of a relationship to a non-discursive state of affairs ('reality'). Because of this, an early 18th-century doctor could observe an organ with exactly the same disease as a 19th-century doctor, with both doctors coming to vastly different conclusions about what caused the disease and how to treat it. Despite this difference, both accounts would be 'true', since they were both spoken in an episteme that considered such statements to be true.
This means that anatomists like Morgagni and Bichat were not students of the same discipline, even though their work was only thirty years apart. The epistemic change meant that the bodies, diseases, tissues and pathologies that each cut open and explored were articulated in completely different and discontinuous discourses from one another. Thus anatomy's claim to be a privileged empirical science that can observe and determine a true bodily schema cannot stand when its beginnings were not in a discovery of a way of coming to know what was real, but rather emerged amongst a new philosophical way of granting meaning and organising certain objects. Hence the use of "birth" in the title; the clinic had no origins, but simply and suddenly arrived.

Besides being an obvious play on testes – including the descended double "e" in its logo – the show's title plays up the vulnerability of test subjects, which is the source of much of the humour in the series.
DVD releases.
Paradox Entertainment released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 (Canada only) on February 22, 2011.
On April 26, 2011, Entertainment One released the entire series on DVD in the US.

Marquette Park (Gary)

Marquette Park, originally called "Lake Front Park", is a municipal park completely surrounded by the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Its primary elements include 1.4 miles (2.2 km) of white sand Lake Michigan beaches, inland ponds, impressively high sand dunes, wetlands, a lagoon and indigenous oak savanna. The Park is located within the Miller Beach community. Miller Beach was once an independent municipality. However, in 1918 shortly before the establishment of Marquette Park, the Town Of Miller was forcibly annexed into the municipal boundaries of Gary, Indiana . The Park includes the Octave Chanute museum, registered as a National Landmark of Soaring.
History.
Dunes waterfront.
The area now making up Marquette Park has a storied past. Before white settlement the area was populated by Miami Indians. The entire southernmost edge of Lake Michigan (including Miller Beach) had sandy soil unsuitable for raising crops. However, the land was teeming with wildlife and fish, making the area popular for hunting, trapping and gathering berries. The Miami Indians were driven from the area during the Iroquois Wars of the second half of the 17th century. The Potawatomi Indians then moved into the Miller Beach region from the north. 
The famous explorer Father "Pere" Marquette passed through Miller Beach while returning from his second exploration of the water passage from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. In 1673 he and Louis Joliet had ventured through Wisconsin and down the Mississippi, returning to Sault Ste Marie via the Illinois and Chicago Rivers. The next year Marquette ventured down Lake Michigan to the Chicago River and the portage to the Illinois, entering the Mississippi in the spring of 1675. Marquette was sick, however, and returning that spring he passed along the shores of Miller Beach close to death. He died only days later at the mouth of the Pere Marquette River in Michigan.
Before the creation of the Marquette Park Lagoon, this future park location was the site of the mouth of the Grand Calumet River. Joseph Bailly, an early settler in the region, laid out a town to be developed at this location. Dubbed "Indiana City", it remained on the maps for many years, but never had more than a few shacks on it. During the Antebellum period the area that was to become the town of Miller became an essential part of the Underground Railroad. The Miller dunes and swamp areas, now part of Marquette Park, served as a haven for runaway slaves.
Development of park.
Until 1874, the parcel of sandy land that is now Marquette Park was a relatively anonymous patch of dunes waterfront at what was then the mouth of the Grand Calumet River. In 1874, it became part of the sand dunes homestead of 19th-century settlers Robert and Druisilla Carr. During the Carr period, the dunes became the site of key hang gliding experiments carried out in 1896-1897 by a team led by pioneering aeronaut Octave Chanute. 
Although the land had been in the possession of the Carr family for years, in 1919 United States Steel Corporation illegally claimed ownership of the land and gave it to the City of Gary for a park This illegal land seizure was a focal point in the controversy surrounding the forced annexation of the town of Miller by the city of Gary. When this area was first dedicated to public use it was originally named "Lake Front Park"; however the park was soon renamed in honor of Father Marquette. An imposing statue of the explorer/missionary stands at the gateway to the park. 
During the prosperous 1920s, the city of Gary invested a significant sum in landscaping the park. The "Marquette Park Pavilion" was built adjacent to the beachfront, and most of a wetland area behind the beach, formerly part of the Grand Calumet River, was excavated to form the "Marquette Lagoon". Two Japanese-inspired bridges span the lagoon today.
Historic structures.
Aquatorium.
What is now known as the Gary Bathing Beach Aquatorium was designed by the firm of Maher and Sons (George W. Maher, architect) and was built as a shower/bathroom/changing facility in 1921. It was dubbed the Lakefront Park Bathhouse. A major focal point of the Miller Beach community for decades, by the 1960s the facility was falling into major disrepair. In 1971 the building was closed to the public and boarded up. The Aquatorium was rescued from demolition by the Chanute Aquatorium Society in 1991.
The Society invented the word Aquatorium meaning "place to view the water" in order to disassociate the structure with the word bathhouse.
No longer a place to change or shower, the building now serves as a museum honoring Octave Chanute, the father of flight. Chanute conducted some of the first heavier-than-air glider flights in human history in the high dunes just yards from the structure. His successful experiments and glider designs paved the way for the Wright brothers' powered flight at Kitty Hawk. The building also honors the Tuskegee Airmen, aeronautic pioneers who spearheaded the integration of the armed forces. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised for the building's restoration and revamping. 
The building is also architecturally significant. It is one of the earliest examples of pre-cast concrete modular construction. Ninety percent of the building is built with only six basic cast blocks, the most basic being the T-Block, a precursor of today's standard concrete block. 
Lee Construction Management of Miller was employed to begin restoration of the facility. In the spring of 1998, they demolished the east showers and began construction of new wing in January 1999. In the spring of 2000, major reconstruction of the second floor waterproofed the first floor areas so museum space could be constructed below. The cornerstone for The Tuskegee Airmen Wing of the new museum was laid January 17, 1999.
Marquette Park Pavilion.
The "Recreation Pavilion" was built in 1923-24 by Maximillian Dubois' construction company Max and Sons, which also built the Palace Theater in Gary, Indiana. It was also designed by Maher and Sons (George W. Maher, architect), and located on the south side of the lagoon in the Grand Calumet River. The building cost $350,000. Renovated in 1966, and again around 2008, the building is still a popular site for all sorts of events, from weddings to civic functions.

Day of Niagara

Inside the Dream Syndicate, Vol. I: Day of Niagara or simply Day of Niagara is a 1965 album by the minimalist music group the Theatre of Eternal Music, aka The Dream Syndicate. Contributors include future Velvet Underground bassist John Cale, original Velvet Underground drummer Angus Maclise, composers La Monte Young and Tony Conrad, and Marian Zazeela.
Overview.
Consisting of a single half-hour track, Day of Niagara catches a glimpse of The Dream Syndicate in the prime of their short-lived but intriguing collaborative tenure. Recorded and forgotten, it was not released until several years later as a bootleg recording. La Monte Young threatened legal action on the release, as there had been no written agreement on who actually owned the rights to the music.
As it was released as a bootleg tape, the recording quality noticeably suffers.

Simphiwe Dana

Simphiwe Dana is a Xhosa Singer and song-writer in South Africa.
With her unique combination of Jazz, Afro-soul, RAP and Traditional music, she has been hailed as the "new Miriam Makeba".
Early life.
Simphiwe was born in 1980 in Gcuwa, Transkei, in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.
Her father was a preacher and as she grew up she heard church music in both choral and gospel forms.
Education Background.
She schooled at the Vela Private School in Mthatha, where she matriculated in 1997.
Her tertiary education pursued her interests in graphic design, and she successfully studied for her National Diploma in IT at the Wits Technikon, Johannesburg.
Career.
From 2002, she sang in small clubs in Johannesburg where she began attracting attention.
She made a major impact in South Africa with the release in 2004 of Zandisile. The album sold very well and gained several awards, including some South African Music Award (SAMA) in 2005. On its worldwide release the album gained success in the Billboard charts and she won an AVO Session Basel Award.
Dana, who has been likened to singers such as Miriam Makeba and Dorothy Masuka, sings an artful musical form that blends traditional African music with contemporary soul and hence shows hints of gospel and blues. The depth of her musical portrayals is such that she has drawn approval from an older generation of South Africans, especially women, while her youth and grasp of contemporary pop has endeared her to the young audience. Among the songs in Dana’s repertoire are ‘Ndiredi’, ‘Troubled Soldier’, ‘Chula Ukunyathela’, ‘Bantu Biko Street’, ‘Zundiqondisise’, ‘Uzobuya Nini’, ‘Sonini Nanini’ and ‘Naphakade’. She also sings the theme song of the Yizo Yizo television show.
She has maintained a strong presence, with consistent radio play and live appearances at key national events and Festivals such as Arts Alive, the Cape Town International Jazz Festival and the Standard Bank Joy of Jazz.
With two commercially-successful and critically acclaimed albums to her credit, she maintains a busy live performance roster, which increasingly includes international dates.
Her third album, Kulture Noir, was released in the summer of 2010. She later released her live album, An Evening with Sipmhiwe Dana Live in Concert, which features her singing some of her best hits accompanied by a 27 piece orchestra. Simphiwe has been vocal on topical issues in social media including political issues in South Africa.
Simphiwe Dana is also active in the World Music scene in Europe.
Inspiration.
Dana’s music draws strongly on her upbringing in the Transkei, and she sites the powerful singing of her mother as an inspiration for her and her siblings, and ultimately as a key motivator in her resolve to pursue her musical career.
Awards.
In 2005, Simphiwe Dana won the "Best Newcomer" award and Best Jazz Vocal album at the 11th South African Music Awards with her first album "Zandisile".
Two years later, she was named the "Best Female Artist", with the song "The One Love Movement on Bantu Biko Street", at the 13th South African Music Awards.
Tragedies.
In September 2005, travelling to perform in Vereeniging, she was involved in a serious road accident, she was pregnant at the time. She was hospitalised for a week and needed reconstructive surgery, but fortunately gave birth to a healthy baby boy. In the ensuing period, she took time out to prioritise her maternal role and also for her own healing.

The Confederación Antillana or Antillean Confederation was the vehement idea of Ramón Emeterio Betances about the need for natives of the Spanish Caribbean to unite into a regional entity that would seek to preserve the sovereignty and well-being of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
Its main idea was to subsequently end European colonialism in the Americas as well as a response to the Monroe doctrine phrase "America for the Americans", which Ramón Emeterio Betances changed into " Antilles for the Antilleans". The main gathering point of the idealists was San Felipe de Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.

Donna Hilbert

Donna Hilbert (born June 25, 1946) is an American poet who also writes short stories, plays, and essays. As a founding member of the Progressive Dinner Party in Long Beach, California, she is also known for her commitment to social justice, philanthropy and community arts programs.
Life.
Hilbert was born in 1946 in Grandfield, Oklahoma, a small town near the Texas border south of Deep Red Creek and north of the Red River. Her family was Methodist. At the age of seven, she moved with her parents to the San Fernando Valley of Southern California, first in Van Nuys, then Reseda, and finally in Northridge. At the age of eighteen, she married into an upper middle class Catholic family. Hilbert and her husband raised three sons. In summer 1998 her husband was killed in a freak bicycle accident by a motorist driving home from a methadone clinic. She has lived in Long Beach, CA since 1998.
Career.
Hilbert did not begin writing until after her father's death, when she was 34 years old. By that time, she had thoroughly committed herself to the domestic heavy-lifting of many women in her generation, putting obligations as wife and mother before her own education or career. But Hilbert had long fostered an emerging ambition on her own by studying such diverse writers as Albert Camus, Sigmund Freud, Graham Greene, Omar Kayam, and Grace Metalious. She eventually completed an undergraduate degree, in political science, from California State University, Long Beach (in 1978), as well as a graduate degree, in psychotherapy, from the California Family Study Center (in 1987). 
In 1980, Hilbert began publishing poems in literary journals, and an editor at Event Horizon Press noticed her work, launching her debut collection, "Mansions", in 1990. Her subsequent books include a fiction collection, "Women Who Make Money and the Men Who Love Them" (1994), which won the Staple First Editions prize in England, and five other books of poetry:" Deep Red" (1993), "Feathers and Dust" (1996), "Transforming Matter" (2000), "Greatest Hits" (2001), and "Traveler in Paradise: New and Selected Poems" (2004). Hilbert’s writing is not easily slotted into a single tradition; she experiments with free-verse lyricism, formalism, and prose poetry. In more recent work, one can find elements of sardonic allegory, even surrealism. World Parade Books will publish her latest collection, titled "The Green Season," in 2009.
Long Beach poet and fiction writer Gerald Locklin authored "Two Novellas" in collaboration with Hilbert and has since shared the lectern with her many times at readings in the U.S. and United Kingdom. He describes Hilbert’s writing as “musical,” “imagistic,” and “much more poetic than most contemporary poetry without lapsing into the ‘pseudo-poetic’ or trite.” He also stresses that the trajectory of Hilbert’s career outside the traditional academy has been an unquestionable asset to her development as a writer: “She probably has more in common with the unselfconscious women writers of earlier generations than the more professionally or commercially driven women of our MFA generation.”
In the past three years, Hilbert has experimented in other genres, including nonfiction, playwriting, and the novel. For PEN USA, she continues to teach workshops for emerging writers.
Most recently, Hilbert's life and work since the tragic loss of her husband have become the subjects of an independent biopic, "Grief Becomes Me: A Poet's Journey," produced and directed by award-winning filmmaker Christine Fugate. The first installment of the film premiered at the annual Kentucky Women Writers Conference in 2004.

<doc id="19513419" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19513419" title="Midtgulen Church">
Midtgulen Church

Midtgulen Church () is a parish church in Bremanger Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It is located in the village of Midtgulen, along the shore of the Gulen fjord. The church is part of the Midtgulen parish in the Nordfjord deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The church, with a seating capacity of 200, was consecrated on 3 May 1904, by the Bishop Johan Willoch Erichsen. The architect Lars Sølvberg from Utvik made the designs. It is a wooden church of the "long church" design.
History.
The old municipality of Bremanger comprised some areas around the Gulen fjord, while the majority of people lived on the island of Bremangerlandet where the parish church was located. The local people of Midtgulen promoted the church issue more in the form of a wish rather than a demand, and they discussed the matter more among themselves than with the vicar.
The first vicar in the parish, Ulrik Koren, was not particularly enthusiastic about building a church at Mudtgulen, as this would imply crossing the Frøysjøen strait in all kinds of weather. The vicar on his part took no initiative to build more churches in the parish. A new church was built on the island of Frøya in the 1860s, moving the parish church to a more central location.
When the people of Gulen got an auxiliary graveyard in 1879, this was a step closer to getting their own church. In the early 1890s, the matter was formally put on the agenda for the local council. There was no discussion whatsoever concerning the location of the new church; it had to be next to the graveyard.
The people of Gulen got a fine and suitable church site close to the pine forest in the sheltered bay of Hjellvika. Various organisations and individuals joined forces to work and give gifts as the church was being built. The Gulen Rifle Club paid for the coloured window panes used in the church until the restoration work in 1954. The local youth organisation donated money for the first organ, and the congregation raised money for the baptismal font, and other objects and furniture.

Winnipeg had jumped out to a 9 to 0 lead but found the game tied in the last minute. Blue Bomber's all-star Bob Sandberg, who had scored his team's only touchdown, tried to fake a kick, but the ruse didn't work. Argo's star Joe Krol scored a final rouge to snatch the victory.

<doc id="19513468" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19513468" title="Nembrotha lineolata">
Nembrotha lineolata

Nembrotha lineolata is a species of nudibranch, a sea slug, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Polyceridae. It is found in shallow water in the Indo-Pacific. It was first described in 1905 by the Danish malacologist Rudolph Bergh. The type locality is Selayar Island, Indonesia.
Description.
"Nembrotha lineolata" grows to a length of about . The body is slender with a rounded head at one end and a pointed tip to the foot at the other. The exterior of the body is covered with longitudinal wrinkles and there is no sharp demarcation between the dorsal surface and the lateral surfaces. The oral tentacles are thick and long and the large conical rhinophores bear about thirty lamellae and can be retracted. The three large pinnate branchial plumes on the dorsal surface are non-retractile and the anus is located between them. The colouring of this nudibranch is variable across the animal's range. The body colour is creamy-white with narrow longitudinal lines, some broken, in varying shades of brown. Sometimes these lines merge in places giving transverse bands of colour. There is a blue or purple stripe running round the margin of the foot and often a yellow one as well. The oral tentacles are blue or purple with a yellow band and the rhinophores are red (sometimes yellow in the Comoros Islands) with blue or purple sheaths.
Distribution.
This is a widespread Indo-Pacific species occurring from the East African coast to Australia, Fiji and the Solomon Islands. Its range includes Bali, Fiji, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Japan, Kerama Islands, Ryukyu Islands, the Philippines, Australia, the Indian Ocean, the Seychelles, Tanzania and the Comoros Islands.
Biology.
"Nembrotha lineolata" has been observed feeding on tunicates such as "Oxycorynia fascicularis", "Clavelina" spp. and "Rhopalaea" spp.. It can insert its extensible oral tube through the tunicate's siphon and suck out the soft interior.
It lays its eggs in a yellowish-brown spiral ribbon and it is likely that the larvae that hatch out of these are free-swimming veliger larvae and form part of the plankton. Known predators of nudibranchs include fish, crabs, sea spiders and polychaete worms. There have been two instances when a sea anemone in the Edwardsiidae family has been observed attempting to feed on nudibranchs. In one attack on "Nembrotha lineolata", the sea slug flinched whenever it was touched by a tentacle but oozed a great deal of mucus and managed to struggle out of reach. It is unclear whether sea anemones normally prey on sea slugs or whether these are unusual occurrences.

Being Communists

Being Communists ("Essere Comunisti") is a faction within the Communist Refoundation Party in Italy, formed basically of former followers of Armando Cossutta, who left the party in 1998 to form the Party of Italian Communists. The leader of the group is Claudio Grassi.
The faction can be considered the "traditionalist" wing of the party, in the sense that it does not agree with what it considers an execessive criticism of real socialism, the Soviet Union and the Italian Communist Party. As proud communists, the group members are not generally keen on the party's participation to the European Left. In 2005 the group obtained the 26.5% of the delegates to the VI national congress of the party, while two years later it suffered the split of some hard-liners led by Fosco Giannini, who set up The Ernesto.
In April 2008, following the severe defeat of the party in the 2008 general election, a group of former "Bertinottiani", composed basically of former members of Proletarian Democracy and led by Paolo Ferrero and Giovanni Russo Spena, criticized the recent experiment of The Left – The Rainbow alliance and the political line of Fausto Bertinotti. Soon after this group, named Refoundation in Movement, formed an alliance with Being Communists in order to overthrow the leadership of the party. In the 24-27 July 2008 congress the motion supported by the two groups obtained 40.1% of the delegates and Paolo Ferrero was elected party secretary with the support of other minority factions.

2008 Waterford Senior Football Championship

The 2008 Waterford Senior Football Championship is the championship of the Waterford Senior Football Championship, the premier gaelic football competition in County Waterford, having commenced on 11 May 2008. There were 13 teams in the championship, structured into 2 groups of four teams and 1 group of 5 teams. From these groups, quarter finals, and semi-finals were played with a county final played in Fraher Field. Ballinacourty were the defending champions having beaten Ardmore in the 2007 final.
Championship Structure.
13 teams are competing in the 2008 championship. The 13 teams are split into 3 groups, 2 of which contain 4 teams and 1 which contains 5 teams. The top 2 teams in each of the 3 groups automatically progress into the quarter-finals. The 3rd placed teams in all groups qualify for a Round of 16 game, with two winners gaining entry into the quarter-final.
Teams on equal points in each group are ranked by highest points difference (points scored less points conceded). However, no team may be eliminated from the championship who finish on equal points. For this reason, playoffs are needed in both Group A and Group C to decide who finishes 3rd in this group and to decide who moves on in the championship.

Controversy over the discovery of Haumea

However, Brown suspects the Spanish team of fraud, of using Caltech observations to make their discovery, while the Ortiz team accuses the American team of political interference with the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU officially recognized the Californian team's proposed name "Haumea" in September 2008, although the Spanish team had proposed the name "Ataecina".
Discovery and announcement.
On December 28, 2004, Mike Brown and his team discovered Haumea on images they had taken with the 1.3 m SMARTS Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in the United States on May 6, 2004, while looking for what he hoped would be the tenth planet. The Caltech discovery team used the nickname "Santa" among themselves, as they had discovered Haumea on December 28, 2004, just after Christmas. However, it was clearly too small to be a planet as it was significantly smaller than Pluto, and Brown did not announce the discovery. Instead he kept it under wraps, along with several other large trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), until through additional observation he could better determine their natures. When his team discovered Haumea's moons, they realized that Haumea was more rocky than other TNOs, and that its moons were mostly ice. They then discovered a small family of nearby icy TNOs, and concluded that these were remnants of Haumea's icy mantle, which had been blasted off by a collision. On July 7, 2005, while he was finishing the paper describing the discovery, Brown's daughter Lilah was born, which delayed the announcement further. On July 20, the Caltech team published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery at a conference the following September. In this Haumea was given the code K40506A.
At around that time, Pablo Santos Sanz, a student of José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in southern Spain, examined the backlog of photos that the Ortiz team had started taking in December 2002. He says that he found Haumea in late July on images taken on March 7, 9, and 10, 2003. In checking whether this was a known object, the team came across Brown's internet summary, describing a bright TNO much like the one they had just found. Googling the reference number K40506A on the morning of July 26, they found the Caltech observation logs of Haumea, but according to their account, those logs contained too little information for Ortiz to tell if they were the same object. 
The Ortiz team also checked with the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which had no record of this object. Wanting to establish priority, they emailed the MPC with their discovery on the night of July 27, 2005, titled "Big TNO discovery, urgent", without making any mention of the Caltech logs. The next morning they again accessed the Caltech logs, including observations from several additional nights. They then asked Reiner Stoss at the amateur Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca for further observations. Stoss found precovery images of Haumea in digitized Palomar Observatory slides from 1955, and located Haumea with his own telescope that night, July 28. Within an hour, the Ortiz team submitted a second report to the MPC that included this new data. Again, no mention was made of having accessed the Caltech logs. The data was published by the MPC on July 29.
In a press release on the same day, the Ortiz team called Haumea the "tenth planet". On July 29, 2005, Haumea was given its first official label, the temporary designation 2003 EL61, with the "2003" based on the date of the Spanish discovery image. On September 7, 2006, it was numbered and admitted into the official minor planet catalogue as (136108) 2003 EL61.
Reaction to the announcement.
The same day as the MPC publication, Brown's group announced the discovery of another Kuiper belt object, , more distant and larger than Pluto, as the tenth planet. The announcement was made earlier than planned to forestall the possibility of a similar events with that discovery, when the MPC told them that their observational data was publicly accessible, and they realized that not only Haumea data but by that time their Eris data had been publicly accessed. The same day Ortiz announced the discovery of Haumea, Brown submitted his own draft with the data on the first of its moons that he had discovered on January 26, 2005 to "The Astrophysical Journal".
Brown, though disappointed at being scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, and explained that someone had accessed their data and he was afraid of being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to tell that it had been him. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.
Official naming.
IAU protocol is that discovery credit for a minor planet goes to whoever first submits a report to the MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz "et al.", and they proposed the name "Ataecina", an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of Roman goddess "Proserpina", which was in turn one of "Pluto"'s lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, "Ataecina" would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not. 
Following guidelines established by the IAU that classical Kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation, in September 2006 the Caltech team submitted formal names from Hawaiian mythology to the IAU for both (136108) 2003 EL61 and its moons, in order "to pay homage to the place where the satellites were discovered". The names were proposed by David Rabinowitz of the Caltech team. "Haumea" is the tutelary goddess of the island of Hawaii, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located. In addition, she is identified with Papa, the goddess of the earth and wife of Wākea (space), which is appropriate because 2003 EL61 is thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock, without the thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known Kuiper belt objects. Lastly, Haumea is the goddess of fertility and childbirth, with many children who sprang from different parts of her body; this corresponds to the swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off the dwarf planet during an ancient collision. The two known moons, also believed to have been born in this manner, were thus named after two of Haumea's daughters, Hiiaka and Nāmaka.
The dispute over who had actually discovered the object delayed the acceptance of any name, or of formal classification of the object as a dwarf planet. On 17 September 2008, the IAU announced that the two bodies in charge of naming dwarf planets, the Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) and the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), had decided on the Caltech proposal of "Haumea". At the CSBN, the outcome of the voting was very close, eventually being decided by a single vote. However, the date of the discovery was listed on the announcement as March 7, 2003, the location of discovery as the Sierra Nevada Observatory, and the name of the discoverer was left blank.
Aftermath.
Brian G. Marsden, head of the MPC at Harvard, and a friend of Brown's, openly supported Brown's claim saying that "Sooner or later, posterity will realise what happened, and Mike Brown will get the full credit". He also went on to state, in reference to the name of the discoverer, which was left blank in the IAU listing, that "It's deliberately vague about the discoverer of the object [...] We don't want to cause an international incident." He called the whole controversy the worst since the early 17th century dispute over who found the four biggest satellites of Jupiter between Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius, ultimately won by Galileo.
The Ortiz team has objected, suggesting that if "Ataecina" were not accepted the IAU could at least have chosen a third name favoring neither party, and accusing the IAU of political bias. Rumors appeared that "Dagda", the name of a god from Irish mythology and a "neutral" name, was indeed proposed by a member of the CSBM but was not used in the end. Ortiz went to say "I am not happy, I think the decision is unfortunate and sets a bad precedent." Spanish media went on to call the decision a "US conquest", asserting that politics played a major role as the US had 10 times more scientists in the IAU than Spain had.
Immediately after the announcement of the name, Brown noted that it is unusual to be allowed to name an object without being acknowledged as its official discoverer but declared that he is pleased with the outcome and that he "think this is as good a resolution as we'll get". He did get full recognition for the discovery of the two moons, Hiiaka and Namaka. On the fifth anniversary of the discovery he wrote a blog with his thoughts on the importance of the discovery, but did not mention any events regarding the controversy.

The Razors Edge world tour was a rock concert tour played by the hard rock band AC/DC, which had 5 legs around the world lasting 12 months starting on 2 November 1990 in Worcester, Massachusetts finishing on 16 November 1991 in Auckland, New Zealand. It was the only tour to feature drummer Chris Slade.
During the tour, the hugely successful Live at Donington show was performed. The show has been released on DVD twice. During 1991, musician Paul Greg had to take over bass in some North American concerts as Cliff Williams suffered a kidney infection. On 18 January 1991, three fans were crushed at a show in Salt Lake City when they fell to the floor during the concert and were stepped on by other concertgoers; however, the show two days later was played as planned. The incident is a sore spot for AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young. The tour was one of the highest-grossing of the 1991 year, and brought AC/DC back into the spotlight after many years of unsuccessful albums.

Enrique Creel

Enrique Clay Creel Cuilty, sometimes known as Henry Clay Creel (30 August 1854 – 18 August 1931) was a Mexican businessman and politician member of the powerful Creel-Terrazas family of Chihuahua. Aside from a prolific career as a banker, industrialist and trader, he was elected alderman, local and federal deputy, ambassador of Mexico to the United States, governor of Chihuahua on two occasions, and served in the cabinet of President Porfirio Díaz as his Minister of Foreign Affairs in the last years of his regime.
Biography.
Creel was the son of Reuben Creel, a veteran of the Mexican American War from Greensburg, Kentucky, and Abraham Lincoln's US Consul in Chihuahua. He was born in Chihuahua, Chihuahua and became son-in-law of don Luis Terrazas by virtue of marriage to his daughter Angela (Reuben Creel and Luis Terrazas were married to sisters of the wealthy Cuilty family, whose ancestry was Irish and was related to Sir Thomas More). 
After Porfirio Díaz became president of Mexico in 1876, he appointed Creel as a director of the National Board of Dynamite and Explosives. Mexico’s demand for explosives was high because of its mining and railroad industries and the army’s need for munitions. The board imposed an 80% import duty on dynamite, allowing its members to manufacture explosives without competition and reportedly enabling Creel to amass an even larger fortune in kickbacks. 
Enrique Creel served as Mexico's Minister of Foreign Relations and as its Ambassador to the United States. He served as interpreter when Presidents Porfirio Díaz and William Howard Taft met in 1909 on the international bridge between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. He became vice-president of the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway, where he was responsible for the construction of part of the railroad west of Chihuahua, now the Chihuahua Pacific Railroad (Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico) and runs through the town of Creel, Chihuahua. His haciendas once totaled more than 1.7 million acres (6,900 km²). 
The Mexican Revolution forced him to abandon Mexico for the United States, though he returned after the end of the revolution, and died in Mexico City on 18 August 1931 .

A Thousand Words (album)

A Thousand Words is the sixth album for artist Styrofoam aka Arne Van Petegem. It is also the first for label Nettwerk.
"A Thousand Words" eschews previous methods of what Styrofoam calls “bedroom producing” in favor of a fresh approach. Breaking the mold from previous Styrofoam albums, which were self-produced, A Thousand Words enlisted the guidance of WAX LTD (Wally Gagel and Xandy Barry), a Los Angeles production team with some pretty varied credits ranging from Sebadoh and Tanya Donelly to The Eels and Folk Implosion—and even the Backstreet Boys and Jessica Simpson. That experience with both indie rock and pop was something Van Petegem found very attractive.
The album features a diverse yet cohesive array of guest vocalists, like Jim Adkins from Jimmy Eat World, Blake Hazard and Josh Rouse. Van Petegem has grown out of the, as he puts it, “shy electronic guy afraid of singing” to return to his roots singing in indie rock bands. He sounds relaxed and joyful as he delivers bright, multi-layered harmonies and simple, thought-provoking lyrics.
"I basically wanted to make an uptempo pop album with big choruses to sing along to. I sort of figured I’d made enough sulky midtempo music for the rest of my life . . . I’m very interested in presenting all these weird sounds, bleeps etc. in a package that is quite accessible overall. But when you listen a little deeper, there is still a lot there to discover."

St. Peter's Church (New Kent, Virginia)

St. Peter's Church is a historic Episcopal church in New Kent, Virginia, United States. Built in 1703, the church was designated as "The First Church of the First First-Lady" by the Virginia General Assembly in 1960 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on March 2, 2012.
History.
St. Peter's Church was established in New Kent County, Virginia, on April 29, 1679. Construction began in 1701 and was complete by 1703. The builder of nearby Foster's Castle, Colonel Joseph Foster, was a vestryman and supervisor of construction at St. Peter's Church.
One of St. Peter's vestrymen, Colonel Daniel Parke Custis, married Martha Dandridge in June 1749. She became a widow after only eight years of marriage. On January 6, 1759, the Rector of St. Peter's, Rev. David Mossom, united Martha Custis and Colonel George Washington in marriage. Debate ensues over the exact location of the marriage; some believe it occurred within the church while others believe it took place a few miles away at the White House Plantation on the Pamunkey River.
Following the American Revolution, the church was abandoned and fell into disrepair. Sometime around 1820, Presbyterians started worshiping at the church. Episcopalian services began again in 1843. Both denominations shared the church, alternating weeks, until 1865. 
Being centrally located in New Kent County, the church suffered greatly during the Civil War. Union soldiers stabled their horses in the pews and carved their names in the brick exterior. On October 23, 1869 General Robert E. Lee wrote “St. Peters is the church where General Washington was married and attended in early life. It would be a shame to America if allowed to go to destruction.” His son, General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee oversaw the partial restoration in 1872.
After being designated as “The First Church of the First First-Lady” by the Virginia General Assembly in 1960, restoration again began on the church with the assistance of architectural and ecclesiological experts. The renovation required making structural improvements to the church and completely gutting the interior.
Architecture.
Constructed of brick laid in Flemish bond, St. Peter's measures by and is one story high. The gable roof has curvilinear gable ends; segmental arches appear over the windows of the church and the open arches of the tower which was added in the mid-eighteenth century replacing an earlier wooden belfry. The two-story brick tower is of Flemish bond with some glazing and has a pyramidal roof. The top of the tower is also decorated by four original stuccoed brick urns. A wing was added sometime before the Revolution but was removed in the middle of the nineteenth century.
The original south doorway and several windows had been bricked up but have been restored as have the curvilinear gable ends for which evidence was found in the fabric of the building during the 1940s and again during the restoration work of 1951-52. Much of the interior and exterior has been restored or replaced in what is thought to be its original condition.

Striking at the Roots

Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism is a non-fiction book by Mark Hawthorne that examines a number of strategies for animal activism in countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. The book was published by O Books in the UK in 2008 as a 282-page paperback (ISBN 978-1846940910).
More than 100 animal activists -- including Carol J. Adams, Gene Baur, Alka Chandna, Nick Cooney, Karen Davis, Joyce D’Silva, Adam Durand, Lisa Franzetta, Juliet Gellatley, Bruce Friedrich, Pattrice Jones, Erik Marcus, Jack Norris, Glenys Oogjes, Lauren Ornelas, Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, Nathan Runkle, Paul Shapiro and Kim Sturla -- discuss the models of activism that work best for advancing animal rights and animal welfare. 
Contents include discussions of leafleting, writing, tabling, protesting, corporate campaigning, legislation, lobbying, multimedia, direct action, and using vegan food as outreach.
Hawthorne says he wrote the book because when he first got into animal activism, he couldn’t find a book like it, “one resource that you could easily carry with you” that covers the broad range of activist models. The book is written for people who are already concerned about abuse of animals and need to learn how to take effective action.
The title is derived from Walden, in which Henry David Thoreau writes: "There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root." Thoreau's phrase "striking at the root" may be an allusion to Matthew 3:10 -- "And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
Hawthorne says he is now working on a book about animal cruelty.

Bancroft Gherardi, Jr.

Bancroft Gherardi, Jr. (April 6, 1873 – August 14, 1941) was a noted American electrical engineer, known for his pioneering work in developing the early telephone systems in the United States. Recognized as one of the foremost authorities in telephone engineering, Gherardi was instrumental in developing the transcontinental telephone service in 1915 and the trans-Atlantic radio telephone service in 1927. He was award the IEEE Edison Medal in 1932 for "contributions to the art of telephone engineering and the development of electrical communication".
Education and service.
Gherardi was born in San Francisco on April 6, 1873, son of Bancroft and Anna Talbot (Rockwell) Gherardi. Gherardi received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1891, and his M.E. and M.M.E degrees from Cornell University in 1893 and 1894, respectively. He received an honorary D. Eng. degree from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1933.
Work.
Gherardi is widely recognized as one of the foremost authorities on early telephone engineering for his role in several landmark projects such as the transcontinental telephone service in 1915 and the trans-Atlantic radio telephone service in 1927. He also personally supervised the construction of a "loaded" cable between New York City and Newark, New Jersey, the first such application based on the invention of Michael I. Pupin that improved the transmission on telephone circuits.
Gherardi was a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and served as its president from 1927 to 1928. He was a member of the United Engineering Society, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Standards Association, New York Electrical Society, and the Franklin Institute. He was also inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and served as the president of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn's alumni association.

1973–74 Montreal Canadiens season

The 1973–74 Montreal Canadiens season was the 65th season in team history. The Canadiens qualified for the playoffs, losing in the first round to the New York Rangers.
Offseason.
Ken Dryden shocked the hockey world as he sat out the entire 1973–74 season. He had won a Vezina Trophy and helped lead Canada past Russia in the dramatic Hockey Summit of 1972. Despite his bargaining power, most players in Dryden's position would have simply accepted what the Canadiens were giving him. Dryden bolted training camp, while general manager Sam Pollock fumed.
Regular season.
Wayne Thomas replaced Dryden as the starting goaltender and appeared in 42 games. Frank Mahovlich led the team in scoring with 80 points, while Yvan Cournoyer led the team in goals with 40.
Playoffs.
The Canadiens qualified for the playoffs in second place, setting up a match-up with the third-place New York Rangers. The Rangers defeated the Canadiens twice at the Forum to win the series four games to two. Rookie goaltender Michel Larocque played all six games for the Canadiens.

Pleurotomariidae

Pleurotomariidae, common name the "slit snails", is a family of large marine gastropods in the clade Vetigastropoda. This family is a very ancient lineage; there were numerous species in the geological past. The
genus includes several hundred fossil forms, mostly Paleozoic. It is one of the oldest gastropod genera, commencing in the Cambrian.
The superfamily is currently represented by a group of species that live only in deep water. This family has no subfamilies.
The first living specimens of a species in this family, "Perotrochus quoyanus", were dredged in 1879 in deep water off the West Indies by the "Blake" expedition of William Healey Dall.[http://books.google.com/books?id=pMpMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA583&lpg=PA583&dq=discovery+of+living+pleurotomaria&source=bl&ots=Zsdr0UHjKA&sig=gJJ2tH_t39qC_NQekKnvlSPmi7I&hl=en&ei=eTrSTuTKGary0gGzxrRA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=discovery%20of%20living%20pleurotomaria&f=false]
Description.
The shell has a trochoidal shape. It is nacreous within. It is umbilicate or imperforate, having a deep slit or sinus in the outer superior margin of the peristome, which serves the purpose of an exhalant phase of respiration., and leaves on the corresponding part of the whorls a peculiarly sculptured band, the "anal fasciole" or the "slit fasciole." The slit is sealed up gradually behind the advancing aperture as the shells grows in size.
The animal has no frontal lobes or appendages. The eyes are situated at the outer bases of the tentacles. The muzzle is as in Trochidae. The tentacles are long,
subcylindrical and bluntly pointed. The broad epipodium (the lateral grooves between foot and mantle) is thin, entire, and fringed with a row of small, short papillae. But it does bear cirri. It is closely applied to the shell. The long radula has a long, narrow rhachidian tooth. It is lanceolate with its tip narrowand recurved. There are 26 laterals with the outer 5 without cusps. The inner ones are larger, with wide cusps and narrower bases. The outside of the laterals consists of 2 rows of uncini (the numerous small teeth-like or hook-like structures). The inner series number 18 and are large, strongly curved, and with scythe-shaped 1-3 denticulate cusps. The outer uncini are very numerous (40-50), small, very oblique. In "Entemnotrochus adansonianus" (Crosse & P. Fischer, 1861) there are considerable differences in the teeth. Some of the uncini bear little tufts of bristles at their apices. The jaws are subobsolete.
Fossil record.
The Pleurotomariidae have a continuous fossil record from the Upper Cambrian onwards. After taking a considerable hit during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, they have been restricted to deeper waters through the Cenozoic. In 2009, a new study in the "Journal of Paleontology" described the first occurrence of Mesozoic pleurotomariids from Antarctica.
Ecology.
Species in the family Pleurotomariidae live at depths of 2000–3000 m as benthos on the bottom in the bathyal zone.
They are preyed upon by crustacea and fish, but are remarkably resistant to attack — they secrete a white fluid when endangered, thought to repel predators. They feed primarily on sponges, and supplement their diet with crinoids and octocorals in the wild; in aquaria, they also feed on fish and clam tissue.

The Seems

The Seems is a children's novel series by John Hulme and Michael Wexler, published by Bloomsbury USA. The series follows the character of Becker Drane, age 12, a "Fixer" in a fictional world called "The Seems"; in the series, The Seems world is responsible for the protection of the reader's "reality" (that is, planet Earth). The series currently includes "The Glitch in Sleep", published in 2007, "The Split Second", published in 2008, and "The Lost Train of Thought", published in 2009. A fourth book, called "A Better Place", has been confirmed, but no release date has been announced yet.
Synopsis.
The series follows Becker Drane, a Fixer for a world called The Seems, which provides our world with resources such as Sleep, Time and Energy.
In the first book, Becker Drane must find and capture a Glitch wreaking havoc in the Department of Sleep. Glitches are creatures with three arms that are able to move very quickly, creating problems wherever they go. With the help of Briefer Simly Frye and Fixer Casey Lake, the three try to Fix this Glitch. After many challenges, Becker manages to find and capture the Glitch.
In the second book, The Tide, using 50 trays of Frozen Moments, has managed to construct a Time Bomb which could cause unimaginable damage to both The World and The Seems. The Fixers are not able prevent the explosion, and Essence is spilled into the World. Becker Drane, Fixer #37, is sent in to recover the bomb, which could still be hazardous. Tom Jackal, Fixer #7, who was thought to be dead, Fixes the bomb but dies in the process. Becker also breaks the Golden Rule, which forbids anyone with access to a Case File for a person in The World to have contact with that person.
In the third book, Becker is found guilty of breaking the Golden Rule by meeting with Jennifer Kaley at the end of "The Split Second". Because of this, he is suspended from duty for a year, and his memories of Jennifer are "unremembered". Jennifer is also unremembered of everything about The Seems. However, before they are both unremembered, a train of Thought goes missing and Becker is called in with three other Fixers to find it. The train is found, and Becker must drive it back. However, all the extra Thought that The Seems had was spent already. To get The World the Thought it needs, Becker drives through to the Inbetweener. He succeeds in getting the Thought back, but he crashes into the dangerously low entrance and may not have survived. Jennifer receives a job in The Seems, but at Becker's request, she is still unremembered about Becker and The Seems.
A fourth book, titled "A Better Place", has been confirmed on the official website for the series. "Chapter Zero" of the book is available to read, but no release date or cover have been given yet.
Themes.
In the first book, "suffering and its purpose in the world" serves as one of the themes. A review of the first installment has noted the meaningful purpose of the Bed Bugs, despite many of the older child characters' refusal to purchase them. It has been suggested that the Bed Bug characters show that suffering is a necessary aspect of existence, with Nightmares used as an analogy in the novel; authors Hulme and Wexler portray dreams that require the occurrence of scary elements before the pleasant content takes place.
In an article in the "Children's Book Examiner", Diane Bloom wrote: "The Seemsians, especially our protagonist Becker Drane, have strong ethics, remain true to their goals and do the right thing, and they understand and buy into doing your part for society and following the rules that accompany life."
Reception.
The series has been well reviewed. "Publishers Weekly" said that "the authors use the conceit to the fullest, creating a complex and intricate world with a sometimes daunting array of gadgets, bureaucracy, vocabulary and capitalization (a glossary is included—and welcome)" yet at the same time "these details don't become overwhelming, fortunately, thanks to the book's consistently lighthearted tone". A review by "Booklist" praised the audiobook version and described the series as very imaginative.
"Newsday" commented that the book can be read just for fun or can also be "mulled over for its implied questions about big philosophical issues". In a review in "School Library Journal", the first book was called "a rollicking tale"; the review praised the characters while comparing it to Garth Nix's "The Keys to the Kingdom" series.
The second book also received many positive reviews. Another review from "School Library Journal" praised the audiobook version but commented that background information would be needed for new readers.
"Booklist" said that the second book was just as good as the first and has an "ingenious setting". However, "Kirkus Reviews" criticized the book's predictability.
Awards.
The first book, The Glitch in Sleep, was nominated for the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award and a Vermont children’s choice award. It was also chosen as one of Amazon's Best Books of the Year (2007) for "Middle Readers" (older children) along with nine other books. It was also named an Autumn Book Sense Children's pick in 2007.
The second book ranked fifth on a list of the 20 best books for middle schoolers in 2008 by reviewer Diane Bloom.
Movie adaption.
Film rights to the first book have been acquired by Twentieth Century Fox, but no release has been yet planned. The movie will be directed by Shawn Levy, who directed "Night at the Museum" and "". Levy first decided to make a movie when he read the book and loved it. He later met up with John Hulme and Michael Wexler during one of their book tours to show them what the movie would look like. This story was also on the cover of the magazine Variety. Shawn Levy said:"This is such a visually original and fresh world, where memory, weather, sleep and things like that are created. I've been working with Fox to find the next major all-audience franchise, and we feel that if we nail the screenplay, this has the potential to fit that bill, with the same humor, family friendliness, and lack of condescension."

<doc id="19513892" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19513892" title="Jayavarman IV">
Jayavarman IV

Jayavarman IV () was an Angkorian king who ruled from 928 to 941 CE. Many early historians thought that he was a usurper. However, recent evidence shows that he had a legitimate claim to the throne.
Early Years.
He was the son of king Indravarman I's daughter, Mahendradevi, and was married to his aunt, a half-sister of king Yasovarman I. Because there were no clear rules of succession, his claim for the throne through a maternal line seemed to be valid. He contested the reigns of Yasovarman I's sons at Angkor since the death of their father. In 921 he set up his own capital at Koh Ker: an inscription dated 921 states, "Jayavarman IV left the city of Yashodharapura to reign at "Chok Gargyar" taking the Devaraja with him." The rivalry lasted from 921 until the death of Ishanavarman II in 928, after which Jayavarman IV reigned supreme.
Koh Ker.
Famous for its ancient ruins, Koh Ker can be reached more easily then in recent past thanks to a payment road. This old capital city of Jayavarman IV remained abandoned for over a thousand years before French scholars, like Louis Delaporte and Étienne Aymonier, had been visiting and studying at the end of 19th century. During his reign the capital city was known as "Chok Gargyar" (the Island of Glory) or "Lingapura". There was a walled city of about 1200 m2, but subsidiary temples are scattered on a surrounding area of 35 square kilometers. The main zone encompasses the "Rahal" baray (1,188 x 548 m) and Prasat Thom complex, with its seven-tiered pyramid 30 metres high. The summit of the temple housed a colossal "linga", now disappeared, probably made of metal casing as high as almost 5 metres. Inscription K.187E designates the Old Khmer name for this linga as "kamrateṅ jagat ta rājya", “the god who is the king”. "Jayavarman IV's inscriptions boasted that his constructions surpassed those of previous kings." A large number of the best and largest Angkorian sculptures were made during his reign, e.g. the Garuda standing in the entrance of National Museum of Cambodia. A royal highway lead to Beng Mealea at south and to Angkor at west.
Tax Collection.
To build a magnificent city in such a short period of about 20 years, it must have required an enormous amount of wealth and labor. The majority of Jayavarman's inscriptions are from Koh Ker, but they had been found also in sites on the borders of khmer dominion, as Nong Pang Puey (near Aranyaprathet)) and Phnom Bayang (Mekong Delta). They shed some lights as to how this was being done. Labor forces were gathered from many provinces and taxes were paid in kind: such as, rice, wax, honey, elephants or cloth. Contrast to many ancient civilizations, Angkor did not mint any coin to use as currency. Tax collection in those days was probably performed by a "tamrvac" (modern: "tamruot", or policeman). A "tamrvac" or “royal inspector” had his real authority in the provinces. Taxes were collected from all the territories that Jayavarman IV had controlled. The tax collection system was very efficient if not brutal. As for those who refused to pay, they will be "caged by the elders and placed before the king for sentence." However, the king, palace functionaries, monks and slaves were exempt from paying taxes.
Posthumous Name.
Jayavarman IV died in 941 and received the posthumous name of Paramashivapada. His succession was not peacefully and his young son Harshavarman II reigned briefly until 944. Then Rajendravarman, who was both uncle and first cousin of Harshavarman, returned the capital at Yasodharapura.

Rhaphischismatidae

Rhaphischismatidae is an extinct family of fossil sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the superorder Vetigastropoda. They date from the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian). The family contains a single genus, "Raphischisma". In the Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005), this family is assigned to the Pleurotomariacea.
Genera.
Raphischisma is the only known genus. Its description is that of the family.
Description.
"Rhaphycasma" is characterized by a discoidal shell with a rounded periphery, depressed spire, umbilical callus formed by the inward extension of the lower aperture lip, and a deep, narrow slit, that extends along the upper surface, near the upper suture. The unique features of the lower lip generate an umbilical callus and deep, long, exhalent slit on the upper side along with the generally smooth form. These shell characters set this genus, and family, apart from other gastropods in the same superfamily.

Palmer Woods

The Palmer Woods Historic District is a residential historic district bounded by Seven Mile Road, Woodward Avenue, and Strathcona Drive in Detroit, Michigan. There are approximately 289 homes in the district. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The Detroit Golf Club is nearby.
History.
The Palmer Woods Historic District is named after Thomas W. Palmer, a prominent citizen of nineteenth-century Detroit and a United States Senator. Palmer's estate included land on both sides of Woodward Avenue, stretching from Six Mile Road to Eight Mile Road. During his lifetime, Palmer donated some of his land to the city of Detroit to establish Palmer Park, and gave additional land to the state of Michigan to build the Michigan State Fairgrounds.
Palmer died in 1913; two years later, Detroit real-estate developer Charles W. Burton purchased the section of Palmer's estate that now encompasses the Palmer Woods Historic District. Burton envisioned an exclusive neighborhood, catering to Detroit's richest citizens, with room for spacious and elegant homes. He hired the landscape architect Ossian Cole Simonds to design the layout of the development. Cole laid out a subdivision with gently curving streets, capitalizing on the natural beauty of the area and creating a parklike atmosphere in the neighborhood. Curbs are nonexistent, minimizing the transition from street to lawn and discouraging pedestrian traffic, and every lot in the neighborhood had a unique shape. The neighborhood received the Michigan Horticultural Society's Award of Merit in 1938 for being the finest platted subdivision in Michigan.
Many Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival styled homes were constructed between about 1917 and 1929. After World War II, additional mansions were constructed.
Architecture.
Palmer Woods is known for its elm-lined streets, large brick and stone homes in Tudor Revival architecture, set back from the street behind contiguous uninterrupted lawn. Lots are large, with ample room for trees, play equipment, and a good expanse of grass. There may be Scottish coats of arms, leaded stained glass windows, and other features, such as elevators in some of the homes. Some of the properties boast more than one structure: such as a house and guest house, or maids' quarters. Streets gently curve through the forested neighborhood.
Palmer Woods has its own security service and an active voluntary neighborhood association. The home of physicians, politicians, business owners, artists, executives and their families, the Palmer Woods neighborhood has attracted some of Detroit's most prominent citizens. Charles W. Burton himself made his home in the neighborhood. Two of the seven Fisher Brothers (owners of Fisher Body), Alfred and William, also lived in the neighborhood. William Fisher's house, on Wellesley, is , one of the largest in Detroit. John H. Kunsky, the founder of United Artists theatres, also lived in the area.
Almost every house in Palmer Woods has unique architectural features, but a number are particularly important. At the southern edge of the district is the Dorothy H. Turkel House, the only house in Detroit designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. C. Howard Crane, the noted theater architect, designed the home of John H. Kunsky, incorporating many theater elements into the design. Minoru Yamasaki and Leonard Willeke also designed houses in the district.
Bishop Gallagher House.
Probably the most significant home in the district is the 62-room Bishop Gallagher residence. The home was built for the Fisher Brothers in 1925, who hired the Boston firm of McGinnis and Walsh, specialists in ecclesiastical architecture, to design the Tudor Revival mansion. Upon completion, the Fishers gave the mansion to Bishop Michael Gallagher, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. The home is the largest within the city of Detroit.
The two-story brick residence, a large central structure flanked by diagonal wings. There are numerous exterior bays, each topped with a parapet capped with masonry and a finial. Religious themes are included throughout the house, both on the exterior and the interior. On the exterior, medallions, shields and crests are set into the brickwork, and a copper statue of the archangel St. Michael defeating Satan is prominent. The interior is finished with oak, stone and masonry. The house had, at one time, the largest collection of Pewabic glazed pottery tile in Michigan.
Bishop Gallagher lived in this home until his death in 1937. Subsequent archbishops of Detroit Cardinals Edward Mooney and John Francis Dearden also lived in the home. Upon Cardinal Dearden's death, the archdiocese sold the house to John Salley of the Detroit Pistons. Forbidden Fruits (2006), a movie produced by Marc Cayce, was filmed inside the Bishop Gallagher residence.
Education.
Palmer Woods is within the Detroit Public Schools district. Residents are zoned to Palmer Park Preparatory Academy, formerly the Barbara Jordan School, for elementary and middle school. All residents are zoned to Mumford High School. Palmer Park is operated by teachers and not by a principal administrator.

Irving Goff

Irving Goff (1900 - 17 May 1989) was a member of the Communist Party USA and the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, a unit that volunteered to fight during the Spanish Civil War for the Popular Front. During World War II, he was a member of the American Office of Strategic Services, and was instrumental in setting up guerrilla units working behind enemy lines in North Africa and Italy. His exploits as a guerrilla in Spain are considered to be the inspiration for Ernest Hemingway's novel "For Whom the Bell Tolls".
Biography.
Irving Goff's parents, of Jewish origin, emigrated from Odessa, Russia to New York in 1900. He grew up in the streets of Brooklyn and Long Island. He was a premier body builder (famous as the "Adonis" of Coney Island's Muscle Beach) and worked as an adagio dancer and professional acrobat before becoming an organiser for the Communist party in New York.
Goff arrived in Spain on 4 April 1937, where he joined the International Brigades, working as a driver. In December 1937, he volunteered for dangerous guerrilla operations which frequently required him to work behind enemy lines for up to weeks at a time. Working with fellow International Brigaders Alex Kunslich and William Aalto, Goff was trained by Soviet instructors in the use of pressure-sensitive explosives to destroy railroad tracks, bridges and power lines. Goff would later recall these periods behind enemy lines:
One of their objectives was the destruction of the main supply bridge spanning the Albarracín River. The operation may have been the inspiration for Ernest Hemingway's novel "For Whom the Bell Tolls". When the book was published in 1940, Goff was critical of the novelist's ignorance of guerrilla operations and the way in which war was treated from ""a romantic adventuristic point of view rather than the grim, practical war that it was"". In a later interview he said:
At the end of 1937, Goff took part in the Battle of Teruel, working behind enemy lines again with Kunslich, Aalto and Spanish guerrillas. On 23 May 1938, Goff, took part in the successful amphibious operation at Carchuna, Motril on the southern coast of Spain, which resulted in the rescue of 300 Republican prisoners held in the Fort of Carchuna. This raid constitutes the only operation of its kind ever undertaken by the Spanish army.
In September 1938, with a Republican defeat in sight, the Abraham Lincoln Battalion was withdrawn from the front line and shortly afterwards disbanded. Irving Goff returned to the United States.
Once home, he resumed his activities in the Communist Party, and in 1940 was sent on a mission to investigate pro-fascist "synarchista" organizations in Texas, California and Mexico. Posing as a newspaper reporter, Goff filed regular reports about these groups with party leaders, but failed in his effort to link them with the right-wing group America First. 
Goff continued to campaign for the Spanish cause, and in February 1941, he led 28 Lincoln veterans in a Peace Motorcade to Capitol Hill to lobby against Francoist Spain receiving Lend-Lease aid.
In 1941, Goff was approached by former Abraham Lincoln Battalion commander Milton Wolff to work for British intelligence through the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). On Goff's advice, Wolff invited other Lincoln veterans to participate in the group, including William Aalto, Milton Felsen, Mike Jiminez, Vince Lossowski and Alfred Tanz. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the OSS leader General William Donovan turned the project into a wholly American operation. In 1942, Goff was transferred to North Africa, where he was put in charge of training Spanish recruits to operate behind German lines. Here, he was promoted by Donovan to second lieutenant.
After the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943, the OSS Lincolns moved to Naples, where Goff's previous experience in Spain proved a boon for American intelligence. He was appointed by the OSS as liaison officer to the Italian Communist Party, and the Americans promptly started training programmes, using Italian volunteers to wage guerrilla warfare behind the German lines in northern Italy. Goff's infiltration programs parachuted thirty teams of radio operators and meteorologists into enemy-held areas to provide daily weather reports for the Allied air forces. Working with the Italian Communists, Goff built the most effective intelligence operation in northern Italy. With multiple teams behind German lines, he could count on fourteen separate radio reports every day. ""We had guerrillas operating on every highway, every railroad, every German convoy. We had identifications, the material in every car on every highway reported through the network of radios"".
After the war, Goff became the Communist Party's district organiser in New Orleans. During Henry A. Wallace's 1948 presidential campaign Goff encouraged black voter registration, agitated on behalf of black prisoners and jeopardized his life on several occasions by ignoring southern racial customs.
Irving Goff died in May 1989 in Los Angeles after a longtime heart condition. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Kirk Matthew Lankford (born 1985) is an American from Kalihi, Hawaii who was convicted of murdering a Japanese tourist in Pūpūkea, Hawaii.
On April 12, 2007, Japanese tourist Masumi Watanabe disappeared in Pūpūkea. Lankford was arrested and charged with second-degree murder on April 26, 2007, after police found blood and items belonging to Watanabe in his pickup truck. Watanabe's body was never found, but the blood in Lankford's truck was determined to have been Watanabe's.
At his trial, Lankford pleaded not guilty. In his trial testimony, Lankford claimed that he had accidentally hit Watanabe with his truck, but that she had not been seriously injured and he offered to give her a ride to her destination. Lankford claims that after he began driving with Watanabe in the truck, she jumped out of the moving vehicle and hit her head on a rock by the road. When Lankford discovered that she had died, he says, he disposed of her body in the ocean because he said he was frightened that he would lose his job. Prior to his trial, Lankford had told police he had never seen Watanabe before.
The jury found Lankford guilty of second-degree murder. At his sentencing hearing, Circuit Judge Karl Sakamoto referred to Lankford as a "predator" and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Peter Carlisle, the city prosecutor, asked the parole board for 120-years minimum imprisonment.

William Lawrence Bottomley

William Lawrence Bottomley, born February 24, 1883 in New York, New York, was a noted architect in twentieth-century New York, New York, Middleburg, Virginia and Richmond, Virginia. He is admired as one of the preeminent Colonial Revival designers of residential buildings in the United States and many of his commissions are situated in highly aspirational locations, including Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia.
Education.
Educated at the prestigious Horace Mann School in New York, Bottomley graduated from Columbia University in 1906 with a bachelor of science degree in architecture. In 1907 he studied at the American Academy in Rome, where he had received the McKim Fellowship in Architecture. In 1908 he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, in the "atelier" of Victor Laloux, where he studied until he returned to the US to practice formally as an architect in 1909.
Personal life.
William Lawrence married Harriet Townsend, a sculptor and writer, on August 26, 1909 at Beech Hill in Westport, New York. Harriet's love for gardening no doubt influenced William's strong alliance with landscape architect Charles Gillette. William and Harriet had three daughters: Harriet, Susan and Virginia.
Career.
In his 40-year career, William designed 186 commissions, the majority of which (40%) were in Virginia. "Bottomley's clients...while well-to-do, didn't have names with the lofty status of Rockefeller, Whitney, or Widener." Eleven of Bottomley's commissions are currently listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places. Eight of these are in Virginia.
William Lawrence Bottomley designed this residence at 155 Western Promenade in Portland, Maine.
"Walter Davis, son of a prominent Portland family, was a graduate of Yale and of Harvard Law School. Very much a modern man in his professional life–as an attorney he was active in the affairs of banks and railroads in the state–he was, in his private life, a dedicated historian. For many years he was president of the Maine Historical Society, and like many of his generation and class, Davis was a dedicated Anglophile, visiting England regularly. His Cape Elizabeth summer house was a pure adaptation of a 16th-century Cotswold manor house. For his city house on Portland’s Western Promenade, he chose to visit the 18th century, evoking the England of Johnson and Boswell, by duplicating an English manor in the early 18th century style. For his architect, he chose William Lawrence Bottomley, a society architect noted for his sophisticated brick Georgian houses in Virginia and Long Island, in association with Leigh French, Jr., a New York architect-decorator best known today for his early books about Colonial interiors.
According to Maine State Historian Earle Shettleworth, Jr., who knew Davis, the model was a manor house that Davis had seen on a bicycle tour of England, likely the charming Stuart-style brick manor at Chipping Camden, whose design and composition were closely followed in the Davis house with a few differences–notably the balconet over the entrance, in the Portland house–as translated to a city lot. It was one of the last of the large houses built on the Western Promenade (1920), and its very proper Englishness added a new style note to the eclectic mix already present in the neighborhood. Inside, high paneled rooms; tall, deeply recessed windows; and Georgian chimneypieces made a reassuringly correct backdrop in which the Dowager Countess might feel at home, not surprising as Davis originally shared this house with his mother, who had formerly lived around the corner in the grand Edwardian mansion that John Calvin Stevens had designed for Walter Davis Sr. nearly four decades earlier."
In 1918, young U.S. Army lawyer Walter G. Davis, Jr. worked with the American Commission to Negotiate Piece in Paris, resulting in the Treaty of Versailles, where Europe was divided after World War I. Two years later, he swept into fashionable 155 Western Promenade, with its 32-foot salon for entertaining; inset Grand Tour paintings collected by Davis during his travels; and a library featuring a priceless Zuber & Cie mural from Paris: the Boston panel of Views of North America.
His work is now the subject of the Historic Richmond Foundation's Year of Bottomley events.

United to the Left

United to the Left ("Uniti a Sinistra") was a network of leftist groups associated with the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC) in Italy from 2005 to 2009. At some point it claimed to have 20,000 members and 300 clubs all around Italy.
In April 2005 Pietro Folena (a leading member of the Democrats of the Left who had been a close aide of Walter Veltroni) and Francesco Martone (a splinter from the Federation of the Greens) left their parties in order to join the PRC.
In July 2008 they formed "United to the Left" as a network of left-wing groups which wanted to take part to Fausto Bertinotti's project of the European Left, along with Antonello Falomi (a former deputy leader of the Democrats of the Left in the Senate who had followed Achille Occhetto into an alliance with Italy of Values for the 2004 European Parliament election) and two leading members of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Paolo Nerozzi and Gianni Rinaldini. The group was later joined by Maura Cossutta, daughter of Armando and leading member of the Party of Italian Communists.
In the 2006 general election Folena, Falomi and Martone were all re-elected to Parliament in PRC's list. In 2007 United to the Left was a keen supporter of The Left – The Rainbow alliance with the Greens, the Italian Communists and Democratic Left.
After the alliance was trounced by voters in 2008 general election and the "Bertinottiani" had lost the leadership of the PRC to the internal left in the 24-27 July 2008, United to the Left subsequently ended its collaboration with the PRC. In November 2009 Folena joined the Democratic Party.

Renault Monastella

The Renault Monastella (Type RY1) was an compact luxury car manufactured between late 1928 and 1933 by Renault. It shared the mechanical elements and bodywork options of the Renault Monasix but was differentiated by superior levels of finish and equipment.
Details and Evolutions.
The Monastella was a more luxurious version of the Monasix which had itself first appeared at the 1927 Paris Motor Show. The 8CV Monastella was released for 1929 at the October 1928 motor show with a small 6-cylinder engine of 1476 cc. Apart from the superior equipment levels, it was differentiated from the Monasix by a plate that said "carrosserie STELLA": at a time when names for cars that went beyond defining their engine size and type, this badge stressed the manufacturer's determination to differentiate the two models.
Initially the radiator was positioned behind the engine, reflecting the normal layout for Renault engine compartments during most of the 1920s. However, starting with the massive new Reinastella at the end of 1928, Renault moved the radiator to a more conventional position ahead of the engine, and by time of the next motor show, in October 1929, all Renaults including the Monastella's, lost the old "wind-cutter" grill-free front panel, in favour of a conventional front grill, reflecting the positioning of the radiator to a more "normal" position, just ahead of the engine block. (This also meant an end to the prominent "gills" just ahead of the doors on the sides of the hood/bonnet that had formerly directed air onto the curiously positioned radiator.)
In 1931 the new engine is more powerful with 33HP and new grill.
In 1933 ceased the production and the car was replaced by the Renault Primastella.

Margretta Styles

Margretta Madden Styles, EdD, RN, FAAN (1930 - Nov. 20, 2005) was an American nurse, author, educator and nursing school dean who conceived and helped establish national standards for certifying nurses in pediatrics, cardiology and other medical specialties. Dr. Styles was the president of the American Nurses Association from 1986 to 1988, and wrote five books and many articles published in medical journals. 
Career.
Margretta Styles was born in Mount Union, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania with degrees in biology and chemistry, and earned her master's degree in nursing at Yale University, and her doctorate in education from the University of Florida. In 1967, Styles became an associate professor of nursing at Duke University, and later served as dean of nursing at the University of Texas at San Antonio; then at Wayne State University, in Detroit, Michigan, and from 1977 through 1987 at the University of California, San Francisco.
During the 1970s, Styles played a significant role in efforts to develop stricter certification of nurses and a compliance system to regulate nurses. Styles wrote extensively on advanced nursing practices for nursing journals, advocating strict criteria for issuing nursing credentials.
In the 1980s, Styles was instrumental in the founding of the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC), which is now a major unit of the American Nurses Association; the ANCC administers testing for more than twenty medical specialties, helping to standardize professional expectations of nurses. Styles was elected president of the International Council of Nurses in 1993, after turning her attention to the importance of trained nurses in developing countries.
Recognition.
Styles continues to be quoted widely in medical publications. The Margretta Styles Grant, presented by the Institute for Credentialing Innovation, encourages research on the impact of credentialing processes on nurses and the profession, as well as the accumulation of evidenced-based data to support quality patient care. The UCSF School of Nursing presents the Margretta Styles Distinguished Nurse Award. Styles was inducted into the American Nurses Association hall of fame, was the recipient of numerous awards, including the International Council of Nurses' Christiane Reimann Award, regarded as nursing's most prestigious international honor, and was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing and the National Institute of Medicine.
Family.
Styles was married for 47 years to the Reverend Douglas Styles, an Episcopalian priest who died in 2002. The couple raised two sons and a daughter, and had two grandchildren. Their son, Mike Styles, was the founder and race director of the Midnight Sun Run in Fairbanks, Alaska.

Hackney Wick Wolves

Hackney Wick Wolves speedway opened in 1935 at Hackney Wick Stadium, Waterden Road, London, and operated until the outbreak of World War II in 1939.
History.
The Walthamstow Wolves closed at the end of the 1934 season and the team moved into Hackney Stadium. The first meeting was held on 26 April 1935 although the first official meeting was a week later on 3 May when Hackney lost to the New Cross Lambs in the National League. 
On 15 May 1936, Hackney rider Dusty Haigh died from a broken skull in a crash at the track after falling whilst in the lead and being struck by another rider's machine.
Captain Dicky Case qualified for the first ever Speedway World Championship final at Wembley in 1936, but decided to retire at the end of the 1937 season.
Crowds were not large enough to support top level speedway so, in 1938, Hackney swapped licenses with the Bristol Bulldogs and dropped down to the second tier. This meant the big name stars at the Wick went too. However, the Wolves won the National League Division II Championship that season.
Hackney stadium did not host speedway again immediately after the Second World War until 1963 when the Hackney Hawks were founded.

Krider Performing Arts Center

Krider Performing Arts Center (KPAC) is an auditorium in Paris, Henry County, Tennessee, United States. The building is attached to the Paris Elementary School, which frequently makes use of the auditorium. KPAC consists of a full stage with curtains, backstage/props room, green room, piano room, sound booth, catswalk, lobby with a ticket counter, and a large auditorium that can seat roughly 500-600 people.
Uses.
Aside from the frequent use by the elementary school, the city also uses KPAC. Professionals and other traveling groups have graced the auditorium, usually drawing more crowds than locally sponsored programs, though both types' audience turn-outs don't always depend on the performer(s). Paris city schools (grades preschool through eighth) have free in-school music programs that use KPAC for general music, strings, and band concerts.
It also hosts various both profit and non-profit groups throughout the year. Because the auditorium has the sound booth and stage, musical and promotional groups also book appearances. Recently, community churches have taken short residency on Sundays. Since the accommodations and services at KPAC are relatively convenient for the area, the auditorium is popular among the region. 
The Krider Center is used yearly for theatrical purposes, too.
KPAC programs.
"Krider Idol".
KPAC holds auditions for a program called "Krider Idol", a semi-mock of the popular TV show "American Idol".
Drama programs.
They also have a summer theater workshop called Children's Theater and a winter one called Winter Workshop, founded winter 2007. For a small fee, the enrolled students spend several weeks during the summer and/or winter in which instructors both direct and teach the students in three plays based for three different age groups: 5-8; 9-12; 13–18 years old. Anyone in the area can audition for the play in their age group; if the students above a certain age want to participate in the play, but don't want a role, they can sign up to join the stage crew. These people work behind the scenes learning skills from an experienced instructor such as building the sets used in the actual play, how to manage the props, and learning to operate the stage's mechanical components. The entire cast attend practices and learn about the art of drama. These plays rely heavily on their sets, and the actors wear costumes when on stage performing.
History.
KPAC's name is taken from a Paris, Tennessee, couple, Clem and Ruby Krider. For more than 60 years, they played a major role in the art community of Henry County. Ruby taught public speaking and drama to many generations of Parisians, a few being Tony winner Cherry Jones, Pulitzer Prize winner John Noble Wilford, "Cheers" star Shelley Long, Vanderbilt law professor Robert Covington, and Ford Motor Company Controller Frank Mason. 
In the summer of 2003, KPAC was minorly hit by a tornado passing through the Henry County area. The lobby windows and such were damaged. It wasn't damaged nearly as badly, though, as one of the nearby wings of the Paris Elementary School; the third-grade hallway of the building had to be rebuilt. While the school wing took several months to repair, KPAC was soon and again opened to the public.

Orenco D

The Orenco D was an American biplane fighter aircraft, designed by Orenco and built by Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. It was the first fighter type of completely indigenous design (as opposed to foreign types or American-built versions of foreign types) to enter US military service.
Development.
The D prototype was offered to the US Army Air Service at the end of 1918. It was a two-bay biplane, constructed of all wood and covered with fabric. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza engine. The pilot of the first flight test, Clarence B. Coombs, gave it a positive evaluation: "This aircraft performs better than the Sopwith Camel and Snipe, the Thomas-Morse, the Nieuport and Morane Parasol, the Spad and S.V.A." The military ordered 50 production aircraft, but put the production order up for bidding. Curtiss Aircraft entered the lowest bid and built the fighter, modifying it slightly with a wider wingspan and redesigned ailerons. The first Curtiss Orenco D flew on 26 August 1921.

Activities.
Duke of Edinburgh Award.
The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme is a voluntary, non-competitive programme of practical, cultural and adventurous activities for young people aged 14–25. The Award programme consists of three levels, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Each have differing criteria for entry and the level of achievement necessary to complete each award. Cadets who meet the age criteria can join the award scheme.
Each award is broken down into 4 areas (5 for gold) which participants must complete successfully to receive their award. These are:-
Helping others in the local community.
Training for, and planning of a journey.
Demonstrate ability in almost any hobby, skill or interest
Sport, dance and fitness.
A purposeful enterprise with young people not previously known to the participant.
Cadets are often encouraged to achieve the Bronze, Silver and Gold awards as they progress through their cadet careers. Some cadets aged 16 or over used to be able to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh's Millennium Volunteers Award, this has now been overtaken by another authority and it is currently being reviewed on whether or not cadets will be able to undertake it as it has a new structure.
The Award is widely recognised by employers as it helps demonstrate that award holders are keen to take on new challenges, have a higher level of self-confidence than their counterparts, have leadership qualities with the added experience of teamwork.
Aviation Award.
There is opportunity for all Cadets within the GVCAC to undertake practical Gliding and Powered Flying this is underpinned by training courses in Aviation subjects and are an integral part of the Challenge Award as well as being an award within itself
Drill and Etiquette.
The GVCAC, as a uniformed youth organization, sets itself and its members very high standards, including dress and behaviour. Drill (marching) is a vital part of encouraging teamwork, discipline, co-operation and self-confidence. Practicing drill is a means of instilling discipline and teamwork, it is also used in formal parades, for moving around military bases and moving cadets in a smart and orderly fashion. The Corps instills good manners and customs (Etiquette) into cadets behaviours this transfers into having respect for each other, their family and is often well received by prospective employers.
Outdoor/Adventure Activities.
These include:
Physical Recreation.
The GVCAC offers its several sporting activities and thus encourage its members to lead healthy lives.
Flying and Gliding Scholarships.
RAFA Flying Scholarship.
The Royal Air Force Association each year invites applications from both ATC and GVCAC for a limited number of flying scholarships. In 2008 Nicole Pogmore from Rotherham was successful in being awarded an RAFA scholarship.
Ducat-Amos Gliding Scholarships.
In 2007 six grants were awarded to GVCAC Cadets which enabled attendance on a weekend course at a local gliding club.
History.
The GVC has its origins in 1940 as part of the National Association of Training Corps for Girls, this umbrella organisation was responsible for the Girls Training Corps (GTC), Girls' Nautical Training Corps (GNTC) and Women’s Junior Air Corps (WJAC).
First woman to break sound barrier.
Former Air Transport Auxiliary Pilot, Diana Barnato Walker became a pilot for the Women's Junior Air Corps (WJAC) shortly after the war, giving cadets training and air-experience flights to air-minded teenage girls to encourage them to enter the aviation industry. In July 1948, an aircraft that she was flying burst into flames at near White Waltham. Rather than bale out and lose the WJAC’s aircraft, she switch off the fuel and glided the aircraft back. In 1963 she undertook a flight in an English Electric Lightning, attaining 1,262 mph (Mach 1.65) in a two-seat T.4 trainer and thus became the first British woman to exceed the speed of sound.
Girls Venture Corps.
In 1964 the Girls Venture Corps replaced both GTC and WJAC, the previous year (1963) the Girls Nautical Training Corps became more closely involved with the Sea Cadet Corps and in 1980 had become an integral part of the Sea Cadet Corps and they lost their individual identity. The Girls Venture Corps had two wings which basically followed the former GTC and WJAC either would sometimes share unit accommodation with both ACF and ATC, with Girls being allowed to join both the Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps in around 1983 the GVAC had to decide on which activities to concentrate on, they chose air activities so the whole corps wore the same uniform. In 1987 the title of the organisation was changed to Girls Venture Corps Air Cadets.

Reşat Ekrem Koçu

Reşat Ekrem Koçu (1905–July 6, 1975) was a Turkish writer and historian. His best known work is his unfinished Istanbul Encyclopedia ("İstanbul Ansiklopedisi"), which recounts many tales of Istanbul from Ottoman times. Koçu and his colorful depictions of Ottoman Istanbul are celebrated in Orhan Pamuk's book "".
Life.
Koçu was born in İstanbul. After completing his high-school education at "Bursa Erkek Lisesi" in the north-western town of Bursa, Koçu studied history at İstanbul University, where he later worked as a researcher of the Ottoman period. From 1933, in the wake of Atatürk's secularist reform of the Turkish university system, Koçu taught history in the high schools of Alman, Kuleli, Pertevniyal and Vefa in Istanbul. During his teaching years, Koçu also published poems, stories and novels.
Works.
Koçu's best known work is his Istanbul Encyclopedia ("İstanbul Ansiklopedisi"), which evokes many different aspects of the ancient city, including many stories from Ottoman times. The first volume of this unfinished work was brought out by Koçu in 1958. In 1973, financial difficulties forced Koçu to interrupt composition at the eleventh volume, while still working on the letter B. The text is accompanied by fanciful line illustrations.
Koçu's other works include "Forsa Halil" (1962), "Patrona Halil" (1967), "Erkek Kızlar" (1962), "Haşmetli Yosmalar" (1962), "Türk Giyim, Kuşam ve Süsleme Sözlüğü" (1967), "Osmanlı Padişahları" (1960) and "Eski İstanbul’da Meyhaneler ve Meyhane Köçekleri" (1947).
Legacy.
The novelist Orhan Pamuk describes Koçu as a major source of inspiration during his childhood years. An entire section of Pamuk's largely autobiographical work "" is devoted to Koçu.

The Dome of the Ascension (, transliteration: "Qubbat al-Miraj") is a free-standing dome that commemorates the Islamic prophet Muhammad's ascension to heaven. It is located just north the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. 
It is not clear when the original dome was built, but is assumed to have been either Ummayad or Abbasid work, because it is mentioned by Ibn al-Fakih in 903 CE and by al-Muqaddasi in 985 CE as being one of the "two minor domes"; the other being the Dome of the Prophet. However, the modern-day Dome of the Ascension was built by the Ayyubid governor of Jerusalem, Izz ad-Din az-Zanjili in 1200 from Crusader construction materials.

Better than sex cake

Better than sex cake, also known as Is It Really Better Than Sex? Cake or Better than Robert Redford cake, is a cake consisting of yellow cake mix, a moist center, and whipped cream covering the exterior. Some versions of the recipe are very similar to an upside-down cake. The cake's origins are unknown and recipes exist from the 1980s, but the recipe received a surge in popularity after Paula Deen featured the dessert on her series "Paula's Home Cooking".
The cake's moist center is typically created by inserting a fork into the cake several times and filling the holes with a mixture containing sugar and a flavoring or fruit such as pineapple. It is traditionally baked using a 13 by 9 by 2-inch pan and then refrigerated and eaten cold. The basic recipe for the cake has been altered depending on the tastes of the person making the cake and alternates include chocolate, banana, or candy flavors.

HMS Inconstant (1783)

HMS "Inconstant" was a 36-gun "Perseverance" class fifth rate frigate of the Royal Navy. She had a successful career serving in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, capturing three French warships during the French Revolutionary naval campaigns, the "Curieux", the "Unité", and the former British ship .
Construction and commissioning.
"Inconstant" was ordered on 8 December 1781 and laid down at the yards of William Barnard, Deptford, in December 1782. She was launched on 28 October 1783, and was immediately fitted out for ordinary, a process completed by 22 March 1784. She was moved to Woolwich in October 1788 and there fitted out for sea between June and November 1790. She had cost a total of £16,226.0.1d (including the work to fit her for ordinary, with a further £6,627 spent in 1790 to prepare her for sea.
Career.
"Inconstant" was commissioned in August 1790 under Captain George Wilson. Wilson commanded her for just over a year before she was paid off in September 1791.
French Revolutionary wars.
"Inconstant" returned to Woolwich and was fitted out again between January and February 1793 at a cost of £7,239. She was recommissioned under Captain Augustus Montgomery and joined the fleet under Richard Howe. She sailed to the West Indies in April, and captured the 14-gun "Curieux" there on 3 June 1793.
"Inconstant" returned to England in July that year, sailing again in November bound for Toulon to join Samuel Hood's fleet. She was briefly commanded by Captain George Cockburn in 1794, but he was succeeded by Thomas Fremantle in January 1795. Under Fremantle, and as part of the fleet under Admiral William Hotham, she fought against the 80-gun "Ça Ira" on 10 March 1795. The "Ça Ira"’s massive superiority in firepower soon forced Fremantle to fall back. As he did so, HMS "Agamemnon", commanded by Captain Horatio Nelson, surged past to continue the fight. This was a prelude to the Naval Battle of Genoa, fought over the next few days.
On 25 March "Inconstant" recaptured from the French, and went on to form part of Nelson's squadron in August. On 20 April 1796 she captured the French "Unité". The "Unité" was taken into service as . "Inconstant" was then present at the evacuation of Leghorn on 26 June 1796. After an active period in the Mediterranean, she was paid off in September 1797. She was refitted at Woolwich between March and June 1798, returning to service as a 20-gun troopship. She was commanded by Commander Milham Ponsonby until being paid off in October 1799, after which she was refitted and recommissioned as a fifth rate under Commander John Ayscough. "Inconstant" was initially operating in the North Sea, before receiving orders to move to support operations in Egypt in 1801. Because "Inconstant" served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp "Egypt" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants.
She came under the command of Captain Richard Byron in October 1802, but by December was under Captain Edward Dickson.
Napoleonic Wars.
"Inconstant" was fitted out as a troopship again in late 1803, and was present at the capture of Gorée in March 1804. She was restored as a frigate between 1805 and 1806, and spent the period between 1806 and 1808 as the flagship of Vice-Admiral James Saumarez. A large repair was carried out between 1808 and 1809, after which she sailed to the Cape of Good Hope. She was paid off in 1810, and refitted at Portsmouth. She recommissioned again in October that year, under the command of Captain John Quilliam, but by December command had passed to Captain Edward Owen. Owen remained in command until 1812, being succeeded by Sir Edward Tucker. Tucker sailed "Inconstant" to South America, and in August 1815 she was serving as Captain James Lucas Yeo's flagship.
Fate.
HMS "Inconstant" was finally broken up at Portsmouth in November 1817.

Jahvid Best

Jahvid Andre Best (born January 30, 1989) is a former American football running back in the National Football League. He was selected by the Detroit Lions with the 30th pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. In college, he played for the California Golden Bears, setting several records, including most all-purpose yards in a single season and most rushing yards in a single game for Cal. Best also led the Pac-10 in total rushing yards in 2008.
High school career.
Jahvid Best attended Salesian High School in Richmond, California, where he played for the Salesian Pride high school football team. In his junior year in 2005 he had 1,495 rushing yards on 138 attempts with 20 touchdowns as Salesian won the North Coast Section championship to conclude a 12–1 season. In his senior year, Best ran for 3,325 yards and 48 touchdowns, both Bay Area single-season records. Salesian once again made it to the NCS finals, but lost in the final game to St. Patrick-St. Vincent High School of Vallejo. Best received scholarship offers from Arizona, Arizona State, California, Michigan, Notre Dame, Oregon, USC, and Washington among others, before ultimately committing to California in 2006.
Track and field.
Best ran track as well, participating in the Arcadia Invitational in his junior and senior years. As a junior, he won the 100 meter dash with a time of 10.36 seconds with an injured foot. At the 2006 CIF California State Meet, he finished third in the 200 metres behind Bryshon Nellum and Devin Mays. As a senior he won the Arcadia Invitational 200 meter dash with a time of 21.40 seconds. Also during his senior year, Best won the CIF California State Meet 100 meters with a discounted wind assisted (2.4 m/s) time of 10.31, ahead of Charles Saseun and Randall Carroll. In the 200 metres, Best was runner-up (20.65) to Nellum (20.43), both far ahead of the competition. Best finished his senior season with personal bests of 10.31 and 20.65, the 5th and 2nd fastest times in the nation respectively.
College career.
Best received scholarship offers from Arizona, Arizona State, California, Michigan, Notre Dame, Oregon, USC, and Washington among others, before ultimately committing to California in 2006.
2007.
As a true freshman in 2007, Best was the primary backup to Justin Forsett. On only 29 carries, Best had 221 rushing yards, and 2 touchdowns. Best also caught 13 passes for 174 yards and a receiving touchdown. Best was selected as the team's Most Valuable Freshman as well as the team's J. Scott Duncan Award (Most Valuable Special Teams Player).
2008.
Best quickly got the nation's attention in the season opener against Michigan State on August 30. Best had 111 yards on 24 carries including a touchdown. His breakout game came on September 6 in a 66-3 Cal win against Washington State, having two touchdown runs of 80 and 86 yards, respectively. Best finished the game with exactly 200 yards and 3 rushing touchdowns.
Best struggled the following week against Maryland. This was mostly due to California falling behind early, therefore limiting Best's touches, due to a change in game plan by the Bears. Although he returned to form against Colorado State, he dislocated his elbow and would miss the next game against Arizona State. He returned for the Arizona game, and dashed for a 67 yard score that put the Bears ahead in the second quarter. He would rack up 140 all purpose yards against the Wildcats.
After two more impressive outings against UCLA and Oregon, where he averaged over six yards per carry, Best was held to only 30 yards against the USC Trojans. Following a 201-yard rushing game against the Stanford Cardinal in the 2008 Big Game on 19 carries, Best became the seventh consecutive 1,000 rusher for Cal since Jeff Tedford became head coach in 2002. During the last game of the regular season versus Washington on December 6, Best became the first Cal player to rush for over 300 yards in a game and ended the regular season as the Pac-10's leading rusher, beating out Oregon State's Jacquizz Rodgers.
A 186-yard, two touchdown performance in the 2008 Emerald Bowl earned him Offensive MVP honors for the game. Best finished the 2008 season with 1,580 rushing yards, an 8.1-yard per carry average, and 15 touchdowns.
2009.
On January 15, 2009 Best underwent surgery to tighten a ligament that had been injured when he dislocated his left elbow against Colorado State on September 27, 2008. This was followed up by foot surgery on January 23 to relieve irritation that was caused when Best bruised his foot halfway through the 2008 season. He missed spring football practice as a result. Best was named as the most explosive player in college football by Rivals.com in February 2009. In early June Best was able to participate in team summer workouts without pain. Entering his junior year, Best's breakout sophomore year caused early speculation of him being a future Heisman candidate and top running back prospect.
In Cal's season opener against Maryland, Best rushed for 137 yards and had two rushing touchdowns in the Bears' 52-13 victory. On September 12 against Eastern Washington, he rushed for 144 yards and one touchdown, and had one 22 yard receiving touchdown. On September 19 against Minnesota he ran for 131 yards and all of Cal's five touchdowns in the victory, a personal best and a modern school record. He was named Pac-10 Player of the Week and Rivals.com National Player of the Week. However, the next week Best was held to 55 rushing yards and no touchdowns on 16 carries against the Oregon Ducks. The following week he was held to 48 yards on 15 carries against the #7 Trojans, also unable to find the end zone. On October 17, Best recorded both his longest run and longest reception against UCLA in California's 45-26 victory over the Bruins.
Best was injured during the second quarter of Cal's November 7 matchup against Oregon State. In the process of scoring a rushing touchdown, he hurdled a defender into the end zone and was accidentally pushed by a second Oregon State defender in mid-air, causing him to land on the back of his head with his helmet coming off. The play resulted in a concussion for Best. After a 13-minute game delay, Best was taken off the field on a stretcher to the Highland General Hospital in Oakland. This was his second concussion in two weeks, following a mild concussion received the previous week against Arizona State. He was released the next day. and did not play the following week's game against Arizona, although he appeared as an honorary team captain. Best would miss the rest of the regular season. On December 16, head coach Jeff Tedford announced that Best would not play in the 2009 Poinsettia Bowl, stating that "'to get him back in game-ready form I don't feel like that's something that we can get done to have him ready to play.'" Best announced on January 2, 2010 that he would forego his senior year and enter the NFL draft.
Professional career.
2010 NFL Draft.
At the NFL Scouting Combine, Best tied for the sixth fastest overall 40 yard dash time and was the fastest among running backs. He was selected in a pick trade from the Minnesota Vikings by the Detroit Lions 30th overall in the 2010 NFL Draft. Regarding the pick, Lions head coach Jim Schwartz said, "Some people watch adult videos on their computer... I go to YouTube and watch Jahvid Best highlight clips. That’s what gets "me" going."
Detroit Lions.
2010 season.
Best signed a five year, $9.8 million contract with the Lions on July 30.
Best started 15 games, scoring his first career NFL rushing touchdowns in the regular season opener on September 12 against the Chicago Bears. His best game of the season came the following week in a 35-32 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, where he had 78 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and 154 receiving yards, including a 75-yard touchdown reception. He had more limited production for the rest of the season mainly due to a turf toe injury, with a career-low 2 rushing yards in Week 11 against the Dallas Cowboys, and did not score any further rushing touchdowns, although he had a 53-yard receiving touchdown against the Miami Dolphins in Week 16 during the Lions' four-game winning streak.
2011 season.
Best suffered a concussion on his second carry in the Lions third pre-season game of the season on August 19, a 30-28 win versus the Cleveland Browns. On Monday Night Football on October 10 against the Chicago Bears, Best had his first 100-yard game, rushing for 163 yards and a career long 88-yard touchdown run. During the second half of the Lions 25-19 loss to San Francisco on October 16, Best suffered another concussion, the last game (pre- or regular season) Best has played in the NFL. On November 25, Best was placed on IR due to post concussion symptoms.
2012 season.
On November 3, 2012, Best was placed on injured reserve due to continuing post-concussion issues, ending his season without playing in any pre- or regular season games.
As of late November, 2012, Best has been undergoing 'cognitive therapy' to treat his 'post-concussive symptoms', hoping to return to the field for the 2013 season.
2013 season.
On July 17, 2013, Best was released by the Lions. His health problems, due to his numerous concussions, disabled him from making it back to the field at any time during the 2012 season. Due to the inactivity of the 2012 season, Best was released.

1942 college football season

In 1942, Georgia Bulldogs were the consensus national champions, defeating UCLA in the Rose Bowl on January 1st, 1943. Ohio State was crowned #1 in the final AP Poll at the end of November, but did not make a bowl appearance. At the time, the AP poll did not put out a post-bowl poll. 
In 1942, as many as 156 sportswriters participated in the AP poll (which did not take into account bowl games). Each writer listed his choice for the top ten teams, and points were tallied based on 10 for first place, 9 for second, etc., and the AP then ranked the twenty teams with the highest number of points. 
The United States had entered the World War II, and able-bodied men of college age had volunteered for, or been drafted into, the armed forces. “Service teams,” many of which had former collegiate or professional players who had entered the Army or the Navy, played games against the college programs. In 1942, teams were fielded by Georgia Pre-Flight, the Great Lakes Naval Station, Iowa Pre-Flight, Jacksonville NAS, and St. Mary’s Preflight.
