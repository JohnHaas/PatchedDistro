Free-for-All (Michael Penn album)

Free-for-All was singer-songwriter Michael Penn's second full-length record, released in 1992 on RCA. There were no big hit singles of the strength of his only top 40 hit, 1989's "No Myth", but the album did feature two songs that reached the Top 20 on the Modern Rock Charts: "Long Way Down (Look What the Cat Drug In)" peaked at number 14, while the second single, "Seen the Doctor", reached nine spots higher, for a number 5 placing. The album led to a bitter battle between Penn and his record company, leading him to forgo releasing a follow-up until 1997.
Reception.
In his review for allmusic, reviewer Stewart Mason gave the recording 4 and a half stars (out of a possible five). He said that it was the record which proved to critics that Penn was no one-hit wonder, calling "Long Way Down" a "dark and pained opening to an album that was hardly pop-star material."

Edward Meeks &quot;Pope&quot; Gregory

Edward Meeks "Pope" Gregory (1922–1995) was an Episcopal priest in Richmond, Virginia. Reverend Meeks held the first gay marriage ceremony in Virginia at St. Peter's Church in Richmond in August 1978.
Biography.
Edward Meeks Gregory was born the fifth of seven children of Constance Adela (née Heath) Gregory (1890–1982) and George Craghead Gregory (1887–1956) at "Granite Hall", the family estate in northwestern Chesterfield County, Virginia, on September 30, 1922.

He became an Episcopal priest in Richmond, Virginia. He served Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia; Christchurch School in Christ Church, Virginia; St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Richmond, Virginia; and lastly, St. Peter's Episcopal Church also in Richmond. During the era of Massive Resistance and the desegregation crisis post-Brown v.

He conducted the first gay marriage ceremony in Virginia at St. Peter's Church in Richmond in August 1978. In 1979, while serving on Richmond'’s Human Relations Commission, Gregory became a big proponent, albeit unsuccessfully, of adding sexual orientation to the city code's nondiscrimination policies. He served as president of the Richmond-Petersburg Council on Human Relations and the Richmond Area Council on Human Relations. Gregory also helped found the Daily Planet, which services the needs of the homeless, and was the clerical advisor and member of the Richmond branch of Dignity/Integrity, the lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual caucuses of the Roman Catholic and Episcopal Church in the United States.
He died in 1995. His tombstone in Richmond’s Hollywood Cemetery bears the Latin inscription, “Pontificeamus,” or in English, “Let us build bridges.”

Massimo Polidoro

Massimo Polidoro is an Italian psychologist, writer, journalist, television personality, and the co-founder and executive director of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CICAP).
Early life and career.
Fascinated as a child in the 1970s by magic and by the hype surrounding claims of psychic phenomena, Polidoro learned in his teens about the work of James Randi and CSICOP through a TV series and a book by Piero Angela investigating parapsychology from a critical, skeptical point of view. He wrote to both Randi and Angela and was invited to a meeting in Rome in 1988.
Angela and Randi agreed that Polidoro, though still very young, appeared to have the talent and the passion to become a good apprentice of Randi. With a grant from Angela, Massimo left for the United States and became Randi's only full-time apprentice in the art of paranormal investigation and psychic testing.
After a couple of years, in which he helped Randi in his investigations, research, writings and lectures all over the world, Polidoro returned to Italy in 1990 where he started CICAP. He later studied psychology, and graduated from the University of Padua with a master thesis on the psychology of eyewitness testimony of anomalous phenomena.
CICAP and CSI.
Polidoro became the Executive Director of CICAP, and the editor of its journal, "Scienza & Paranormale". In 1996 he became the European representative for the James Randi Educational Foundation. In 2001 he became a member of the European Council of Skeptical Organisations (ECSO), and was nominated as a research fellow of CSICOP, the Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now Committee for Skeptical Inquiry). When Martin Gardner left his regular column "Notes from a Fringe Watcher" in "The Skeptical Inquirer", the magazine of CSICOP, Polidoro was asked to take over, and the column was retitled "Notes on a Strange World".
Polidoro continued to investigate and test alleged psychics, astrologers, clairvoyants, dowsers, mediums, prophets, psychic detectives, psychic healers, psychic photographers, telepaths and many others. He has conducted historical investigations on famous cases and personalities of the past, including Eusapia Palladino, Margery and his childood hero Houdini. Some of this work is collected in his books, two of which, "Final Séance" and "Secrets of the Psychics", have been published in America by Prometheus Books.
Polidoro's passion for magic led him to start a new magazine, "Magia", devoted to the study of the history, the science and the psychology of conjuring.
In 2005 he became the first Italian to hold, at the Psychology Faculty of the University of Milan Bicocca, a course on "Scientific Method, Pseudoscience and Anomalistic psychology".
TV.
Polidoro is the host, special guest, author or consultant of many TV shows, both in Italy and abroad. His latest international series, "Legend Detectives", devoted to the investigation of famous European legends, including Dracula, Robin Hood, the Pied Piper, Rennes-le-Château, the Blood of Saint Januarius and the Man in the Iron Mask, was broadcast on Discovery Channel.
In 2006 he created a podcast in Italian titled "I Misteri di Massimo Polidoro", dealing with investigation of mysterious subjects both by himself and by other colleagues that participate to the show.
In print.
As a journalist, Polidoro is a contributor to the monthly Italian magazine "Focus". He is the author of over 30 books in Italian (some of them have been translated abroad as well), dealing with many subjects related to mysteries, the paranormal and historical enigmas: from a critical history of Spiritualism to a dictionary of Parapsychology, from the wreck of the RMS Titanic to a biography of Houdini, from famous unsolved crimes of the past to the legends related to the strange deaths of celebrities. In 2006 he published his first novel, "Il profeta del Reich" (The Prophet of the Reich), a thriller loosely inspired by the life of magician Erik Jan Hanussen.
In the Summer of 2007 Italian newspaper "La Repubblica", which is one of the larger circulation in Italy for daily general-interest newspapers, reprinted six of Massimo's books in a series that was sold in newsstands along with the many local issues of the newspaper.
"Final Séance" (2001) deals with the strange friendship between Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, their friendly exchanges first and then the quarrels over their opposing views of Spiritualism.
"Secrets of the Psychics" (2003) is a collection of investigations done by Massimo on psychic phenomena, including tests of psychics, poltergeists, miracles and other strange phenomena.
Both books are published by Prometheus Books, and have been translated into many languages.

<doc id="19631610" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19631610" title="Club Life (TV series)">
Club Life (TV series)

Club Life is a series developed by Producer Jamie Hall, and is broadcast on citytv for Canada. Club Life premiered on June 7, 2008 with season 2 expected to air Nationally in June 2010. Season one was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
The show is about, as the title suggests, life in the night clubs. The first season focused on club etiquette. Topics ranged from fashion and drunk indicators to "How to be a VIP" and "How to treat a bartender". The show was a ratings success which has led to Season two which will be shot in Las Vegas and will help Canadians navigate Las Vegas nightlife.
Production.
Originally, "Club Life" was supposed to be a small segment presentation on the cable network Shaw TV. The management at Shaw decided that "Club Life" would force them to change the formula of their programming around "Club Life" so nixed the idea. In 2007, Jamie Hall approached Citytv Winnipeg about a half hour program. It was decided that Club Life would be more risque than originally developed and would centralize around sexually charged etiquette as well as humorous and sometimes embarrassing moments in night clubs. This was never more prevalent than in the Season one recap episode [http://crackle.com/c/Reality/Club_Life_Season_1_Episode_8/2363164#ml=fi%3d%26fu%3d2386864].
Hall assembled a team which included his assistant Kayla Tremblay and camera man his Shaw series, Def 11 which aired years earlier named Mitch Olsen. The team concluded that the show would feature one club per episode and would be developed around segments which included girls and guys questions as well as pickup lines.
Hall knew there was a challenge with such a show. The challenge was getting people to actually watch it This is why the show was accompanied by events and a massive online campaign featuring many previews on YouTube, crackle and Facebook. The show began production in May with Tila Tequila being featured on the series premiere [http://www.accesswinnipeg.com/2008/06/tila-tequila-interview-on-club-life-canada.
Filming.
The show is produced at Lex Kent Productions Studios in Winnipeg. Season one was filmed in Winnipeg. Season two is being filmed in Las Vegas. Winnipeg was selected because of its varied night club formats which the city is known for across Canada. The show was taped at mybar a Canad Inns night club, Blush Ultraclub [http://crackle.com/c/Reality/Club_Life_Season_1_Episode_2/2362664#ml=fi%3d%26fu%3d2386864, Alive in the District [http://crackle.com/c/Reality/Club_Life_Season_1_Episode_9/2362597#ml=fi%3d%26fu%3d2386864, Coyotes Night Club The Palomino Club [http://crackle.com/c/Reality/Club_Life_Season_1_Episode_5/2362922#ml=fi%3d%26fu%3d2386864, Whiskey Dix [http://crackle.com/c/Reality/Club_Life_Season_1_Episode_6/2362982#ml=fi%3d%26fu%3d2386864] and Houston's Roadhouse.
The behind the scenes special was taped at Teleco, a Rogers Wireless sales location. All shooting was on location. In season two producers have said they will be doing some green screen studio work and segway shots on location as well as outside of the clubs.
Cast.
Jamie Hall, who produces "Club Life" is also the host of the show and is sometimes known on-air as JamCo. His onscreen presence is meant to be noninvasive and unassuming. He doesn't get particularly sexual with guests and maintains a happy demeanor.
Bettina Pogson is the newest addition to the cast as co-host. You will often see Mitch Olsen panning down her sexy outfits. Bettina is new to TV but already feels natural in front of the camera.
Mandy Hogaboam plays the role of the sexy Production Assistant. She is the back bone of the behind the scenes production and is usually responsible for the guests that are on air.
Mitch Olsen, also known as Mitch The-Camera Olsen plays the over the top and crazy camera guy who often gets drunk and grabs the "special bits" of guests. His tone is sexual but at the same time humorous. In episode 5 of Season 1, Mitch became a camera regular with his segment "The Mitch Slap" that took a blunt look at what was happening in the club that night.

<doc id="19631729" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19631729" title="Barnyard Dawg">
Barnyard Dawg

(The) Barnyard Dawg (also known as George P. Dog) is a "Looney Tunes" character. An adult anthropomorphic basset hound, he is the archenemy of Foghorn Leghorn. He was created by Robert McKimson, who also created Foghorn, and was voiced by Mel Blanc. Dawg also feuds with other enemies as well like Henery Hawk, the Weasel, Daffy Duck and Sylvester.
Biography.
Dawg's first appearance came in "Walky Talky Hawky" (1946), the same Henery Hawk cartoon in which Foghorn himself first appeared. Although, in that cartoon, Dawg initiates hostilities with Foghorn by dropping a watermelon on his head (prompting Foghorn to grumble "Every day, it's the same thing!"), Dawg is usually seen sleeping in his kennel at a cartoon's beginning, with Foghorn provoking him by slapping his hindquarters with a wooden fencepost, setting the stage for Dawg to seek vengeance, often by manipulating Henery Hawk.
Dawg, called "Mandrake," was cast as pet to Porky Pig in 1947's "One Meat Brawl", where the pair pursue one-shot star Grover Groundhog, who gives the hunting dog a sob story ("Wife and 72 children!...No coal in the cellar...!") that has him weeping sympathetic tears, much to Porky's disgust. Dawg/Mandrake uses this ploy himself in 1949's "Daffy Duck Hunt", where, still Porky's pet and hunting companion, he persuades Daffy Duck to play along at being captured so he can avoid punishment from Porky, promising to free the duck later. However, once Daffy is tucked into Porky's freezer, Mandrake goes back on the bargain, although Daffy has little trouble outwitting both him and Porky.
In 1958's "Don't Axe Me", Dawg, now the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Fudd and renamed "Wover," again matches wits with Daffy after convincing Mrs. Fudd to designate the duck as Sunday dinner; surprisingly, Daffy is the loser in this cartoon, although he escapes doom when a guest requests a vegetarian meal instead. In 1958's "Gopher Broke", Dawg is the subject of "psychological wearing down" by the Goofy Gophers, Mac and Tosh, who are trying to get their vegetables back. After the gophers initiate phase no. 4 of their plan, which leaves Dawg on top of a telephone pole, he flips out and flies off (literally) after a crow, causing a deadpan pig, who's been witnessing the aftermath of the gophers' abuse against Dawg, to also flip out. While the pig has gone to see an animal psychiatrist, the doctor sees Dawg fly by his window and also flips out enough to join the pig on the couch.
Henery mistakes Dawg for a chicken in "The Foghorn Leghorn", because his father told him that chickens are great big monsters with real huge teeth who live in caves. Henery notices Dawg's mouth and presumes Dawg's doghouse is a kind of cave.
Although Dawg is normally portrayed as the straight man for Foghorn's pranks, in "Mother Was a Rooster", he is portrayed in a very negative light, as he not only steals an ostrich egg (he justifies this by explaining that it's been kind of dull round the farm lately, giving reference to his four year peace between him and Foghorn between "Weasel While You Work" and "Mother Was a Rooster"), he mocks the hatched ostrich, which Foghorn has adopted, and cheats in a boxing match with the rooster. 
Dawg also appeared in "Space Jam" as a member of the Tune Squad who is in the member not being injured, and in "" playing cards with other dogs in Yosemite Sam's casino. In "Baby Looney Tunes", Dawg appears as a puppy who chases the cool roosters, until Foghorn Leghorn shows the cool roosters how to deal with dogs (through a game of fetch), and instead of joining them, just befriends Dawg.
Barnyard Dawg first appeared in "The Looney Tunes Show" episode "Fish and Visitor's" Merrie Melodie's segment, "Chickenhawk" singing voice by Ben Falcone. He had a brief cameo at the end of the segment where it was shown that he sang the song the whole time. He later appeared in "Reunion's" Merrie Melodie's segment, "Cock of the Walk." In "Father Figures," Barnyard Dawg made a cameo as the umpire in the Father/Son Tennis Tournament final between Bugs and Walter Bunny against Daffy Duck and Foghorn Leghorn.
Voice.
Originally voiced by Mel Blanc, Barnyard Dawg through the years has also been voiced by Joe Alaskey, Frank Welker, Greg Burson, and Maurice LaMarche.

Jamie Hall

Jamie Hall is a Canadian author as well as nighclub promoter and television producer/host. Not limited to the field of entertainment, Jamie has also worked in the political arena on 
the campaign teams for Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz and US President Barack Obama.
Biography.
Jamie Hall was born in Grand Prairie, Alberta, Canada. He graduated from St. James Collegiate in 1999 and with a degree in Business for the University of Winnipeg Continuing Education as well as the Canadian Youth Business Foundation School of Business. Later he sat on the board of the Canadian Youth Business Foundation. His background in business has led to his ownership and management of several companies.
Jamie's first love was music. He started out as a DJ and then moved into promotions. He then owned a record label called Urbnrg Records which was distributed by Sunshine Records. The label was known for the events it promoted, a TV show called Def 11 which was produced for Shaw TV, the DJ Fin-S Live Video Mix Show and the World Record Attempt by 12seven rapper The Hafrican. Citing the internet as having a destructive power over the industry, Jamie sold his record label and worked on teen promotions full-time under the company name Feel Tha Heat Entertainment [http://www.fthentertainment.com].
During the time that Jamie owned Feel Tha Heat he was the face of the company and hosted some of Winnipeg's biggest shows sans celebrity attendees. Feel Tha Heat was sponsored by MTS and Rogers [http://rogers.ca. His time owning FTH Entertainment lasted only 4 years until he decided to move into TV full-time when his concept show Club Life was picked up by Citytv. Jamie sold FTH Entertainment during the summer of 2008 and moved to Las Vegas to produce Season 2 of Club Life.
While in Las Vegas Jamie began volunteering for the Barack Obama campaign. He worked on every aspect of the campaign that he could from canvassing to event and press coordination. In a shocking move Jamie gave up the taping of Club Life Season 2 to volunteer at Barack Obama's Inauguration. With both happening at the same time a decision had to be made and Jamie was cited as saying that he couldn't pass up working history and only Club Life could be revisited. Much of his involvement with the campaign was documented in a portfolio video here [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuSB7qkhwCM].
Since his time on the US campaign trail Jamie has continued to work in nightlife, opening Mystique Area [http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150296366785433 and being involved in the launch of Opera.
In February 2012 Jamie released his first novel entitled 7 Deadly Women The full story about how the novel came about was covered by CTV [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UWRyuya8yM. The book has since gone on to tell largely in the Winnipeg market and modestly in the US and overseas. Jamie has blogged [http://jamieianhall.wordpress.com/] about many subjects including that he is writing his next novel currently.
Television.
Jamie Hall is a television producer and host. He was first seen on Winnipeg TV for Shaw Cable in 2001 when he hosted and produced a cable access show called Def 11. The show featured a look at hip hop in Winnipeg and often featured guests as well as club nights. His second project was also for Shaw TV called Dance 204. Jamie was the co-host and producer. His third show, Club Life (TV series) was false National on Citytv and was seen late night. The show featured a look inside the world of Winnipeg nightlife. Most recently Jamie has produced a pilot called The Winnipeg Show [http://www.projectsbyjamie.com/jamiehall/the_winnipeg_show.html#!thewinnipegshow/c9qb].
Promotions.
While Jamie has worn many hats and can be seen as a jack of many trades he has been a promoter for the longest span of time. Jamie started by throwing small events at a local legion then quickly moved on to large events. He has promoted everything from foam parties to elegant New Year's Eve events, record labels to politicians. Jamie's expansive career in promotions landed him the title of Director of Nightclub Promotions for Canad Inns. He was let go from the company in 2011.

Media.
Jamie is also known to Winnipeg residents for his battle with the media and Mayor Sam Katz in February and March 2008 The battle was over whether or not any incidents involving weapons and drug use took place at a FTH event [http://mikeoncrime.com/article/7062/mayor-embarrassed-by-nightclub-event in February 2008 at the Sonar Club. One youth was detained by FTH security and later arrested by city police for hiding a machete outside the club. The Mayor pulled his endorsement of FTH and was blasted by Hall for having no backbone and as Hall was quoted as saying in the Winnipeg Sun "not waiting to examine the facts before speaking out against a positive force in teen's lives in Winnipeg." One of the nightclub owners was quoted in the Winnipeg Sun as having removed a teen for cocaine use. Hall claimed the entire media frenzy was brought on without fact or investigation and offered video evidence and testimonials from parents and teens to back up his side of the story. [http://winnipegfreepress.com/local/story/4128660p-4722242c.html] Sonar Nightclub later closed its doors and Hall dropped a lawsuit against the owners due to a corporate bankruptcy. After the event Feel Tha Heat went on to host several successful shows including a huge concert featuring Girlicious.
Hall worked on Mayor Sam Katz's campaign team during both of his campaigns in 2006 and 2004.
FTH also came under fire in March 2007 when the Winnipeg Convention Centre and Jamie Hall decided not to let a teen perform at an event after being tipped by the Police that gangs were going to "rush the security" in an effort to hurt the teen. Jamie and FTH were later praised for their decision to keep 2,500 youth safe. Hall is quoted on the FTH Entertainment website [http://www.fthentertainment.com] as saying this about the incident, "Cody's mom called me, asking for her son to perform at my event. We later learned of a mixtape he made calling out gangs which led to them wanting to hurt him. We put the safety of thousands of teens before a small performance at our preparty."
FTH was criticized on these occasions, however the company did host 4 years of sold out events, graduations, provide scholarships and grad dress programs for povern youth. During the duration of Hall's ownership of FTH, there were zero injuries, deaths and/or incidents that could be cited as major.
Politics.
Jamie Hall worked on two Mayoral campaigns for the current Mayor of Winnipeg Sam Katz. He also volunteered with the Nevada campaign team for Barack Obama as a press and event coordinator During a Michelle Obama rally Jamie Hall blogged his reasons for being a part of a USA election and gave a behind the scenes look to his Canadian peers [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqnB0Xbbpq4.

Euro-Populars for San Marino

The Euro-Populars for San Marino (, EPS) was a Christian democratic political party in San Marino. 
It emerged in September 2007 as a split from the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS). It held 5 seats out of 60 in the Grand and General Council prior to the elections from its time as part of the PDCS. For the 2008 general election the first elections the Euro-Populars for San Marino competed in, the party was part of the Pact for San Marino coalition and had its candidates in the list of the PDCS. The electoral coalition won 35 seats out of 60 in the Grand and General Council in the Sammarinese parliamentary election, 2008 gaining 54.22% of the national vote and a governmental majority of 5, becoming the new government of San Marino. The Euro-Populars for San Marino itself gained a few seats and a small percentage of the national vote as part of the coalition.
On 4 March 2011, the party merged with the Centre Democrats (DdC) to form the Union for the Republic.

Arengo and Freedom (, AL) was a liberal and social liberal political party in San Marino.
It was founded in September 2008 by two splinters from the Party of Socialists and Democrats, Fabio Berardi and Nadia Ottaviani, both members of the Grand and General Council, who considered the party to be too leftist. The group is linked to the Italian Circles of Freedom. For the 2008 general election, the sole elections Arengo and Freedom have competed in, the party was part of the Pact for San Marino coalition and had its candidates in the list of the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS).

Drag reducing agent

Drag reducing agents are additives in pipelines that reduce turbulence in a pipe. Usually used in petroleum pipelines, they increase the pipeline capacity by reducing turbulence and therefore allowing the oil to flow more efficiently.
Description.
Drag reducing agents have been present in society for over 20 years. These agents are made out of high molecular weight polymers. The polymers help with drag reduction by decreasing turbulence in the oil lines. This allows for oil to be pumped through at lower pressures, saving energy and money. Although these drag reducing agents are mostly used in oil lines, there is research being done to see how helpful polymers could be in reducing drag in veins and arteries.
How it works.
Using just a few parts per million of the drag reducer helps to reduce the turbulence inside the pipe. Because the oil pushes up against the inside wall of the pipe, the pipe pushes the oil back down causing a swirling of turbulence to occur. When the polymer is added, it interacts with the oil and the wall to help reduce the contact of the oil with the wall.
Degradation can occur on the polymers during the flow. Because of the pressure and temperature on the polymers, it is easier to break them down. Because of this, the drag reducing agent is reinjected after things like pumps and turns, where the pressure and temperature can be extra high.
Knowing what will create the ideal drag reducer is key in this process. Ideal molecules have a high molecular weight, shear degradation resistance, are quick to dissolve in whatever is in the pipe, and have low degradation in heat, light, chemicals, and biological areas. 
With drag reduction, there are many factors which play a role in how well the drag is reduced. A main factor in this is temperature. With a higher temperature, the drag reducing agent is easier to degrade. At a low temperature the drag reducing agent will tend to cluster together. This problem can be solved easier than degradation though, by adding another chemical, such as aluminum to help lower the drag reducing agent's attraction to one another. Another factor is the pipe diameter. With a decreasing pipe diameter, the drag reduction is increased. Going along with this, the roughness of the inside of the pipe has a factor. The rougher the inside, the higher the percent drag reduction occurring. Increasing the pressure in a pipe will help with drag reduction as well, but often that pressure is greater than what the pipe can withstand.
Areas of use.
Drag reducers can work in a couple of different fields. The most popular are crude oil, refined products and non-potable water. Currently there are several studies with ongoing tests in rats looking to see if drag reducers can help with blood flow.
History.
Drag reducers were invented more than 30 years ago by Conoco Inc. (now Phillips 66). Its use has allowed pipeline systems to greatly increase in traditional capacity and extended the life of existing systems. The higher flow rates possible on long pipelines have also increased the potential for surge on older systems not previously designed for high velocities.

Phineas Lovett

Phineas Lovett (May 15, 1745 – June 17, 1828) was a farmer, merchant, judge and political figure in Nova Scotia. He represented Annapolis County from 1774 to 1783 and from 1808 to 1811 and Annapolis township from 1799 to 1806 in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.
He was born in Massachusetts, the son of Phineas Lovett and Beulah Morse, and came to Nova Scotia with his family during the 1760s. He married Abigail Thayer in 1768. Lovett settled in Annapolis County. He owned a ship which traded in the West Indies. Lovett was high sheriff for the county, justice of the peace and lieutenant-colonel in the militia. In 1783, his seat in the provincial assembly was declared vacant due to non-attendance. He was elected to the provincial assembly for Annapolis County a second time in 1808 following the death of Henry Rutherford. In 1810, he was named a justice in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. He died at Annapolis Royal at the age of 83.
His son James Russell Lovett also served in the assembly.

Femi Fani-Kayode

David Oluwafemi (meaning "the beloved of the Lord") Adewunmi Abdulateef Fani-Kayode is a Nigerian politician, essayist, poet and lawyer. He was a member of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He is now with the opposition's All Progressive Congress (APC). He was born in Lagos, Nigeria, on 16 October 1960 to Chief Victor Babaremilekun Adetokunboh Fani-Kayode and to Chief (Mrs) Adia Adunni Fani-Kayode. He is an Ile-Ife chieftain of Yoruba descent.
Fani-Kayode was the Special Assistant (Public Affairs) to President Olusegun Obasanjo from July 2003 until June 2006. He was appointed the Minister of Culture and Tourism of the Federal Republic of Nigeria from 22 June to 7 November 2006 and as the Minister of Aviation from 7 November 2006 to 29 May 2007.
Background and education.
Femi Fani-Kayode comes from a prominent political and legal family in Nigeria. His great grandfather, the Rev. Emmanuel Adedapo Kayode, was one of the earliest Nigerians to be educated in England having obtained an MA from the University of Durham, after which he became an Anglican priest. His grandfather, Victor Adedapo Kayode, studied law at Cambridge University and later became a lawyer and a judge. His father Victor Babaremilekun Adetokunboh Fani-Kayode, who was also at Cambridge was a prominent lawyer and political figure in Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s: he was Leader of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons Opposition in the Western House of Assembly from 1960 to 1963, the Hon. Minister of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs and Deputy Premier of the Western Region of Nigeria from 1963 until 1966 and he successfully moved the motion for Nigeria's independence in 1958 in the Nigerian Parliament.
Femi Fani-Kayode started his primary school education at the age of 8 at Brighton College, Brighton in the U.K. after which he went to Holmewood House School in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, South-East England. After prep school he gained entry into Harrow School in Harrow on the Hill, United Kingdom and later on into Kelly College in Tavistock, U.K., where he completed the rest of his public school education. In 1980 Femi Fani-Kayode proceeded to the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies where he graduated with an LL.B law degree in 1983. He gained entry into Cambridge University (Pembroke College) where his grandfather (Selwyn College), his father (Downing College) and his older brother, Akinola (Downing College) had all previously read law. Victor Adedapo Kayode, Femi's grandfather, was called to the British bar (Middle Temple) in 1922 and his father, Remi Fani-Kayode, was called to the British bar (Middle Temple) in 1945. After finishing from Cambridge Femi Fani-Kayode went to the Nigerian Law School and in 1985 was called to the Nigerian Bar. In 1993, under the tutelage of Archbishop Nicholas Duncan-Williams of Ghana, Femi Fani-Kayode became a Pentecostal Christian. He decided to go back to school to study theology at the Christian Action Faith Bible Seminary in Accra, Ghana, gaining a diploma in theology in 1995.
Political career.
Femi Fani-Kayode was a member of the Nigerian National Congress (NNC) in 1989. He was elected the national youth leader of NNC that same year. In 1990, he was appointed as Chief Press Secretary to Chief Tom Ikimi, the first national chairman of the National Republican Convention (NRC) and in 1991 as Special Assistant to Alhaji Umaru Shinkafi, former head of the Nigerian Security Organisation (NSO). In 1996, disturbed by the actions of Gen. Sani Abacha’s military junta, Femi Fani-Kayode left Nigeria and joined the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) abroad where, together with the likes of the Oxford University-trained lawyer Chief Tunde Edu and others, he played a very active role in the fight against Abacha. He came back to Nigeria in 2001 and met President Olusegun Obasanjo. At the beginning of 2003, Femi Fani-Kayode was appointed by the President as a member of his presidential campaign team for the 2003 presidential election. After President Obasanjo won that election Femi Fani-Kayode was appointed as the first ever Special Assistant on Public Affairs to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In 2006 he was appointed as the Honourable Minister of Culture and Tourism. That same year, after a minor cabinet reshuffle, he was redeployed to the Aviation Ministry as the Honourable Minister of Aviation. Since the end of the tenure of President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration on 29 May 2007, Femi Fani-Kayode has gone back to the private sector and to his legal practice.
Challenges and Allegations.
Femi Fani-Kayode was investigated and arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in July 2008 in connection with the alleged misappropriation of a 19.5 billion naira (approx.US$300,000,000) "Aviation Intervention Fund" but the investigation was eventually closed and the charges were later dropped for lack of evidence of any wrongdoing on his part. Again the Senate Committee on Aviation in early 2008, investigating the allegations of misappropiation of the same Aviation Intervention Fund initially recommended that Fani-Kayode be banned from holding public office for five years but subsequently withdrew that recommendation when it became clear that he was not amongst those that misappropriated any public funds. In June 2007 he was reported to have had an affair with one of his former aides, Miss Chioma Anasoh who was arrested by Nigerian customs agents on suspicion of attempting to illegally launder US$240,000 via Abuja airport. Fani-Kayode allegedly arrived at the scene and facilitated her release. Anasoh later denied that her arrest had ever taken place, and also sued the newspaper that alleged that she did so for libel at the Lagos High Court. Fani-Kayode also denied the claim that he went to the airport to facilitate the release of Chioma Anasoh and he also said that she was never caught or arrested at the airport with US$240,000 or any other amount.
Fani-Kayode was again arrested on December 2008 by the EFCC and was charged with 47 counts of money laundering. These charges had nothing to do with the Aviation Intervention Fund but rather with some lodgements in his private bank account. Fani-Kayode stated that he was innocent and that the lodgements were funds that accrued from his own private businesses and legitimate sources and had nothing to do with government funds. He alleged that the investigations of the Yar'Adua government and the EFCC were politically motivated, and that he was being persecuted in the same way as other colleagues from the Obasanjo government, such as Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai and Nuhu Ribadu, for their ties to President Obasanjo.
At the beginning of 2010 due to President Yar'Adua's chronic ill health coupled with his prolonged absence from Nigeria without anyone hearing a word from him or knowing what was really wrong with him, there were speculations that a power struggle had begun in Nigeria with President Obasanjo and his loyalists pushing for Yar'Adua to step down and hand over power to his Vice President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan. Yar'Adua's loyalists resisted this suggestion vehemently and it was reported that part of their response to that challenge was to implement yet another strategy to try to silence and intimidate President Obasanjo and his key loyalists like El-Rufai, Fani-Kayode, Ribadu, Lawal Batagarawa, Nnenadi Usman and Andy Uba by roping them into a phantom coup plot with a view to eventually charging them and trying them for treason and encouraging military insurrection. This was the same method that was adopted by General Sani Abacha who had jailed Obasanjo on similar trumped up charges when he was in power. General Obasanjo was released and pardoned a number of years later after Abacha died and after General Abdulsalami Abubakar took power.
In November 2010, Fani-Kayode alleged that Yar'Adua's intention before he died was to jail and destroy the legacy of his predecessor in office and the man that single-handedly brought him to power, President Olusegun Obasanjo, together with those that were perceived as being his loyalists, including El-Rufai, Ribadu, and Fani-Kayode himself. He also alleged that Baba Gana Kingibe, the Secretary to the Federal Government during the Yar'Adua administration, was the principal enforcer of that plan and that Yar'Adua administration officials James Ibori, Tanimu Yakubu, Abba Ruma and Michael Aondoakaa were also involved.
Poems and essays.
In November 2009, before Yar'Adua fell ill, Fani-Kayode wrote a poem titled "I Stand and I Fight". In this poem, he described Yar'Adua as a "sickly tyrant with an amalekite foundation" and he predicted that "his end would soon come". Fani-Kayode wrote other poems over the last few years.
In January 2010 and approximately two months after Yar'Adua left Nigeria and was flown to Saudi Arabia on medical grounds (during which time no Nigerian other than his wife and his chief security officer saw him or saw any pictures of him), there were strong speculations in the country that the president was dead, was in a deep coma or was simply so sick that he could not even speak or get up from his sick bed in his Saudi Arabian hospital. This resulted in a power vacuum in Nigeria as a consequence of which a constitutional crisis began to unfold. The President's supporters and cabinet ministers, led by his wife Turai Yar'Adua, resisted the suggestion that the Vice President should take over power whilst the President was incapacitated even though this was what the Nigerian constitution prescribed, Fani-Kayode added his voice to that of President Obasanjo, President Shehu Shagari, General Yakubu Gowon, Ernest Shonekan and other former heads of government, former cabinet ministers, former legislators, leading opposition figures and leading members of the ruling PDP party by publicly calling for the resignation of President Yaradua and for the transference of power to Vice President Goodluck Jonathan at that critical time. In order to convey his view Fani-Kayode wrote a satire in "Next Newspaper" and titled it "Corpsology: Umaru's Gift To The Modern World". In the article Fani-Kayode suggested that by insisting on ruling Nigeria from his sick bed in Saudi Arabia and through his acolytes and wife, the President and his supporters were not just breaching the Nigerian constitution but that they were also surreptitiously introducing an entirely new and alien system of government into Nigeria, destroying democracy and attempting to perpetuate themselves in power through that new system indefinitely. He argued that this was being done by the authorities even where it was clear that the President was already "half dead". Fani-Kayode defined his concept of corpsology (or "corpsocracy" as he sometimes calls it) as "the rulership of the living by the dead" and the thrust and intent of his satire was to clearly convey the message that the attempt to introduce this hitherto unknown system of government into Nigeria by Yaradua, his wife and his kitchen cabinet was unacceptable and must not be allowed to stand.
Fani-Kayode was also involved in a debate about the mysterious circumstances under which Nigeria's first Prime Minister, Sir Tafawa Balewa, lost his life. In two essays titled "Femi Fani-Kayode: Who Killed Sir Tafawa Balewa?" and "The Death of Tafawa Balewa: the Segun Osoba angle", he opposed the view that Balewa had died of natural causes which had been suggested by Chief M.T. Mbu, Nigeria's former Foreign Minister and Chief Segun Osoba, a former state governor, and he proffered the view that the Prime Minister had actually been murdered. Fani-Kayode wrote other essays over the years. In 2011 he called for the "crushing" of the Islamic fundamentalist sect called Boko Haram which claimed responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of Nigerians in a campaign of terror and bombing in their quest to ban western education and set up an Islamic fundamentalist caliphate in the whole of northern Nigeria".
Family.
Femi Fani-Kayode has been married three times. His first marriage was to Saratu "Baby" Atta in 1987 but they were divorced by 1990. They have one daughter whose name is Oluwafolake. The second marriage was to Yemisi Olasunbo Adeniji in 1991 but they were divorced by 1995. They have three daughters whose names are Oluwatemitope, Oluwatobiloba and Oluwatuminu. The third marriage was to Regina Patience Amonoo. They were married in 1997 and are still married till today. They have one daughter whose name is Oluwaremilekun. His brother, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, was a renowned and influential artist and photographer who founded of the Association of Black Photographers (AUTOGRAPH) and who passed on in 1989.
David Oluwafemi Adewunmi Abdulateef Fani-Kayode ( Femi Fani-kayode), ' Described the Igbos, an ethnic group in Nigeria of more than 40 million people as "collectively unlettered, uncouth, uncultured, unrestrained and crude in all their ways". He has defended his views strongly.

John Audelay

John Audelay or Awdelay (died c.1426) was a priest and poet from Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire; he is one of the few English poets of the period whose name is known to us. Some of the first Christmas carols recorded in English appear among his works.
Biography.
The little that is known to us about Audelay's life comes mainly from the manuscript MS. Douce 302 (now in the Bodleian Library). The manuscript also contains the text of all sixty-two of his surviving poems.
The dialect of Middle English used in MS. Douce 302 is local to Staffordshire, and it has been suggested that Audelay may therefore have come from the Staffordshire village of Audley. However, the earliest biographical record of Audelay places him in London in 1417, when he was part of the household of Lord Richard Lestrange, 7th Baron Strange of Knockin. Lestrange was made to do public penance for his involvement in a brawl at St Dunstan-in-the-East church on Easter Sunday in which a parishioner was killed, and was accompanied on his penance by Audelay, his chaplain. It has been suggested that the penitential character of Audelay's poetry may have been influenced by his desire to atone for his involvement in Lestrange's public shame: as the family's chaplain he would have felt particular responsibility.
According to a date noted in MS. Douce 302, by 1426 Audelay was in effective retirement as a chantry priest at Haughmond Abbey. In lines repeated several times throughout the manuscript, Audelay states that he was by that time very old, infirm, deaf, and blind. The manuscript concludes with the following lines of rather rough verse, perhaps composed by the scribe after Audelay's death:
It is therefore possible that the manuscript either represents a collection of Audelay's poems assembled on his orders at the end of his life or that it was dictated by him.
Works.
Much of Audelay's work as contained in MS. Douce 302 consists of devotional carols (one of which, "There is a flower", has been set to music by both John Rutter and Stanley Vann): Audelay is recognised as a significant figure in the history of the English carol. He occasionally takes on more secular themes, such as in a spirited poem in praise of Henry VI, and in a piece titled "Cantalena de puericia", writes of the innocence of childhood, wishing he were a child again:
Much of Audelay's poetry is concerned with the theme of repentance; he seems to have had a particular fondness for Saint Winifred, a local saint who was credited with both the power to free criminals from their shackles (perhaps significant in view of Audelay's possible feelings of guilt over Lestrange's transgression) and the power to cure blindness. Audelay also appears to have been strongly concerned with the exposure of priests to accusations of heresy, and particularly of Lollardy, in the wake of Archbishop Thomas Arundel's "Constitutions": he directs an untitled satirical dialogue (usually known as "Marcol and Salamon") against certain aspects of the church hierarchy, incorporating references to the great satirical poem "Piers Plowman".
The two most remarkable and accomplished poems in the manuscript are both long exercises in a late form of alliterative verse with a superimposed rhyme-scheme: "Pater Noster" and "The Three Dead Kings". Some modern commentators have suggested that these poems cannot be by Audelay, as they show a very high level of technical skill not immediately apparent in other poems in the manuscript, but others have maintained that they were most probably Audelay's own work.

Joseph Aplin

Joseph Aplin (ca 1740 – April 26, 1804) was a lawyer and political figure in Nova Scotia. He represented Barrington township in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1785 to 1787.
He was born in Rhode Island, the son of John Aplin, and became a lawyer like his father, setting up practice in Newport. As a loyalist, he was forced to move to New York City and went to Nova Scotia in 1783. In 1787, he went to St. John's Island (later Prince Edward Island) as solicitor general for Edmund Fanning. In 1790, he was named attorney general. Aplin was charged with wrongdoing by supporters of former governor Walter Patterson in 1791; he was exonerated and successfully sued for damages in 1793. In 1798, after becoming associated with a group advocating that the island rejoin Nova Scotia, he resigned from the island's Council and was dismissed as attorney general. After unsuccessfully attempting to clear his name in England, he returned to Annapolis Royal where he resumed his law practice. Aplin is believed to have died in Rhode Island.

William Tate (painter)

William Tate (1747 – 2 June 1806) was an English portrait painter who was a student of Joseph Wright of Derby.
Life.
Tate was born in 1747 probably at Gawber Hall, near Barnsley, where his father was a glass maker and was christened on 14 November in Darton near Barnsley He was educated at Woolton near Liverpool where his brother Richard Tate lived and had Joseph Wright of Derby as his lodger in 1769. Richard was an amateur painter and was well connected. William Tate then became Wright's student.
It was with Joseph Wright in 1772 that William Tate first exhibited at the Society of Artists in London where he became a fellow. Over the next twenty years Tate exhibited in Manchester (1773), Liverpool (1774–1787) and London (1778–1787) at the Royal Academy of Art. Both Tate and Joseph Wright quarrelled with the Academy of Art which cannot have assisted Tate's career. In LIverpool however he enjoyed good support and in 1784 his work was exhibited in Liverpool with the same prominence as Joshua Reynolds. In 1787 William Tate moved to Manchester where he enjoyed a number of good commissions for portraits. Daniel Daulby had himself and both of his wives painted by Tate. He moved south to Bath in 1804 where he died in 1806.
The Walker Art Gallery has a number of William Tate's portraits of notable men and women of the day including Daniel Daulby, and the sister of William Roscoe. There are also paintings of his nephew Thomas Moss Tate and his niece Elizabeth Williamson, wife of Joseph Williamson. There are twelve paintings in national collections in the UK including a portrait of Joseph Wright and "Girl and Boy with a Bladder" at Derby Museum and Art Gallery which also hosts the country's main collection of Joseph Wright paintings.

Veronica Scott

Veronica Scott (born November 19, 1986) is an American television personality, fashion designer, and entrepreneur. Scott is best known for being featured in the Current TV reality show "The Fuchsia Girls", which follows her personal and professional life as she pursues a career in the fashion industry. Scott also co-owns the fashion company and design house Fuchsia with business partner Lawren Pope.
Early life.
Scott was born in 1986 in Dallas, Texas to Johnnie Lee Scott Jr. and Rebecca Scott. Scott, who is multiracial, is of Hispanic and African American descent. She has one brother, Johnnie Lee Scott III, who is eight years younger than her. Scott attended River Oaks Elementary in Houston from kindergarten to the 5th grade.
Scott began college at private Houston Baptist University as an International Business major for three quarters. She then moved from Houston, Texas to San Diego, California and enrolled at the private University of San Diego School of Business Administration. Today Scott resides in San Diego with longtime friend and Fuchsia co-owner Lawren Pope.
Scott’s lack of art and design schooling has been somewhat of a controversy with a few fashion industry seniors. In a 2008 interview with fashion editor Elizabeth Stein, Scott notes that she has been somewhat "snubbed by certain members of the fashion industry, for not doing any time at a FIDM or Parsons."
Career.
Fuchsia.
According to Troy Anderson staff writer of Los Angeles Daily News and NBIZ Magazine, Scott has always known that she wanted to own a fashion retail business and even “expressed an interest in fashion design as early as age 6”. This interest led to the future collaboration with Pope, whom Scott met seven years later at Westside High School.
At age 14 Scott teamed up with Pope to open the fashion company Fuchsia. Six months later they released their first collection of ready-to-wear cocktail attire at a self produced runway show in Spring, Texas. Scott premiered the video footage of the fashion show on the Fuchsia official site, scoring the interest of several local media journalists. Most of Fuchsia’s early income and public interest can be attributed to this.
As webmaster of the Fuchsia online boutique, Scott has designed and created every released version to date, of the Fuchsia Official Site and E-shop located at www.FuchsiaOnline.com. Anderson, who profiled Scott for an article on E-Commerce noted that Scott actually prefers an internet store front to a physical boutique. Scott says that the online boutique works out great, "because we're still in college and we don't have to maintain a storefront 24/7."
Save The Girls.
In 2007 Scott co-founded the 501(c)(3) non-profit organization Save The Girls. Save The Girls provides cash scholarships, scholarship education and college application assistance to schools, groups, and individual students in need. In 2008 Scott took on the position of Chair at the organization.
Save The Girls also sponsors The Grace House in Chisinau, Moldova. In July 2008, Scott traveled on a mission trip for the first time to Moldova with the non-profit Justice and Mercy. It was during her visit to The Grace House – a transitional home for female graduates of the Internat Orphanage- that Scott requested emergency aid funds from Save the Girls to improve the poor living conditions of the girls living in the home. Upon return to the U.S. Scott successfully motioned to keep funding The Grace House as a Save the Girls project. Scott is currently producing a new web shop for the girls of The Grace House to sell handmade jewelry and clothing. All profits fund The Grace House project.

Françoise Barré-Sinoussi

Françoise Barré-Sinoussi (born 30 July 1947) is a French virologist and director of the Regulation of Retroviral Infections Division (Unité de Régulation des Infections Rétrovirales) at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France. Born in Paris, France, Barré-Sinoussi performed some of the fundamental work in the identification of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the cause of AIDS. In 2008, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with her former mentor, Luc Montagnier, for their discovery of HIV.
Academic career.
Barré-Sinoussi joined the Pasteur Institute in Paris in the early 1970s. She received her PhD in 1975 and interned at the U.S. National Institutes of Health before returning to the Pasteur Institute. Barré-Sinoussi's research quickly turned to a particular group of viruses, the retroviruses. Her knowledge in this field led her to discover in 1983. This discovery revealed an urgent need for diagnostic tests to aid in controlling the spread of the disease. Barré-Sinoussi started her own laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in 1988. 
Among Barré-Sinoussi's many recent research contributions are studies of various aspects of the adaptive immune response to viral infection,the role of innate immune defences of the host in controlling HIV/AIDS, factors involved in mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and characteristics that allow a small percentage of HIV-positive individuals, known as elite suppressors or controllers, to limit HIV replication without antiretroviral drug. She has co-authored over 240 scientific publications, has participated in over 250 international conferences, and has trained many young researchers.
Barré-Sinoussi has actively contributed to several scientific societies and committees at the Institut Pasteur as well as to other AIDS organizations, such as the National Agency for AIDS Research in France. She has also been implicated at an international level, notably as a consultant to the UNAIDS-HIV.
Since the 1980s, Barré-Sinoussi has initiated collaborations with developing countries whereby she has managed multidisciplinary networks with dedication. She constantly works on establishing permanent links between basic research and clinical research with the aim of achieving concrete improvements in the areas of prevention, clinical care, and treatment.
In 2009, she wrote an open letter to Pope Benedict XVI in protest over his statements that condoms are at best ineffective in the AIDS crisis.
In July 2012 Barré-Sinoussi became President of the International AIDS Society.
Awards.
Barré-Sinoussi shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Luc Montagnier for their co-discovery of HIV, and with Harald zur Hausen, who discovered the viral cause of cervical cancer that led to the development of the HPV vaccine. 
In addition to the Nobel Prize, Barré-Sinoussi has received awards including:
Barré-Sinoussi was named an Officer of the Legion of Honor|National Order of the Legion of Honour (Ordre national de la Légion d’honneur) in 2006 and was raised to Grand Officer in 2013.
She received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Tulane University in May 2009.

Aimata Dam

Aimata Dam (相俣ダム) is a dam built on the Akaya River, part of the class-A Tonegawa River system at Aimata in the city of Minami (the former village of Nīharimura), in the Tone District of Gunma Prefecture, Japan.
It is a gravity dam made of concrete, operated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism's Kantō Regional Development Bureau, built to a height of 67.0 metres. As a member of the upstream Tonegawa River dam cluster, it supplies water to Tokyo and the Japanese capital region. The dam's purposes are flood prevention at the point where the Akaya River merges with the Tonegawa River in the former city of Tsukiyono, and energy generation via the Gunma Prefecture-operated hydroelectricity facilities, making it a multi-purpose dam. The artificial Akaya Lake was created by the dam.
History.
In the wake of the massive damage sustained by the Tonegawa River system from 1947's Typhoon Kathleen, the Economic Stabilization Board's consultative flood prevention committee proposed the construction of a reservoir as the pillar of a cumulative plan for developing flood prevention infrastructure. The Ministry of Construction's Kantō Regional Development Bureau drafted the "Tonegawa River Repair and Improvement Plan" in response to this proposal; the plan was based on the construction of (originally) 9 multi-purpose dams on the Tonegawa River system. These eventually became the Tonegawa River 8 Dam Cluster, with one of the dams on the main Tonegawa River—Fujiwara Dam—being already under construction.
Preliminary studies for dam construction were begun on the Akaya River in 1948. Afterward, the dam project's operation was turned over to Gunma Prefecture, rebranded as the auxiliary "Akaya River Cumulative Project"; construction began in 1952, and completed in 1956. However, during initial impoundment (in which the dam is partially filled to test for abnormalities), leakage through the bedrock on the left bank was discovered, and Gunma Prefecture requested repairs from the Ministry of Construction. That same year, concrete work was started to enable seepage control on the left bank. Repairs were completed three years later in 1959, and construction was finalized. Aimata Dam was placed under the direct management of the Ministry of Construction, and became the second of the Tonegawa River 8 Dam Cluster.
Purpose.
Aimata Dam provides flood control from the Akaya River to the bank of the merged Tonegawa River, rated to cut a (1947) Typhoon Kathleen-level design flood of 650 tons per second to 330 tons per second (cutting 320 tons per second). It maintains customary water rights of 140 tons per second for irrigation water (with unspecified usage permissions) to the city of Kuki in Saitama Prefecture, and also creates energy via the Aimata electricity generation plant, with a permitted output of 7,300 kW, and the Momono electricity generation plant, with a permitted output of 6,200 kW. Afterward, the #2 Aimata electricity generation plant (120 kW) was added, to make use of the sustained effluent. Each generation plant is independently run at the prefectural level by the Gunma Prefecture Public Enterprise Bureau.
Currently, the dam functions as a valuable source of water for the capital region, and is controlled via the Tonegawa River Integrated Dam Group Operation Office in the city of Maebashi. The dam site itself is cut into a large "V" shape, and is fairly tall in proportion to its length.
Akaya Lake.
The famous Sarugakyou hot springs are located adjacent to the lake created by the dam—Akaya Lake. The hot spring facilities were originally located adjacent to the Akaya River, but submerged as a result of the dam's establishment, similar to Yanba Dam and the Kawarayu hot springs. However, in the case of Sarugakyou, the source of the hot spring was preserved, allowing for the development of a new hot spring resort area, and many hotels and inns sprung up around the shores of Akaya Lake, drawing numerous hot spring tourists to Gunma Prefecture.
Route 17, which passes nearby, is more commonly known as the Mikuni Kaidō highway, and drivers continuing along toward Niigata go through the Mikuni Touge mountain pass. This road historically linked the former Echigo province and the former Kouzuke province, and was used several times by the military commander Uesugi Kenshin to cross over to and attack Kantō during the Warring States period. Featuring attractions like the Minakami Hot Springs, Mount Tanigawa, and the city of Yuzawa's ski area, the area features several touristic points of interest.
In 2005, it was designated by the Water Resources Environment Engineering Center as one of Japan's "Selected 100 Dam Lakes" after recommendation from the city of Minami.
Kawafuru Dam Plan.
The population of the Capital region exploded after the completion of Aimata Dam; to meet demand, the Ministry of Construction and the Water Resources Development Organization (renamed as the Japan Water Agency) energetically continued development of the Tonegawa River system. However, in the 1980s, droughts had begun to occur at a rate of once every two-to-three years, accompanied by a lack of rainfall, both attributed to the effects of global warming. To secure enough water to meet demand, the Ministry of Construction implemented the "Emergency Water Supply-Countermeasure Dam Project" to retain water in reservoirs during droughts.
The Akaya River and Kawafuru Hot Springs upstream of Aimata Dam were singled out, and plans were brought forth for the newer "Kawafuru Dam" on the Akaya River. The concrete gravity dam was to be built at Kawafuru to a height of 131.0 meters, with flood control storage of 46,000,000 tons of water, appropriating water to municipal and industrial water systems and helping to alleviate water shortages in the Capital region.
A construction feasibility study was carried out in 1990, after which the initial plans were altered to increase the height of the dam to 160.0 meters and the flood control storage to 76,000,000 tons. However, water demand from the Capital region continued to increase, and as public projects at the time were all being put under review, the dam project was scheduled for further reevaluation. Water demand eventually shrank, and as the necessity of Kawafuru Dam was called into question the construction project was put on hold for an indefinite period of time.

Marketing performance measurement and management

Marketing performance measurement and management (MPM) is a term used by marketing professionals to describe the analysis and improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing. This is accomplished by focus on the alignment of marketing activities, strategies, and metrics with business goals. It involves the creation of a metrics framework to monitor marketing performance, and then develop and utilize marketing dashboards to manage marketing performance.
Performance management is one of the key processes applied to business operations such as manufacturing, logistics, and product development. The goals of performance management are to achieve key outcomes and objectives to optimize individual, group, or organizational performance. MPM however, is more specific. It focuses on measuring, managing, and analyzing marketing performance to maximize effectiveness and optimize the return of investment (ROI) of marketing. Three elements play a critical role in managing marketing performance—data, analytics, and metrics.
Data and analytics.
One of the core methodologies to measure marketing effectiveness is the collection of appropriate data. The gathering of right types of data, and its accuracy, is crucial in measuring the marketing performance. Agreement between the marketing department and the senior management is important in selecting appropriate data to be collected.
While data collection is relatively simple, a thorough analysis to make sense of collected data is critical. By thoroughly analyzing the data, organizations can gather actionable business insights to improve the marketing effectiveness and marketing efficiency. For example, organizations can use the analytics to drive the marketing return on investment, and make faster and better business decisions.
One common use of these analytics is optimizing marketing spending by using market mix models--models that measure the impact of marketing activities, competitive effects, and market environment on sales of a product. The consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry extensively uses this method, and it is now being adopted elsewhere. For example, in Financial Services, Marketing Mix Modeling projects and tools will collect all marketing spend into a single database, and analyze spend's effects on acquisition of new customers, retention, average customer value, up-sell of additional services, and so on. These models use data to create a model that establishes the link between spend in various channels, geographies and so on with incremental sales. The concepts and tools of these Marketing Mix Models date back over 30 years - but more sophisticated techniques developed in the 1990s/2000s by such agencies as ATG, MindShare, Edge, and Brand Science, coupled with the explosion in the quantity and availability of marketing data, have brought MMM into the mainstream. With the increased usage of the Internet, social networking sites, mobile advertising, and text messaging, interest in them is increasing. 
Metrics and management.
Measurement and metrics enable marketing professionals to justify budgets based on returns and to drive organizational growth and innovation. As a result, marketers use these metrics and performance measurement as way to prove value and demonstrate the contribution of marketing to the organization.
Popular metrics used in analysis include activity-based metrics that involves numerical counting and reporting. For example, tracking downloads, Web site visitors, attendees at various events are types of activity-based metrics. However, they seldom link marketing to business outcomes. Instead, business outcomes such as market share, customer value, and new product adoption offer a better correlation. MPM focuses on measuring the aggregated effectiveness and efficiency of the marketing organization. Some common categories of these specific metrics include marketing's impact on share of preference, rate of customer acquisition, average order value, rate of new product and service adoptions, growth in customer buying frequency, volume and share of business, net advocacy and loyalty, rate of growth compared to competition and the market, margin, and customer engagement. In addition, MPM is used to measure the monitoring of operational efficiency and external performance.
Operations performance metrics is a term used when organizations manage marketing functions as a business. Organizations committed to implementing MPM may create positions such as marketing operations director and marketing finance director. Program-to-people ratios, awareness-to-demand ratios, the cost vs lead, the cost vs sale, and conversation rates are the typical data collected and analyzed. Operational performance metrics, however, primarily provide the organization with a way to rationalize marketing investments, but do not correlate marketing to business strategy and business performance.
MPM tightly focuses on these operating measures to help marketers view how efficiently resources of the organization such as people, facilities, and capital are used. External performance measures aligned with business outcomes assess things such as the value an organization provides to customers or the performance of an organization relative to its competitors.
By using a top-down approach, marketers develop metrics and specific performance targets known as key performance indicators (KPI). First business decisions are made to define the scope. To create metrics and KPIs, marketeers involved in MPM try to first brainstorm on the business outcome that they are trying to impact. This is followed by asking the opposite questions that need to be answered to determine if the questions have an impact on this outcome, and the necessary supporting data required to answer these questions. After determining what data is needed, marketeers need to search for this data, and determine the decisions and actions that must to be enforced as a result of this data mining.
Dashboard.
One way of displaying the performance measurements is with a dashboard. The dashboard is where all data and metrics are collated and presented as useful information for the organization. Marketing professionals create these dashboards from metrics and KPIs. Organizations can then use this information to proceed with their marketing. In essence, a dashboard is a multilayered performance management tool that enables organizations to measure, monitor and manage business activity by using both financial and non-financial measures. The dashboard provides analysis into the progress of the organization toward achieving each defined objectives.
A good dashboard consists of three layers:
An ideal dashboard should show the progress of marketing, help assess productive areas, and help in the decision making. In addition, dashboards provide an indication on the value of marketing and also helps to align marketing with the business.
Processes.
MPM professionals develop closed-loop business processes for data collection, performance target setting, measurement and reporting.
Processes must describe a document outlining the step-by-step actions that marketing must take to follow the process consistently. A valuable aid is the process map. Process mapping is a technique to create a clearly defined objective to meeting business results. It provides a systematic description of the actions taken by marketing personnel as they use a specific set of activities to produce a defined set of outcomes. It can also help identify skills the organization may need to implement the plan. In addition, an organization can use the process map to identify technology and training requirements. For organizations committed to implementing ISO 9001, process maps are an integral part of quality management.
The marketing metrics continuum provides a framework for how to categorize metrics from the tactical to strategic. By navigating this metrics continuum, from activity-based to predictive, marketers can move towards more effective marketing measurement and align measurement and metrics with business outcomes.
System and tools.
According to "Marketing Metrics in Action: Creating a Performance-Driven Marketing Organization", the creation of a performance-driven organization requires two elements: a set of standards and processes for identifying and accessing relevant data, and the ability to generate performance metrics from the data.
Management and skills.
A Forrester Research and Heidrick and Struggles study titled "The Evolved CMO", found that 20% of the 115 chief and senior marketing professionals needed a further understanding in marketing measurement, customer relationship management (CRM), and customer data analytics. Marketing professionals must be able to tap into customer information that enables them to provide a strategic guidance the organization requirements. This allows them to extend business into emerging markets and bring innovative products to market.
Marketing professionals can then assess how to measure the impact of marketing on the business and translate the metrics to simple charts, data, and figures that the top management of the organization (CEOs, CFOs, and other CxOs) can understand.
A United States-based study conducted by management consultants Bersin and Associates states that "today more than 40% of US corporations believe that 'driving a performance-based culture' is one of their top three talent strategies." Cultures that foster an environment of teamwork and employee development, and resource empowerment achieve higher quality outcomes. Similar to other optimization processes (for example a six sigma quality management program), MPM requires a culture of accountability within the organization. Without a disciplined approach, success of implementation of MPM to drive productivity would not yield tangible results.
Stakeholders.
Stakeholders for MPM implementation include the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and marketing operations professionals.
Marketing accountability of an organization lies with the CMO. CMOs are deeply involved with the MPM professionals to define marketing objectives, determine investments and prove the value of marketing in the organization. Marketing operations and analysis professionals are responsible for the creation of new metrics and processes to measure and improve operations performance. They are expected to evaluate and implement systems to improve marketing efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, they are faced with the challenges of collecting data and analytics essential to the development, and the deployment of marketing dashboards and creating the marketing operations road map. The chief financial officer of a company or public agency is the corporate officer primarily responsible for managing the financial risks of the business or agency. This officer is also responsible for financial planning and record-keeping, as well as financial reporting to higher management. As marketing is a crucial vertical of any organization, the CFO is an important stakeholder for any marketing and other finance-related tasks.

Bowman is the developer of ProGrid Evaluation Methodology. He is a recipient of a number of awards including the Order of Canada and the Global Energy Prize.
Bowman graduated in chemical engineering in 1952 and later completed his PhD in 1961. After working several decades for Imperial Oil Limited, and also holding executive positions with the Chemical Institute of Canada and the Canadian Research Management Association, Bowman started his own consultancy. He helped organizations use "ProGrid" to make a broad range of decisions such as selecting research projects, choosing corporate strategies, and making decisions on proposals, grant applications and awards.
Early life.
He is was born to Emily and Clement Willis Bowman Sr. on January 7, 1930 in Toronto, Ontario. His father was an émigré from England who settled in Ingersoll, Ontario. After high school, Bowman enrolled in the University of Toronto where he graduated as a chemical engineer in 1952.
Career.
After working several years with DuPont Canada on the production of nylon, Bowman returned to the University of Toronto in 1957 for postgraduate work. In 1958, he attained a MASc and then a PhD in 1961.
He then joined Imperial Oil Limited, an affiliate of Exxon Corporation, at the Esso Research Centre in Sarnia, Ontario.
In 1964, Imperial Oil selected him as one of the staff to test the process of bitumen separation on a variety of oil sands by taking the plant to the oil sands formation in Alberta. He worked for Syncrude Canada Limited for the next six years, conducting studies on the molecular and interfacial properties of the oils sands and the mechanism of the Clark hot water separation process., leading to a paper presented at the Seventh World Petroleum Congress in Mexico City in 1967.
In the late 1960s the government of Alberta decreased the rate of oil sands development, and Bowman returned to Imperial Oil's research department in Sarnia. He was later promoted to senior researcher at the Imperial Oil's Sarnia Research Centre.
In 1975, he was appointed the first chairperson of the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority (AOSTRA) by Alberta premier Peter Lougheed. AOSTRA is a crown corporation with a fund of $100 million (worth million today). He was responsible for starting a project to obtain access to the deep oil sands deposits by sinking a shaft and drilling horizontal wells by directional drilling, now the basis of the widely adopted method of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD).
In 1984, he returned to Imperial Oil as Vice President—Research for Esso Petroleum Canada, a division of the company, with responsibility for the Sarnia Research Centre. In 1986, he returned to Alberta as President of the Alberta Research Council, an Alberta crown corporation. At the Council, he led the organization into joint research ventures with the private sector, with the oil sands and their environmental issues remaining a priority. In 1989, five years after leaving AOSTRA, he received the K. A. Clark Distinguished Service Award for his contributions to AOSTRA. On completing his term there, he opened his own consulting practice.
Bowman was also a key adviser to Premier Lougheed on energy issues throughout the 1970s-1980s.
At 61, he was inspired by the work of Alex Lowey and Phil Hood in their book "The Power of the 2×2 Matrix" to devise a methodology, called "ProGrid", for practical decisions such as selecting research projects, choosing corporate strategies, and making decisions on proposals, grant applications and awards in a number of Canadian research institutions and Centres of Excellence, such as Alberta Heritage Foundation of Medical Research, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Centres of Excellence.
During the period 2005 to 2013, he chaired the Energy Pathways Task Force for the Canadian Academy of Engineering (CAE), which published four reports and one book and held four workshops presenting energy options for Canada. He received the CAE Distinguished Service award in 2007 for his work on the task force.
Recognition.
During his career, he held the office of President or Chairperson at the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering, the Chemical Institute of Canada, and the Canadian Research Management Association, In 1991, he received the Canadian Research Management Association's Medalist Award and the Alberta Science and Technology Leadership Award. He was a Member of the National Research Council and served on the Executive Committee of the Canadian Association for the World Petroleum Congresses. In 1993, he became an Honorary Fellow of the Chemical Institute of Canada, and in 1994 was installed as a Member of the Order of Canada.
The work with the Canadian Academy of Engineering, and his contributions to the Alberta Oil Sands during his career, resulted in his receipt of the Global Energy International Prize in 2008, awarded by Russian President Dmitri Medvedev.
In 2010, Western University named a $50 million national centre for technology commercialization, the Bowman Centre, after him. The Bowman Centre is housed at the university’s Western-Sarnia-Lambton Research Park campus.

IBM MTCS

MTCS (Minimum Teleprocessing Control System) was a transaction processor that ran on IBM mainframe systems under OS/VS1.
MTCS was available from IBM and designed for rapid, low to medium volume online processing. This process was entirely interactive (screen-oriented using 3270 display terminals).
The 'official' version of MTCS was single thread only and was a forerunner of CICS before it was released.
An unofficial and multi-threaded version of MTCS was developed by Littlewoods Pools, UK at the same time as a multi-threaded "MTCS bridge" (middleware MTCS simulator) became available for running MTCS transactions directly under CICS. This version was also used by other customers including Granada Productions under a license agreement.
Transactions.
An MTCS transaction is a set of operations which together perform a task. Usually, the majority of transactions are relatively simple tasks such as updating the balance of an account. 
MTCS applications comprise transactions which were written in IBM Basic Assembly Language and interfaced with 3270 terminals.
Each MTCS program was initiated using a transaction identifier. MTCS screens were sent as native 3270 datastreams to the terminal.
History.
The first release of MTCS was made available prior to the first release of CICS in the late 1960s.
A forerunner of MTCS was known as "FASTER" and was a higher level BTAM based product that controlled IBM 2260 display terminals

Hong Kong Arts Centre

Established in 1977, Hong Kong Arts Centre (HKAC) is a non-profit making, non-governmental and self-financed statutory arts organization, aiming at promoting contemporary performing arts, visual arts, film and video arts and providing arts education.
The centre provides presentation spaces and venues including galleries, theatres, a cinema, classrooms, studios and offices. In the centre, art lovers can experience Sculpture, Photography, Ceramics, Illustrations, and sound and visual installations.
History.
In the late 1960s, the City Hall was the only venue for contemporary arts in Hong Kong and there was a lack of space for art and cultural activities. In 1968, several art associations and groups wrote to the Hong Kong Government to request the grant of a piece of land on which to build an arts centre. S. F. Bailey, the Secretary General of the University Grants Committee, led the campaign. He obtained legal rights for the group in June 1971 and acquired a piece of reclaimed land near Gloucester Road in Wanchai from the government after years of negotiation.
When only half of the required $28 million had been raised construction was halted and unable to continue until Hong Kong Governor Sir Murray MacLehose applied for loans using a government warrant. Li Choh-ming, the first Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, was the first Chairman of the Arts Centre, Sir Run Run Shaw was the first Vice-chairman, and Neil Duncan was the first General Manager.
The Hong Kong Arts Centre was inaugurated by the Governor on 14 October 1977.

Edward Glover (psychoanalyst)

Edward George Glover (13 January 1888 – 16 August 1972) was a British psychoanalyst. He first studied medicine and surgery, and it was his elder brother, James Glover (1882–1926) who attracted him towards psychoanalysis. Both brothers were analyzed in Berlin by Karl Abraham; indeed, the 'list of Karl Abraham's analysands reads like a roster of psychoanalytic eminence: the leading English analysts Edward and James Glover' at the top. He then settled down in London where he became an influential member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society in 1921. He was also close to Ernest Jones.
Amongst Edward Glover's most lasting achievements in the combined field of psychotherapy and criminology - aside from his clinical work and extensive publications - are his roles as: co-founder of the Psychopathic Clinic (renamed the Portman Clinic in 1937) and the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Delinquency, joint founder of the British Journal of Criminology - he was co-editor until his death - and co-founder of the British Society of Criminology. He was one-time chairman of the medical section of the British Psychological Society. He is publicly remembered in the annual Glover lecture, delivered under the auspices of the Portman Clinic.
Early life.
Glover was the third son of a highly gifted country schoolmaster who was a professed Darwinian agnostic.
He suffered family tragedies throughout his life. His second brother died at the age of 6 when Edward was 4, and James, his much-admired elder brother, died in his 30s. Later in life his first wife died in childbirth along with their child. From his second marriage he had a daughter who suffered from Down’s Syndrome, whom Glover and his wife cared for at home for many years.
Glover entered the medical school in Glasgow at the age of 16 and graduated at 21 with distinction. It is reported that as a student he was prominent in socialist politics and was involved in a revolutionary move to propose Keir Hardie as rector of the university. There followed several years of academic medicine, working first in Glasgow with the professor of medicine and paediatrics and then in pulmonary medicine in London. With the outbreak of the First World War he was appointed medical superintendent of a sanatorium for the treatment of early chest diseases in Birmingham.
Early texts (1924-1939).
Between 1924 and 1939 Glover published his first book as well as some eighteen articles on psychoanalytic subjects ranging from "Notes on Oral Character" through "The Screening Function of Traumatic Memories" to "A Note on Idealisation".
'Glover once wrote a very interesting paper in which he investigated the ways in which incomplete or inexact interpretations, and also other psychotherapeutic procedures, influence the patient's mind...[as artificial substitute symptoms, which may make the spontaneous symptoms superfluous. Lacan would make use of Glover's findings to support his exploration of "The function and field of speech and language in psychoanalysis" on more than one occasion: 'Mr Edward Glover in a remarkable paper... not only is every spoken intervention received by the subject in terms of his structure, but the intervention takes on a structuring function in him in proprtion to its form'. Thus 'Glover...finds interpretation everywhere, being unable to stop it anywhere, even in the banality of a medical prescription'.
Glover's "Lectures on Technique in Psychoanalysis"(1927-8) would seem to have offered a dry, neutral, asceptic classical psychoanalysis. Thus on the question of whether analysis should close with a "cooling-off" period, he followed the classical line 'that "to the very end we continue the analytic process", as the English analyst Edward Glover wrote in "The Technique of Psychoanalysis", first published in 1928 and revised in 1955. Glover sternly continues, "In the first session we laid down the association rule, and this remains in force to the last minute of the last session2'. 
Similarly on the question of the early "deep interpretation" favoured for example by Melanie Klein, Glover argued: 'Once the analyst departs from sparing, provisional interpretations, he not only disturbs the listening situation but has made it difficult to re-establish it'.
Psychoanalytic controversies.
Glover was a combative intellectual personality who took a principled stand on many of the variegated controversies of the first psychoanalytic half-century, promoting a 'pure Freudianism'.
In the early 1920s, when Abraham 'feared that Ferenczi and, far worse, Rank, were caught in an act of "scientific regression". English psychoanalysts, notably Ernest Jones and the brothers Edward and James Glover, wholly agreed with Abraham'.
In the later 1920s, when Freud made something of a minority stand in support of Lay analysis, 'some of the British psychoanalysts, among them Edward Glover and John Rickman, saw no harm in nonmedical therapists conducting analysis, provided one kept therapy "sharply divided from diagnosis: the latter must be left to medically qualified persons"'.
Glover worked with Jones in the BMA in obtaining the so-called "Psycho-Analytical Charter" - 'Edward Glover and myself had for over three years fought at heavy odds against our twenty-five bitter opponents'.
In the thirties, Glover found himself increasingly opposed to the innovations and influence of Melanie Klein, who found 'from 1934 onwards, a hostility within the British Psycho-Analytic Society' led by 'Glover was scientific secretary of the British Society' - hostility which lasted for the best part of a decade until the 'vituperative opposition from Edward Glover and Melitta Schmideberg had vanished when Glover gave up his membership of the British Psycho-analytical Society in 1944'. At this point, Glover declared that 'The British Psycho-Analytical Society is no longer a Freudian society' and its 'deviation from psychoanalysis'; and the following year, the fundamental Kleinian position paper by Susan Sutherland Isaacs on "Phantasy" was publicly 'attacked by Glover (1945)', in the first volume of "The Psychoanalytic Study of the child", where he described what he called "the Klein System of Child Psychology" as 'a bio-religious system which depends on faith rather than science...a variant of the doctrine of Original Sin'.
In the following decade, Glover turned his fire from Klein to Jung: his book, '"Freud or Jung?" (1956) is a partisan Freudian--though defensible--polemic'. In it he argued (incidentally) for the firm conceptual separation of art and psychopathology. 'Glover put this view most trenchantly: "Whatever its original unconscious aim, the work of art represents a "forward" urge of the libido seeking to maintain its hold on the world of objects...not the result of a pathological breakdown'.
In the 1960s, Glover aroused the ire of Lacan by way of his attack on Franz Alexander's concept of the corrective emotional experience: 'When I read in the "Psychoanalytic Quarterly" an article like the one by Mr Edward Glover, entitled "Freudian or Neo-Freudian", directed entirely against the constructions of Mr Alexander, I sense a sordid smell of stuffiness...Alexander being counter-attacked in the name of obsolete criteria'.

<doc id="19632788" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19632788" title="System Prevalence">
System Prevalence

System prevalence is a simple software architectural pattern that combines system images (snapshots) and transaction journaling to provide speed, performance scalability, transparent persistence and transparent live mirroring of computer system state.
In a prevalent system, state is kept in memory in native format, all transactions are journaled and System images are regularly saved to disk.
System images and transaction journals can be stored in language-specific serialization format for speed or in XML format for cross-language portability.
The first usage of the term and generic, publicly available implementation of a system prevalence layer was Prevayler, written for Java by Klaus Wuestefeld in 2001.
Advantages.
Simply keeping system state in RAM in its normal, natural, language-specific format is orders of magnitude faster and more programmer-friendly than the multiple conversions that are needed when it is stored and retrieved from a DBMS.
As an example, Martin Fowler describes "The LMAX Architecture" with a transaction-journal and system-image (snapshot) based business system at its core, which can process 6 million transactions per second on a single thread.
Requirement.
A prevalent system needs enough memory to hold its entire state in RAM (the "prevalent hypothesis"). Prevalence advocates claim this is continuously alleviated by decreasing RAM prices, and the fact that many business databases are small enough already to fit in memory.
Programmers need skill in working with business state natively in RAM, rather than using explicit API calls for storage and queries for retrieval.
The system's events must be capturable for journaling.

Queensland Independent College

Queensland Independent College is a private, primary school in Merrimac, Gold Coast, Australia. It was founded in 2008 as the Queensland Montessori College, with a view to creating a sustainable school to replace a previous Montessori school that had closed down. The first intake of students occurred at the start of 2009.
The school is coeducational, non-denominational and emphasises specialised educational attention in a relaxed, supportive environment. It originally focused on the Montessori method of education, a child-centric method of teaching that focusses on independence, self-discipline and thinking skills, with light external control of the children. As the curriculum evolved it sought the same aims by including Dewey’s progressive education, integrated curriculum, Kolb’s VAK & experiential learning, Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences and Harvard University’s Teaching for Understanding, in order to "incorporate the positive aspects of each to fully engage all learners at all times." Currently it covers Montessori cycles 1 to 3 (Prep to Year 7: up to age 12).

Darlington &amp; Stockton Times

The Darlington & Stockton Times also known as the D&S Times is a regional weekly newspaper in North East England. The paper is based in Darlington, County Durham. 
The paper covers the market towns of Darlington and Stockton as well as surrounding areas.
History.
First published in Barnard Castle in 1847. It was the brainchild of Liberal philanthropist and barrister, George Brown, who sought to challenge the Tory monopoly of the press in the region.
The following year it relocated to Darlington, where it has continued to be published from to the present day. Founder George Brown then sold it to property developers, Robert and William Thompson. In 1864, the Thompsons went into liquidation and it was then sold to Henry King Spark. Spark purchased the paper to raise his own political profile in and around the Darlington area.
In 1867, the D&S Times was instrumental in both Darlington's Incorporation and its creation into a Parliamentary borough. But both campaigns brought the paper into conflict with local industrial barons, the Peases, who responded by creating "The Northern Echo". In 1878, following a decade of feuding between the two factions Spark was made bankrupt and was forced to sell the D&S Times to the Northern Echo proprietor John Hyslop Bell. 
In 1903, it was then sold to the North of England Newspaper Company, which later became part of the Westminster Press group.
In 1996, Newsquest Media Group bought the Westminster Press Group and its titles, including "The Northern Echo". Shortly after on 3 October 1997 it ditched the classified advertisements from the front page and replaced it with news, being one of the last newspapers in the UK to do so.
In 2009, the newspaper switched from its traditional broadsheet format to a smaller 'compact' layout, following in the footsteps of its sister title, The Northern Echo.

John Bull (gunman)

John Bull (1836 – 1929) was a little-known yet nonetheless deadly gunman of the American Old West. He is featured in the book ""Deadly Dozen"", written by author Robert K. DeArment as one of the twelve most underrated gunmen of the 19th century west.
Early life.
Born John Edwin Bull, in England, little more is known of his early life. It also is not certain as to when he ventured to the United States, but is believed to have been some time during the 1850s. He first appeared, in historical texts, in 1861, as a professional gambler that made his way around mining boomtowns. 
On August 25, 1862, he was involved in a gunfight while in the mining camp of Gold Creek, located in Montana Territory. He entered the town stating his name was John Bull, and that he and his companion, a man named Fox, were on the trail of horse thieves who had stolen six valuable horses in Elk City, Idaho. The thieves, C.W. Spillman, Bill Arnett, and B.F. Jermagin had preceded Bull and Fox in entering the camp by about three days. 
Bull and Fox captured Spillman with no incident, and placed him in the custody of several miners while the two continued to search for the others. Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull stepped inside with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men throw up their hands and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying on the table beside him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.
At this time mining camps in Nevada Territory were booming, most promionent Aurora, and then Austin. John Bull settled at the silver camp of Austin, in the center of the Territory. Early in 1864 there came about a nationalistic dispute over who was “chief” in Austin - Irish vs. English. In deference to the late editorial against dueling with pistols and knives, the use of those weapons was rejected by involved parties. It so happened another talent of Johnny Bull was fisticuffs. The issue was finally settled between Bull and a particular Irishman. They met up late at night on February 21, in a saloon at the corner of Main and Cedar Streets. Inside within the presence of an excited crowd, the two combatants (with their seconds) came to an agreement in regards the rules of pugilism to be allowed:
By 1865 Bull had partnered with Langford Peel, they moving together next to Belmont, Nevada. Post - Aug. 4, 1867
Life and reputation.
Bull was next heard of in 1866, when he arrived in Virginia City, Nevada. By this time he was partnered in a gambling operation with fellow Englishman Langford M. Peel, known as "Farmer" Peel, a former soldier. During this time, famed writer Mark Twain became friends with Bull, writing later of how well they had gotten along, and particularly of a joke that Bull had once pulled on Twain during the winter of 1866. 
Bull and Peel, by early 1867, had moved their operations on to Belmont, Nevada, and then to Salt Lake City, Utah. While in Salt Lake City, the two argued, and for a time separated. However by the summer of 1867 the two were working together again, by this time in Helena, Montana. On the night of July 22, 1867, Peel and Bull were seated at a table in the "Greer Brothers Exchange Saloon", and for some reason the argument they had previously had was rekindled. Both men jumped to their feet and became arguing loudly.
Peel slapped Bull in the face with one hand, and pulled his gun with the other. Bull raised his hands, stating "I am unarmed". Peel responded that he should go and arm himself, then return. Bull retreated to his room, quickly wrote down a makeshift will for the disposition of his property in the event of his death, then took his gun and returned to the saloon. 
By the time Bull had returned, Peel had left the saloon, and moved down the street to the "Chase Saloon", and was talking to his girlfriend, prostitute Belle Neil. Peel then escorted Neil, the two retiring to his room. As they walked outside onto Helena's Main Street, they were met by Bull. Immediately Peel went for his gun, as did Bull. Bull shot Peel with his first shot, and as Peel attempted to draw his own pistol, Belle Neil unintentionally, due to her shock, tugged at his arm hindering him from drawing. Bull fired again, with Peel falling face down into the street. Bull then walked up calmly, and fired a third round into Peel's head, killing him.
Town Marshal John Xavier "X" Beidler took Bull into custody. That night, a lynch mob gathered, intent on hanging Bull, but Beidler backed them down. In the trial that followed, the jury failed to convict, and Bull was released. He immediately left Helena, traveling to Cheyenne, Wyoming. Langford Peel had been known to have killed at least four men prior to Bull killing him, thus Bull was treated as a man with somewhat of a reputation since it was he that killed Peel. In fact, he was treated as somewhat of a celebrity while in Cheyenne. 
In 1868, now again in Utah, Bull married to a woman described as having been extremely pretty and lady like, but ill suited for his lifestyle. Bull thus moved with her to Chicago, Illinois, and there the two had two children. She died of illness in 1872, and Bull placed his children in foster homes. By the following year he was in Omaha, Nebraska, again operating as a gambler. 
Shortly before midnight, on July 12, 1873, while in the company of gambler George Mehaffy, Bull and Mehaffy stabbed railroad employee Samual Atwood outside the "Crystal Saloon" in Omaha, due to Atwood warning others that Bull was a crooked gambler running a crooked game. Town Marshal Gilbert Rustin gathered several policemen and went in search of the two men, locating Bull inside "Sullivan's Saloon". When Rustin approached him, Bull produced his pistol, refusing to be arrested, causing Rustin to withdraw. Bull then ran all the patrons out of the saloon, and calmly sat down in a chair, falling asleep. When awakened, he quietly submitted to arrest without resistance. 
Atwood was still alive, but in serious condition, thus a mob of supporters were threatening to hang Bull. Mehaffy by this point had also been captured, and both were being held in the local jail. Atwood, when interviewed, implicated Mehaffy as the one attacker he could identify, thus Bull was released. Mehaffy was later freed on bond following Atwood's recovery, and again began working with Bull in their gambling arrangement. Bull began to move around frequently through the small western towns of the day, often in the company of other gamblers, and often taking part in crooked games meant to heist money from unsuspecting amateur gamblers. He also began dabbling in professional boxing, as a promoter. 
In 1874 he and Mehaffy were arrested for armed robbery, citing that they had robbed a man named Wilkinson in a gin mill. In 1875 those charges were dropped, after Bull had gotten released on bond and jumped bail. Due to him having worn out his welcome in that area, Bull moved on to Deadwood, South Dakota in 1876, another boomtown. By 1879 he had settled in Denver, Colorado, and over the next few years his name appeared often in police reports, often being arrested for public drunkenness and disturbing the peace. While in "The Slaughterhouse" saloon, he was once arrested for disturbing the peace, at which point he resisted knocking one policeman unconscious with a walking stick, after which several other officers beat him into submission.
On the night of October 14, 1880, Bull, now partnered with gambler Jim Moon, became involved in an altercation with two city policemen. Moon's wife and another woman who had been dating Bull also became involved, throwing chinaware at the officers, causing them to retreat. Bull and Moon met the officers, who returned with more policemen, at the front door, pistols drawn, but after seeing that they could not win, both Bull and Moon surrendered. Less than a month later, Moon killed a man named Sam Hall by beating him on the head with his pistol. He was acquitted on the grounds of self defense in the trial that followed. Seven months later, Moon, a jealous man, attacked a gambler named Clay Wilson, believing Wilson was paying too much attention to his (Moon's) wife. Wilson shot Moon twice, killing him. 
Bull moved on to Denver, where, in January, 1882, gambler and associate Jim Bush shot Bull in the foot after an argument. Bull refused to press charges, and let the matter drop. Shortly afterward he again moved on. In 1898, he was in Spokane, Washington, and attended a show in the "Peoples Theater" with friend Frisky Barnett. As the two men walked out, Barnett for unknown reasons jammed his lit cigar into Bull's eye, which caused Bull to scream in pain, then draw his pistol. Barnett jumped behind a woman, and drew his own pistol. The two men began firing, both emptying their pistols. One of Bull's shots hit the woman, another took off one of Barnett's fingers. Bull had been shot four times, once in the neck, once in the groin, once in the chin and once in the left arm. 
The woman recovered, but Bull was forced to allow his arm to be amputated. Barnett was fined $10 for discharging a firearm in city limits, and released. Bull was expected to die, but hung on for several weeks. He recovered, still carrying a bullet in his neck. In 1921, when the bullet began to bother him, he had it removed in Excelsior Springs, Missouri. He died in 1929, at the age of 93.

After four consecutive losing seasons, the Giants finished 88–74. Following Peter Magowan's retirement, Bill Neukom served as general managing partner of the Giants. After a season with the fewest home runs of any team since the 1993 Florida Marlins, general manager Brian Sabean said the Giants would attempt to bring in a power hitter as well as strengthening a bullpen that held a 4.45 ERA in 2008, fourteenth in the National League.
After leading the National League Wild Card race for most of the season, the Giants were ultimately passed by the Colorado Rockies. The team finished third in the NL West and second in the Wild Card. Though they missed the playoffs, the Giants surpassed most expectations for their season; for example, "Sports Illustrated" projected that the Giants would finish with a record of 77–85. "Sports Illustrated"'s Lee Jenkins noted San Francisco's promising farm system (including products Pablo Sandoval and Madison Bumgarner) and the perceived weakness of the NL West as reasons to be optimistic about the Giants' potential. Additionally, the Giants' starting rotation boasted three Cy Young Award winners: Randy Johnson, Tim Lincecum, and Barry Zito. After the season ended, Lincecum won his second straight Cy Young. The Giants would build on their surprising 2009 season the following year, winning the World Series. It would be their first in San Francisco.

Ronimo Games

Ronimo Games is a Dutch video game developer founded in 2007 by former students of the Utrecht School of the Arts.
History.
The team that later formed Ronimo Games initially came together under the name of Banana Games, and created the original freeware PC version of "de Blob". Publisher THQ noticed the game, was very impressed with the team's work, and acquired the rights to the game. THQ subsequently handed over further development to Blue Tongue Entertainment (Nintendo DS, Wii) and Universomo (Mobile/iPhone/iPod).
With the money earned from selling the rights to "de Blob" the team founded Ronimo Games. The name "Ronimo" came from a brainstorming session in which the team decided to combine the first letters of the words "Robot Ninja Monkeys".
In May 2009, the studio released the WiiWare title "Swords & Soldiers". In September 2010 the game was released for PlayStation Network with publisher Sony Online Entertainment and in December the Windows and Mac version on Steam. In June 2011 the game was ported by Two Tribes and published by Chillingo for iOS.
Currently the studio is developing "Awesomenauts", a multiplayer online battle arena for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Despite the publisher's financial problems, the game was released on PC at May 2, 2012.

Yozakura Quartet

Yozakura Quartet is Suzuhito Yasuda's first manga. Before the creation of Yozakura Quartet, he was an illustrator. He drew the original character designs for Yoshikazu Kuwashima's series and Ryohgo Narita's Durarara!!.
Story.
The story revolves around four teenagers; Akina, Hime, Ao, and Kotoha; each of them having their own unique abilities. They run an office called Hiizumi Life Counseling Office, where their job is to help and protect the townspeople of Sakurashin, a town where humans and youkai co-exist. The town is protected by a barrier created by the spiritual sakura known as The Seven Pillars. The Seven Pillars exist in both the human world and the youkai world and is the only thing that keeps both worlds connected to each other. However, recent bizarre incidents have occurred in their town and someone has threatened its safety. It is up to the four of them to protect the town they love.
Media.
Manga.
In July 2004, Suzuhito Yasuda was supposed to illustrate a demon manga series with someone else scripting the story, but his editor suggested that he should create an original series. In January 2005, Yasuda came up with a series called Glorious Life, a prototype for Yozakura Quartet. It was set in Sakurashin just like Yozakura Quartet, however the editor-in-chief shot it down. His editor suggested three girls and a boy as the main characters and that they could be demon hunters for hire. His editor commented that he wanted to make something similar to Charlie's Angels, which in August 2005 turned out as Yozakura Falsetto. However this too was shot down by his editor. He was told that he had a last chance to fix the series and in October 2005, his story was finally accepted. His editor told him he should change the title of his series though because it was too hard for their readers to understand, and suggested Yozakura Quartet instead of Yozakura Falsetto. The series finally began serialization in January 2006. The manga was published in the United States and Canada by Del Rey Manga.
Anime.
An anime adaption of the manga had aired on TBS in October 2008. The anime was produced by Nomad. The anime has been licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks and 
is distributed by Section23 Films. The complete collection was released March 2, 2010.
On March 23, 2010, manga creator Suzuhito Yasuda announced that a new anime adaption that will start in October coinciding with the ninth volume of the manga. The cast from the first series returned for this series. The first OAV shipped on October 8. A second episode was released along with the 10th volume on April 8, 2011.
On April 4, 2013, it was announced that a manga-only OAD, Yozakura Quartet ~Tsuki ni Naku~, is in the works and will be released on September 9, 2013. On the same day, it was announced that Yozakura Quartet will get a new TV anime adaptation as well, animated by Tatsunoko Production.　On April 9, 2013, the title was confirmed as Yozakura Quartet ~Hana no Uta~. On April 11, 2013, it was confirmed that Yozakura Quartet ~Hana no Uta~ will feature the same cast as the first series, and will not be a continuation from the first series, but rather, a complete new series on its own.

Palace of Lausus

The Palace of Lausus or Lausos, also known as the Lauseion (), was a 5th-century building located in Constantinople that was acquired and owned by the eunuch Lausus.
Lausus.
Lausus, who had formerly served as a eunuch in the court of Theodosius II, became the imperial chamberlain sometime around 420. He was described in a letter by the bishop of Caesarea as being charitable to the poor, but also being very wealthy and owning a fine estate. Whilst he is reported to have lost his position as imperial chamberlain to Macrobius only two years after promotion, he may have regained the title ten years or so later following recommendation by Cyril of Alexandria, re-establishing his wealth.
Description of the palace.
The Palace of Lausus was renowned throughout Constantinople for the vast collection of heroic and mythological statues that its owner housed within its walls. Lausus amassed this huge collection from eastern temples that were being sacked and emptied during the reign of Theodosius – and, as such, his collection was likely the most diverse to have existed in Constantinople at the time. Lausus' collection of pagan statues was the first that was dispassionately assembled on purely aesthetic and historical grounds, even though he was reportedly a devout Christian. Foremost amongst his collection was the statue of Zeus from Olympia carved by Phidias in circa 500 BC and Praxiteles' Aphrodite of Cnidus. Lausus is also known to have owned the Hera of Samos and the Athena of Lindos, as well as statues of both Eros and Kairos. Reports indicate that Lausus had arranged his collection in a certain order. The aforementioned statue of Zeus was located in an apse at the far end of the hall, with Eros and Kairos at his side. One wall was dedicated to sculptures of goddesses, the other of animals.
The exact location of the Palace of Lausus in Constantinople is a matter of debate, although it is generally accepted that the Palace was connected to the western flank of the Hippodrome by a rotunda, and that it was adjacent to the Palace of Antiochos. It was also very close to the Mese, the central thoroughfare of Constantinople, that led from the Augustaeum to the Golden Gate. See the map on the right for a more detailed analysis.
Both Zonaras and Cedrenus report that the Palace of Lausus, along with much of the city, was destroyed by fire in 475. Lausus' entire collection was lost to the blaze.
The Palace's destruction occurred long after Lausus' death, which had transpired some thirty years earlier, around 436.
Today, the Cistern of Philoxenos is located beneath the site where the Palace of Lausus is commonly accepted to have stood. The ruins of the palace of Antiochos still remain on the site today, as does the rubble from the rotunda joining the Palace of Lausus to the Hippodrome.

<doc id="19633010" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19633010" title="Beneficial acclimation hypothesis">
Beneficial acclimation hypothesis

The Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis (BAH) is the physiological hypothesis that acclimating to a particular environment (usually thermal) provides an organism with advantages in that environment. First formally defined and tested by Armand Marie Leroi, Albert Bennett, and Richard Lenski in 1994, it has however been a central assumption in historical physiological work that acclimation is adaptive. Further refined by Raymond B. Huey and David Berrigan under the strong inference approach, the hypothesis has been falsified as a general rule by a series of multiple hypotheses experiments.
History and Definition.
Acclimation is a set of physiological responses that occurs during an individual’s lifetime to chronic laboratory-induced environmental conditions (in contrast to acclimatization). It is one component of adaptation. While physiologists have traditionally assumed that acclimation is beneficial (or explicitly defined it as such), criticism of the adaptationist program by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin led to a call for increased robustness in testing adaptationist hypotheses. 
The initial definition of the BAH, as published in 1994 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Leroi et al., is that “acclimation to a particular environment gives an organism a performance advantage in that environment over another organism that has not had the opportunity to acclimate to that particular environment.” This definition was further reworked in an article in American Zoologist 1999 by Raymond B. Huey, David Berrigan, George W. Gilchrist, and Jon C. Herron. They determined that, following Platt’s strong inference approach, multiple competing hypotheses were needed to properly assess beneficial acclimation (see picture at right). These included: 
1. Beneficial Acclimation. Acclimating to a particular environment confers fitness advantages in that environment.
2. Optimal Developmental Temperature. There is an ideal temperature to develop at so individuals reared at an optimal temperature compete better in all environments. 
3. Colder (bigger) Is Better. In ectotherms, individuals reared in colder environments tend to develop to a larger body size. These individuals therefore have a fitness advantage in all environments.
4. Warmer (smaller) Is Better. The inverse of Colder Is Better. Smaller individuals have a fitness advantage.
5. Developmental Buffering. Development temperature does not affect adult fitness.
Experimental Tests.
The majority of tests of the Beneficial Adaptation Hypothesis have, following Krogh's Principle, centered on the model organisms "Drosophila melanogaster" and "Escherichia coli". More specifically, experimental tests have centered on easily-measured temperature adaptation (although other systems have been studied; see ). Of the several experimental tests of the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis, most have rejected it as a universal rule (see reviews ).
Initial experiments by Leroi "et al.", the first scientists to address this problem, tested only the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis and not the subsequent hypotheses developed by Huey "et al." Colonies of "E. coli" were acclimated for seven generations in two different temperature conditions: 32 °C and 41.5 °C. Colonies were then competed against each other at those temperatures. He found that, agreeing with the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis, colonies acclimated at 32 °C competed better at 32 °C. However, at 41.5 °C, colonies acclimated at 32 °C competed better as well. This led to the authors’ rejection of the generality of beneficial acclimation.
Huey "et al." examined four previously-conducted studies, applying the five competing hypotheses, and found that none of the results of the studies could be entirely explained by beneficial acclimation. Instead, a combination of hypotheses were required to explain the observed patterns of acclimation.
Why Is Acclimation Not Beneficial?
While it seems intuitive that acclimation would provide benefits to individuals, the majority of empirical tests of the hypothesis have rejected its general appliction. Why then is acclimation not beneficial? H. Arthur Woods and Jon F. Harrison examined the possible reasons in a 2002 "Evolution" paper. They suggested that:
1. The timescale of adaptation is much longer than that of environmental variation.
2. Environmental cues for timing of adaptive acclimation are unreliable.
3. It may cost more to adapt than not to.
4. Migration by adjacent populations may swamp out genes for adaptive acclimation.
Criticism.
In response to continuing rejections of the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis, a number of common criticisms of experimental tests have been developed:
1. The majority of studies have actually been examining developmental acclimation. That is, rather than acclimating an adult individual and testing, they suggest that developmental switches triggered by particular temperatures result in a different mechanism of acclimation. More recently, it has been found that adult acclimation and developmental acclimation lead to support for different hypotheses.
2. Most studies have included stressful temperatures. Acclimation to those temperatures may decrease fitness in an individual.
3. Finally, a variety of traits are examined in these studies that may only be indirectly linked to fitness. For example, examining longevity as a fitness measure in "D. melanogaster" may be irrelevant since fertility declines rapidly with age in this species.
Current State.
The majority of studies have concluded the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis is not true in all cases, and that alternate hypotheses should be tested. In addition to this, recent studies of the hypothesis have provided additional complications, such as trade-offs evident only in field environments and interactions with behavior and life history traits. The study of developmental and phenotypic plasticity continues.

Highland Park General Hospital

The Highland Park General Hospital is a hospital complex located at 357 Glendale Avenue in Highland Park, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
Description.
The Highland Park General Hospital sits on a at the western edge of Highland Park, in an area that is primarily residential. The complex includes three separate buildings. The primary building faces Glendale, and includes the original hospital building, built in 1918, and the attached nurses' residence (1925). The other two buildings are located behind the main unit, and consist of the power plant/laundry buildings (builtin in 1921 and 1940, respectively) and the Contagious and Psychopathic Units (built in 1926). 
This complex of buildings was developed to be a coherent assemblage, united by a common use of materials, utilitarian design, and hierarchical relationship. The buildings constructed before World War II are detailed in a neo-Georgian style characteristic of the early 20th century period of construction, while elements built in the postwar era have no historical or ornamental detailing.
History.
The Highland Park General Hospital is a significant landmark in the history of Highland Park. The hospital was one of the first two institutions established when Highland Park incorporated as a city in 1916. The main building was constructed in the period from 1918–1921, and the growth and usage of the hospital contributed to the strong municipal identity of Highland Park, particularly as Detroit grew and annexed the surrounding suburbs. The Highland Park General Hospital served the city as a hospital until its closing in 1976.

<doc id="19633042" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19633042" title="Impingement syndrome">
Impingement syndrome

Shoulder impingement syndrome, also called subacromial impingement, painful arc syndrome, supraspinatus syndrome, swimmer's shoulder, and thrower's shoulder, is a clinical syndrome which occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and inflamed as they pass through the subacromial space, the passage beneath the acromion. This can result in pain, weakness and loss of movement at the shoulder.
Causes.
The rotator cuff muscle tendons pass through a narrow space between the acromion process of the scapula and the head of the humerus. Anything which causes further narrowing of this space can result in impingement syndrome. This can be caused by bony structures such as subacromial spurs (bony projections from the acromion), osteoarthritic spurs on the acromioclavicular joint, and variations in the shape of the acromion. Thickening or calcification of the coracoacromial ligament can also cause impingement. Loss of function of the rotator cuff muscles, due to injury or loss of strength, may cause the humerus to move superiorly, resulting in impingement. Inflammation and subsequent thickening of the subacromial bursa may also cause impingement.
SIS and the Scapula.
The scapula has been found to play an important role in shoulder impingement syndrome. It is a wide, flat bone lying on the thoracic wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include the muscles of the rotator cuff- the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach to the surface of the scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the glenohumeral joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula. Each of these muscles has their own role in proper shoulder function and must be in balance with each other in order to avoid shoulder pathology. 
Abnormal scapular function is called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is elevation of the acromion process in order to avoid impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.
Signs and symptoms.
The most common symptoms in impingement syndrome are pain, weakness and a loss of movement at the affected shoulder. The pain is often worsened by shoulder overhead movement and may occur at night, especially if the patient is lying on the affected shoulder. The onset of the pain may be acute if it is due to an injury or may be insidious if it is due to a gradual process such as an osteoarthritic spur. Other symptoms can include a grinding or popping sensation during movement of the shoulder.
The range of motion at the shoulder may be limited by pain. A painful arc of movement may be present during forward elevation of the arm from 60° to 120°. Passive movement at the shoulder will appear painful when a downwards force is applied at the acromion but the pain will ease once the downwards force is removed.
Diagnosis.
Impingement syndrome can usually be diagnosed by history and physical exam. On physical exam, the physician may twist or elevate the patient's arm to test for reproducible pain (Neer's sign and Hawkin's sign). These tests help localize the pathology to the rotator cuff, however they are not specific for impingement. Neer's sign may also be seen with subacromial bursitis.
The physician may inject lidocaine (usually combined with a steroid) into the bursa, and if there is an improved range of motion and decrease in pain, this is considered a positive "Impingement Test". It not only supports the diagnosis for impingement syndrome, but it is also therapeutic.
Plain x-rays of the shoulder can be used to detect some joint pathology and variations in the bones, including acromioclavicular arthritis, variations in the acromion, and calcification. However, x-rays do not allow visualization of soft tissue, thus hold a low diagnostic value. Ultrasonography, arthrography and MRI can be used to detect rotator cuff muscle pathology. MRI is the best imaging test prior to arthroscopic surgery. Due to lack of understanding of the pathoaetiology, and lack of diagnostic accuracy in the assessment process by many physicians, several opinions are recommended before intervention.
Treatment.
Impingement syndrome is usually treated conservatively, but sometimes is treated with arthroscopic surgery or open surgery. Conservative treatment includes rest, cessation of painful activity, and physiotherapy. Physiotherapy treatments would typically focus at maintaining range of movement, improving posture, strength of the muscles of the shoulder and scapula, and reduction of pain. Physiotherapists may employ the following treatment techniques to improve pain and function: Joint Mobilization, Interferential Therapy, Acupuncture, Soft Tissue Therapy, Therapeutic Taping, Scapular and rotator cuff Strengthening, and Education regarding the cause and mechanism of the condition.NSAID's and ice packs may be used for pain relief.
Therapeutic injections of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic may be used for persistent impingement syndrome. The total number of injections is generally limited to three due to possible side effects from the corticosteroid.
Corticosteroids actually cause musculoskeletal disorders, which explains the low success rate of cortisone injections. Research has shown that over 90% of tendinopathies have no inflammation, thus the term tendinosis is more appropriate than tendinitis for most diagnoses. For tendinosis, prolotherapy injections or cross-fiber (transverse) friction massage can be very effective.
A number of surgical interventions are available, depending on the nature and location of the pathology. Surgery may be done arthroscopically or as open surgery. The impinging structures may be removed in surgery, and the subacromial space may be widened by resection of the distal clavicle and excision of osteophytes on the under-surface of the acromioclavicular joint. Also damaged rotator cuff muscles can be surgically repaired.
Cools, Witvrouw, Mahieu, and Danneels (2007) researched isokinetic scapular muscle performance in overhead athletes with and without shoulder impingement to identify any deficits in the scapular muscles of athletes with shoulder impingement. Using 30 overhead athletes with shoulder impingement (21 males and 9 females) and 30 overhead athletes (18 males and 12 females) without shoulder pain (mean age of 23.2 years old) they measured scapular protraction and retraction of the scapula at two different velocities (12.2 cm/s and 36.6 cm/s). Using valid and reliable measures, Cools et al. found that overhead athletes with shoulder impingement had decreased force output at both velocities in the protractor muscles compared to their uninjured arm and uninjured overhead athletes. Cools et al. (2007) used the importance of scapular strengthening and observed muscle activity of the upper trapezius, middle trapezius, lower trapezius and serratus anterior during twelve rehabilitation exercises to determine which exercises are the best for scapular strengthening and scapular balance. They used forty-five healthy college-aged students (twenty men and twenty-five women with an average age of 20.7 years old) and placed surface electrodes on the four muscles during the randomized order of the rehabilitation exercises. They found five exercises that had optimal utilization of each of the four scapular muscles: horizontal abduction with external rotation, side lying external rotation, side lying forward flexion, and prone extension. Wilk, Meister, James and Andrews (2002) also discussed the importance of scapular muscle strength and stability in the rehabilitation of shoulder impingement syndrome. They found that rehabilitation techniques for restoring this strength are manual resistance to the scapula during protraction and retraction as well prone horizontal abduction.
History.
Impingement syndrome was reported in 1852. Impingement of the shoulder was previously thought to be precipitated by shoulder abduction and surgical intervention focused on lateral or total acromionectomy. In 1972, Charles Neer proposed that impingement was due to the anterior third of the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament and suggested surgery should be focused on these areas. The role of anteriorinferior aspect of the acromion in impingement syndrome and excision of parts of the anteriorinferior acromion has become a pivotal part of the surgical treatment of the syndrome.
Criticism.
Subacromial impingement is not free of criticism. First, the identification of acromion type shows poor intra- and inter-observer reliability. Second, a computerized three-dimensional study failed to support impingement by any portion of the acromion on the rotator cuff tendons in different shoulder positions. Third, most partial-thickness cuff tears do not occur on bursal surface fibers, where mechanical abrasion from the acromion does occur. Fourth, it has been suggested that bursal surface cuff tears could be responsible for subacromial spurs and not the opposite. And finally, there is growing evidence that routine acromioplasty may not be required for successful rotator cuff repair, which would be an unexpected finding if acromial shape had a major role in generating tendon lesions. In summary, despite being a popular theory, the bulk of evidence suggest that subacromial impingement probably does not play a dominant role in many cases of rotator cuff disease.

Chandeshwar Prasad Narayan Singh

Sir Chandeshwar Prasad Narayan Singh, CIE (1901 - 1993) was a freedom fighter, diplomat and administrator.
Early life.
Singh was born in Parsagarh to an affluent Bhumihar Brahmin zamindar family in Saran district of Bihar. he stood first class-first in his M.A. from Calcutta University, obtaining the Mallick Gold Medal in 1925. After returning to Bihar, he joined the national movement, getting elected to the then Bihar Legislative Council in 1927. He was also elected Chairman of the District Board of Muzaffarpur, where he distinguished himself by exemplary organisation of succour for earthquake victims of the great Bihar Earthquake of 1934. This received special recognition from different organisations, including the Indian National Congress.
Career.
He was conferred a CIE in New Year Honours List of 1935. In 1945, he was appointed as the Vice-Chancellor of the new Patna University. His contribution to development of a post-graduate course in the university was acclaimed by all. He brought teachers of eminence from all over the country to administer the newly opened departments.
The Patna University Institute of Psychological Research and Service, one of the oldest psychological service centres in Eastern India was founded in 1945 by him. The institute is located at Krishna Kunj. The building housing the institute was donated to the university by the late Sir Ganesh Dutt Singh, an eminent educationist of the state. In 1946 he was conferred his knighthood.
After Independence, in 1949, he was invited by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, to become India's ambassador to Nepal. It was during this tenure that the King of Nepal sought refuge at the Indian Embassy in 1950. After completing his tenure in Kathmandu, he was appointed as the Governor of undivided Punjab in 1953. Under his aegis that the city of Chandigarh as well as the Bhakra Dam dam were built. The establishment of the Kurukshetra University was his dream. He wanted to set up an institute to promote Indian culture and traditions. He was also appointed as the governor of Uttar Pradesh. He was a close friend of Jawaharlal Nehru. Also, Pracheen Kala Kendra, an institution for arts and culture was established in Chandigarh in 1956 with his active support and kind patronage. In 1958, he went as India's ambassador to Japan. There he was given an honorary doctorate from Ohtani University. Unable to continue in that post, due to ill-health, he was forced to come back to India.
Zamindari.
Belonging to one of the most elite, enlightened and aristocratic landed families, he opposed the abolition of zamindari, along with Kameshwar Singh of Raj Darbhanga.
Singh was the leader of the pro-establishment landed aristocracy. His speeches from the opposition bench against Restoration of the Bakasht Land Act and the Bihr Tenancy Act by the Congress Ministry during 1937-39 and Krishna Singh's forceful defence, though they added a memorable chapter in the province's legislative history, marked the division of the aristocracy into pro and anti-Congress factions.
Retirement.
After retriement he became a director of the Reserve Bank of India and also of the I.D.B.I. and chairman of several companies. In 1977 he was honoured with a Padma Vibhushan for meritorious services rendered to the country.

Ganesh Dutt

Sir Ganesh Dutt Singh (1868–1943) was an Indian administrator and educationist. He did much to improve education and health services in the state of Bihar and Orissa before the independence of India from Britain. Dutt made generous donations from his earnings and personal property for the development of educational institutions, such as the radium institute in Patna Medical College, Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, Ayurvedic College and schools for the blind and deaf. A short film based on the life and works of Dutt was made by Prakash Jha.
Dutt was Minister for Local Self Government of Bihar and Orissa under British rule, and one of the major public figures of the province of Bihar. Sir Ganesh Dutt donated his house Krishna Kunj to Patna University to start the Patna University Institute of Psychological Research and Service, one of the oldest psychological service centres in Eastern India in 1945 at the initiative of Sir Chandeshwar Prasad Narayan Singh Sinha, the Vice Chancellor of Patna University. Dutt saved nearly three-quarters of his salary each month for 14 years to give it to various charities to benefit orphans, widows, and schools in the state.
He took keen interest in Patna University's development. He donated some of his assets to the University and worked to terminate the practice of appointing former judges as vice-chancellors; Sachchidanand Sinha became the first VC of Patna University who was not a judge.
Biography.
Dutt was born to a Bhumihar Brahmin family in Chhatiyana village, Nalanda district, Bihar state. He matriculated five years later with first division and a scholarship for proficiency in mathematics. He then became a modestly successful lawyer, and later a minister in the government of Bihar and Orissa from 1923 to 1937, the longest tenure for any minister anywhere in the British Empire. Dutt was the "Minister of Local Self Government" in the British Cabinet from 1923 till 1937 when the Provincial Government was established. While he was the Minister of Local Self Government, Dutt was made Knight Bachelor by the British for his contributions to the public good. State functions are organized by the Government of Bihar on the anniversary of Dutt's birth on 13 January every year.
Philanthropic works.
Sir Ganesh continued as a minister of Bihar and Orissa till 31 March 1936. After the separation of Orissa and Bihar he continued to hold the position. He became minister on the 27th of March, 1923 and five years later in June, 1928, he was knighted by the King Emperor, in recognition of his ability as an administrator and his service to the country. He retired from ministership on the introduction of provincial autonomy in 1937 after having held office continuously for 14 years from 1923. During his tenure of office as minister he set apart most of his salary for charitable and educational purposes.
He gave Rs. 1 lakh to Patna University on November 30, 1931, and a further Rs. 2 lakhs on May 27, 1933. With this endowment the Patna University Sir Ganesh Dutt Singh's Trust Fund was created, funding loan scholarships for higher studies in industry, agriculture, science, medicine, engineering, etc. Dutt required that, all else being equal, preference was to be given to the untouchable castes and backward castes over the forward castes.
Patna University awarded him the degree of Doctor Honouris Causa in 1933.
Policy criticism.
In 1928 there had been widespread agitation in Bihar due to an ill-advised step on the part of the ruling British Government in superseding the District Board at Gaya and removing Anugraha Narain Sinha, a prominent national leader, from its chairmanship. Sri Krishna Sinha(first Chief Minister of Bihar),leader of the Congress party, disapproved of the policy of Ganesh Dutt Singh as Minister of the Local-Self Government in superseding the Gaya district board, and came down heavily on the government in the Bihar and Orissa Legislative council.

Jenny Warren is an American female singer, best known as the co-founder of the all-female tribute band The Iron Maidens.
Biography.
Jenny Warren first had an Iron Maiden tribute band called Wrathchild. The idea came when she discovered the website of a Chicago-based tribute band called Revelations. Wrathchild started with Warren (using the stage name "Bruce Chickinson") as the only female member, but when bassist Melanie Sisneros (formerly of Raven Mad and New Eden) joined in 2000, Warren decided to give the band a new direction within the next year.
On June 2001, Warren and Sisneros were joined by guitarist Sara Marsh (formerly of Bandit), drummer Linda McDonald and guitarist Josephine Draven (both formerly of Phantom Blue) to form The Iron Maidens ("World's Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden"). The band found some success while touring across the U.S.
In 2003, the Maidens started work on their , but production was halted when Warren left the band. The need to raise an autistic child contributed to her departure, which the band did not make official until early 2004. Later that year, rock/R&B singer/songwriter Aja Kim was announced as Warren's successor by the Maidens.
Shortly after leaving the Maidens, Warren regrouped Wrathchild with Sisneros (who left the Maidens in late 2002) for a one-off performance at MetalJam, a fund-raising event to promote autism awareness and raise funds for charities to find a cure for autism. She also played bass for the all-female AC/DC tribute band Whole Lotta Rosies for a short period of time.
Recently Jenny (A.J.) Warren’s original abstract acrylic painting “dive in,” was selected for inclusion in the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Orange County’s 4TH Annual Art Walk, a juried event, hosted by Room & Board, at South Coast Plaza Village in Southern California, on August 9th, 2013.

Fuzhou Gezhi High School (; pinyin: Fúzhōu Gézhì Zhōngxué), also referred to as Gezhi, is a comprehensive three-year public high school located in the centre of Fuzhou City at the north foot of Mount Yu, enrolling 1980 students in grades 10 through 12. The school, established by Justus Doolittle, an ABCFM missionary, in 1846, is one of the oldest high schools in China supported by a foreign church. Spanning over 33380 square meters, Gezhi has the second largest campus among all high schools in Fuzhou, after Fuzhou No.1 Middle School.
Curriculum.
Credits are granted for most of the courses and are essential for the graduation of Gezhi students. Students in Grade 10 have to take all main courses including Chinese Literature, Mathematics, English, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, History, Geography, Politics and some of the subordinate courses including General Technology, Information Technology, Music, P.E and Fine Arts. As soon as they enter Grade 11, students can choose between sciences (Chemistry, Physics and Biology) and liberal arts courses (History, Geography and Politics). Once the choice is made, students will no longer have to earn credits for the opposite set of courses, and those three courses won’t be in their National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or Gaokao. Also, at the end of Grade 10, students ranking among the top of the same grader will be selected into advanced experimental classes, which offer the most demanding courses at Gezhi.
A typical Gezhi student takes eight 45-minute classes a day, five days a week for 16 weeks a semester, 2 semesters a year. The exact numbers of school days each week and school weeks each semester may vary depending on the date of Chinese holidays every year.

Sense and Nonsense

Sense and Nonsense is an American game show hosted by Bob Kennedy which ran on New York City TV station WABD from 1951-1954. The show consisted of two three-child teams using their five senses to complete challenges and earn money, with the high-scoring team returning on the next show.
Sponsored by Coca-Cola (specifically "Coke in-a-bottle"), and with a somewhat-unorthodox Monday-Wednesday-Friday airing schedule, "Sense" has since gained something of a "cult following" among fans of early television. While only shown on WABD, it is often considered a DuMont Television Network program due to not only being on the network's flagship affiliate, but having several production "quirks" typical of many DuMont programs.
Episode status.
Only one episode is known to exist, from February 19, 1954 (one commercial mentions the upcoming weekend and celebrating George Washington's birthday with Coke in-a-bottle, showing a boy and girl doing so in Colonial attire and powdered wigs). Among other things, the episode is notable for a young Leonard Frey playing on the challenging team.
This episode is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, but can be purchased on DVD through various public-domain retailers and is available for viewing on the Internet Archive.

Political career.
During early years, as a Robust student political leader with revolutionary leadership skills in Gorakhpur University,all of 19 years of age he openly challenged Nehru and his policies causing the then Prime minister to order shoot at sight orders against him and fellow students in the infamous Gorakhpur student shootout in 1967 in which Rais' best friend was shot,whose statue still stands tall at Gorakhpur university. The same leadership skills were again displayed by show of no-support to Indira Gandhi when she first came to power, after Rai joined Congress in 1974 at the behest in of Shri H.N Bahuguna and Mrs. Gandhi on the count that Mau (MauNathBhanjan) will be given separate district status from Azamgarh. After the creation of MAU, he intensified development procedures in the district bringing technology,industry,prosperity, trade and modern infrastructure to a part of India which has been known to be one of the most backward and poor in recent times. Also during his tenure as MP, the district was attributed to be very peaceful and with no communal violence even though the whole region of eastern uttar pradesh was and is communally tense.
He was Member of Parliament for a continued tenure of 25 years across party lines and in 1982 he was given 2 portfolios of Parliamentary affairs and Industry minister.His motives were always development-centric and people oriented. His affection for the people and the people's affection for him was shown in his last 2 elections when he was falsely implicated for corruption charges,the people cut across party and religious lines and voted for him to bring him back to power.
In 1993-1994 he was minister of state for food and became controversial due to the sugar scam involving his ministry. He was falsely jailed in connection with the scam but was later acquitted with no charge.
In 1997 he was wrongly sentenced to 10 years in prison with a fine of Rs 1 million by a Terrorist And Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act court in Delhi, he was soon acquitted, with the judge Justice Verma stating that "if my son comes home after committing a murder and sleeps in my house without me knowing then am i responsible for the murder?". He was falsely convicted for the crime of harboring members of the Dawood Ibrahim gang and later acquitted without any charge. According to the CBI chargesheet, Kalpnath Rai, the then Federal Power Minister, had through his assistant S P Rai arranged accommodation for Subhash Thakur and V N Rai (Rai's nephew) at the guest houses of the National Thermal Power Corporation in Delhi and Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply at Mumbai around the time of the shootout at the JJ Hospital. He was soon acquitted after being proven innocent.Dawood's hitmen, who were convicted, were involved in the shootout. The bills for the NTPC rooms were paid by the corporation itself.
A frontrunner from Ghosi, Uttar Pradesh,Kalpanath Rai was an AICC General Secretary in the Indira Gandhi regime and a minister in the Rajiv gandhi and Narasimha Rao government. He was also one of the rare politicians to win a Lok Sabha election independently while in jail for the TADA case in which he was falsely accused.
Kalpanath Rai was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh in 1974 and had two other terms in the same House. He was also elected to the Lok Sabha four times from Ghosi. In the last Lok Sabha, Rai was elected on a Samata Party ticket but he resigned from the party and rejoined the Congress.
Kalpanath Rai began his career in 1963 as general secretary of the Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha, UP. Rai, who did his M.A (English and Sociology) and LLB from Gorakhpur University, was a member of the CPP executive committee between 1974–76 and its general secretary in 1978.
Rai's stint as a union minister began in 1982 when he was made a minister of state in the Indira Gandhi government and continued till 1984. From June 1988 to December 1989, he was minister of state for Power and after being elected to the 10th Lok Sabha, he was again made minister of state for Power and non-conventional energy sources with independent charge.
In 1993-1994 he was minister of state for food and became controversial due to the sugar scam involving his ministry. He was jailed in connection with the scam but was later acquitted free of charge.
In Ghosi, Kalpnath Rai was considered one of the most strong leaders. In 1991, he was one of the rare Congressmen who survived the mandal-mandir upheavals that uprooted the party in Uttar Pradesh; in 1996, when imprisoned under TADA, he won as an Independent from jail; in his last election he fought the elections from the Samata Party but still went on to win the elections. Kalpanath Rai had been highly active in the development and promotion of his home town Mau. Meanwhile Rai is not averse to some theatre. Voice quivering with emotion, he made dramatic promises saying, "Jis maa ka doodh piya hai uski kasam khata hoon (I swear on my mother's milk).".Known for his blunt and colorful language he is famous for warning the then Prime Minister Rao in parliament that he will "strip him of his dhoti" as Rao's son had approached Rai on behalf of the sugar and alcohol lobbyists of India to reduce the price of molasses which would have been beneficial to the farmers of India rather than big business houses.

Optimal Flexible Architecture

Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA), a standard of Oracle Corporation, encourages consistent layouts when installing and configuring the Oracle Database product on computer systems.
Overview.
OFA defines where each component will install its files. In many respects it resembles the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) on UNIX systems in which, for example, the directory "/bin" always holds the essential system binaries — so when administrators and users use other systems they will already know where to find the standard system binaries. OFA takes FHS standard-style concepts and uses them for Oracle products on UNIX and on Windows. In this way Oracle Database administrators will find familiar structures and locations of the various applications and data installed on any OFA-compliant system.
OFA covers where to install each part of each product; it addresses the storage of both applications and data. Much like the FHS, OFA imposes no constraints on the locations: it merely makes recommendations.
Oracle Corporation has structured the OFA system so that system administrators can use multiple disks (for example: applications on one disk and databases on another). OFA also allows for installing multiple versions of the same product on the same host: for example Oracle Database 9 and Oracle Database 10.
Directory structure.
Each main Oracle-oriented directory on each disk consists of a string ('u' or 'disk' by default) with a unique identifier (often a 2-digit number) appended,
for example: codice_1 or codice_2. Administrators store data and application-code within these directories, and Oracle products reference these directories. If desired, one can use symbolic links to map the main directories into physical disk storage.
Within each main directory a number of subdirectories can exist. Commonly used subdirectories include:
For example: codice_5 may contains the binaries for Oracle 10.2.0. If a system has an Oracle Database instance called codice_6, then codice_7 may contain information about that codice_6's datafiles: this could point to a collection of datafiles in codice_9, etc.

Chatham Islands skink

The Chatham Island skink, "Oligosoma nigriplantare", is a species of skink in the family Scincidae.
It is the sole reptile species found on the Chatham Islands of New Zealand where it occurs on all the major islands except Chatham Island itself. Given the geological history of the Chatham Islands, it is assumed that "O. n. nigriplantare" previously occurred on Chatham Island; however, there are no fossil records or historical reports of "O. n. nigriplantare" on Chatham Island. Since "O. n. nigriplantare" is almost locally extinct on Pitt Island as a result of introduced mammals, the presence of introduced mammals on Chatham Island might have resulted in the local extinction of "O. n. nigriplantare". On vegetated islands, "O. n. nigriplantare" inhabits grassland and shrub habitat, but it also occurs on marine rock stacks with sparse vegetation. Substantial morphological variation (body size, colour and colour pattern) is evident within "O. n. nigriplantare", potentially indicating morphological evolution following its colonization of the Chatham Islands. Indeed, "O. n. nigriplantare" (up to 91 mm Snout to Vent Length; SVL) has a substantially larger body size than "O. n. polychroma" (up to 77 mm SVL).
Recent genetic studies indicate that "O. n. nigriplantare" diverged from "Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma" (its nearest relative) 5.86–7.29 million years ago. This pre-dates the emergence date for the Chatham Islands, but indicates that "O. n. nigriplantare" colonized the Chatham Islands via overwater dispersal on a single occasion. There is substantial morphological variability evident in "O. n. nigriplantare", and a shallow level of genetic differential between islands within the Chatham Islands indicating low gene flow between islands, but not speciation between islands. The level of genetic and morphological divergence between "O. n. nigriplantare" and "Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma" might warrant their recognition as distinct species.

Overview.
This village has one government primary school, a government higher secondary school and a government hospital with decent space and buildings. The schools and Hospital are very good in facilities when compared to surrounding villages. It has very small public library and had very good movie hall but it was closed few years ago because of some financial reason.
Now the Vembadithalam Primary School (Elementary School, from 1st Standard Class to 5th Class) infrastructure is in pathetic picture of neglect and utter lack of basic facilities by officials and the big people of Vembadithalam. Please visit the school to understand the situation. This shows the domination of matriculation and private schools. The little students here are from underprivileged category. A personal visit to the school shown that these students are very brilliant and willing to learn and excel in their studies. The Primary School seriously needs help from all the ends like old students of the school, businessmen, officials etc.
While Higher Secondary School getting financial help from all the ends like few engineering colleges, polytechnic and businessmen for their personal benefit but Vembadithalam Primary School(Elementary School) does not get any help.
Culture.
Textile is most important business. Mostly Kannada Devanga Chettiar community people doing the textile business or they shown the way to other community people to follow the textile business. On every week of Tuesday weaver gets weekly wages and they will do their purchases in nearby weekly market. Sowdeswari Amman temple, Marriamman and Kaliamman temple, Subramanya swamy temple and Perumal Kovil (temple) and Kasi vishwanatha temple are major temples. Sowdeswari Amman festival, Marriamman and Kaliamman festivals are celebrated every year without fail. Whole village get the new color on those festival days.

Current Business.
The early business in vembadithalam started with handlooms and weavers were getting yarns from Salem and woven it. Then slowly started their own business and nowadays cotton clothes manufacturing, especially silk sarees are being manufactured and bulkly distributed throughout India.
Facilities.
Tamil Nadu’s first rural telephone exchange opened in Vembadithalam. Mr. Chandra sekaran has worked as a first incharge of that. It happened because of two weavers from this village; they were persons who weaved the polyester with handloom and show the new market for polyester yarn. Their name is Mr. KMS Rangasamy Chettiar and Mr. KMS Mari Chettiar respectively. Then Tamil Nadu governor VV Giri came to village to honour them. These two legend helped the village to have decent Govt hospital, Govt Primary school and a very good & well maintained Govt Higher Secondary School. Students from surrounding villages like Rakkipatti, Seeragapady, elampillai, vaikuntham, Sankakiri, Attayampatti, Vennandhur all are coming to this Government Higher Secondary School to pursue their study. This Government Higher Secondary School is well equipped with all Physics Lab, Chemistry Lab, Computer Labs and a wide eco friendly play ground. The one good thing about this school is whenever teacher transfer counselling happen, teachers are literally willing to come to this school to serve their entire service & Scholl celebrated its golden jubilee years Today 25.01.2014.
It is known fact that Mr. Dhanasekaran belonging to this vaillage had first started the yarn business years ago. Then the yarn business spread over to nearby villages elambillai, perumagoundan patti and attayampatti. But it's a question mark whether he is doing the yarn business actively nowadays. The Shree Veera Lakshmi Silks run by Janarthanan and Prakash (Military Nataraj Sons) is found to be a genuine silk manufacturer and they have distribution all over India.

1998–99 Liga Alef

The 1998–99 Liga Alef season was held between 11 September 1998 and 29 May 1999. It was the last season (until 2009–10) in which Liga Alef was the third tier of Israeli football, as the creation of the Israeli Premier League in the summer of 1999 meant that it became the fourth tier.
Due to the restructuring, two clubs were due to be promoted from each division; Hapoel Ra'anana and Hapoel Nazareth Illit from the north and Hapoel Dimona and Hapoel Ramat Gan from the south.
During the summer of 1999, Maccabi Jaffa were demoted to Liga Alef (from Liga Leumit) after their budget was not approved by the Israel Football Association, which resulted in Maccabi Sha'arayim (the third-placed club with the highest points total) being promoted alongside the top two from the South Division. In addition, Hapoel Ashdod, Hapoel Lod and SK Nes Tziona were all demoted from Liga Artzit after their budgets were not approved by the IFA. This resulted in the third- and fourth-placed clubs from the North Division (Hapoel Iksal and Hapoel Acre) and the fourth-placed club in the South Division (Shimshon Tel Aviv) also being promoted.

Michael O'Hickey

Michael Patrick O'Hickey (12 March 1860 – 1916) was an Irish Catholic priest and professor of Irish at Maynooth College and an Irish language campaigner.
Michael O'Hickey was born in Carrickbeg, County Waterford, Ireland. He studied for the priesthood in St. John's College, Waterford, and was ordained a priest in 1884. He was an active member of the Gaelic League and studied under the noted Irish scholar Sean Plemion.
In 1896 he was appointed professor of Irish in Maynooth College, succeeding Fr. Eugene O'Growney. 
He clashed with the bishops and establishment and was dismissed in 1909 from his position as Professor of Irish, for his conduct in the controversy over Irish as a matriculation subject for the new National University of Ireland.
He received support for many Irish Nationalist (including Patrick Pearse whom he earlier had disagreements with) and language activists and some of his colleagues such as the Theology Professor in Maynooth, Walter McDonald.
He appealed his dismissal to the Vatican, however his appeal was refused.
Sometimes his name appears as Michael Hickey rather than Micheal O'Hickey, or even in Irish as An tAthair Micheál Ó hIcí. 
He died in 1916 and is buried in the Friary Cemetery in Carrick Beg, Co. Waterford.

Baikuntha Shukla

Baikunth Shukla (1907–1934) was an Indian nationalist and revolutionary. He was the nephew of Yogendra Shukla, one of the founders of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).
He was hanged for murdering Phanindra Nath Ghosh who had become a government approver which led to hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. Baikunth Shukla was also initiated into the freedom struggle at a young age taking active part in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930. He was associated with revolutionary organisations like the Hindustan Seva Dal and HSRA. The execution of Indian revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev in 1931 as a result of their trial in the Lahore conspiracy case was an event that shook the entire country. 
Phanindra Nath Ghosh, hitherto a key member of the Revolutionary Party had treacherously betrayed the cause by turning an approver, giving evidence, which led to the execution. Baikunth was commissioned to plan the execution of Ghosh as an act of ideological vendetta which he carried out successfully on 9 November 1932. He was arrested and tried for the killing. Baikunth was convicted and hanged in Gaya Central Jail on May 14, 1934. He was only 28 years old.
Early life.
Baikuntha Shukla was born in 1910 in village Jalalpur in Muzaffarpur District (now Vaishali). He got his elementary education at his village and became a teacher in a lower primary school in village Mathurapur. He took active part in Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930 and was imprisonedin Patna Camp Jail. He was released along with other Satyagrahis after the Gandhi Irwin Pact. Later he came in contact with the members of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army and became a revolutionary.

Refugee week

Refugee Week takes place in June each year. It is regularly used as a platform for holding hundreds of arts, cultural and educational events.
Refugee Week events are often intended to celebrate the contribution of refugees to the United Kingdom, and encourage a better understanding between communities.
Dates of Refugee Week.
Refugee Week always takes place in the week closest to World Refugee Day (20 June).
The dates for 2009–2012 are as follows:
Refugee Week events.
Events during Refugee Week are usually organised by different charities, local governments, refugee community organisations, schools, faith groups, arts organisations, day centres and umbrella networks.
A multi-agency organisation called the Refugee Week partnership leads on unifying the events.
Events organised during Refugee Week are held independently from the Refugee Week partnership and are not obliged to follow the suggested direction of the partnership.
Events include the annual Umbrella Parade and the Celebrating Sanctuary Festival in London. 2011 will also see a "100% British created by refugees" campaign to celebrate the contribution of refugees to British society, as well as a Simple Acts campaign which encourages people do a least one simple action in order to make a big change to the way refugees are perceived in the UK.
The Refugee Week partnership.
The strategic direction of Refugee Week is organised by the Refugee Week partnership, which is a multi-agency project, with representatives from the partner agencies forming the UK Steering and Operation Groups. The partner agencies of the Refugee Week partnership currently include: Amnesty International UK, British Red Cross, the Children's Society, Freedom from Torture, the Home Office, Oxfam, Refugee Action, Refugee Council, Save the Children Fund UK, Scottish Refugee Council, Student Action for Refugees, UNHCR, and Welsh Refugee Council
The Refugee Week partnerships’ slogan is "Different Pasts, Shared Future".
The Refugee Week partnership encourages event organisers to organise events around the idea that Refugee Week is a "space of encounters" between different communities and an opportunity to use more creative ways to bring refugee experiences closer to wider audiences.
Refugee Week Radio.
The week also features an online broadcast by Refugee Week Radio with content produced by groups such as Refugee Radio and the British Red Cross.

King's Mill, Castle Donington

King's Mill is the traditional crossing point of the River Trent between Castle Donington in Leicestershire and Weston-on-Trent in Derbyshire. The Mill was the farthest point that traffic from the River Humber could progress. A lock was installed here to make the river navigable but the business eventually collapsed due to competition with the Trent and Mersey Canal. The mill was used for grinding flints for the pottery industry, locally mined plaster, and dyestuffs when it was owned by Samuel Lloyd of the Birmingham banking company.
History.
Activity in this area is known to date from 3,500 bce as a log loat was discovered in nearby Shardlow which contained stones quarried at King's Mill. The stone is presumed to have been destined for strengthening a causeway across the River Trent. This boat is now preserved in Derby Museum.
Control of this river crossing is first mentioned in a charter agreed by Æþelræd Unræd (King Ethelred the Unready) in 1009 which recognised the position and boundaries of Weston. The charter shows that Weston controlled the crossings of the Trent at, Weston Cliff, Kings Mill and Wilne. These crossings controlled one of the main routes for travellers moving up or down England and was a boundary within Mercia. This land was then given to Morkar, the King's chief minister, and he was unusually given rights that were normally reserved for the King alone. He was given the responsibility for justice and exemption from the trinoda, he alone could decide a fate of life or death without the need of the authority of the King or his sheriff. 
In February 1309 a dispute was settled between Henry de Lacy of Castle Donington and the Abbey of Chester over the fishing rights here. Unusually the dispute was settled not with either side having rights up to the middle of the river, but with the manor of Castle Donington owning their land and the river up to the northern bank. The boundary of Derbyshire and Leicestershire still take this line.
Navigation and locks.
In 1699 and 1710 Lord Paget was able to obtain an Act of Parliament to make the River Trent navigable to Burton. He set on George Hayne of Wirksworth to manage this, who in turn entered into a partnership with Leonard Fosbrooke of Shardlow Hall. Paget was given a monopoly on the river traffic although he had to construct two locks, one at Burton and the other at King's Mill to bypass the weir. The initial construction was a flash lock but this was unpopular as it required considerable energy to move boats up stream and meanwhile the mill would see a sudden flow of additional water. The locks were converted to the more conventional pound lock.
Various people tried to break the monopoly but the lock remained a weapon against delinquents. At one time a lock gate was removed and another, the lock was loaded with rocks. Each time boats were stranded and cargoes delayed. For nine years the lessees had a stone laden barge sunk in the navigation at King's Mills. The sole purpose of this device was to create the need for goods to be taken from one boat upstream to another below and viceversa. By this method they were able to ensure that the rate of three pence per ton was paid. 
It was not until threatening letters were sent in 1756 by the Earl of Leicester that safe passage was assured and the lock was said to be the "best lock ever seen".
A new partnership was formed in 1763 to found the "Burton Boat Company" a minor shareholder was Samuel Lloyd's father who had a fifth share. One of the holdings was the mill itself which could have been a route for travellers wishing to avoid the toll.
The Trent continued to be used to transport goods including from Burton upon Trent which could be transported east and on to the Baltic states. However the river could not compete with the Trent and Mersey Canal and the business closed in 1805.
The mill and Lloyd's bankers.
In 1805 the business was abandoned but the Quaker Samuel Lloyd, whose father had been one of the purchasers, was able to obtain the lease on the mill. As a banker he was able to run this business largely from his offices in Birmingham. The mill was used to grind plaster, flints, and dye stuffs. It is said that the papers of the bank make few references to Kings Mills except that in one note it is recorded that "Cousin Samuel has gone to visit his Flint mills".
In 1817, Kings Mill is listed as one of the few fords across the Trent, the others being at Barrow-upon-Trent, Newton Solney, Winchill, Willington and Ingleby. Although it is noted that only the locals would use these as they were considered too dangerous. At the time there were safer chain ferry crossings. The nearest was at Weston Cliff.
Until the middle of the twentieth century there was a chain ferry across the Trent at this point. The posts can still be seen (in 2008).

Suio

Suio is a "frazione" (rural borough) of Castelforte, a municipality in southern Latium, central Italy. 
Overview.
It is located on the northernmost slopes of the Monti Aurunci, near the Garigliano river, and is composed of two villages: Suio Paese (or Suio Alto), situated on a hill with a medieval castle, and Forma di Suio, at the feet of the castle, in a location where thermal baths exists. The latter were mentioned since ancient times by writers such as Pliny the Elder and Lucan (Suio was a center of the Aurunci before the Roman conquest), and were frequented till the late Roman imperial times. Bath tourism became again active after World War II. Part of the Battle of the Garigliano (1503) was fought nearby.
Other sights include the 13th century church of Santa Maria in Pensulis, which was perhaps built over a Roman villa, and was originally owned by the Knights Hospitaller of Gaeta, and the 15th century church of San Michele Arcangelo, at Suio Alto.

<doc id="19633434" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19633434" title="TV Guide (Canada)">
TV Guide (Canada)

TV Guide is a Canadian version, and later spin-off, of the American weekly magazine "TV Guide". It was originally published by McMurray Publishing, a subsidiary of the American parent company Triangle Publishing, from 1953 to 1976, and after its split from the US parent, became the property of Telemedia in 1977 and then Transcontinental Media in 2000. It was published as a print magazine until 2006, at which point the weekly print edition was retired in favor of a website, though occasional print specials have been published as recently as 2010.
History.
For many years, the Canadian edition of "TV Guide" was virtually the same as the US version, right down to the US ads in the colour section (until the mid-1970s, some Canadian "TV Guide" editions were also sold in some border American markets). The only differences were the price (in 1972, the US edition was 15¢, while in Canada, it was 25¢) and the publisher (the "Saturday" listings featured the notice, "This Canadian magazine is distributed, assembled and prepared by McMurray Publishing Company, Ltd..."). McMurray Publishing was a subsidiary of Triangle Publications, Inc., the U.S. based firm owned by Walter H. Annenberg. It was Annenberg who pulled together a handful of local TV magazines and launched the national edition of TV Guide in 1953. At least eleven editions were available across the country covering the major cities.
The magazine's original format consisted of several editorial articles on TV programming and/or issues related to television, with the bulk of the magazine featuring TV listings specific to the market served by a particular edition.
Beginning in January 1977, the Canadian "TV Guide" split off on its own, at first using some of the same stories and covers as the US version, but eventually publishing completely different editorial content, often with a Canadian focus although the Canadian edition also published features and photos on American productions that did not appear in the US version. The magazine, which otherwise used a similar logo to that of the American version, was published by Telemedia. Interestingly, Telemedia continued to use the same 70s US "TV Guide" logo and staple-bound format right up to the late-1990s, even as their former US counterpart began to update their logo and adopted perfect square binding during the 1980s. Similarly, while the US "TV Guide" began reducing its TV listings in favor of more editorial content, until the 2000s the bulk of the Canadian magazine's content remained the localized listings. A series of sharp price increases were applied, rising to $0.30, $0.35, and ultimately close to a dollar per issue. Telemedia sold the magazine to Transcontinental Media in 2000.
On February 24, 2004, "TV Guide" changed its format from a digest size, similar to the American version, to a larger format (similar in size to a comic book). The need to keep the page count reasonable while listing an increased number of channels was cited in the first new issue as the primary rationale for moving to larger pages. With the change in format came the decision by the magazine to cease printing 24-hour listings (following a similar decision by the US version); overnight programming was left off in order to focus on more frequently viewed hours, which elicited reader complaints.
As of November 5, 2005, "TV Guide" was reduced from the six remaining editions to two, one for Eastern Canada and one for Western Canada.
After receiving numerous complaints about the new format (one which severely condensed cross-country listings), changes were introduced in the November 26 edition. A year-end double issue for the December 24, 2005 to January 6, 2006 period was entirely in colour and included further scaled back listings.
On October 19, 2006, Transcontinental announced it would cease publication of "TV Guide", with the last issue to be dated November 25 (and on newsstands November 20). Transcontinental said "TV Guide" would be transitioned to a "web publication", as the defunct magazine's website would be expanded. Although not the first publication to abandon print in favor of a digital version, "TV Guide" Canada was one of the first major Canadian magazines to do so.
tvguide.ca.
On December 1, 2006, "TV Guide" opened its new website at tvguide.ca, hosted by Sympatico/MSN. By 2008, the site began to carry listings through zap2it, an American listings service.
While "TV Guide" has embraced the use of the internet to distribute content, it still occasionally publishes printed magazine specials on noteworthy events, under the tvguide.ca imprint. These specials included a special tribute to Princess Diana, which was released on May 6, 2007 and sold for $7.99+tax; a special issue to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Food Network Canada, which was released October 4, 2010, and also sold for $7.99+tax; and a Prince William - Catherine royal visit special, released in Fall 2011.
In December 2012, tvguide.ca was replaced with The Loop, Sympatico's lifestyle and entertainment portal, which incorporated TV Guide's television news and listings.

<doc id="19633440" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19633440" title="Request line">
Request line

A request line or contest line is a telephone line which allows listeners to a radio station (or sometimes a TV station) to call the radio studio or TV studio directly. In radio, this is usually to request a song, win a contest, be a part of a talk show, or to ask a question of the disk jockey, such as what the name and artist of a recent song was. Used occasionally in television, it is typically for telephone voting for an unscientific opinion poll in relation to news events, for a talk show, or sometimes to win a contest. 
Telephone network.
Although only one telephone number is usually announced, major stations typically have line hunting, with the same number being directed to any available one of several lines within the hunt group. If there are no open lines, the calling party may receive a busy signal as with an ordinary telephone call, or sometimes the special information tones followed by a recorded announcement that "all circuits are busy, please try your call again later". In this case, the line often first gives that caller a ringback tone as if the call were being completed, misleading callers to think they may have actually gotten through the swarm of other calls that sometimes flood these lines.
Within the North American Numbering Plan, telephone companies typically use special numbers for these lines, with a reserved prefix corresponding to high-capacity multi-line numbers instead of to a physical telephone exchange. In Miami, for example, numbers are 305-550-"xxxx", while in metro Atlanta they are 404-741-"xxxx". The last four digits are usually chosen by the station to be their callsign or frequency, or their moniker if it is short (such as B937 (2937) for a fictional B-93.7 FM).
When used on a radio or television program carried on a broadcast network, such a number is usually a toll-free telephone number, without a special number since it simply redirects to a local request line circuit. This allows anyone to call regardless of the location, even from a payphone. Some stations may have vertical service codes for use by mobile telephones. These are also common in the United States for TV stations to advertise for gathering news tips from the public, but are often specific to callers on a certain sponsoring mobile telephone company.
Screening and editing.
Calls typically come into the studio on a multi-line telephone, which is equipped to connect callers to the audio console and onto the air via a telephone hybrid. However, in modern broadcasting, this is not always the case.
Call screeners may take the calls initially in an adjacent room (or simply away from the microphone), in order to determine which ones would get onto the air, particularly in the case of a talk show. Most call-in shows have special software which the screener types the caller's information into, which in turn appears on the computer in front of the host. This is how he or she knows how to introduce the caller by name and often by location. This in turn alerts the caller, who has often been on hold for several minutes and may be listening to the radio or TV instead of the line, that he or she is now on the air. Such a notification is often also a part of broadcast law if the caller may not have called with the expectation of being on the air.
A brief broadcast delay may be used to allow profanity or other inappropriate content (and possibly the caller) to be dropped, or voice tracking may be used to record calls to a computer, where the call can be digitally edited for time and content. This method is most common with contest winners or callers to "all-request" shows like "Delilah", and is done quickly for airplay just a few minutes later.

Nakheel Harbour and Tower

Nakheel Harbour and Tower was a multibillion dollar real estate project planned in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It was being built by the developer Nakheel, who once declared that the finished development will be the new, unofficial capital of Dubai. When completed, the project was expected to contain the world's tallest structure, the Nakheel Tower, and the world's largest inner city marina. The site was to cover approximately 270 hectares. The development and masterplan of the project are based on Islamic principles of design. The project was cancelled due to the Late-2000s financial crisis.
Plans for the tower indicated that it would have been more than 1 kilometer high, with one report stating a height of 1,400 meters (4,593 ft). However, Nakheel never disclosed the structure's final height. According to Nakheel, it was to have more than 200 floors and about 150 elevators. In height, it would have far surpassed the Burj Khalifa.
Another 40 smaller towers were to stand in the area surrounding the main tower. The development would have also include promenades, part of the Arabian Canal, pedestrian bridges, and several forms of easily-accessible public transportation. Over 50,000 people were expected to live in the development if it were completed.
However, in January 2009, because of the Late-2000s financial crisis, the tower was put on hold, and was cancelled 18 months later.
A station on the Dubai Metro's Red Line is named after Nakheel Harbor and Tower.

Banaili

Banaili estate in Bihar was one of the largest estates in India. It covered parts of regions that are currently located in four of India's current states, namely, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Orissa. Like the Raj Darbhanga, it was also headed by Karn Kayasthas .
The name of the estate derives from a village Banaili [http://discoverbihar.bih.nic.in/pages/pur_place.htm] in the then Purnia district of Bengal.
The main centres of residences of Rajas of Banaili are Banaili, Ramnagar, Champanagar, Srinagar, Garh Banaili, and Sultanganj. Bhagalpur was the centre from where administration of the estate was carried out.
One of the centres of Banaili Raj located in Sultanganj is believed to have ancient historical or mythical association. The Krishnagarh palace built by Kumar Krishnanand Singh on Sultanganj is in the Karnagarh area, which is believed to be place where the Castle of King Karna of Mahabharata was located.[http://www.hindubooks.org/temples/bihar/sultanganj/page2.htm]
Raja Bahadur Dular Singh Chowdhry.
Though the roots of the family can be traced to 11th - 12 th century as done ably by Girijanand Sinha in his book, Banaili - Roots to Raj, the family achieved its famed eminence only in the 19th century during the reign of Raja Bahadur Dular Singh Chowdhry. It was Raja Dular Singh who fixed the family residence at Banaili and gave the family its current name. He was an enterprising Raja and added to the family's wealth using the opportunities afforded by the Permanent Settlement implemented by Lord Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis in the then state of Bengal. He received the title of Raja Bahadur from the British Government for his services during the Anglo-Nepalese War. Raja Dular Singh died in 1821.
Raja Bahadur Bedanand Sinha.
The expansion of the Banaili Raj continued under his able son, Raja Bahadur Bedanand Sinha. He was born in 1778 and succeeded his father at an advanced age of 43. He died in 1851. He is credited for the creation of much of the family's wealth which he did during a period of 30 years while he was at the helm of affairs of the estate. He received his title of Raja Bahadur with his succession in continuation of the title given to his father. He continued his residence in the village of Banaili, and expanded the palace there during his tenure. He extended the Banaili Raj through acquisitions of estates that were located in the-then districts of Munger, Bhagalpur, Santhal Paraganas and Purnea. With these acquisitions, the size of the Banaili estate expanded around four to five times during his reign. He was interested in wrestling and sponsored many wrestling competitions in which he also took part. He also wrote a book on Ayurveda named "Bedanand Vinod".
Raja Bahadur Lilanand Sinha.
His son, Raja Bahadur Lilanand Sinha, maintained the family's eminence and was famous in the entire region for his piety and benevolence. Many stories of his charity and kindness still abound in the Mithila region. He was also responsible for shifting the family's residence from Banaili which had then become a hotbed for malaria to Ramnagar in Purnia district. He again shifted his residence from Ramnagar to Champanagar, 22 km from Purnia town in Bihar leaving his eldest son, Raja Bahadur Padmanand Singh to continue to stay in Ramnagar. The deorhi in Ramnagar still survives but is no longer in the state it once was.
Raja Bahadur Kalanand Sinha.
Raja Lilanand Singh had two sons from his third wife - Raja Kalanand Sinha and Raja Bahadur Kirtyanand Sinha (Raja Padmanand Singh being the eldest born of his second wife). The former shifted after the death of his father to a new Deorhi he built in Garh Banaili Purnia district, which was famous for its beauty and perhaps the most exquisite of the residences built by the Banaili family. The deorhi has not survived with his successors bringing the edifice down after India's independence.
Raja Kalanand Singh is listed in the official directory of the Coronation Durbar of 1911 as one of those attending the ceremonies. [http://www.archive.org/stream/coronationdurbar030742mbp/coronationdurbar030742mbp_djvu.txt]
Raja Bahadur Kirtyanand Sinha.
The more prominent and better educated son of Raja Lilanand Singh was Raja Bahadur Kirtyanand Singh. He was a Bachelor of Arts from Allahabad University and was famous for his many pursuits - shikaar (hunting), Polo - as well for the role he played in the contemporary public life. He wrote three books - Purnea, a Shikarland; Shikar in Hills and Jungles; and Homeopathic Practice [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Kirtyanand%20Sinha].
He made a contribution to the establishment of T.N.B College in Bhagalpur which was in need of funds having been established in 1880s. The Raja made a contribution of "60 acres of land and 600,000 of rupees in Cash for the construction of building and other developmental work". [http://www.tnbcollege.org/collegehistory.aspx] For this contribution and other acts of charity, he was awarded the title of ""Raja"" in June 1914.
On 9 July 1917, he was appointed as a government nominee to the Champaran Agrarian Committee which had been set up to resolve the issue of indigo planters in Champaran following the famous Champaran Satyagraha Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha by Mahatma Gandhi. In this committee, he worked with Mahatma Gandhi, and for his work in the Committee he was awarded the title of ""Raja Bahadur"" in 1919.
On the request and appeal made by Sri Braj Mohan Thakur, Raja Bahadur Krityanand Singh along with Raja Tank Nath Choudhary created separately a chair of Maithili in Calcutta University [http://www.bmtlawcollege.org/about1.html]. This went a long way in advancing maithili as a language.
He was one of the founders of the Bank of Bihar, which survives even now as the Bihar State Cooperative Bank Limited[http://biharbank.bih.nic.in/]. He also started a Banaili Iron and Steel Works in Sitarampur in Asansol, referred to in the book on Indian Economy written by eminent historian Amiya Kumar Bagchi and also in a book "Bihar" published by the National Book Trust. This venture, unfortunately, as the noted historian Amiya Kumar Bagchi observes, did not survive the "Great Depression".
The Raja, along with Maharaja of Darbhanga Maharaja of Darbhanga#cite note-56, hosted the first flight expedition over the Mount Everest in 1933 Maharaja of Darbhanga#cite note-56. "The Raja of Banaili, a cheery personality, who had shot over hundred tigers, offered us his fleet of motor-cars, remarking that, if possible, he would like to retain one or two of his own. He had seventeen. He seemed astonished, as if at an unusual display of moderation, when only three cars and a lorry were required." (Quoted in Everest - The Mountaineering History by Walt Unsworth from First Over Everest, The Houston-Mount Everest Expedition 1993 by Air Commodore PFM Fellowes et al.).
The Raja is credited for issuing the first official state invitation to the great maestro duo of Ustad Salamat & Nazakat Ali Khan of the Sham Chaurasia gharana in 1934. Ustad Salamat Ali Khan was then 11 years old and Nazakat Ali Khan 13 years They were invited to perform at the Dussehra festival in Champanagar Deorhi (Palace) and the royal host liked their rendition of Malkauns so much that he would not let them leave Champanagr [http://www.virsaonline.com/Articles/Articles%2004.htm. The duo stayed under the patronage of the Raja for a few months, and some believe that their Basant Bahar composition ""Des des ki thi jung dushman sab har gaye"" is in the praise of the Raja.[http://www.esnips.com/doc/bf1be9bf-486c-4617-af9c-4bcfaeb21f1b/Salamat-Ali-Khan---Age-11---Basant-Bahar---Des-Des-Ki-Thi-Jung]
Another great musician, Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja, served as a court musician in the darbar of the Raja. Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan also gave music lessons to Raja's eldest son, Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha [http://dilrang.dalalexports.com/altaf.html].
Raja Bahadur Kirtyanand Sinha stayed in public life until his death in 1938. His place of residence remained the Champanagar Deorhi in Purnia inherited from his father. This Deorhi has remained the most enduring of the deorhis of Banaili Raj and to this day is inhabited by the descendants of the Raja.
there is a hathi named sanat he also belongs to the same family
Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha.
Raja Bahadur Kirtyanand Sinha had six sons and three daughters. But, the most prominent of his six sons was Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha. He had many pursuits such as Shikar and in particular Billiards, where he won Bihar Championship in Billiards many times.
However, he is remembered mainly for his extraordinary talent in hindustani classical music. He was not only blessed with a gifted voice but had tremendous natural ability to bring ""pran"" in ragas that made them come alive in a most pleasing manner. He belonged to the old school of Hindustani classical music and believed in maintaining purity and spontaneity in performance. His rendition of ragas was an absolute delight and mesmerised the listeners transferring the singer's sense of ecstasy to the audience in a way that very few have managed to this day.
Along with his singing prowess, his legendary voice made a tremendous mark on one and all who came in touch with him. This included some great contemporary singers like Kesarbai Kerkar. Kesarbai, who was visiting Champanagar for a performance was so enthused by his rendition of ""Dwarikanath Sharan Me Teri"" that she insisted politely that he teach the song to her. She even expressed her readiness to make him her Guru for this song.
Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha believed that singing was the highest form of devotion and this reflected in his performances. President Zakir Hussain, once when he was Governor of Bihar, was so moved by his performance that he embraced him stating that the Rajkumar's singing was like praying to the almighty. Gajendra narayan Singh in his book has written that "Kumar Shyamanand Singh of Banaili estate had such expertise in singing that many great singers including Kesarbai were convinced about his prowess in singing.In case you cannot believe this please ask Pandit Jasraj. After listening to Bandishes from Kumar Saheb, Jasraj was moved to tears and lamented that alas! if he could have such ability himself"(free translation of Hindi text). Vilayat Hussain Khan in his book "Sangeetangyon ke Sansmaran" has written: "There is no better connoisseur and cognoscente of music in Bihar than Kumar Shyamanand Singh"(free translation of Hindi text).
Though Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha learned from many eminent names, his acknowledged Guru was the legendary Vishmadev Chattopadyay of Kolkata, who had learnt music from Badal Khan and Faiyaz Khan of Agra Gharana. Shyamanand Sinha learnt from Vishmadev Chattopadyay from 1936-39. After Vishmadev Chattopadyay left for Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha continued his music lessons, at the advice of his guru, from Bachu Khan Sahib of Agra (from 1940-1962-63). Other eminent singers from whom he obtained music lessons were Muzzaffar Khan, Mubarak Ali Khan, Bholanath Bhatt, Kedarjee, Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja, Mahaveer Mullick, and Jaduveer Mullick.
He shunned music as a profession and never sought public recognition. He gave very few public performances, most of his performances being during impromptu baithaks at his residence in Chamapanagar in the presence of his admirers and disciples. Despite his reluctance for public acknowledgement, his followers conferred him with the title of Sangeet Bhaskar and Sangeet Sudhakar for his mastery in classical singing.
He was also a great patron of classical music. He was one of the chief patrons of the All India Music Conference and presented the convocation address at the 11th All India Music Conference of The Prayag Sangit Samiti at Allahabadh on 19 December 1948. He used his great wealth to open the purse strings of patronage to many maestros of Hindustani Classical Music of his time at his residence in Champanagar, turning it into a place of learning and development of classical music. Salamat Ali Khan, Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja and Bachu Khan Sahib and many others were provided residence and patronage in Champanagar. He also invited many great maestros for performances, among them were "Aftab -e- Maushiqi" Faiyaz Khan, D. V. Paluskar, Kesarbai Kerkar, Sawai Gandharva, Vilayat Hussain Khan, Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja, Pandit Jasraj, Narayanrao Vyas, Basavaraj Rajguru, and Salamat Ali Khan and Nazakat Ali Khan.[http://www.myurdunews.com/?display_news=1759]
Unfortunately, the few professional recordings done by All India Radio in the latter part of his life are untraceable. Only a few amateur recordings of his singing are available with his family members and friends. These are rare treasures and absolute delight for the senses. They have somehow survived his idiosyncratic hatred for recording largely due to the efforts of his disciple nephew Kumar Girijanand Singh. Unfortunately, the excellence of his singing tradition did not survive his death though his influence stayed with some of his disciples who are striving hard to keep the flame burning in Purnia.

Japanese minelayer Tsugaru

Building.
Under the "Maru-3" Supplementary Naval Expansion Budget of 1937, a new large minelayer incorporating design improvements realized through operational experience with was funded. In addition to carrying 600 Type 6 naval mines, the new ship was equipped with an aircraft catapult, and carried a Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance seaplane. Physically very similar to "Okinoshima" in size, appearance and layout, its main armament was changed to four 127 mm Type 89 dual purpose guns, intended to give "Tsugaru" better AA capabilities than its predecessor.
"Tsugaru" was launched by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on June 5, 1940, and was commissioned into service on October 22, 1941.
Operational history.
After commissioning, "Tsugaru" was assigned to Admiral Kiyohide Shima’s Mine Division 19 under Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue’s IJN 4th Fleet and was forward deployed to Saipan. 
At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, "Tsugaru" was assigned to support the invasion of Guam. Following the success of this mission, in January 1942, "Tsugaru" deployed from Jaluit together with "Okinoshima", under the overall command of Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka to participate in “Operation R” (the invasion of Rabaul and Kavieng).
On 5 March, "Tsugaru" and "Okinoshima", under the overall command of Admiral Kuninori Marumo, were assigned to “Operation SR” (the invasion of Lae and Salamaua in New Guinea). On 10 March, the invasion force was attacked by ninety United States Navy aircraft from and with "Tsugaru" suffering light damage.
On 4 May "Tsugaru" was assigned to Admiral Shima’s Tulagi invasion force, which was part of “Operation Mo” (the invasion of Tulagi and Port Moresby in New Guinea). However, the invasion plans were cancelled after the Battle of the Coral Sea and "Tsugaru" was assigned instead to “Operation RY” (the invasion of Nauru and Ocean Island). This operation was also cancelled after the loss of "Okinoshima" on 12 May 1942, and "Tsugaru" was stationed at Rabaul.
On 14 July, "Tsugaru" was reassigned to Admiral Gunichi Mikawa’s IJN 8th Fleet, and supported “Operation RI” (the invasion of Buna in New Guinea). Subsequently in August and September, "Tsugaru" was used on missions to supply reinforcements and equipment to Guadalcanal, and was hit by bombs from USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers on 3 September, with 14 crewmen killed and 30 wounded. After repairs, she continued making transport runs to Guadalcanal, Shortland Island, New Georgia and Santa Isabel Island in the Solomon Islands to the end of February 1943.
From March–May 1943, "Tsugaru" underwent repairs and refit at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, returning to Rabaul in early August. However, en route to Rabaul, she was attacked by , on 5 August, NNE of Rabaul, with one torpedo hit. The damage was enough to warrant an immediate return to Truk for emergency repairs, and a return to Yokosuka by mid-September, where she remained to the end of the year.
On 1 December 1943, "Tsugaru" was reassigned to the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet. On 24 March 1944, she deployed from Palau to mine the Balabac Strait in the Philippines, after which she was stationed at Balikpapan in Borneo. One of the mines from this mission is credited with sinking the , in July 1944. On 31 May, "Tsugaru" was assigned to “Operation KON” (the Relief of Biak), transporting reinforcements from Zamboanga on Mindanao in an effort to counter the American landings. On 21 June, after departing Sorong, New Guinea for Halmahera Island, "Tsugaru" was torpedoed by the Royal Dutch Navy submarine "K-XIV", which caused severe damage. After temporary repairs, she attempted to reach Manila, but was sighted on 29 June near Biak by , which fired a full spread of six torpedoes. Two hit "Tsugaru", which sank at position less than 25 minutes later with loss of most of her crew, including her CO, Captain Nakatsu.
"Tsugaru" was removed from the navy list on 10 August 1944.

MIM-46 Mauler

The General Dynamics MIM-46 Mauler was a self-propelled anti-aircraft missile system designed to a late 1950s US Army requirement for a system to combat low-flying high-performance tactical fighters and short-range ballistic missiles. Based on the M113 chassis, Mauler carried search and attack radars, fire control computers and nine missiles in a highly mobile platform. An ambitious design for its era, the Mauler ran into intractable problems during development, and was eventually canceled in November 1965.
Mauler's cancellation left the US Army with no modern anti-aircraft weapon, and they rushed development of the much simpler MIM-72 Chaparral and M163 VADS to fill this niche. These weapons were much less capable than Mauler, and were intended solely as a stop-gap solution until more capable vehicles were developed. In spite of this, no real replacement entered service until the late 1990s. Both the US Navy and British Army were also expecting Mauler to fulfil their own short-range needs and its cancellation left them with the same problem. They used RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and Rapier missile, respectively, to fill these needs.
Background.
Duster and Vigilante.
The US Army's first custom-designed anti-aircraft weapon was the M42 Duster, mounting two Bofors 40 mm guns in an optically aimed turret on a M41 Walker Bulldog light tank chassis. First entering production in 1952, the Duster quickly became outdated as aircraft performance increased.
To replace the Duster, the Army started work on the Sperry Vigilante, which mounted a powerful 37 mm Gatling gun on top of a modified M113 Armored Personnel Carrier chassis. Although the Vigilante was, like the Duster, optically aimed and guided, its 3,000 rpm firing rate gave it much better performance against high-speed aircraft. 
As the Vigilante program continued, the Army decided that any gun-based system was hopeless as speeds increased and engagement times dropped. The Vigilante had a maximum effective range of about , and its shells took about 5 seconds to cross this distance. A jet aircraft flying at would cover over a kilometer during those 5 seconds. By the time a radar-assisted sighting system could develop a firing solution, the target would be out of range.
Given their doubts in the new system, the Army decided to cancel the Vigilante and keep the Duster in service until a much more capable all-missile system arrived to replace it.
FAAD.
Under the "Forward Area Air Defense" (FAAD) project, the Army began collecting theoretical data on the requirements for a missile-based system in 1959.
Guidance was a major area of concern. Most anti-aircraft missiles of the era use semi-active radar homing (SARH), with an "illumination radar" on the ground that reflected signals off the target that were picked up by a small receiver in the missile's nose. This system had the advantage that the radar signal continued to grow in strength as the missile approached the target, making it increasingly easy to track. More importantly, the reflected signal was a cone shape centered on the target, so guidance became increasingly accurate as the missile approached.
On the downside, the SARH concept also meant that any other reflections could confuse the missile's seeker. Since SARH relied on making the seeker in the missile as simple as possible in order to fit into the missile body, it was common for seekers of the era to be easily confused by reflections from trees, buildings or the ground. It was difficult for the missile to distinguish the target in a cluttered environment.
For FAAD, they decided to use a beam riding guidance system. This had been used in early missiles like the RIM-2 Terrier, but had been abandoned in favor of semi-active systems for all of the reasons above. In particular, in the case of beam-riding the signal is shaped like a cone centered on the broadcaster, which means it becomes increasingly "inaccurate" as the missile flies towards the target. Some sort of secondary terminal guidance system was almost always needed with beam-riding weapons.
In spite of these disadvantages, beam-riding offered FAAD the ability to guide the missiles in close proximity to the ground. Since the guidance signal is received at the rear of the missile body, the signal would remain clear as long as there were no obstructions between the missile and launcher. It was only the launch platform that had to have the ability to distinguish targets from ground clutter, not the missile. FAAD used a continuous wave radar, which uses the Doppler shift of the moving targets to locate them against any sort of background. For terminal guidance, FAAD used an advanced infrared homing system.
Given the quick engagement times, on the order of seconds, the Army decided that FAAD had to have semi-automatic actions. In combat, the operators would select targets on a long-range search radar and then simply say "go" to attack them. The system's fire control computer would slew the weapons and fire automatically as soon as they came in range.
After running Monte Carlo simulations on an IBM 650, they decided to use a blast-fragmentation warhead, deciding that the continuous-rod warhead would be less effective.
For mobility, the system would be based on the M113, the Army's latest APC and one of the more advanced vehicles in the inventory. The modifications needed to support a missile system were relatively simple, and the crew area inside the chassis offered room for the needed equipment. The resulting vehicle was known as the XM-546.
Development.
Several companies responded to the FAAD contract tender, which General Dynamics (Convair Pomona Division) won in 1959. In 1960 the project was given the official name "Mauler". 
The Army was not the only potential user of the Mauler system; both the British Army and US Navy planned on using Mauler for their own needs. The British Army's intended role was essentially identical to the US's, but the Navy was looking for a solution to the problem of air attack against their capital ships both by high-speed aircraft as well as early (non-skimming) anti-shipping missiles. Starting in 1960 they had developed a program for a "Basic Point Defense Missile System" (BPDMS), and intended to use a modified version of the Mauler, the "RIM-46A Sea Mauler", to fill this role. Mauler's beam riding system made it preferable to other missile systems because it would have less problems with clutter from the sea. Additionally, its fast-acting semi-automatic fire control was highly desired for a weapon that was expected to counter targets with engagement times under a minute. Expecting its arrival, the Navy's latest destroyer escorts, the Knox class frigate, were built with space reserved for the Sea Mauler launchers when they arrived.
Development of the missile airframe and engine progressed rapidly. Unguided examples, known as "Launch Test Vehicles", started firing tests in September 1961. These were quickly followed by the "Control Test Vehicle" (CTV) guided examples in 1961, which flew simple paths to test the aerodynamic controls. Both test series demonstrated a variety of problems, including failures of the rocket casings, and excessive drag and wing flutter.
The first "Guidance Test Vehicle" (GTV), essentially the service prototypes, started firing in June 1963. These also demonstrated an array of problems, most worrying was the continued tendency to lose guidance instructions immediately after launch. Additionally, when mounted in the 3 by 3 box launcher, the missiles would break their containers and damage the missiles in adjacent containers. Eventually no less than 22 different container materials would be used in an attempt to find a suitable solution.
Cancellation.
By this point there were serious doubts that the system would be entering service any time soon. On 16 September 1963 the Army Materiel Command asked the Aviation and Missile Command to study adapting the Navy's AIM-9 Sidewinder missile as the basis of a short-range anti-aircraft system. They suggested that the conversion would be simple, but the missile's long lock-on time and optical guidance would make it ineffective in close combat.
Based on this potential solution to the air defense problem, the Army Staff, supported by the Army Air Defense Artillery School at Fort Bliss, started a new study under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Edward Hirsch. Known as the "Interim Field Army Air Defense Study" (IFAADS), it called for a multi-layer system consisting of an adapted Sidewinder as a missile component known as the MIM-72 Chaparral, a short-range gun component using the M61 Vulcan known as the M163 VADS, and the separate AN/MPQ-49 Forward Area Alerting Radar that would support both by sending digital information to displays in those platforms. All of these would be further supported by the FIM-43 Redeye man-portable missile. Although the resulting composite system would not be nearly as capable as Mauler, it could be in service much sooner and provide some cover while a more capable system developed.
In November 1963 Mauler was re-directed as a pure technology demonstration program. Several modified versions using simpler systems were proposed, but even these would not have entered service before 1969. Tests with the GTV's continued until the entire program was cancelled outright in November 1965. Chaparral adapted the Mauler's IR seeker, which was greatly improved over the versions in the original AIM-9C.
Aftermath.
The Chaparral/Vulcan combination was always intended to be a stop-gap solution while a more powerful system evolved. However, in the 1970s the threat was perceived to change from tactical aircraft to missile-firing helicopters that would "pop-up" from behind cover. This suggested the use of a fast-acting gun system, albeit one with much longer range than the Vulcan's 1,200 m. Out of these studies came the "Division Air Defense" concept that was eventually filled by the M247 Sergeant York. This program ran into serious technical problems of its own, and was eventually cancelled in 1985.
After the Sergeant York was cancelled, the Army joined forces with the Canadian Forces to develop a new system. The result was the Oerlikon Contraves-designed built-in-Canada ADATS, which is extremely similar to the original Mauler in form, function and even the launch platform, an adapted M113. ADATS is somewhat more capable than Mauler, however, with ranges up to 10 km and higher speeds. However, the ending of the Cold War led the Army to cancel their ADATS purchase, leaving Chaparral/Vulcan in service even longer. The anti-aircraft role was eventually filled by the Bradley Linebacker, based on the short-range FIM-92 Stinger.
The cancellation also left the British Army without a defense system, but they had prepared for this eventuality, having had several US missile systems cancelled out from under them in the past. Before selecting the Mauler, the British Aircraft Corporation had been working on a private project known as "Sightline", and continued its development as a low priority while the Mauler program progressed. On its cancellation, Sightline was given full development funds, and entered service in 1971 as Rapier.
The US Navy was in a somewhat more troubling position. In addition to their need to replace guns and existing missile systems like the RIM-24 Tartar, they were also looking to replace short-range gun systems on their older ships. Mauler was "built-in" not only to their latest ship designs, like the Knox, but formed the basis for their entire anti-aircraft concept for the 1970s. It was believed that Mauler would greatly improve the capabilities of smaller ships, allowing them to take on some of the roles that would normally require a much larger platform, like a full destroyer.
With Mauler's cancellation, the Navy had to start a crash program to develop a suitable system. As the infrared-guided Sidewinder would be of limited use against aircraft or missiles approaching head-on, they were forced to use the AIM-7 Sparrow instead. Although the Sparrow was a capable missile, it was intended for launch from high-speed aircraft and thus had relatively low acceleration, trading this for longer cruising time and range. An entirely new motor was developed for the new "Sea Sparrow". To guide it, a new manually controlled radar illuminator was developed, guided by an aimer standing between two large radar dishes that looked somewhat like searchlights. The ship's search radars would send target information via voice channels to the operator, who would slew the illuminators onto the target and launch the missiles. The missiles were held in a large eight-cell rotating launcher than was slaved to the illuminator in order to allow the seeker to see the reflected signal. The system, as a whole, was much larger than Mauler, had shorter range, and much longer reaction times.
In spite of the Sea Sparrow's relative simplicity, it was quickly upgraded. The use of folding mid-mounted wings allowed the launcher cells to be greatly reduced in size, and an automatic tracking system was soon added to the radar illuminator system. This was again upgraded to allow the phased-array radars of modern ships to guide the Sparrow directly, removing the need for the relatively large illuminators. The evolution continued with the latest models, which can be vertically launched from four-cell containers, greatly expanding the number that can be carried on most ships. What started as a quick-and-dirty solution to the hole left by the Mauler evolved into a system of even greater capability.
Description.
The General Dynamics Mauler system used a large A-frame mounted on the top of the vehicle that contained a phased array continuous wave search radar at the top, the smaller tracking/illumination radar on one side, and a large box containing nine missiles between the "legs". The entire system was mounted at the back of the XM546 "Tracked Fire Unit" on a rotating platform that allowed the missiles to be pointed toward the target. Before launch the protective cover over the missile's canister was popped off to allow the infrared seeker to see the target, and then it was launched into the illuminating radar's beam.
Raytheon provided both the search and illumination radars, while Burroughs provided the fire control system. The missile itself was long, in diameter, had a fin span, and weighed . It had a maximum range of and ceiling of , powered by a Lockheed solid-fuel motor of .

The Deutsch-Französisches Institut (DFI) is an independent non-profit organization devoted to research on and documentation of contemporary Franco-German relations.
The institute is funded by the German Foreign Office, the regional government of Baden-Württemberg and the town of Ludwigsburg. Projects are also funded by external partners.
History.
The Institute was established in 1948, with the aim of promoting Franco-German cooperation in all areas of public life and academia. It is based in Ludwigsburg, a Paris office being opened in 2004. In 1990 the Frankreich-Bibliothek, a library and documentation centre, was opened in Ludwigsburg. 
Founder members of the dfi included prominent figures such as Joseph Rovan and Alfred Grosser, on the French side, and the Germans Theodor Heuss and Carlo Schmid. The first director was Fritz Schenk (1948-1972), followed by Robert Picht (1972-2002) and Frank Baasner (2002- ). The titular head of the Institute is the President, currently the former prime minister of Baden Württemberg, Erwin Teufel. 
The Institute currently has approximately 20 members of staff, including 5 researchers.
Profile and activities.
The dfi conducts applied research and provides consultancy on social, political and economic developments in France and on topics relating to Franco-German relations. The core research areas of economic policy, social policy, European policy, and intercultural communication form the focus of its activities, which are mainly long-term projects, partially or wholly funded by external financing from foundations or businesses. With the aim of promoting links between research and practice, the dfi hosts conferences and seminars, publishes extensively, and provides background information for the media.
In addition to this, the Institute holds seminars and training sessions for various groups. Participants include journalists and students from France and Germany. The research staff also teach at German and foreign universities.
The Institute’s activities are chiefly directed at decision makers and those occupying positions of influence in politics, business, education and the media, but also at the German and French public.

David Andrew Miller (born 10 June 1989) is a South African cricketer. He is a left-handed batsman and a right-arm slow bowler who plays domestic cricket for Dolphins and has represented South Africa in both One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals.
Domestic career.
Miller made his first-class debut in the Dolphins' final game of the 2007–08 domestic SuperSport Series, scoring a half-century in the first innings in which he batted.
Miller made eight appearances in the one-day MTN Domestic Championship competition of the same season, though his final match was abandoned after just three overs. Miller scored an average of 13 runs throughout the competition, which saw the Dolphins finish in fifth place in the league.
Miller played two matches in the Pro20 Series Twenty20 competition for the Dolphins, who finished as defeated finalists in the competition. He now plays for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League and Chittagong Kings in the Bangladesh Premier League. On 6th May 2013, Miller hit the 3rd fastest IPL century (101 not out off 38 balls) against Royal Challengers Bangalore. The opposing captain Virat Kohli, who dropped one of his catch on while Miller was on 41, said of the innings that, "It was one of the best innings that has ever been seen in the Indian Premier League".
International career.
Miller earned his national call-up in May 2010 after a series for South Africa A against Bangladesh A, where he ended as the second-highest run-scorer.Miller made his Twenty20 International debut for South Africa on 20 May 2010 against the West Indies in Antigua. Miller, called up to replace the injured Jacques Kallis, dispatched the sixth ball of his innings for six and went on to top score as South Africa won by just 1 run. Two days later Miller made his ODI debut, also against the West Indies. He put in another good performance, scoring 23 not out and helping South Africa to victory. Miller was selected to play in Zimbabwe's tour of South Africa, during which he contributed in both ODI and T20 formats towards a resounding victory by the South Africans. He was then selected for the squad to play Pakistan in the U.A.E. during October and November 2010. He played in two ODI series, against West Indies and Pakistan, before being named in South Africa preliminary 2011 World Cup squad.

Jeaffreson Greswell

Air Commodore Jeaffreson Herbert Greswell CB CBE DSO DFC RAF (28 July 1916 – 19 November 2000) was a British pilot during World War II and a senior Royal Air Force officer in the post-war years.
As an Air Commodore, Greswell served as the eleventh Commandant Royal Observer Corps between June 1964 and June 1968.
Service history.
Greswell joined the RAF in 1935 and served for over thirty years. Much of his war time service was spent with Coastal Command operating on convoy protection duties. Initially flying Ansons with No. 217 Squadron RAF and later in Wellingtons, promoted to Squadron Leader with No. 172 Squadron RAF. He was heavily involved in the development and testing of the 'Leigh Light' illumination system used effectively in the war against the U-boat menace. On the first serious test of the system in 1942, a Wellington piloted by Greswell, located two U-boats and seriously damaged both with depth charges and machinegun fire. 
On his return from a detachment in the United States, where he had overseen American manufacturers on the fitting of the Leigh Light system in Liberators and trained aircrew in its use, he was promoted to Wing Commander and posted to No. 179 Squadron RAF in Gibraltar. Under his command 179 Squadron became one of the most effective anti-submarine units in the Mediterranean theatre, credited with the destruction of eight U-boats.
At the end of the war Greswell was placed on the reserve list of RAF officers. Upon recall in the 1950s he was promoted to Group Captain and his post war appointments included involvement in the air support planning for the British forces landings in Egypt during the Suez crisis in 1956, and later the restructuring of the combined NATO air forces anti-submarine planning.
Royal Observer Corps.
On promotion to Air Commodore rank in June 1964, Greswell was appointed as the 11th Commandant of the ROC during a period which saw the greatest reorganisation and upheaval in the organisation’s history, with its role and funding being greatly reduced. The aircraft reporting role was finally phased out, more than six hundred Posts were closed, and the overall establishment reduced down to some twelve thousand observers.
To continue his efforts in protecting the continued existence of the ROC Greswell requested that the normal tenure as Commandant be extended beyond the normal two years. He eventually handed control of the ROC to Air Commodore Rixon in June 1968, having held the post for four years. It was Greswell’s final RAF appointment and he retired from HM Forces.

Hybrid (DC Comics)

The Hybrid are a fictional group of supervillains appearing in DC Comics. Their first appearance as a group was in "New Teen Titans" vol. 2, #24, which was marketed in October 1986. The issue was written by Marv Wolfman and illustrated by Eduardo Barreto, with inks by Romeo Tanghal.
Fictional group history.
Left insane by the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Mento believed it was his destiny to recreate his old team, the Doom Patrol. Gathering people who'd suffered bizarre accidents—some possibly caused by him—Mento experimented on them with the artificial compound Promethium, turning many of them into superhuman freaks. Under Mento's influence, the Hybrid were set to fight the New Teen Titans, in order to kill Mento's adopted son Changeling, a fellow surviving Patroller whom Mento blamed for the death of the original team. Eventually dissuaded after several conflicts, they left Mento to fight alone. After his defeat at the hands of the Titan Raven, Hybrid took him with them as they harbored at his estate.
The Hybrid were briefly seen much later in issue 87 of the "New Teen Titans", shown still living on the Dayton estate, Harpi moping about having to isolate themselves from normal society. This was supposed to be the beginning of a storyline that would have led to the Hybrid having a spin-off series in 1993; however, matters such as questions on royalties appeared before too much was planned, and the proposed series was shelved.
Later, members of the group joined battles at "The House", a fight club organized by Roulette where all but Pteradon seem to have died as only he is not displayed on the wall commemorating "Fallen Players of the House." One month after this issue was released however Touch-n-Go and Scirocco showed up in "Wonder Woman" Vol. 2, issue 175 as two of many female villains causing mayhem in New York City. The chronological reading order of these two issues is not certain.
Since this last appearance, the history of the Doom Patrol was retconned by the events of The Infinite Crisis, resurrecting the original Doom Patrol and largely restoring them to their original forms and mentalities, including Mento. How or if this affects the Hybrid has not yet been shown.

Kate McPhelim Cleary

Kate McPhelim Cleary (August 22, 1863 – July 16, 1905) was a 19th-century American author.
Biography.
Kate McPhelim was born in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Canada, the daughter of Irish immigrants James McPhelim and Margaret Kelly. Kate’s father died when she was two years old, leaving her mother Margaret Kelly McPhelim to raise her four children alone. After a brief return to Ireland to live with relatives, financial hardships forced the family to emigrate to Philadelphia. Kate published her first poem at the age of 14, and her first short story by the age of 15. During this time, all four of the McPhelim children turned to writing stories, poems and articles for such publications as "The Chicago Tribune" and Philadelphia’s "Saturday Night" as a source of income for the family.
Two years later in 1880, Kate’s family moved to Chicago, where Kate married Chicago businessman Michael Timothy Cleary in 1884. That same year Kate and her mother both relocated to Nebraska, where Michael Cleary had established a lumber business in partnership with his brother-in-law John Templeton. Between the years of 1887 and 1894, Kate gave birth to five children (James, Marguerite, Gerald, Rosemarie and Vera). Kate’s mother died of pneumonia in 1893, and in 1894 Kate’s life was threatened by a fever following the birth of her youngest daughter, Vera. In that same year, Kate’s daughter Marguerite died of typhoid fever at the age of six. In 1895 Michael Cleary left temporarily for Chicago in an attempt to rescue his business, and during the next three years he traveled frequently in search of a better climate to alleviate his failing health. In 1895, Kate’s daughter Rosemarie died at the age of three. Two years later, Kate gave birth to another son (Edward) in 1897. In 1898 her husband sold the lumber business and moved the family to Chicago.
In 1902, Kate voluntarily entered a private sanitarium for an addiction to morphine. The following year she was admitted to the Illinois Northern Hospital for the Insane in Elgin, Illinois in order to recover from her morphine dependency. The hospital pronounced her “sane” in the spring of 1904. In 1905, her husband attempted to commit Kate involuntarily to an insane asylum, but his attempt was thwarted by a court battle in which a jury determined that Kate was sane. She died soon thereafter at the age of 41, succumbing to a heart condition she had endured most of her life.
Professional accomplishments.
In 1898, Kate McPhelim Cleary was named by "The Chicago Chronicle" as "One of the three leading women humorists in Chicago". Her short stories regularly appeared in such publications as "The Chicago Tribune", "Puck", "Belford's Monthly", "The Chicago Daily News", "McClure's", "Good Housekeeping", "Cosmopolitan", "St. Nicholas", and "The Youth's Companion". Her poem "Nebraska" was recited at the Chicago's World Fair of 1893. Her feminist novel "Like a Gallant Lady" was received favorably by the critical press, which compared her novel to the works of Hamlin Garland.

The Monorierdő train collision occurred on October 6, 2008, near Monorierdő, Hungary. A regular passenger train coming from Nyíregyháza collided with the Hajdú InterCity train, on its way from Debrecen to Budapest. At 10:20 am, the regular train's control car crashed into the last car of the Intercity train; its engine driver survived, because he ran back into the first car to warn the passengers when he realized the accident could not be avoided. The tragedy was caused by an error in the train control system.
Four travelers died as a result of the accident (three people on the site, and one of them in the hospital). 27 people were in need of additional hospital treatment. Pál Szabó, the traffic minister of Hungary offered his resignation shortly after the tragedy, and Miklós Kamarás, the president of MÁV (Hungarian State Railways Co.) did the same. Prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány accepted both, however, he didn't accept the resignation of István Heinczinger, CEO of MÁV.

Melanie Sisneros

Melanie Sisneros is an American bassist and a member of four bands: Crescent Shield, Whole Lotta Rosies (an all-female AC/DC tribute band), Hangar 18 (a Megadeth tribute band) and Mz Led (an all-female Led Zeppelin tribute band). She is also a former member of the bands Sinergy, The Iron Maidens and New Eden.
Biography.
Melanie Ann Sisneros was born the second of three daughters and raised in various towns in New Mexico. She graduated "cum laude" in Pomona College in Pomona, California, in 1994, majoring in Latin and Greek languages.
In early 1998, Sisneros and guitarist/vocalist William Rustrum formed a local band called Raven Mad. The band released two albums before disbanding on December 2000. She joined the heavy metal band New Eden on January 2001 and stayed with them for over a year.
On June 2000, Sisneros joined the Iron Maiden tribute band Wrathchild, where she took the stage name "Steve Heiress" (a female version of bassist Steve Harris). A year later, she and lead vocalist Jenny Warren co-founded The Iron Maidens ("World's Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden") with former Phantom Blue members Linda McDonald and Josephine Draven and former Bandit member Sara Marsh. Her stay with the band lasted a year before leaving both the Maidens and New Eden to join the Finland-based power metal band Sinergy.

Maynardville Open-Air Theatre

The Maynardville Open-Air Theater is an outdoor theatre in Maynardville Park, Wynberg, Cape Town, South Africa. It seats 720 people and is known for its annual Shakespeare in the Park plays.
History.
Park grounds.
Before it was named Maynardville, the land where the park now sits was government ground, first administered by the Dutch East India Company and after 1795 by other British authorities.
In July 1807 two young officers of the Cape regiment, Lieut. Louis Ellert and Lieut. Ernst Egger, married two sisters named Gertruida and Catherina Baartman. Just prior to his marriage, Ellert was granted a piece of land adjacent to the camp, where he built a cottage named Rosendal. The uneven ground was levelled and cultivated by slaves on either side of a stream known as the Krakeelwater, which flowed through the small estate. For several years Ellert and his wife shared the house with her sister and husband until, in 1810, Egger decided to purchase a piece of ground adjacent to Rosendal for his own use. Ellert was later killed in the war on the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony, but because he had transferred ownership to his wife, the widow Ellert continued to manage her small farm after her husband's death.
Her brother-in-law was not so efficient in his farming operations and this, coupled with his extravagant life style, forced him into bankruptcy. His land was not lost to his family, however, because his sister-in law purchased his property. To do this and to support her large household, the widow Ellert took a bond on the property from a Cape Town businessman named James Mortimer Maynard. 
In 1836, Maynard took over Rosendal from the widow Ellert, who had become insolvent. He later bought another property from her to make up the site for his home, Maynard's Villa. Maynard died on 9 September 1874. As he failed to produce an heir, his estate went to his nephew, William Mortimer Maynard Farmer, who was already an established business man. 
Farmer married the daughter of Major Richard Wolfe, then resident magistrate and civil commissioner of Wynberg. Their daughter Enid married John Bernard, a major in the Royal Marines; they had two sons, Gerald and Brian. Enid Bernard died in 1949 and Maynardville was immediately sold to the Cape Town City Council, to be preserved as a public park. The historic but dilapidated homestead was later demolished by the municipal authorities in 1954.
Theatre.
The theatre had its origins in late 1949, when an influential Cape philanthropist, Margaret Molteno, submitted an application for municipal permission to convert the little-used park into an open-air theatre for ballet performances. She had been inspired by a recent visit to Regents Park Open-air Theatre in London, and intended to use the project as a means of funding schools and teacher-training colleges for underprivileged children on the Cape Flats. 
A successful approach to the then Mayor of Cape Town, Mr Abe Bloomberg, resulted in permission to use the premises. Mrs Molteno had the grounds overhauled, and facilitated the pro bono services of the Municipal Orchestra, Principal Dulcie Howes of the UCT Ballet School and Dean Erik Chisholm of the College of Music as conductor. The theatre officially began operation with the successful performances, in December 1950, of "Les Sylphides", "St Valentine's Night" and "Les Diversions". The money raised from this and later performances went to fund a pre-primary school in Athlone as well as the establishment of the Athlone Teachers’ Training College – the country's first college for coloured teachers of pre-school children. Unusually for South Africa at the time, Maynardville had also been successfully preserved as "Open to All" and free from segregation, a possible reason why the theatre's strongly anti-apartheid founders had chosen it in the first place.
In 1956, after six years of successful fund-raising ballet performances, Mrs Molteno approached the well-known South African actresses Cecilia Sonnenberg and Rene Ahrenson about establishing Shakespearean seasons. The actresses agreed to accept the project on her insistence, after having initially refused. With a new and renovated stage and raked auditorium, Rene and Cecelia persuaded Leslie French, an English stage and film actor, to come to Cape Town to direct and act in the theatre's first play, "The Taming of the Shrew", which opened the same year in 1956. 
In the ensuing years, the Shakespearean seasons grew into the immensely popular annual tradition of "Shakespeare-in-the-Park", which has made Maynardville famous. After decades of serving as the public face of the theatre, Cecilia and Rene retired in the mid-1990s, and most of the theatre's drama department closed when they left. However, the park still maintains its ballet performances and Shakespeare series through the Maynardville Theatre Trust, which was created after Cecilia retired.
The park today.
Maynardville has been designated as a "priority park" by the City of Cape Town, which means it has a development framework in place, spearheaded by the Maynardville Park Action Committee. This includes repairs to the facilities, incorporating the Wynberg library, creating a new gateway entrance, upgrading Rosendal Cottage, developing the historic avenue around Wolfe Street, and constructing a new pavilion.

A37 motorway (Netherlands)

The A37 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands. It is approximately 42 kilometers in length. The A37 is located entirely in the Dutch province Drenthe.
The A37 connects the city of Hoogeveen with Emmen and the German border (Twist, Germany) near Zwartemeer. At the border, the road continues as the German road B402, which connects to the German A31 a few kilometers east of the border.
Along the entire length of the motorway, the European route E233 follows the A37.
History.
Until 2003, the main connection between Hoogeveen and the German B402 road was the two-laned N37 highway. In that year, construction of the motorway finished on the section between interchanges Hoogeveen and Holsloot and that part of the road, now upgraded from 'N37' to 'A37', was opened to traffic. Since October 2007, the remaining stretch between Holsloot and the German border has also been upgraded from highway N37 to motorway A37.

Edmond La Beaume Cherbonnier

The Rev. Edmond La Beaume Cherbonnier (born February 11, 1918) is an American scholar in the field of religious studies, Professor ("Emeritus") of Religion, at Trinity College, and an Episcopal Church deacon. He is known for his work on Christianity analyzing idolatry and distinctions between mystical and biblical thought, his efforts on developing and advancing religious studies, and for founding the Religion Department at Trinity College in 1955.
Early life.
Edmond Cherbonnier was born on February 11, 1918, in Saint Louis, Missouri. His father, Edward Goodwin Cherbonnier, was a vice president of the Ralston Purina Company.
After graduation from St. Louis Country Day School, Cherbonnier entered Harvard University, where he majored in geology. In 1939, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts "cum laude". During his undergraduate years, when associated with Harvard’s Winthrop House, (one of twelve undergraduate residences) he was elected President of the Phillips Brooks House Association (a student-run public service organization). He was a member of the Winthrop House Committee and the Harvard Glee Club as well as an active participant for several years in social service work at the Phillips Brooks House Association.
Professional career.
Cherbonnier held a brief post as teacher of Latin at Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut. Shortly thereafter, Cherbonnier enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in New York; his graduate studies were interrupted while he served as a naval aviator during World War II. After his wartime service, he resumed his theological studies and in 1947 received the degree of Bachelor of Divinity from Union. In the same year he was ordained a deacon by the Episcopal Bishop of Missouri. Subsequent study on a Fiske Fellowship from Harvard led to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts (1948) and Master of Arts (1952) from Cambridge University, England. Additionally, from 1948-1949 Cherbonnier was in residence as a Union Seminary Traveling Fellow at the University of Strasbourg and the University of Zurich.
Cherbonnier entered the doctoral program at Columbia University; while studying during the 1949-1950 school year, Cherbonnier was a tutor-assistant to Henry P. Van Dusen at Union. He held a one-year appointment as assistant professor of religion at Vassar (1950–1951) which resulted in a Ph.D. degree in religion conferred by Columbia. His doctoral thesis was entitled "Freedom and Time: A Study in Some Recent Contributions to the Problem".
From Vassar, Cherbonnier joined the faculty of Barnard College of Columbia University, where he remained until the spring of 1955 as assistant and associate professor of religion. In addition, from 1952 to 1955 he served as Deacon at the nearby Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine, during the Deanship of the later controversial Bishop of California James A. Pike. On May 31, 1954, the New York Times highlighted one of his cathedral sermons in an article "Worship Of Ideals Held Destructive".
Cherbonnier received praise for his efforts early in his career. In 1952, Reinhold Niebuhr expressed gratitude to Cherbonnier in his Preface to "The Irony Of American History" "for careful reading of my manuscript and for many suggestions for its improvement".
In 1955, Cherbonnier’s book Hardness of Heart was published by Doubleday. A volume in the “Christian Faith Series” edited by Reinhold Niebuhr, the study provided a contemporary interpretation of the doctrine of sin. During the next year it was also published by London’s Victor Gollancz Ltd. Psychiatrist Karl Menninger, M.D. presented a synopsis of the book in his "The Vital Balance": “Cherbonnier in his beautiful essay, Hardness of Heart, describes the forms of idolatry indulged in by the hardhearted. He lists the hidden gods of cynicism as nationalism, humanism, phallicism, promiscuity, the glorification of money, and the various euphemisms such as frugality, shrewdness, and sound economy. Cherbonnier also lists iconoclasm, existentialist despair, and a so-called state of “adjustment” and “relatedness” toward which some psychiatrists are believed to steer their patients.”
In the fall of 1955, Cherbonnier was invited by Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, to establish a religion department. After serving two years as an associate professor, he was promoted to full professor and was then joined by a second department member, Dr. Theodor Marcus Mauch. Under Cherbonnier’s chairmanship, the department was enlarged to a staff of five full-time professors plus adjunct faculty.
Professor Cherbonnier was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity, honoris causa by the University of Vermont in 1959. He took a sabbatical leave in 1962-63 to London, England, which was partially underwritten by a Lilly Post-Doctoral Fellowship. He spent his sabbatical performing further work on distinctions between mystical and biblical thought. Dr. Cherbonnier took another leave for the 1970-1972 academic years plus the first semester of 1972-1973, which he also spent in England. He retired from his Trinity position in 1983.
Dr. Cherbonnier's interests include the Shroud of Turin and the life of Saint Joan of Arc (1412-1431 C.E.). He is presently a chaplain in the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem - Priory in the United States.
Works.
Many of Dr. Cherbonnier’s published writings, including Hardness of Heart, are accessible online. His papers were published in distinguished scholarly journals, such as the Harvard Theological Review, Commentary, Theology Today, Conservative Judaism, and the Journal of Religion. Additionally, he contributed essays to dictionaries as well as chapters to a number of books. His works include:

Rice Powell

Rice Powell was a Colonel in the Parliamentary army during the First English Civil War. In the Second English Civil War he allied himself with the Royalist cause. English Civil Wars. He fought in South Wales and played a significant part in events between 1642 and 1649 including a senior role during the Battle of St. Fagans.
Background.
His background is uncertain but he is probably the son of a Lewis Powell and is from South Pembrokeshire, first coming to notice for his service in Ireland prior to the start of what was to become the First English Civil War, playing a part in quelling an insurrection in Ireland which was presumably his first taste of military life.
English Civil War.
In 1642 and the start of the war he returned to Pembrokeshire, apparently still owed arrears of pay for his Irish service and joined with John Poyer and Rowland Laugharne in the defence of Pembroke Castle and offensive actions throughout Pembrokeshire. He was appointed governor of Cardigan Castle by Laugharne in 1644 as soon as it was captured and successfully defended it against a Royalist attack led by Sir Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield.
Rebellion.
In 1646 he was governor of Tenby Castle and by 1648 he was deputising for Laugharne when he was called to London and held command of all the forces in West Wales at the time of the order for supernumeraries to lay down their arms. Rice Powell followed John Poyer's lead and resisted this order, making a joint declaration in favour of the Royalist cause.
Apparently the rebels has been assured of Royalist support for their stance and at Carmarthen Powell's forces met those of Colonel Fleming and Colonel Horton, who attempted to bring Powell's force to battle near Llangathen resulting in a skirmish during which Fleming in retreat was shot and Horton was forced to withdraw as far as Brecon to resupply.
Powell now led his forces to seize Swansea, then Neath before advancing into the Vale of Glamorgan with Royalists rising in support en route, with Cardiff as their aim. 
Horton headed south from Brecon rapidly and caught Powell's force camped at St Fagans within view of Cardiff and drew them to battle at what became known as the Battle of St. Fagans in May 1648. Laugharne returned in time to retake command but was routed by Hortons force in a decisive victory.
Powell fled back to Pembrokeshire and Tenby castle where he was pursued and after a brief siege was persuaded to an unconditional surrender after which he was Court Martialed and sentenced to death.
In 1649 he was offered a Pardon and following the Restoration he was released. He last comes to notice in 1665 appealing to Charles II of England for payment of debts Powell accrued in the Royalist cause. There is no record of his debts being paid.

Battle of Bajaur (1519)

From 1515-1519, Zahir ud-Din Muhammad Babur enjoyed a relatively calm period when he returned to Kabul in the aftermath of his defeat at the Battle of Ghazdewan and loss of Transoxiana to the Uzbeks. But all that came to an end, when he had troubles with the Pashtuns who are various mountain tribes on either side of the current Pakistan-Afghanistan border, which had hitherto yielded an imperfect obedience or none to the throne of Kabul. The Pashtuns have never been subdued or conquered per se but only restrained. Baburs’ predecessors like Alexander the great, Mahmud Ghazni, Muhammad Ghori, Genghis Khan and Timur Lane all either managed to only restrain the Pashtuns for a while or did not bother them at all in order to avoid a bloody and needless confrontation. But Babur had no choice as he had to confront the people in his immediate territory.He too had to make alliances and give autonomy to the Pathans in order to maintain peace.
Battle.
Eventually he would come to battle in Bajaur in present day FATA or Federally Administered Tribal Areas, an autonomous territory in present day Pakistan next to the Afghanistan border. Thirty years before Babur’s invasion of Bajaur, the Yusufzai had settled in the lower parts of that tract expelling the Dilazaks the former inhabitants. This territory which lies at the southern roots of the Hindu Kush range and was highly cultivated, had in older times been held by the Jahangiri Sultans of Swat and Bajaur, (Chiefs of the today's old Swatis a predominant Pashtun tribe in Hazara Division), a race of princes whose authority appears at one time to have been very extensive especially among the rich cultivated valleys of that hill country. The dominions of the Sultan of Swat at one period had even extended to both sides of the Sind. The Yusufzai had succeeded in expelling the Dilazaks from part of the Swat territory and had also encroached upon the Sultan so that he had been compelled to retire into Upper Swat. The Sultan of Bajaur, Mir Haider Ali Gabri of the Jahangiri Dynasty was still independent. Babur when he entered the country was attended by several Dilazak chiefs who served him as guides and directed his vengeance against their deadly enemies the Yusufzai. He first marched against the strong Fort Gabar of Bajaur and the Sultan refusing to submit he attacked it with engines of war and with matchlocks which were quite new to the garrison. The alarm which these produced as soon as their effects were experienced was employed to cover an escalade that proved successful. The whole male inhabitants 3000 in number including their chiefs were cruelly put to the sword and a pillar erected of their heads. The women were taken as slaves. At this time the Sultan of Swat and the Yusufzais sent their envoys to appease Babur. After repeated hostilities they came to a final truce and agreement which was that they should make no inroads into Swat above Anuha; the amount of contribution which they had been accustomed to levy higher up being allowed as a deduction in the rolls of their revenue collections and that the Pashtuns who cultivated lands in Bajaur and Swat should pay six thousand loads about 38000 cwts of grain to the government.
Aftermath.
Part of the peace treaty included Babur’s marriage to Bibi Mubarka, daughter of Malik Shah Mansoor, one of the chiefs of the Yusufzai. It may be imagined that it was no easy task to restrain tribes which like those around Kabul had for ages been accustomed freely to indulge in robbery and insubordination of every kind and it should seem that hardly a year passed in which Babur did not make inroads into the country of someone or other of them to chastise their licentiousness to protect his more peaceable subjects and sometimes perhaps for the less laudable object of plundering them of their wealth or of reducing them to subjection.

Raw Striker

Raw Striker Ltd. (formerly Raw Engineering) is a kit car manufacturer established in 1999. In 2002 they acquired the rights to the Sylva Striker kit car, which they have since modified and on which the Fulcrum is based. It is based in Shelwick, just north of Hereford. In August 2010 the company was purchased by Callum and Jeremy Bulmer from the original owner Mel Coppock.
Cars.
Raw manufacture three models, which use very similar chassis and layout. The Striker, Fulcrum and Phoenix.
Striker.
The Striker can be bought as a self-build kit, or as a partly or fully built car.
The original Raw Striker was substantially the same as the Sylva Striker, with minor changes. It is a lightweight, spartan, sports car, with a FMR layout. There is a large range of suitable engines, though Raw themselves specialise in the Toyota 4AGE engine.
The Striker is a successful racing car with particular success in 750 Motor Club races. Additionally, there is a race series only for Strikers in Ireland and another single-make series is being launched by the 750 Motor Club for Raw Strikers.
Fulcrum.
The Raw Fulcrum was introduced in 2008 and is substantially the same car as the Striker. It has different bodywork without the open wings of the Striker. This closed bodywork improves aerodynamics significantly.
Phoenix.
The Raw Phoenix, the latest addition to the Raw range was originally designed as an aerodynamic enhancement for the Striker chassis. The Phoenix, a smooth lined retro styled full bodied car was added to the Raw range at the beginning of 2011 to complement the others in the range.
Dealers.

<doc id="19634168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19634168" title="Nuisance call">
Nuisance call

Nuisance calls encompass any type of unwanted, unsolicited, telephone call. Common types of nuisance calls include prank calls, telemarketing calls, and silent calls. Obscene phone calls and other threatening calls are criminal acts in most jurisdictions, particularly when hate crime is involved.
Unsolicited calls may also be used to initiate telephone frauds. Fax machines may also receive junk faxes via unsolicited calls.
Caller ID provides some protection against unwanted calls, but can still be turned off by the calling party. Even where end-user Caller ID is not available, calls are still logged, both in billing records at the originating telco and via automatic number identification, so the perpetrator's phone number can still be discovered in many cases. However, these do not provide complete protection: harassers can use payphones, in some cases, caller ID (but not necessarily automatic number identification itself) can be spoofed or blocked. Mobile telephone abusers can (at some cost) use "throwaway" mobile phones or SIMs. Voice over IP users may send bogus caller ID or route calls through servers in multiple countries.
Even in these cases, with sufficient law enforcement and telco effort, persistent abusers can often be tracked down by technical means. However recently wiretapping by law enforcement in many jurisdictions; especially in the United States has helped circumvent such disguise-like methods by the harasser. 
Call screening is another countermeasure against unsolicited calls.
Most telephone companies have a department devoted to handling complaints regarding unsolicited phone calls; in criminal cases such as obscene or threatening phone calls, many police departments have dedicated resources devoted to dealing with such cases.

Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple

Colonel The Rt Hon. Wilfrid William Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple, PC (13 September 1867 – 3 July 1939), was a British soldier and Conservative politician. He served as Minister of Transport between 1924 and 1929 under Stanley Baldwin.
Background and education.
Ashley was the son of Evelyn Ashley, second surviving son of the social reformer Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. His mother was Sybella Charlotte Farquhar, daughter of Sir Walter Farquhar, 3rd Baronet. William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple, was his great-uncle. He was educated at Harrow and Magdalen College, Oxford.
Political career.
Ashley, who held the rank of Colonel in the British Army, was well known as an activist in various pressure groups before commencing his party political career. He was a leading figure in the Navy League and also set up the anti-state intervention No More Waste Committee during the First World War. He was subsequently involved in the foundation of the Comrades of the Great War in 1917 and as President of the group helped to ensure that the ex-servicemen's movement was closely linked to the Conservative Party at its foundation.
Ashley was elected to parliament in 1906 to represent Blackpool, holding the seat until 1918 before subsequently sitting as member for Fylde until 1922 and New Forest from 1922 to 1932. He served under Andrew Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Parliamentary Secretary to the Office of Works from October 1922 until October 1923, when he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War, which he remained until January 1924. Ashley was sworn of the Privy Council in February 1924 and when the Conservatives returned to power under Baldwin in November of that year he was made Minister for Transport, an office he retained until the fall of the Baldwin administration in 1929. He left the House of Commons in 1932 and was raised to the peerage as Baron Mount Temple, of Lee in the County of Southampton, a revival of the title held by his great-uncle.
Lord Mount Temple remained active within the House of Lords and was a vocal supporter of the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany. He admired Adolf Hitler for his anti-communism, although much of his conviction rested on the belief that the Treaty of Versailles had been unjust to begin with and that it should be revised regardless of who was in government in Germany. In order to underline his support for the Germans Ashley was instrumental in establishing the Anglo-German Fellowship in 1935. He served as chairman of both this group and Anti-Socialist Union simultaneously in the later 1930s.
As AGF chairman, Lord Mount Temple (as he now was) visited Germany in mid 1937 and held a meeting with Hitler. However, unlike some of his contemporaries in the Fellowship, the laissez-faire capitalist Mount Temple did not support ideological Nazism (perhaps due in part to the fact that his wife was Jewish) and he resigned in protest from the chairmanship in the aftermath of Kristallnacht, although his membership of the group continued.
Personal life.
Lord Mount Temple married Amalia Mary Maud Cassel, daughter and only child of financier Sir Ernest Cassel, in early January, 1901. Amongst the wedding guests was The Prince Albert Edward, The Prince of Wales (the wedding taking place on 4 January, only eighteen days before Albert Edward became King-Emperor), who was a friend of Cassel. The couple had two daughters: Edwina, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, and Ruth Mary Clarisse (wife of Alec Cunningham-Reid, later Gardner, later Lady Delamere). After his first wife's early death he married, as his second wife, Muriel Emily ("Molly") Forbes-Sempill, the former wife of Rear-Admiral The Hon. A.L.O. Forbes-Sempill and daughter of The Rev. Walter Spencer. Lord Mount Temple died in July 1939, aged 71, when the barony became extinct.

Rade Kotur

Rade Kotur, born circa 1952 is a Bosnian Serb living in Sweden, where he has run a gambling empire and been involved in organized crime. Swedish newspapers have dubbed him "The Gambling King". In March 2009, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for instigating a murder, illegal gambling, and various forms of tax evasion.
Biography.
Kotur was born in Draksenić village near Bosanska Dubica, PR Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia, and was educated as a tradesman (car mechanic) in his home country. 
In 1972, Kotur, in his early twenties, moved to Sweden. One of his interests was karate, and he has earned a black belt in the sport.
In the 1980s Kotur bought a café located in the Gothenburg district of Bergsjön, which he made into a pizzeria. This pizzeria was later transformed into a gambling parlour that formed the basis for his gambling business called RK Company, with the name taken from Kotur's initials. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Kotur built up the RK Company, which operated automated poker and slot machines in pizzerias and convenience stores throughout Sweden.
Criminal activities.
Kotur's gambling empire also included unlicensed, illegal gambling machines. Already in 1978, Kotur had been convicted of tampering with a slot machine. In 1990, 1993, 2002 he was convicted on illegal gambling charges and for breaking the Lottery Act.
According to the prosecutor, Kotur's gambling business had a turnover of at least 463 million kronor ($74 million) between January 1, 2005 and November 13, 2007. Kotur was being charged with grievous tax crimes and false accounting in an alleged attempt to shield hundreds of millions of kronor generated from his gaming operations from the Swedish Tax Agency.
He was already on trial for his alleged involvement in the killing of Ratko Djokić. Ratko, known as The Godfather, operated a rival gambling operation at the time. Nenad Mišović spoke against Kotur in the media, but in August 2008 at the court process against Kotur he protected Kotur in his testimony. 
Kotur was arrested in the United Kingdom in November 2007, following a massive raid on his suspected illegal gambling operations, in which 400 slot machines were confiscated from 150 different locations throughout Sweden. Police succeeded to arrest him after a journalist from Swedish TV3 interviewed Nenad Mišović in prison and later journalists succeeded to find his phone number in London. He was then arrested by the police and extradicted to Sweden.

Monika Soćko (born Bobrowska, born 24 March 1978 in Warsaw) is a Polish chess player. She won the Polish women's chess championship four times (1995, 2004, 2008 and 2010). She is married to Polish GM Bartosz Soćko.
She achieved the title of Grandmaster in 2008. 
In 2007, Soćko won an international women's tournament in Baku, ahead of women's World Champion Antoaneta Stefanova. She won the 2009 Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, in spite of being only ranked as number 16 before the tournament, while her top-ranked husband finished in 13th place. In March 2010 she won the bronze medal at the European Chess Championship for Woman after defeating Yelena Dembo and Marie Sebag in the tie-breaks.
In 2011 she was part of the Polish women team at the European Team Chess Championship; they won the silver medal. 
Rules appeal in 2008.
In the 2008 Women's World Championship she was involved in a game which resulted in a dispute about the interpretation of the FIDE rules of chess. In an Armageddon game she needed a win to advance to the next round. The position got down to each player having only a king and a knight in which a checkmate position is possible but cannot be forced. Her opponent ran out of time under time control. Since checkmate cannot be forced with this material, the arbiter initially ruled that the game was a draw, therefore her opponent advanced to the next round. Soćko appealed, pointed out that the rules state that what matters is not whether or not checkmate can be "forced", but rather it is "possible". (see rules of chess#Timing.) The arbiter compared the possible checkmate position to a helpmate, in which the defender has to cooperate in order to get to the checkmate. Soćko won the appeal and advanced to the next round.

Extended reach drilling

Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) is directional drilling of very long horizontal wells. The aims of ERD are: a) to reach a larger area from one surface drilling location, and b) to keep a well in a reservoir for a longer distance in order to maximize its productivity and drainage capability.
Today’s challenges in ERD are hole cleaning, managing the mechanical loads on the drill string and managing downhole pressure. There is also the cost issue to consider.
Definition.
Early ERD-well definitions related wells to those that exceeded some step-out/vertical-depth ratio (often 2:1). However, for most highly deviated wells in deepwater environments, this definition clearly does not fit. Some methods have evolved to categorize wells according to their stepout within different vertical-depth ranges. ERD wells then can be described conveniently as shallow, intermediate, deep, and ultradeep. Other variants are associated with operating in deep water and high-pressure/high-temperature environments. Currently, there is no generally accepted ERD-well definition.
What exactly determines a well to be "extended reach" varies over time and location with the development of technologies and of experiences. 
New developments and innovations.
New technologies emerge that claims to be pushing the existing boundaries of ERD. One of these is the Reelwell Drilling Method, a drilling method solving problems for challenging wells, particularly suited for long reach wells. This innovation aims at multiplying the distance drilled by conventional ERD methods.

Harry Gosling

Harry Gosling CH (9 June 1861 – 24 October 1930) was a British Labour Party politician and trade union leader.
Early life.
Gosling was born in 1861 at 57 York Street, Lambeth, London, on the southern bank of the River Thames. He was the second son of William Gosling, master lighterman, and his wife Sarah Louisa née Rowe, a schoolteacher. His family were watermen, working on the river for several generations. Following an education at Blackfriars Elementary School, he entered employment as an office boy, aged 13. A year later he reached sufficient age to begin a seven-year apprenticeship to the Watermen's Company, working with his father on the wharves that would later become the site of the County Hall.
Trade unionism.
The success of the 1889 London Dock Strike encouraged the river workers to form a union, the Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen. Gosling was one of its first members, and was appointed general secretary in 1892, aged 32. In 1908 he was appointed as the workers' representative on the newly formed Port of London Authority, and to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. When the Watermen's Society was merged into the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1922, Gosling became the TGWU's first and only president, holding office until his death.
London County Council.
He was also a member of London County Council from 1898 to 1925, representing St George's-in-the-East until 1919 and Kennington thereafter. Initially he was a member of the Progressive Party on the council, forming a left wing group of "Labour Progressives" with John Burns and Will Crooks. In 1920 Labour formally became a separate party within the council, and Gosling became the first leader of the Labour group.
During the First World War Gosling was a member of the Port and Transit Executive, the body charged with organising imports and exports by sea. At the end of hostilities he was appointed to the Imperial War Graves Commission.
Parliament.
Gosling first stood for election to parliament as a Liberal Party candidate at the December 1910 general election but failed to win a seat at Lambeth North. At the next General Election in 1918 he stood as a Labour Party candidate at Uxbridge but was again defeated. The following General Election in 1922 he was again defeated as a Labour candidate at Kennington. In the following year C. J. Matthew, the sitting Labour MP for Whitechapel and St Georges died, and Gosling held the seat for the party at the ensuing by-election, retaining it until his death. For a short period in 1924 he was Minister of Transport and Paymaster General in the First Labour Government.
For the last six years of his life Gosling was in poor health. In 1927 he wrote a book of reminiscences "Up and Down Stream". He was the third person to be appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour. Harry Gosling died at his home in Twickenham in October 1930, aged 69. His body was laid in state at Transport House, headquarters of the TGWU, before its cremation at Golders Green.

The New Actors Workshop

The New Actors Workshop was a two-year acting conservatory in New York City founded by Master Teachers Mike Nichols, George Morrison and Paul Sills in 1988. The school offered a unique, dual-track curriculum combining Stanislavski-based technique with Viola Spolin Theater Games. The workshop stopped accepting students in 2010.
The founders.
Sills, Morrison, and Nichols enjoyed a long association dating back to the 50's at the University of Chicago. Their experience convinced them that there was a unique value for the actor in the double challenge of performance improvisation and Stanislavski-based training, and they founded The Workshop specifically to offer this powerful experience to a new generation of actors.
Performances.
There were different types of performances throughout the year in which students participated.
Friday Night Improv.
Students of the workshop played Spolin theatre games for an audience. These shows were free and open to the public.
Scene Nights.
At the end of their first year, students performed for family and friends in a New Actors Workshop Scene Night.
Story Theatre.
At the end of their second year, students went into a rehearsal period with a guest director. This production was most often a Story Theater show, a genre invented by Paul Sills in the 1960s. Guest directors included Paul Sills, Gene Hackman, Diane Paulus, Shira Piven, David Turner, Lester Thomas Shane, K Tanzer, Carol Sills

Lüderitz Speed Challenge

The Lüderitz Speed Challenge is an annual speed sailing event, held since 2007 in Lüderitz, Namibia, in the southern hemisphere spring. It is observed by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) and the International Sailing Federation (ISAF).
The site.
The event is held at the southern end of the 1x7 km lagoon west of Lüderitz, where between August and March every year there is a consistent, strong wind, blowing from the south at the perfect angle of 140 degrees to the sailing course. In the first, 2007 edition of the event, participants sailed over a curved course. For the second edition, in 2008, a straight course was created by digging along the shore, providing also a very uniform water depth over the entire run. Performance was further enhanced by placing sandbags upwind of the run, and by using temporary wood “chop killers” that reduce the chop caused by the Lüderitz to winds. The total course length is 800m, including the launching and slow-down phases, before and after the 500m official WSSRC distance.
Event history.
2007.
The first "Speed Challenge" event was held in 2007, in which French kitesurfer Alex Caizergues made the best 500m run at 47.92 knots – only short of the then-current world record, set in 2005 on The Canal by windsurfer Finian Maynard.
2008.
The second event saw the first ever over- outright speed sailing record, when on October 3 Sebastien Cattelan made 50.26 knots (93.08 km/h), only to lose the title one day later to Alex Caizergues at 50.57 knots (93.66 km/h). This achievement marked the end of the race of the speed sailing world to cross the mark, between kitesurfers, windsurfers and sailboats, and opened the race towards the next "mythical frontier" of 100 km/h.
The women's outright speed sailing record was also broken during this event, by South African kitesurfer Sjoukje Bredenkamp, who improved her own previous world record to 45.20 knots (83.71 km/h).
Earlier in the event, on September 19, kitesurfer Rob Douglas (USA) made a 49.84 knots (92.30 km/h) run, becoming the first kitesurfer to establish an outright speed sailing world record – held until that date only by sailboats or windsurfers. However, the international sailing community changed its definition of sailing so that kitesurfing is no longer sailing. Douglas also became the world's third over- sailor,
when on September 8 he made a 50.54 knots (93.60 km/h) run.

Company history.
The company was founded in 1983 by Heinz Reschke. It initially developed individual software solutions for various industries. Visual comparison of signatures supported by PCs was started in 1987, triggered by growing demand from major financial institutions. Shortly afterwards the development of automatic signature verification started along with IBM's labs in nearby Schönaich and APP Informatik Davos from Switzerland. The automatic verification is based on a neural network and fuzzy logic. The first automatic verification went into production in 1994 at Credit Suisse. Intellectual property rights for the automatic signature verification were acquired from IBM in 1998.
In recent years SOFTPRO extended its product range through a check fraud prevention suite branded FraudOne and products to create electronic signatures based on the use and verification of dynamic (biometric) characteristics of signatures.

Peter Madáč obtained a basic education from the local Catholic school, and later studied in Horná Slaná and Patakiho Olácha. In 1743 he arrived in Štítnik and studied grammar, Latin, and the Catechetism under Tubelu. He studied at the school in Kežmarok, in Levoča, and in Debrecín, and from 1757 onwards studied medicine in Wittenberg, Leipzig, and Berlin.

Battle of Ghazdewan

The Battle of Ghazdewan occurred in what is now Uzbekistan in 1512 AD between Babur's Mughal army and invading Uzbek tribes from Central Asia. It resulted in Babur's defeat after which he resigned hope of recovering his father's empire of Ferghana. It also helped solidify the alliance between the Murgai empire and the Ottoman empire.
Prelude.
After Babur's defeat at the Battle of Kul Malek, he applied for assistance from Biram Khan Karamanlu, the commander serving the Safavid Persian Shah Ismail I at Balkh. With additional support from Biram's detachment, the Uzbeks eventually withdrew from the country of Hissar. After this victory, and in response to his defeat at Kul Malek, Babur personally visited Shah Ismail I to solicit an additional force which he could use to finally defeat the Uzbeks from Mawarannahr (Transoxiana). The Shah accordingly called on Amir Najm Sani, his minister of finance, whom he had entrusted with the settlement of Khurasan. Ismail gave him instructions to render assistance to Babur in recovering the dominions he had previously possessed.
On reaching Balkh, Amir Najm resolved to march in person into Mawarannahr, taking with him the governor of Herat, the Amirs of Greater Khorasan|Khurasan, and Biram Khan of Balkh. During his journey, Amir Najm passed the Amu Darya and was soon joined by Babur, creating an army that is said to have been 60,000 men strong.
Battle.
Early in the Autumn the army advanced to Khozar, ultimately seizing the city. They then proceeded to Karshi, which had been strongly fortified and garrisoned by Sultan Ubaydullah Sultan, the chief of Bukhara.
It was proposed to leave Karshi behind as had been done with success in preceding campaigns, but Amir Najm, believing it was Sultan Ubaydullah Sultan's lair, declared that it must be taken. The city was therefore besieged and carried by storm with all inhabitants, Uzbek or not, being put to the sword regardless of age, sex, or sanctity. The circumstances of this massacre disgusted Babur, who found himself playing a subordinate role in an army that was professedly acting under his authority. In his desire to save the inhabitants, who were Chaghatai Turks of his own race and sect, he earnestly besought Amir Najm Sani to comply with his wishes. But the unrelenting Persian, deaf to his entreaties, let loose all the fury of war on the devoted city. Among the casualties was the poet Maulana Binai, one of the most eminent minds of his time who happened to be in the town when it fell in the indiscriminate slaughter, along with many Syeds and holy men. From that time forward, Amir Najm failed to prosper in any more of his undertakings.
The Uzbek chiefs, after the massacre at Karshi, appeared for some time to have retired and fortified themselves in their strongholds. Amir Najm eventually moved on to attack Ghazdewan, on the border of the desert, without having taken Bukhara. The Uzbek sultans now had time to assemble under the command of Ubaydullah Sultan. Joined by Timur Sultan from Samarkand, they threw themselves into the fort the very night that Babur and Amir Najm had taken their ground before it, preparing their engines and ladders for an assault.
In the morning, the Uzbeks drew out their army and took up a position among the houses and gardens in the suburbs of the town with the confederates advancing to meet them. The Uzbeks, who were protected by the broken ground and by the walls of the enclosures and houses, had posted archers in every corner to pour a shower of arrows on the Qizilbashes as they approached. Once Biram Khan, the chief military command of the Qizilbash troops, had fallen off his horse and had been wounded, the main body of the army fell into disorder. In the course of an hour the invaders were routed with most of them falling in the field. Babur routed and discomfited fled back to Hissar. It is said that the Qizilbash chiefs, disgusted with the haughtiness and insolence of Amir Najm, did not use their utmost efforts to assist him and he was eventually taken prisoner and put to death. Many of the Persian chiefs who fled from the battle crossed the Amu Darya at Kirki and entered Greater Khorasan.
Aftermath.
The Uzbeks now not only recovered the country which they had lost in Transoxiana, but also made incursions into Greater Khorasan|Khurasan, ravaging the northern part of the province. Shah Ismail I, on hearing of this disaster, resolved to return. On his approach the Uzbeks retreated in alarm. He caused several of the officers who had escaped from the battle to be seized and some of them to be executed for deserting their commander. Certain inhabitants of the province, accused of having shown attachment to the Uzbeks and their creed and of having vexed the Shias, were consumed in the fire of his wrath. The fatal battle of Ghazdewan, the destruction of Babur's Persian allies, and the numbers and power of the Uzbeks seemed to leave him no hopes of again ascending the throne of Samarkand and Bukhara. Babur had now resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana, and although he dreaded an invasion from the Uzbeks to his West, his attention increasingly turned towards India and its lands in the East.

List of Interstate Highways in Connecticut

Interstate Highways in the U.S. state of Connecticut run a total of . Connecticut has three primary highways and five auxiliary highways. Most of the highways are maintained by the Connecticut Department of Transportation, with the exception of Interstate 684, which is maintained by the New York State DOT.
In 1957, Connecticut received approval for the routes of its three primary Interstate highways: I-84, I-91, and I-95. This plan was extended in 1959 to include I-291 and I-491. The first Interstate Highway signs were installed on a completed section of I-91 north of Hartford in 1961. The primary interstates were all completed by 1969 after the last section of I-84 opened between Farmington and Plainville. The rest of the highways were built or renumbered to their current designations by 1994 when a five mile section of I-291 opened 35 years behind schedule. Connecticut was one of the last states in the US to raise its maximum speed limit to , which it did in 1998. 
Though parts of the Interstate Highway System in Connecticut were once tolled, no toll booths exist today. All tolls on I-95 were removed in 1985 after a runaway truck ran into a line of cars waiting at a booth, killing seven.

History.
In 1926, the U.S. highway system was implemented. U.S. Routes 1, 5, 6, and 7, plus 202 were used as designations on several primary state highways, replacing New England routes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The other New England routes that were not re-designated as U.S. routes became ordinary state highways but kept their number designation, which are used even today (with some realignment).

Altwood

Altwood is a historic plantation house located near Faunsdale, Alabama. It was built in 1836 by Richard H. Adams and began as a log dogtrot house. It was then expanded until it came to superficially resemble a Tidewater-type cottage. Brought to the early Alabama frontier by settlers from the Tidewater and Piedmont regions of Virginia, this vernacular house-type is usually a story-and-a-half in height, displays strict symmetry, and is characterized by prominent end chimneys flanking a steeply pitched longitudinal gable roof that is often pierced by dormer windows. 
The house was moved to Cedar Crest Farms in 1988 and restored by members of the Rankin family. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on February 19, 1988 and to the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1993 as a part of the Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings Multiple Property Submission.

Margit Bjørløw Brandt (27 January 1945 – 24 October 2011) was a Danish fashion designer.
Biography.
Margit Brandt graduated from Margretheskolen (1961–1964), Københavns Tilskærerakademi (1964), and completed an apprenticeship in tailoring. She started her international career in 1965 as an apprentice in Paris with the grand master of the time French fashion designer Pierre Balmain. Her inventiveness and confident style won her recognition and in 1966 she continued her career in the couture house of Louis Feraud on Rue du Fauborg Saint Honore. In 1966 she married Erik Brandt, who was working with the French company Mendes (owned by the nephew of the former French president Pierre Mendes France), which produced prêt-a-porter for Lanvin, Guy La Roche, Yves Saint Laurent and many others.
The marriage would be the catalyst for one of the most successful Scandinavian designer couples. The Brandts returned to Denmark shortly after they got married and in 1966 Margit introduced her own collection at the Copenhagen Fashion Fair under the B-age label. In the eyes of her contemporaries this was a line of unprecedentedly short and close-fitting designs, but the collection immediately grabbed the interest of an otherwise neglected age group between teenagers and "genteel" ladies. B-age became the essence of fashion for the first generation of young women in Scandinavia.
Soon Margit and Erik were producing everything from ladies fashion to lingerie, furs, sportswear, watches, personal care products, household articles and accessories. The trendsetting designs found their way to the showrooms of Harrods, Bendels, Takashimaya, Saks and Bloomingdales, a wide network of own label stores sprung up across the world from London, Paris and Barcelona to Tokyo, San Francisco and New York. Erik had a nose for branding and self-promotion, one year the staff at the fashion fair were replaced by a red telephone with a direct line to head office. Buyers could simply call in their orders if they wanted to buy anything.
As jetsetters the couple developed an eccentric group of friends based in and around the famous New York club Studio 54 where they developed close friendships with the likes of Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Diana Vreeland and Truman Capote. 
In the early 1980s Margit and Erik Brandt announced they moved to New York permanently.
In 2005 again based in Denmark they have commenced designing and producing fashion clothes again.
In the book "Fashion Genius of the World" (1979) written by Serena Sinclair, Margit Brandt comes second after the British cult designer Mary Quant.
Margit Brandt died at home with her family due to her chronic obstructive lung disease.

Monti della Tolfa

The Monti della Tolfa or "Tolfa Mountains" are a volcanic group in the Anti-Apennines of the northern part of the Lazio region of central Italy. They are bounded by the Tyrrhenian Sea coast to the west, by the Monti Sabatini to the east, and by the Monti Cimini and the Mignone river to the north. Tolfa and Allumiere are the principal towns.
The highest peak is the Monte della Grazie, at 616 m above sea level. The Monti della Tolfa consist mostly of trachytes formed during the Eocene and the early Pleistocene. 
The mountains are an important source of alunite, from which alum is extracted. The mineral was discovered there in 1461, and extensively mined until the mine closed in 1941, after almost 500 years; for much of this time it was the principal source of alum in Europe. 
The Tolfetano breed of horse originates in the area, and takes its name from it.

Conical combination

Given a finite number of vectors formula_1 in a real vector space, a conical combination, conical sum, or weighted sum of these vectors is a vector of the form
where the real numbers formula_3 satisfy formula_4 
The name derives from the fact that a conical sum of vectors defines a cone (possibly in a lower dimensional subspace).
Conical hull.
The set of all conical combinations for a given set "S" is called the conical hull of "S" and denoted "cone" ("S"), or "coni" ("S"), that is, 
By definition, the zero point (origin) belongs to all conical hulls.
The conical hull of a set "S" is a convex set. In fact, it is the intersection of all convex cones containing "S" plus the origin. If "S" is a compact set (in particular, when it is a finite set of points), then the condition "plus the origin" is unnecessary. 
If we discard the origin, we can divide all coefficients by their sum to see that a conical combination is a convex combination scaled by a positive factor. 
Therefore, the "conical combination" and "conical hull" are more accurately to be called the "convex conical combination" and "convex conical hull" respectively. Moreover, the above remark about dividing the coefficients while discarding the origin implies that the conical combinations and hulls may be considered as convex combinations and convex hulls in the projective space.
While the convex hull of a compact set is a compact set as well, this is not so for the conical hull: first of all, the latter one is unbounded. Moreover, it is even not necessarily a closed set: a counterexample is a sphere passing through the origin, with the conical hull being an open half-space plus the origin. However if "S" is a nonempty compact set which does not contain the origin, then the conical hull of "S" is a closed set.

Trade finance

Trade Finance is basically related to 'Domestic as well as International Trade Transaction'.
The term "Trade Finance" means, finance for Trade. For a trade transaction there should be a Seller to sell the goods or services and a Buyer who will buy the goods or use the services. Various intermediaries such as (banks), (Financial Institutions) can facilitate this trade transaction by financing the trade.
While a seller (the exporter) can require the purchaser (an importer) to prepay for goods shipped, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped. Banks may assist by providing various forms of support. For example, the importer's bank may provide a letter of credit to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a bill of lading. The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.
Other forms of trade finance can include Documentary Collection, Trade Credit Insurance, Factoring or Forfaiting. Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
Since secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer, the advent of new methodologies in the information systems world, has allowed the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into new advanced finance models. This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the Importer's Balance Sheet. As the world progresses towards more flexibility and growth in Trade Transactions, the demand for these new methodologies has increased amongst Exporters, Importers and Banks.
The following are the most famous products/services offered by various Banks and Financial Institutions in Trade Finance Segment.
1. Letter of Credit: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institute on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institute as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institute will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
2. Bank Guarantee: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary. Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.
3. Collection and Discounting of Bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks. The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.

Duo Gelland

Duo Gelland is a Swedish-German violin duo on the international classical scene. It was founded in 1994.
Biography.
Duo Gelland was founded in 1994. Their early recordings of Cantus gemellus by Dieter Acker and the fiercely demanding one hour long cycle for two violins (1951) by Allan Pettersson showed the true potentials of the violin duo, inspiring many composers to turn to this medium. Duo Gelland received over 100 dedications, among them duos by: Giorgio Netti, Bernd Franke, Alexander Keuk, Madeleine Isaksson, Birgitte Alsted, Kerstin Jeppsson, Ingvar Karkoff, Maurice Karkoff, Olov Franzén, Gunnar Bucht, Carin Bartosch Edström, Rolf Martinsson, Erika Förare, Miklós Maros, Gerhard Samuel, Johan Ramström, Paula af Malmborg Ward, Marie Samuelsson, Peter Schuback, Victoria Bond, Anders Hultqvist, Max Käck, Ole Lützow-Holm, Nikolaus Brass, Michael Fiday, Justin Rubin. 
Duo Gelland also premiered duos by other composers - never performed due to lack of permanent violin duos - by Werner Wolf Glaser, Erika Förare, Oleg Gotskosik, Ture Rangström. Further important duos belonging to their repertory are those by Luigi Nono, James Dillon, Olga Neuwirth, Giacinto Scelsi, Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, Jacqueline Fontyn. 
Duo Gelland's performance of Traumwerk by James Dillon was filmed by Johan Ramström. It was awarded the Jahrespreis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik 2008. Another award is the Interpreter’s Prize of the Society of Swedish Composers (FST). The inscription reads: 
"They take on the new music with an overwhelming empathy and a virtually feverish intensity, catching the audience in a bubble of absolute presence".
Duo Gelland received dedications of works for violin duo and orchestra or ensemble by Harold Blumenfeld (premiered 1996), Ingvar Karkoff (premiere 2009), Olov Franzén (premiere 2010), Olof Lindgren (premiered 2002). Håkan Larsson (premiered 2002). January 2003 Duo Gelland premiered Håkan Larsson's Angesicht in Angesicht - inspired by Ingmar Bergman's films - for violin duo and orchestra in the Berliner Philharmonie. Spring 2003 two works for violin duo and choir by Hans-Erik Dahlgren and Olof Lindgren were premiered together with Dresdner Kammerchor and Hans-Christoph Rademann.
In Berliner Philharmonie 2006 together with the RIAS Kammerchor and Hans-Christoph Rademann, Duo Gelland premiered works for violin duo and choir by Sunleif Rasmussen, Peter Schuback and Håkan Larsson. 
The dramatic and physical qualities of Duo Gelland's stage presence has been cultivated in cross over productions e.g. in provocatively moving The donkey on Mars, text Kasëm Trebeshina (Albania), in collaboration with choreographer Britta Hanssen and composer Birgitte Alsted. Here the synthesis of emotion, motion, word and sound is explored in a mode which could be referred to as violin theater.
Duo Gelland's growing historic repertory involves research in archives and libraries. The musicologist Ulrich Mazurowicz points out that the second half of the 18th century into the beginning of the 19th century was a period when string duos were printed more often than any other constellation including songs, operas, string quartets, music for orchestra or piano. Of all these string duos the major part was violin duos. 
Duo Gelland's continuous study of historic literature on music performance, theory and philosophy is a source of inspiration facing both their old and their new repertoire.
Characteristic for Duo Gelland's work with new music is the close collaboration with composers and the search for an individual world of sounds for each new composition approached.
Also important are the frequent informal presentations of new duos to children in the class room. This mostly takes place in the municipality of Strömsund, Jämtland, northern Sweden, where Duo Gelland is artist in residence since 2002.
Duo Gelland considers the work with children artistically fruitful.
The teachers of the violinists were Max Rostal, Walter Levin and each one of the other members of the LaSalle Quartet, Ricardo Odnoposoff, Gerhart Hetzel, Kurt Sassmannshaus, Ingeborg Scheerer, Josef Grünfarb, Machie Oguri-Kudo and for shorter periods Valery Klimov, Wolfgang Schneiderhan, Pierre d'Archambeau, composition and theory Allen Sapp.

<doc id="19634672" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19634672" title="Sparta Rock House">
Sparta Rock House

The Sparta Rock House is a stone building near Sparta, Tennessee, United States, that once served as a rest stop and tollhouse. Built in the late 1830s, the Rock House catered to traffic along an important wagon road between Knoxville and Nashville, offering badly needed lodging and supplies to travellers who had just crossed (or were about to cross, depending on their direction) the rugged Cumberland Plateau. The Rock House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for its architecture and its historical role as an important rest stop.
The Rock House was probably built by either Samuel Denton or brothers Barlow and Madison Fiske, and initially operated by the latter two. Early guests at the Rock House included presidents Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, and Governor Sam Houston. It was home to a tollhouse and supply store until at least the 1850s, and was used as a school at various times between 1880 and 1921. Due primarily to the efforts of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the state purchased and began restoring the Rock House in the 1940s. The Rock House is currently operated as a state historic site.
Location.
The Sparta Rock House is located at the junction of U.S. Route 70 and White County Highway 2220 (Country Club Road). The Rock House property sits on a shelf-like slope that lies along the physiographic boundary between the Cumberland Plateau to the east and the Highland Rim to west. The elevation of US-70 is approximately at Sparta (on the Highland Rim), as it passes the Rock House, and just over as it tops out at the edge of the Cumberland Plateau. The Rock House State Historic Site property includes a large plot of woodland that extends east from the Rock House to Old Bon Air Road. 
History.
The Walton Road, an early wagon road connecting Knoxville and Nashville, forked at Crossville atop the Cumberland Plateau. The main branch (roughly following the modern US-70N) continued northwestward to what is now Monterey, while a second branch (roughly following the modern US-70) proceeded westward to what is now Sparta. To provide a rest stop for travellers along the latter branch, the Rock House was built on the property of local farmer Samuel Denton sometime between 1835 and 1839. While sources are unclear as to whether Denton or the Fiske brothers, Barlow and Madison, built the Rock House, the Fiske brothers were nevertheless in possession of the structure by 1839. There is no definitive evidence that Barlow and Madison Fiske were brothers. Along with providing a nightly stopover, the Rock House was used as a tollhouse until the late 1850s, as wagon roads during this period were often contracted out to local operators. The construction of the Bon Air Hotel atop the Plateau a few miles to the east in the 1840s no doubt brought increased traffic to the Rock House, although the hotel was destroyed during the U.S. Civil War. 
In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the Rock House was used variously as a residence and a school, known simply as the "Rock House School." In 1941, the Daughters of the American Revolution obtained appropriations from the Tennessee state government to purchase and restore the Rock House, which it operated as a public museum and meeting place for its local chapter. A local craftsman named Clifton Broyle completed numerous renovations at the Rock House in the 1960s. 
Design.
The Rock House was originally a rectangular structure built of native sandstone quarried in the vicinity. A partition once divided the structure into two rooms, but that partition has been removed, and the original section of the structure now consists of one large room. A 1909 photograph shows a partially enclosed front porch spanning the front wall, but by the 1940s the porch had been torn down. In the mid-20th century, a new rear section was added to the structure, built of the same type of stone, but containing modern conveniences. The interior of the Rock House has large fireplaces at both ends of the original structure, and the wooden doors, window frames, ceiling, floor, and mantels are all original.

Mexico–Turkey relations

Mexican–Turkish relations refers to the diplomatic relations between Mexico and Turkey.
History.
Diplomatic relations between the two nations were established in 1928 after the transformation of Turkey from the Ottoman Empire by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern Turkish republic in 1923; and after the end of the Mexican revolution in 1920. Since then, both nations have opened embassies in each other's capitals respectively.
Present day.
Today relations between Mexico and Turkey are based on friendship and on similarities. Both nations are developing countries with major economies which both sit on enormous cultural cross-roads between developed and developing countries; Turkey bordering both Asia and Europe (including the European Union) and Mexico bordering the United States and Latin America. In 2009, Recep Tayyip Erdogan became the second Turkish Prime Minister to visit Mexico. In December 2013, President Enrique Peña Nieto became the first Mexican president to pay an official state visit to Turkey.
Trade.
Today, Mexico is the fourteenth biggest economy and Turkey is seventeenth biggest economy in the world. Although both nations are huge economic world players, trade between the two nations, unfortunately, is minuscule with two-way trade between the two nations amounting to approximately eight hundred million dollars (USD) in 2011. Currently both nations are seeking to establish a free trade agreement before the end of 2013.
Common memberships.
Both nations are members of the G-20, OECD and the United Nations.

Ben Cormack (born 13 October 1982) is a British writer and illustrator. His books have sold more than 200,000 copies worldwide and have been translated into over ten languages.
Works.
The Story of Egmo.
The Story of Egmo is the first novel written and illustrated by Ben Cormack. In early 2007 the London Library Development Agency promoted the book, which was made available for free download, as part of its first literacy campaign targeted at children and young adults. The book received over 25,000 downloads within the first year and achieved national recognition from The Independent, N.U.T. magazine and Viz comic.
The book's protagonist, 'Egmo' is an ill-fated anti hero whose many eccentricities put him firmly out of step with the world. When he unearths the global domination plans of local would-be-criminal-mastermind Krapodkin he sets out on a fantastical mission to restore relative normality.
'Francis and Bunty', a short story set in the 'Story of Egmo' universe, was used to front the 2009 'Best Writer in the Universe' short story competition. It was narrated for the Story of Egmo podcast by popular comedian and BBC presenter Adam Buxton.
Cartoon Clinic.
Cartoon clinic is an instruction drawing manual aimed at younger artists. Cartoon Clinic places more emphasis on narrative drive by using several fictional cartoon characters which lead the reader through the book whilst dispensing advice in an informal manner.
"The funny thing about books on cartooning is that they're usually not very funny. Cormack's is not only witty, but it's surprisingly well written and comprehensive. The first four chapters explore tools and equipment, drawing basic elements, inking and coloring techniques, and composition and layout. Each chapter contains tutorials that deal with different areas to practice. The tutorials are interspersed with "clinics" where common cartooning problems are highlighted and solutions suggested. The final chapter consists of a very useful gallery of work in a variety of styles from a wide range of professionals. Cormack's chapters on cartoons and computers, hand gestures, and cartoon heads and facing are especially good. You have to love an art instruction book that covers "Hygiene Tips" and "Making Good Your Screw-Ups." Highly recommended." - Library Journal
Anatomy for Fantasy Artists.
"Anatomy for Fantasy Artists" is a technical reference book aimed at teaching the artist principles of anatomy, from musculature and skeletal structure through to movement. The book is a collaborative effort between Ben Cormack and noted 'Preacher' cover artist Glen Fabry. Since its release in 2005 it has sold over 125,000 copies with distribution across five continents (in several language versions).
Other work.
Animated short 'The Child' won the 'Best Piece' Rafta animation award in 2003.

Out of position (crash testing)

Out of position (OOP), in crash testing and car accident medical literature, indicates a passenger position which is not the normal, upright and forward position. For example, a common case observed in crashes is the position of an occupant when reaching for the car radio, or panic braking in unbelted passengers. The concept is of interest because little changes in passenger's position, especially in rear impacts, can have profound effects on the actual kinematic response, as shown both by practical testing and theoretical models.
Risk of injury.
Out of position occupants are at increased risk of injury. Even low speed impacts can cause disc herniation and lumbar fracture on OOP passengers. Airbags can prove fatal on OOP passengers: 
modulating the airbag folding pattern has been proposed as a method to reduce injuries. Crash testing has shown increased forces acting on the neck and torso when dummies were leaning forward and not upright; a partial correlation with the seat stiffness has been observed, with stiffer seats increasing the force loads on the upper neck.

John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford

John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford (14 August 1499 – 14 July 1526) was an English peer and landowner.
By inheritance he was Lord Great Chamberlain of England, and in June 1520, at the age of twenty, he attended King Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. The young earl was considered a wastrel: in 1523 the king orderered him to moderate his hunting, to eat and drink less, to give up late nights, and to be less extravagant in his dress. He died at the age of twenty-six.
Family.
John de Vere, born 14 August 1499, was the second but only surviving son of Sir George Vere and his second wife, Margaret, the daughter of Sir William Stafford of Bishop's Frome in Herefordshire by Elizabeth Wrottesley, daughter of Hugh Wrottesley, esquire. Sir George Vere had been intended for the priesthood, and in 1459, when he was only sixteen, his father, John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, appointed him to a benefice in Lavenham, Suffolk. However both the 12th Earl and his eldest son and heir, Aubrey de Vere, were executed in February 1462, and George then became second in line to the earldom as the potential heir to his brother, John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford. Instead of George, his younger brother, Richard, became a priest, and in 1459 George married, as his first wife, Margaret Talbot (d. December 1472), the sister and coheir of Thomas Talbot, 2nd Viscount Lisle (d. March 1470). He fought at the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471, and was with his elder brother, John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, when he seized St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall on 30 September 1473. Sir George Vere was attainted in Parliament in early 1475, together with his brothers, John and Thomas. Ross states that Sir George Vere was never officially pardoned, although Richardson states that his attainder was reversed when King Henry VII came to the throne in 1485.
By his father's second marriage to Margaret Stafford, John de Vere had four sisters:
Career.
Sir George Vere died in 1503, leaving a will dated 21 August 1500 which was proved on 3 April 1503. At his father's death John de Vere, who was then a child of four, became a royal ward.
In 1513, de Vere inherited the estates and honours of his uncle, John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, who had died at Castle Hedingham on 10 March 1513. On 22 April, he was the chief mourner at his uncle's impressive funeral, at which nine hundred black gowns were given out to the mourners in attendance. The 13th Earl of Oxford was buried at Colne Priory, and at the burial ceremony 'A mounted knight, armed with an axe, was led into the choir by two knights and delivered the axe to the bishop, who gave it to the heir'.
When John de Vere was only twelve years of age, the 13th Earl had married his nephew and heir presumptive to Anne Howard, a daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, by his second wife, Agnes Tilney, a marriage which served the purpose of uniting the families of the two greatest magnates in East Anglia. The marriage settlement was dated 16 November 1511 and the ceremony took place before 1 May 1512. Although the marriage settlement itself does not survive, evidence of its provisions is found in the 13th Earl's will.
On 29 May 1514, Henry VIII, in the exercise of his royal prerogative, treated de Vere's marriage as technically invalid on the grounds that de Vere had been under the age of fourteen at the date of the marriage. As was his prerogative right as king, he offered to de Vere, who by then had succeeded as the 14th Earl and become a royal ward, Margaret Courtenay as a bride. De Vere refused Margaret. The King then granted both de Vere's future marriage and the fine imposed on him for his rejection of Margaret Courtenay to de Vere's father-in-law, Norfolk. At the same time, the King granted to Norfolk, during the 14th Earl's minority, custody of the Earl's lands, as well as the reversion of lands held in dower by the 13th Earl's widow, the Dowager Countess Elizabeth, and the offices of Lord Great Chamberlain of England, Steward of the Forest of Essex, and Constable of Colchester Castle.
The 14th Earl attended Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in June 1520, where he was one of the judges of the foot races. In 1520, he came of age and was granted livery of his lands on 16 August of that year. In 1522, he was in attendance when King Henry met the Emperor Charles V between Dover and Canterbury.
His modern biographer, James Ross, considers the 14th Earl "an incompetent wastrel". In 1523, when he was twenty-four years of age, the King commanded him, through Cardinal Wolsey, to discharge his household and live with his father-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, and demean himself lovingly towards his wife. He was restricted to a household of only twenty men and women, was not allowed to grant any offices or annuities, and was ordered to "moderate his excessive hunting, drink less wine, not stay up late, eat less meat, and forbear excessive and superfluous apparel".
Nonetheless, the Earl was at court in 1525 and 1526, officiating in June 1525 when the King's illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy, was created Earl of Nottingham and witnessing the charter for the creation of Wolsey's college, Cardinal College, on 5 May 1526.
The 14th Earl died on 14 July 1526, aged twenty-six, and was buried at Colne Priory. No trace of his tomb remains. At his death, his office of Lord Great Chamberlain reverted to the crown, as did the Barony of Plaiz.
The 14th Earl left no issue and was succeeded by his second cousin, John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford. Both were great-grandsons of Richard de Vere, 11th Earl of Oxford.
After the 14th Earl's death, his widow complained to both Cardinal Wolsey and to her brother, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, about the 15th Earl's conduct towards her. On 11 August 1526, she wrote to Wolsey alleging that the 15th Earl, Sir John Raynsford and their men had on two occasions broken into the park at Lavenham and killed more than one hundred deer. On 22 August, she wrote to her brother complaining that the new Earl continued to retain possession of Castle Camps. The Dowager Countess was back in possession during the years 1530-34, when she sent several letters to Thomas Cromwell from Castle Camps, in one of which she complained of a certain Alexander Irlam, parson of Belchamp Otten, "who in my lord my husband's time convented with other to have poisoned me".
The Earl's widow survived him for many years, dying before 22 February 1558/59, when she was buried in the Howard chapel in the Church of St Mary-at-Lambeth.
The 14th Earl of Oxford is said to have been referred to as "Little John of Campes" because of his diminutive stature. According to Cokayne, however, "it is much more likely that he was so called because he was a child, and that the other story was invented to account for the nickname".

Broadway Auto Row, Oakland, California

Oakland's Broadway Auto Row is a strip of land along Broadway between Grand Avenue at the Southwest, and 40th Street to the Northeast. The strip has a history of land use for car dealerships, light industrial businesses, and other automotive service businesses that serve motorists. The businesses and sales in the area are a part of Oakland's economic base. In recent years, the area is seen as ripe for mixed-use development intensification, and other bicycle and pedestrian improvements
Tax Base.
With annual tax revenues of more than $3 million for years, the dozen or so dealerships on Broadway have historically been one of the city's largest sources of sales tax revenue. During his term in office, former Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown appeared in a series of televised "Buy Oakland" commercials. Notwithstanding Browns public advocacy for Oakland-based businesses, sales taxes on new automobiles sold in California are remitted to the buyer's municipality of residence, no matter where in the state the vehicle was purchased.
Development Intensification.
In recent years, real-estate developers, city planning officials, politicians, and others have discussed and made plans to relocate the historic Auto Row to a site at the old Oakland Army Base at the foot of the San Francisco Bay Bridge in West Oakland. Plans are to build a Bay Bridge Auto Mall on at the site.
Transportation Infrastructure.
Originally developed as Oakland's first street leading from the Jack London Square waterfront, Broadway remains one of Oakland's busiest streets, carrying copious quantities of peak period private automobile trips, in addition to bus, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
AC Transit's 51A line runs through the area down Broadway to connect the people of the Rockridge district, and other neighborhoods of North Oakland, with Oakland's Downtown. The 51A line is one of the system's busiest, carrying a large volume of passengers through the corridor.
A lighted, flashing pedestrian crosswalk is located on a long block of Broadway near 30th street, in-between intersections, to give greater visibility to pedestrian traffic in the area.
A Class 2 bicycle lane runs along the right-hand edge of Broadway, but only between 27th Street and MacArthur Blvd. As of the summer of 2008, an Oakland bicycle and pedestrian advocacy organization: Walk Oakland Bike Oakland (WOBO) has advocated for expansion of the bike lane to a greater portion of Broadway.

Heo Nanseolheon

Heo Nanseolheon (1563–1589), born Heo Chohui, was a prominent Korean female poet of the mid Joseon dynasty. She was the younger sister of Heo Pong, a minister and political writer, and elder to Heo Gyun (1569–1618), a prominent writer of the time and credited as the author of The Tale of Hong Gildong. Her own writings consisted of some two hundred poems written in Chinese verse (hanshi), and two poems written in hangul (though her authorship of the hangul poems is contested).
Biography.
Heo Nanseolheon was born in Gangneung to a prominent political family (yangban). Her father, Heo Yeop, was a distinguished scholar and fathered her by his second marriage. His first was to a daughter of Prince Seop'yeong, who yielded two daughters and a son. His second marriage was to a daughter of a political minister, who mothered Nanseolheon and her two brothers. While her father was a Confucian and conservative official who subscribed tightly to the belief of ""namjon yubi"" - literally, "Men Above, Women Below." It fell to her elder brother, Heo Pong, to recognize her budding talent and curiosity and introduce her to literature. From an early age she became recognized as a prodigal poet, though due to her position as a woman she was incapable of entering into a position of distinguishment. Her early piece, "Inscriptions on the Ridge Pole of the White Jade Pavilion in the Kwanghan Palace" ("Kwanghanjeon Paegongnu sangnangmun"), produced at the age of eight, was lauded as a work of poetic genius and earned her the epithet "immortal maiden." Her innate talent for "hanmun" (Chinese) verse prompted him to be her first tutor in her early years, and introduce her to Chinese writing, such as the Confucian Five Classics. However, Heo Pong was also an outspoken and influential political scholar, and was eventually exiled to Kapsan for three years for his political leanings. Her younger brother, Heo Gyun, was a similarly gifted poet who studied under the Tang poet Yi Tal, a friend of Heo Pong, and he took part in her education, especially after her elder brother's exile. He fostered her education later in life, and used his preferred position as a highly respected male to keep her in correspondence with literary circles. Yi Tal, his tutor, also engaged in sharing Tang poetry with Nanseolheon, whose influence became visible in the naturalism of a significant portion of her surviving work.
Sometime during her life, she married to the son of a civil official, Kim Seongnip. Her marriage was an unhappy one, as recorded by Heo Gyun. Her husband often left her alone at home to pursue the exploits of other women, and she maintained a cold relationship with her mother-in-law. She gave birth to two children, a girl and a boy, but both died in infancy in subsequent years. Within a year of her elder brother Heo Pong's death in Kapsan, she herself died at the age of twenty seven.
The circumstances and timing of her marriage are uncertain, and documented proof is limited and subject to conjecture. Scholars such as Kim-Renaud and Choe-Wall engage with her literature, and hypothesize that she lived among her brothers for a significant portion of her life (during which they suggest most of her Tang-influenced and naturalistic poetry was produced), and married later. She suggests that the body of her "empathetic" poetry was produced after her entrance to matrimony, as a result of her suffering from the deprivation of those who supported her literary talents and the access to poetic circles that they offered her. This conjecture is formed from the observation that a significant portion of what is believed to be her later literature laments the plight and sufferings of married women, and her early literature follows closely in the Tang tradition, employing heavy elements of folklore and natural imagery rather than the heavier emotive language found in her later writing.
Writings.
A significant amount of Nanseolheon's writing was burned upon her death per her request, and the surviving poems are collected in Heo Kyeongnan's 1913 collection "Nansŏrhŏn chip." The collection consists of 211 poems, in various Chinese styles. These include "koshi" (traditional verse), "yulshi" (metered verse), "cheolgu" (quatrains), and a single example of "kobu" (rhyming prose). The writing of the early Joseon period (in the form of the political Sajang school and the more academic Sallim school) was heavily influenced by the Confucian literary tradition, and literature was primarily devoted to the expression of Confucian teachings. With the introduction of Tang poetry to Korea in the Mid-Joseon Period, "hanmun" poetry began making significant strides as an art form. Traditional Tang poetry ("koshi") was more formulaic and imposed prescriptive tonal guidelines. During the lifetime of Nanseolheon, new forms of poetry that incorporated tonal irregularities, lines with non-standard syllable counts, and length (broadly referred to as "kunch'e shi", of which "yulshi" and "cheolgu" are subsets) began to come into favor. Nanseolheon's works are noted primarily for their broad range of subject matter, which is attributed in part to the drastic emotional shift evoked by her marriage.
The inclusion of two "kasa" written in "hangul" in the collection is one of scholarly contention, as her authorship is in doubt. Composition in hangul was considered unworthy of expressing higher thinking of Confucian ideals, and "literary" composition in Korea was almost entirely composed in "hanmun". The distinction at the time was similar to the differences between Latin composition and vernacular prose in Renaissance Europe. Her authorship of these two pieces is supported mainly by the observation that the titles of the two "kasa" pieces, "Song of Woman's Complaint" and "Song of Coloring Nails with Touch-me-not Balsam" are very similar to two verified "hanmun" ("cheolgu" and "koshi" respectively). These claims have in part discredited by recent scholarship by O Haein ("Nansorhon shijip") and Kang Cheongseop ("Moktongga ui pogwon e taehayo"). Her poem, "Song of Autumn Night" is a characteristic example of her earlier, more fantastical and imageristic poetry. "The Young Seamstress," sometimes rendered as "Song for the Poor Girl" is one of her poems of empathy, where she sympathizes with those from poorer economic backgrounds. The third example rendered, "Woman's Grievance," exemplifies the tone of the poetry believed to have been written after her marriage. "Song of Autumn Night" is a seven-syllable "cheolgu", "The Young Seamstress" is a five-syllable "cheolgu", and "Woman's Grievance" is another seven-syllable "cheolgu."

Ercole Pasquini

Ercole Pasquini (ca. 1560 – between 1608 and 1619) was an Italian composer and organist.
Biography.
Pasquini was born at Ferrara, and studied with Alessandro Milleville (1521?-1589). He was described by Agostino Superbi (1620) as a most clever and excellent musician and organist. "He had a very nimble hand; and sometimes played so splendidly that he enraptured the people and truly amazed them." In the 1580s, Pasquini took over the musical instruction of the daughters of Giovan Battista Aleotti, court architect of Ferrara, from Milleville. 
On 1 May 1592, Pasquini became the organist of the "ridotti" of Mario Bevilacqua and of the Olivetian church, Santa Maria in Organo, in Verona. While he held these positions, he wrote and published a "favola boscareccia" entitled "I fidi amanti" (Verona, 1593) in anticipation of the wedding of Don Carlo Gesualdo and Eleonora d'Este which took place in Ferrara the following year (1594). Upon the death of Bevilacqua, Pasquini apparently returned to Ferrara, where he succeeded Luzzasco Luzzaschi as organist of the Accademia della Morte. He was succeeded in this position by Girolamo Frescobaldi. 
On 6 October 1597, Pasquini was elected organist to the Capella Giulia at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. During the summer and fall of 1604, he assumed the same position at the Santo Spirito in Sassia, continuing his duties at St. Peter's. Beginning in 1603, there appears some irregularity in his signing for his payment, from the Capella Giulia. Nicolo Pasquini, possibly a son, signed from time to time from September 1603 over the next two years. During the summer of 1605, his payments were signed by the "maestro di capella," Francesco Soriano, and in November and December, the attendant of the hospital, where Pasquini was being treated, signed. On 19 May 1608, Pasquini was dismissed from his post for "just causes." In an account by Agostino Faustini in 1646, Pasquini died insane in Rome.
Published works.
About thirty pieces for the keyboard have been preserved in manuscript copies. No autographs have survived and none were published during his lifetime. Among the items which have come down to us are 6 toccatas, 2 "durezze," 9 or 10 canzonas, 5 sets of variations, 3 dances, and an intabulation of Cipriano de Rore's madrigal "Ancor che co'l partire". These works show Pasquini to be a highly original composer, in many respects foreshadowing the keyboard works of his younger compatriot, Girolamo Frescobaldi. His "Durezze" are the earliest known of their type.
Of his vocal works, only five were published during his lifetime or shortly afterward. The madrigal "Mentre che la bell'Isse" of 1591, appears as a contrafact motet "Sanctus Sebastianus" in a Passau collection. Two motets, including the impressive ten-voice "Quem viditis pastores?," were included in a publication by his student, Raffaella Aleotti in 1593. A spiritual madrigal "M'empio gli occhi di pianto," to a text by Angelo Grillo, appeared in 1604, and the final work, published after his death, is "Jesu decus angelicum" for four voices and organ.

Cedar Haven

Cedar Haven was a historic Greek Revival plantation house located near Faunsdale, Alabama. It was built in 1850 by Phillip J. Weaver. Weaver was a prominent merchant and planter. He was born in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania in 1797 and relocated to Selma from Uniontown, Maryland in 1818. He ran a very successful store in Selma and also maintained a home there.
When the community of Woodville, near Cedar Haven, applied for a post office, the name Woodville was already in use by another Alabama community. Weaver suggested the name Uniontown and his suggestion remains as the name of the town until this day. Phillip J. Weaver was killed in Selma in 1865, purportedly by a Union soldier, several months after Wilson's Raid on Selma. The next owner of the plantation was John Davidson Alexander, born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina in 1820. He died in 1901. Cedar Haven was inherited by his son, Houston Alexander, following his death.
The house featured a two-story Doric tetrasyle portico. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1993 as a part of the Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings Multiple Property Submission. Although still standing in 2000, it has since been demolished.

Kansas City Missouri Temple

The Kansas City Missouri Temple is the 137th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It is the first to be built in the Greater Kansas City area. Previous attempts at building an LDS temple in the area failed in Independence in 1833 and Far West in 1838, after LDS founder Joseph Smith had selected and dedicated locations for their construction. A temple was completed in Independence in 1994 by the Community of Christ church, which is not affiliated with the LDS Church and does not serve the same theological functions.
Announcement and construction.
The announcement of the new temple was made on October 4, 2008 during the church's 178th Semiannual general conference by church president Thomas S. Monson. When the announcement was made, Monson did not specify whether the temple would be constructed in Kansas or Missouri. However, a later press release confirmed that the temple would be built in the Shoal Creek development in Clay County, Missouri. This was the second temple built in Missouri, after the St. Louis Missouri Temple. 
The Kansas City Missouri Temple was announced concurrently with the Philadelphia Pennsylvania, Calgary Alberta, Córdoba Argentina and Rome Italy temples.
On October 22, 2009, the Kansas City Council approved The Meadows at Searcy Creek First Plat, the subdivision of the Shoal Creek development where the temple is located. The plat includes the lot for a church meetinghouse as well as the temple. Site work in the development, including acquiring property for the future temple, commenced in late October. The official groundbreaking for the temple took place on May 8, 2010; attendance was by invitation only.
Open house and dedication.
The temple was opened to the public for an open house between April 7, 2012 - April 28, 2012. Among the visitors were Missouri governor Jay Nixon and Kansas governor Sam Brownback, who were given a private tour on April 5, 2012.
