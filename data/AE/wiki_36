Transport (SAP)

A SAP transport is a package which is used to transfer data from one SAP installation to another. This data can range from a simple printer driver to a whole SAP client. It can be considered as an "update", with the only difference being that SAP transports are made by the SAP users themselves. Transports can also be used to transfer data from external applications.
Uses.
Most of the time the SAP transports are used to implement some new features in a production system. Since a production system (especially a business-dependent one) cannot be used for development (and testing), the implementation process is divided into several phases:
The biggest drawback of the transports is that the changes they make cannot be undone, i.e. after an import goes wrong, usually another transport that corrects the original change must follow (in some cases a full system restore is needed). Despite this fact the transport system is the most convenient and effective way of implementing new features into a production system with a minimal downtime.
Construction.
A SAP transport consists of several files. These files are usually located in 5 separate folders within the OS:

Discounted cumulative gain

Discounted cumulative gain (DCG) is a measure of ranking quality. In information retrieval, it is often used to measure effectiveness of web search engine algorithms or related applications. Using a graded relevance scale of documents in a search engine result set, DCG measures the usefulness, or "gain", of a document based on its position in the result list. The gain is accumulated from the top of the result list to the bottom with the gain of each result discounted at lower ranks.
Overview.
Two assumptions are made in using DCG and its related measures.
DCG originates from an earlier, more primitive, measure called Cumulative Gain.
Cumulative Gain.
Cumulative Gain (CG) is the predecessor of DCG and does not include the position of a result in the consideration of the usefulness of a result set. In this way, it is the sum of the graded relevance values of all results in a search result list. The CG at a particular rank position formula_1 is defined as:
Where formula_3 is the graded relevance of the result at position formula_4.
The value computed with the CG function is unaffected by changes in the ordering of search results. That is, moving a highly relevant document formula_5 above a higher ranked, less relevant, document formula_6 does not change the computed value for CG. Based on the two assumptions made above about the usefulness of search results, DCG is used in place of CG for a more accurate measure.
Discounted Cumulative Gain.
The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result. The discounted CG accumulated at a particular rank position formula_1 is defined as:
Previously there has not been shown any theoretically sound justification for using a logarithmic reduction factor other than the fact that it produces a smooth reduction. An alternative formulation of DCG places stronger emphasis on retrieving relevant documents:
In Croft, Metzler and Strohman (page 320, 2010), the authors mistakenly claim that these two formulations of DCG are the same when the relevance values of documents are binary; formula_10. To see that they are not the same, let there be one relevant document and that relevant document is at rank 2. The first version of DCG equals 1 / log2(2) = 1. The second version of DCG equals 1 / log2(2+1) = 0.631. The way that the two formulations of DCG are the same for binary judgments is in the way gain in the numerator is calculated. For both formulations of DCG, binary relevance produces gain at rank i of 0 or 1. No matter the number of relevance grades, the two formulations differ in their discount of gain. Note that Croft et al. (2010) and Burges et al. (2005) present the second DCG with a log of base e, while both versions of DCG above use a log of base 2. When computing NDCG with the second formulation of DCG, the base of the log does not matter, but the base of the log does affect the value of NDCG for the first formulation. Clearly, the base of the log affects the value of DCG in both formulations.
Recently, Wang et al.(2013) give theoretical guarantee for using the logarithmic reduction factor in NDCG. Specifically, the authors prove for every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the ranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost all datasets.
Normalized DCG.
Search result lists vary in length depending on the query. Comparing a search engine's performance from one query to the next cannot be consistently achieved using DCG alone, so the cumulative gain at each position for a chosen value of formula_1 should be normalized across queries. This is done by sorting documents of a result list by relevance, producing the maximum possible DCG till position formula_1, also called Ideal DCG (IDCG) till that position. For a query, the "normalized discounted cumulative gain", or nDCG, is computed as:
The nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a search engine's ranking algorithm. Note that in a perfect ranking algorithm, the formula_14 will be the same as the formula_15 producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable.
The main difficulty encountered in using nDCG is the unavailability of an ideal ordering of results when only partial relevance feedback is available.
Example.
Presented with a list of documents in response to a search query, an experiment participant is asked to judge the relevance of each document to the query. Each document is to be judged on a scale of 0-3 with 0 meaning irrelevant, 3 meaning completely relevant, and 1 and 2 meaning "somewhere in between". For the documents ordered by the ranking algorithm as
the user provides the following relevance scores:
That is: document 1 has a relevance of 3, document 2 has a relevance of 2, etc. The Cumulative Gain of this search result listing is:
Changing the order of any two documents does not affect the CG measure. If formula_19 and formula_20 are switched, the CG remains the same, 11. DCG is used to emphasize highly relevant documents appearing early in the result list. Using the logarithmic scale for reduction, the DCG for each result in order is:
So the formula_21 of this ranking is:
Now a switch of formula_19 and formula_20 results in a reduced DCG because a less relevant document is placed higher in the ranking; that is, a more relevant document is discounted more by being placed in a lower rank.
The performance of this query to another is incomparable in this form since the other query may have more results, resulting in a larger overall DCG which may not necessarily be better. In order to compare, the DCG values must be normalized.
To normalize DCG values, an ideal ordering for the given query is needed. For this example, that ordering would be the monotonically decreasing sort of the relevance judgments provided by the experiment participant, which is:
The DCG of this ideal ordering, or "IDCG", is then:
And so the nDCG for this query is given as:

Hysterectomy Educational Resources and Services (HERS) Foundation

The Hysterectomy Educational Resources & Services (HERS) Foundation is an independent non-profit international women’s health educational advocacy organization [http://www.hersfoundation.org][http://www.uterinearteryembolization.com]. The stated mission of the organization is to give women a greater voice within the healthcare system by education and advocacy programs. HERS is financially supported by the thousands of individuals who use their services and specifically denies contributions from pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers. The HERS Foundation researches and testifies before federal agencies on such issues as drug and medical device reporting and informed consent for gynecological procedures and surgeries. HERS Newsletter provides health information on a variety of women’s health interests. They are dedicated to making information available and accessible to every individual, regardless of their ability to pay.
History.
The HERS Foundation was established in 1982 by Nora W. Coffey and Helen E. Plotkin, as a group to provide information about the alternatives to hysterectomy and the effects of the surgery. It quickly broadened to address a wide variety of women’s health issues and became a clearinghouse for women’s health information and advocacy.
In 2004, HERS led the first ever nationwide protest against hospitals in every state for a week for a year. In 2007 HERS organized opposition to National Public Radio (NPR) for allowing the underwriting on their air waves of an advertisement for robotic hysterectomy which resulted in NPR withdrawing the ad.
HERS has counseled more than 875,000 individuals and provided information to millions more worldwide via broadcast, print and the World Wide Web. The organization’s website is multilingual, offered in English, French and German. [http://www.hersfoundation.com/languages.htm]
Purpose and programs.
The foundation’s purpose is to provide comprehensive information about treatment alternatives and the effects of hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and female castration (removal of the gonads, the ovaries). They help individual women world wide by providing one-on-one telephone counseling, physician referrals, litigation support, a free lending library of books, scripts, videos, and DVD’s, 6,000 annotated medical journal articles, woman-to-woman networking, newsletters, informational pamphlets in English and Spanish, lectures and annual regional conferences [http://www.hersfoundation.org][http://hersfoundation.org/conference.html]. HERS is committed to the ideal that every woman has the right to the information required to make her own healthcare decisions. They encourage women to have candid discussions with their physicians about the effects of medical treatment and surgery. They raise public awareness of the large number of hysterectomies being performed without the information requisite for informed consent.
Ongoing projects.
"HERS 2010 Hysterectomy Conference"
U.S. Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney will be the Keynote Speaker at HERS Twenty-Eighth Hysterectomy Conference on April 24, in New York City. Maloney is well known and highly regarded for her advocacy for women’s rights. Indiana Representative Bruce Borders, the legislator who introduced a hysterectomy informed consent bill, will also speak at the conference. Borders will provide an insider’s perspective on the opposition and support he has received for Indiana House Bill 1366. In addition to meeting expert speakers and networking with other women and men seeking to become better educated about these issues, the conference is an opportunity to show politicians that hysterectomy informed consent legislation is of critical importance. http://hersfoundation.org/conference.html
"un becoming"
In February 2005 HERS produced a play about the physical, political, economic, and social impact of hysterectomy. UN BECOMING by Rick Schweikert premiered Off Broadway at the 45th Street Theatre and it has been performed in 25 other cities. In 2005 a performance of UN BECOMING with the original Off-Broadway cast was filmed by Eric Marciano and American Montage [http://www.unbecomingplay.com]. Barbara Seaman, author of "The Greatest Experiment Ever Performed on Women: Exploding the Estrogen Myth", stated, “Every woman, man and child should see this play!”
Female Anatomy: Functions of the Female Organs is a short educational video produced by the HERS Foundation in 2007 It has been viewed over 1,200,000 times on websites including YouTube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff5IOSj1l7w, Google, MSN, Yahoo and the HERS Foundation http://hersfoundation.org/.
Hysterectomy: The Experts Speak Out is a blog written by the HERS Foundation that gives the public access to the experiences of hysterectomized and castrated women told in their own unedited words. The blog provides an in-depth analysis of the patient education misinformation being given to women by doctors and hospitals and provides a platform for women to voice their experiences [http://hysterectomyinformation.blogspot.com/].
The H Word http://www.thehword.org/ written by Nora W. Coffey and Rick Schweikert, discusses the common reasons hysterectomy is recommended, the diagnostic studies that should be performed to obtain a diagnosis, alternatives in treatment and their risks, and strategies to help women cope with the lifelong aftereffects of removal of the uterus and ovaries. It revolutionizes our understanding of female anatomy and the important lifelong functions of the female organs. It reveals the solution to the complex problem of hysterectomy performed without the information that is necessary for informed consent. It takes an unflinching look at the environment of hysterectomy in America- information gynecology doesn't want you to know about 100 years of hysterectomy in America.

Cover of a 1960s song, this version achieved a huge success in France in terms of chart positions and sales. 
Song information.
In the 1960s, the Sandpipers band had a hit with "Angelica", originally recorded in English. In 1967, French singer Nicoletta made her own modified version of the song, under the title "La Musique", but this cover passed unnoticed at the time. Thirty-four years later, this version was covered by Star Academy France which decided to consider this cover as the show's anthem and the lead single from its debut album. Fourteen contestants participated in the recording of the new version which particularly puts foreword the singing.
The song became a smash success in France: it went straight to number-one on December 8, 2001, and stayed there for nine weeks. Then it dropped regularly, totalling 12 weeks in the top ten, 19 weeks in the top 50 and 24 weeks in the top 100. Certified Diamond disc by the SNEP only two weeks after its release, it is at present ranked 16th on the best-selling singles of all time chart of France.

Finch Hill

William Finch Hill was a British theatre and music hall architect of the Victorian era.
Little is known of Finch Hill's early life, he possibly obtained his early architectural experience in church building. He set himself up as 'surveyor and architect', predominantly building public houses. In 1856, he exhibited his designs for Evans Music-and-Supper Rooms, at the Royal Academy. Between 1856–70, he worked with his partner Edward Lewis Paraire (1826–1882). Together they worked on many music halls and theatres, including Weston's Music Hall (1857), the Islington Philharmonic (1860), the Oxford Music Hall (1861), the Royal Cambridge (1856, in Shoreditch), and the Britannia Theatre (1841, Hoxton) – the last of whose designs was exhibited by Paraire in 1859.
The designs showed "Finch Hill was a master of the opulent but never licentious classicism of the 1850s. Audiences knocked back their beers in sumptuous settings designed by an architect who knew the churches of Gibbs, Archer and Hawksmoor".
The partnership was based in separate houses in the same street, and on its dissolution Paraire returned to designing banks, churches and public houses.
Hill's remaining works can be seen around Museum Street, in Bloomsbury. A row of houses (with shops beneath) are Grade II listed buildings, together with the Museum Tavern, a public house.

Physiognomonics

Physiognomonics (, ) is an Ancient Greek treatise on physiognomy casually attributed to Aristotle (and part of the Corpus Aristotelicum) but now believed to be by an author writing approximately 300 BC.
Ancient physiognomy before the "Physiognomonics".
Although "Physiognomonics" is the earliest work surviving in Greek devoted to the subject, texts preserved on clay tablets provide evidence of physiognomy manuals from the First Babylonian Dynasty, containing divinatory case studies of the ominous significance of various bodily dispositions. At this point physiognomy is "a specific, already theorized, branch of knowledge" and the heir of a long-developed technical tradition.
While loosely physiognomic ways of thinking are present in Greek literature as early as Homer, physiognomy proper is not known before the classical period. The term "physiognomonia" first appears in the fifth-century BC Hippocratic treatise "Epidemics" (II.5.1). Physiognomy was mentioned in a work by Antisthenes on the Sophists, which provides evidence of its recognition as an art ("techne").
In Aristotle's time, physiognomics was acknowledged as an art ("techne") with its own skilled practitioners ("technitai"), as we see from a reference in "Generation of Animals" (IV.3): Then people say that the child has the head of a ram or a bull, and so on with other animals, as that a calf has the head of a child or a sheep that of an ox. All these monsters result from the causes stated above, but they are none of the things they are said to be; there is only some similarity, such as may arise even where there is no defect of growth. Hence often jesters compare someone who is not beautiful to a goat breathing fire, or again to a ram butting, and a certain physiognomist reduced all faces to those of two or three animals, and his arguments often prevailed on people. (trans. Pratt rev. Barnes)
Already in antiquity, physiognomy's pretensions to a "scientific" foundation were questioned and debated. It had connections to medicine, but also to magic and divination.
The treatise.
Structure and content.
The treatise is divided into sections on theory (805a1-808b10) and method (808b11-814b9). The connections between bodily features and character are treated in detail, cataloguing, for example, twelve kinds of nose, and the distinctive features of the "cinaedus".
Connections to Aristotle.
The pseudo-Aristotelian treatise begins with an allusion to Aristotle's "Prior Analytics" (II.27, on the body-soul correlation), and many of the physiognomic connections discussed are mentioned specifically in the "History of Animals".
Influence.
The author's systematic scheme of physiognomic relationships was not adopted by later writers on the subject; the proliferation of incompatible teachings had "the cumulative effect of undermining the authority of the profession as a whole."

Since rebuilding his eyes, Kernel has been able to see new lights that he cannot move, and which seem to be whispering to the Disciples, manipulating them. However Kernel realizes that he is unable to tell anyone of his concerns as no-one else can see the lights. When the whispering lights lead them to a ship where the group meet their most terrifying foe yet, 'The Shadow', Kernel guards the portal and is approached by a ball made up of the whispering lights, which tells him to leave his friends and follow it. Kernel is unwilling but is forced through the window by the sphere of lights. The sphere takes the shape of Art (Artery) - the boy Kernel once thought was his brother - to gain Kernel's trust, and reveals itself to be one of the Old Creatures.
"Art" then tells Kernel that he is needed to save the universe and is taken to the point where the Demonata's and humanity’s universe meet. Kernel is told that both universes were once a single, chess board shaped cosmos, the white squares belonging to the demons and the black belonging to the Old Creatures, the sections separated by the Kah-Gash. However a war between the two groups broke down the Kah-Gash and its soul split into three pieces. He also learns that the Kah-Gash will not destroy a single universe, but will instead bring both back to their original state. The demons and Old Creatures (being creatures of the original universe) will continue to exist thereafter, but every other living thing will be wiped out.
Having learnt this, Kernel tries to escape, but "Art" is killed and another light sphere appears, taking the form of Raz, another dead Disciple. He tells Kernel that the boy has been chosen to be 'Noah' and protect 'the Ark', a planet to which the Old Creatures have brought the best of numerous intelligent species from this universe for protection from the demons. Kernel chooses to go back and help Grubbs and Bec beat "The Shadow" (now revealed to be Death). However before Raz leaves he warns Kernel that Bec's piece of the Kah-Gash may have been corrupted by Lord Loss' possession of it (Bec’s piece was stolen from Lord Loss in the fourth book of the series) and to beware of her.
Kernel returns in the midst of a huge battle between the Disciples (including Bec and Grubbs) and an army of the Demonata. He is initially frightened of Grubbs' newly wolfen form, but soon grows used to it. Everyone exchanges stories, but Kernel senses that Grubbs is hiding something. The band of fighters and mages successfully attempt to use the Kah-Gash to defeat the oncoming hordes of demons.
Bec and Grubbs begin to disagree over whether or not to search for Beranabus' soul, and when Kernel thinks of Beranabus some lights begin to pulse - indicating that his soul can be found. Grubbs is still not happy about the idea, but when Bec reveals that Bill-E Spleen may be trapped in the same place as Beranabus, Grubbs jumps at the opportunity to save his brother. Kernel begins opening a window, but also catches a glimpse of a world where Lord Loss is talking to millions of demons. He shrugs this off and continues to build the window which leads them to a world engulfed in shadow, which they discover is in fact the 'body' of Death. The Disciples realise that their magic works differently in this place, and although sound does not travel, they can communicate telepathically thanks to Bec. Kernel can see differences in all the shadows, which then turn out to be the spirits of people, all of which seem to have gone insane, all screaming "free me!" Kernel locates Beranabus, and they talk about how to defeat Death. They are told by the ancient magician that it is impossible, after which Bec has a private discussion with Beranabus, making Grubbs and Kernel wary of her.
Beranabus tells them how to set the spirits free, thus unravelling death's physical form, but says that it will come back stronger. When Grubbs asks Kernel where Bill-E is and if Kernel could lead him to him, when Beranabus tells them quite flatly that it has taken all his effort for him not to go mad in Death and it is impossible for someone with such a weak mind to stay sane. Death then becomes aware of their presence inside it and begins to attack them, after which the group run to a side of death and begin to claw and attack it. Its body unravels and the spirits trapped inside quickly escape including Beranabus and what's left of Bill-E.
The shadows disappear and the heroes fall into the world Kernel had seen before. They are surrounded by demons, with little hope of escape. Bec, Grubbs and Kernel join to form the Kah-Gash, and create a shield, however Grubbs refuses to give it more power as it would mean he was no longer in control of it. Most of the group fight the demons while Kernel begins working on forming the window back to their universe, defended by Dervish as he does so. Meera Flame is fatally wounded but as her final act, kills herself and Juni Swan, who now has no hope of return as Death is incapacitated. Kernel opens the window and calls to everyone to follow, however Bec is in the clutches of Lord Loss and tells them to leave her.
Before they escape Kernel notices that Bec and the demon master are not fighting as violently as before, and suspects Bec of betrayal. When the remaining warriors return Dervish is in very bad shape, and asks to be taken outside to die. Kernel tells Grubbs he is returning to the ark. Grubbs says he understands and asks if Kernel would save the world "regardless of the consequences", Kernel agrees. Grubbs tells Kernel that he will hate him for what he is about to do, and then destroys Kernel's magically formed eyes and tells him that he needs him to stay. Kernel begins to warn Grubbs about Bec, but Grubbs has taken his uncle outside. The story ends with Kernel blind and alone, imagining Beranabus telling him that this is the end of the universe.
Cover Competition and Revelation.
In May 2008, Darren Shan ran a competition in which he asked fans to describe a demon in which he will use in the book. Since that was the first time that was offered to fans, the response was overwhelming. After the submissions were over, the staff at Waterstones and HarperCollins narrowed the entrants down to a shortlist of ten finalists. After Shan himself read through the final ten entries, he chose the winning Demon created by Tom Woodhead. The winner created the Sligstata, which is featured on the front cover of the book.
The runners-up for the competition are:
The signed copy of the book had a typing error in the last few words and has become a collectible together with the first books sold before the error was corrected.Sometimes there can be an error on page 51, saying that the Shadow originated in the Crux, when it should be the Old Creatures.

Henry Grant

Henry Grant (1907–2004) was a British freelance photographer who was active around London from just after World War II through the 1970s.
His work was entirely in black and white, aimed at the newspaper market. He sold as a freelance photojournalist through a Fleet Street news agency. His wife, Rose Grant, was a reporter for the popular communist newspaper The Daily Worker. Their political interests influenced his frequent choice of politically and socially significant subjects. Stylistically he was known for his spontaneous and candid photographs, often taken in the intervals between his "real" assignments.
In later years, he and Rose often collaborated in the Times Educational Supplement.
He retired professionally in 1980, but still took photographs. In 1986, his archive of 80,000 photographs was purchased by the Museum of London.
Photographs of particular note document the construction of the Festival of Britain.

Pseudo-

The prefix pseudo- (from Greek ψευδής "lying, false") is used to mark something as false, fraudulent, or pretending to be something it is not.
Biology prefix.
In biology and botany taxonomy the prefix 'pseudo' or 'pseud' can indicate a species with a visual similarity to another genus. An example is the "Iris" species "Iris pseudacorus", by having leaves similar to those of "Acorus calamus" in the "Acorus" genus, having "pseud—acorus" ('false-acorus') in its botanical name.

Law of East Timor

The law of East Timor is based on the laws of Indonesia, as was determined by the United Nations. While laws were originally published only in English, the government began enacting law solely in Portuguese in 2002. For this reason, East Timorese laws are now written in English, Portuguese, and Indonesian. The law of East Timor is enforced by the National Police, established in 2002. One of the most important events in the history of the law of East Timor was the creation of the Special Panels of the Dili District Court, which attempted to deal with crimes such as murder, rape, and torture which took place in 1999. The panels sat from 2000 to 2006.

Scowle

Scowles are landscape features which range from amorphous shallow pits to irregular labyrinthine hollows up to several metres deep and are possibly unique to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, England.
They have traditionally been interpreted as the remains of prehistoric and early historic open-cast iron ore extraction, but investigation undertaken by the Forest of Dean Archaeological Survey from 2003 to 2004 suggests that they have a primarily natural origin which has been exploited by humans.
Origin.
Scowles have developed over millions of years. They occur in a broken ring around the central part of the Forest of Dean, and are confined to particular geological outcrops of carboniferous limestone and sandstone. Ancient cave systems were formed underground, before iron-rich water from the coal measures of the central Forest area permeated from the surface and deposited iron ore in crevices. The caves were then uplifted, eroded and exposed as a surface of deep hollows and exposed rock.
Much later, humans — certainly from the Iron Age and later in the Roman period — recognised that iron ore could be found in veins and pockets in the exposed rock faces. In some places, when the surface exposures were exhausted they followed veins of iron ore underground. The ore was then smelted locally, using locally obtained charcoal, and made into objects or traded, by way of the River Wye or ports on the River Severn and its estuary. However, there is little direct evidence for dating the exploitation of iron ore from scowles.
The most likely origin of the word "scowle" is that it derives from a Brythonic word "crowll" meaning a cave or hollow, or the Welsh word "ysgil" meaning a recess. Welsh was the main language in the local area before about the 9th century.
Characteristics.
Types of scowle range from deep irregular quarry-like features to amorphous shallow hollows. Shallow depressions could be either scowles which have been backfilled, or could represent subsidence of the ground surface above old mines or natural caves. Small pits with mounds of spoil associated with them probably represent different types of iron ore extraction in the vicinity of the exposed cave system, or people prospecting for iron ore away from the main deposits. Small circular pits without associated mounds might represent natural geological features.
Ecologically, scowles are now recognised as important wildlife habitats, being home to lower plants and ferns, bats and invertebrates. However, some are threatened by illegal dumping and off-road vehicles.
Tourism and popular culture.
One of the most accessible areas of scowles is at Puzzlewood near Coleford, which is open as a tourist attraction. Over a mile of pathways were laid down in the early 19th century to provide access to the woods, and provide picturesque walks. Puzzlewood, and "Dwarf's Hill" at Lydney Park which also contains scowles, are said to have been inspirations for J. R. R. Tolkien's descriptions of Middle-earth forests in "The Lord of the Rings". Tolkien carried out archaeological work in the area in the 1920s with Mortimer Wheeler.

Frege–Church ontology

The Frege–Church ontology is an ontology, a theory of existence. Everything is considered as being in three categories, object (referent, denotation), name, or concept (sense). The ontology was developed by Alonzo Church based on ideas of Gottlob Frege to resolve some paradoxes. The ontology is related to certain modal logics.
Paradox of the name relationship.
However, Mary does not believe that Pluto is Neptune, a paradox.
The Frege–Church ontology resolves this by saying the belief introduces an "intensional context" whereby the terms following the words "believes that" are in a context whereby they refer not to the denotation of the words, but to the concept associated with the words for the believer. Each word has a name, a denotation, and a concept associated with it.
Resolution of the paradox of the name relationship using the Frege–Church ontology.
Resolution.
“The farthest planet from the sun”, as it appears in proposition (1) is Mary’s concept of “the farthest planet from the sun”, not about the actual farthest planet from the sun as it appears in (2), so the substitution cannot be done. A more rigorous and formal treatment of this is given by Church.

History.
Every Child Ministries (ECM, sometimes called ECMAfrica) was founded by John and Lorella Rouster in 1985 after serving three years in what was then Zaire with another evangelical mission. John had an agricultural background and later earned a Biblical studies certificate from Moody Bible Institute. Lorella was a teacher, Christian educator, and journalist, also an alumna of Moody Bible Institute, Tri-State University(B.A.)and Covington Theological Seminary (M.R.E.) The Rousters served a total of nine years in Zaire (now DR Congo)—a little more than three before founding ECM (1981-Spring 1984) and six with ECM (1990–1996). During this time Lorella wrote numerous books in the African Kituba language, translated songs, Gospel and health booklets, which were published by ECM. She also developed an extensive training manual for teachers of children. This book was later published in seven languages spoken in Africa: Kituba, Lingala, Tshiluba, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese.
From 1985 to 1998, Every Child Ministries served only in DR Congo and was mainly limited to Christian education, training of teachers, development of literature, and health services. In 1985 ECM was featured in the "Mission Explorers Video Series" with Carey Kinsolving. These ministries have continued and expanded under national leadership.
Since 1999 three tendencies have been noticeable: 1. Rapid expansion into other African countries, and 2. A growing tendency to focus on the needs of what the organization deems as the most marginalized and neglected children, 3. A growing emphasis on Child sponsorship.
In 1997 the Rousters returned from Congo. Floyd Bertsch had served as International Director while the Rousters were in Congo, but upon their return they again took the position of International Director, sharing the duties as co-directors.
In 1999 an evaluatory trip was made to Ghana. As a result, several initiatives were established there including the Initiative against shrine slavery ritual servitude and the Initiative for Street children.
In 2001 ECM initiated a program called "Character Building from the Bible" in some of the public schools of Ghana.
In November 2002 Haven of Hope Home/orphanage was founded. Forty-five children now find a safe haven there. Many were homeless street children, some are orphans, abandoned children, former shrine slaves and children of former slaves. The home now includes a school, Haven of Hope Academy, offering Nursery through Class 6.
In January 2003 Every Child Ministries held its first liberation of shrine slaves known as trokosi, cooperating with International Needs Ghana. This was followed by another liberation in January 2004 in cooperation with FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), a third in December 2005, and another in March 2010. ECM has been very active in advocating for the abolition of the practice and the liberation of existing slaves. In 2007 they released a DVD for their anti-slavery project called "Stomp Out Slavery" to help raise public awareness. In January 2008, ECM issued a "Prayer Guide against Modern Slavery" in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation
In 2003 ECM expanded its ministry to street children to include DR Congo, ministering to children living on Kinshasa's streets with meals twice a week, vocational training, literacy classes, sports teams, gardening and Bible classes.
The same year they introduced an in-depth method of teaching the Bible. Called "Step by Step, Slowly", the approach teaches Bible passages phrase by phrase involving a four step process—Read, Question, Act it out, Sing and Dance.
In 2006 ECM made investigatory trips into Togo, Benin, Uganda, and New Sudan, and conducted training for children’s teachers in Uganda and New Sudan.
This was followed by training for children’s teachers in Togo in 2007 and in Benin in 2008, and by the establishment of a main base of operations with numerous projects in Uganda in 2007-2008.
Current projects in Uganda include summer day camps and holiday parties for children in IDP camps, an initiative to help albino children and improve public acceptance of them, and "The Way Home" Project targeting AIDS orphans. "The Way Home" project began in 2010 with assistance to "grannies" raising several grandchildren who were orphaned due to AIDS.
Missiological distinctives.
Every Child Ministries is a nonsectarian Christian mission of evangelical persuasion. Its members come from many different Christian churches. It is a hands-on type mission making extensive use of volunteers and involving people from many different backgrounds. As a mission agency ECM sends both career and short-term missionaries and widely supports the work of African nationals.
Memberships and affiliations.
Every Child Ministries has been a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability since 1987., the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance, and Mission Network News. It is also a member of STEER, a group that involves agriculturalists in mission support. 
Since 1997, ECM has participated in the triennial Urbana (convention) Student Missions Conference, where Co-Director Lorella Rouster taught a 2006 seminar on “Healing the Children of War.” The organization has also regularly participated in the Greater Chicago Sunday School Association, where they have presented many workshops for teachers. In 2005 they were the featured international ministry at the Children's Pastor's Conferences sponsored by the International Network of Children's Ministry.

Boston College sacked K-State quarterback Chad May eight times, including a four-hit effort by end Mike Mamula, who was named the game's most valuable player.
Kansas State rushed for just 30 yards, and threw for 94 more, for a total of 124 yards.
K-State's only score came with eight seconds left in the first quarter when Joe Gordon crashed the middle of BC's line and blocked a punt by Jeff Beckley. Chris Sublette recovered the ball on the first hop in the end zone and the game was tied, 7-7.
However, BC would answer with its own end zone patrol later in the half when Mamula applied the biggest of his hits on May for a safety with 2:37 left.
Still, a defense that featured punter Eric Hardy, Gordon, and a pair of 10-tackle performances from Chuck Marlowe and Mario Smith kept the Wildcats within striking distance until the end.
BC tacked on a 35-yard field goal by David Gordon with 1:18 remaining in the game to seal the win for the Eagles.

Me and Maxx is an American sitcom broadcast on NBC starting in 1980. The plot involved a young girl, Maxx (Melissa Michaelsen), moving in with her dad, Norman (Joe Santos), who had created a life for himself as a swinging bachelor.
Casting.
Michaelsen and Santos were picked for the roles when a commercial starring Joe aired during one of Melissa's early projects. NBC president Fred Silverman saw the commercial while watching Melissa's TV-movie and reportedly said "I want that guy with that girl."

James T. Holtzclaw

James Thadeus Holtzclaw (December 17, 1833 – July 19, 1893) was an Alabama lawyer, railroad commissioner, and general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He played a prominent role of several major engagements of the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater.
Early life and career.
James T. Holtzclaw was born in McDonough in rural Henry County, Georgia, in the winter of 1833. His parents, Elijah and Mary Holtzclaw, were from Chambers County, Alabama, where young Holtzclaw was raised and educated. He obtained his primary education at the local Presbyterian high school, East Alabama Institute, in Lafayette. 
In 1853, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy, but declined and did not formally enter the school. In December, he began to study law in Montgomery, Alabama, under the famed pro-secession "Fire-Eater" William Lowndes Yancey. He passed his bar exam in 1855, and established a private practice in Montgomery, Alabama. A fellow lover of fine horses, he became a lifelong friend and supporter of Yancey. He married Mary A. "Molly" Cowles, a daughter of another prominent Montgomery resident.
Civil War service.
At the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, Holtzclaw served as a lieutenant in a local militia company, the Montgomery True Blues. He participated in the capture of the U.S. Navy yard in Pensacola, Florida. In May, he enlisted in the Confederate army as a lieutenant in the 18th Alabama Infantry. In August of that same year, he was promoted to major and then in December to lieutenant colonel.
In April 1862 at the Battle of Shiloh in Western Tennessee, Holtzclaw was seriously wounded in his right lung during the first day of fighting. He was initially thought to have been mortally wounded, but made an amazing recovery and was back in his duties after only ninety days. He was promoted to colonel and served for a time in Montgomery. In 1863, he was again wounded, this time when he was thrown from his horse during the Battle of Chickamauga in northern Georgia. However, the injury was not serious enough to force him from the field. In November 1863, he assumed command of a brigade in Stewart's Division in Second Corps of the Army of Tennessee and led it during the Chattanooga Campaign, including the Battle of Lookout Mountain. For a time, he temporarily led the brigade of Henry Clayton.
On July 7, 1864, Holtzclaw received a promotion to brigadier general and assumed permanent command of Clayton's Brigade. He took part in John Bell Hood's campaign in Tennessee and was wounded a third time, this time a severe contusion on his ankle, during the Battle of Franklin on December 17. However, he maintained his duties and his brigade acted as rear guard for the army following the disastrous Battle of Nashville.
In January 1865, he was assigned command of a division comprising his brigade and that of Mathew Ector in the Department of the Gulf and the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and Eastern Louisiana. Subsequently, Holtzclaw assumed command of the garrison at Spanish Fort and led the defenses of Mobile and Montgomery against Union forces. Following the collapse of the Confederacy, he was paroled on May 10 in Meridian, Mississippi, and formally pardoned on November 4.
Postbellum activities.
Holtzclaw resumed his legal career in the firm of Judge & Holtzclaw in Montgomery and became prominent in the local and state Democratic Party. He took an interest in the railroad industry and served as an associate state railroad commissioner shortly before his death. He was also the grand commander of the local chapter of the Freemasons.
James T. Holtzclaw died at his home in Montgomery at the age of sixty and is buried in the city's Oakwood Cemetery.

Jean-Claude Latombe (born May 14, 1947) is a French-American roboticist and the Kumagai Professor in the School of Engineering at Stanford University. Latombe is a world-renowned researcher in robot motion planning, and has authored one of the most highly cited books in the field.
Biography.
Latombe received his dual-Engineering Degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the National Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble (now Grenoble Institute of Technology) in 1969 and 1970, respectively, and a M.S. in electrical engineering in 1972, with the thesis "Design of a Computer-Aided Instruction System in Electrical Engineering". In 1977, Latombe received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Grenoble with a thesis "Artificial Intelligence for Design Automation".
He joined the faculty of INPG in 1980, and left in 1984 to join the Industry and Technology for Machine Intelligence (ITMI), a company he co-founded in 1982. In 1987, Latombe joined Stanford University as an Associate Professor, and have since been the Professor (1992), Chairman (1997–2000), and Kumagai Professor (2001–Present) in the Department of Computer Science.
Work.
Latombe is an important figure in robotic motion planning. After Mark Overmars published the Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) in 1992, Latombe and Lydia Kavraki independently developed the algorithm in 1994, and their joint paper with Overmars, "Probabilistic roadmaps for path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces", is considered one of the most influential studies in motion planning, and has been widely cited (more than 1000 times as of 2008). More recently, Latombe has applied his knowledge in robotics to structural biology problems, and developed the PRM-based Stochastic Roadmap Simulation (SRS) to efficiently generate and analyze large collections of protein trajectories.

Striped flea beetle

The striped flea beetle (Phyllotreta striolata) is a small flea beetle, shiny black with a greenish tinge, 1.5 to 2.5 mm long, having a wavy amber line running the length of each elytron (wing cover). It is a pest of cabbage and other brassicas. The hind legs are thickened, enabling the beetle to jump like a flea when disturbed. 
The minute, oval to elongate white eggs are laid in the soil close to the host plant. The white, brown-headed larva, when fully grown, is 3.2 to 5.0 mm long. It has three pairs of tiny legs near its head. The white pupa is approximately the same size and shape as the adult.
Eurasian in origin, the striped flea beetle is common throughout the eastern and Pacific areas of the United States (though not in much of the Rocky Mountain region), as well as in South Africa. 
Although the larvae live in the soil, feeding on the roots of host plants, they are not significant pests. Rather, the primary damage is caused by adult beetles feeding on the foliage. With their chewing mouthparts, beetles make small round pits in the cotyledons and leaves of young plants. As the plants grow, the remaining thin layers of tissue eventually dry up and fall away, leaving small "shot holes" in the foliage. This type of injury is capable of killing young plants. The seedlings may be killed if severe damage occurs. In addition, beetles may act as vectors of plant disease. 
Striped flea beetles overwinter among debris in and around fields. Emerging early in spring, they attack seedlings and young plants. Eggs are deposited in tiny crevices gnawed out of the base of host plant stems. About ten days later, the grubs hatch from the eggs and move into the soil to attack roots. After feeding for three or four weeks, the larvae pupate for seven to ten days. A new generation of beetles then emerges. Generations can be continual in warmer climates, recurring at least twice a year.
Cultivation practices and the use of resistant crop varieties help prevent severe flea beetle infestations. Seedbeds are covered with strips of a thin transparent gauze to protect seedlings from adult feeding before transplanting. Good weed control and the destruction of crop residue in and around fields reduce overwintering populations. After harvest, fields are plowed to expose larvae. For quick control of large populations attacking young seedlings, insecticide sprays are the only alternatives. 
Biological pest control can be introduced to fight the beetle. Many other beetle species act as parasitoids, attacking the pest beetle. These parasitoids include the braconid wasps "Microtonus epitricis", "M. punctulatae", "M. vittatae" and "Townesilitus psylliodis". Among biological insecticides, the nematode species "Steinernema feltiae" and "S. carpocapsae" show promise.
The use of resistant plant varieties may reduce injury by existing beetles. Resistant cabbage varieties include 'Stein's Early Flat Dutch', 'Mammoth Red Rock', 'Savoy Perfection Drumhead', and 'Ferry's Round Dutch'. 'Vates and Georgia' is a resistant collard variety. 'Florida Broadleaf' is a resistant mustard plant, and 'American Purple Top' is a resistant rutabaga. Resistant cauliflower varieties include 'Snowball A' and 'Early Snowball X'. Varieties of broccoli resistant to the beetle include 'DeCicco', 'Coastal', 'Italian Green Sprouting' and 'Atlantic' and resistant kale varieties include 'Dwarf Siberian', 'Dwarf Green Curled Scotch', and 'Early Siberian'.

Emirati cuisine

Emirati cuisine is a blend of many Middle Eastern and Asian cuisines.
The modern diet of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is cosmopolitan, featuring dishes from around the world. A lot of people confuse Levantine food as being Emirati/Khaleej, but shawarma, hummous, tabbouleh, and mixed grill, whilst having similar characteristics, are fairly recent additions and do not do justice to the "soul food" that makes up the Emirati menu.
The dishes are usually like stews, as everything is often cooked in a single pot. Saffron, cardamom, turmeric, and thyme are the core flavors used in Emirati cookery. The introduction of rice to the diet came when the traders moved to the region. Leaves from indigenous trees, such as the Ghaff, were also used to stuff small birds, releasing their flavor during the cooking process.
Breakfast in the UAE usually features breads like "raqaq", "khameer", and "chebab", served with cheese, date syrup, or eggs. These were made over a curved hot plate, resembling a stone, which would have been used by the Bedouins. "Balaleat" is another dish, but its advent again with the traders, who introduced pasta.
Sweet options include "luqeymat", a deep fried ball of pancake batter that is rolled in sesame seeds and then drizzled with date syrup. Other desserts include "khabeesa", which is flour bread crumbs blended with sugar, cardamom, and saffron or bethitha, a semolina blended with crushed dates, cardamom, and clarified butter.
At the close of the meal, it is usual to be served with a red tea infused with mint, which aids the digestion. Other traditions to the meal include a welcome with dates and "gahwah" (Arabic coffee), which are offered on arrival and are kept available through the guests visit.
Food.
Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries. The United Arab Emirates cuisine is a reflection of a great Arabian heritage and vast exposure to civilizations over time. Muslims are prohibited from eating pork, so it is not included in Arab menus. Meat, fish, and rice are the staple foods of the Emirati cuisine. Lamb and mutton are the more favored meats, then goat and beef.
Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be supplemented with cardamom, saffron, or mint to give it a distinct flavor.
Hotels frequently have pork substitutes such as beef sausages and veal rashers on their breakfast menus. If pork is available, it is clearly labelled as such. 
Alcohol is generally only served in hotel restaurants and bars (but not in Sharjah). All nightclubs and golf clubs are permitted to sell alcohol. Specific supermarkets may sell pork, but are sold in separate sections.

<doc id="19542581" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19542581" title="Offstage brass and percussion">
Offstage brass and percussion

An offstage brass and percussion part is a sound effect used in classical music, which is created by having one or more trumpet players (also called an offstage trumpet call), horn players, or percussionists from a symphony orchestra or opera orchestra play a note, melody, or rhythm from behind the stage. This creates a distant, muted effect which composers use to suggest "celestial voices", melancholy, or nostalgia, or to create a haunting effect.
History.
In Act III of Berlioz's opera "Les Troyens", a group of offstage trumpets plays a distorted-sounding fanfare along with cornets to create an unusual dramatic effect. In Beethoven's overture for "Leonore Overture" and in "Fidelio" he used an offstage trumpet call.
In Respighi's "The Pines of Rome", he uses an offstage trumpet for "Pines Near a Catacomb"; after the low strings play solemn chords, and the trombones play a simple, ancient-sounding Gregorian chant-style melody, an offstage trumpet introduces the piece's second theme. Richard Strauss used offstage trumpets during a battle scene in "Ein Heldenleben" ("A Hero's Life"). Aaron Copland's "Quiet City" used an offstage trumpet. Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2 uses an offstage brass ensemble of trumpets, French horns, and percussion. While the offstage trumpet's distant sound can create an emotional effect, critic Maurice Brown warned in 1971 that it can become an overused cliché.
Performance challenges.
Offstage music performed in the theater as an effect in a play is often less problematic than performing offstage music with an orchestra. In a theater context, the offstage sound effects are less likely to have to be synchronized exactly with other rhythms or pitches. For example, in some Shakespeare plays, the script calls for an offstage bugle call to indicate that enemy soldiers are in the distance. This cue does not have to be aligned with any other pitches or rhythms; it only needs to occur within the correct part of a scene, so a leeway of several seconds is acceptable.
Performing offstage music that has to be in sync with a larger ensemble on the stage involves potential problems with rhythm and pitch, because a difference of even a part of a second or a fraction of a semitone of pitch will be noticeable to the audience. If the conductor wants a truly muted and distant sound, the offstage player needs to be behind the stage or in an adjoining hall, not merely standing in the wings of the stage. If the offstage player is in an adjoining hallway or room behind the stage area, they may not be able to see the conductor or hear the orchestra. Even if they can hear the orchestra, their perception of the pitch and timing may be affected by the distance and refraction of the sound. If trumpet or French horn players attempt to tune their notes by ear to the orchestra pitch that they hear, their pitch may sound flat to the audience and conductor even if it is "correct" to the trumpeter or French hornists' ear, because a brass instrument's pitch varies over a long distance, and thus may sound flat in comparison to the orchestra.
To overcome these issues, conductors sometimes have an assistant who cues the offstage player, but this can result in miscues or time lags. These problems have led to a number of humorous anecdotes in the 19th and early 20th century, such as the case cited by Sir Malcolm Arnold, in which he jokes about a performance of Beethoven's "Leonore Overture" in which the offstage trumpet part was "conspicuous by its absence", because the backstage performer misunderstood the cue, and failed to play. Since the 1980s, both of these challenges have been surmounted with technology. To ensure that the offstage performer is in rhythm with the orchestra, a closed-circuit TV can be set up backstage to transmit video feed of the conductor's moving stick and hands. To ensure that the offstage performer is in pitch with the rest of the orchestra, the offstage performer can play while watching an electronic tuner which indicates whether they are sharp or flat.

Obando Church

The Obando Church or the Church of Obando (also known as the San Pascual de Baylon Parish Church) is one of the oldest and most historic churches in the Philippines. Its parish is located at the town of Obando in the province of Bulacan, on the island of Luzon. Founded by Franciscan missionaries, under the Spanish flag, it is a place where the three-day Obando Fertility Rites are held annually, in honor of three patron saints, namely: St. Pascual Baylon, St. Claire of Assisi and the Our Lady of Salambao, a celebration that was mentioned by Jose Rizal, the Philippine national hero, in the pages of his Spanish-language novel, the "Noli Me Tangere" (in "Chapter 6: Captain Tiago"). During the month of May, parishioners and other devotees perform the three-day Obando Dance (formerly known as the "Kasilonawan", now locally called "Sayaw sa Obando", literally "dance [held at Obando") inside the church, followed by a street procession.
Structure.
Its façade had been described as similar to that of the church of Marilao, Bulacan. The edifice is composed of windows and flat columns, and has a pediment with a niche and two round windows at the sides. The façade is also flanked by an octagonal belltower. Connected to its structure is the Colegio de San Pascual Baylon, a private school managed by the parish. The altar of the church is believed to be gilded with silver.
History.
The Obando Church was built by the Franciscan Order, headed by Rev. P. Manuel de Olivencia, the first curate of Obando, on April 29, 1754. The church was destroyed by joint Filipino and American ground troops during World War II in 1945, but was later rebuilt through the efforts of Rev. Fr. Marcos C. Punzal with the help of local Obandeño parishioners. Other parish priests who also managed the Obando Church since the 1900s include: Rev. Fr. Juan Dilag, Rev. Fr. Padre Exequiel Morelos, Rev. Fr. Ricardo Pulido, Rev. Msgr. Rome R. Fernandez, Rev. Fr. Marcelo K. Sanchez, Rev. Fr. Danilo G. delos Reyes, and Rev. Fr. Avelino A. Sampana. It was Rev. Fr. Rome Fernandez, with the assistance from the Cultural Commission of Obando, who revived the celebration of the Obando Fertility Rites or the Obando Dance in 1972. This was after a prohibition of the practice was imposed by an archbishop of Manila after World War II.
Current status.
The Church of Obando has been declared as the "Diocesan Shrine" of the Our Lady of the Immaculate Concepcion of Salambao (the long name for the Our Lady of Salambao) by the Catholic Church. The church is connected to several barangay chapels in Obando, Bulacan, namely: the chapels of Barangays Panghulo, Catanghalan, Pag-asa, Paliwas, San Pascual, Hulo, Mahabang-Lawa (or Lawa), Tawiran, Wawang-Pulo, Liputan, and Ubihan. Two former chapels that now have parochial church statuses include the Santa Cruz Parish in Barangay Paco and the Parish of Nuestra Señora de Salambao (the Parish of Our Lady of Salambao) of Barangay Binuangan. Both are still within the political boundaries of present-day Obando, Bulacan. Thus, there are now three parishes in Obando, Bulacan, each with their own parochial churches: those of Barangays Paco and Binuangan, in addition to the Parish of San Pascual Baylon (the Obando Church). At present, these parishes are jointly managed by three parish priests and one parochial vicar. The current parish priests are Rev. Fr. Avelino Sampana (Obando Church parish), Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Villacorta (Paco parish), Rev. Fr. Jeffrey Zuñiga (Binuangan parish), and Rev. Fr. Irvin Hizon (parochial vicar for the Obando Church parish).

The film starts with a happy small family of Hoovaiah (Dr.Vishnuvardhan) and Kanaka (Suhasini) having a small field growing flowers of Mallige, Sampige and other flowers which spread fragrance. The couple have three daughters in a small village of Jenu Koppa. Hoovaiah stands true to his devotion to Gandhi philosophy of Satyagraha come whatever may facing with nonchalance and non-violence. Globalization companies cause problems for the village as there are rich mine deposits nearby. Hoovaiah, zamindar of Jenu Koppa village, is a flower seller.Villagers revere him. When the government gives an MNC the licence to acquire land for mining in Jenukoppa, he strongly opposes it. But Kurupayya (Rangayana Raghu) joins hands with politicians and officials and tries to brainwash people to sell their land for a huge amount. Police atrocities and lathi charges on villagers force Hoovaiah to fight a lone battle against land acquisition. Fed up by the turn of events, all villagers decide to leave the village.But Hoovaiah launches a hunger strike to save the village and finally wins the battle.
The Completeness.
It shows the everlasting marriage customs of Indian culture crafted with a small incidence taking place between husband and wife wherein Hoovaiah Dr.Vishnuvardhan tries to catch a "Chitte" or butterfly unsuccessfully throughout the movie which also becomes a metaphor when it comes to their own offsprings.
The story also depicts the Indian melodrama of diversity of woman folks. The two daughters who become literate in medium of English - synonymous with globalization and not education pursue their interests and leave their family and motherland as they have to display convictions to their decisions. The third daughter although is illiterate is shown as well educated when it comes to human values.
The tough Mother played by Suhasini depicts character of a rural household hardworking wife with all the knowledge given by her folk customs. The main story revolves around Hoovaiah fighting for the preservation of his motherland and culture and showing people that money in fact is just a cover of illusion when it means to earn them by selling their own Aatma or Self.
Dialogues.
Many dialogues get accolades from audience when
Overall the movie revolves round the man who tries to get everyone into him as he grows his thoughts whenever he is faced with a challenge, but in the meanwhile he has to avoid his own saplings of frgrance somewhere on the way, and also lose some, but spreading his heart he not only wins over others but also with his own self and limitations.
The movie will also be remembered for being one of very rare commercial movies which geniunely tries to address the problems of farmers such as unjudicial exploitation of cultivating lands by globalised companies.
The character played by 'Dr.Vishnuvardhan' would also be the best in his film career next to that of "Mutthina Haara".
Critical Reception.
The film got positive reviews upon its release. Reddiff.com gave 4/5 stars saying "Maathaad Maathaadu Mallige is not a film with slow paced narration; it is a commercial film with a good message. A must-see film.". Times of India gave 4/5 stars and wrote "VISHNUVARDHAN'S brilliance and an excellent script by Nagathihalli Chandrasekhar make Mathad Mathadu Mallige a film worth watching". Indiaglitz.com gave score 8/10 stating "This is not just a film. Film that is food for thought too! It is an awakening cinema and clarion call for the villagers and farmers."
Soundtrack.
The official soundtrack contains 9 songs composed by Mano Murthy with lyrics penned by Nagathihalli Chandrashekhar and Gollahalli Shivprasad.

Proposed incinerator.
The Hong Kong government proposed to build an Integrated Waste Management Facilities at a reclaimed island on Shek Kwu Chau. The facilities will involve the creation of an artificial island south of Shek Kwu Chau and west of Cheung Chau. The facilities are expected to be completed in 2018 should the Legislative Council's finance committee approve the funding. The government expects the incinerator will be able to treat about 3,000 tonnes of waste a day. Secretary for the Environment Edward Yau said the site was chosen over Tsang Tsui in Tuen Mun partly because of the shorter transportation time and the lower impact on the neighborhood.
On 26 July 2013, the High Court rejected a legal bid to stop the government building an incinerator at Shek Kwu Chau. But the plaintiff, Cheung Chau resident Leung Hon-wai, has indicated that he may appeal.

Bruce Conforth

Bruce Michael Conforth (born approximately half way through the 20th century in Paterson, New Jersey) was the first curator of Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and is presently a lecturer of American Culture at the University of Michigan.
Early years.
Conforth was born September 3 in Paterson, New Jersey, and grew up in New Jersey and New York City. He became an artist and musician at an early age. In 1966 he appeared on an album called ""It's Happening Here"" as the bass player for a band called The Nightwatch. The liner notes read as follows:
"'Too Long - The Nightwatch
"Here is another composition from the repertoire of the talented Bob Carnevale-Roy Francia writing team. Bob sings lead vocal on this one and also does some interesting work on rhythm guitar. (Bob prefers an acoustic guitar with electric pickup for rhythm work, due to its original sound.) Roy, also a fine classical guitarist, does lead guitar and second vocal. Bassman for the Nightwatch is Bruce Conforth, who is also a prolific poet and artist. Skip Daly creates a good solid beat on the drums."
He was also an athlete in high school, winning several letters and medals for his abilities as a long jumper, quarter-miler, and a member of the mile-relay team.
The 1960s.
Conforth joined the early 1960s folk scene in New York City's Greenwich Village. He knew, and studied with performers such as Dave Van Ronk, Happy and Artie Traum, Izzy Young, Reverend Gary Davis, and Allen Ginsberg. He frequented Izzy Young's Folklore Center, the Fretted Instruments music center, The Cafe Au Go Go, Cafe Wha? (where Jimi Hendrix performed as Jimi James and the Blue Flames), The Balloon Farm in the East Village (which later became the Electric Circus), the 8th Street Bookstore, and Washington Square Park.
During this time he also made the acquaintance of Drs. Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (better known as Ram Dass), and began his interest in altered states of consciousness. 
Conforth received a scholarship to art school after graduation from high school and while enrolled spent one summer as an apprentice to the American abstract expressionist Willem de Kooning at the latter's Springs, New York studio.
He had several shows of his work but then seems to have dropped painting to turn his attention to music. He played with several bands during this time, although their exact names are unknown (much time and speculation has been devoted to identifying the names of these bands).
The 1970s.
Conforth was a member of a band called Ruby and the Dykes, which toured the East Coast. He also played with a band called The Shook, and was a friend of John Sinclair manager of the MC5.
In 1973 he was the editor of a short-lived literary magazine called "Slowglass" whose contributors included Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, and John Lennon.
In 1977 he appeared as "Josh Hawkins" (part of the duet Bates and Hawkins) on an album called "Ragtime, Blues and Jive" (also featuring fiddle great Kenny Kosek) and performed under that name around the East Coast (New York's Gerde's Folk City, The Bitter End) and at the Middletown Folk Festival in Middletown, New Jersey.
The 1980s.
In 1980 Conforth began attending graduate school at Indiana University, where he majored in folklore, ethnomusicology, and American Studies. He married the former Jeanne Harrah and they combined their last names; for the next decade he was known as Bruce Harrah-Conforth. He continued to play music, appearing in a local band called The Extremes. While at Indiana University he worked at the University's Archives of Traditional Music, contributing a number of articles to their newsletter "Resound". More importantly it was through his work at the Archives that he became involved with the still relatively unknown collection of African-American folk recordings of Lawrence Gellert. He produced two albums of songs from this collection. The first, in 1982, was on Rounder Records,"Cap'n You're So mean" (RR#4013 ) was recognized by the Library of Congress as one of that year's most outstanding folk recordings. The second, "Nobody Knows My Name" was issued by the English company Heritage Records (HT304 ) in 1984. 
Norm Cohen reviewed these albums for The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 99, No. 391 (Jan. - Mar., 1986), pp. 102–117
Cap'n You're So Mean: Negro Songs of Protest, Vol. 2 (Rounder 4013). Twenty-four previously unpublished field recordings mostly of protest songs, collected in the southern states in the 1920s
and 1930s by Lawrence Gellert. [...]
Gellert's field collecting in the south, which resulted in some remarkably candid protest material (the genuineness of which was at one time questioned) has been neglected too long. (An album he prepared for publication in the 1940s was not issued until 40 years later [...]. If ever an album required and deserved extensive documentation, this is it - and not because we still doubt its authenticity. Happily, Conforth has now found Gellert's original fieldnotes. [...] Another [...] package of Gellert collectanea, also edited by Conforth, is nonprotest material, Nobody Knows My Name (Heritage HT 304).
Conforth wrote his 1984 Master's thesis on the collection: "Laughing Just to Keep from Crying: Afro-American Folksong and the Field Recordings of Lawrence Gellert"
In 1985 Conforth completed his PhD, which was titled "The Rise and Fall of a Modern Folk Community: Haight-Ashbury 1965-1967." It contains many interviews with the founding musicians of the "San Francisco Sound."
Altered States of Consciousness Research.
During the 1980s Harrah-Conforth became involved in researching the use of light and sound stimulation in inducing altered states of consciousness in humans. He produced a work titled "Accessing Alternity" that described the history of man's quest into this area. His research into this field has been cited as a hallmark of its kind. In "A History of Light and Sound", Michael Hutchison wrote:
"In 1990 Bruce Harrah-Conforth, Ph.D., of Indiana University completed a controlled study...The report by Harrah-Conforth suggests that sound and light devices may cause simultaneous ergotropic arousal, or arousal of the sympathetic nervous system and the cerebral cortex, associated with 'creative' and 'ecstatic experiences,' and trophotropic arousal, or the arousal of the parasympathetic system, associated with deep relaxation and 'the timeless, "oceanic" mode of the mystic experience.' In humans, Dr. Harrah-Conforth concludes, 'these two states may be interpreted as hyper- and hypo- arousal, or ecstasy and samadhi.'"
Harrah-Conforth wrote in Megabrain Report: "I have little doubt that brain entrainment technology is a highly effective means of inducing changes in consciousness. [...] The evolution of human consciousness is a tangibly manipulable process. We can control our destiny. It would appear as though brain entrainment will be among the technologies leading the way."
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
In May 1991 Conforth became the curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland. His initial duties were to create the collections for the Museum. Among the artists he worked with were The Allman Brothers, The Grateful Dead, Yoko Ono, Ringo Starr, U2, Eric Clapton, Ray Charles, B. B. King, The Everly Brothers, The Kinks, Jeff Beck, Tom Petty, The Yardbirds, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Eric Burdon, Dire Straits, Neil Young, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Cash, The Beach Boys, The Doors, James Brown, Carl Perkins, and The Eagles, some of whom he had known during his own days as a performer. The early years of the Rock Hall saw some tensions develop friction between the two boards of directors: one in Cleveland made of local businessmen, and one in New York City (the location of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation) populated by industry executives such as Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records and Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone Magazine. With the construction of the building almost complete, Conforth left the job. He was alleged to have written a tell-all book called "Don't Rock the Hall" but the work has never been published.
The 1990s: The Himalayas, Tibetan Buddhism, and Castalia II.
After leaving the Museum, Conforth was appointed one of six "founding faculty" designated to create the programs for a "New College of Global Studies" being created by Radford University in Radford, Virginia. While there he worked with noted neuro-psychologist Dr. Karl Pribram at his Center for Brain Research. 
In 1995 Conforth took his first trip to Nepal and immediately developed a deep interest in the region and in the religion of Tibetan Buddhism. For the following five years he worked as a trekking guide in that area, during which time he conducted extensive ethnographic research with the Yeti population of northern Nepal. The New College eventually closed when Virginia Governor George Allen stripped its budget.
In 1996 Conforth founded, with his third wife Cynthia Swartz (since divorced), Castalia II, an organization dedicated to the exploration of consciousness. Board members included Dr. Timothy Leary, Dr. Charles Tart, Dr. John Beresford (of the Albert Hofmann Foundation), Alfred E. Neuman, physicist Dr. Fred Alan Wolf, and other "psychedelic" notables.
Current career.
In 2000, Conforth was appointed Director of the Jewel Heart Center for Tibetan Buddhism and Culture in Ann Arbor, Michigan, founded by the Buddhist teacher, Gelek Rinpoche. He also began teaching part-time at the University of Michigan. After the 9/11 tragedy, with charitable donations drying up, he left Jewel Heart in 2004 and became a full-time member of the University's Program in American Culture.
Conforth teaches folklore, blues music, popular culture, and the history of social movements at the University of Michigan and is, apparently, a popular teacher.
His current work includes researching the life of bluesman Robert Johnson; a recent publication concerns Isaiah "Ike" Zimmerman, Johnson's main guitar mentor.
On March 14, 2012, it was announced that Professor Conforth would be the 2012 recipient of the University of Michigan's Golden Apple Award for outstanding teaching.
In May 2013 Conforth's book "African American Folksong and American Cultural Politics: The Lawrence Gellert Story" was published by Scarecrow Press, an imprint of Rowman and Littlefield publishers. It has been included as one of the 100 most important books on American music.

1993 Copper Bowl

The 1993 edition to the Copper Bowl featured the Wyoming Cowboys and the Kansas State Wildcats.
K-State capped off its most successful season in 83 years, with its first-ever bowl game victory. The 20th ranked Kansas State Wildcats, making only their second bowl appearance in school history, defeated the Wyoming Cowboys, 52-17. 
Wyoming took a quick 3-0 lead on a 35-yard field goal, but K-State put its high-powered offense into overdrive and scored on its first three possessions. J.J. Smith put K-State on the board with a two-yard TD run and Tate Wright added a 22-yard field goal before K-State drove 76 yards on its third possession to take a 16-3 edge on a Chad May TD plunge. All-American Andre Coleman closed out the first half with a 68-yard punt return to put K-State ahead 24-10 at the break then blew things open with a 61-yard touchdown catch just 54 seconds into the third quarter.
Freshman All-American Kevin Lockett put K-State ahead 38-10 midway through the third quarter with a 30-yard touchdown reception before reserve running back Leon Edwards added a 13-yard touchdown run and cornerback Kenny McEntyre provided the game’s crowning moment with a 37-yard interception return for a score.
Andre Coleman racked up a career-high 283 yards of total offense, tying or breaking three Copper Bowl records along the way. Quarterback Chad May threw for 275 yards and two touchdowns, including the picture-perfect 30-yarder to wide receiver Kevin Lockett on a fourth-down play in the fourth quarter.

1994 Winchester 400

The silver-anniversary Featherlite Trailers Winchester 400 motor race (run yearly since 1970) was held under All-Pro Series sanction on October 2, 1994, at the Winchester Speedway, Indiana (USA).
For the second consecutive year, Mike Cope was the winner of the Featherlite Trailers Winchester 400, this time passing young Toby Porter with three laps remaining in the race. Cope became the third driver to win back-to-back 400's and the first since Mark Martin performed the feat in 1986 and 1986.
The race.
Toby Porter, in his Greased Lightning sponsored machine was the fastest among the 31 cars that took a lap in qualifying. Starting alongside Porter on the front row, Cope cruised to the lead for the first 91 laps. Scot Walters, Hal Goodson, Porter, Jody Ridley, Brian Rievley, and Bobby Gill would all take turns trading the lead with Cope over the first 300 of the 400 laps.
Cope elected to stop for tires prior to the final restart of the race, as Porter gambled and hoped to hold off all challengers on old tires. On the restart with 23 laps remaining, Cope had a scare heading into the first corner. A lapped car pushed up the racetrack and into Cope nearly sending both cars into the outside wall. Rebounding from the contact, Cope passed Rievley for third with 14 laps to go, he blew by Walters for second and set his sights on the race leader. With three laps remaining, Cope zipped past Porter for the lead. Trying to fight back, Porter lost control and spun in the fourth turn, narrowly missing the outside wall. With series rules dictating a green-flag finish, the race distance was extended for the first time in history. Cope was never challenged on the restart, crossing the finish line on lap 403, two lengths ahead of Walters in second, with Rievley third, and Porter settling for fourth, all on the lead lap. Ron Young was fifth, two laps behind the leaders. Cope collected $13,350 for winning the 25th annual running of the "400".

Subterranean Animism

Gameplay.
Subterranean Animism features two playable characters, each with three weapon types representing a youkai assisting them from above ground. Like "Mountain of Faith", collecting power items adds up to four "option" satellites around the character (or eight for the Marisa/Alice combination), which behave differently according to the character and weapon type, and can be sacrificed for a bomb effect. However, unlike "Mountain of Faith", each bomb has a different behaviour, and some cause special gameplay effects to occur.
The scoring system is once again based on "grazing", the act of positioning the player as close as possible to the bullets without being hit, coupled with collection of two types of items dropped by enemies. Overall, the system resembles some of the core elements of "Embodiment of Scarlet Devil" fused together with the Tension Bonus System from the "Shikigami no Shiro" series. As such, the player is urged to actively graze at every possible opportunity in order to increase the point item value and not let it drop. Grazing large amounts of bullets in little time, thus filling the "communication gauge" on the bottom left corner, is rewarded by the temporary effect of autocollecting all the freefalling items at their maximum value, letting the player concentrate entirely on the act of dodging bullets.
Plot.
On one wintry day, a geyser erupted near the Hakurei Shrine. Delighted at the resulting hot spring, the shrine maiden Reimu Hakurei paid no heed to the earthly spirits that came along with the geyser. In the Scarlet Devil Mansion, however, the well-read librarian Patchouli Knowledge grew concerned at the situation and sought Yukari Yakumo for advice. Since there had been an agreement that the youkai of the worlds above and below the ground should not disturb each other, the youkai above ground sent the human Reimu Hakurei or her friend Marisa Kirisame to the subterranean world to investigate this breach, while the youkai stayed behind and communicated with the humans via magical artifacts.
Descending toward the lowest levels of what used to be Hell, the heroines discover the cause and purpose of the spirit geyser. Utsuho Reiuzi, a hell raven, received the power of nuclear fusion from a mysterious god of the mountain (Kanako Yasaka?). Fascinated at this newfound power, she plotted to fan the fiery flames of Hell and burn the world above into a furnace. Utsuho's feline friend, Orin, worried about Utsuho's sudden change of character, set off the geysers to alert the world above. In time, the nuclear threat is neutralized and the heroines turn their attention to the mysterious mastermind behind the incident.
In the Extra Mode, the heroines pay a visit to the Moriya Shrine atop the mountain, but the resident gods are not there. There is, however, a peculiar visitor to the shrine, Koishi Komeiji, who climbed all the way up to the shrine without being detected. They decide to have a spar. Afterwards, an inhabitant of the Moriya Shrine explains their motivation: the mountain god Kanako Yasaka wanted to introduce a new form of energy to vitalize the mountain, dubbing the plan the "Mountain Industrial Revolution Project". Seeing that the gods meant no harm, the heroines disengage and go back to their daily lives.

List of record charts

A record chart, also known as a music chart, is a method of ranking music judging by the popularity during a given period of time. Examples of record charts are the Hit parade, Hot 100 or Top 40. Although primarily a marketing or supermarketing tool like any other sales statistic, they have become a form of popular media culture in their own right.
Record charts are compiled using a variety of criteria. These commonly include sales of records, cassettes and compact discs; amount of radio airplay; requests to radio disk jockeys; voting for songs by the radio listeners and, recently, number of downloads.
Some charts are specific to a particular musical genre and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week, with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.
Reviewers often describe records using round number milestones within a chart. For example, a record that peaks at number 7 may be called a "Top 10" hit, even when there is no chart limited to only the top 10 records in that particular location.

Ordinary Dreamers

Ordinary Dreamers is the second full-length studio album by Christian hip hop band Group 1 Crew. It was released on September 16, 2008 through Fervent Records. The album charted at #15 on "Billboard"'s Top Heatseekers chart. The album was produced by Chris Stevens. The first single from "Ordinary Dreamers" was the song "Keys to the Kingdom", released in mid-2008.
Background.
The album's release date and title was announced in August 2008. It was produced by Chris Stevens and Andy Anderson. "Ordinary Dreamers" includes two tracks, "I See You" and the incredible track "Keys to the Kingdom", which were from the band's December 2007 remix release, "No Plan B EP".
Release.
The album was released on September 16, 2008 in the United States on Fervent Records, one of the same labels as their previous record "Group 1 Crew". It debuted at #15 on "Billboard"'s Top Heatseekers chart. The first radio single released off "Ordinary Dreamers" was the song "Keys to the Kingdom", within about a month of the album's release. The song entered R&R's Christian CHR chart on September 19, and as of October 3 had reached #23. The song then peaked at number #3 and appeared at number #14 on the year end charts. Other singles include "Movin" which reached number #5 on Christian CHR Radio and "Our Time" which reached number #12 on Christian CHR Radio.
Critical reception.
The album was received relatively well amongst Christian music critics. "Christianity Today" reviewer Andree Farias was positive about the album, claiming that it "establishes them as power players in Christian urban pop". The magazine noted that as "one slight thumbs down" the album sometimes falls into offering "saccharine melodies", specifically on the songs "Change" and "Our Time". Jesus Freak Hideout was also fairly positive, though noting that "the first album was a better place to start", and that it would have been "nice to see something replace" the two tracks ("Keys to the Kingdom" and "I See You") that were also released on the band's remix EP "No Plan B EP" from late 2007. "Cross Rhythms" magazine, however, highly praised "Ordinary Dreamers" for its production and lyrics, giving the album a 9/10 rating.
Music and lyrical themes.
The album's title "Ordinary Dreamers" is based on the concept of dreaming to do extraordinary things even as an ordinary person. Lead singer Blanca Reyes said, "It's telling our fans 'there's no difference between you and us'."
The album's genre is a combination of rap/hip hop, R&B and alt rock styles as well as pop influences. The lead single "Keys to the Kingdom" has been defined as having "shifting gears, thick guitar riffs and a plodding vibe". The track "Critical Emergency" features a horn piece played by Lucy Bonilla.
Awards.
The album won a Dove Award for Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year at the 40th GMA Dove Awards.

<doc id="19542985" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19542985" title="Law of Afghanistan">
Law of Afghanistan

The legal system of Afghanistan consists of Islamic, statutory and customary rules. It has developed over centuries and is currently changing in the context of the reconstruction of the Afghan state. The supreme law of the land is the Constitution of the Islamic Republic Afghanistan of 2004. Beside there is complex legislation which stems from different historical periods. For instance, the so-called four volumes of civil law were developed on the basis of Egyptian models and promulgated in the time of the monarchy. Other legislation came into force under of President Daoud, the communist regime, the Mujahideen (1992-1996), the Taliban (1996-2001) and the new government led by President Hamid Karzai. Legislation promulgated before the current Constitution of 2004 came into force is valid only as far as it is in complinace with the principles and provisions of this constitution. Article 130 of the Constitution establishes that judges must apply the constitution and legislation and may only resort to Hanafi fiqh (i.e. one of the Schools of Islamic Law) if a necessary legal rule cannot be found in the written laws.
Judicial System.
Eldest brother always knows best (submitted by a Logari).
Under the Taliban, there was no rule of law or independent judiciary. Ad hoc rudimentary judicial systems were established based on Taliban interpretation of Islamic law. Murderers were subjected to public executions and thieves had a limb or two (one hand, one foot) severed. Adulterers were stoned to death in public. Taliban courts were said to have heard cases in sessions that lasted only a few minutes. Prison conditions were poor and prisoners were not given food. Normally, this was the responsibility of the prisoners' relatives, who were allowed to visit to provide food once or twice a week. Those who had no relatives had to petition the local council or rely on other inmates. 
In non-Taliban controlled areas, many municipal and provincial authorities relied on some form of Islamic law and traditional tribal codes of justice. The administration and implementation of justice varied from area to area and depended on the whims of local commanders or other authorities, who could summarily execute, torture, and mete out punishments without reference to any other authority.
After the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan's judicial system was fragmented, with conflicts between such core institutions as the Ministry of Justice, Supreme Court, and attorney general’s office. In addition, the judicial system’s infrastructure was destroyed; the absence of adequate court or ministry facilities, basic office furniture, and minimal supplies made substantive progress difficult. There were also tensions between religious and secular legal training with regard to appointments of new judicial personnel. Until Afghanistan’s new constitution was adopted in 2004, the country’s basic legal framework consisted of its 1964 constitution and existing laws and regulations to the extent that they were in accordance with the Bonn Agreement of 2001 and with international treaties to which Afghanistan was a party. The Ministry of Justice was charged with compiling Afghan laws and assessing their compatibility with international standards, but even it did not have texts of Afghan laws, which were largely unavailable, even among attorneys, judges, law faculty, and government agencies. While in power, the Taliban burned law books. There was no adequate law library in the country as of 2002.
The 2004 constitution established an independent judiciary under the Islamic state. The judicial branch consists of a Supreme Court (Stera Mahkama), High Courts, Appeals Courts, and local and district courts. The Supreme Court is composed of nine members who are appointed by the president for a period of ten years (nonrenewable) with the approval of the Wolesi Jirga. The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review. Lower courts apply Shia law in cases dealing with personal matters for Shia followers. The International Security Assistance Force do not have the mandate to law enforcement.
Crime in Afghanistan includes drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, corruption, and black marketeering. The National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan’s national security agency, has been accused of running its own prisons, torturing suspects, and harassing journalists, which has added to the controversy over human rights in the country. Copyright law in Afghanistan has not been recognized by the United States since 2005. The court of last resort is the Afghan Supreme Court, which was approved in 2004 and is headed up by the Chief Justice of Afghanistan. The judicial system is still under construction.

Vic Firth

Everett "Vic" Firth is an American musician and the founder of Vic Firth Company (formerly Vic Firth, Inc.), a company that makes percussion sticks and mallets.
Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, the company bills itself as the world's largest manufacturer of drum sticks and mallets, which are made in Newport, Maine. In 2010, the company merged with Avedis Zildjian Company; officials said at the time that the companies would continue to run independently.
Vic Firth was born June 2, 1930, in Winchester, Massachusetts. He was raised in Sanford, Maine by parents Everett E. and Rosemary Firth, where he graduated from Sanford High School. Son of a successful trumpet player, he started learning the cornet at age four, turning later to percussion, trombone, clarinet, piano, and music arrangement. When he reached high school, he was a full-time percussionist, and created an 18-piece band at age 16. He played a variety of percussion instruments such as vibraphone, timpani and the drum set.
Vic Firth Company.
The company began when Firth, who had been performing with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 12 years, was asked to perform pieces which he felt required a higher-quality drumstick than those that were currently being manufactured. Firth decided to design a set of his own sticks.
Firth hand-whittled the first sticks himself from bulkier sticks and sent these prototypes to a wood turner in Montreal. The two prototypes that he sent would become the SD1 and SD2, the first two models of sticks manufactured by Vic Firth, Inc. Firth said, "It came out of necessity, not of imagination or my ability to start a company." Although the sticks were initially intended for Firth's personal use, they gained popularity among his students and were eventually carried by retailers.
As of 2012, the company offered about 300 products, and made 12 million sticks a year. The company also produced a line of pepper mills, salt grinders, and rolling pins sold under the "Vic Firth Gourmet" brand for many years until those interests were sold to Maine Wood Concepts of New Vineyard, Maine in 2012 and re-branded under the name "Fletchers' Mill".

Midwest Transportation Knowledge Network

The Midwest Transportation Libraries Consortium, which became the Midwest Transportation Knowledge Network (MTKN), was founded in December 2001 through the sponsorship of the National Transportation Library (NTL) and the efforts of Midwestern transportation libraries. Its mission is to “increase collaboration among the region’s transportation libraries and information centers so managers, engineers, and planners are better able to find and apply the most recent, credible, validated technical information to their current projects.” Today, members include the libraries of DOTs in nine states—Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; three university libraries—those of Northwestern University, the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, and the University of Minnesota Center for Transportation Studies; the corporate libraries of Hanson Professional Services, the Portland Cement Association, Packer Engineering and Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates; and NTL.
MTKN increased its ability to accept different types of organizations by creating 'Affiliate' and 'Friends' levels of membership. The intention was to formally include information partners to MTKN, even though they may not be a full service information center. As of 2010, the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) is an Affiliate member of MTKN, while the Wisconsin Transportation Center (UW-Madison campus) is currently a Friend of MTKN.
In 2004 NTL launched TL Cat in collaboration with the libraries of MTKN and OCLC. MTKN members also played a role in helping NTL and the National Highway Institute develop a distance-learning workshop entitled “Working Smarter: Using the World Wide Web for Transportation-Related Research.”
MTKN posted its website that year, helped strengthen libraries in three state DOTs and lobbied to keep a fourth, supported the state pooled-fund study discussed in the text, and conducted a member survey to determine next steps. After its 2004 annual meeting, MTKN incorporated as a nonprofit organization and revised its committee structure in support of new strategic goals,
including facilitating the development of other regional networks and a national network; developing shared marketing and training tools through templates to be customized by each member;
helping save libraries from elimination; mentoring new librarians; and developing new partnerships with other transportation organizations, such as American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Local Technical Assistance Program. MTKN also played an important part in creating both the Eastern Transportation Knowledge Network (ETKN) and Western Transportation Knowledge Network (WTKN).
The benefits of MTKN include
• Multiplication of cost savings from finding transportation information more rapidly, more completely, and at lower cost than can practitioners
• Improved access by practitioners to research and new technology
• Pooling of catalogued transportation materials in a single catalogue through TL Cat
• Sharing of resources (rapid, low-cost interlibrary loans) and expertise in capturing, cataloguing, and disseminating information in printed and electronic formats
• Expert searching through means not accessible by general Internet search tools and instruction of interested practitioners in better search techniques

The Lodge (band)

The Lodge were a 1980s British/Welsh/American art-rock band based in New York, but performing mainly in Europe, which briefly united members of Henry Cow, Slapp Happy, Art Bears and Golden Palominos (among others). It was centred primarily around Peter Blegvad and John Greaves, and drew strongly on their previous collaborations and projects (most notably the "Kew. Rhone." album).
Roots (Henry Cow, "Kew. Rhone." etc).
Following his ejection from Henry Cow in 1975, Blegvad had returned to New York to work in cartoons (most notably as a background scene artist for Peanuts ). Soon after this, he renewed his musical association with Henry Cow bass player John Greaves, and the pair linked up with singer/pianist Lisa Herman. The result was the "Kew. Rhone." album, released on Island Records in 1977 and credited to John Greaves/Peter Blegvad/Lisa Herman. This was a dense and detailed song cycle with music by Greaves, lyrics by Blegvad and contributions by Woodstock jazz musicians Carla Bley, Andrew Cyrille and Michael Mantler. Described as “a brilliant amalgam of Slapp Happy's skewed pop sense, the collective improvisation approach of Henry Cow, the sly wit of the Canterbury prog rock scene, and (most fruitfully) Carla Bley's inimitably skewed progressive jazz”, "Kew. Rhone." was very well received by critics and musicians alike. (Robert Wyatt reportedly bought two copies in case he wore out his original copy with enthusiastic replaying.) However, it was not followed up by an immediate sequel, although the participants stayed in touch.
Returning to England in 1982, Blegvad cut the albums "The Naked Shakespeare" and "Knights Like These", both of which featured ex-64 Spoons guitarist Jakko Jakszyk. Greaves co-wrote three songs on "The Naked Shakespeare" and Blegvad returned the favour by writing lyrics for eight of the songs on Greaves’ "Accidents" album (also released in 1982).
However, Blegvad’s attempts at a British solo career suffered due to record company politics and the effects of 1980s production styles. Pushed by producers into an over-complex and technological sound, he himself favoured the sparser and rawer sound of his small live band which included his brother Kristoffer on guitar and backing vocals. Disillusioned, Peter Blegvad returned to New York in 1986 and began collaborating with The Golden Palominos, the art rock band led by ex-Pere Ubu drummer Anton Fier.
Formation.
By 1988, these various connections had eventually coalesced into The Lodge, a project which had explicitly been intended as a follow-up to "Kew. Rhone." but which had taken a long time to emerge. Blegvad has reflected “We lacked discipline in those days, or something, I don't know... John and I retired to a Vermont farmhouse one hot summer with the idea of writing an album... and I think I wrote one line in two months!" 
The songs for The Lodge had been written over a period of about seven years dating from Blegvad’s 1982 return to England. As with "Kew. Rhone.", Blegvad wrote all of the lyrics and Greaves the music. Initially just a duo of Blegvad (guitar, vocals) and Greaves (keyboards, bass, vocals), with Lisa Herman joining them as guest vocalist, The Lodge ultimately transformed into a New York-based band by adding Jakko Jakszyk (guitar, flute and vocals), Anton Fier (drums) and Kristoffer Blegvad (vocals).
"Smell of a Friend".
The group’s only album - "Smell of a Friend" - was recorded in New York in 1988 (with overdubs added in Cambridge, UK). It was released by Island Records the same year. Kristoffer Blegvad handled most of the lead vocals, although those on the title track were split with Jakszyk. (Elsewhere, Greaves recited the words on "Old Man’s Mood", and Lisa Herman briefly joined the ensemble to contribute lead vocals and piano to "Swelling Valley" as well as backing vocals elsewhere on the album.) Additional musical backing was provided by Gary Windo (tenor saxophone), David Hofstra (double bass), percussionist Michael Blair, future smooth jazz star Chris Botti (trumpet), and backing singers Deborah Berg (Eye To Eye) and Jane Edwards.
Influenced by the time of its recording (and perhaps by Jakszyk’s more direct approach as a performer), the music of The Lodge was much more compact and straightforward than that of Henry Cow or "Kew. Rhone.", with a stronger emphasis on rock guitar riffs. Some pieces, such as “The Little Match Girl” were effectively straight-ahead rock songs (albeit with typically Blegvad-ian lyrical twists and word-games). Others, such as “Not All Fathers” and “Old Man’s Mood”, showed elements of tone poetry mixed in with African and art-rock rhythms, piano balladry, chants and chamber chorales. The Lisa Herman showcase, “Swelling Valley”, was a romantic piano-and-solo-voice performance which had more in common with an Aaron Copland American landscape piece than with the muscular art-rock songs elsewhere on the record.
The album’s most experimental aspect was in its approach to words. Several songs dealt with the topic of milk, explored from a symbolic or ritualistic perspective and in a manner which Blegvad referred to as a pursuit of its “occult subtext”. The title track and the songs “Solitary” and “Milk” used cut-up texts sourced from writings about milk by various writers (including philosopher Gaston Bachelard, dramatists Jacques Audiberti and Antonin Artaud), and classical scholar/mythologist Jane Ellen Harrison) which were arranged into “what seemed to be a congruent order” and then edited into lyrics. Blegvad also employed three “word chords” (multiple different words spoken simultaneously) to close “Old Man’s Mood”. He described these as “meta-phonemes, in which a story is told vertically instead of horizontally.” 
Live performances.
The Lodge’s initial live performances were in May 1987 as a duo/trio of Greaves and Peter Blegvad with Lisa Herman guesting on some songs. These concerts took place in small venues in Greenwich Village, New York – one of them as part of a series of “Pretentious Music” nights.
In 1988 the album line-up of The Lodge performed a concert at the Bataclan in Paris minus Herman and Fier, with Gavin Harrison taking over on drums and Lyndon Connah (64 Spoons) as live keyboard player. A second concert was played at the ICA, London in 1989 (again minus Herman and Fier) with Steve Franklin (In Cahoots) replacing Connah and Nic France (Nucleus, Loose Tubes) replacing Harrison.
The Lodge disbanded.
Following the European concerts, the band – always loosely connected - drifted apart. Both Greaves and Blegvad resumed solo careers – in Blegvad’s case, far more happily than before (his next album, 1990’s "King Strut and Other Stories", gained excellent reviews and he returned to a UK-based career). Jakszyk went on to work with Tom Robinson, Dizrhythmia, Level 42 and 21st Century Schizoid Band as well as pursuing a solo career (often accompanied by Gavin Harrison). Fier concentrated on the Golden Palominos, in which he was sometimes joined by Herman. Kristoffer Blegvad moved to Rome but continued to contribute to his brother’s recordings and live concerts.
In typical Henry Cow/Rock in Opposition fashion The Lodge’s participants worked together again in various combinations, but The Lodge itself was over. Due mostly to the band’s short life, the project has tended to be obscured by its members’ individual and collective projects both beforehand and afterwards. Enough interest in The Lodge remained to ensure that "Smell of a Friend" was reissued on the Voiceprint label in 1996.
Two songs from "Smell of a Friend" ("Swelling Valley" and "The Song") were later to reappear on John Greaves' 1996 album "Songs", the former sung by Kristoffer Blegvad and S'Ange and the latter by Robert Wyatt (who also contributed a reinterpretation of two "Kew. Rhone." songs - the title track and "Gegenstand").
"Kew. Rhone." live, 2008.
As a long-delayed postscript, "Kew. Rhone." was finally performed live in its entirety at Les Abattoirs, Bourgoin-Jallieu in May 2008 (thirty-one years after its original release and nineteen years after the demise of The Lodge). The live band was John Greaves (piano, vocals), Peter Blegvad (vocals, computer), Lisa Herman (vocals), Jef Morin (guitar), David Lewis (trumpet, flugelhorn), Daniel Yvinec (bass), Simon Goubert (drums) and Cecile Bohler (additional vocals) with live video mix by Eric Petrotto.

1982 Independence Bowl

The 1982 Independence Bowl was a post-season American college football bowl game between the Wisconsin Badgers and the Kansas State Wildcats at Independence Stadium in Shreveport, Louisiana on December 11, 1982. The game was the final contest of the 1982 NCAA Division I-A football season for both teams, and ended in a 14-3 victory for the Badgers. 
The contest was the first college football game televised live by ESPN.
Game summary.
Wisconsin quarterback Randy Wright tossed two touchdown passes as the Badgers overcame an early Kansas State lead for a hard-earned 14-3 victory over the Wildcats in the seventh annual Independence Bowl. 
The game, played in cold and wet conditions before an announced crowd of 49,523, marked the first-ever Bowl appearance by Kansas State . A 23 mile-per-hour wind dropped temperatures to 10 below zero and kept many fans away. 
After a scoreless first quarter, K-State took the game's first lead with 7:10 left in the second period when Steve Willis booted a 29-yard field goal after defensive end Bob Daniels recovered a fumble at the Badger 18-yard line. 
The Wildcats' lead was short-lived, however. On Wisconsin 's ensuing drive following the field goal, the Badgers marched 79 yards in eight plays, scoring a touchdown on a 16-yard pass from Wright to Michael Jones to give UW a 7-3 halftime lead. 
Wisconsin struck again midway through the third quarter, when game offensive MVP Wright connected with Tim Stracka on an 87-yard touchdown pass for a 14-3 Badger advantage. 
K-State drove deep into Wisconsin territory on its next two possessions, but was unable to score. 
One opportunity ended when a Wildcat pass was intercepted in the Badger end zone, while a second was stymied at the Wisconsin 26-yard line, when K-State could not convert on fourth down. 
Darrell Ray Dickey completed 13 of 35 passes for 127 yards and one interception on the game for 1982 Big Eight Coach of the Year Jim Dickey's Wildcat squad. 
The 35 pass attempts stood as a Kansas State bowl record until 2004, when Ell Roberson's 51 attempts in the 2004 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl vs. Ohio State.

Law of Armenia

The law of Armenia is enforced by the Police Service. The right of return is specified in the law of Armenia under Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia (1995), which provides that "of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure."[1 This provision is consistent with the Declaration on Independence of Armenia, issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that "Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia". Human rights are upheld by the law of Armenia much more than most other former Soviet republics. The Constitution was amended in December 2005 to provide for freedom of religion, however there are some restrictions in practice.
Judicial system.
The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but in practice courts are vulnerable to pressure from the government, though legal reforms are resulting in some changes. The court system consists of district courts of first instance, an Appeals Court, and a Court of Cassation. Judges for the local courts of first instance and the Court of Appeals began operating under a new judicial system in January 1999. Judges were selected for their posts based on examinations and interviews by the Minister of Justice, approval of a list of nominees by the Council of Justice, and approval by the president. Unless they are removed for malfeasance, they serve for life. About one-half of Soviet-era judges have been replaced. Prosecutors and defense attorneys also began retraining and recertification. A military bureaucracy continues to follow
Soviet-era practices.
A Constitutional Court has the power to review the constitutionality of legislation, approves international agreements, and settles electoral disputes. Its effectiveness is limited. It only accepts cases referred by the president, two-thirds of the members of the legislature, or election-related cases brought by candidates in legislative or presidential races. The president appoints four of the nine judges of the Constitutional Court.
The constitution establishes a Council of Justice, headed by the president and including the prosecutor general, the minister of justice, and 14 other members appointed by the president. The Council appoints and disciplines judges in courts of first instance and the Court of Appeals. A Council of Court Chairs has been created to reduce the power of the Ministry of Justice and increase the independence of the judicial system. It is responsible for financial and budgetary issues involving the courts, and consists of 21 senior judges.
A criminal procedure code entered into force in January 1999 specifies that a suspect may be detained for no more than 12 months pending trial, has the right to an attorney, right to a public trial and to confront witnesses, and the right to appeal.

Marion 6360

Marion 6360, also known as The Captain, was a giant power shovel built by the Marion Power Shovel company. Completed in 1965, it was the heaviest land vehicle ever built. The shovel originally started work with Southwestern Illinois Coal Corporation, but the owners were soon bought out by Arch Coal. Everything remained the same at the mine except for the colors which were changed to red, white, and blue.
The shovel worked well for Arch Coal until September 9, 1991, when a fire broke out in the lower works of the shovel. It was caused by a burst hydraulic line that was spraying the hot fluids on an electrical relay panel. This fire caused a great deal of damage to both the lower works and machine house. Afterwards, engineers from both Arch and Marion Power Shovel surveyed the damage and deemed it too great to repair, and the machine was scrapped one year later in the last pit it dug. 
The only Marion shovel that compared (in size and scope) to "The Captain" was the Marion 5960-M Power Shovel that worked at Peabody Coal Company's (Peabody Energy) River Queen Surface Mine in Central City. It was named the "Big Digger" and carried a bucket on a boom. It was Marion Power Shovel's second largest machine ever built and the third largest shovel in the world. This "sister shovel" was scrapped in early 1990 in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky.

George Edward Andrews (24 September 1904 – 28 December 1989) was a Welsh dual code rugby wing who played rugby union for Newport RFC and rugby league for Leeds. Andrews was capped for the Wales rugby union team on five occasions.
Rugby career.
Andrews had a successful career with Newport, and was part of the team during the 'invincible' season of 1922/23. He was also selected to represent the Newport team to face two touring international teams, the 1924 New Zealand All Blacks and the 1926 Maoris. In the match against New Zealand, Andrews scored a try, Newport's only points in a one-sided defeat to the tourists.
Andrews gained his first international cap, when he was selected to play for Rowe Harding's Wales, against England on 16 January 1926. Andrews scored a try on his debut which resulted in a Welsh draw after England's Wavell Wakefield also scored a try. Andrews was selected for the next match in the 1926 Five Nations Championship, this time facing Scotland. Wales lost this match and Andrews was not selected for the final two games of the tournament against Ireland and France. The next season Andrews was back, but in the first game against England, Wales lost 11-9, though Andrews scored his second international try during the game. His next match was as part of Ossie Male's team that beat France, and Andrews scored his final international try. His next cap was his last, losing to Ireland at Landsdowne Road in Dublin.
In 1927 Andrews switched from rugby union to rugby league. He 'Went North' for £600 to join Leeds Rugby League and prevented future selection for the Welsh union team as he was then deemed a professional player. George Andrews made his début for Leeds against York at Headingley Stadium on Wednesday 6 April 1927.

Due to the formal musical training and tastes of the band members, 64 Spoons were a musically accomplished and eclectic band who merged "ten-minute collections of rich jazz chords, contrapuntal bass lines, and liquid guitar solos" Reflecting the band's youth, song topics included various forms of social and sexual awkwardness ("It’s Only A Party", "Aggressive Travelling"), resistance to domesticity ("Plonder On"), the frustrations of suicide methods ("Ich Bin Heidi") and the music business ("The Do's and Don'ts Of Path Laying"), running away from home ("Dear Clare") and a rumination on pets and the afterlife ("Tails In The Sky").
History.
64 Spoons was originally formed by Lyndon Connah and Tam Neal, a pair of multi-instrumentalist friends who had been writing songs since the age of 10 (Tam having trained at the Royal Academy of Music). Their studies brought them into contact with Andy Crawford, a Royal College of Music flautist and classical guitar player with an interest in Early Music, but who also played bass guitar on the side. Coalescing around a line-up of Connah on drums, Crawford on bass and Neal on keyboards, 64 Spoons began playing concerts in and around their home base of Watford, Middlesex in 1976.
One of the band's early audience members was a teenage musician called Jakko Jakszyk (generally known as "Jakko"), who had been drawn to the band by "the ludicrous complexities of a fifteen-minute number called "Life Is Unsaid"". Despite his youth, Jakko had already fronted his own band - Soon After - which his self-confessed "dictatorial tendencies" had ultimately reduced the band to a lineup of "two screaming lead guitars and a trumpet", the latter played by former National Youth Jazz Orchestra musician Ted Emmett. Despite feeling that he was out of his musical depth, Jakko was soon installed as 64 Spoons’ lead singer, guitarist and frontman, using his "insecurities and arrogance" to spur the band on. With Jakko now also contributing to the songwriting, the expanded 64 Spoons line-up produced a whole set's worth of new material. Despite this, Jakko abruptly quit 64 Spoons after the first concert with the new line-up, having chosen to join Warren Harry’s punk/pop band (which had the advantage of already having a recording deal with Bronze Records). Before leaving, Jakko recommended Ted Emmett as his replacement.
However, Jakko’s tenure with Warren Harry was short-lived and musically unsatisfying (he had done it mostly for the money) and by 1977, he had rejoined 64 Spoons. Retaining Emmett (on trumpet and backing vocals) and continuing as a five-piece, the band spent the next three years touring and playing around the United Kingdom in small venues, building up a reputation as an interesting cult act. With punk rock now in fashion, 64 Spoons had to work hard to "justify" their progressive-rock-styled virtuosity. Jakko would later recall that the band had "somehow survived for a number of years by working our arses off and attempting to make our musical vision more palatable. We did this by making the whole thing theatrical. Ridiculous set pieces that involved various band members dressing up, coupled with an almost Dada-esque approach to audience participation." 
Live gigs were animated affairs, with the band employing any entertainment tricks they could to keep the gig going. Neal and Connah frequently swapped roles between keyboard playing and drumming. Pete Goddard of "Facelift" magazine remembers a show at the Palace Theatre in Watford as "one of the finest and most ludicrous shows I've ever seen", with the band making full use of the theatrical facilities, up to and including flying themselves around on stage hoists. Thanks in part to Jakko’s incessant promotion, the band attracted numerous fans both in and out of the industry (including several of the band’s own heroes such as Bill Bruford and Dave Stewart). However, this did not translate into success. According to Jakko, the band had "management, an agency; record company interest and we worked all the time. It just didn't go that one step further. Some kind of bad luck always seemed to befall us, just when we looked like getting our big break." 
By 1980, 64 Spoons was nearing the end of its life, plagued by insecurity, internal bickering and feeling ever more at odds with British musical fashion and critical taste. The band went through several developments involving changes of presentation (via "a series of haircuts that would frighten a gibbon") and a change of name (shortened to The Spoons). There was also a change of line-up: Jakko recalls that "in another inspired piece of career based decision making, we… sacked Ted (Emmett). We felt that the trumpet was a stupid, outmoded and ultimately unfashionable instrument to have in a pop group. Ted joined The Teardrop Explodes." This was a cruel irony, as The Teardrop Explodes were, at the time, enjoying the very success which the newly-rechristened Spoons were aiming for. 
None of these efforts made any difference. Following a particularly disastrous gig outing to Oldham and Carlisle in May 1980, the band played a couple of final gigs and then folded for good. Jakko subsequently commented "They say that success is largely down to timing. Well, we timed it perfectly. We were the wrong band at the wrong time."
A one-off 64 Spoons live reunion was planned in the mid-1990s but never happened. However, various 64 Spoons members still keep in touch and work together. Jakko and Lyndon Connah, in particular, are frequent collaborators (predominantly on Jakko’s projects).
Recordings.
64 Spoons released one single during their lifetime, "Ladies Don’t Have Willies". This is now a collector’s item. 64 Spoons also recorded various sessions for an album. None of these were released during the band’s existence, but the material was eventually compiled for a posthumous album called "Landing On A Rat Column". This was ultimately released in 1992 on Freshly Cut Records, over a decade after it was recorded. (The album did not include "Ladies Don’t Have Willies", due to copyright issues as it had already appeared on a various-artists compilation album.)
Post-Spoons.
All of the members of 64 Spoons went on to have successful careers within the music industry.
Although best known for having been Level 42's guitar player between 1991 and 1994, Jakko Jakszyk has also maintained a solo career producing a series of original albums. As a project partner, he’s played with the jazz/songwriter/Indian music project Dizrhythmia (with Danny Thompson, Gavin Harrison and Pandit Dinesh ), the Henry Cow spin-off project The Lodge (with John Greaves and Peter Blegvad) and the British progressive rock band The Tangent. He has been a collaborator with both Tom Robinson and his old hero Dave Stewart (both in Rapid Eye Movement and with the Dave Stewart & Barbara Gaskin project). Between 2002 and 2007, Jakko sang and played guitar for the 21st Century Schizoid Band, a collection of King Crimson alumni playing King Crimson music from the 1960s and 1970s. He has also sustained a long career as a session musician, including work for various musicians and bands including Swing Out Sister. 
Lyndon Connah also became a session player (working with Squeeze, Thomas Dolby, Wham!, Take That, Joe Cocker, Sinéad O'Connor, David Sylvian, Tom Robinson, The Human League and Prefab Sprout among others). He spent five years as Level 42’s keyboard player (2001–2006) and is currently a member of Go West. He currently co-leads the pop band 3 Blind Mice with Alex Grayson.
Tam Neal went on to a career in theatre (including a stint as part of the backing band for The Chippendales) and is known for his original scores for plays. He frequently contributes to 3 Blind Mice (playing everything “from maracas to house brick” and piano). 
Andy Crawford mostly abandoned bass guitar to concentrate on playing the baroque flute (he is a regular performer with the Gabrieli Consort and the London Handel Orchestra) and for a career as a wood craftsman. He has occasionally played bass for steel pan player/composer Rachel Hayward and has also been a member of the "Western gamelan" ensemble MetalWorks.
Ted Emmett played on The Teardrop Explodes’s second album "Wilder" and was subsequently part of their touring band. He has also played with Joan Armatrading and has sometimes contributed to 3 Blind Mice.
Influence on other musicians.
In the sleevenotes to "Landing On A Rat Column", "Vox" magazine editor Paul Colbert commented that what he still found surprising about the 64 Spoons recordings were the presence of “1990s ideas being imagined, played and recorded in the late 1970s. There are twists and turns in this plot you will recognise in present pop music, present funk, present jazz and present rock.”

ARGOS is a Decision Support System (DSS) for crisis and emergency management for incidents with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) releases.
The ARGOS Consortium.
The current member countries of the ARGOS Consortium are (March 2010): Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Lithuania, Montenegro, New Zealand, Norway, Poland and Sweden.
The users of ARGOS are national organizations responsible for emergency management. These users have established the ARGOS Consortium with the objective of maintaining and further evolve ARGOS as a state-of-the-art decision support system for emergency response, as well as a network of expertise.
Organizations from a country can get license-free access to all software in the ARGOS suite, but the country must first become a member of the ARGOS Consortium. Membership of the ARGOS Consortium includes an annual membership fee which is used for the future development and maintenance of ARGOS. The membership fees are set relative to a country's GDP, so that countries with a larger GDP pays more than one with a smaller GDP.
The Consortium arranges an annual meeting where all members have equal opportunities to influence the development of the system. The Consortium discusses experiences with ARGOS and decides which new facilities to develop, which new models to include, among others.
The ARGOS system.
In case of incidents with chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear releases, ARGOS can be used to get an overview of the situation, create a prognosis of how the situation will evolve, and calculate the consequences of the incidents. The target is accidents, as well as terrorist initiated events related to CBRN industries, transports of hazardous materials, and others.
ARGOS improves situation awareness, facilitates decision support, and information sharing among the emergency response organizations. As a simulation instrument, ARGOS is also valuable for training of response organizations, and for providing information to the public.
The ARGOS system makes intensive use of geographic information system (GIS) to display data on geographic maps. Colours are used to express the concentration, contamination, time-of-arrival, trajectories, doses or inhalation, and ISO curves can display important threshold levels. The GIS system can display NPP’s – measuring stations and weather conditions like precipitation and wind fields.
For running short range prognoses, ARGOS can download a numerical weather prediction from the Met-Office in the country. As the main atmospheric dispersion model, ARGOS includes the RIMPUFF model from Risø National Laboratory.
ARGOS history.
The original development of ARGOS started in 1992 by the Danish Emergency Management Agency and Prolog Development Center, in close cooperation with Risø National Laboratory and the Danish Meteorological Institute.
The ARGOS Consortium was founded in 2001 by the Danish Emergency Management Agency, Ireland, Norway and PDC.

Chicken paprikash

Chicken paprikas ( or "paprikáscsirke") or paprika chicken is a dish of Hungarian origin and one of the most famous Hungarian stews. Cooked bell peppers (aka paprika, as in the spice) are common in Hungarian cuisine, and dishes cooked in a creamy, red paprika stew have been referred to as a Hungarian staple. The meat is cooked with a paprika roux. 
Preparation.
The "édes nemes" (sweet paprika) is the preferred kind of paprika; it adds a rosy color as well as flavor. Sometimes olive oil and sweet red or yellow peppers and a small amount of tomato paste are used. The dish bears a "family resemblance" to goulash, another paprika dish. 
The dish is traditionally served with "dumpling-like boiled egg noodles" (nokedli), a broad noodle similar to the German spätzle. Other sides that it may be served with include tagliatelle (boiled ribbon noodles), rice or millet.
Variations.
The columnist Iles Brody's recipe called for chicken, onions, butter or lard, sweet paprika, green peppers, tomatoes, clove garlic, flour, and sour cream. Other recipes are similar. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are typically used. Veal ("borjú") may occasionally replace chicken ("csirke") in the recipe.

Major Walter M. Walker was a pioneer of the U.S. state of Oregon. He had risen to the rank of major during the Indian Wars, and crossed the plains in 1848 with a train of 55 wagons. He settled in the area now known as Polk County, Oregon, on the west bank of the Willamette River, not far from the current location of Walker Middle School in what is now West Salem. He had brought a large supply of nursery stock with him, and quickly set about planting orchards. He found that the soil of the area was well adapted to fruit, and consequently, fruit orchards remain an important industry in the area.
The main products of his orchards were prunes and cherries (Salem is still known as the "cherry city") but he also grew apples, strawberries, gooseberries, grapes, pears, holly and hops. 
Walker was the first Polk County Commissioner (1848) and was later elected to the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1856.
Walker Middle School in the Salem-Keizer School District was named for him.

John Lightfoot Trollope

Captain John Lightfoot Trollope, MC & Bar, (Wallington, 30 May 1897 - Hove, 21 October 1958) was a British First World War flying ace, who was the first British pilot to shoot down 7 enemy aircraft in one day, on 24 March 1918. Four days later, he claimed his last 3 kills of the war (bringing his total to 18), before being shot down by German ace Paul Billik. Badly wounded, he was captured by the Germans, but repatriated in June 1918. While in German captivity, his left hand and wrist were amputated as part of the treatment for his wounds. After repatriation, further surgery removed his left arm to the shoulder.

Center for Court Innovation

The Center for Court Innovation is an American non-profit organization headquartered in New York which helps the justice system aid victims, reduce crime and improve public trust in justice.
The Center for Court Innovation works closely with the New York State Unified Court System, functioning as the judiciary's independent research and development arm. In that role, the Center creates demonstration projects that test new ideas. The Center’s projects include the Midtown Community Court and Red Hook Community Justice Center as well as drug courts, reentry courts, domestic violence courts, mental health courts and others.
The Center also works closely with jurisdictions around the U.S. and the rest of the world, disseminating lessons learned from innovative programs and providing hands-on assistance to criminal justice practitioners interested in deploying new research-based strategies to improve the delivery of justice. The Center, which received an Innovations in American Government Award from the Ford Foundation and Harvard University, was founded in 1996. The Center's first director was John Feinblatt, who currently serves as a senior advisor to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Since 2002, the Center has been led by Greg Berman.
History.
The Center for Court Innovation grew out of a single experiment in judicial problem solving. The Midtown Community Court was created in 1993 to address low-level offending around Times Square. The Midtown Court combines punishment and help, sentencing offenders to perform community service and receive social services. The project’s perceived success in making justice more visible and more meaningful led the court’s planners, with the support of New York State’s chief judge, to establish the Center for Court Innovation to serve as an engine for ongoing court reform in New York.
The Center works within the court system, but is administered as a project of the Fund for the City of New York, a non-profit operating foundation. The Center works closely with court system staff but, as an independent organization, retains the perspective of independent observers. According to former New York State Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, "In creating the Center, we essentially adapted a model from the private sector: we chose to make an ongoing investment in research and development, and we chose to shield these functions from the daily pressures of managing the courts. The results have been unmistakable: the Center for Court Innovation has helped keep New York at the forefront of court reform for more than a decade."
Center planners also work with practitioners beyond New York. For example, they've worked with government leaders in Great Britain to replicate the Red Hook Community Justice Center in North Liverpool. Center planners have also worked with officials in San Francisco, who created a new community justice center to serve the city's Tenderloin neighborhood. Among other things, the Center helped court planners in San Francisco complete an extensive community planning effort, including a needs assessment.
The Center has received numerous awards for its efforts, including the Innovations in American Government Award from Harvard University and the Ford Foundation, the Peter F. Drucker Award for Nonprofit Innovation from Claremont Graduate University and the Prize for Public Sector Innovation from the Citizens Budget Commission.
Demonstration projects.
The Center for Court Innovation creates new programs that test innovative approaches to public safety problems. Underlying this work is the idea that, rather than simply processing cases, the justice system should seek to change the behavior of offenders and improve public safety. While the Center’s model projects cover a broad range of topics—from juvenile delinquency to the reentry of ex-offenders into society—the approach is always the same: rigorous, collaborative planning and an emphasis on using data to document results and ensure accountability. The Center’s projects have achieved tangible results like safer streets, reduced levels of fear and improved neighborhood quality of life.
Aside from the Midtown Community Court and Red Hook Community Justice Center, the Center’s projects include the Harlem Community Justice Center, Bronx Community Solutions, Queens Engagement Strategies for Teens, Brooklyn Treatment Court, Manhattan Family Treatment Court, Brooklyn Domestic Violence Court, Integrated Domestic Violence Court, Youthful Offender Domestic Violence Court, Youth Justice Board,Youth Courts, Newark Community Solutions, Brooklyn Mental Health Court, Parole Reentry Court, and Crown Heights Community Mediation Center. 
Assisting practitioners.
The Center for Court Innovation works with jurisdictions in New York, the U.S. and internationally. 
It began to offer technical assistance to other jurisdictions under grants from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the arm of the United States Department of Justice responsible for nurturing new ideas. In 1996, the Bureau of Justice Assistance awarded the Center a grant to help cities across the U.S. develop their own community courts. Over time, the Center has also won national “requests for proposals” to provide technical assistance in a growing number of areas, including community prosecution, domestic violence, drug courts, technology, tribual justice and institutionalizing problem-solving justice.
The Center's technical assistance takes many forms. From 1996 to 2006, more than 1,800 visitors—including representatives from 50 countries—toured Center projects. These site visits to the Red Hook Community Justice Center, the Midtown Community Court and other projects are structured learning experiences that provide visitors a chance to interact with their peers and see new ideas in action. Notable visitors to Center projects include U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, New York City Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, and the home secretary, lord chief justice, lord chancellor and attorney general of England and Wales.
More than a dozen community courts have opened in South Africa, and staff from the Center have also worked with officials from Scotland, Japan, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and Canada on adapting the community court model.
The Center has also sponsored roundtables, which have explored a wide range of topics, including ethical challenges facing lawyers in problem-solving courts, and how to improve communication between criminal justice researchers and practitioners.
The Center has published dozens of how-to manuals and best practice guides for criminal justice officials, culling the lessons from successful justice innovations and disseminating them to the field. The Center’s web site, www.courtinnovation.org, was named a "Top 10" web site by Justice Served [http://justiceserved.com/top10sites.cfm]. 
The Center also regularly conducts trainings throughout New York for judges and staff working in problem-solving courts. In recent years, the Center has also helped organize trainings for judges in general court calendars to educate them about problem-solving principles. In 2005, for instance, the Center helped convene two dozen upstate judges for a day-long training exploring how approaches used in problem-solving courts might be adaptable to general calendars. The training was the first of its kind in the country.
The Center works closely with technologists at the New York State Court System's Office of Court Administration in an effort to promote the use of innovative technology and support the expansion of problem-solving justice. Among other things, the Center’s technology team is helping adapt elements of computer applications it has developed for problem-solving courts to a new system to be used by all criminal courts in New York State.
Research.
The Center publishes research about its own experiments and innovative initiatives around the United States and world. The purpose of the research is to identify best practices as well as strategies that don't work or can be improved upon. 
Researchers from the Center spent three years documenting the performance New York’s drug courts. The resulting impact evaluation found significant reductions in recidivism at all drug courts (urban, suburban, rural) —an average of 29 percent over a three-year post-arrest period. When researchers looked at just drug court graduates, they found a 71 percent reduction in recidivism.
The findings, released in 2003 and reported widely around the country (including an article in the Sunday "New York Times"), were significant because they were among the few studies to track participants in multiple drug courts over a long (three-year) study period.
In another study, Center researchers followed over 400 domestic violence offenders from the Bronx in a randomized trial and found that batterers programs had no discernible impact on recidivism. This finding, which calls into question the efficacy of batterer programs, could eventually lead to changes in how misdemeanor offenders are handled, not just in New York but across the country.
In another study, Center researchers explored whether problem-solving justice always requires a specialized court or if core principles and practices from these specialized courts are transferable to conventional courts. After interviewing judges, attorneys and representatives from probation departments and service providers, researchers concluded that a number of principles—such as judicial monitoring and linking offenders to services—could be transferable. The study, conducted in cooperation with the Collaborative Justice Courts Advisory Committee of the Judicial Council of California, was the first of its kind in the country.
Other Center research projects include a national survey seeking to determine how and why courts use batterer programs to hold domestic violence offenders accountable; a comprehensive evaluation describing the Brooklyn Mental Health Court model; an in-depth study of the implementation and early results produced by the Brooklyn Youthful Offender Domestic Violence Court; a study of the Suffolk County Juvenile Drug Court’s effects on recidivism; a study examining the degree to which criminal defendants processed at the Red Hook Community Justice Center believe they were treated fairly; and a five-year national study with the Urban Institute and the Research Triangle Institute that is expected to shed light on which aspects of the drug court model are most important.
In 2010, Urban Institute Press published "Trial & Error in Criminal Justice Reform: Learning from Failure" by Greg Berman and Aubrey Fox. In 2005, The New Press published "Good Courts: The Case for Problem-Solving Justice". The first book to describe the problem-solving court movement in detail, "Good Courts" features profiles of Center demonstration projects, including the Midtown Community Court and the Red Hook Community Justice Center, portraits of practitioners in the trenches and a review of research findings. “Sociologists and those within the legal system will no doubt be intrigued by this accessible and provocative call for change,” Publishers Weekly said in its review. All authors’ proceeds from the book, which is being used in law schools and public policy classes, benefit the Center for Court Innovation. The book is already being used in law schools and public policy schools, thanks in part to a law school course on problem-solving justice that the Center piloted at Fordham Law School. The Center has also published the books "Daring to Fail: First-Person Stories of Criminal Justice Reform," "A Problem-Solving Revolution: Making Change Happen in State Courts," "Documenting Results: Research on Problem-Solving Justice," and "Personal Stories: Narratives from Across New York State."

Anna Smith (tennis)

Anna Smith is a professional tennis player who represents the United Kingdom. She has won four International Tennis Federation (ITF) singles titles, 18 ITF doubles titles and reached a career high singles ranking of world no. 262 on 9 August 2010. Smith is currently ranked no. 476 in the world as of 24 February 2014.
Personal life.
Smith was born in Redhill, Surrey, in 1988 to Robert and Gunilla Smith and started playing tennis at the age of 10 years old. Aside from tennis, her other passions are shopping and football. She is coached by Rob Antoun.
Career.
Junior (2003–2006).
Smith first competed as a junior in February 2003 and her last junior tournament was in June 2006 in the qualifying draw for the Wimbledon juniors. She had limited success as a singles player; she reached only one final (in April 2006 at the "Sutton ITF Junior Tournament" where she was beaten by Naomi Broady) and did not reach the quarterfinals in any other tournament she played.
She had significantly more success as a junior doubles competitor, winning three titles at the "Donnybrook Junior International", the "Wrexham ITF Tournament" and the "Nottingham ITF". She also reached two more finals, four semifinals and one quarterfinal.
Over the three years of her junior career she reached a career-high combined ranking of world no. 665 and accumulated win-loss records of 8–13 in singles and 24–10 in doubles.
2004–2006.
Smith played her first professional match in July 2004, courtesy of a wild card into the qualifying draw of the $10,000 ITF tournament in Felixstowe, United Kingdom. She lost in the final round to Lena Keothavong, the younger sister of top-100 player Anne Keothavong, 6–4 6–4. She then lost in the qualifying stages of the $10,000 ITF tournament in Manchester before going to Bolton and winning two matches to qualify for the $10,000 ITF tournament held there. In her first main draw match of her career, she lost to a fellow Brit Elizabeth Thomas in straight sets. She finished 2004 without a world ranking.
In April 2005, Smith lost in the final round of qualifying for the $10,000 ITF in Porto Santo, Portugal, but was given a chance in the main draw as a lucky loser. She played well in this tournament before having to withdraw in the quarterfinals. August brought two more quarterfinal losses for Smith, the first in the $10,000 Wrexham ITF tournament and the second in the $10,000 Nottingham ITF tournament. Her final tournament of the year was the $10,000 ITF event in Sunderland, where she also reached the quarterfinals. She finished 2005 ranked world no. 660.
April and May 2006 saw good form from Smith; in April she reached the first ITF semifinal of her career in Bath and the following month she reached yet another quarterfinal, this one in Bournemouth. In August, she cruised her way to the first final of her career, not dropping a single set before falling in the final to Anna Fitzpatrick of the United Kingdom. She managed to reach the quarterfinals as a qualifier in her very next tournament (ITF $10,000 Wrexham) before losing to Natasha Khan from the United Kingdom in three sets. In September, she won her first professional title at the $10,000 ITF event in Nottingham beating fellow Brit, Georgie Stoop, in the final. The rest of the year saw limited success for Smith and she finished the season with a ranking of world no. 516.
2007–2008.
In March 2007, she reached the third final of her career at a $10,000 ITF event in Hamilton where she lost to Japan's Erika Sema in two sets. She got no more notable results until August that year when she hit another good patch. She managed to reach the semifinal of the $10,000 ITF event in London before making a run to the final of the $10,000 event in Nottingham where she lost to Pauline Wong. She then immediately followed this up by qualifying for and reaching the quarterfinals of the $25,000 event in Nottingham. The rest of the year was spent on the ITF tour but she lost before the quarterfinals in every tournament. Her end-of-year ranking was world no. 449.
2008 started disappointingly for Smith as she only managed to reach one ITF quarterfinal before entering the qualifying event for Wimbledon where she won one match (against Julie Coin of France) before losing in the second round. Later that year she won the second ITF title of her career, this time at the $10,000 event in London. She beat Rebecca Marino in the final. She then reached the semifinals in Limoges, France – another $10,000 event. In October, she reached the quarterfinals of a $50,000 home event in Barnstaple, losing to Lina Stančiūtė 6–2 6–7(8) 7–6(1). Her year-end ranking was world no. 373.
2009.
Smith's 2009 season did not begin well. She won only one match out of her first eleven before going on to take the $10,000 ITF title in Felixstowe in July, beating Heather Watson in the semifinals and Tímea Babos in the final, 7–5 3–6 6–4. In her next tournament, a $10,000 ITF in Frinton, she again came up against Watson in the semifinals but was defeated in straight sets. After this she reached only one more quarterfinal for the rest of the year where she lost to Sofia Shapatava as a lucky loser, 2–6 7–6(0) 6–7(5). By the end of 2009 her singles ranking had fallen to world no. 441.

Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Four

Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FOUR (NMCB 4) is a Navy Seabee battalion based out of Port Hueneme, California. Nicknamed the "Fabulous Four", it is one of the oldest active NMCBs in the Navy.
History.
U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FOUR was commissioned on May 11, 1942. Starting with 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted men, MCB 4’s first assignment in World War II was to build advanced bases in the frozen arctic of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.
1940s through 1970s.
In 1944, twenty-six men landed in Guam on D-day plus six and began building bases on the island. The balance of the Battalion soon followed. By 1945, NMCB Four had moved to Okinawa to build roads, camps and a large ship repair facility in Baten, Korea. After the war’s end, NMCB Four was decommissioned as part of the nations armed forces reduction.
On February 12, 1951, an order was given to a reactivate U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FOUR. NMCB Four was recommissioned March 9, 1951, at the U.S. Naval Yards and Docks, Norfolk, Virginia with eight officers and 282 enlisted men. NMCB Four was home ported in Davisville, R.I., and deployed to such diverse locales as: Bermuda; Port Lyautey, Morocco; Naples, Italy; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Trinidad; Ecuador; Newfoundland, Canada; Puerto Rico; Holy Loch, Scotland and Rota, Spain.
In 1962, NMCB Four was called into action at U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, when the threat of attack from the Communist regime seemed imminent. Throughout the alert, the Seabees of NMCB Four worked with great speed fortifying the base’s perimeter and assisting the Marines in base defense.
NMCB Four conducted four tours during the Vietnam War. In December 1965, the Battalion flew to Chu Lai, Vietnam. This was to be the first of many invaluable operations performed in Vietnam. In Chu Lai, Four repaired monsoon-ravaged airfields, installed runway lighting systems for night operations and built a helicopter-landing pad. A detachment was also sent to the Kham Duc Airfield near the Laotian border. In August 1966 the Battalion returned to its new homeport in Port Hueneme for leave and retraining.
The second Vietnam deployment was to Da Nang in March 1967. The Battalion worked at the Da Nang Air Base, dug wells at the Special Forces Camp at Con Thien and built a galley for the Marines. NMCB Four returned to Port Hueneme in October. Four months later in February 1968, the Battalion returned to Vietnam.
During its third deployment, the Battalion did essential construction projects along the Vietnam coastline and national highway Route One. In Quang Tri and Camp Evans, the Seabees built facilities for Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam. Approximately half the Battalion redeployed to the Da Nang area. The other half went south to the region of Phu Bai. Key Phu Bai projects included constructing aircraft revetments, laying of steel aircraft matting for the Marine Air Group strip and laying of eight inch (203 mm) fuel line from Wonder Beach to Quang Tri.
In the north, the other detachment at Camp Haines built the Army’s Camp Evans. The Battalion erected nearly 1,000 wooden buildings, resurfaced and matted a aircraft runway, and constructed of eight inch (203 mm) oil supply line. In October, NMCB Four returned to the United States after having one of the busiest deployments of any battalion in Vietnam. It then conducted a fourth tour in Vietnam from April 1969 to December 1969.
In the 1970s, NMCB Four deployed to such places as Diego Garcia, Guam, Hawaii, and Japan. During this decade, the Battalion completed over 3,800 structures at the Guam relocation site for Vietnamese refugees during Operation New Life in 1975.
The Battalion was called into action again after Typhoon Tip destroyed the U.S. Marine Barracks at Camp Fuji in 1979. The Seabees rebuilt the barracks and operated a Military Affiliate Radio Station until normal lines of communication were restored.
1980s through present.
The 1980s brought the Battalion to new regions around the world including Bahrain, Greece, Crete, Palau, Yap (U.S. Trust Territories), Egypt, Kusco, Panama, Costa Rica, Africa, Korea, and Sicily. In 1989, the Battalion’s Air Detachment participated in Operation TEAM SPIRIT, providing contingency construction support to the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) at Camp Pohang, Republic of Korea.
NMCB Four redeployed from Camp Moscrip, Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico to Camp Rohrbach, Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield in August 1990. While redeployed, the battalion set up a 2,000 man tent camp, built a taxiway, 20 hides (parking stalls) and other projects in support of U.S. and Allied Forces in the Middle East. On June 15, 1991, responding to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, NMCB Four mobilized from its deployment site at Camp Shields, Okinawa, to the Republic of the Philippines. The battalion worked around the clock the help the Subic Bay Naval Complex recover by clearing roadways and collapsed buildings, restoring utilities and building shelters in the area devastated by of volcanic ash.
In the wake of Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992, the battalion mounted out a 150 man Air Detachment and conducted the largest Seabee airlift ever as part of the disaster relief efforts in the communities of Homestead and Florida City, Florida. NMCB Four, along with nine other Seabee units, reopened a local school, cleared debris, restored utility services and provided valuable assistance to private residences, government facilities and volunteer organizations.
In December 1994, NMCB Four deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in support of Operation Sea Signal to construct facilities for 20,000 Cuban migrants. The 35 million dollar quality of life improvement program consisted of two cities on 125 and sites. Work included constructing 1,341 strong back tents, building 67 concrete block buildings, installing over of underground piping and of electrical cable and placing of concrete.
In 2002, NMCB Four sent its Air Detachment and Water Well Team to Basilian Island, Philippines, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines. The Air Detachment repaired roads, constructed sea huts, bridges and helicopter landing zones and installed water wells to support U.S. Forces.
During the 2003 deployment, NMCB Four deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) I to help sustain combat during combat operations, during this time NMCB 4 built and maintained roads, schools, police stations, prisons, and fire stations. NMCB 4 also constructed 6 Mabye Johnson bridges, pulled security and drove convoy missions from Kuwait to northern most cities of Iraq.

Saxon IIIb

The Saxon Class III b were German steam locomotives built for the Royal Saxon State Railways ("Königlich Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen") in the late 19th century as tender locomotives for express train duties. In 1925, the Deutsche Reichsbahn incorporated the engines into DRG Class 34.77-78.
Between 1873 and 1901, a total of 204 locomotives were delivered to the Royal Saxon State Railways by the firms of Hartmann, Henschel and Schwartzkopff. During the course of their manufacture there were continual modifications. Eighteen were built as compound engines. 
The Reichsbahn took over 91 machines and gave them the running numbers 34 7701, 34 7702, 34 7721–34 7808.
Rebuild of the Saxon Class III.
Later, 14 engines of the Saxon Class III were equipped with "Nowotny" steerable axles and also classified as Saxon IIIb locomotives. Of fourteen such engines, only one entered the Deutsche Reichsbahn where it was given the running number 52 7001.
The locomotives equipped with Saxon sä 3 T 7.5 und sä 3 T 9 tenders.

<doc id="19543879" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19543879" title="Countersteam brake">
Countersteam brake

A countersteam brake is a brake on a steam locomotive that uses the engine (specifically the cylinders) to help brake the locomotive.
It uses the working principle of steam cylinders fitted with slide or piston valves such that, by changing the configuration of the valve gear, the motion of the valves is also altered such that they work in opposition to the movement of the pistons.
Because of the inertia of a steam locomotive in its initial direction of travel, changing the direction in which the steam cylinders have to work acts first to brake the movement of the connecting rod, which in turn slows the transmission of power to the drive of the locomotive until it stops.
The countersteam brake is often confused with the counterpressure brake, which works with air, not steam, and acts as a dynamic brake. Unlike the countersteam brake, the counterpressure brake is permitted to be used as an independent braking system in its own right.
Operation.
The countersteam brake is actually not a brake in the true sense; but simply a way of using the working principle of a steam engine to produce a braking effect. It is therefore not a separate component of a steam locomotive. Countersteam braking is however only achievable with piston valves. On simple slide valves, no opposing steam admission is possible due to the way they are constructed.
Using the countersteam brake, experienced locomotive drivers can reverse the running direction of a steam locomotive almost as if it hasn't been brought to a stop, because the actual changeover point occurs whilst the locomotive is still moving in the initial direction of travel. This technique requires detailed knowledge and experience because if it is not carried out correctly, damage to the locomotive engine may result.
On steam locomotives without a second independent brake system (like e.g. a compressed-air brake, vacuum brake or steam brake) for the engine, in addition to the usual counterweight or fixed brake, the countersteam brake was used as a braking system. Today, steam locomotives generally have to have two independent brake systems in order to be licensed, so that the countersteam brake is not viewed as a braking system, but is nevertheless still used.

Japanese World War II destroyers

Japanese World War II destroyers included some of the most formidable of their day. This came as a nasty surprise to the Allies, who had generally underestimated Japanese technical capabilities. The Japanese had reassessed their naval needs in the mid-1920s and, placing an emphasis on ship and weapons technology and night fighting expertise, developed a completely new destroyer design. Subsequent development from one destroyer class to the next was not, however, a smooth progression. Aside from the usual changes arising from experience, serious design faults also came to light and naval treaties imposed restrictions. As a result, the early "Special Type" destroyers required significant changes and the specifications of subsequent classes was reduced in one way or another. Naval treaties were later abrogated in 1937 and so destroyer development continued without regard to limits.
Generally speaking, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) requirements gave rise to warships that were substantially larger than their European or American equivalents. In the early war years, their advantages were aggressively exploited against the often second rate and poorly coordinated Allied ships stationed in the region (as at the disastrous Battle of the Java Sea). The Japanese did not, however, continue to install new technology, such as radar, to match their opponents, and destroyer numbers were eroded steadily. The Japanese emphasis on fleet destroyers had neglected the need for large numbers of escort vessels to defend critical merchantmen, a need learnt by both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy in the Battle of the Atlantic. In recognition that quantity was as important as quality in some roles, design policy was therefore modified to produce units that were easier to build and operate. Despite this, Japan's destroyer force was halved by the end of the war. The survivors were given to the Allies.
Evolution.
The oldest Japanese destroyers at the declaration of war with the United States dated from World War I designs and were rated as "class 1" (greater than 1,000 tons (standard)) or "class 2" (under 1,000 tons (standard)). As these became outclassed and unsuitable for front line duties, they were relegated to coastal protection and convoy escort duties, including support of the landings in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), Philippines and Wake Island.
The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 assigned Japan a tonnage allocation with which it was dissatisfied. IJN planners assessed their needs to protect Japan's maritime lifelines with the assumption that their most likely opponent would be the United States. A total of 144 destroyers was deemed to be necessary. In order to achieve a long-ranged fleet, capable of operating far from home waters and bases, treaty limitations were disregarded. Japanese naval strategy assumed a major deciding battle against the United States and the destroyers' role would have been to harass and reduce the enemy in the lead up to such a battle. The resultant design was the , which were commissioned during 1928–1932. The "Fubuki"s became the basis for subsequent destroyer development, but they needed significant modification when stability and hull strength problems became apparent. These modifications were worked into new ship designs.
The Japanese produced some unusual and advanced features. The third group of "Fubuki"s introduced a unique splinterproof torpedo tube turret (later retrofitted), allowing the tubes to be reloaded in action. In addition, they introduced splinterproof, gas-tight turrets for the 5-inch guns, far ahead of their time. To increase comfort, the forecastle was raised and the bridge enlarged and enclosed, to offer protection against weather in the Pacific. Furthermore, in line with Japan's evident preference for two stacks, "Fubuki"s had an unusual siamesed design.
The London Naval Treaty added more restrictions to ship design and displacements were temporarily reduced ( and es) until Japan withdrew from the naval treaties. The subsequent s, s, and s resumed the design evolution and delivered the ships that the IJN desired, with substantially increased displacements. Further technical developments were prototyped in , but the design was not continued. Although the anti-aircraft (AA) defences of Japanese destroyers were shown to be inadequate, the IJN had recognised the need for fleet AA defence and the "Akizuki"s were intended to fill this need.
The IJN suffered one problem with their destroyers: small batches of different types, which made standardized spares and training (such as on powerplant) impossible. By contrast, the United States Navy's destroyer powerplant was standard across hundreds of ships.
A substantial number of Japanese destroyers were lost in 1942 in actions around the Solomon Islands. The urgent need for replacements necessitated design simplifications to improve construction speed and war experience prompted improvements to damage control and anti aircraft weaponry. The resultant s were commissioned in 1944.
Naming history.
Due to the anticipated expansion of the navy, the IJN originally issued numerical designations to every ship. However, the bland numerical designations were unpopular with the officers and crews. The IJN abolished destroyers' numerical designations in August 1928, reverting to names. The reverence held by the Japanese for the arts of war, promoted by the pre-war military governments, led to poetic sounding names for warships. Destroyers were allocated names associated with natural phenomena of weather, sky and sea, e.g., wind ("kaze"), snow ("yuki"), rain ("ame"), clouds ("kumo"), waves ("nami"), mist ("kiri"), frost ("shimo"), tides ("shio"), and the moon ("tsuki").
Statistics.
Excluding those ships that preceded the first "Special Type", or "Fubuki", destroyers, Japan had sixty-eight front-line destroyers in commission at the declaration of war with the Allies (in contrast to the 144 planners had proposed). A further sixty-four were commissioned during the war, but these failed to compensate for the losses incurred and the number of ships available declined steadily until mid-1944. There was a further catastrophic decline in October and November, 1944, when over twenty were lost. Only thirty-one survived hostilities. The high level of destroyer losses has been attributed to the poor effectiveness of their anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weaponry and radar, the aggressiveness with which they were used, and their being squandered on supply missions to Guadalcanal.
Survivors.
Despite the severe losses during the war, some Japanese destroyers survived. They were either scrapped or allocated as war reparation to one of the Allies (China, Netherlands, UK, USA or USSR).
Actions.
Japanese destroyers performed the usual range of tasks: fleet and convoy escorts, supply and reinforcement runs to various isolated island outposts and garrisons. Japanese destroyers were particularly skilled at night actions and the use of torpedo salvoes, tactics which attracted success in several actions. This advantage, however, was reduced by the Allies' use of superior radar and resources.
Badung Strait.
After the Japanese landings on Bali on February 19, 1942, two destroyers ( and ) were left to escort a transport to safety. In separate night actions, they engaged two superior ABDA flotillas, inflicted damage to one Allied cruiser () and sank a destroyer (). Both Allied flotillas withdrew.
Tassafaronga.
During the Solomon Islands Campaign, eight Japanese destroyers running supplies were surprised by five American cruisers and four destroyers. Despite the loss of one of the flotilla (), the Japanese launched a torpedo salvo to cover their withdrawal. Of the five U.S. cruisers, one was sunk () and three (, , and ) severely damaged.
At this stage in the war, the Allies were unaware of the range of the Type 93 torpedo (up to 40 km {25 sm}). The damage inflicted on the cruisers at Tassafaronga was, therefore, initially attributed to undetected submarines.
Cape St. George.
On 25/26 November 1943, six Japanese destroyers successfully delivered reinforcements to Buka Island at the northern end of the Solomon Islands. On their return to Rabaul, however, they were intercepted by five U.S. destroyers. Exploiting their superior radar, the Americans were able to make a torpedo attack before being detected. Three Japanese warships were lost (, and , without loss to the Americans. This was the last "Tokyo Express" supply operation.)
Classes.
"Momi".
Twenty-one vessels of the (樅, "Fir Tree") were built by Japan and commissioned in the early 1920s as second-class destroyers. They displaced 770 tons standard and carried three 4.7 in (120 mm) guns and four 21 in (53 cm) torpedo tubes.
By the outbreak of war with the United States in 1941, all had either been scrapped, reduced to non-combatant roles or were used for secondary escort work. Five survived the war and were scrapped soon after.
"Minekaze".
Thirteen (峯風, "Summit Wind") ships were commissioned between March 1920 and July 1922. They were developments of earlier classes, displaced 1,650 tons (full load) and carried four 4.7 in (120 mm) guns and six 21 in (53 cm) torpedo tubes. The siting of some of the weaponry was poor. Two of the four guns were placed amidships, one forward and one abaft the after funnel; in this position they had limited arcs of fire, being restricted by the ships' superstructure. One torpedo tube mounting was ahead of the bridge and liable to be washed over by heavy seas.
By the start of the war, these ships were no longer suitable for fleet duties, being used instead as escorts. Six survived the war.
"Wakatake".
Eight (若竹, "Young Bamboo") ships were commissioned between September 1922 and November 1923, seven (one lost in a storm in 1932) served in World War II, one re-rated as a patrol boat. They were small (1,100 tons) second-class destroyers, developed from the "Momi" class. Armament consisted of three 4.7 in (120 mm) guns (one replaced by two triple 25mm weapons in 1941–1942) and four 21 in (53 cm) torpedo tubes. Minesweeping and minelaying capabilities were replaced by depth charge launchers.
As with other destroyers of their age, they were unsuitable for fleet operations by the start of the war with the United States and served as escorts. Their shallow draft allowed their inshore use in China and the Philippines. One ship survived the war.
"Kamikaze".
Nine "Kamikaze"-class (神風, "Divine Wind") ships were commissioned between December 1922 and December 1924. They were similar to the "Minekaze" class, with an enlarged bridge and broader beam to compensate. The construction of this class was cut short by Japan's participation in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.
Ships of the class were active in several Japanese sea-borne landings in Malaya, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. In the last case, they defended the landings against the Allied cruisers and at the Battle of Sunda Strait. Two survived the war and were scrapped soon after.
"Mutsuki".
Twelve (睦月, "First Moon") ships were commissioned between November 1925 and July 1927. They were developed from the "Kamikaze" class and introduced the new 24 in (60 cm) Type 93 torpedo. These were in triple mounts, allowing the reduction of torpedo placements from three to two. Half of the class were rebuilt in 1935–36, receiving shields to the torpedo tubes, strengthened hulls and modifications to funnels. Further changes occurred in 1941–1942 when many were converted to fast transports, with reduced gunnery.
All "Mutsuki"-class ships were lost during the war.
"Fubuki".
The twenty (吹雪, "Snowstorm"), or "Special Type", destroyers were commissioned between May 1928 and May 1932. They were a completely new design and a radical change from their predecessors.
The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty had limited the tonnage of Japanese warships and, to counteract this, the IJN sought to build a high quality, technologically advanced navy. The "Fubuki"s resulted from this. Treaty provisions pointed to an individual ship displacement of 1,400 tons, but this was disregarded: the proposals of 1924 resulted in nearly 1,800 tons.
The design changes included 5-inch guns, twin mounted in weatherproof, splinter-proof turrets, the transfer aft of torpedo tubes from forward of the bridge, a high, covered bridge and an improved power plant. The new positioning of the torpedo tubes enabled the extension aft of the forecastle and thus greatly improved the ships' seakeeping. Two types of turret were fitted. Type A, with 40° elevation were superseded by Type B with 75° elevation, but neither were satisfactory as anti-aircraft mountings. Anti-aircraft weaponry was otherwise inadequate and it was progressively strengthened during refits, with a final count of 22 25 mm (1 in) guns in some vessels. The Type 93 torpedo had proved itself and was installed in this and all subsequent classes.
Although an impressive and powerful specification, the "Fubuki"s suffered from design flaws. In order to squeeze the required performance into the required displacement, weight had been saved by the use of light alloys, lighter machinery and the use of welded construction. The reduction of weight within the hulls, and the mass of superstructure, produced potentially unstable vessels, but this was not appreciated until March 1934, when the torpedo boat capsized and the IJN reviewed all of its ships' designs. In addition, five ships were severely damaged (in two instances, the bows were lost) in a typhoon and another five had lesser damage to their hulls.
As a result, in 1937 and 1938, all "Fubuki"s had their bridges and other superstructure reduced and magazines converted to oil storage (this would act as ballast). The last members of the class to be built were equipped with lighter Type C turrets with reduced elevation. Despite the increased weight (to 2,090 tons) leading to a loss of speed (by 1 knot {1.8 km/h, 1.2 mph}), these destroyers remained amongst the best warships of their type.
One ship survived the war.
"Akatsuki".
The four "Akatsuki"-class (暁, "Daybreak") ships were commissioned between August 1932 and March 1933. They were derived from the preceding "Fubuki" design. They were lighter than the "Fubuki"s, with less powerful machinery. Improved design meant they produced comparable power with just three boilers, rather than four. The bridge was enlarged, and new firecontrol systems were fitted. Torpedo tubes were fitted with shields, and reloads were carried.
They also had the same design issues of stability and hull strength which were similarly corrected. The resulting increase in displacement reduced their maximum speed to 34 kt (63 km/h, 39 mph).
"Hibiki" had the distinction of being IJN's first all-welded ship.
Three were lost during the war, and the lone survivor was transferred to the Soviet Union postwar.
"Hatsuharu".
The six (初春, "Early Spring") ships were commissioned between September 1933 and March 1935. They were reduced versions of the preceding "Akatsuki" design, resulting from the restrictions of the 1930 London Naval Treaty. A further six incomplete vessels were redesigned in the light of stability problems and eventually commissioned as "Shiratsuyu"s.
With much ingenuity, the Treaty limitations were (nearly) adhered to and displacement was a little over 1500 tons. Despite this, the "Hatsuharu"s retained all but one of the Special Types' 5 inch guns and introduced the oxygen-powered version of the 24 inch torpedo. They introduced a forward, superfiring single 5 inch gun and retained the tall bridge structure. The impact of the "Tomozuru" incident, which exposed the instability of contemporary Japanese warship designs, affected the "Hatsuharu"s and the two that had been completed and four more under construction were significantly redesigned. The forward single gun was moved aft to a lower position, the bridge and other structures were reduced or removed and ballast was added. Displacement increased to 2,090 tons and speed was consequently reduced.
These ships saw service throughout the Pacific, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands. All were lost before the Japanese surrender.
"Shiratsuyu".
The ten (白露, "White Dew") ships were commissioned between August 1936 and August 1937. They were redesigned "Hatsuhara"s (six, later increased to ten), in the light of the "Tomozuru" incident.
These were very similar to the "Hatsuharu"s but with a narrower and deeper hull and greater displacement (1,710 tons). The gun layout of the "Hatsuharu"s was retained but Type C gun houses were used and the torpedo mountings were quadruples, for the first time. The four added ships were further developed, showing an evolution into the succeeding "Asashio"s.
All ten were lost during the war.
"Asashio".
The ten (朝潮, "Morning Tide") ships were commissioned between August 1937 and June 1938. They were developments of preceding designs with the intention of combining the firepower of the "Fubuki"s with the designed stability of the "Shiratsuyu"s. The outcome was a displacement in excess of Japan's commitments under the London Naval Treaty, from which Japan had already decided to withdraw.
Six 5 inch guns were mounted in three Type C turrets, with the two aft turrets super-firing (i.e., one turret mounted higher than and firing over the other). Stability was sustained by an increase in the beam. Engine power was increased. Despite preceding experience, there were two significant defects in the design, however. Rudder design did not give the required turning circle and the stern was redesigned as transom. The new engines suffered damage to the turbine blades, a problem not solved until 1943.
The class was active in the landings in the Dutch East Indies, Battle of Midway and the Solomon Islands. All were lost during the war.
"Kagerō".
The eighteen-ship (陽炎, "Heat Haze") was commissioned between November 1939 and July 1941. In 1937, Japan withdrew from the London Naval Treaty and the "Kagerō"s were designed free of these restrictions, utilising experience drawn from previous classes.
The outcome was a class of ships exceeding 2,500 tons. Solutions to the stability problems of earlier classes were incorporated in the design, with a lower bridge and a slightly wider and deeper hull. Weaponry was restored to the six 5 inch guns of the "Fubuki"s, in Type C mountings, and eight 24 inch torpedoes, in two quadruple mountings with improved reloading facilities, were also fitted. New engines and machinery layouts were used to improve performance and weight. As completed, there was no improvement to anti-submarine and anti-aircraft (AA) weaponry, somewhat surprisingly in view of Japan's commitment to naval aviation and the anti-aircraft capability of the subsequent "Akizuki" class. During 1943 and 1944, however, the AA outfit was improved on the surviving ships and radar was fitted.
Ships of the class screened the force that attacked at Pearl Harbor. They were also present in the Philippines, Midway and the Dutch East Indies. One ship survived the war: it was ceded to China.
"Shimakaze".
Within a significantly larger hull that displaced 2,600 tons, a new turbine design gave 50% more power than earlier designs and enabled trials speeds of over 40 knots (74 km/h, 46 mph). The standard six five-inch guns were retained but in Type D turrets with greater elevation. The larger hulls allowed 15 torpedo tubes in three quintuple mounts. During 1943/44, the AA gunnery was improved and radar was fitted.
The class, of which "Shimakaze" was the prototype, was not ordered. She was sunk in the Philippines in November, 1944.
"Yūgumo".
The twenty (夕雲, "Evening Clouds") ships were commissioned between September 1941 and May 1944. They were continuation of the earlier "Kagerō" class, with some changes.
The hull was marginally longer and broader and the main guns were mounted in Type D turrets. The anti-aircraft weaponry was improved during 1943–44, completed ships had one 5 inch turret removed to allow room for additional 25 millimetre weapons, but incomplete ones had extra space built in and retained all six 5 inch guns. Ships of this class commissioned in March 1942 and later were the first Japanese destroyers to be completed with radar (Types 13 and 22).
All of the class were lost during the war.
"Akizuki".
The sixteen "Akizuki"-class (秋月, "Autumn Moon") ships were commissioned between June 1942 and January 1945. They were originally intended as anti-aircraft ships, but were instead completed as general purpose destroyers. This class was the first to be equipped with radar.
The design diverged from the IJN destroyer standard of six 5 in (127 mm) guns, instead mounting eight 3.9 in (100 mm) high-velocity guns in four high angle mountings. Their rapid fire, 90° elevation and excellent AA fire control system provided an effective dual purpose weapon to the Imperial Japanese Navy for the first time. In fact, the 100 mm's range and rate of fire both exceeded the U.S. Navy's standard 5 in (127 mm)/38 calibre. Four 24in torpedo tubes and depth charge throwers were added as the requirements changed to a general-purpose warship. The heavier gun mountings and the extra super-firing mounting required a significantly larger hull than the "Yūgumo"s to ensure stability. The class displaced 2,740 tons.
The class was incomplete at the end of the war, three were cancelled and one was scrapped before its launch. A further 32 planned ships to improved designs ("Arashikaru" and "Yamatsuki" groups) were cancelled due to raw material shortages. Six "Akizuki"s survived the war of which two were scrapped and four were ceded to Allied navies (China, UK, USA, USSR).
"Matsu".
The eighteen (松, "Pine Tree") destroyers were commissioned between April 1944 and January 1945. This class were a simplified destroyer design introduced to speed construction times and intended to be used for escort and supply missions. The urgent need for replacements arose from the severe losses around the Solomon Islands in 1942.
The design criteria were speed of build, improved damage-control and anti-aircraft and torpedo capabilities. The hull design was simplified and shorter than the "Fubuki"s, partly due to a reduction in the number of boilers, which itself resulted in a significant reduction in speed. The heretofore standard six 5 inch, 50 calibre weapons were replaced by three Type 89 5 inch/40 calibre guns which performed better than its predecessor in an AA role. The enclosed turrets were also replaced by a forward single open shield and an aft twin open mounting. This major redesign delivered a significantly smaller ship (1,280 tons). A number of the class were modified to transport "kaiten".
Eleven additional ships were cancelled and replaced by a greater number of "Tachibana"s. Seven "Matsu"s were sunk during the war, three were scrapped and eight were ceded to Allied navies.
"Tachibana".
Fourteen (橘, "Tachibana orange") ships were commissioned between January and June 1945. Another four were launched but not completed and five were not launched before the Japanese surrender. They were a development of the "Matsu" class, with further simplifications to the design.
Four were lost in ports or home waters in the final weeks of the war and the remainder were scrapped or given to Allied navies.
Weapons systems.
Radar.
The first radar sets were installed in Japanese destroyers in March 1942, initially in newly commissioned ships of the "Yūgumo" class. This continued at an increasing rate through 1943 and 1944, with retro-fitting of existing and even older, pre-1922, vessels.
Type 13.
Aircraft detection radar experimentally introduced in 1941, widely fitted from March 1943. Effective up to .
Type 21.
Used for aircraft and ship detection; introduced in August 1943. Effective against aircraft up to 100 kilometres and against ships up to . It was the first Japanese set capable of deriving height estimates for aircraft.
Type 22.
Used for aircraft and ship detection up to 35 km and 34.5 km, respectively. Introduced in August 1943. It was also capable of gunnery control and became the most widely installed Japanese naval set.

Salvia divinorum

Salvia divinorum (also known as Diviner's Sage, Ska María Pastora, Seer's Sage, and by its genus name Salvia) is a psychoactive plant which can induce "visions" and other hallucinatory experiences. Its native habitat is in cloud forest in the isolated Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it grows in shady and moist locations. The plant grows to over a meter high, has hollow square stems, large leaves, and occasional white flowers with violet calyxes. Botanists have not determined whether "Salvia divinorum" is a cultigen or a hybrid; native plants reproduce vegetatively, rarely producing viable seed.
Mazatec shamans have a long and continuous tradition of religious use of "Salvia divinorum", using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions. Most of the plant's local common names allude to the Mazatec belief that the plant is an incarnation of the Virgin Mary, with its ritual use also invoking that relationship. Its chief active psychoactive constituent is a structurally unique diterpenoid called "salvinorin A", a potent κ-opioid and D2 receptor agonist. "Salvia divinorum" is generally understood to be of low toxicity (high ) and low addictive potential since it is a κ-opioid agonist and a great deal of research has indicated that κ-opioid agonist activation of the kappa opioid receptor as shown by salvia may, in fact, serve as a potent addiction treatment therapy.
"Salvia divinorum" remains legal in most countries and, within the United States, is legal in the majority of states. However, some have called for its prohibition. While not currently regulated by US federal drug laws, several states have passed laws criminalizing the substance. Some proposed state bills have failed to progress and have not been made into law (with motions having been voted down or otherwise dying in committee stages). There have not been many publicized prosecutions of individuals violating anti-salvia laws in the few countries and states in which it has been made illegal.
History.
"Salvia divinorum" is native to the Sierra Mazateca in Oaxaca, Mexico, where it is still used by the Mazatec, primarily to facilitate shamanic visions in the context of curing or divination. "S. divinorum" is one of several species with hallucinogenic properties that are ritually used by Mazatec shamans. Others include certain morning glory seeds ("Turbina corymbosa"), psilocybin mushrooms, and various coleus species. In their rituals, the shamans use only fresh "S. divinorum" leaves. They see the plant as an incarnation of the Virgin Mary, and begin the ritual with an invocation to Mary, Saint Peter, the Holy Trinity, and other saints. Ritual use traditionally involves being in a quiet place after ingestion of the leaf—the Maztec shamans say that "La Maria ("S. divinorum") speaks with a quiet voice."
It is also used remedially at lower dosages as a diuretic, and to treat ailments including diarrhea, anemia, headaches, rheumatism, and a semi-magical disease known as "panzón de borrego", or a swollen belly (literally, "lamb belly").
The history of the plant is not well known, and there has been no definitive answer to the question of its origin. Speculation includes "Salvia divinorum" being a wild plant native to the area; a cultigen of the Mazatecs; or a cultigen introduced by another indigenous group. Botanists have also not been able to determine whether it is a hybrid or a cultigen.
Academic discovery.
"Salvia divinorum" was first recorded in print by Jean Basset Johnson in 1939 while he was studying Mazatec shamanism. He later documented its usage and reported its effects through personal testimonials. It was not until the 1990s that the psychoactive mechanism was identified by a team led by Daniel Siebert.
Gordon Wasson tentatively postulated that the plant could be the mythological "pipiltzintzintli", the "Noble Prince" of the Aztec codices. Wasson's speculation has been the subject of further debate amongst ethnobotanists, with some scepticism coming from Leander J. Valdés, and counterpoints more supportive of Wasson's theory from Jonathan Ott.
The identity of another mysterious Aztec entheogen, namely that of "poyomatli", has also been suggested as being "Salvia divinorum".
Here too there are other candidate plants, notably Cacahuaxochitl ("Quararibea funebris"), again suggesting that there is no consensus.
Etymology.
The genus name, "Salvia", was first used by Pliny for a plant that was likely "Salvia officinalis" (common sage) and is derived from the Latin "salvere". The specific epithet, "divinorum", was given because of the plant's traditional use in divination and healing. it is often loosely translated as "diviner's sage" or "seer's sage". Albert Hofmann, who collected the first plants with Wasson, objected to the new plant being given the name "divinorum":
I was not very happy with the name because "Salvia divinorum" means "Salvia of the ghosts", whereas "Salvia divinatorum", the correct name, means "Salvia of the priests", But it is now in the botanical literature under the name "Salvia divinorum".
There are many common names for "S. divinorum", most of them relating to the plant's association with the Virgin Mary. The Mazatec believe the plant to be an incarnation of the Virgin Mary, so they take great care in handling the plant. The name "Ska Maria Pastora", often shortened to "Ska Maria" or "Ska Pastora", refers to "the leaf or herb of Mary, the Shepherdess." Other Spanish names include "hojas de Maria", "hojas de la Pastora", "hierba (yerba) Maria", and "la Maria". A plant believed to be "S. divinorum" was referred to as "hoja de adivinacion" (leaf of prophecy) by the Cuicatec and Mazatec. "S. divinorum" is also known as "la hembra" ("the female"), when it is included by the Mazatec as part of a family of similar religious hallucinogens. The others it is connected with are "Coleus pumila", called "el macho" ("the male"), and two forms of "Coleus blumei" which are called "el nene" ("the child") and "el ahijado" ("the godson").
Some researchers see the lack of an indigenous Mazatec name as demonstrating a non-Mazatec origin for the plant. Others point out that the Virgin Mary is not normally viewed as a shepherdess in Christianity, and that image may hint at a pre-Hispanic Mazatec cultural reference to the plant.
Recent history.
"Salvia divinorum" has become both increasingly well-known and available in modern culture. The Internet has allowed for the growth of many businesses selling live salvia plants, dried leaves, extracts, and other preparations.
Medical experts, as well as accident and emergency rooms, have not been reporting cases that suggest particular salvia-related health concerns, and police have not been reporting it as a significant issue with regard to public order offences; in any case, "Salvia divinorum" has attracted negative attention from the media and some lawmakers.
Media stories generally raise alarms over "Salvia divinorum"'s legal status and are sometimes headlined with generally ill-supported comparisons to LSD or other psychoactive substances. Parental concerns are raised by focusing on salvia's usage by younger teens—the emergence of YouTube videos purporting to depict its use being an area of particular concern in this respect. The isolated and controversial suicide of Brett Chidester received much media attention.
"Salvia divinorum" was the subject of the first use of YouTube within drug-behavioral research when scientists at San Diego State University rated randomly selected videos of salvia users to study observed impairment. Their findings corroborate reports that the most profound effects of smoking salvia appear almost immediately and last about eight minutes. Effects include temporary speech and coordination loss.
Botany.
"Salvia divinorum" has large green ovate (often also dentate) leaves, with a yellow undertone that reach 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in) long. The leaves have no hairs on either surface, and little or no petiole. The plant grows to well over in height, on hollow square stems which tend to break or trail on the ground, with the plant rooting quite readily at the nodes and internodes.
The flowers, which bloom only rarely, grow in whorls on a inflorescence, with about six flowers to each whorl. The flowers are white, curved and covered with hairs, and held in a small violet calyx that is covered in hairs and glands. When it does bloom in its native habitat, it does so from September to May.
Early authors erred in describing the flowers as having blue corollas, based on Epling and Játiva's description. The first plant material they received was dried, so they based the flower color on an erroneous description by Hofmann and Wasson, who didn't realize that their "blue flowers, crowned with a white dome" were in fact violet calyces with unopened white corollas.
Distribution and habitat.
"Salvia divinorum" is endemic to the Sierra Mazateca in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico, growing in the primary or secondary cloud forest and tropical evergreen forest at elevations from . Its most common habitat is black soil along stream banks where small trees and bushes provide an environment of low light and high humidity.
Reproduction.
"Salvia divinorum" produces few viable seeds even when it does flower—no seeds have ever been observed on plants in the wild. For an unknown reason, pollen fertility is also comparatively reduced. There is no active pollen tube inhibition within the style, but some event or process after the pollen tube reaches the ovary is aberrant. The likeliest explanations are inbreeding depression or hybridity. All of the Mazatec populations appear to be clonal. The plant's square stems break easily and tend to trail on the ground, rooting easily at the nodes and internodes.
Taxonomy.
"Salvia divinorum" was first documented in 1939, but it was many years before botanists could identify the plant due to Mazatec secrecy about the growing sites. Flowers were needed for a definitive identification of the species. In 1962, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann, and ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson, traveled throughout the Sierra Mazateca researching Mazatec rituals and looking for specimens of the plant. They were unable to locate live plants. Eventually, the Mazatec provided them some flowering specimens. These specimens were sent to botanists Carl Epling and Carlos D. Játiva, who described and named the plant as "Salvia divinorum", after its use in divination and healing by the Mazatec. By 1985, up to fifteen populations of the plant had been found.
Until 2010, there were differing opinions on whether "Salvia divinorum" is an interspecific hybrid. The plant's partial sterility was suggestive of a hybrid origin, though no two parent species have been found with an obvious affinity to "Salvia divinorum". One other possibility for the plant's partial sterility is that long-term cultivation and selection have produced an inbred cultigen.
In 2010, a molecular phylogenetic approach by DNA sequencing of "Salvia divinorum" and a number of related species strongly suggest that the species is not a hybrid. One earlier proposed parent was "Salvia cyanea" (a synonym for "Salvia concolor"), which Epling and Játiva believed to be closely allied to "Salvia divinorum". The 2010 study demonstrated "Salvia divinorum"'s closest relative to be "Salvia venulosa"—a rare and endemic "Salvia" that is native to Colombia, growing in shaded, wooded gullies at elevation. It also showed that "Salvia divinorum" does not belong to the "Salvia" section "Dusenostachys", as believed earlier. The genetic study also indicated that "Salvia venulosa" was likely misplaced into "Salvia" section "Tubiflorae", and that it may not be related to other Colombia "Salvia" species, though further tests are needed.
The origin of "Salvia divinorum" is still a mystery, one of only three plants in the extensive "Salvia" genus (approximately 900 species) with unknown origins—the other two are "Salvia tingitana" and "Salvia buchananii".
Strains.
There are two commonly cultivated strains which are known to be distinct. One is the strain that was collected in 1962 by ecologist and psychologist Sterling Bunnell (the "Bunnell" strain), colloquially mis-attributed as the "Wasson-Hofmann strain". The other was collected from Huautla de Jiménez in 1991 by anthropologist Bret Blosser (the "Blosser" or "Palatable" strain). There are other strains that are not as well documented, such as the "Luna" strain (possibly "Bunnell") isolated from a Hawaiian patch of "Salvia divinorum" clones, featuring unusually serrated and rounded rather than ovate leaves.
Cultivation.
Propagation by cuttings.
"Salvia divinorum" is usually propagated through vegetative reproduction. Small cuttings, between two and eight inches long, cut off of the mother plant just below a node, will usually root in plain tap water within two or three weeks.
Flowering.
Blooms occur when the day length becomes shorter than 12 hours (beginning in mid-October in some places), necessitating a shade cloth in urban environments with exposure to light pollution (HPS).
Chemistry.
The known active constituent of "Salvia divinorum" is a "trans"-neoclerodane diterpenoid known as salvinorin A (chemical formula C23H28O8). This compound is present in the dried plant at about 0.18%.
Salvinorin A is not an alkaloid, (meaning it does not contain a basic nitrogen), unlike most known opioid receptor ligands. Salvinorin A is the first documented diterpene hallucinogen.
Similar to many psychoactive herbs, "Salvia divinorum" synthesizes and excretes its active constituent (salvinorin A) via trichomes, of the peltate-glandular morphology, located just beneath the cuticle (subcuticular) layer.
Potency.
By mass, salvinorin A "is the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen." It is active at doses as low as 200 µg. Synthetic chemicals, such as LSD (active at 20–30 µg doses), can be more potent. Research has shown that salvinorin A is a potent and selective κ-Opioid (kappa-Opioid) receptor agonist. It has been reported that the effects of salvinorin A in mice are blocked by κ-Opioid receptor antagonists. However, it is an even more potent D2 receptor partial agonist, and it is likely this action plays a significant role in its effects as well. Salvinorin A has no actions at the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, the principal molecular target responsible for the actions of 'classic' hallucinogens, such as mescaline and LSD, nor is it known to have affinity for any other sites to date.
Salvinorin's potency should not be confused with toxicity. Rodents chronically exposed to dosages many times greater than those to which humans are exposed show no signs of organ damage.
Other terpenoids.
Other terpenoids have been isolated from "Salvia divinorum", including other salvinorins and related compounds named divinatorins and salvinicins. None of these compounds has shown significant (sub-micromolar) affinity at the κ-Opioid receptor, and there is no evidence that they contribute to the plant's psychoactivity.
Other pharmaceutical action.
Salvinorin A is capable of inhibiting excess intestinal motility (e.g. diarrhea), through a combination of κ-opioid and cannabinoid (mainly CB1 receptor) receptors in "inflamed" but not normal gut "in vivo". The mechanism of action for Salvinorin A on ileal tissue has been described as 'prejunctional', as it was able to modify electrically induced contractions, but "not" those of exogenous acetylcholine. Results from a small study by an assistant professor at the University of Iowa indicate that it may have potential as an analgesic and as a therapeutic tool for treating drug addictions.
A pharmacologically important aspect of the contraction-reducing (antispasmodic) properties of ingested Salvinorin A on gut tissue is that it is only pharmacologically active on "inflamed" and "not" normal tissue, thus reducing possible side-effects.
Ingestion.
There are a few ways to consume "Salvia divinorum". In traditional Mazatec ritual, shamans use only fresh "Salvia divinorum" leaves. Modern methods have been developed to more effectively absorb the active principle, salvinorin A. If enough salvinorin A is absorbed, an altered state of consciousness can occur. The duration of experience varies with the method of ingestion and the amount of salvinorin A absorbed.
Traditional methods.
Mazatec shamans crush the leaves to extract leaf juices from about 20 to 80 (about 50g/2 oz to 200g/7 oz.) or more fresh leaves. They usually mix these juices with water to create an infusion or 'tea' which they drink to induce visions in ritual healing ceremonies.
Chewing and swallowing a large number of fresh leaves is the other Mazatec method. Oral consumption of the leaf makes the effects come on more slowly, over a period of 10 to 20 minutes. The experience, from the onset of effects, lasts from about 30 minutes up to one and a half hours.
Doses for chewing vastly exceed doses used for smoking. By calculating the concentrations per leaf ("an average concentration of 2.45 mg per gram" of leaf), the average weight per leaf ("about 50 g" per 20 leaves, or 2.5g/leaf), and the standard dose for chewing (about 8-28 leaves), the doses can range from about 50 mg to 172 mg.
Modern methods.
Modern methods of ingestion include smoking or chewing the leaf, or using a tincture, as described in the following sections.
Smoking.
Dry leaves can be smoked in a pipe, or through the use of a water pipe to cool the smoke. The temperature required to release salvinorin from the plant material is quite high (about 240°C). A cooler flame will work, but the direct application of a more intense flame, such as that of a torch lighter, is often preferred.
Some find that untreated dry leaf produces unnoticeable or only light effects. Concentrated preparations or extracts which may be smoked in place of untreated leaves, have become widely available. This enhanced (or "fortified") leaf is described by a number followed by an x (e.g. "5x", "10x"), the multiplicative factors being generally indicative of the relative amounts of leaf concentrate, though there is no accepted standard for these claims. Other sources may use a system of color codes to form their own standards of potency; for example, "green", "yellow", and "red."
These grades of potency may be roughly indicative of the relative concentration of the active principle, (salvinorin A), but the measure should not be taken as absolute. Overall extract potency will depend on the (naturally varying) strength of the untreated leaf used in preparing the extract, as well as the efficiency of the extraction process itself. Extracts reduce the overall amount of inhalations needed to ingest a given amount of active principle, thus facilitating more powerful experiences.
If salvia is smoked, then the main effects are experienced quickly. The most intense 'peak' is reached within a minute or so and lasts for 1–5 minutes, followed by a gradual tapering off. At 5–10 minutes, less intense yet still noticeable effects typically persist, giving way to a returning sense of the everyday and familiar until back to baseline after about 15 to 20 minutes.
Quid chewing.
The traditional method of chewing the leaves has continued in modern use. However, salvinorin A is generally considered to be inactive when orally ingested, as salvinorin A is effectively deactivated by the gastrointestinal system. Therefore, in what's understood to be a modern innovation, the 'quid' of leaves is held in the mouth as long as possible in order to facilitate absorption of the active constituents through the oral mucosa. 'Quid' refers to the fact that at the end of this method the user spits out the leaves rather than swallowing them because ingesting the leaves has no known effect. Chewing consumes more of the plant than smoking, and produces a longer-lasting experience.
Using a tincture.
Less commonly, some may ingest salvia in the form of a tincture. This is administered sublingually, usually with the aid of a glass dropper. It may be taken diluted with water just before use, which may slightly reduce the intensity of its effects, but can also serve to lessen or avoid a stinging sensation in the mouth caused by the presence of alcohol. Tinctures vary in potency, and the effects can range from inducing a mild meditative state to bringing about a more intense visionary one.
When taken as a tincture the effects and duration are similar to other methods of oral ingestion, though they may be significantly more intense, depending on extract potency.
Immediate effects.
Psychedelic experiences are necessarily somewhat subjective and variations in reported effects are to be expected. Aside from individual reported experiences there has been a limited amount of published work summarising the effects. D.M. Turner's book "Salvinorin—The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum" quotes Daniel Siebert's summarisation, mentioning that the effects may include:
There also may be synesthetic experiences. Glossolalia (speaking in tongues) has been reported by "Reason".
A survey of salvia users found that 38% described the effects as unique in comparison to other methods of altering consciousness. 23% said the effects were like yoga, meditation or trance.
One firsthand journalistic account has been published in the UK science magazine "New Scientist" (note: the dose for this experience was not reported):
There have been few books published on the subject. One notable example is Dale Pendell's work ""Pharmako/Poeia—Plants Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft"", which won the 1996 Firecracker Alternative Book Award and has a chapter dedicated to "Salvia divinorum". It includes some experience accounts:
Other users have written extensive prose and/or poetry about their experiences; some describe their visions pictorially, and there exist examples of visionary art which are 'salvia-inspired'. Others claim musical inspiration from the plant: including "Salvia divinorum" by 1200 Micrograms, "Salvia" by Deepwater Sunshine, and "Flight 77" by Paul Dereas.
Cautionary notes.
Dale Pendell expresses some concerns about the use of highly concentrated forms of salvia. In its natural form salvia is more balanced and benevolent, and quite strong enough, he argues. High strength extracts on the other hand can show ""a more precipitous, and more terrifying, face"" and many who try it this way may never wish to repeat the experience.
The "Salvia Divinorum User's Guide" recommends having a trip sitter present to those who are new to salvia, are experimenting with a stronger form, or are using a more effective method of ingestion.
The guide says that while the effects of salvia are generally quite different from those of alcohol, like alcohol, it impairs coordination. It also emphasizes that salvia is not a 'party drug.'
Vaporization.
Daniel Siebert cautions that inhaling hot air can be irritating and potentially damaging to the lungs. Vapor produced by a heat gun needs to be cooled by running it through a water pipe or cooling chamber before inhalation.
After-effects.
Short term.
After the peak effects, normal awareness-of-self and the immediate surroundings return but lingering effects may be felt. These short-term lingering effects have a completely different character than the peak experience. About half of users report a pleasing 'afterglow', or pleasant state of mind following the main effects. Researchers from the University of California and California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute conducted a survey of 500 salvia users which identified that they 'sometimes or often' experience certain effects, including:
Other commonly reported effects include:
Long term.
Differing studies suggest no consensus so far with regard to the long-term effects of "Salvia divinorum" on mood. It is well-established that some k-opioid agonists can cause dysphoria in humans. One study using rats in forced-swim tests has been used to suggest that "Salvia divinorum" may have "depressive-like" effects, although this conclusion has been contradicted by subsequent research. However, a report has been published detailing an individual case of "Salvia divinorum" use as self-medicated treatment for depression, and Baggott's survey of 500 people with firsthand experience of salvia found that 25.8% of respondents reported improved mood and "antidepressant-like effects" lasting 24 hours or longer. Only 4.4% reported persisting (24 hours or more) negative effects (most often anxiety) on at least one occasion.
There has been one report of salvia precipitating psychosis. However, the authors suspected that their patient was already genetically predisposed to schizophrenia.
It has been suggested that the long-term effects of salvia use may include feelings of déjà vu.
The Baggott survey found little evidence of addictive potential (chemical dependence) in its survey population. 0.6% percent of respondents reported feeling addicted to or dependent on salvia at some point, and 1.2% reported strong cravings. About this the researchers said "there were too few of these individuals to interpret their reports with any confidence".
Most users report no hangover or negative after-effects (e.g. withdrawal, comedown or rebound effect) the next day. This is consistent with the apparent low toxicity of salvia indicated by research conducted at the University of Nebraska.
Therapeutic potential.
Aside from individual reports of self-medicated use in the treatment of depression, research suggests that "Salvia divinorum", in line with the studied effects of other κ-opioid agonists, may have further therapeutic potential.
Thomas Prisinzano, assistant professor of medicinal and natural products chemistry at the University of Iowa, has suggested that salvia may help treat cocaine addiction:
Professor Bryan L. Roth, director of the National Institute on Mental Health's Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, has said:
Clinical pharmacologist John Mendelsohn has also said:
An ABC news story which reported on this went on to suggest "the excitement could vanish overnight if the federal government criminalized the sale or possession of salvia, as the Drug Enforcement Agency is considering doing right now." A proposed Schedule I classification would mean (among other things) that there's no ""currently accepted medical use"" as far as the United States government is concerned. Scientists worry that such legislation would restrict further work. Mendelsohn said scheduling salvia could scare away a great deal of research and development into salvia's therapeutic promise.
Controversy.
The relatively recent emergence of "Salvia divinorum" in modern Western culture, in comparison to its long continuing traditions of indigenous use, contrasts widely differing attitudes on the subject.
Opinions range from veneration of the plant as a spiritual sacrament or "a gift from the gods", to 'threat to society', to be banned as quickly as possible in order to "spare countless families the horror of losing a loved one to the relentless tentacles of drug abuse".
Media coverage.
Interest in "Salvia divinorum" has been escalating in the news media, particularly in the United States, where an increasing number of newspaper reports have been published and television news stories broadcast.
These stories generally raise alarms over salvia's legal status. Headlining for example with comparisons to LSD, or describing it as "the new pot" for instance, with parental concerns being raised by particular focus on salvia's use by younger teens.
Story headlines may also include 'danger' keywords, such as "Dangerous Herb is Legal..." or "Deadly Dangers Of A Street Legal High".
Mainstream news coverage and journalistic opinion has widely been negative on the subject. In a local news report aired on ABC affiliate WJLA in Washington, DC on July 11, 2007, the anchors are seen to exchange expressions of incredulity when referring to a salvia story with the following introduction "Now, an exclusive I-Team investigation of a hallucinogenic drug that has begun to sweep the nation. What might amaze you is that right now the federal government is doing nothing to stop it".
In March 2008 a Texas news report aired with the story "A legal drug that teenagers are now using to get high could soon be banned here in San Antonio - all because of a Fox News 4 investigation", going on to say, "The drug is legal in Texas, at least for now. But a News 4 investigation could lead to a new ordinance to protect your kids."
Many salvia media stories headline with comparisons to LSD. However, while LSD and salvia's active constituent salvinorin A may have comparative potencies, in the sense that both can produce their effects with low dosage amounts, they are otherwise quite different. The two substances are not chemically similar or related, as salvinorin A is found naturally in a single plant while LSD is chemically semisynthesized from lysergamides like ergotamine. They are ingested in different ways and produce different effects, which manifest themselves over different timescales. For example, the effects of salvia when smoked typically last for only a few minutes as compared to LSD, whose effects can persist for 8–12 hours.
Brett's law.
A particular focus of many US media stories is the long-running coverage of the case of Brett Chidester, a 17-year-old Delaware student who committed suicide in January 2006 by carbon monoxide poisoning.
Reportedly, some months before this, Brett's mother Kathleen Chidester had learned about his salvia use and questioned him about it. Brett said that he had ceased his experimentation, but his parents did not believe that he was telling the truth. They have instead argued that salvia-induced depression was largely to blame for his death. Some of Brett's earlier writings about his salvia experiences have been used to suggest that it made him think "existence in general is pointless." Some media stories have referred to these earlier written experience reports as if they were part of Brett's suicide note. In any case, a law was soon passed in Delaware classifying the herb as a Schedule I controlled substance in that state. This legislation was nicknamed Brett's law (formally referred to as Senate bill 259).
Although the Chidester story has been given continued exposure by US media, there has not been anywhere else, either before or since this controversial incident, any other reported cases involving or alleging "Salvia divinorum" as a serious factor in suicide, overdose, accidental, or any other kind of death. Regarding this, San Francisco attorney Alex Coolman has commented, "It's remarkable that Chidester's parents, and "only" Chidester's parents, continue to be cited over and over again by the mainstream media in their coverage of the supposed 'controversy' over the risks of "Salvia divinorum"."
Kathleen Chidester has continued campaigning for "Schedule I"-like legislation beyond their home state of Delaware. For example, three years after Brett's death, in written testimony in support of Senator Richard Colburn's proposed Senate Bill to the Maryland State Legislature, saying, "My hope and goal is to have salvia regulated across the US. It's my son's legacy and I will not end my fight until this happens."
Usage shown on YouTube.
A reported concern has been the emergence of YouTube videos showing alleged salvia users laughing uncontrollably, apparently unable to perform simple tasks or to communicate. In an interview with California-based newspaper the "San Francisco Chronicle", published in June 2007, Daniel Siebert was quoted as saying: 
"Those videos are certainly not going to help the situation. They make salvia look like some horrible drug that makes people nuts and dangerous [...]" and "The sad thing is it creates this public image where people don't realize there are sensible ways to use something like this."
"The New York Times" has reported that "in state after state [...] the YouTube videos have become "Exhibit A" in legislative efforts to regulate salvia."
Waco Representative Charles Anderson (R), who is sponsoring one of several bills to ban salvia in Texas saying, "When you see it, well, it sure makes a believer out of you." Anderson told colleagues at a legislative hearing about a video that depicts a salvia user behind the wheel of a car. 
"What we really worry about," said Mr. Anderson at the hearing, "is youngsters doing this and then getting in a vehicle or getting on a motorcycle or jumping in a pool somewhere."
Michigan Representative Michael Sak (D) submitted a bill which proposed Schedule I classification of "Salvia divinorum" and salvinorin A. He said that if people had questions about the deleterious effects of salvia, they should go on YouTube to watch the videos. A reporter questioned Sak as to whether he had ever seen a "Girls Gone Wild" video, and whether that would incite him to make alcohol illegal (Sak replied that he hadn't yet had a chance to review the material).
Nebraska Senator Vickie McDonald said: 
"Anytime anything's on YouTube it's an issue," and "Legislators, parents, grandparents, we need to be on top of these things," [...] "We need to protect our children..."
Senator McDonald of Nebraska proposed Schedule I listing "Salvia divinorum" as part of their Controlled Substances Act, under which possession of salvia would have been considered a Class IV felony with a penalty of up to five years and trafficking would have fallen under a Class III felony with up to a 20 year penalty.
In Massachusetts, YouTube videos were shown by a retired police officer to public health and judiciary committees as evidence in favor of outlawing it there.
The issue has been raised of whether the salvia videos are in breach of YouTube's own community guidelines, which ask users not to "cross the line" and post videos showing "bad stuff" like "drug abuse". The question is considered as particularly problematical as the videos may be something of an enforcement grey area.
Legal status.
At present "Salvia divinorum" remains legal in most countries. Countries where salvia is controlled in some manner include:
Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Japan, the United States, Russia, Spain, and Sweden.
The prohibitive degree of "Salvia divinorum" legislation varies widely from country to country. Australia has imposed its strictest 'schedule 9' (US Schedule I equivalent), and Italy has also placed salvia in its 'Table I' of controlled substances (also US Schedule I equivalent). In Spain, there are controls focusing only on the commercial trade of "Salvia divinorum", personal cultivation (i.e. for non-commercial use) is not targeted.
Salvia legislation may prove difficult to enforce. The plant has a nondescript appearance; unlike many other drug plants, the leaves are non-descript, and without a detectable odour. "Salvia divinorum" can be grown as an ordinary houseplant without the need of special equipment such as hydroponics or high-power lights.
UK legality.
In the United Kingdom, following a local newspaper story in October 2005, a parliamentary Early Day Motion was raised calling for "Salvia divinorum" to be banned there. However, it only received 11 signatures. A second motion raised in October 2008 attracted 18 signatures, and it was reported that Mann had also written to Jacqui Smith, then Home Secretary. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the independent body that advises UK government on drugs, was asked to investigate further.
US legality.
National legislation for amendment of the Controlled Substances Act to place salvinorin A and "Salvia divinorum" in Schedule I at the federal level in the United States was proposed in 2002 by Representative Joe Baca (D- California). Those opposed to bill HR 5607 include Daniel Siebert, who sent a letter to Congress arguing against the proposed legislation, and the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics (CCLE), who sent key members of the US Congress a report on "Salvia divinorum" and its active principle, along with letters from an array of scientists who expressed concern that scheduling "Salvia divinorum" would negatively impact important research on the plant. The bill did not pass.
Although salvia is not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act, some American states, including Alabama, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Texas and others, have passed their own laws. Several other states have proposed legislation against salvia, including Alaska, California, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. Many of these proposals have not made it into law, with motions having failed, stalled or otherwise died, for example at committee review stages.
Where individual state legislation does exist, it varies from state to state in its prohibitive degree.
"Salvia divinorum" has been banned by various branches of the U.S. military and some military bases.
Internet sale.
Some internet vendors will not sell live "salvia" cuttings, leaf, or leaf products to states where its use is restricted or prohibited.
Per their drugs and drug paraphernelia policy, eBay does not permit sale of "Salvia divinorum" or derived products (despite legality in most areas).
Opinions and arguments.
Concerns expressed by some politicians on the subject of Salvia reflect those of the media, with comparisons to LSD and particular focus on "protecting our children" being echoed; and with legislative proposals following soon after news stories breaking.
Some arguments against Salvia have been of a preventative nature, "We need to stop this before it gets to be a huge problem not after it gets to be a huge problem," or of an imitative nature, "The Australians have clearly found a problem with it. There's obviously a risk in people taking it." Concerns about driving while under the influence of Salvia have also been expressed.
Opponents of more prohibitive measures against Salvia argue that such reactions are largely due to an inherent prejudice and a particular cultural bias rather than any actual balance of evidence, pointing out inconsistencies in attitudes toward other more toxic and addictive drugs such as alcohol and nicotine. While not objecting to some form of legal control, in particular with regard to the sale to minors or sale of enhanced high-strength extracts, most salvia proponents otherwise argue against stricter legislation.
Those advocating consideration of "Salvia divinorum"'s potential for beneficial use in a modern context argue that more could be learned from Mazatec culture, where salvia is not really associated with notions of drug taking at all and it is rather considered as a spiritual sacrament. In light of this it is argued that "Salvia divinorum" could be better understood more positively as an entheogen rather than pejoratively as a hallucinogen.
Public opinion.
Despite its growing notoriety in some circles, media stories generally suggest that the public at large are still mostly unaware of salvia, with the majority perhaps having never even heard of it.
Although published responses may not necessarily be representative of public opinion as a whole, some news agencies generally support reader and viewer feedback in connection with their stories.

Orchidelirium

Orchidelirium is the name given to the Victorian era of flower madness when collecting and discovering orchids reached extraordinarily high levels. Wealthy orchid fanatics of the 19th century sent explorers and collectors to almost every part of the world in search of new varieties of orchids. Orchidelirium is seen as similar to Dutch tulip mania. Today there still exists some levels of orchid madness, that has some times resulted in theft of exceptional orchids among collectors such as the Ghost Orchid.
History.
Cultivation of orchids started in England in 19th century. Orchids were brought to Europe by companies or individuals who had financed collecting expeditions. Commissioned professional collectors would travel for months all over the world in search of rare new species. These expensive expeditions were often shrouded in secrecy and it was not unusual for collectors to spread misleading information about the locations where new orchids were found.
New exotic orchids were most often sold at auction in London, fetching extravagant prices.
During this time very little was known about the cultivation of orchids and their survival rate was dismal.
Through experimentation and by gathering more information on the growing conditions of orchids in their natural habitat, knowledge was slowly being developed and by 1851 B. S. Williams published the first edition of “The Orchid Grower’s Manual”. Today, the collecting of orchids in the wild is now banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) adopted in 1973. Still some orchids are endangered. Orchid smuggling is thought to contribute to the loss of some species of orchid in the wild.

Albert Cheesebrough

Albert Cheesebrough (born 17 January 1935) is an English former footballer. A forward, he scored 88 goals in 345 leagues games over a sixteen-year professional career in the Football League.
Turning professional with Burnley in 1951, he spent the next eight years at the club, making 158 appearances in league and cup competitions. Signing with Leicester City in 1959, he went on to play for the "Foxes" in the 1961 FA Cup Final. He moved on to Port Vale in 1963, and after recovering from injury he became the club's top-scorer in 1964–65, before he transferred to Mansfield Town in 1965. He spent two years with Mansfield before he was forced to retire due to injury. He won one cap for the England under-23s in 1956.
Club career.
Born in Burnley, Lancashire, he joined Burnley as a 15-year-old in the summer of 1950, after a series of outstanding performances as captain of his school team, Rosegrove, and for representative schoolboy teams at town and county level for Lancashire. He signed professional terms on his 17th birthday in January 1952, and made his First Division debut against Manchester United three months later, before notching his first senior goal against Chelsea in April 1952. Though he played five games in 1951–52, he featured just once in 1952–53 and then played eight times in 1954–55 after failing to make an appearance in the entirety of the 1953–54 campaign.
After manager Frank Hill was replaced by Alan Brown, Cheesebrough became a regular for the "Clarets" at inside-forward in the 1955–56 season, linking up well on the left-wing with Brian Pilkington. He scored six goals in his 41 appearances. On 7 November 1957, he score a hat-trick in a 7–3 victory over Leicester City. He finished the 1956–57 season with 12 goals in 45 games. He retained his first team place under new boss Billy Dougall, and bagged 14 goals in 42 games in the 1957–58 season. However Dougall was replaced by Harry Potts, who favoured upcoming youngster Jimmy Robson ahead of Cheesebrough, limiting him to seven goals and 18 appearances in 1958–59. In total Cheesebrough made 158 appearances, scoring 40 goals, in his nine years at Turf Moor.
He was sold to Matt Gillies's Leicester City in June 1959 for a fee of £20,000. At Filbert Street, Cheesebrough was the club's top-scorer in 1959–60 with 17 goals in 45 appearances. He then hit 12 goals in 42 games in 1960–61, and was part of the City side who were defeated 2–0 by Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup Final at Wembley. He scored 11 goals in 26 games in 1961–62, as City posted a 14th place finish in the league. He hit three goals in 25 games in 1962–63, but was not included in the "Foxes" side that lost to Manchester United in the 1963 FA Cup Final.
He moved to Freddie Steele's Port Vale for a then club record fee of £15,000 in July 1963. He opened his account at Vale Park with a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Brentford on 16 September. In November of that year however he underwent a cartilage operation, and his recovery kept him out of action for the rest of the 1963–64 season; he scored seven goals in 27 games that season.
He proved his determination by returning to fitness in the 1964–65 season and finishing as the club's top-scorer, though with a grand total of seven goals in 32 games it was the first time since David Bowcock in 1917–18 that such a low total earned a player this accolade. The "Valiants" scored just 41 goals all season long, and the arrival of Jackie Mudie could not prevent an inevitable relegation out of the Third Division. He moved on to Mansfield Town on a free transfer in July 1965. The "Stags" were managed by former teammate Tommy Cummings. He made 24 Third Division appearances at Field Mill in 1965–66 and 1966–67, before a broken leg ended his career.
International career.
He also made one appearance for England at Under-23 level against France at Bristol City's Ashton Gate Stadium in 1956.
Post-retirement and family.
After retiring from the game he went on to run a butcher's shop business in Southport; he had learned the ropes of the meat trade whilst playing at Port Vale.
His daughter, Susan, represented Great Britain at the 1980 Summer Olympics as a gymnast, and was British national champion in 1978 and 1979. His grandfather, also named Albert Cheesebrough, was killed by sniper fire shortly after the Second Battle of Krithia in World War I.

Homeowners Refinancing Act

The Homeowners Refinancing Act (also known as the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 and the Home Owners' Loan Corporation Act) was an Act of Congress of the United States passed as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal during the Great Depression to help those in danger of losing their homes. The act, which went into effect on June 13, 1933, provided mortgage assistance to homeowners or would-be homeowners by providing them money or refinancing mortgages.
Sponsored by Senate Majority leader Joe Robinson of Arkansas, it also created the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), building off of Herbert Hoover's Federal Loan Bank Board. The Corporation lent low-interest money to families in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. By the mid-1930s, the HOLC had refinanced nearly 20% of urban homes in the country.
History.
New Deal.
Having won a decisive victory in the United States presidential election of 1932, and with his party having decisively swept Congressional elections across the nation, Roosevelt entered office with unprecedented political capital. Americans of all political persuasions were demanding immediate action, and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of new programs in the “first hundred days” of the administration, in which he met with congress for 100 days. During those 100 days of lawmaking, Congress granted every "request" Roosevelt asked.
Congressional.
The original "Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933", , , was enacted June 13, 1933. The 1st Annual Report of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board refers to this act as the "Home Owners' Loan Corporation Act". An unnamed act, , further amended this act to guarantee the bonds of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation.

Midtown Community Court

The Midtown Community Court is a municipal court of law established in 1993 in the Times Square neighborhood of New York City. The court focuses on quality-of-life offenses, such as prostitution, shoplifting, farebeating and vandalism. The court, which is located on West 54th Street in Manhattan, has been replicated both in the United States, in cities including Austin, Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon, and abroad, in countries as varied as South Africa, Great Britain, Canada, and Australia.
The Midtown Community Court was established as a collaboration between the New York State Unified Court System and the Center for Court Innovation. The court relies on partnerships with local residents, businesses and social service agencies to organize community restitution projects and provide on-site social services, including drug treatment, mental health counseling, and job training. Unlike most conventional courts, the Midtown Court combines punishment and help, requiring low-level offenders to pay back the neighborhood through community service while mandating them to receive social services to address problems that often underlie criminal behavior.
The court was the subject of an independent evaluation by the National Center for State Courts. According to the National Center, the court's compliance rate of 75 percent for community service was the highest in the city. Offenders performing community service contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of labor to the community each year. In conjunction with aggressive law enforcement and economic development efforts, the court has had an impact on neighborhood crime: prostitution arrests dropped 56 percent and illegal vending was down 24 percent.

Pintle injector

A pintle injector is a type of propellant injection device for a rocket engine that was first used on a flight vehicle during the Apollo Program in the Lunar Excursion Module's descent engine. Pintle injectors are currently used in SpaceX's Merlin engines.
History.
The origins of the pintle injector were early laboratory experimental apparatus, used by Caltech and JPL in the mid-1950s, to study propellant mixing and combustion reaction times of hypergolic liquid propellants. The pintle injector was reduced to practice and developed by Space Technology Laboratories (STL), then a division of Ramo-Wooldridge Corp., later TRW starting in 1960; however, it was not until October 1972 that for invention of the pintle injector was granted to Gerry Elverum, of TRW and made public.
Description.
A pintle injector is a coaxial injector. Propellant stream A (fuel or oxidizer) flows through an outer tube, coming out as a cylindrical stream, while propellant stream B (complement of A) flows in an inner tube and impinges on a pintle shaped similarly to a car-engine poppet valve, which causes B to spray outward in a broad cone or flat sheet that intersects the cylindrical stream of propellant A. In some variants the pintle has grooves cut into it to produce radial jets in the flow of propellant B.
If propellant B is the fuel and A the oxidizer, the pintle arrangement can be set up to get fuel-film cooling of the inside of the combustion chamber essentially automatically; also, pintle injectors allow deep throttling without large losses in combustion efficiency. (Many people have experienced throttleable pintle sprayers in the form of standard garden hose-end sprayers.)

Charlotte Hatherley

Charlotte Franklin Hatherley (born 20 June 1979) is an English guitarist and singer-songwriter. She initially came to prominence as guitarist and backing vocalist for alternative rock band Ash. Since leaving Ash in 2006, she has pursued a solo career and also acted as a touring instrumentalist for Client, KT Tunstall and Bat for Lashes. Hatherley is now performing under the moniker of Sylver Tongue.
Biography.
Ash (1997–2006).
Born in London, Hatherley was brought up in West London and attended Chiswick Community School. Her music career began at the age of sixteen, when she played in obscure British punk band Nightnurse. Around this time, Ash were looking for a fourth member, a guitarist, to add to their live sound. Ash frontman Tim Wheeler was present at a Nightnurse gig and thought Hatherley fitted the bill. Hatherley's Ash debut was at Belfast's Limelight on 10 August 1997, and the following week the new lineup played the 1997 V Festival in front of 50,000 people. Her recording debut with the band happened later that year on the single "A Life Less Ordinary" and then on the album "Nu-Clear Sounds" in 1998.
Hatherley was credited with writing for a handful of Ash's songs, the most notable being "Grey Will Fade", on the B-side of the single "There's a Star". The song was a cult favourite among fans, and eventually became the title track of Hatherley's debut solo album.
It was during the period of recording the album "Meltdown" with Ash that Hatherley began to record her own album "Grey Will Fade" simultaneously, fully encouraged by the rest of the band. From the album she released the singles "Bastardo", "Kim Wilde" and "Summer", which all, as well as the album itself, received high praise from critics.
Solo (2006–2011).
On 20 January 2006 it was announced that Hatherley would be leaving Ash in an amicable breakup. This decision was initially thought to be based on Hatherley's intention to pursue a solo career further, although it later emerged she was asked to leave by the remaining three members.
Hatherley's second album, "The Deep Blue" was released on 5 March 2007. It was preceded by two singles; "Behave", in December, and "I Want You To Know", in February, along with an accompanying UK and Ireland tour. Two more singles were released to promote the album, "Siberia" and "Again". In 2007, Hatherley also opened for Blondie on their UK tour and played guitar for Bryan Ferry. In November 2007 she joined Client to fill the vacant role of bassist on their European tour.
In October 2008, Cinnabar City was announced as the title of Hatherley's third solo album, although this was later changed to "New Worlds". The track "Full Circle" debuted on BBC 6 Music's: The Nemone Show on 23 December. The album was released on 16 October 2009. Simultaneously, Hatherley announced on her official website that she would be joining Bat for Lashes as a live member of the band throughout 2009.
Daily Music Guide critic Jamie Smith described the second single from "New Worlds", "Alexander", as "a rather super single that deserves to win her many more new fans". and the same writer described the album, for The Music Magazine, as "a record that has a very definite sheen of quality all over it. Gone all the rough edges of her debut Grey Will Fade, and the sound is a huge leap forward from the lo-fi and somewhat dreary and unformed follow-up The Deep Blue. New Worlds is the album of a woman sure of herself and ready to move forward in her career".
In 2010 Hatherley joined KT Tunstall's band, playing lead guitar and replacing Sam Lewis. The 2010/11 tour, coinciding with the release of Tunstall's "Tiger Suit" album, began 19 October in Cambridge, England. "The Times" review of the 20 October concert at the Shepherds Bush Empire, London, noted "Hatherley played with a decisive touch and was a powerful stage presence, her bright copper hair and glacial poise providing an engaging foil to Tunstall’s more natural look and breezy, upbeat stage persona".
In an interview with the "Galway Advertiser", on 13 January 2011, Tunstall said that Hatherley had helped her "to find the voice that she had always been searching for. Charlotte has just blown us all away. She’s an exceptionally talented musician and very visceral. It’s just pure emotion when she plays. It was interesting seeing her take on the role because it’d been a while since she’d had a full on lead guitar gig. This is probably the most heavy-riffed stuff I’ve ever written. I had all these tribal backing vocal bits planned and suddenly I discovered Charlotte could do them all. Our voices are spookily similar and it’s nice for me to have another girl in the band. Neither of us are super girly girl and we’re both really into our music".
Sylver Tongue (2012-present).
In February 2012, Hatherley began performing under the new name of Sylver Tongue, with a song entitled "Hook You Up" made available for free download. This was followed by the four-track Something Big EP, released on CD, digital and vinyl in November 2012, featuring the tracks "Something Big", "Hook You Up", "Creatures" and "Faraway Sun". Sylver Tongue, as a four-piece line-up, supported Bat for Lashes on their October/November 2012 UK tour.
Personal life.
Hatherley's ex-boyfriend is film director Edgar Wright, who is best known for "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz". He directed videos for two of her singles, "Summer" and "Bastardo". Her mother, Patricia Franklin, is an actress who appeared in several "Carry On" films of the 1960s and 1970s. She is thanked in the credits for both "Shaun of the Dead", and "Hot Fuzz". She is also credited on the UK DVD of "Shaun of the Dead" for taking photographs of the crew. Her father, Frank Hatherley, is an Australian playwright and critic.

Acyclic model

In algebraic topology, a discipline within mathematics, the acyclic models theorem can be used to show that two homology theories are isomorphic. The theorem was developed by topologists Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane. They discovered that, when topologists were writing proofs to establish equivalence of various homology theories, there were numerous similarities in the processes. Eilenberg and MacLane then discovered the theorem to generalize this process.
It can be used to prove the Eilenberg–Zilber theorem.
Statement of the theorem.
Let formula_1 be an arbitrary category and formula_2 be the category of chain complexes of formula_3-modules. Let formula_4 be covariant functors such that:
Then the following assertions hold:
Generalizations.
Projective and acyclic complexes.
What is above is one of the earliest versions of the theorem. Another
version is the one that says that if formula_27 is a complex of
projectives in an abelian category and formula_28 is an acyclic
complex in that category, then any map formula_29 extends to a chain map formula_30, unique up to
homotopy.
This specializes almost to the above theorem if one uses the functor category formula_31 as the abelian category. Free functors are projective objects in that category. The morphisms in the functor category are natural transformations, so the constructed chain maps and homotopies are all natural. The difference is that in the above version, formula_12 being acyclic is a stronger assumption than being acyclic only at certain objects.
On the other hand, the above version almost implies this version by letting formula_1 a category with only one object. Then the free functor formula_11 is basically just free (and hence projective) module. formula_12 being acyclic at the models (there is only one) means nothing else than that the complex formula_12 is acyclic.
Acyclic classes.
Then there is the grand theorem that unifies them all. Let formula_37 be an abelian category (for example formula_2 or formula_31). A class formula_40 of chain complexes over formula_41 will be called an acyclic class provided:
There are three natural examples of acyclic classes, although doubtless
others exist. The first is that of homotopy contractible complexes.
The second is that of acyclic complexes. In functor categories (e.g. the
category of all functors from topological spaces to abelian groups),
there is a class of complexes that are contractible on each object, but
where the contractions might not be given by natural transformations.
Another example is again in functor categories but this time the complexes are acyclic only at certain objects.
Let formula_55 denote the class of chain maps between complexes
whose mapping cone belongs to formula_40. Although
formula_55 does not necessarily have a calculus of either right
or left fractions, it has weaker properties of having homotopy classes
of both left and right fractions that permit forming the class
formula_58 gotten by inverting the arrows in
formula_55.
Let formula_60 be an augmented endofunctor on formula_43,
meaning there is given a natural transformation
formula_62 (the identity functor on formula_43). We say that the chain complex formula_27 is formula_60-"presentable" if for each formula_66, the chain
complex
belongs to formula_40. The boundary operator is given by
We say that the chain complex functor formula_28 is
formula_60-"acyclic" if the augmented chain complex
formula_72 belongs to formula_40.
Theorem. "Let formula_40 be an acyclic class and
formula_55 the corresponding class of arrows in the category of
chain complexes. Suppose that formula_27 is formula_60-presentable and formula_28 is formula_60-acyclic.
Then any natural transformation formula_80
extends, in the category formula_81 to a natural
transformation of chain functors formula_82 and this is
unique in formula_81 up to chain homotopies.
If we suppose, in addition, that formula_28 is formula_60-presentable, that formula_27 is formula_60-acyclic, and that formula_88 is an isomorphism, then formula_24 is homotopy equivalence.
Example.
Here is an example of this last theorem in action. Let formula_90
be the category of triangulable spaces and formula_43 be the
category of abelian group valued functors on formula_90. Let
formula_27 be the singular chain complex functor and formula_28
be the simplicial chain complex functor. Let formula_95 be the functor that assigns to each space formula_90 the
space formula_97. Here, formula_98 is the formula_66-simplex and this functor assigns to formula_90 the sum of as many copies of each
formula_66-simplex as there are maps formula_102.
Then let formula_60 be defined by formula_104. There is an
obvious augmentation formula_105 and this induces one on
formula_60. It can be shown that both formula_27 and
formula_28 are both formula_60-presentable and
formula_60-acyclic (the proof that formula_28 is not entirely
straigtforward and uses a detour through simplicial subdivision, which
can also be handled using the above theorem). The class formula_40 is the class of homology equivalences. It is rather
obvious that formula_113 and so we conclude that
singular and simplicial homology are isomorphic on formula_90.
There are many other examples in both algebra and topology, some of
which are described in M. Barr, Acyclic Models. AMS, 2002.

Kathy Konst

Kathy Konst is a former legislator and political candidate in western New York state. From 2006 to 2009, she represented Erie County's 5th County Legislature District, was a candidate for the 59th New York State Senate District in the 2008 general election, and she is now the Commissioner of Environment, Planning, and Economic Development for Erie County, New York.
Early life.
Konst is originally from Chicago, Illinois, and moved to Lancaster, New York in 1992.
Also prior to being elected, Konst worked in environmental education and economic development for Florida Atlantic University and Palm Beach County, and owned a small marketing company. She also served as the head of the Lancaster Area Chamber of Commerce, concurrently with her legislative responsibilities.
Issue positions.
One of Konst's main advocacy issues has been government reform, particularly term limits for state and local officials, and balancing the budget of Erie County, which was in a financial crisis at the time of her election in 2005. As chair of the Finance and Management Committee, she opposed the siphoning off of money from the Upstate Revitalization Fund to pay for projects in New York City, as well as unnecessary spending within Erie County.
Children and seniors issues are also heavily emphasized, ranging from education and lead-poisoning prevention to heating and energy assistance for low-income families and the elderly.
Electoral history.
Konst was first elected to the Erie County legislature in 2005, in a victory against incumbent Denise Marshall after receiving the support of the local Democratic Committee, and won reelection in 2007.
In the 2008 state senate race, she defeated Tim Pawarski in the Democratic primary by margins greater than three to one, despite the latter's endorsement by the local Democratic Committee. She went on to face incumbent Dale Volker in the general election on November 4, losing by a 56 to 44 margin. The 59th Senate District was among several upstate Senate districts that allegedly was targeted in the last several days of the campaign with illegal robocalls misinforming voters.
Effective August 17, 2009, Konst resigned from both her legislative seat and her position as head of the Lancaster Area Chamber of Commerce in order to take a position as the Commissioner of Environment and Planning for Erie County. Kathy Konst received criticism from Democratic Party activists for taking the position because it impaired the ability of the local Democratic Committee to field a competitive candidate in the following election. She was temporarily replaced in the Legislature by Diane M. Terranova. Following a suit by the Erie County Democratic Committee to remove Konst from their ballot line, the replacement Democratic nominee lost to Republican Dino Fudoli in November 2009. Despite withdrawing from the race, Konst received 21% of the vote on her remaining minor party ballot lines.

<doc id="19544100" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19544100" title="Albert Hofmann">
Albert Hofmann

Albert Hofmann (January 11, 1906 – April 29, 2008) was a Swiss scientist known best for being the first person to synthesize, ingest, and learn of the psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Hofmann was also the first person to isolate, synthesize, and name the principal psychedelic mushroom compounds psilocybin and psilocin. He authored more than 100 scientific articles and numerous books, including "LSD: My Problem Child". In 2007 he shared first place, alongside Tim Berners-Lee, in a list of the 100 greatest living geniuses, published by "The Telegraph" newspaper.
Life and career.
Hofmann was born in Baden, Switzerland, the first of four children to factory toolmaker Adolf Hofmann and his wife Elisabeth (born Elisabeth Schenk). Owing to his father's low income, Albert's godfather paid for his education. When his father became ill, Hofmann obtained a position as a commercial apprentice in concurrence with his studies. At the age of twenty, Hofmann began his chemistry degree at the University of Zürich, finishing three years later, in 1929. His main interest was the chemistry of plants and animals, and he later conducted important research on the chemical structure of the common animal substance chitin, for which he received his doctorate, with distinction, in the spring of 1929.
Regarding his decision to pursue a career as a chemist, Hofmann provided insight during a speech he delivered to the 1996 Worlds of Consciousness Conference in Heidelberg, Germany:
Discovery of LSD.
Hofmann became an employee of the pharmaceutical-chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories (now a subsidiary of Novartis), located in Basel as a co-worker with professor Arthur Stoll, founder and director of the pharmaceutical department. He began studying the medicinal plant squill and the fungus ergot as part of a program to purify and synthesize active constituents for use as pharmaceuticals. His main contribution was to elucidate the chemical structure of the common nucleus of the "Scilla" glycosides (an active principal of Mediterranean Squill). While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on November 16, 1938. The main intention of the synthesis was to obtain a respiratory and circulatory stimulant (an analeptic) with no effects on the uterus in analogy to nikethamide (which is also a diethylamide) by introducing this functional group to lysergic acid. 
It was set aside for five years, until April 16, 1943, when Hofmann decided to reexamine it. While re-synthesizing LSD, he accidentally absorbed a small quantity through his fingertips and fortuitously discovered its powerful effects. He described what he felt as being:
Three days later, on April 19, 1943, Hofmann intentionally ingested 250 micrograms of LSD. This day is now known as "Bicycle Day," because after starting to feel the effects of the drug he rode home on a bike, and that became the first intentional acid trip.
Further research.
Hofmann, later, was to discover 4-Acetoxy-DET (4-acetoxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine), also known as ethacetin, ethylacybin, or 4-AcO-DET, a hallucinogenic tryptamine. He first synthesized 4-AcO-DET in 1958 in the Sandoz lab. Hofmann became director of the natural products department at Sandoz and continued studying hallucinogenic substances found in Mexican mushrooms and other plants used by the aboriginal people there. This led to the synthesis of psilocybin, the active agent of many "magic mushrooms." Hofmann also became interested in the seeds of the Mexican morning glory species "Turbina corymbosa", the seeds of which are called "ololiuhqui" by the natives. He was surprised to find the active compound of ololiuhqui, ergine (LSA, lysergic acid amide), to be closely related to LSD.
In 1962, he and his wife Anita Hofmann née Guanella (born Guanella, sister of Gustav Guanella, an important Swiss inventor) traveled to southern Mexico to search for the plant "Ska Maria Pastora" (Leaves of Mary the Shepherdess), later known as "Salvia divinorum". He was able to obtain samples of this plant, but never succeeded in identifying its active compound, which has since been identified as the diterpenoid salvinorin A. In 1963, Hofmann attended the annual convention of the World Academy of Arts and Sciences (WAAS) in Stockholm.
Later years.
Hofmann, interviewed shortly before his hundredth birthday, called LSD "medicine for the soul" and was frustrated by the worldwide prohibition of it. "It was used very successfully for ten years in psychoanalysis," he said, adding that the drug was misused by the Counterculture of the 1960s, and then criticized unfairly by the political establishment of the day. He conceded that it could be dangerous if misused, because a relatively high dose of 500 microgrammes will have an extremely powerful psychoactive effect, especially if administered to a first-time user without adequate supervision.
In December 2007, Swiss medical authorities permitted psychotherapist Peter Gasser to perform psychotherapeutic experiments with patients who suffer from terminal-stage cancer and other deadly diseases. Completed in 2011, these experiments represent the first study of the therapeutic effects of LSD on humans in 35 years, as other studies have focused on the drug's effects on consciousness and body. Hofmann acclaimed the study, and continued to say he believed in the therapeutic benefits of LSD. In 2008, Hofmann wrote to Steve Jobs, asking him to support this research; it is not known if Jobs responded. The Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has supported research in the field of psychoanalysis using LSD, carrying on Hofmann's legacy and setting the groundwork for future studies.
Hofmann was due to speak at the World Psychedelic Forum from March 21 to March 24, 2008, but was forced to cancel because of bad health.
Death.
Hofmann died of a heart attack on April 29, 2008 and was survived by several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He and his wife, Anita, reared four children, one of whom died at the age of 53. Hofmann revealed that LSD had not affected his understanding of death and explained "I go back to where I came from, to where I was before I was born, that’s all.”
Honors and awards.
The "Swiss Federal Institute of Technology" (ETH Zurich) honored him with the title D.Sc. (honoris causa) in 1969 together with Gustav Guanella, his brother-in-law. In 1971 the Swedish Pharmaceutical Association ("Sveriges Farmacevtförbund") granted him the Scheele Award, which commemorates the skills and achievements of the Swedish Pomeranian chemist and pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele.

Claude Lévi-Strauss

Claude Lévi-Strauss (; 28 November 1908 – 30 October 2009) was a French anthropologist and ethnologist, and has been called, along with James George Frazer and Franz Boas, the "father of modern anthropology". The work of Lévi-Strauss was also key in the development of the theory of structuralism and structural anthropology. 
He was honored by universities throughout the world and held the chair of Social Anthropology at the Collège de France (1959–1982), and was elected a member of the Académie française in 1973.
He argued that the "savage" mind had the same structures as the "civilized" mind and that human characteristics are the same everywhere. These observations culminated in his famous book "Tristes Tropiques", which positioned him as one of the central figures in the structuralist school of thought, where his ideas reached into many fields in the humanities, as well as sociology and philosophy. Structuralism has been defined as "the search for the underlying patterns of thought in all forms of human activity."
Biography.
Early life, education, and career.
Claude Lévi-Strauss was born to French parents with Jewish background who were living in Brussels at the time, where his father was working as a painter. He grew up in Paris, living on a street of the 16th arrondissement named after the artist Claude Lorrain, whose work he admired and later wrote about. During the First World War, he lived with his maternal grandfather, who was the rabbi of the synagogue of Versailles. He attended the Lycée Janson de Sailly and the Lycée Condorcet.
At the Sorbonne in Paris, Lévi-Strauss studied law and philosophy. He did not pursue his study of law, but agrégated in philosophy in 1931. In 1935, after a few years of secondary-school teaching, he took up a last-minute offer to be part of a French cultural mission to Brazil in which he would serve as a visiting professor of sociology at the University of São Paulo while his wife, Dina, served as a visiting professor of ethnology.
The couple lived and did their anthropological work in Brazil from 1935 to 1939. During this time, while he was a visiting professor of sociology, Claude undertook his only ethnographic fieldwork. He accompanied Dina, a trained ethnographer in her own right who was also a visiting professor at the University of São Paulo, where they conducted research forays into the Mato Grosso and the Amazon Rainforest. They first studied the Guaycuru and Bororo Indian tribes, staying among them for a couple of days. In 1938 they returned for a second, more than half-year-long expedition to study the Nambikwara and Tupi-Kawahib societies. At this time his wife suffered an injury that prevented her from completing the study, which he concluded. This experience cemented Lévi-Strauss's professional identity as an anthropologist. Edmund Leach suggests, from Lévi-Strauss's own accounts in "Tristes Tropiques", that he could not have spent more than a few weeks in any one place and was never able to converse easily with any of his native informants in their native language, which is uncharacteristic of anthropological research methods of participatory interaction with subjects to gain a full understanding of a culture.
In the 1980s he suggested why he went vegetarian in pieces published in Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica and other publications anthologized in the posthumous book "Nous sommes tous des cannibales" (2013): "A day will come when the thought that to feed themselves, men of the past raised and massacred living beings and complacently exposed their shredded flesh in displays shall no doubt inspire the same repulsion as that of the travellers of the 16th and 17th century facing cannibal meals of savage American primitives in America, Oceania or Africa."
Expatriation.
Lévi-Strauss returned to France in 1939 to take part in the war effort, and was assigned as a liaison agent to the Maginot Line. After the French capitulation in 1940, he was employed at a lycée in Montpellier, but then was dismissed under the Vichy racial laws. (Lévi-Strauss's family, originally from Alsace, was of Jewish ancestry.) By the same laws, he was denaturalized (stripped of French citizenship). He managed to escape Vichy France by boat to Martinique, from where he was finally able to travel on. In 1941, he was offered a position at the New School for Social Research in New York, and granted admission to the United States. A series of voyages brought him, via South America, to Puerto Rico where he was investigated by the FBI after German letters in his luggage aroused the suspicions of customs agents. Lévi-Strauss spent most of the war in New York City. Together with other intellectual emigrés, he taught at the New School for Social Research. Along with Jacques Maritain, Henri Focillon, and Roman Jakobson, he was a founding member of the École Libre des Hautes Études, a sort of university-in-exile for French academics.
The war years in New York were formative for Lévi-Strauss in several ways. His relationship with Jakobson helped shape his theoretical outlook (Jakobson and Lévi-Strauss are considered to be two of the central figures on which structuralist thought is based). In addition, Lévi-Strauss was also exposed to the American anthropology espoused by Franz Boas, who taught at Columbia University. In 1942, while having dinner at the Faculty House at Columbia, Boas died of a heart attack in Lévi-Strauss's arms. This intimate association with Boas gave his early work a distinctive American inclination that helped facilitate its acceptance in the U.S. After a brief stint from 1946 to 1947 as a cultural attaché to the French embassy in Washington, D.C., Lévi-Strauss returned to Paris in 1948. At this time he received his doctorate from the Sorbonne by submitting, in the French tradition, both a "major" and a "minor" thesis. These were "The Family and Social Life of the Nambikwara Indians" and "The Elementary Structures of Kinship".
Structural anthropology.
"The Elementary Structures of Kinship" was published the next year and quickly came to be regarded as one of the most important anthropological works on kinship. It was even reviewed favorably by Simone de Beauvoir, who viewed it as an important statement of the position of women in non-western cultures. A play on the title of Durkheim's famous "Elementary Forms of the Religious Life", "Elementary Structures" re-examined how people organized their families by examining the logical structures that underlay relationships rather than their contents. While British anthropologists such as Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown argued that kinship was based on "descent" from a common ancestor, Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship was based on the "alliance" between two families that formed when women from one group married men from another.
Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, Lévi-Strauss continued to publish and experienced considerable professional success. On his return to France, he became involved with the administration of the CNRS and the Musée de l'Homme before finally becoming professor (directeur d'études) of the fifth section of the École Pratique des Hautes Études, the 'Religious Sciences' section where Marcel Mauss was previously professor, the title of which chair he renamed "Comparative Religion of Non-Literate Peoples".
While Lévi-Strauss was well known in academic circles, in 1955 he became one of France's best known intellectuals by publishing "Tristes Tropiques", published in Paris that year by Plon (and translated into English in 1973, published by Penguin). Essentially, this book was a memoir detailing his time as a French expatriate throughout the 1930s, and his travels. Lévi-Strauss combined exquisitely beautiful prose, dazzling philosophical meditation, and ethnographic analysis of the Amazonian peoples to produce a masterpiece. The organizers of the Prix Goncourt, for instance, lamented that they were not able to award Lévi-Strauss the prize because "Tristes Tropiques" was non-fiction.
Lévi-Strauss was named to a chair in Social Anthropology at the Collège de France in 1959. At roughly the same time he published "Structural Anthropology", a collection of his essays which provided both examples and programmatic statements about structuralism. At the same time as he was laying the groundwork for an intellectual program, he began a series of institutions to establish anthropology as a discipline in France, including the Laboratory for Social Anthropology where new students could be trained, and a new journal, "l'Homme", for publishing the results of their research.
In 1962, Lévi-Strauss published what is for many people his most important work, "La Pensée Sauvage", translated into English as "The Savage Mind". The French title is an untranslatable pun because the word "pensée" means both "thought" and "pansy," while "sauvage" has a range of meanings different from English "savage." Lévi-Strauss supposedly suggested that the English title be "Pansies for Thought", borrowing from a speech by Ophelia in Shakespeare's "Hamlet" (ACT IV, Scene V). French editions of "La Pensée Sauvage" are often printed with an image of wild pansies on the cover.
"The Savage Mind" discusses not just "primitive" thought, a category defined by previous anthropologists, but forms of thought common to all human beings. The first half of the book lays out Lévi-Strauss's theory of culture and mind, while the second half expands this account into a theory of history and social change. This latter part of the book engaged Lévi-Strauss in a heated debate with Jean-Paul Sartre over the nature of human freedom. On the one hand, Sartre's existentialist philosophy committed him to a position that human beings fundamentally were free to act as they pleased. On the other hand, Sartre also was a leftist who was committed to ideas such as that individuals were constrained by the ideologies imposed on them by the powerful. Lévi-Strauss presented his structuralist notion of agency in opposition to Sartre. Echoes of this debate between structuralism and existentialism would eventually inspire the work of younger authors such as Pierre Bourdieu.
Now a worldwide celebrity, Lévi-Strauss spent the second half of the 1960s working on his master project, a four-volume study called "Mythologiques". In it, he followed a single myth from the tip of South America and all of its variations from group to group up through Central America and eventually into the Arctic Circle, thus tracing the myth's cultural evolution from one end of the Western hemisphere to the other. He accomplished this in a typically structuralist way, examining the underlying structure of relationships among the elements of the story rather than by focusing on the content of the story itself. While "Pensée Sauvage" was a statement of Lévi-Strauss's big-picture theory, "Mythologiques" was an extended, four-volume example of analysis. Richly detailed and extremely long, it is less widely read than the much shorter and more accessible "Pensée Sauvage", despite its position as Lévi-Strauss's masterwork.
Lévi-Strauss completed the final volume of "Mythologiques" in 1971. On 14 May 1973 he was elected to the Académie française, France's highest honour for an intellectual. He was a member of other notable academies worldwide, including the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He received the Erasmus Prize in 1973, the Meister-Eckhart-Prize for philosophy in 2003, and several honorary doctorates from universities such as Oxford, Harvard, Yale and Columbia. He also was the recipient of the Grand-croix de la Légion d'honneur, was a Commandeur de l'ordre national du Mérite, and Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres. In 2005 he received the XVII Premi Internacional Catalunya (Generalitat of Catalonia). After his retirement, he continued to publish occasional meditations on art, music, and poetry.
Later life and death.
In 2008 he became the first member of the Académie française to reach the age of 100 and one of the few living authors to have his works published in the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade. On the death of Maurice Druon on 14 April 2009, he became the Dean of the "Académie", its longest-serving member.
He died on 30 October 2009, a few weeks before his 101st birthday. The death was announced four days later. French President Nicolas Sarkozy described him as "one of the greatest ethnologists of all time". Bernard Kouchner, the French Foreign Minister, said Lévi-Strauss "broke with an ethnocentric vision of history and humanity [...] At a time when we are trying to give meaning to globalisation, to build a fairer and more humane world, I would like Claude Lévi-Strauss's universal echo to resonate more strongly". "The Daily Telegraph" said in its obituary that Lévi-Strauss was "one of the dominating postwar influences in French intellectual life and the leading exponent of Structuralism in the social sciences". Permanent secretary of the Académie française Hélène Carrère d'Encausse said: "He was a thinker, a philosopher [...] We will not find another like him".
Theories.
Summary.
Lévi-Strauss sought to apply the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure to anthropology. At the time, the family was traditionally considered the fundamental object of analysis, but was seen primarily as a self-contained unit consisting of a husband, a wife, and their children. Nephews, cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents all were treated as secondary. Lévi-Strauss argued that, however, akin to Saussure's notion of linguistic value, families acquire determinate identities only through relations with one another. Thus he inverted the classical view of anthropology, putting the secondary family members first and insisting on analyzing the relations between units instead of the units themselves.
In his own analysis of the formation of the identities that arise through marriages between tribes, Lévi-Strauss noted that the relation between the uncle and the nephew was to the relation between brother and sister, as the relation between father and son is to that between husband and wife, that is, A is to B as C is to D. Therefore if we know A, B, and C, we can predict D, just as if we know A and D, we can predict B and C. The goal of Lévi-Strauss's structural anthropology, then, was to simplify the masses of empirical data into generalized, comprehensible relations between units, which allow for predictive laws to be identified, such as A is to B as C is to D.
Similarly, Lévi-Strauss identified myths as a type of speech through which a language could be discovered. His work is a structuralist theory of mythology which attempted to explain how seemingly fantastical and arbitrary tales, could be so similar across cultures. Because he believed there was not one "authentic" version of a myth, rather that they were all manifestations of the same language, he sought to find the fundamental units of myth, namely, the mytheme. Lévi-Strauss broke each of the versions of a myth down into a series of sentences, consisting of a relation between a function and a subject. Sentences with the same function were given the same number and bundled together. These are mythemes.
What Lévi-Strauss believed he had discovered when he examined the relations between mythemes was that a myth consists of juxtaposed binary oppositions. Oedipus, for example, consists of the overrating of blood relations and the underrating of blood relations, the autochthonous origin of humans and the denial of their autochthonous origin. Influenced by Hegel, Lévi-Strauss believed that the human mind thinks fundamentally in these binary oppositions and their unification (the thesis, antithesis, synthesis triad), and that these are what make meaning possible. Furthermore, he considered the job of myth to be a sleight of hand, an association of an irreconcilable binary opposition with a reconcilable binary opposition, creating the illusion, or belief, that the former had been resolved.
Anthropological theories.
Lévi-Strauss's theories are set forth in "Structural Anthropology" (1958). Briefly, he considers culture a system of symbolic communication, to be investigated with methods that others have used more narrowly in the discussion of novels, political speeches, sports, and movies.
His reasoning makes best sense when contrasted against the background of an earlier generation's social theory. He wrote about this relationship for decades.
A preference for "functionalist" explanations dominated the social sciences from the turn of the twentieth century through the 1950s, which is to say that anthropologists and sociologists tried to state the purpose of a social act or institution. The existence of a thing was explained, if it fulfilled a function. The only strong alternative to that kind of analysis was historical explanation, accounting for the existence of a social fact by stating how it came to be.
The idea of social function developed in two different ways, however. The English anthropologist Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown, who had read and admired the work of the French sociologist Émile Durkheim, argued that the goal of anthropological research was to find the collective function, such as what a religious creed or a set of rules about marriage did for the social order as a whole. Behind this approach was an old idea, the view that civilization developed through a series of phases from the primitive to the modern, everywhere in the same manner. All of the activities in a given kind of society would partake of the same character; some sort of internal logic would cause one level of culture to evolve into the next. On this view, a society can easily be thought of as an organism, the parts functioning together as do the parts of a body.
In contrast, the more influential functionalism of Bronisław Malinowski described the satisfaction of individual needs, what a person derived by participating in a custom.
In the United States, where the shape of anthropology was set by the German-educated Franz Boas, the preference was for historical accounts. This approach had obvious problems, which Lévi-Strauss praises Boas for facing squarely.
Historical information seldom is available for non-literate cultures. The anthropologist fills in with comparisons to other cultures and is forced to rely on theories that have no evidential basis whatsoever, the old notion of universal stages of development or the claim that cultural resemblances are based on some unrecognized past contact between groups. Boas came to believe that no overall pattern in social development could be proven; for him, there was no single history, only histories.
There are three broad choices involved in the divergence of these schools–each had to decide what kind of evidence to use; whether to emphasize the particulars of a single culture or look for patterns underlying all societies; and what the source of any underlying patterns might be, the definition of a common humanity.
Social scientists in all traditions relied on cross-cultural studies. It always was necessary to supplement information about a society with information about others. So some idea of a common human nature was implicit in each approach.
The critical distinction, then, remained: does a social fact exist because it is functional for the social order, or because it is functional for the person? Do uniformities across cultures occur because of organizational needs that must be met everywhere, or because of the uniform needs of human personality?
For Lévi-Strauss, the choice was for the demands of the social order. He had no difficulty bringing out the inconsistencies and triviality of individualistic accounts. Malinowski said, for example, that magic beliefs come into being when people need to feel a sense of control over events when the outcome was uncertain. In the Trobriand Islands, he found the proof of this claim in the rites surrounding abortions and weaving skirts. But in the same tribes, there is no magic attached to making clay pots even though it is no more certain a business than weaving. So, the explanation is not consistent. Furthermore, these explanations tend to be used in an ad hoc, superficial way–one postulates a trait of personality when needed.
But the accepted way of discussing organizational function didn't work either. Different societies might have institutions that were similar in many obvious ways and yet, served different functions. Many tribal cultures divide the tribe into two groups and have elaborate rules about how the two groups may interact. But exactly what they may do–trade, intermarry–is different in different tribes; for that matter, so are the criteria for distinguishing the groups.
Nor will it do to say that dividing-in-two is a universal need of organizations, because there are a lot of tribes that thrive without it.
For Lévi-Strauss, the methods of linguistics became a model for all his earlier examinations of society. His analogies usually are from phonology (though also later from music, mathematics, chaos theory, cybernetics, and so on).
"A really scientific analysis must be real, simplifying, and explanatory," he says (in "Structural Anthropology"). Phonemic analysis reveals features that are real, in the sense that users of the language can recognize and respond to them. At the same time, a phoneme is an abstraction from language–not a sound, but a category of sound defined by the way it is distinguished from other categories through rules unique to the language. The entire sound-structure of a language may be generated from a relatively small number of rules.
In the study of the kinship systems that first concerned him, this ideal of explanation allowed a comprehensive organization of data that partly had been ordered by other researchers. The overall goal was to find out why family relations differed among various South American cultures. The father might have great authority over the son in one group, for example, with the relationship rigidly restricted by taboos. In another group, the mother's brother would have that kind of relationship with the son, while the father's relationship was relaxed and playful.
A number of partial patterns had been noted. Relations between the mother and father, for example, had some sort of reciprocity with those of father and son–if the mother had a dominant social status and was formal with the father, for example, then the father usually had close relations with the son. But these smaller patterns joined together in inconsistent ways.
One possible way of finding a master order was to rate all the positions in a kinship system along several dimensions. For example, the father was older than the son, the father produced the son, the father had the same sex as the son, and so on; the matrilineal uncle was older and of the same sex, but did not produce the son, and so on. An exhaustive collection of such observations might cause an overall pattern to emerge.
But for Lévi-Strauss, this kind of work was considered "analytical in appearance only." It results in a chart that is far more difficult to understand than the original data and is based on arbitrary abstractions (empirically, fathers are older than sons, but it is only the researcher who declares that this feature explains their relations). Furthermore, it doesn't explain anything. The explanation it offers is tautological–if age is crucial, then age explains a relationship. And it does not offer the possibility of inferring the origins of the structure.
A proper solution to the puzzle is to find a basic unit of kinship which can explain all the variations. It is a cluster of four roles–brother, sister, father, son. These are the roles that must be involved in any society that has an incest taboo requiring a man to obtain a wife from some man outside his own hereditary line. A brother may give away his sister, for example, whose son might reciprocate in the next generation by allowing his own sister to marry exogamously. The underlying demand is a continued circulation of women to keep various clans peacefully related.
Right or wrong, this solution displays the qualities of structural thinking. Even though Lévi-Strauss frequently speaks of treating culture as the product of the axioms and corollaries that underlie it, or the phonemic differences that constitute it, he is concerned with the objective data of field research. He notes that it is logically possible for a different atom of kinship structure to exist–sister, sister's brother, brother's wife, daughter–but there are no real-world examples of relationships that can be derived from that grouping. The trouble with this view has been shown by the Australian anthropologist Augustus Elkin, who insisted on the point that in a four class marriage system, the preferred marriage was with a classificatory mother' s brother's daughter and never with the true one. Lévi-Strauss's atom of kinship structure deals only with consanguineal kin. There is a big difference between the two situations, in that the kinship structure involving the classificatory kin relations allows for the building of a system which can bring together thousands of people. Lévi-Strauss's atom of kinship stops working once the true MoBrDa is missing. Lévi-Strauss also developed the concept of the house society to describe those societies where the domestic unit is more central for social organization than the descent group or lineage.
The purpose of structuralist explanation is to organize real data in the simplest effective way. All science, he says, is either structuralist or reductionist. In confronting such matters as the incest taboo, one is facing an objective limit of what the human mind has accepted so far. One could hypothesize some biological imperative underlying it, but so far as social order is concerned, the taboo has the effect of an irreducible fact. The social scientist can only work with the structures of human thought that arise from it.
And structural explanations can be tested and refuted. A mere analytic scheme that wishes causal relations into existence is not structuralist in this sense.
Lévi-Strauss's later works are more controversial, in part because they impinge on the subject matter of other scholars. He believed that modern life and all history was founded on the same categories and transformations that he had discovered in the Brazilian back country–"The Raw and the Cooked, From Honey to Ashes, The Naked Man" (to borrow some titles from the "Mythologiques"). For instance he compares anthropology to musical serialism and defends his "philosophical" approach. He also pointed out that the modern view of primitive cultures was simplistic in denying them a history. The categories of myth did not persist among them because nothing had happened–it was easy to find the evidence of defeat, migration, exile, repeated displacements of all the kinds known to recorded history. Instead, the mythic categories had encompassed these changes.
He argued for a view of human life as existing in two timelines simultaneously, the eventful one of history and the long cycles in which one set of fundamental mythic patterns dominates and then perhaps another. In this respect, his work resembles that of Fernand Braudel, the historian of the Mediterranean and 'la longue durée,' the cultural outlook and forms of social organization that persisted for centuries around that sea. He is right in that history is difficult to build up in non literate society, nevertheless, Jean Guiart's anthropological and José Garanger's archeological work in central Vanuatu, bringing to the fore the skeletons of former chiefs described in local myths, who had thus been living persons, shows that there can be some means of ascertaining the history of some groups which otherwise would be deemed a-historical. Another issue is the experience that the same person can tell one a myth highly charged in symbols, and some years later a sort of chronological history claiming to be the chronic of a descent line (from examples in the Loyalty islands and New Zealand), the two texts having in common that they each deal in topographical detail with the land-tenure claims of the said descent line (see Douglas Oliver on the Siwai in Bougainville). Lévi-Strauss would agree to these aspects be explained inside his seminar, but would never touch them on his own. The anthropological data content of the myths was not his problem. He was only interested with the formal aspects of each story, considered by him as the result of the workings of the collective unconscious of each group, which idea was taken from the linguists, but cannot be proved in any way although he was adamant about its existence and would never accept any discussion on this point.
The structuralist approach to myth.
Lévi-Strauss sees a basic paradox in the study of myth. On one hand, mythical stories are fantastic and unpredictable: the content of myth seems completely arbitrary. On the other hand, the myths of different cultures are surprisingly similar:
On the one hand it would seem that in the course of a myth anything is likely to happen. […] But on the other hand, this apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity between myths collected in widely different regions. Therefore the problem: If the content of myth is contingent arbitrary, how are we to explain the fact that myths throughout the world are so similar?
Lévi-Strauss proposed that universal laws must govern mythical thought and resolve this seeming paradox, producing similar myths in different cultures. Each myth may seem unique, but he proposed it is just one particular instance of a universal law of human thought. In studying myth, Lévi-Strauss tries "to reduce apparently arbitrary data to some kind of order, and to attain a level at which a kind of necessity becomes apparent, underlying the illusions of liberty".
According to Lévi-Strauss, "mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution". In other words, myths consist of:
For example, Lévi-Strauss thinks the trickster of many Native American mythologies acts as a "mediator". Lévi-Strauss's argument hinges on two facts about the Native American trickster:
Lévi-Strauss argues that the raven and coyote "mediate" the opposition between life and death. The relationship between agriculture and hunting is analogous to the opposition between life and death: agriculture is solely concerned with producing life (at least up until harvest time); hunting is concerned with producing death. Furthermore, the relationship between herbivores and beasts of prey is analogous to the relationship between agriculture and hunting: like agriculture, herbivores are concerned with plants; like hunting, beasts of prey are concerned with catching meat. Lévi-Strauss points out that the raven and coyote eat carrion and are therefore halfway between herbivores and beasts of prey: like beasts of prey, they eat meat; like herbivores, they don't catch their food. Thus, he argues, "we have a mediating structure of the following type":
By uniting herbivore traits with traits of beasts of prey, the raven and coyote somewhat reconcile herbivores and beasts of prey: in other words, they mediate the opposition between herbivores and beasts of prey. As we have seen, this opposition ultimately is analogous to the opposition between life and death. Therefore, the raven and coyote ultimately mediate the opposition between life and death. This, Lévi-Strauss believes, explains why the coyote and raven have a contradictory personality when they appear as the mythical trickster:
The trickster is a mediator. Since his mediating function occupies a position halfway between two polar terms, he must retain something of that duality—namely an ambiguous and equivocal character.
Because the raven and coyote reconcile profoundly opposed concepts (i.e., life and death), their own mythical personalities must reflect this duality or contradiction: in other words, they must have a contradictory, "tricky" personality.
This theory about the structure of myth helps support Lévi-Strauss's more basic theory about human thought. According to this more basic theory, universal laws govern "all" areas of human thought:
If it were possible to prove in this instance, too, that the apparent arbitrariness of the mind, its supposedly spontaneous flow of inspiration, and its seemingly uncontrolled inventiveness ruled by laws operating at a deeper level […] if the human mind appears determined even in the realm of mythology, "a fortiori" it must also be determined in all its spheres of activity.
Out of all the products of culture, myths seem the most fantastic and unpredictable. Therefore, Lévi-Strauss claims, if even mythical thought obeys universal laws, then "all" human thought must obey universal laws.
"The Savage Mind": Bricoleur and Engineer.
Lévi-Strauss developed the comparison of the Bricoleur and Engineer in "The Savage Mind". "Bricoleur" has its origin in the old French verb "bricoler", which originally referred to extraneous movements in ball games, billiards, hunting, shooting and riding, but which today means do-it-yourself building or repairing things with the tools and materials on hand, puttering or tinkering as it were. In comparison to the true craftsman, whom Lévi-Strauss calls the Engineer, the Bricoleur is adept at many tasks and at putting preexisting things together in new ways, adapting his project to a finite stock of materials and tools. The Engineer deals with projects in their entirety, conceiving and procuring all the necessary materials and tools to suit his project. The Bricoleur approximates "the savage mind" and the Engineer approximates the scientific mind. Lévi-Strauss says that the universe of the Bricoleur is closed, and he often is forced to make do with whatever is at hand, whereas the universe of the Engineer is open in that he is able to create new tools and materials. But both live within a restrictive reality, and so the Engineer is forced to consider the preexisting set of theoretical and practical knowledge, of technical means, in a similar way to the Bricoleur.
Criticism.
Lévi-Strauss's theory on the origin of the Trickster has been criticized on a number of points by anthropologists. Stanley Diamond notes that while the secular civilized often consider the concepts of life and death to be polar, primitive cultures often see them "as aspects of a single condition, the condition of existence." Diamond remarks that Lévi-Strauss did not reach such a conclusion by inductive reasoning, but simply by working backwards from the evidence to the ""a priori" mediated concepts" of "life" and "death", which he reached by assumption of a necessary progression from "life" to "agriculture" to "herbivorous animals", and from "death" to "warfare" to "beasts of prey". For that matter, the coyote is well known to hunt in addition to scavenging and the raven also has been known to act as a bird of prey, in contrast to Lévi-Strauss's conception. Nor does that conception explain why a scavenger such as a bear would never appear as the Trickster. Diamond further remarks that "the Trickster names 'raven' and 'coyote' which Lévi-Strauss explains can be arrived at with greater economy on the basis of, let us say, the cleverness of the animals involved, their ubiquity, elusiveness, capacity to make mischief, their undomesticated reflection of certain human traits." Finally, Lévi-Strauss's analysis does not appear to be capable of explaining why representations of the Trickster in other areas of the world make use of such animals as the spider and mantis.
Ironically, the criticism of playing the trickster was leveled by some at Lévi-Strauss himself, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Edmund Leach noted that: "The outstanding characteristic of his writing, whether in French or English, is that it is difficult to understand; his sociological theories combine baffling complexity with overwhelming erudition. Some readers even suspect that they are being treated to a confidence trick".
Similarly, sociologist Stanislav Andreski criticized Lévi-Strauss's work generally, arguing that his scholarship was often sloppy and moreover that much of his mystique and reputation stemmed from his "threatening people with mathematics," a reference to Lévi-Strauss's use of quasi-algebraic equations to explain his ideas.
Commentary on contemporary human culture.
The following translated statement by Claude Lévi-Strauss was broadcast on National Public Radio in the remembrance produced by All Things Considered on November 3, 2009: 
"There is today a frightful disappearance of living species, be they plants or animals. And it's clear that the density of human beings has become so great, if I can say so, that they have begun to poison themselves. And the world in which I am finishing my existence is no longer a world that I like".

Concepción, Santa Cruz

"This article is about the Bolivian town. For other towns/cities named Concepción, see Concepción (disambiguation)."
Concepción is a town in the lowlands of Eastern Bolivia. It is known as part of the "Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos", declared in 1990 a World Heritage Site, as a former Jesuit Reduction.
Location.
Concepción is the capital of Ñuflo de Chávez Province in the Santa Cruz Department and is located at an elevation of 500 m above sea level, circa 250 kilometers northeast of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the department's capital.
History.
Concepción was founded in 1699 by Jesuits and served as a mission place for the Christianization of the Guaraní people. In 1722 the village moved to its present place, and in 1745 it was inhabited by circa 2,000 people of the "Punasicas, Boococas, Tubasicas, Paicones, Puyzocas, Quimonecas, Quitemos, Napecas, Paunacas" and "Tapacuracas" tribes.
Between 1753 and 1756 the cathedral of Concepción was built (see photo), which still is the center of the blooming town. In 1766, Concepción was inhabited by 713 families and 3,276 persons. When in 1767 Charles III expelled the Jesuits and the village was administered by secular authorities, many of its inhabitants fled to the woods. 
During the decade that followed the population decreased drastically, caused by epidemics, famine, the mismanagement of the new clergy and - at the end of the 19th century - by deporting the indigenous population to the rubber plantations.
Infrastructure.
Concepción has a gravel airfield of 1,900 m length (Airport-Code CEP).
Population.
The town's population has increased strongly in the past decades:
Climate.
The climate in the Concepción area is typical of the Bolivian lowlands east of the Andes, and weather data from Concepción is used to illustrate the weather and climate of the region. The table at shows the average weather conditions at Concepción. (Note that BBC misspells Concepción with a t: Conceptión).
Also the Lonely Planet's Bolivia guide, 6th Edition / April 2007, uses weather data from Concepción in a climate chart (page 368).

Morris Beckman (writer)

Morris Beckman (born 21 February 1921) is an English writer. To date he has had five books published.
Biography.
Early life.
Morris Beckman was born in the north-eastern London Borough of Hackney. He attended Hackney Downs School. In 1939, when World War II started, he tried to enlist in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot, but was turned down and signed up for the Merchant Navy as a radio officer.
Merchant Navy.
After three months training to become a radio officer, studying Morse code, Beckman was assigned to merchant vessels participating in the Battle of the Atlantic until 1942 and was torpedoed twice. He was posted to Bombay in 1942 and spent two years with the Mogul Line, crewing auxiliary vessels for the Royal Indian Navy across the Bay of Bengal, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.
Beckman’s vessels landed troops at Port Augusta during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 and, three months later, at Taranto during the Allied invasion of Italy. In 1944 his ship was attacked by the Luftwaffe en route to Alexandria, lost a propeller and was towed to Port Sudan. He caught paratyphoid, convalesced in Karachi, then worked his passage back home via Durban and New York.
By 1946 he was permanently onshore back in London and helped to found the 43 Group.
Career.
Beckman tried his hand at several businesses and eventually went into partnership with John David Gold to start a men’s clothes manufacturer, opening their first factory in Crawley in 1952. The firm steadily expanded, at one time having several factories in the UK and one in Malta. In 1975, faced with increasingly cheap imports from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, the company went into liquidation. Beckman started further small-scale businesses in the same industry, eventually giving up work for writing in the 1980s.
Writing.
While working for the Mogul Line, Beckman wrote many articles and short stories which were published in the "Sind Gazette" and "Egyptian Mail" amongst other newspapers. His first and only novel, "Open Skies and Lost Cargoes", was published by Thacker & Co in Bombay in 1944. Beckman wrote little after leaving the Merchant Navy until the 1980s when he began to document his experiences growing up in Hackney, serving in the Merchant Navy and fighting British fascist groups with the 43 Group. Since "The 43 Group" was published, Beckman has lectured in Britain, Germany, Holland and Ireland to groups interested in the fight against fascism. Subsequent autobiographical works are "The Hackney Crucible" about growing up in Hackney before World War II, and "Atlantic Roulette" about the Battle of the Atlantic. Beckman also wrote "The Jewish Brigade: An Army With Two Masters" about the Jewish Brigade.

Zhuangzi (book)

The Zhuangzi () is an ancient Chinese work from the late Warring States period (3rd century BC) which contains stories and anecdotes that exemplify the carefree nature of the ideal Daoist sage. Named for its traditional author, "Master Zhuang" (Zhuangzi), the "Zhuangzi" is one of the two foundational texts of Daoism, along with the "Laozi (Dao De Jing)".
The "Zhuangzi" is composed of a large collection of anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables, which are often humorous or irreverent in nature. Its main themes are of spontaneity in action and of freedom from the human world and its conventions. The fables and anecdotes in the text attempt to illustrate the falseness of human distinctions between good and bad, large and small, life and death, and human and nature. While other philosophers wrote of moral and personal duty, Zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with "the Way" ("Dào" 道) by following nature.
Though primarily known as a philosophical work, the "Zhuangzi" is regarded as one of the greatest literary works in all of Chinese history, and has been called "the most important pre-Qin text for the study of Chinese literature." A masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers for more than 2000 years from the Han dynasty to the present. Virtually every major Chinese writer and poet in history, from Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties, Li Bai during the Tang dynasty, to Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty were familiar with and deeply influenced by the "Zhuangzi".
History.
The "Zhuangzi" is named for and attributed to Zhuang Zhou – "Master Zhuang" (Chinese: "Zhuangzi" 莊子) – a man who was born around 369 BC in the state of Song, near the borders of modern Henan and Shandong provinces, and died around 286 BC. Almost nothing is concretely known of Zhuangzi's life. He is thought to have spent time in the southern state of Chu, as well as in Linzi, the capital of the state of Qi. Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian", written around 104 BC, has a biography of Zhuangzi, but most of it seems to be drawn from anecdotes in the "Zhuangzi" itself. Burton Watson has noted, "Whoever Zhuang Zhou was, the writings attributed to him bear the stamp of a brilliant and original mind."
Even though the text is generally treated as a single whole, scholars have recognized since the Song dynasty that some parts of the book could not have been written by Zhuangzi himself. It is generally accepted that the middle and later "Zhuangzi" chapters are the result of a subsequent process of accretion and redaction by later authors responding "to the scintillating brilliance" of the inner chapters.
Since ancient times the first 7 chapters (the "nèi piān" 內篇 "inner chapters") have been considered to be the actual work of Zhuangzi, and most modern scholars agree with this view. The "Records of the Grand Historian" refers to a 100,000-word "Zhuangzi" work and references several chapters that are still in the text. The "Book of Han", finished in AD 111, lists a "Zhuangzi" in 52 chapters, which many scholars believe to be the original form of the work. A number of different forms of the "Zhuangzi" survived into the Tang dynasty, but a shorter and more popular 33-chapter form of the book prepared by Guo Xiang around AD 300 is the source of all surviving editions. In 742, an imperial proclamation from Emperor Xuanzong of Tang awarded the "Zhuangzi" the honorific title "True Scripture of Southern Florescence" ("Nanhua zhenjing" 南華真經), a name still used in certain formal contexts.
Manuscripts.
A large number of "Zhuangzi" fragments dating from the early Tang dynasty were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century. They collectively form about twelve chapters of Guo Xiang's version of the "Zhuangzi", and are preserved mostly at the British Library and the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Among the Japanese national treasures preserved in the Kōzan-ji temple in Kyoto is a "Zhuangzi" manuscript from the Muromachi period. The manuscript has seven complete chapters from the "outer" and "miscellaneous" chapters, and is believed to be a close copy of an annotated edition written in the 7th century by Daoist master Cheng Xuanying (成玄英; fl. AD 630–660).
Content.
Almost all of the 33 surviving "Zhuangzi" chapters contain fables and allegories. Most "Zhuangzi" stories are fairly short and simple, such as "Lickety" and "Split" drilling seven holes in "Wonton" (chapter 7) or Zhuangzi being discovered sitting and beating on a basin after his wife dies (chapter 18), although a few are longer and more complex, like the story of Master Lie and the magus (chapter 14) and the account of the Yellow Emperor's music (chapter 14). Unlike the other stories and allegories in other pre-Qin texts, the "Zhuangzi" is unique in that the allegories form the bulk of the text, rather than occasional features, and are always witty, emotional, and are not limited to reality.
Unlike other ancient Chinese works, whose allegories were usually based on historical legends and proverbs, most "Zhuangzi" stories seem to have been invented by Zhuangzi himself. Some are completely whimsical, such as the strange description of evolution from "misty spray" through a series of substances and insects to horses and humans (chapter 18), while a few other passages seem to be sheer playful nonsense which read like Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky". The "Zhuangzi" is full of quirky and fantastic characters, such as "Mad Stammerer", "Fancypants Scholar", "Sir Plow", and a man who believes his left arm will turn into a rooster, his right arm will turn into a crossbow, and his buttocks will become cartwheels.
A master of language, Zhuangzi sometimes engages in logic and reasoning, but then turns it upside down or carries the arguments to absurdity to demonstrate the limitations of human knowledge and the rational world. Some of Zhuangzi's reasoning, like his famous argument with his philosopher friend Hui Shi – "Master Hui" ("Huizi" 惠子) – about the joy of fish (chapter 17), have been compared to the Socratic and Platonic dialogue traditions, and Huizi's paradoxes near the end of the book have been termed "strikingly like those of Zeno of Elea."
"The Butterfly Dream".
The most famous of all "Zhuangzi" stories – "Zhuang Zhou Dreams of Being a Butterfly" ("Zhuāng Zhōu mèng dié" 莊周夢蝶) – appears at the end of the second chapter, "On the Equality of Things".
The striking image of Zhuangzi wondering if he was a man who dreamt of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a man is so famous that whole dramas have been written on its theme. In it Zhuangzi "with the theme of transformation", illustrating that "the distinction between waking and dreaming is another false dichotomy. If [one distinguishes them, how can tell if [one is now dreaming or awake?"
"The Death of Wonton".
Another famous "Zhuangzi" story – "The Death of Wonton" ("Hùndùn zhī sǐ" 渾沌之死) – illustrates the dangers Zhuangzi saw in going against the innate nature of things.
Zhuangzi believed that the greatest of all human happiness could be achieved through a higher understanding of the nature of things, and that in order to develop oneself fully one needed to express one's innate ability. In this anecdote, Zhuangzi humorously and absurdly uses "Wonton", a name for both primordial chaos and, by physical analogy, wonton soup, to demonstrate what he believed were the disastrous consequences of going against things' innate natures.
"Zhuangzi's Wife Dies".
Another well-known "Zhuangzi" story – "Zhuangzi's Wife Dies" ("Zhuāngzǐ qī sǐ" 莊子妻死) – describes how Zhuangzi did not view death as something to be feared.
Zhuangzi seems to have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of existence and assumes another. His writings teach that "the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness."
Themes.
The other major philosophical schools of ancient China, such as Confucianism, Legalism, and Mohism, were all concerned with concrete social, political, or ethical reforms designed to reform people and society and alleviate the problems and suffering of the world. However, Zhuangzi believed that the key to true happiness was to free oneself from the world and its standards through the Daoist principle of "inaction" ("wúwéi" 無為), action that is not based on any purposeful striving or motives for gain. In one instance, Zhuangzi has a man named "Rufus Southglory" ("Nánróng Chú" 南榮趎) visit Laozi, who asks him: "Why have you come with such a host of people accompanying you?" Southglory, who had come by himself, looked behind himself but saw no one, for Laozi actually meant the "host of people" to mean "the baggage of old ideas, the conventional concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, life and death, that he lugged about with him wherever he went.
In order to illustrate the mindlessness and spontaneity he felt should characterize human action, Zhuangzi most frequently uses the analogy of craftsmen or artisans. As Burton Watson writes, "the skilled woodcarver, the skilled butcher, the skilled swimmer does not ponder or ratiocinate on the course of action he should take; his skill has become so much a part of him that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously and, without knowing why, achieves success." The term "wandering" ("yóu" 遊) is used throughout the stories of the "Zhuangzi" to describe how an enlightened person "wanders through all of creation, enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it."
The "Zhuangzi" vigorously opposes formal government, which Zhuangzi seems to have felt was problematic at its foundation "because of the opposition between man and nature." The text tries to show that "as soon as government intervenes in natural affairs, it destroys all possibility of genuine happiness." It is unclear if Zhuangzi would have supported modern anarchism, as he did not support violence, and the political references in the "Zhuangzi" are more concerned with what government should not do rather than what kind of government should exist.
Western scholars have long noticed that the "Zhuangzi" is often strongly anti-rationalist. Mohism, deriving from Zhuangzi's possible contemporary Mozi, was the most logically sophisticated school in ancient China. Whereas reason and logic became the hallmark of Greek philosophy and then the entire Western philosophical tradition, in China philosophers preferred to rely on moral persuasion and intuition. The "Zhuangzi" played a significant role in the traditional Chinese skepticism toward rationalism, as Zhuangzi frequently turns logical arguments upside-down to satirize and discredit them. However, Zhuangzi did not entirely abandon language and reason, but "only wished to point out that overdependence on them could limit the flexibility of thought."
Influence.
The "Zhuangzi" is one of the most influential works in the history of Chinese literature. Jia Yi, in his 170 BC work ""Fu" on the Owl", the earliest definitively known "fu" rhapsody, sought consolation in Zhuangzi's words, which he does not reference by name but cites for one-sixth of the poem. Virtually every major Chinese writer or poet in history, from Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties, Li Bai during the Tang dynasty, to Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty were "deeply imbued with the ideas and artistry of the "Zhuangzi"." Several explicitly stated their admiration of the "Zhuangzi", such as in Ruan Ji's essay "Discourse on Summing Up the "Zhuangzi"" ("Dá Zhuāng lùn" 達莊論), Wang Anshi's essay "Discourse on the "Zhuangzi"" ("Zhuāngzǐ lùn" 莊子論), and Su Shi's essay "A Record of the Memorial Shrine of Master Zhuang" ("Zhuāngzǐ cítáng jì" 莊子祠堂記).
Outside of China, however, the "Zhuangzi" lags far behind the "Dao De Jing" in general popularity, and is rarely known by non-scholars. In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the "Zhuangzi", famed sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote: "I feel a sense of injustice that the "Dao De Jing" is so well known to my fellow citizens while the "Zhuangzi" is so thoroughly ignored, because I firmly believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work."

Zebra caterpillar

The zebra caterpillar is the larva of an American noctuid moth ("Melanchra picta" or "Ceramica picta") that feeds on cabbages, beets and other cultivated plants.
The head, thorax and forewings of adults are chestnut- or reddish-brown, usually with purplish brown mottling on the wings. The whitish hind wings have pale brown margins. The abdomen is light gray. The wingspan is 35 to 40 mm (about 1-1/2 inches).
The newly hatched larvae are whitish, marked by dark heads and several dark spots scattered over the body. The more mature caterpillars vary in color, often displaying bright and conspicuous hues, usually with prominent black and light yellow longitudinal stripes. The top stripe is black, the top-lateral stripe and the stripe below the spiracles are cream to bright yellow, and the spiracle stripe and bottom stripe are black and marked with numerous white lines and spots. The mid-dorsal line is pale and may be well developed or absent. The underside and legs are light red-brown or yellow. The head is reddish or reddish-brown and without dark arcs or reticulations. Larvae are 35 to 40 mm long when mature.
The larvae first feed in small compact groups until molting, after which they scatter throughout the foliage. They feed during the day. When disturbed on foliage, they roll up and fall to the ground.
Zebra caterpillars thrive throughout the United States. Known as general feeders in the western states, they usually become pests in late summer. This caterpillar often exists in a mixed population with the bertha armyworm and the variegated cutworm.

About Thulakot
Thulakot is in Kalika VDC of Kaski and falls in the Royal Trek region of Pokhara. Royal Trek was named after Prince Charles of United Kingdom who had trekked in this region 30 years ago. From this region one could see the mountain range and eight lakes out of nine lakes of Pokhara. From here The Annapurna Range, Machhapuchchhre Range, Dhaulagiri and Manasulu’s mountain peaks could be seen. Fewa lake and Kamal Lake of Pokhara and Begnas, Maidi, Dipang, Gude, Nureni and Khaste Lakes of Lekhnath could be seen from this region though apart from Fewa and Begnas, other lakes don’t look like a lake today. Many villages of the hilly region like Khilang, Siklesh and villages of Lamjung could also be seen from this region. Thulakot also carries a historic importance as it was one of the kingdom of Chubise (twenty four) kingdom of Kaski.There are only few hotels in this region and Annapurna Skyline cottage is one of them. It is the only cottage that is situated in the hilltop of Thulakot and has got four rooms with around twelve beds. The rates of the hotels over here are reasonable as there is no difficulty in the transportation of goods. One should look for a good weather before coming to this place as this place would look heavenly when you see the mountains so close that you might think you could reach there in a day.

Pat Devlin (American football)

Patrick Ryan "Pat" Devlin (born April 12, 1988) is an American football quarterback for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League. He was signed by the Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He started at quarterback for the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens of the University of Delaware. He was recruited to play for the Penn State Nittany Lions out of Downingtown East High School. Having set the Pennsylvania high school career passing yards record with 8,162 career yards, Devlin was a highly touted recruit. Devlin played two seasons at Penn State before deciding to transfer to Delaware.
College career.
Penn State.
2007.
After redshirting the 2006 season, Devlin was listed as the third-string quarterback behind Anthony Morelli and Daryll Clark in 2007. Devlin saw action in games against Florida International, Wisconsin, and Temple, but accumulated few statistics.
2008.
In the weeks leading up to the start of the 2008 season, controversy swirled around the Nittany Lions' starting quarterback position. Daryll Clark, the more experienced and agile quarterback was being weighed against the younger, more prolific passing threat in Devlin. In the end, Penn State coach Joe Paterno chose to start Daryll Clark while having him split as much time with Devlin as would be possible. Lopsided victories in the first four games of the 2008 season provided Devlin with much playing time. In games against Coastal Carolina, Oregon State, Syracuse, and Temple, Devlin threw for 260 yards and was 18 of 35. When Clark was forced out in the fourth quarter of the Nittany Lions' crucial game versus Ohio State due to a concussion, Devlin led the team on a go-ahead drive that was culminated by his own 1-yard touchdown run. He also had some playing time against Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Michigan State. Devlin appeared in ten games for the Nittany Lions, passing for 459 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions.
Devlin decided to transfer from Penn State prior to the 2009 Rose Bowl.
Delaware.
2009.
Devlin led the 2009 squad to a 6–5 record. Devlin started all eleven games for the Blue Hens, passing for 2,664 yards, sixteen touchdowns, and nine interceptions. In the final game of the season against Villanova University, Devlin passed for Delaware school records in completions (42) and attempts (58) and threw for 407 yards. Devlin was named the Colonial Athletic Association Football Offensive Player of the Week twice during the season, and led the league in passing average per game (242.2 yards) and total offense per game (253.7 yards). He also was honored as the Eastern College Athletic Conference Division I – Championship Subdivision Offensive Player of the Week.
The Sports Network wrote that "Devlin has put some teeth back into the Blue Hen passing attack with his accurate throws and on-field leadership", and included him as a finalist in the voting for the 2009 Walter Payton Award, given to the most outstanding offensive player in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA). In November 2009, Devlin was honored as the local College Player of the Year by the Eagles Fly for Leukemia program, an organization supporting pediatric cancer and leukemia research in the Delaware Valley.
2010.
In June, Devlin was selected to the Consensus Draft Services Pre-Season NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision pre-season honorable mention All-American. The team is made up of players at the FCS level who the CDS staff predicts will be among the top players in the nation and have a chance to be selected in the National Football League Draft in April 2011. In July, Devlin was placed on the watchlists for the Walter Payton Award and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award.
In the season's first game against West Chester, Devlin completed 14 of 23 passes for 163 yards with three touchdown passes to lead the team to a 31-0 shutout. Although Devlin fractured a bone in his non-throwing wrist in the first quarter of the game against South Dakota State, he played through the middle of the fourth quarter. Although cleared to play the following week against Duquesne, Devlin stood on the sidelines. Devlin came back the following week with a big second-half win against Richmond, but was knocked out of the following week's game against James Madison with a concussion. Back at home against Maine, Devlin completed 20 of 36 passes for 286 yards, leading the Blue Hens to their sixth win of the season. After a close win against Rhode Island and a one-point loss against William & Mary, he dominated against Towson, completing 29 of 38 passes for 318 yards and one touchdown while running for another score. Devlin became the ninth Delaware player to pass for over 4,000 yards in a career.
Professional career.
NFL Draft.
Devlin entered the 2011 NFL Draft and was regarded as one of the top ten quarterbacks entering the draft by NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock, but was not drafted. He was targeted as the first overall pick in the 2011 UFL Draft, but declined to sign a mandatory contract.

Naval Mobile Construction Battalion One

Naval Mobile Construction Battalion ONE (NMCB 1), is a United States Navy Seabee battalion. NMCB 1 has a long, proud and distinguished history that reaches back to the early days of World War II.
History.
Commissioned on March 15, 1942 as Naval Construction Battalion One (NCB), the Battalion was soon split into two detachments and sent into service in the South Pacific.
World War II through Vietnam.
NMCB One operated in the South Pacific for 23 months, mostly in the vicinity of the Tonga and Samoan Islands. During this time, various detachments built runways, base facilities, gun emplacements, fuel and oil storage tank farms as well as various other projects. With operations in the South Pacific drawing to a close, the Battalion was sent home and decommissioned in June 1944.
In 1949, the Navy began an intense reorganization that included the creation of a new type of construction unit – the Mobile Construction Battalion. On August 8, 1949, U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion One was established at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia and was formally commissioned on October 28 of that same year.
Homeport changed for the Battalion in 1951 when it moved from Little Creek to Davisville, Rhode Island. During the ensuing years, the Battalion served at Puerto Rico; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Bermuda; Port Lyautey, French Morocco; Argentia, Newfoundland; and Rota, Spain. In 1956, the Battalion went to Antarctica and participated in Operation Deep Freeze II. During this time, NMCB One with its detachments was simultaneously employed on six continents. NMCB One returned to Antarctica in 1961, this time to assemble a nuclear power plant and work on 17 projects for which the Battalion received the Navy Unit Commendation.
NMCB One was the first Atlantic Fleet Battalion to take part in the Vietnam War. From 1966 to 1970, the Battalion made four consecutive deployments to Vietnam. During this time, four NMCB One members made the ultimate sacrifice serving their country. Their names were Constructionman Starkey, Steelworker 3rd Class Williams, Chief Builder McGinn, and Lieutenant Junior Grade Moscrip.
1970s through present.
Fall 1971 thru spring early summer 1972,MCB 1 one was the second Battalion to occupy and construct the BOIT station on Diego Garcia. They relieved MCB 40, who had landed, 9 months earlier, on the island by LSD'S and LST'S. THEY CONSTRUCTED THE FACILITIES THAT MCB 1 WOULD COMPLETE OVER THEIR 9 MONTH DEPLOYMENT. The runway, MCB ONE 's advanced party landed on, in C130's was 3000 feet long. When MCB ONE left the island the runway was 11,500 feet long and at final grade and compaction for the incoming MCB 62 to pour the 50 foot wide , 12 inch deep and 11,500 foot long final concrete runway. MCB ONE also constructed the concrete silo's for the cement , that came in by ship, to pour the runway. MCB ONE also finished the aggregate piles by blasting the coral reef and mining the rock, crushing it and stock piling it for 62's use.The pile when we left was over 500 foot tall, making it the mountain on the island, who's avg. elevation was 6 1/2 feet above sea level when we got there. The commanding officer for 1 then was P. Oliver JR. and the XO was Comdr.. Perez. The main camp, CAMP Cushman, was named after the sailor who was standing watch at the water desalt barge when the steel plate cracked and dumped water on the red hot heater turning it into steam. Seaman Cushman was severely burned by the steam,and was air lifted out by british pilots at great risk.THE CAMP WAS NAMED FOR HIM posthumously .
In 1974 NMCB One was the last Battalion to deploy from Davisville. When the Battalion returned from Rota, it settled down in its new home at the Naval Construction Battalion Center (Gulfport, Mississippi).
NMCB One sent two details in 1990 to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The following year, the Battalion provided disaster relief following super typhoons on Guam and American Samoa. Upon returning to homeport in May 1992, the Battalion was again providing disaster relief, this time in South Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. In December 1992, NMCB One redeployed from Rota to Somalia to conduct construction in support of Operation Restore Hope.
A 180-person detachment from NMCB One deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina in December 1997 to support Operation Joint Guard. NMCB One returned to the Balkans when a 97-person detachment deployed to Kosovo in December 1999 as part of Task Force Falcon. During their 2000 European deployment, Detail Souda Bay conducted disaster recovery operations in remote Crete villages following torrential rains.
In June 2002, the Battalion deployed to Okinawa, Japan for the first time since 1987, where it performed various peacetime construction operations across the Pacific. Upon arriving in Okinawa, the Battalion immediately redeployed a 102-person Air Detachment to Basilan Island, Republic of the Philippines, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Under hostile conditions, the Air Det improved roads, drilled water wells, built bridges and base camps and rebuilt a dilapidated timber pier.
During its 2003–2004 Pacific Deployment, “The First and The Finest” made history by being the first NMCB to have deployed to two main-body deployment sites in Rota, Spain and on Guam. NMCB One performed peacetime construction operations in the Atlantic, European, Pacific and Central Command Areas of Responsibility, while simultaneously deploying its Air Det to Iraq in support of Iraqi Freedom. In September 2004, NMCB One performed disaster recovery operations at NAS Pensacola following Hurricane Ivan.
For its 2005 European deployment NMCB One and its details served in twelve countries throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, and once again deployed its Air Det to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Immediately upon returning to homeport in August 2005, the Battalion commenced substantial disaster recovery operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
In June 2006, NMCB One deployed to 20 sites in 9 countries as part of their Pacific deployment. The Battalion performed peacetime construction operations in Okinawa, Atsugi, Sasebo, Yokosuka, Iwakuni, Fuji, Chinhae, Pohang, Diego Garcia, Camp Pendleton, and San Clemente Island, contingency operations in Pohnpei, Indonesia, Philippines, and Afghanistan, and prison detainee operations in Iraq.
In September 2007, following a successful homeport, the Battalion deployed to 16 different sites throughout CENTCOM, PACOM, and NORTHCOM. NMCB One provided contingency construction and engineering in support of both Operation Iraqi Freedom II and Operation Enduring Freedom, in Iraq and Afghanistan. While supporting the mission in CENTCOM, the Battalion also conducted peacetime construction operations in Guam and San Nicolas Island (SNI), CA. Notably, the 120 Seabees in Guam and SNI redeployed to join the rest of the Battalion in support of the CENTCOM missions midway through deployment.

Peter Heehs

Peter Heehs is an American historian living in Puducherry, India who writes on modern Indian history, spirituality and religion. Much of his work focuses on the Indian freedom fighter and spiritual leader Sri Aurobindo. His publications include eleven books and more than fifty articles in journals and magazines.
Peter Heehs was born and educated in the United States but has lived in India since 1971. He has worked as a researcher and editor at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Archives since its founding, and has contributed to the editing of the "Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library" and "The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo".
As a historian, Heehs has written on the swadeshi period of the Indian independence movement and on the early phase of the Indian revolutionary movement. His 1992 study "The Bomb in Bengal" highlighted the importance of the Maniktala secret society, which was a predecessor of the Jugantar Group. In this book and other publications, Heehs made it clear that the Indian freedom struggle had a violent as well as a non-violent side, and that the violent revolutionaries helped prepare the country psychologically for the later mass movements led by Mahatma Gandhi. In the second edition of "The Bomb in Bengal" (2004), Heehs distinguished the aims and methods of early Indian revolutionaries from those of later terrorists in India and elsewhere.
Heehs has also written on problems of Indian historiography in "History and Theory", "Postcolonial Studies", and other journals. He has also contributed to popular magazines such as "History Today".
As a scholar of religion, Heehs has edited the textbook "Indian Religions" and has contributed to journals and edited volumes dealing with new religious movements in India. He has also discussed the problems of Indian communalism.
Heehs's ninth book, "The Lives of Sri Aurobindo" (Columbia University Press, 2008) was intended for scholarly readers. It received positive reviews in the United States, but was objected to by devotees of Sri Aurobindo, who have delayed the publication of the book in India. Heehs's tenth book, "Writing the Self", was published by Bloomsbury in February 2013. It has been named an Outstanding Academic Title for 2013 by . His eleventh book, "Situating Sri Aurobindo: A Reader", a collection of essays by various scholars on Sri Aurobindo's writings, with an introduction, was published by Oxford University Press in October 2013. 
Heehs was briefly in the news in April 2012 after the Indian home ministry declined to entertain an application for extension of his resident visa after April 15. Learning of the affair on March 31, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said he would review Heehs’s case.

History.
The first station was opened in Zaandam on November 1, 1869. This was a station of the type SS Hoogezand. This building had a large middle section, with a ticket office, with the passageways to the platforms. At this middle piece were the 2 lower portions of the building. The facade had a big clock, there was also a freestanding building next to the station.
In 1983 the Hemtunnel opened, this closing the Hembrug. The station was completely rebuilt, with the distinctive red roof. The station has 2 island platforms at ground level.

Valam

Valam is a village as well as municipality, or Village Development Committee, in the Kaski District of the Gandaki Zone of northern-central Nepal.
Population.
At the time of the 1991 Nepal census Valam had a population of 3,658.
Literacy.
In 2001, 2300 people were literate, 1024 of them were male and 1276 were female. However, a total of 402 inhabitants could not read or write, including 39 males and 363 females.
Marital status.
According to the 1991 census 2118 people were identified as having a marital status.; 15 of these were identified as being married with more than one spouse Polygamy.
Education.
In 2001 there were 721 people in Valam eligible for attending school, but only 434 were actually attending schools (including
291 males and 143 females).
Structure.
Like in many other villages of Nepal, the Gurungs live in higher parts of the village (mainly Dadaghau and Bhathal), and the Brahmins and Kshtrees inhabit the lower regions of Valam Phant, Ralichaur and Khora. Some dalits live in both upper and lower parts.
Culture.
Although not generally known for its rich traditions, Valam has become known because of its Harirar Cave (Gupha), being a religious site for Hindu. Every year a fair (mela) is held by local youths at the occasion of the Holi (or Fagu Poornima) the 3-day festival of colors. Volleyball competitions will be held and dances will be performed, attracting Pokhara citizens by the thousands. Another large event is the annual athletic competition of the British Gurkha trainees each carrying 25 kg of weights to the highest point of the village.
Problems.
The village still lacks a number of facilities. There are only dirt roads that factually disappear during the monsoon season. As a result, during the monsoon there is no access to the market to sell goods, and no income can be generated during the monsoon from agriculture. As a consequence, large-scale migration to neighboring cities has taken place and even emigration to foreign countries, leaving the village almost empty.
