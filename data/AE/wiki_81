Masdevallia veitchiana

Masdevallia veitchiana, (pronounced "veech-e-anna") also known as Veitch's Masdevallia or King of the Masdevallias, is a species of the "Masdevallia" genus of orchids.
The plant is found in the wild in northwestern Peru, where it is known as "Gallo-Gallo", meaning "rooster" after the rooster-like red comb, crest and wattles of the flower. and Colombia. The plant was named in honour of Harry Veitch, of the Veitch Nurseries family, by whose plant-hunters it was discovered in 1867, and who imported, cultivated, and first flowered this species.
Long considered the national treasure of Peru, it is rumoured to have been cultivated by the Incas centuries ago, who called the plant "waqanki".
Description.
This cool to cold growing, large, terrestrial, sometimes lithophytic or rarely epiphytic, tufted species with erect leaves is found at a height of between 2,000 and 4,000 metres, including around Machu Picchu in Peru, on steep rocky slopes covered with grasses and shrubs in full sun but with the leaves protected by the grass with short ramicauls enveloped by a series of tubular bracts with a linear-oblanceolate, tapered to the channelled petiolate base, acute, thick leaf that blooms in the spring and early summer with an erect, 39 to 44 cm. long, single flowered inflorescence carrying two distant, tubular bracts and a single inflated tubular, ovate floral bract with the long-lasting flowers held way above the leaves. The unequal colour distribution apparent in "M. veitchiana" is accorded to the presence of minute purple hairs on the sepals which lend a prismatic visual aspect to the flower. Viewed head-on with the light behind you, the colour is symmetrical.
This species has orange flowers covered in a pattern of small purple hairs that create a kind of iridescence as the flower moves in the breezes. The blooms are very large, approximately 5 cm. X 15 cm.
Discovery.
According to "Hortus Veitchii":
"Masdevallia Veitchiana was discovered in the lofty Andes of Peru by Pearce in 1866, and successfully introduced by him. A few years later it was re-discovered in the same locality by Walter Davis, who states that it grows in the crevices and hollows of the rocks with but little soil, at an altitude of 11,000-13,000 ft.
It is a variable plant, the flowers differing in size, colour, and in the manner in which the papillae is spread over the inner surface of the sepals. A large-flowered form, grandiflora, may be distinguished by having the upper sepal densely and uniformly covered with purple papillae, while in the lateral two this covering is confined entirely to the outer half, the inner being of the purest orange-scarlet and destitute of papillae."
Cultivation.
"M. veitchiana" is an excellent plant for beginners and experienced growers alike. It grows quickly into a specimen plant and is quite spectacular when several flowers bloom together, usually between spring and summer. "M. veitchiana" prefers a cool, moist location but, like most orchids, requires good light to flower consistently. In poor light the flower stems tend to be weak, causing the flowers to droop. "M. veitchiana" prefers daytime temperatures from 15 to 25 degrees celsius and will tolerate evening low temperatures below 5 degrees. The plants will freeze, so care should be taken in times of severe frost or freezing temperatures.
Propagation.
Because of extensive collection in the wild, "M. veitchiana" is rarely imported. It is, however, propagated quite easily both from seed and by division. The plants grow very vigorously and have a rhizome from which the thick, narrow leaves develop. This rhizome can be divided to create new plants with clumps of at least five to ten leaves per division. "M. veitchiana" has also been used extensively to create many hybrids with its distinctive orange color.

Rani Mahal

The Rani Mahal is a royal palace in the city of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The palace was built by Raghu Nath-II of the Newalkar family (1769-96). This palace later formed one of the residences for Rani Lakshmibai. Architecturally, it is a flat-roofed, two-storeyed building having a quadrangular courtyard with a small well and one fountain on opposing sides. The palace consists of six halls and parallel corridors with multi-foiled arches and a number of small rooms. The Darbar Hall, approached by a flight of steps, is beautifully decorated with paintings in bright colours exhibiting various floral, faunal and geometrical motifs. The arches are embellished with peacock and rosette patterns. The majority of it was damaged by British bombardment during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The ground floor of the palace houses stone sculptures collected from Madanpur, Barua Sagar, Dudhai and Chandpur dating from the Gupta to Medieval periods (9th to 12th centuries).

Yelkanum Seclamatan

Yelkanum Seclamatan ( ; Nooksack: "Y’elʔqáy’nem Selh’émeten" ; died April 1911), also known as Chief Jim, Indian Jim, Lynden Jim, or Squahalish Jim, was chief of the Nooksack Indians in the late 19th century. His first name has variously been spelled "Yellakanim", "Yallakanum", or "Yellow Kanim", and his last name "Seklameten" or "Seclamatum".
Life.
In the late 1870s, Yelkanum contributed portions of his land to be used in the construction of a Nooksack Indian Methodist School by Clara and Rev. John Tennant (after whom Tennant Lake is named). In 1893 Tennant died of a stroke, and ten years later Yelkanum married his Lummi wife Clara Tennant. However, three months after their marriage Clara died of pneumonia.
Yelkanum's death was announced in "The Bellingham Herald" on April 27, 1911. At the time he lived with his granddaughter Emily Williams.

Rosalind (As You Like It)

Rosalind is a fictional character and the romantic female lead in the play "As You Like It" (1600) by William Shakespeare.
She is the beautiful daughter of the exiled Duke Senior and niece to his usurping brother Duke Frederick. Her father is banished from the kingdom which breaks her heart. She then meets Orlando and falls in love with him. After angering her uncle, she leaves his court for exile in the Forest of Arden. Disguised as a shepherd named Ganymede, Rosalind lives with her sweet and devoted cousin, Celia (who is disguised as Ganymede's sister, Aliena), and Duke Frederick's fool Touchstone. Eventually, Rosalind is reunited with her father and married to her faithful lover, Orlando.
Rosalind is one of Shakespeare's most recognized heroines. Admired for her intelligence, quick wit, and beauty, Rosalind is a vital character in "As You Like It." Most commonly seen next to her beloved cousin Celia, Rosalind is also a faithful friend, leader, and schemer. She stays true to her family and friends throughout the entire story, no matter how dangerous the consequences. Rosalind dominates the stage. Her true decision-making skills can be seen in the last scene of Act V (5) where she has to present herself as Rosalind to her father and to Orlando, but at the same time change Phebe's opinion to marry Silvius. She is the main character of the 
play who extracts the clarity of important traits in other characters.
Art and Stage Depictions.
Rosalind has been played by various notable actresses including Elizabeth Bergner in a 1936 film opposite Laurence Olivier as Orlando, Vanessa Redgrave rose to fame playing the part in 1960 with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Helena Bonham Carter in the 2000 BBC Radio 4 version, Helen Mirren in the 1978 BBC version of the play directed by Basil Coleman, and Bryce Dallas Howard in the 2006 production directed by Kenneth Branagh.
Acclaimed Tony Award-winning American actress Patti LuPone played the role at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, after her award-winning portrayal of Eva Peron in the original Broadway run of "Evita". This caused much speculation because LuPone was leaving the Broadway stage and moving to "regional" work.
Adrian Lester won a Time Out Award for his performance as Rosalind in Cheek by Jowl's 1991 production of "As You Like It". A male actor in the role (as would have been the norm in Shakespeare's time) underlines the confusion of gender roles within the play: at one point, a male actor is playing a woman who is pretending to be a man acting the part of a woman.
Source Of The Name.
Rosalynde is the heroine of Lodge's Euphues' Golden Legacy. 'Faire Rosalind' had, however,at this time, acquired a fresh poetic fame as the object of Spenser's attachment, celebrated in his Shephearde's Calendar, 1579, and Colin Clouts Come Home Againe, 1595. 'Of all the sweet feminine names compounded from Rosa, that of Rosa-linda seems to be the most elegant, and therefore most befitting that particular character of ideal beauty which the dramatist here assigns to his imaginary princess.
Ganymede, the name she assumes in her disguise as a forest youth, is that of 'Jove's own page' (I, iii, 127), the most beautiful of all mortals, son of Tros and Callirrhoe, chosen by Jupiter to be his cup-bearer, and to dwell among the gods as his chosen servant.

Maya Cohen Levy

Maya Cohen Levy (born 1955), also known as Maya Cohen-Levy, is an Israeli painter and sculptor.
Life and work.
Maya Cohen Levy was born in Tel Aviv. She studied philosophy at Tel Aviv University from 1973 to 1974. From 1975 to 1979, she pursued advanced studies at the High School for Art in Tel Aviv. In 1983, she went to Japan to study calligraphy and sumi-e painting.
Heavily pregnant in 1984, she was told by a senior artist in the Kalisher School of Art, "You'll never be an artist now." She said this made her feel terrible, but also strengthened: "We were operating in a male environment, in a culture that believed that the great artists are men. It doesn't matter what your feminist views were, in the end you were left with that. The way to success was to adopt that attitude and not to be a mother. Women who wanted to enter the field had to be like that." In the 1980s, after gaining a stipend to work at a center in the United States, she said that she would attend with her daughter, and was sent rules, which included "no children or pets".
She initially believed that she had to make the choice between motherhood and a career as an artist, but became one of the few women artists at that time who decided that motherhood was compatible with being an artist. Women artists of the previous generation had either chosen not to have children, or left children with others to look after, such as Lea Nikel, whose daughter lived in a kibbutz. Very few women were art school teachers and those who were did not have children.
1994-5, she studied calligraphy in Beijing, China. In 2000, she had an exhibition "Ponds 1995-2000", sponsored by The Nelford Foundation, at Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The paintings used the theme of ponds in various forms.
In 2002, she was one of the 10 Israeli artists invited to participate in the first seminar of Ma'aseh Hoshev (Informed Creations), under the auspice of the Schechter Institute for Jewish Studies (SIJS). The aim of the project was to connect Talmudic knowledge with artistic creation. Levy's contribution addressed the Israel-Palestinian conflict with the superimposition of a text from the bible onto the statement made by an arrested Palestinian man.
In 2006, her painting "Roots" (right) was sold at Sotheby's, whose catalogue notes said:
She had painted other works with the same title 2000–2002.
The characteristic of her work is a complexity of paint streaks, which have used organic images such as the honeycomb, the palm tree and the sunflower, where her discovery of the golden spiral organisation of the plant's seeds led to an exploration of the Islamic tradition, which counterbalanced her initial influence from Abstract Expressionism and resulted in depictions of upside-down trees, whose branches thus appear to be roots.
Her work includes paintings, sculptures, installations and books in collaboration with writers and poets. She has taught for 25 years in schools including Bezalel Art Academy in Jerusalem and the Kalisher Art School in Tel Aviv.
Levy lives in Tel Aviv.

WordSmith Tools, in short, Wordsmith (which means 'word' and 'creator') is a paid software package primarily for linguists, in particular for work in the field of corpus linguistics. It is a collection of modules for searching patterns in a language. The software is also available in several languages.
Development and Acquisition.
The program package was developed by the British linguist Mike Scott at the University of Liverpool and released as version 1.0 in 1996. It is based on the also co-developed by Mike Scott and in 1993 was first introduced concordance program "Micro Concord". Versions 1.0 through 4.0 were sold exclusively by Word Smith from the British Oxford University and the local Oxford University Press, the current version 5.0 and previous versions are now also distributed by the Lexical Analysis Software Limited. The current version of the software with the operating system from Windows can be used on a single computer or over a network 2000th. Under certain conditions, the software runs on an Apple operating system and Linux. Setting up the software on the computer is extremely simple without installer. Currently, the WordSmith Tools versions 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 as well as the narrower program MicroConcoord (no version upgrades with other names exist) are available. Wordsmith is acquired by downloading a self-extracting executable file for the time being as a demo version. This includes all the features of the full version, there are only 25 hits for a query and edited. The update to the full version by entering a code, which is a fee (online or written order) of the moment (October 2011), about 50 pounds sterling awarded for a single user license.
Functionality and Applications.
The core areas of the software package includes three modules:
Each of the modules is offering a number of features available to certain other features of the analyzed text corpus. Thus, for example, collocation s given to the searched word forms, i.e. a collection (supplemented with a number of additional information) of those words created that occur together with the search word. In addition to this core offer are a number of additional modules that are useful for the preparation and reproduction of the text corpus. WordSmith Tools can be used in 80 different languages. WordSmith Tools is - along with several other software products similar in nature - an internationally popular program for the work based on corpus-linguistic methodology. Can be used in this type of software not only in the Theoretical linguistics, but also for example in the text linguistics media linguistics and discourse analysis, but also in some other, adjacent disciplines of linguistics. Such software is used, for example, to answer questions of use of certain words in certain syntactic structures, or the determination of content or meaning of certain expressions in certain texts or text places. This, among other things, certain patterns can be found in texts.

Queen City Rocker

Queen City Rocker is a 1986 New Zealand film which was sold by Richard Lymposs, a sixteen-year-old youth with no prior film or writing experience. "Queen City Rocker" was bought by Larry Parr a budding Auckland film producer in 1981 and shot in 1985. Director Bruce Morrison, starring Matthew Hunter, Mark Pilisi and Kim Willoughby. The film is also called "Tearaway". 
The original story focused on the friendship between two buddies in actual warring gangs of that time in Auckland. No mention of these two gangs were in the film.
It is understood the Auckland Street gangs "The Boot Boys" and the "King Cobras" were the inspiration behind this story. In 1979-1981 in Auckland these two warring enemies had vicious street brawls - even in New Zealand's main street, Queen Street, before horror struck late night shoppers, making front page news of New Zealand papers, where racial issues were often glossed over as harmonious.
The original story made statement to the paradox of friendship, where both youths were technically enemies, caught in amongst the lower socio economic times thwart with violence, in a racially charged environment, aligning with different gangs. (The Pakeha and Maori between the first generation Samoan youths). The Punk/Ska/Reggae music of the late 70's - early 80's was vibrant and a relevant under-swell in the Auckland music scene.
By the time "Queen City Rocker" was filmed the script had been softened for a potential commercial market, as had the soundtrack, and when the film was in the can the reference between real gangs had been lost and the two stars were buddies in the same "group", the term "gang" had become unpalatable.

Most famous of them being the Taj Mahal. Moti Masjid earned the epithet Pearl Mosque for it shined like a pearl. It is held that this mosque was constructed by Shah Jahan for his members of royal court.
Architecture.
It stands on ground that slopes from east to west to the north of Diwan-i-Am complex in Agra Fort. The courtyard of the Moti Masjid has side arcades and arched recessions and the main sanctuary facade beyond. The sanctuary is roofed with three bulbous domes built of light white marble and stand on the red sandstone walls. There are a series of Hindu-style domed kiosks along the parapet. There are seven bays that are divided into aisles which are supported by piers and lobed arches. The Moti Masjid boasts of extensive white marble facing, a typical stylistic feature of architecture during the reign of Shah Jahan.
This masjid was constructed at a cost of 1 lakh and 60 thousand rupees and took four years to build. According to Sant Nihal Singh, "It struggles of the soul to soar above worldly entanglements."

Optical properties of carbon nanotubes

Within materials science, the optical properties of carbon nanotubes refer specifically to the absorption, photoluminescence (fluorescence), and Raman spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes. Spectroscopic methods offer the possibility of quick and non-destructive characterization of relatively large amounts of carbon nanotubes. There is a strong demand for such characterization from the industrial point of view: numerous parameters of the nanotube synthesis can be changed, intentionally or unintentionally, to alter the nanotube quality. As shown below, optical absorption, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopies allow quick and reliable characterization of this "nanotube quality" in terms of non-tubular carbon content, structure (chirality) of the produced nanotubes, and structural defects. Those features determine nearly any other properties such as optical, mechanical, and electrical properties.
Carbon nanotubes are unique "one-dimensional systems" which can be envisioned as rolled single sheets of graphite (or more precisely graphene). This rolling can be done at different angles and curvatures resulting in different nanotube properties. The diameter typically varies in the range 0.4–40 nm (i.e. "only" ~100 times), but the length can vary ~10,000 times, reaching 18.5 cm. Thus the nanotube aspect ratio, or the length-to-diameter ratio, can be as high as 132,000,000:1, which is unequalled by any other material. Consequently, all the properties of the carbon nanotubes relative to those of typical semiconductors are extremely anisotropic (directionally dependent) and tunable. 
Whereas mechanical, electrical and electrochemical (supercapacitor) properties of the carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light and the possibility of its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.
Terminology.
This article uses the following abbreviations:
However, C is often omitted in scientific literature, so NT, SWNT and MWNT are more commonly used. Also, "wall" is often exchanged with "walled".
Electronic structure of carbon nanotube.
[[Image:CNTnames.png|thumb|The ("n", "m") nanotube naming scheme can be thought of as a vector (Ch) in an infinite graphene sheet that describes how to "roll up" the graphene sheet to make the nanotube. T denotes the tube axis, and a1 and a2 are the unit vectors of graphene in real space.]]
A single-wall carbon nanotube can be imagined as graphene sheet rolled at a certain "chiral" angle with respect to a plane perpendicular to the tube's long axis. Consequently, SWCNT can be defined by its diameter and chiral angle. The chiral angle can range from 0 to 30 degrees.
However, more conveniently, a pair of indices ("n", "m") is used instead. The indices refer to equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be considered the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper right corner of the diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices ("n", "m"), draw "n" a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw "m" a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4, 2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.
Tubes having "n" = "m" (chiral angle = 30°) are called "armchair" and those with "m" = 0 (chiral angle = 0°) "zigzag". Those indices uniquely determine whether CNT is a metal, semimetal or semiconductor, as well as its band gap: when |"m" – "n"| = 3"k" ("k" is integer), the tube is metallic; but if |"m" – "n"| = 3"k" ± 1, the tube is semiconducting. The nanotube diameter "d" is related to "m" and "n" as
In this equation, "a" = 0.246 nm is the magnitude of either unit vector a1 or a2.
The situation in multi-wall CNTs is complicated as their properties are determined by contribution of all individual shells; those shells have different structures, and, because of the synthesis, are usually more defective than SWCNTs. Therefore, optical properties of MWCNTs will not be considered here.
Van Hove singularities.
Optical properties of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within one-dimensional density of states (DOS). A typical feature of one-dimensional crystals is that their DOS is not a continuous function of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike. In contrast, three-dimensional materials have continuous DOS. The sharp peaks found in one-dimensional materials are called Van Hove singularities.
Van Hove singularities result in the following remarkable optical properties of carbon nanotubes: 
Kataura plot.
The band structure of carbon nanotubes having certain ("n", "m") indexes can be easily calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the ("n", "m") index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10, 1) and (8, 3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but the latter is semiconductor.
Optical absorption.
Optical absorption in carbon nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) instead of an absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the "v"2 to "c"2 (energy "E"22) or "v"1 to "c"1 ("E"11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp and can be used to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar "E"22 or "E"11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual ("E"22, "E"11) pairs. 
Interactions between nanotubes, such as bundling, broaden optical lines. While bundling strongly affects photoluminescence, it has much weaker effect on optical absorption and Raman scattering. Consequently, sample preparation for the latter two techniques is relatively simple. 
Optical absorption is routinely used to quantify quality of the carbon nanotube powders. 
The spectrum is analyzed in terms of intensities of nanotube-related peaks, background and pi-carbon peak; the latter two mostly originate from non-nanotube carbon in contaminated samples. However, it has been recently shown that by aggregating nearly single chirality semiconducting nanotubes into closely packed Van der Waals bundles the absorption background can be attributed to free carrier transition originating from intertube charge transfer. 
Carbon nanotubes as a black body.
An ideal black body should have emissivity or absorbance of 1.0, which is difficult to attain in practice, especially in a wide spectral range. Vertically aligned "forests" of single-wall carbon nanotubes can have absorbances of 0.98–0.99 from the far-ultraviolet (200 nm) to far-infrared (200 μm) wavelengths. Super black, a coating based on chemically etched nickel-phosphorus alloy, is another material approaching the absorption of 1.0. 
These SWNT forests (buckypaper) were grown by the super-growth CVD method to about 10 μm height. Two factors could contribute to strong light absorption by these structures: (i) a distribution of CNT chiralities resulted in various bandgaps for individual CNTs. Thus a compound material was formed with broadband absorption. (ii) Light might be trapped in those forests due to multiple reflections.
Luminescence.
Photoluminescence (Fluorescence).
Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually occurs as follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via "S"22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from "c"2 to "c"1 and from "v"2 to "v"1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a "c"1 − "v"1 transition resulting in light emission. 
No excitonic luminescence can be produced in metallic tubes. Their electrons can be excited, thus resulting in optical absorption, but the holes are immediately filled by other electrons out of the many available in the metal. Therefore, no excitons are produced.
Sensitization.
Optical properties, including the PL efficiency, can be modified by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.
Cathodoluminescence.
Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light emission excited by electron beam — is a process commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain ("n", "m") indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.
Electroluminescence.
If appropriate electrical contacts are attached to a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes.
Raman scattering.
Raman spectroscopy has good spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy is probably the most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below. 
Similar to photoluminescence mapping, the energy of the excitation light can be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying ("n", "m") indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, and it is less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.
Radial breathing mode.
Radial breathing mode (RBM) corresponds to radial expansion-contraction of the nanotube. Therefore, its frequency "ν"RBM (in cm−1) depends on the nanotube diameter "d" as, "ν"RBM A/"d" + B (where A and B are constants dependent on the environment in which the nanotube is present. For example B=0 for individual nanotubes.) (in nanometers) and can be estimated as for SWNT or for DWNT, which is very useful in deducing the CNT diameter from the RBM position. Typical RBM range is 100–350 cm−1. If RBM intensity is particularly strong, its weak second overtone can be observed at double frequency.
Bundling mode.
The bundling mode is a special form of RBM supposedly originating from collective vibration in a bundle of SWCNTs.
G mode.
Another very important mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and is present in most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580 cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting. A wider pattern indicates semiconducting nature of the nanotube.
D mode.
"D" mode is present in all graphite-like carbons and originates from structural defects. Therefore, the ratio of the "G"/"D" modes is conventionally used to quantify the structural quality of carbon nanotubes. High-quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the "G"/"D" ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.
G' mode.
The name of this mode is misleading: it is given because in graphite, this mode is usually the second strongest after the G mode. However, it is actually the second overtone of the defect-induced D mode (and thus should logically be named D'). Its intensity is stronger than that of the D mode due to different selection rules. In particular, D mode is forbidden in the ideal nanotube and requires a structural defect, providing a phonon of certain angular momentum, to be induced. In contrast, G' mode involves a "self-annihilating" pair of phonons and thus does not require defects. The spectral position of G' mode depends on diameter, so it can be used roughly to estimate the SWCNT diameter. In particular, G' mode is a doublet in double-wall carbon nanotubes, but the doublet is often unresolved due to line broadening. 
Other overtones, such as a combination of RBM+G mode at ~1750 cm−1, are frequently seen in CNT Raman spectra. However, they are less important and are not considered here.
Anti-Stokes scattering.
All the above Raman modes can be observed both as scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy is similar to the laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.
Rayleigh scattering.
Carbon nanotubes have very large aspect ratio, i.e., their length is much larger than their diameter. Consequently, as expected from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.
Another manifestation of Rayleigh scattering is the "antenna effect", an array of nanotubes standing on a substrate has specific angular and spectral distributions of reflected light, and both those distributions depend on the nanotube length.

Orlando (As You Like It)

Orlando is a fictional character and the romantic male lead in the comedy "As You Like It" (1599/1600) by William Shakespeare.
Orlando is the youngest son of the deceased Sir Rowland de Boys and a brother to Oliver. He is brave, chivalrous, tender, modest, smart, strong, handsome and beloved by all. He resents the harsh treatment he receives at Oliver's hands and complains that Oliver neglects to educate him; Orlando feels that he is being "kept" like livestock. Despite this neglect, Orlando's talents and his aristocratic nature reveal themselves, and he becomes his father's favourite. He has a will to attain knowledge and wanted to go to school. Nevertheless, he is not successful in expressing his love to Rosalind.
Orlando, in the beginning of the play is complaining about the harsh treatment given to him by his brother, Oliver, and is saying that Oliver is not even giving him the paltry sum of 1000 crowns gifted to him by will . He is portrayed as exceptionally strong in both body and in his devotion to love. It is these qualities that make Rosalind fall for him as well.
After angering Oliver's crony Duke Frederick, Orlando flees his familiar surroundings to live in exile in the Forest of Arden. There, he is accepted into the circle of the usurped Duke Senior and is eventually united in marriage with his daughter, Rosalind. Actor Laurence Olivier notably played the character in a 1936 film with Elizabeth Bergner opposite him as Rosalind.

Steve MacIntyre

Steven "Big Mac" MacIntyre (born August 8, 1980) is a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger currently playing for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and is known as an enforcer.
Playing career.
Amateur.
MacIntyre came to the Continental Elite Hockey League (CEHL) in 2001, after earning the reputation as one of Canada's best fighters in Major Junior circles. He was recruited to play for the Tri-City Hurricanes in Bay City, Michigan, who later became the Bay County Blizzard after a mid-season sale of the team by original owner Mike Killbreath. MacIntyre led the CEHL in penalty minutes and received a lifetime ban late in the season for his part in a nasty brawl with the Detroit Lightning. Banned by the CEHL, MacIntyre signed with the Muskegon Fury of the United Hockey League (UHL) and he helped them win the UHL's Colonial Cup, as playoff champions.
Professional.
On May 22, 2003, he was signed by the New York Rangers, after playing two seasons as the most feared fighter in the UHL. He would spend the next two years within the Rangers' minor league affiliates, the Hartford Wolf Pack and the Charlotte Checkers, before having brief stints playing for the Quad City Mallards and the Providence Bruins, in 2006–07 and 2007–08, respectively.
On July 3, 2008, he signed as a free agent with the Florida Panthers, having never played an NHL game in a Rangers uniform. This would turn out to be MacIntyre's first stint in Florida (before returning in 2009). He was assigned to their minor league affiliates, the Rochester Americans on waivers, on September 28, 2008. He was picked up on waivers by the Edmonton Oilers two days later, on September 30. MacIntyre had an immediate impact in Edmonton, playing his first NHL game on October 3, against the Oilers' arch-rivals, the Calgary Flames - earning himself 7 minutes in the penalty box; 2 minutes for roughing and a further 5 minutes for a fight with Jim Vandermeer.
On November 11, 2008, the Oilers placed MacIntyre on their Injured Reserve (IR) list, with a fractured orbital bone, an injury he sustained from a fight five nights earlier, against the Pittsburgh Penguins with fellow NHL "heavyweight" Eric Godard. He subsequently would miss the next 26 games. He would make his return on January 11, 2009, in a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Blues. Two nights later, January 13, MacIntyre would score his first NHL goal, in a 5-2 victory over the Washington Capitals. MacIntyre would add another goal later in the 2008–09 season and would finish with a total of 2 points from 22 games, collecting 40 penalty minutes.
On November 9, 2009, he was assigned to the Oilers' minor league affiliate, the Springfield Falcons on waivers, after playing bit parts in 4 games. However, he would be picked up a day later, on November 10, by his former team, the Florida Panthers. He would spend the rest of the 2009–10 season between the Panthers and their AHL affiliates, the Rochester Americans, helping the Americans reach the 2010 Calder Cup Playoffs.
On July 2, 2010, Steve MacIntyre signed a 1-year contract with the Edmonton Oilers, returning to the team he started his NHL career with. In an interview on The Team 1260 MacIntyre said "he was excited to be back" and was "very thankful" at the chance for another opportunity to play for the Oilers.
On July 1, 2011 MacIntyre became a free agent. He later signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 12.
On January 11, 2012, the Pittsburgh Penguins placed Steve MacIntyre on waivers, and he was sent down to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins after he cleared waivers on January 12, 2012.
On September 23, 2013, The Edmonton Oilers claimed Steve MacIntyre off waivers, making it the third time the player is with the organization.

<doc id="19726765" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19726765" title="Tag (programming)">
Tag (programming)

In programming, a tag is an argument to a subroutine that determines other arguments passed to it, which is used as a way to pass indefinite number of tagged parameters to the subroutine; notably, tags are used for a number of system calls in AmigaOS v2.0 and onwards.
In AmigaOS.
In earlier versions of AmigaOS, if a system call required setting a large number of parameters, instead of passing them as function arguments, the function would require a pointer to a structure that holds the arguments (for example, intuition.library's codice_1 required codice_2 with 17 different parameters). Tags were introduced in AmigaOS 2.0 because they "make it possible to add new parameters to system functions without interfering with the original parameters. They also make specifying parameter lists much clearer and easier."
A number of third-party software libraries for AmigaOS also use tags extensively.
Example.
Note how the code without tags is obscure (for example, codice_3 define window colors) while the code with tags is self-documenting. Note also that fewer parameters have to be defined with tags than are in the structure, as OpenWindowTags will fall back to default parameters.
Implementation.
AmigaOS provides functions for tag handling in its codice_4.
In general.
An advantage of tags is that they ease the work with default arguments since the programmer doesn't have to specify them or their substitutes. From this follows another advantage, ease of achieving of both forward and backward compatibility with external libraries: a program written for an older version of the library will work with a newer one, since the newer library will simply set all the parameters not provided by the program to their default values; and a program written for a newer version of the library will still work with the older version, since the older library will simply pay no attention to the newly introduced tags.
A disadvantage of tags is that their processing is slower than simply reading data from a structure or the stack. Additionally, compile time type checking is lost.

The Jamaicans

The Jamaicans were a ska/rocksteady trio formed in Jamaica in 1967, consisting of members Tommy Cowan, Norris Weir and Martin Williams.
Career.
The Jamaicans originally started out as a band known as the Cool Shakes, consisting of Jerry Brown and childhood friend Norris Weir, joined later by Martin Williams. Then Tommy Cowan joined the group to make them a quintet. The group soon changed their name to the Jamaicans, cutting two singles for Duke Reid at Treasure Isle - "Pocket Full of Money" and "Diana". They had their first hit in 1967 with "Things You Say You Love". They would also take first place in the Island's Festival Song Contest in 1967 with the rocksteady classic "Ba Ba Boom" (by this time without Jerry in the group), written by Cowan and Weir about the Jamaica Independence Festival. "Ba Ba Boom" was entered in the 1967 Independence Festival Song Competition (now known as the Popular Song Competition), which had been inaugurated by Festival organizers the previous year, and the Jamaicans took home the win that year with their entry, which became their best-known song.
In addition to "Ba Ba Boom", the Jamaicans had another local hit with "Things You Say You Love" and they recorded a cover of the Curtis Mayfield song "Dedicate My Song to You". Another song written and recorded by the trio, "Black Girl", was later covered by the disco group Boney M. The Jamaicans split up in 1972. Cowan went on to become a successful producer.

<doc id="19726782" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19726782" title="Czesław Lejewski">
Czesław Lejewski

Czesław Lejewski ( 1913–2001 ) was a Polish philosopher and logician, and a member of the Lwow-Warsaw School of Logic. He studied under Jan Łukasiewicz and Karl Popper in the London School of Economics, and W.V.O. Quine.
Logic and Existence (1954–5).
In his paper "Logic and Existence" (1954–5) he presented a version of free logic. He begins by presenting the problem of non-referring nouns, and commends Quine for resisting the temptation to solve the problem by saying that non-referring names are meaningless. Quine's solution, however, was that we must first decide whether our name refers before we know how to treat it logically. Lejewski found this unsatisfactory because we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring names. He goes on to write, "This state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory. The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences (existential generalization and universal instantiation) may prove worth our while." (parenthesis not Lejewski's).
He then elaborates a very creative formal language: Take a domain consisting of a and b, and two signs 'a' and 'b' which refer to these elements. There is one predicate, "Fx". There is no need for universal or existential quantification, in the style of Quine in his "Methods of Logic". The only possible atomic statements are Fa and Fb. We now introduce new signs but no new elements in the domain. 'c' refers to neither element and 'd' refers to either. Thus, formula_1 is true. We now introduce the predicate "Dx" which is true for d. We have no reason, here, to contend that formula_2, and thus to claim that there is something which does not exist. We simply do not have good reason to make existential claims about the referent of every sign, since that would assume that every sign refers. Instead, we should remain agnostic until we have better information. By the stipulations given here, however, we have downright good reason to be atheists about c, and have good reason to still claim formula_3 to boot.
Lejewski calls this account the "unrestricted" interpretation. The "restricted" interpretation is then the language which does not distinguish between signs and elements, and so is forced to claim formula_4 is true. It is obvious that everything expressible in the unrestricted interpretation is expressible in the restricted interpretation. A generalization to infinite domains and infinite signs is easy. A generalization to infinite predicates needs no explanation.
A convenient fact is that this logic can also accommodate the domain of the null set, as quantificational claims will not need to assume an element in the domain. For example, formula_5 will be true on an empty domain using the unrestricted interpretation, where 'c' still does not refer. The proof is that, assuming the antecedent true, we must understand the quantifiers to make no claims about the elements of the domain but only about the signs. He thus suggests that we abandon the interpretation of existential quantification as "there exists an x" and replace it with "for some (sign) x" (parenthesis not Lejewski's). He also suggests that the inference corresponding to existential generalization be termed "particular generalization". Where it is correct to apply the predicate "Fx" to every sign in the domain, it is correct to apply the predicate to a given sign in the domain. Thus the conditional is true. (Hence the treatment above that distinguishes existential quantification and the meta-linguistic statement 'x exists'.) Using the restricted interpretation, we see that the claim becomes formula_6 which is false. The main antecedent is vacuously true. This is because nothing exists and so, for every sign, the inner antecedent is false, and so vauously true. The consequent is false, because where the antecedent is true the consequent tells us that something exists. In the null set, this is always false. Quine's response to the problem of the empty set had been that it was a problem never faced in reality, which Lejewski found unsatisfying.
Lejewski then goes on to extend this interpretation to the language of inclusion, and presents an axiomatization of an unrestricted logic.
This logic was later developed more fully by Karel Lambert, who called the unrestricted interpretation "free logic". Instead of the meta-linguistic 'x exists', Lambert adopted the symbolization E!x, which can be axiomatized without existential quantification.

Georges Brunschvig

Georges Brunschvig (21 February 1908 – 14 October 1973) was a Swiss lawyer and president of the Swiss Federation of Jewish Communities (SIG). Internationally, he is best known for representing the plaintiff in the 1934–35 "Berne Trial".
Berne Trial.
Born in Berne to a family of Jewish horse traders, Brunschvig studied law at the University of Berne and passed the bar exam in 1933. In 1934, he founded a law firm on the "Marktgasse" in Berne and married his childhood friend Odette Wyler, with whom he had two daughters.
At the age of 25, in one of his first cases as an attorney, he and his colleague Emil Raas took up a criminal case by the SIG against the "Nationale Front", a movement of Swiss Nazi sympathizers. At the time, Frontists had taken to distributing antisemitic pamphlets on the streets, including "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion". Brunschvig won the case, later known by historians as the "Berne Trial", by a thorough debunking of the "Protocols". The defendants were convicted by the Bernese district court of violating a Bernese statute prohibiting the distribution of "immoral, obscene or brutalizing" texts. Even though they were acquitted on appeal – the Cantonal Supreme Court held that the "Protocols", while false, did not violate the statute because they were used as a means of political propaganda – Brunschvig had achieved the SIG's principal goal: a court holding debunking the "Protocols".
World War II.
During World War II, Brunschvig served as a captain with the military court of Berne. As president of the Bernese Jewish community and a board member of the SIG, Brunschvig was among the first in Switzerland to receive word of the deportation of German Jews to extermination camps. However, his and the SIG's efforts to stop the expulsion of Jewish refugees to Germany by Swiss authorities were largely fruitless. 
In August 1942, a Belgian Jewish couple were arrested by police in the Jewish Cemetery in Berne after having fled from Brussels through France to Switzerland on bicycles. Despite Brunschvig's intercession with the authorities, the couple was expelled from Switzerland the day after their arrest; after the war, Brunschvig found out that they had been killed in Auschwitz. This incident caused Brunschvig to abandon the restraint he had previously imposed upon himself so as not to lose what influence he had with the authorities. Through the journalist Hermann Böschenstein, he had the incident made public in the "Basler Nationalzeitung". The resulting public outcry caused Swiss border controls to be loosened temporarily.
Trial attorney.
In his work as an attorney, Brunschvig participated in several other high-profile criminal cases. From 1943 on, he was counsel to David Frankfurter, the assassin of Swiss Nazi leader Wilhelm Gustloff, and he was instrumental in achieving Frankfurter's pardon in 1945. He also represented the defence in the trials of Maria Popesco (1946–55), Max Ulrich (1957) and Ben Gal (1963). In 1969, he successfully defended Mordechai Rachamim, an El Al sky marshal who had shot and killed a Palestinian terrorist after the man had opened fire on passengers in Zürich Airport. Rachamim was acquitted on account of self-defence.
Lobbying for Israel.
In 1946, Brunschvig was elected president of the SIG, an office he held until his death. In that capacity he became the leading representative of Jewish and, later, Israeli interests in Switzerland. Together with government and bank representatives, he drafted a law intended to address the issue of dormant assets left with Swiss banks after the war; this did not, however, prevent the dormant assets from become a major political issue some 50 years later.
After the founding of Israel in 1948, Brunschvig arranged what public support he could for the new state. In 1967, he and his friend Reynold Tschäppät, by then mayor of Berne, convinced Bernese commercial leaders to launch a "Bratwurst" campaign in support of Israel, with one franc per sausage sold going to the Jewish state.
Brunschvig died on October 14, 1973 at a Jewish rally during the Yom Kippur war. He succumbed to a heart attack while delivering an emotional speech in support of Israel.

Ramakrishna's influence

Ramakrishna (1836–1886) is a famous nineteenth-century Indian Bengali Hindu mystic. Born as he was during a social upheaval in Bengal in particular and India in general, Ramakrishna and his movement—Ramakrishna Mission played a leading role in the modern revival of Hinduism in India, and on modern Indian history.
On Hinduism.
Ramakrishna and his chief disciple Swami Vivekananda are regarded as two of the key figures in the Bengal Renaissance of 19th century. Ramakrishna played a leading role in the modern revival of Hinduism in India and the movement—Ramakrishna Mission—he inspired has deeply influenced modern Indian history. Ramakrishna is also regarded as an influential figure on Keshab Chandra Sen and other Brahmos and on the Elite of Calcutta, the "bhadralok". Ramakrishna advocated "bhakti" and the Bhagavad Gita occupies an important place in his discourses. Ramakrishna practised several religions, including Islam and Christianity, and recognized that in spite of the differences, all religions are valid and true and they lead to the same ultimate goal—God. He was given a name that is from the Vaishnavite tradition (Rama and Krishna are both incarnations of Vishnu), but was a devotee of Kali, the mother goddess, and known to have followed various other religious paths including Tantrism, Christianity, and Islam.
Contributions to Humanity.
Max Müller, who was inspired by Ramakrishna, said:
Leo Tolstoy saw similarities between his and Ramakrishna's thoughts. He described him as a "remarkable sage". 
Romain Rolland considered Ramakrishna to be the "consummation of two thousand years of the spiritual life of three hundred million people." He said:
Mohandas Gandhi wrote:
Sri Aurobindo considered Ramakrishna to be an incarnation, or Avatar, of God on par with Gautama Buddha. He wrote:
Jawaharlal Nehru described Ramakrishna as "one of the great "rishis" of India, who had come to draw our attention to the higher things of life and of the spirit." Subhas Chandra Bose was also influenced by Ramakrishna. He said:
Philosopher Arindam Chakrabarti called Ramakrishna "The practically illiterate, faith-bound, emotional, otherworldly esoteric Ramakrishna who prayed to the Goddess: "May my rationalizing intellect be struck by thunder!" And yet in his views about the nature of ultimate reality, the relation between the self and the body, ways of knowing truth, moral and social duties of human beings and metatheoretical explanations of why mystics disagree...Ramakrishna was no less a philosopher than Buddha or Socrates.
On Indian Nationalism.
Rabindranath Tagore, Aurobindo Ghosh, Mahatma Gandhi, have acknowledged Ramakrishna and Vivekananda's contribution to Indian Nationalism. This is particularly evident in Ramakrishna’s development of the Mother-symbolism and its eventual role in defining the incipient Indian nationalism.
Vivekananda, Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.
Vivekananda, Ramakrishna’s most illustrious disciple, is considered by some to be one of his most important legacies. Vivekananda spread the message of Ramakrishna across the world. He also helped introduce Hinduism to the west. He founded two organisations based on the teachings of Ramakrishna. One was Ramakrishna Mission, which is designed to spread the word of Ramakrishna. Vivekananda also designed its emblem. Ramakrishna Math was created as a monastic order based on Ramakrishna’s teachings.
The temples of Ramakrishna are called the "Universal Temples". The first "Universal temple" was built at Belur, which is the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission.
Works related to Ramakrishna.
In 2006, composer Philip Glass wrote "The Passion of Ramakrishna" — a choral work as a "tribute to Ramakrishna". It premiered on September 16, 2006 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, California, performed by Orange County’s Pacific Symphony Orchestra conducted by Carl St. Clair with the Pacific Chorale directed by John Alexander. Franz Dvorak (1862–1927), a painter from Prague, inspired by the teachings of Ramakrishna made several paintings of Ramakrishna and Sarada Devi.

Views on Ramakrishna

Ramakrishna (1836–1886), is a 19th-century Indian mystic whose teachings form the foundation of the Ramakrishna religious movement and the Ramakrishna Mission.
Religious views.
Christianity.
Ramakrishna's first encounter with Christianity was in 1874, when he heard the Bible being read at his devotee Malik's house. He later practised Christianity, and later had a vision of Jesus Christ. Ramakrishna regarded Jesus as "the great Yogi". Ramakrishna's teachings and personality have been studied from the point of Christianity by scholars such as Romain Rolland, Paul Hourihan. Romain Rolland referred to Ramakrishna as the "younger brother of Christ". Another book, "Ramakrishna & Christ, the Supermystics: New Interpretations" compares the life and spiritual beliefs of Ramakrishna with that of Jesus Christ. Francis X Clooney, a Roman Catholic priest and member of the Society of Jesus, writes that Ramakrishna's vision of Christ, "shows Christians like myself a way to respond to the mystery, beauty and holiness of non-Christian religious experiences". Religious scholar D.S. Sharma and Romain Rolland notes similarities between Ramakrishna's mystic experiences and other religious personalities—St. Paul, Henry Suso—a German mystic of the 14th century, Richard Rolle of Hampole, and St.Theresa of Avila.
Islam.
Ramakrishna also practised Islam as a part of his "sadhana" (spiritual disciplines). According to Ramakrishna, his practice of Islam culminated in a vision of Mohammed. Ramakrishna's teachings and experiences have been studied from the perspective of Islam, and compared with teachings of the Sufi saints, by scholars like A. J. A. Tyeb. Tyeb notes that Ramakrishna's "sadhana" of meditating alone at night in the forest for several days is similar to the 19th century mystic, Sayed Sah Murshid Ali Quaderi. Tyeb writes that Ramakrishna's prayer to the goddess "Kali" is similar to that of Rabia, who is described as 'a woman who lost herself in union with the Divine'. Tyeb also writes that Al Muhasibi, a 9th-century Sufi of Baghdad, spoke of meditation in the same way as Ramakrishna did.
Bhawuk, in his journal, "Culture's influence on creativity: the case of Indian spirituality" wrote that Ramakrishna's contribution to humanity is significant for the world after the bombing of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Bhawuk writes that Islam is not to be blamed for the September 11 attacks, and no religion should be blamed for any act of terrorism, because the life of Ramakrishna proclaims that all religions lead to the same God.
Psychoanalysis and sexuality.
Ramakrishna's personality and actions have been a popular topic of psychologcal analysis by scholars and writers, especially in the Western world. In addition to his mystical experiences, much attention has been paid to his attitudes towards sexuality and the role of sex in his philosophical and religious views. Some of these studies have been extremely controversial.
Swami Vivekananda.
Swami Vivekananda, who would in time become Ramakrishna's most ardent and prominent disciple, initially viewed Ramakrishna's ecstasy as pathological, questioned his qualification of Kali as the "mother of universe", and did not accept him as an "avatara". Vivekananda regarded the "Advaitist Vedantism" of identity with the Absolute as blasphemy and madness. After a period of revolt, Ramakrishna was accepted as a "guru".
Referring to the practice of "Madhura Bhava", by his guru, in a speech in 1896, "My Master", Vivekananda said,
Referring to the teaching of "Kama-Kanchana", Vivekananda said,
Romain Rolland.
In his book "The Life of Ramakrishna" (1929), Romain Rolland, argues that Ramakrishna's experiences were not pathological. Rolland also argues the inapplicability of psychoanalysis on Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda and other mystics. Rolland had correspondence with Freud. In his letter of December 5, 1927, Rolland indicated that he was researching a book on the Hindu saints Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. The references to Freud and psychoanalysis in these books are considered as direct response to "Civilization and Its Discontents".
Leo Schneiderman.
Leo Schneiderman in his work, "Ramakrishna: Personality and Social Factors in the Growth of a Religious Movement" (1969) argues that Ramakrishna's "bizarre" behaviour ("samadhi") must be judged within its proper cultural context. According to Schneiderman, since Ramakrishna was a Brahmin priest who combined the performance of traditional religious functions with demonstrations of divine possession, especially in "samādhi", he could appeal to a wide clientele, and he was both an exemplar of Redfield's "great tradition" of Hinduism, and of village shamanism, sublimated to a very high plane. Schneiderman argues that Ramakrishna's trances and other dramatic manifestations, including perhaps, even his psychotic behaviour, were not truly aberrations from the standpoint of the non-Sanskritic popular culture.
Walter G. Neevel.
In the 1976 essay, "The Transformation of Sri Ramakrishna", Walter G. Neevel argues that Ramakrishna's life went through three "transformations". The first—the transformation of the "madman" of the early years to the benign, saintly figure of the later years—appears to have been brought about more by shifting public opinion than personal spiritual progression. According to Neevel, the second and third transformations reflect not historically verifiable ideas or events in the life of the saint but myth-making and misrepresentation, often by his most intimate followers and disciples. Neevel argues that the saint is incorrectly depicted as an advaitin of the Sankarite school.
Amiya Prosad Sen argues that Neevel's essay overlooks certain problems. Neevel does not place the ascriptions of Ramakrishna as an advaitin or vedantin in the historical context of Indian philosophy, as did Western-educated intelligentsia like Ram Mohan Roy. Amiya Sen writes that contrary to what Neevel suggests, "the maddened state of Ramakrishna" during his early practice is described by the "Vivekachudamani", an advaitic text as one of the spiritually exalted states. Sen further writes that "Vivekananda derived the social service gospel under direct inspiration from Ramakrishna rests very substantially on the liminal quality of the Master's message". Neevel attributes Ramakrishna's ability to lapse into trance was largely due to his aesthetic and emotional sensitivity.
Narasingha Sil.
In 1991, historian Narasingha Sil wrote "Ramakrishna Paramahamsa: A Psychological Profile", an account of Ramakrishna that argues that Ramakrishna's mystical experiences were pathological and originated from alleged childhood sexual trauma. Narasingha Sil links Ramakrishna's teaching of "Kamini-Kanchana" to traditional rural Bengali misogyny. Sil also says that Ramakrishna made his wife into a deity in order to avoid thinking of her as sexual.
Sil's theory has been disputed as reductive by William B. Parsons, who has called for an increased empathetic dialogue between the classical/adaptive/transformative schools and the mystical traditions for an enhanced understanding of Ramakrishna's life and experiences. Bengali Scholar William Radice wrote that, "Sil has debunked the saint so thoroughly and gleefully that it is hard to see how he will recover, once Sil's book becomes widely known."
Dr.Jeanne Openshaw.
Dr. Jeanne Openshaw, a senior lecturer in Religious Studies who specializes in the area of Bengali Vaishnavism and Culture, argues that the behaviour or religious practices of Ramakrishna are not necessarily abnormal. Openshaw writes that from the context of devotional Bengali "Vaishnavism", where femininity represents the highest attainable condition, the cultivation of femininity by men in various ways is not necessarily abnormal, nor can it be taken as a sign of homosexuality. Openshaw writes that in rural Bengal, male celibacy, and conservation of semen are considered important. Openshaw argues that Ramakrishna's attempt to see all women as mothers rather than as sexual partners, cannot be seen in terms of homoerotic tendencies.
Sudhir Kakar.
In 1991, Sudhir Kakar wrote ""The Analyst and the Mystic"" Gerald James Larson wrote, "Indeed, Sudhir Kakar...indicates that there would be little doubt that from a psychoanalytic point of view Ramakrishna could be diagnosed as a secondary transsexual... For anyone even casually acquainted with Bengali spirituality and cultural life many of the symbolic visions and fantasies of Ramakrishna, which appear bizarre and even pathological when construed only in isolation or individually, become much less so when one relates the visions and fantasies to nineteenth-century Bengal."
Kakar sought a meta-psychological, non-pathological explanation connecting Ramakrishna's mystical realization with creativity. Kakar also argued that culturally relative concepts of eroticism and gender have contributed to the Western difficulty in comprehending Ramakrishna. In 2003, Sudhir Kakar wrote a novel, "Ecstasy". According to the author, the characters were modelled on Ramakrishna and Vivekananda.
Somnath Bhattacharya.
Somnath Bhattacharya further elaborates on the views related to transvestite and transsexuality traits of Ramakrishna. Bhattacharyya argues that dressing up in feminine attire as part of a legitimate and culturally accepted "sadhana" for a short period of time does not amount to transvestism, since Ramakrishna also dressed like a "Shakta" and a "Vaishnava" during his Shakti and Vaishnava sadhana days, and like a Muslim during his Islam sadhana, which was in male attire. Bhattacharya argues that Ramakrishna's dressing habits were in line with this religious practice. Bhattacharya also argues that Ramakrishna cannot be described as a secondary transsexual. He quotes Ramakrishna's words. "Formerly I too used to see many visions, but now in my ecstatic state I don't see so many. I am gradually getting over my feminine nature; I feel nowadays more like a man. Therefore I control my emotions; I don't manifest it outwardly so much. ..." Bhattacharya writes that the American Psychiatric Association defines transsexuality as a strong and persistent cross-gender identification, and not merely a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex; it is a disorder always involving distress to the person, with a feeling of estrangement from the body and a felt need to alter the appearance of the body.
Jeffrey Kripal.
In 1995, religious scholar J. Kripal wrote "Kali's Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna", a psychoanalytic study of Ramakrishna. A review by W. Parsons described "Kali's Child" as a book "which performs a classic Freudian interpretation by seeing symptoms of repressed homoeroticism in the visions and acts of Ramakrishna, but then, in exemplifying the interdisciplinary approach of this dialogue, legitimates Ramakrishna's religious visions by situating psychoanalytic discourse in a wider Tantric world view." The book caused intense controversy among both Western and Indian audiences. In 1998 Kripal published a second edition of "Kali's Child", for which he claimed to have corrected the translation errors pointed out by the critics in the first edition.
In 1999, B. Hatcher wrote that, although some scholars of religion and South Asian culture had misgivings, their overall evaluation of "Kali's Child" was positive, and at times highly laudatory. However many reviews were negative. In India the book became known mainly through a scathing review by religious scholar Narasingha Sil in "The Statesman", Calcutta's major English-language daily, which resulted in a great deal of angry correspondence.
The deductions of "Kali's Child" and Kripal's credentials as a psychoanalyst were questioned by several Ramakrishna followers, such as Swami Tyagananda, and Swami Atmajnanananda, and by several scholars. Alan Roland wrote that Freudian approaches are not applicable when studying Asian cultures. In 2001, Huston Smith disputed Kripal's work as "colonialism updated". Somnath Bhattacharya wrote that Kripal is not qualified in psychoanalysis, and that "Kali's Child" contains many grave errors and distortions. In 2004, John Hawley revised his earlier positive evaluation of "Kali's Child", and wrote that Ramakrishna's torment should not devolve to a bodily level, and that that people with different sexual orientations should not indiscriminately impose their thoughts on religious communities. In 2007, Gayatri Spivak wrote that Kripal has misinterpreted "Ramakrishna's life as a "bhakta", as tantric practice" and claimed the book was full of cultural and linguistic mis-translations, so its general premise could not be taken seriously.
Kripal responded to the criticisms in journal articles and postings on his website, but stopped participating in the discussion in late 2002.
J.S. Hawley.
John Stratton Hawley, Professor of Religion at Barnard College, in his paper "The Damage of Separation: Krishna's Loves and Kali's Child" examines the following:
In this study, J.S. Hawley revisits the Kali's Child debate highlighting one of its central terms — the "vyakulata" feeling of Ramakrishna. J.S.Hawley argues that "neither the gopis’ torment nor Ramakrishna's must be allowed to devolve to a bodily level." Hawley further argues that "communities of people who respond to different sexual orientations should not indiscriminately impose their thoughts on religious communities...Eros is dangerous"
Alan Roland.
Attempts by modern authors to psychoanalyze Ramakrishna are questioned by practicing psychoanalyst Alan Roland, who has written extensively about applying Western psychoanalysis to Eastern cultures, and charges that psychoanalysis has been misapplied to Ramakrishna. Roland decries the facile decoding of Hindu symbols, such as Kali's sword and Krishna's flute, into Western sexual metaphors—thereby reducing Ramakrishna's spiritual aspiration to the basest psychopathology. The conflation of Ramakrishna's spiritual ecstasy, or samādhi, with unconscious dissociated states due to repressed homoerotic feelings is not based on common psychoanalytic definitions of these two different motivations, according to Roland. He also writes that it is highly questionable whether Ramakrishna's spiritual aspirations and experiences involve regression—responding to modern attempts to reduce Ramakrishna's spiritual states to a subconscious response to an imagined childhood trauma.
Kelley Ann Raab.
While most of the studies have been conducted from either a primarily psychoanalytic perspective or from the perspective of a devotee, Kelley Ann Raab's work — "Is There Anything Transcendent about Transcendence? A Philosophical and Psychological Study of Sri Ramakrishna", focuses upon Ramakrishna from both a philosophical perspective and a psychoanalytic perspective. The study argues that neither a purely psychological explanation nor a solely philosophical account of his visions is adequate to understand his madness or his godliness, but that together psychology and philosophy can deepen our understanding of Ramakrishna and find a common meeting ground. Raab argues that,
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.
Professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, taking the example of a "dvaita" gaze of a "boy looking up obliquely at the clay and wattle frame of the image of Durga", writes that when we read the photo through Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis it would be wrongly diagnosed as "double anxiety of castration and decapitation." Spivak writes that Freud's analysis is not culturally receptive and writes that Freud's psychoanalysis is an "occupational hazard". She writes that Ramakrishna was a "Bengali "bhakta" visionary" and that as a "bhakta", he turned chiefly towards Kali.
Insider views.
In 1997 Swami Atmajnanananda wrote, "Scandals, cover-ups, and other imagined occurrences in the life of Ramakrishna: An examination of Jeffrey Kripal's Kali's child". Swami Tyagananda, known for his tract "Kali's Child Revisited—or—Didn't Anyone Check the Documentation" distributed at the 2000 American Academy of Religion conference, co-authored "Interpreting Ramakrishna: Kali's Child Revisited" with Pravrajika Vrajaprana in 2010, which was published by Motilal Banarsidass.
"Interpreting Ramakrishna: Kali's Child Revisited".
"Interpreting Ramakrishna: Kali's Child Revisited" is a book authored by Swami Tyagananda and Pravrajika Vrajaprana, published by Motilal Banarsidass in 2010. The Foreword of the book has been written by religious scholar Huston Smith.
The authors of "Interpreting Ramakrishna" write that the conclusions arrived at by "Kali's Child" involve methodological problems including "mistranslation", "speculation" and "misdocumentation and context-tampering". The authors write that the Western academics who accepted the thesis of "Kali's Child" with positive reviews were "extremely unlikely" to have made a "close or extensive comparison" of the "Kathamrita" with that of Nikhilananda and Kripal's translations, and that and a majority of the reviewers were not Bengali readers. The authors write that "interpreting across cultural, religious and historical distances is always vexed, requiring great sensitivity and an openness to an enormous range of cultural issues and contexts." They write that psychoanalytical interpretations are unreliable to interpret linga/yoni symbolism, Tantra, or Ramakrishna's purported misogyny. The authors also discuss the history of Ramakrishna scholarship from 20th century to the present, dealing with scholars like Max Muller, Romain Rolland, Christopher Isherwood, Malcolm McLean, June McDaniel, Carl Oslon, Narasingha Sil, Jeffery Kripal, Sudhir Kakar and other interpreters.
Discussions and reviews.
A panel discussion on "Interpreting Ramakrishna" was held at the Dharma Academy of North America (DANAM) annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in October, 2010. Kusumita P. Pedersen, Professor of Religious Studies at St. Francis College in her review described the book as written with an "exemplary combination of civility, deep feeling and concern for accuracy...painstakingly thorough as well as probing and reflective." She describes the book as an "indispensable work for anyone concerned with the "Kali's Chld" debate and how Ramakrishna is understood...in the record of how India and the West have understood one another—or failed to do so." According to Kusumita Pedersen, the scholars who spoke at the panel discussion at DANAM, "praised the meticulous scholarship, substance and balance of "Interpreting Ramakrishna"".
Philip Goldberg called it "respectful, by-the-rules rebuttal" and a "exhaustive analysis" of "Kali's Child".
Frederick M. Smith of University of Iowa in "Religious Studies Review" wrote that the book "refutes Kripal's psychological interpretation" of Ramakrishna. Smith wrote that the book is "well-written" and "indispensable to the future of both Ramakrishna studies and to the history of late twentieth-century and early twenty-first century religious studies..."
June McDaniel in "Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies" wrote, "...to understand other cultures instead of getting into conflicts with them, greater empathy and clearer sight are needed. Perhaps it would be useful to have more academics who are also practitioners, like the authors of this book, who can walk the line between criticism and empathy. Interpreting Ramakrishna brings out some of the best of each side; it mixes the idealism and dedication of a meditative path with the critical scholarship and historical analysis of academia."
Tantra "Sadhana".
Different views on Ramakrishna's tantric "sadhana" have been expressed. The Tantra "sadhana" consisted of the "right-handed path" consisting of Kularnava, Mahanirvana and Kamalakala Vilasa involving celibate vegetarian lifestyle, japa, breath control, concentration, meditation and a set of heterodox practices which include but are not limited to the Vamachara—termed as "left-handed path", which involves drinking wine, eating meat, and sexual intercourse. Depending on an aspirant's disposition, Tantra prescribes a particular method for spiritual practice. In general, the Tantras classify people into three major groups "pasu" (animal), "vira" (hero), "divya" (godlike). According to Saradananda, Ramakrishna was in the "vira" stage during the practice of vamachara. Elizabeth U. Harding writes that the Tantra practices are aimed at rousing the "Kundalini" and peircing the six "chakras". Harding argues that Tantra is one of the paths for God-realization and cannot be branded as sensualism.
Christopher Isherwood writes that the object of the tantrik disciplines is "to see, behind all phenomena, the presence of God and to overcome the obstacles to this insight — attraction and aversion". Further Isherwood argues that words which normally carry sensual associations suggested higher meanings to Ramakrishna in his exalted state. For example, the word "yoni", which normally means the female sex-organ, would mean for him the divine source of creation. According to Isherwood, for Ramakrishna the most unconditionally obscene words were sacred to him as the vocabulary of the scriptures during the tantra "sadhana". Religious scholars note that the word "linga" represented "purusha", and "yoni" represented "prakriti".
Neevel argues that some of Ramakrishna's followers tend to be apologetic about his taking up tantric practices because of the eroticism that has discredited tantric schools in general and those of Bengal in particular. Neevel argues that the influence of tantra on this spiritual development is underestimated. Ramchandra Datta one of the early biographers of Ramakrishna is reported to have said, "We have heard many tales of the Brahmani but we hesitate to divulge them to the public."
In "Kali's Child", Jeffery Kripal argues that "Ramakrishna's world, then, was a Tantric world". Kripal further argues that Ramakrishna's Tantric practices were "omnipresent, defining virtually every point along Ramakrishna's spiritual development." Amiya P.Sen writes that "it is really difficult to separate the Tantrik Ramakrishna from the Vedantic", since Vedanta and Tantra "may appear to be differ in some respects", but they also "share some important postulates between them".

Lovejoy's islands

Lovejoy's islands were a group of groves in the Amazon Rainforest surrounded by clearings, created by Thomas Lovejoy.
Lovejoy discovered that when these forests became small patches, they lost their biodiversity, trees started to die, and birds left. The smallest groves were all edge, biologically speaking.
Purpose of the Experiment.
Lovejoy's experiment tested the effect of the cutting off of natural areas into small parcels, a process that has taken place throughout most of the world.
Natural Biological Islands.
A good example of a natural Lovejoy island is the Sky Islands of Arizona and Sonora, high elevation oases of northern plants and animals above the deserts.
As one would expect, many tropical islands are also naturally cut off from the outside world, while some of these are less diverse than the continents, other islands such as the Galapagos and Madagascar contain species found nowhere else.

<doc id="19726900" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19726900" title="Sophismata">
Sophismata

Sophismata (from the Latin plural of the Greek word σόφισμα, 'sophisma', which also gave rise to the related term "sophism") in medieval philosophy are difficult or puzzling sentences presenting difficulties of logical analysis that must be solved. Sophismata-literature grew in importance during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and many important developments in philosophy (particularly in logic and natural philosophy) occurred as a result of investigation into their logical and semantic properties.
Sophismata are "ambiguous, puzzling or simply difficult sentences" that were used by Medieval logicians for educational purposes and for disputation about logic. Sophismata were written in Latin, and for many of them the meaning is lost, when they get translated to other languages. They can be divided into sentences that:
When in the second half of the 19th century scholastic logic began to decline and be replaced by formal logic, discussions about sophismata and syncategoremata gradually became extinct as the problem posed by them disappeared with the formalisation of the language. Thus, except the Liar paradox sophismata in general are trivially solved by modern analytical philosophy.
Example: All men are donkeys or men and donkeys are donkeys.
All men are donkeys or men and donkeys are donkeys () is a sophisma that was first proposed and solved by the 14th century philosopher Albert of Saxony. Albert of Saxony was a German philosopher known for his contributions to logic and physics, and his solution may have been influenced by the works of his fellow logician Jean Buridan. 
"All men are donkeys or men and donkeys are donkeys" is an example of the second class of sophismata; an ambiguous sentence that is open to more than one interpretation and could be either true or false depending on what interpretation is chosen.
Solving the example.
Solving the sophisma requires understanding the meaning of the sophisma sentence. In order to accomplish this three steps should be taken:
In accordance with step 1, in order to prove that the sophisma "All men are donkeys or men and donkeys are donkeys" is true then it should be viewed as a logical conjunction's sentence that is a two-place logical operator "and". It results "true" if both of its operands are true, otherwise it represents "false". So in this case the sophisma could be interpreted as 
This presents "All men are donkeys or men" as the first logical operand and "donkeys are donkeys" as the second one. Both of the logical operands connected by "and" are true, and therefore the whole sentence is true. The first logical operand is a logical sentence on its own. It is a logical disjunction's sentence that is a two-place logical operator or. It results in a true sentence whenever one or more of its operands are true. "All men are donkeys or men" is true because while the first logical operand "All men are donkeys" is false, the second logical operand or "men" is true. Therefore the whole logical disjunction indicates that the sentence is true. The second logical operand "donkeys are donkeys" is true because donkeys are donkeys.
In accordance with step 1, in order to prove that the sophisma "All men are donkeys or men and donkeys are donkeys" is false then it should be looked at as a logical disjunctions sentence. In this case the sophisma could be interpreted as 
This presents "All men are donkeys" as the first logical operand and "men and donkeys are donkeys" as the second one. Both of the logical operands connected by "or" are false, and therefore the whole sentence is also false. The first logical operand is false because all men are not donkeys. The second logical operand "men and donkeys are donkeys" is a logical conjunction on its own and is also false. This is because although donkeys are donkeys men are not donkeys. Because it is connected by "and" this logical conjunction with one true logical operand and one false indicates that the sentence is false.
In accordance with step 2, Albert of Saxony proposed his own solution of the sophisma that proved it could result in both being truth and being false depending on the interpretation of the ambiguous sentence.
In accordance with step 3, Albert of Saxony did not have to prove this proposed solution because it covered both possible scenarios (being true and being false).

<doc id="19726926" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19726926" title="Ganamurti">
Ganamurti

Ganamurti (pronounced gānamūrti, meaning "the idol of music") is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 3rd "Melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music.
It is called Gānasāmavarāḷi in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 3rd rāgam in the 1st "chakra Indu". The mnemonic name is "Indu-Go". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra ga ma pa dha nu". Its structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras in Carnatic music" for details on below notation and terms):
The notes used in this scale are "shuddha rishabham, shuddha gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, shuddha dhaivatham, kakali nishadham".
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Jhalavarali", which is the 39th "melakarta".
Asampurna Melakarta.
Gānasāmavarāḷi is the 3rd "Melakarta" in the original list compiled by Venkatamakhin. The notes used in the scale are the same, but the ascending scale is different. It is an "shadava-sampurna" raga (6 notes in ascending scale, while full 7 are used in descending scale).
"Janya" rāgams.
"Ganamurti" has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with "Ganamoorti".
Compositions.
"Ganamoorthe sri krishna" by Thyagaraja is a popular composition sung in concerts, set to "Ganamurti".
"Brihadiswara rakshatuma" in "Eka" tala by Muthuswami Dikshitar is a composition set to "Gānasāmavarāḷi" scale.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Ganamurti's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Vishwambari" and "Shamalangi". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.

Plenderleith

Plenderleith is a Scottish feudal Crown barony comprising approximately one half of Oxnam Parish, Roxburghshire, in the vicinity of Kelso, Scottish Borders. The earliest references to the estates of Plenderleith (also known as Plenderlathe, Prendrelathe, Prendrelath, Pendirlath, and Prendirlath) date to 1175, when John de Plenderleith witnessed a charter in lands in Teviotdale during the reign of William the Lion. By the mid-13th century, the lands of Plenderleith were held by Nicholas de Prendrelathe, lay abbott of Jedburgh Abbey. In 1292, the estates passed to his daughter, Johanna, the wife of Sir John Wishart (Wishard/Wischarde/Whyssard/Wyssard).
Sir John was sent by Robert the Bruce and John Comyn, then Guardians of Scotland, in embassy to France in 1302. Upon the Bruce's accession to the throne of Scotland in 1306 as Robert I, he erected the lands of Plenderleith, then held by Sir John's son, William, into a barony, apparently in recognition of this service. When Sir William died, the lands and barony of Plenderleith passed to his daughter, Alicia. She subsequently married Sir George de Abernethy, 4th Baron of Saltoun, who, through the marriage, became Baron of Plenderleith, as well.
In 1346, Edward Balliol, who had usurped the title "King of Scots" with the support of Edward III of England, declared Plenderleith forfeit to the crown as a result of Sir George's support for the Scottish king David II's invasion of England. Sir George had accompanied King David into England, and was captured with the king at the Battle of Neville's Cross. During Sir George's internment in the Tower of London, control of Plenderleith was awarded by Balliol to Sir Walter de Selby. After Sir Walter's death at Lydelle, Edward III proclaimed Sir Walter's son, James de Selby, as heir to his father's rights and titles in Plenderleith. Some time following David II's uncontested return to the Scottish throne in 1357, the barony was restored to Sir George, though as late as 1359, it was reported by Henry Ker, Sheriff of Roxburgh, that the "barony was in the allegiance of England."
The barony remained in the hands of the Abernethys of Saltoun until 1612, when John, 8th Lord Saltoun, conveyed several of his estates, including the lands and barony of Plenderleith, to Sir James Stewart of Killeith, 4th Lord Ochiltree, in order to satisfy debts. Lord Ochiltree, in turn, assigned Plenderleith to John Gordon of Cairnburrow (Lord Rothiemay) in 1617, who passed the barony to Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe in 1620. These assignations were confirmed by James VI. In 1707, John Ker, 5th Earl of Roxburghe, was created 1st Duke of Roxburghe for his services in bringing about the Act of Union of 1707. In 1755, his successor, John Ker, 3rd Duke and Earl of Roxburghe, received a Crown Charter from George II confirming to him the barony of Plenderleith. After Plenderleith had been held by the Earls and Dukes of Roxburghe for over 300 years, the rights and title of Baron of Plenderleith passed by assignation from the Innes-Kers to the Harmons. The current and 31st Baron of Plenderleith is Clifford Harmon of Dallas, Texas, who succeeded to the barony in 2007 following the death of his father. The heir apparent to the barony is Clifford Taylor Harmon IV.
In addition to the 1306 charter erecting the barony, Crown Charters confirming the barony were issued by James II in 1464, Edward IV in 1483, James VI in 1613 and 1620, Charles I in 1635, and George II in 1755. The 1483 charter united the barony of Plenderleith to the barony of Abernethy, though it remained independently recognized in subsequent heirship proceedings and was later formally separated again.

Demographics of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic

This article is about the demographic features of the population of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
In 2001, the NKR's reported population was 95% Armenian, with the remaining total including Russians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Kurds. In March 2007, the local government announced that its population had grown to 138,000. The annual birth rate was recorded at 2,200–2,300 per year, an increase from nearly 1,500 in 1999. Until 2000, the country's net migration was at a negative. For the first half of 2007, 1,010 births and 659 deaths were reported, with a net emigration of 27.
Most of the Armenian population is Christian and belongs to the Armenian Apostolic Church. Certain Orthodox Christian and Evangelical Christian denominations also exist; other religions include Judaism.

Ethnic groups.
The population of the Nagorno-Karabach Republic is now almost exclusively Armenian. Almost all Azerbaijanis (41,000 at the territory of the Nagorno-Karabach AO in 1989) have left the area. The majority of the Russians and Ukrainians have also left. 
The population of the 7 rayons of Azerbaijan not belonging to the Nagorno-Karabach AO (Kalbajar, Lachin, Gubadly, Zangilan, Jabrail, Fuzuli and Aghdam) but now for the most part under control of the Nagorno-Karabach Republic, was 371,441 in 1979, including 363,588 Azerbaijanis and only a small Armenian minority (1,405 or only 0.4%). As the number of Azerbaijanis in the territory under control of the Nagorno-Karabach Republic is now negligible, it can be estimated that as a result of the Nagorno-Karabach War approximately 400,000 Azerbaijanis have left the area.
History.
18th century.
Concrete numbers about the demographic situation in Nagorno Karabakh appear since the 18th century. Archimandrite Minas Tigranian, after completing his secret mission to Persian Armenia ordered by the Russian Tsar Peter the Great stated in a report dated March 14, 1717 that the patriarch of the Gandzasar Monastery, in Nagorno Karabakh, had under his authority 900 Armenian villages.
In his letter of 1769 to Russia’s Count P. Panin, the Georgian king Erekle II, in his description of Nagorno Karabakh, suggests: "Seven families rule the region of Khamse. Its population is totally Armenian." 
When discussing Karabakh and Shusha in the 18th century, the Russian diplomat and historian S. M. Bronevskiy (Russian: С. М. Броневский) indicated in his "Historical Notes" that Karabakh, which he said "is located in Greater Armenia" had as many as 30–40,000 armed Armenian men in 1796.
19th century.
A survey prepared by the Russian imperial authorities in 1823, several years before the 1828 Armenian migration from Persia to the newly established Armenian Province, shows that all Armenians of Karabakh compactly resided in its highland portion, i.e. on the territory of the five traditional Armenian principalities in Nagorno Karabakh, and constituted an absolute demographic majority on those lands. The survey's more than 260 pages recorded that the district of Khachen had twelve Armenian villages and no Tatar (Muslim) villages; Jalapert (Jraberd) had eight Armenian villages and no Tatar villages; Dizak had fourteen Armenian villages and one Tatar village; Gulistan had twelve Armenian and five Tatar villages; and Varanda had twenty-three Armenian villages and one Tatar village.
20th century.
During the Soviet times, the leaders of the Azerbaijan SSR tried to change demographic balance in the Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region (NKAO) by increasing the number of Azerbaijani residents through opening a university with Azerbaijani, Russian and Armenian sectors and a shoe factory, sending Azerbaijanis from other parts of Azerbaijani SSR to the NKAO. "By doing this," Aliyev said in an interview in 2002 "I tried to increase the number of Azeris and to reduce the number of Armenians.”
Nearing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast boasted a population of 145,593 Armenians (76.4%), 42,871 Azerbaijanis (22.4%), and several thousand Kurds, Russians, Greeks, and Assyrians. Most of the Azerbaijani and Kurdish populations fled the region during the heaviest years of fighting in the war from 1992 to 1993. The main language spoken in Nagorno-Karabakh is Armenian; however, Karabakh Armenians speak a dialect of Armenian which is considerably different from that which is spoken in Armenia as it is layered with Russian, Turkish and Persian words.
2000s.
In 2001, the NKR's reported population was 95% Armenian, with the remaining total including Assyrians, Greeks, and Kurds. In March 2007, the local government announced that its population had grown to 138,000. The annual birth rate was recorded at 2,200-2,300 per year, an increase from nearly 1,500 in 1999. Until 2000, the country's net migration was at a negative. For the first half of 2007, 1,010 births and 659 deaths were reported, with a net emigration of 27.
In 2011, officials from YAP submitted a letter to OSCE which included the statement, "The OSCE fact-finding mission report released last year also found that some 15,000 Armenians have been illegally settled on Azerbaijan's occupied territories." However, the OSCE report, released in March 2011, estimates the population of territories controlled by ethnic Armenians "adjacent to the breakaway Azerbaijani region of Nagorno-Karabakh" to be 14,000, and states "there has been no significant growth in the population since 2005."
Most of the Armenian population is Christian and belongs to the Armenian Apostolic Church. Certain Orthodox Christian and Evangelical Christian denominations also exist; other religions include Judaism.
With the turmoil caused by the Syrian Civil War, several hundred Syrian-Armenian citizens have moved from Syria to Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Many of these refugees are being offered assistance by the government in the form of land, housing, extra educational assistance, and other such basics that will help them quickly assimilate and start their new lives. As the civil war continues, many more families are expected to make the move to Nagorno-Karabakh.

Stauffacher

Stauffacher is a tram junction (lines 2, 3, 8, 9, 14) in Aussersihl, Zurich, next to the St. Jakob church, situated along the "Badenerstrasse" between the "Bäcker" and the "Stauffacher" streets.
The tram stop was named after the street, which had been named for Werner Stauffacher in 1893. "Stauffacher" is officially just the name of the tram stop, not the square, and there was formerly a "Stauffacherplatz" some 200 m farther along the street towards the Sihl (named in 1898). Since the name of the tram stop induced common usage to associate "Stauffacherplatz" with the tram stop, leading to confusion with the actual "Stauffacherplatz", the latter was renamed to "Ernst-Nobs-Platz" in 2003. 
St. Jakob was the site of a sick-house outside the town of Zurich and an associated chapel since the 11th century. The first historical mention of the St. Jakob church dates to 1221. It was the site of the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl in 1443. In 1677, the sick-house was transformed into a "Pfrundhaus" (senior citizens' residence), disestablished in 1842. The current St. Jakob church building was inaugurated in 1901.

George Charles Beresford

George Charles Beresford (10 July 1864 – 21 February 1938) was a British studio photographer, originally from Drumlease, Dromahair, County Leitrim.
A member of the Beresford family headed by the Marquess of Waterford and the third of five children, he was the son of Major Henry Marcus Beresford (1835-1895) and Julia Ellen Maunsell (d. 1923). His paternal grandfather was the Most Reverend Marcus Beresford, Archbishop of Armagh, youngest son of the Right Reverend George Beresford, Bishop of Kilmore, second son of John Beresford, second son of Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone.
Beresford was sent to Westward Ho! in 1877 and attended the United Services College. On leaving in 1882 he enrolled at the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, and from there went to India in 1882 as a civil engineer in the Public Works Department. After four years he contracted malaria and returned to England to study art, eventually exhibiting at the Royal Academy.
Between 1902 and 1932 he worked from a studio in Knightsbridge at 20 Yeoman's Row, Brompton Road. Here he produced platinotype portraits of writers, artists and politicians who were celebrities of the time. His images were used in publications such as "The World's Work", "The Sketch", "The Tatler" and "The Illustrated London News". He donated substantially to the Red Cross in World War I and later turned to a very successful dealing in antiques. In 1943 the National Portrait Gallery acquired some of his negatives and prints from his former secretary.
Beresford was a close friend of Augustus John and Sir William Orpen, another Irishman - they produced a number of images of each other.
Kipling's character M'Turk in Stalky & Co. was based on Beresford, whose autobiography "Schooldays with Kipling" appeared in 1936.
Family.
Major Henry Marcus Beresford (2 March 1835 - 5 February 1895) and Julia Ellen Maunsell (died 13 October 1923) were married on 10 April 1861. Their children were:

Rational number

In mathematics, a rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction "p"/"q" of two integers, with the denominator "q" not equal to zero. Since "q" may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number. The set of all rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface Q (or blackboard bold formula_1, Unicode ); it was thus named in 1895 by Peano after "quoziente", Italian for "quotient".
The decimal expansion of a rational number always either terminates after a finite number of digits or begins to repeat the same finite sequence of digits over and over. Moreover, any repeating or terminating decimal represents a rational number. These statements hold true not just for base 10, but also for binary, hexadecimal, or any other integer base.
A real number that is not rational is called irrational. Irrational numbers include square root of 2, π, "e", and "φ". The decimal expansion of an irrational number continues without repeating. Since the set of rational numbers is countable, and the set of real numbers is uncountable, almost all real numbers are irrational.
The rational numbers can be formally defined as the equivalence classes of the quotient set where the cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs ("m","n") where "m" and "n" are integers, "n" is not 0 , and "~" is the equivalence relation defined by if, and only if, 
In abstract algebra, the rational numbers together with certain operations of addition and multiplication form a field. This is the archetypical field of characteristic zero, and is the field of fractions for the ring of integers. Finite extensions of Q are called algebraic number fields, and the algebraic closure of Q is the field of algebraic numbers.
In mathematical analysis, the rational numbers form a dense subset of the real numbers. The real numbers can be constructed from the rational numbers by completion, using Cauchy sequences, Dedekind cuts, or infinite decimals.
Zero divided by any other integer equals zero, therefore zero is a rational number (but division by zero is undefined).
Terminology.
The term "rational" in reference to the set Q refers to the fact that a rational number represents a "ratio" of two integers. In mathematics, the adjective "rational" often means that the underlying field considered is the field Q of rational numbers. Rational polynomial usually, and most correctly, means a polynomial with rational coefficients, also called a "polynomial over the rationals". However, rational function does "not" mean the underlying field is the rational numbers, and a rational algebraic curve is "not" an algebraic curve with rational coefficients.
Arithmetic.
Embedding of integers.
Any integer "n" can be expressed as the rational number "n"/1.
Ordering.
Where both denominators are positive:
If either denominator is negative, the fractions must first be converted into equivalent forms with positive denominators, through the equations:
and 
Addition.
Two fractions are added as follows:
Multiplication.
The rule for multiplication is:
Division.
Where "c" ≠ 0:
Note that division is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor fraction:
Inverse.
Additive and multiplicative inverses exist in the rational numbers:
Exponentiation to integer power.
If "n" is a non-negative integer, then
and (if "a" ≠ 0):
Continued fraction representation.
A finite continued fraction is an expression such as
where "an" are integers. Every rational number "a"/"b" has two closely related expressions as a finite continued fraction, whose coefficients "an" can be determined by applying the Euclidean algorithm to ("a","b").
Formal construction.
Mathematically we may construct the rational numbers as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of integers ("m","n"), with . This space of equivalence classes is the quotient space where if, and only if, We can define addition and multiplication of these pairs with the following rules:
and, if "m"2 ≠ 0, division by
The equivalence relation ("m"1,"n"1) ~ ("m"2,"n"2) if, and only if, is a congruence relation, i.e. it is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above, and we may define Q to be the quotient set i.e. we identify two pairs ("m"1,"n"1) and ("m"2,"n"2) if they are equivalent in the above sense. (This construction can be carried out in any integral domain: see field of fractions.) We denote by [("m"1,"n"1)] the equivalence class containing ("m"1,"n"1). If ("m"1,"n"1) ~ ("m"2,"n"2) then, by definition, ("m"1,"n"1) belongs to [("m"2,"n"2)] and ("m"2,"n"2) belongs to [("m"1,"n"1)]; in this case we can write . Given any equivalence class [("m","n")] there are a countably infinite number of representation, since
The canonical choice for [("m","n")] is chosen so that , i.e. "m" and "n" share no common factors, i.e. "m" and "n" are coprime. For example, we would write [(1,2)] instead of [(2,4)] or [(−12,−24)], even though .
We can also define a total order on Q. Let ∧ be the "and"-symbol and ∨ be the "or"-symbol. We say that if:
The integers may be considered to be rational numbers by the embedding that maps "m" to [("m",1)].
Properties.
The set Q, together with the addition and multiplication operations shown above, forms a field, the field of fractions of the integers Z. 
The rationals are the smallest field with characteristic zero: every other field of characteristic zero contains a copy of Q. The rational numbers are therefore the prime field for characteristic zero.
The algebraic closure of Q, i.e. the field of roots of rational polynomials, is the algebraic numbers.
The set of all rational numbers is countable. Since the set of all real numbers is uncountable, we say that almost all real numbers are irrational, in the sense of Lebesgue measure, i.e. the set of rational numbers is a null set.
The rationals are a densely ordered set: between any two rationals, there sits another one, and, therefore, infinitely many other ones. For example, for any two fractions such that 
(where formula_23 are positive), we have
Any totally ordered set which is countable, dense (in the above sense), and has no least or greatest element is order isomorphic to the rational numbers.
Real numbers and topological properties.
The rationals are a dense subset of the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is that rational numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions as regular continued fractions.
By virtue of their order, the rationals carry an order topology. The rational numbers, as a subspace of the real numbers, also carry a subspace topology. The rational numbers form a metric space by using the absolute difference metric and this yields a third topology on Q. All three topologies coincide and turn the rationals into a topological field. The rational numbers are an important example of a space which is not locally compact. The rationals are characterized topologically as the unique countable metrizable space without isolated points. The space is also totally disconnected. The rational numbers do not form a complete metric space; the real numbers are the completion of Q under the metric above.
"p"-adic numbers.
In addition to the absolute value metric mentioned above, there are other metrics which turn Q into a topological field:
Let "p" be a prime number and for any non-zero integer "a", let , where "pn" is the highest power of "p" dividing "a".
In addition set For any rational number "a"/"b", we set 
Then defines a metric on Q. 
The metric space (Q,"dp") is not complete, and its completion is the "p"-adic number field Q"p". Ostrowski's theorem states that any non-trivial absolute value on the rational numbers Q is equivalent to either the usual real absolute value or a "p"-adic absolute value.

Natakapriya

Natakapriya, (pronounced nāţakapriya, meaning "the one dear to theatre") is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 10th "melakarta" rāgam (parent scale) in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system. According to the Muthuswami Dikshitar school, the 10th melakarta rāgam is called Naţābharanam.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is a "sampoorna" rāgam - rāgam having all 7 "swarams". It is the 4th rāgam in the 2nd "chakra Netra". The mnemonic name is "Netra-Bhu". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra gi ma pa dhi ni". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
The notes used in this scale are "shuddha rishabham, sadharana gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham" and "kaisiki nishadham". "Natakapriya" is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Shadvidamargini", which is the 46th "melakarta" rāgam.
Asampurna Melakarta.
Naţābharanam is the 10th "Melakarta" in the original list compiled by Venkatamakhin. The notes used in the scale are the same, but the scales are "vakra" (zig-zag usage in phrases of the scale). It is an "shadava-sampurna" raga (6 notes in ascending scale, while full 7 are used in descending scale).
"Janya" rāgams.
"Sindhu Bhairavi" is one of the few "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "Janya" rāgams for a full list of its "janyas".
Popular compositions.
Here are some compositions set to this raga.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Natakapriya's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 3 other major "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Vachaspati", "Charukesi" and "Gourimanohari". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For an illustration, refer "Graha bhedam on Vachaspati".

HMS Investigator (1798)

HM Sloop "Investigator" was a survey ship of the Royal Navy. In 1802, under the command of Matthew Flinders, she was the first ship to circumnavigate Australia.
Background.
The ship was built in Sunderland as a collier, and was named "Fram" when launched in 1795. She operated off the north-east coast of England before being purchased by the Royal Navy in 1798. She was then refitted with 22 guns to serve as an escort vessel, and renamed "Xenophon".
Australian voyage.
At the urging of the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, the Admiralty decided to launch an expedition to map the Australian coastline, as well as further study the plant and animal life on the new colony. Attached to the expedition was the botanist Robert Brown,the botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer and the landscape artist William Westall. The "Xenophon" was chosen for the expedition: her former mercantile role meant that she had a small draught and ample space for supplies, making her particularly suitable for a long exploratory voyage. On the other hand, she was in relatively poor condition, and could therefore be spared from service in the war against France.
After a refit/conversion at Deptford dockyard, which included making additional cabins for scientists and space on the deck for plant specimens, she was renamed "Investigator".
On 19 January 1801, the Navy appointed Lieutenant Flinders commander of the "Investigator", and he would arrive to take command on 25 January. He would later write:
Circumnavigation (6 Dec 1801 - 9 June 1803).
The "Investigator" set sail from Spithead for Australia on 18 July 1801, calling at the Cape of Good Hope before crossing the Indian Ocean and sighting Cape Leeuwin off South West Australia on 6 December 1801. The expedition put into King George Sound (Albany) for a month before beginning a running survey of The Great Australian Bight which stretched 2300 kilometres to Spencer Gulf. On 21 February 1802 a tragic accident occurred when a shore party which included Ships Master John Thistle, midshipman William Taylor and six seamen were lost when a boat capsized attempting to return to the ship at dusk in choppy waters. No bodies were recovered. Flinders named the headland Cape Catastrophe. Proceeding into the gulf, Flinders surveyed Port Lincoln (which he named after his home county). Working eastwards "Investigator" next charted Kangaroo Island, Yorke Peninsula and St Vincent Gulf. On 8 April, at Encounter Bay, a surprise meeting with French corvette Géographe under Nicolas Baudin was cordial, the Captains being unaware the Treaty of Amiens had only just been signed and both believed the two countries were still at war with one another. Sailing eastward through Bass Strait, ""Investigator"" visited King Island and Port Philip before arriving at Port Jackson on 9 May 1802. "Investigator" spent the next ten weeks preparing and took aboard 12 new men including an aborigine named Bungaree with whom Flinders had previously sailed with on the sloop "Norfolk". On 22 July she left Port Jackson, sailing north in company with the brig , (which soon proved to be crank and returned to Port Jackson), "Investigator" hugged the east coast, passed through the Great Barrier Reef and transited Torres Strait (which Flinders had previously sailed with Captain William Bligh on HMS "Providence"). While surveying the Gulf of Carpentaria the ship's timbers were examined; the Deptford dockyard refit/conversion had failed to rectify and fix major faults with the ship, and as the voyage to Australia had revealed, she was in poor shape, the wood was rotting and there were serious extensive leaks. The ships carpenter reported that she would not last more than six months.
Flinders sailed to the Dutch settlement in Timor hoping to find a replacement, but was unsuccessful. By now a number of the crew were unwell with numerous diseases such as dysentery and scurvy, so the survey was reluctantly cut short and the ship was forced to sail back to Port Jackson "with all possible sail, day and night", abandoning his desire for a running survey on the north and west coasts of Australia, to undergo repairs. He did, however, complete the circumnavigation of Australia, not without lightening the ship by jettisoning two wrought-iron anchors. These were found and recovered in 1973 by divers at Middle Island, Archipelago of the Recherche, Western Australia. The best bower anchor is on display at the South Australian Maritime Museum while the stream anchor can be seen at the National Museum of Australia. 
"Investigator" reached Port Jackson on 9 June 1803 and, on its return to Sydney, Governor Philip Gidley King requested that a survey of the vessel be carried out:
Flinders left the now decommissioned "Investigator" as a hulk at Port Jackson and attempted to return to England as a passenger aboard HMS "Porpoise".
Later years (1804 - 1872).
In 1804, Governor King of Sydney ordered a survey, which found that the "Investigator" could be repaired and returned to service. The work involved cutting down the front deck and re-rigging the ship, to prepare her for another voyage.
In 1805 "Investigator" sailed back to England, carrying two of Flinders' botanists, Robert Brown and Ferdinand Bauer and their collections. The ship endured several fierce storms en route but arrived safely. She continued in naval service for another few years, but was eventually sold to be broken up in November 1810, a "noble, hard-working ship which did not deserve this fate".
In fact, the "Investigator" was not broken up, but rebuilt as a commercial sailing vessel, brig or snow rigged, and reverted to her former naval name "Xenophon." As such she continued to sail extensively around the globe until putting into Geelong on 30 July 1853 during the Australian gold rushes with a cargo of timber and other goods from Liverpool. The vessel later continued on to Melbourne, where she was sold and was converted into a storage hulk. Reregistered in Melbourne in 1861 as a hulk of 367 tons, 101.5 x 28.2 x 18.9 ft. depth of hold, the last change of ownership was in 1868 and the register was closed with the comment 'broken up' in 1872.

Tallebudgera Creek

Tallebudgera Creek is a large creek on the Gold Coast which runs from the Springbrook Plateau in the west through Tallebudgera Valley to the southern slopes of Burleigh Mountain at Burleigh Heads and the Pacific Ocean in the east. Its water catchment is narrow at about 30 km in length. 
Tallebudgera Creek is known for good fishing, and its name even translates in indigenous language to "good fishing". Bream, flathead, whiting and the bull shark are common species that are found in the creek.
As well as the main creek there is an extensive canal system, whose shores boast some of the Gold Coast's best housing. It is one of the Gold Coast's three main canal and creek systems, alongside the slightly smaller Currumbin Creek to the south and the much larger Nerang River to the north.
History.
The first bridge across the creek was opened in 1926. The road was then known as Main Ocean Road, later to be upgraded to the Pacific Highway.
The Tallebudgera Creek Dam was constructed on the creek in the 1950s.

Nikodim Milaš

Nikodim Milaš (1845–1915) was a Serbian Orthodox Church bishop in Dalmatia (nowaday Croatia). He was a writer and perhaps the greatest Serbian expert on church law and the Slavic world.. As a canon lawyer in Dalmatia, he defended the Serbian Orthodox Church against the State. He was a polyglot, fluent in German, Italian, Latin, Russian, Greek, and Old Slavonic, and an author of numerous books.
Biography.
Bishop Nikodim Milaš was born at Šibenik in Dalmatia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on the 4th of April 1845 to Trifun and Maria Milaš (Serbian father and Italian mother). He was baptized Nikola. After attending the Jesuit Gymnasium in Zadar and graduating from the Serbian Orthodox Theological School at Sremski Karlovci, he studied at the oldest college of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Kievan Theological Academy and Seminary (then part of Imperial Russia), and in 1871 took a Master's degree in Canon Law and Church History, the fruit of which, his remarkable dissertation, "Nomocanon of Patriarch Photius", brought him the golden cross of the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon his return home, Serbian Orthodox Bishop Stefan (Knežević) of Dalmatia appointed him professor of canon law at Zadar's Theological Orthodox Institute. In 1872, he published a study in which he criticized the Austro-Hungarian government for interfering in the life of the Serbian Orthodox Church and its faithful. 
Professor Nikola Milaš was tonsured in 1873 and given the monastic name of Nikodim. Also, he was ordained deacon, and two years later, presbyter. He received the rank archimandrite in 1880. Under his administration the theological institute in Zadar became one of the best Orthodox schools. Nikodim corresponded with the greatest Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic canonists at the time: Alexis Stepanovich Pavloff (d. 1898), Alexander Theodorovich Lavroff, Vasili Vasilievich Bolotoff, Pietro Gasparri, Emil Albert Friedberg, Joseph Putzer, Friedrich Heinrich Vering. After the publication of his (hornbook), ""Principles of Jurisdiction in the Eastern Orthodox Church,"" in which he again levelled criticism on the Austro-Hungarian authorities, he was forced to take refuge in Belgrade in late 1885. There for the next two years, he was the rector of the Belgrade Seminary ("Bogoslovija"). In early 1888 he was back in Zadar where he completed that same year two major works: ""Roman Catholic Propaganda: its foundation and rules today"" (1889) and his six-volume treatise on the Serbian Orthodox Church entitled ""Orthodox Church and Canon Law"" (1890). He liked Zadar, and the people would habe been glad to keep him; but the attraction of a Belgrade post carried him back there in the autumn of 1888. He was appointed Professor of Canon law and Church History at the Belgrade's Grande école ("Velika škola") and Bogoslovija (Theological Seminary). Two years later, when Bishop Stefan Knezević of Dalmatia died, Nikodim was elected Bishop of Dalmatia on the 10th of July 1890 and consecrated on the 16th of September 1890. Throughout his tenure he was under pressure from anti-Serb Orthodox authorities and forced to endure aggressive Roman Catholic proselytism. Bishop Nikodim collaborated with politician Sava Bjelanović during that difficult period. He once wrote:
""Nije lak posao vladici u Dalmaciji i sa takozvanom pravoslavnom inteligencijom. Ovi i ovakvi ljudi prinudili su dalmatinske episkope Rajačića, Živkovića i Mutibarića da bježe iz Dalmacije u druge eparhije. ... Ali najteže je dalmatinskom episkopu sa Vladom, ako hoće da bude pravi pravoslavni episkop i čuvar vjere i crkve svoje. U Austriji od 1868. vlada zakon da pravoslavlje uživa jednaka prava kao i sve ostale priznate državne konfesije. Ali u samoj stvari ta je crkva u Austriji samo tolerirana.""
"The bishop's job in Dalmatia is not an easy one and with a so-called Orthodox intelligentsia (many of whom were Roman Catholic, though declared themselves as Serbs). Those and like folk have caused Dalmatian bishops such as Josif Rajačić, Pantelejmon Živković and Jerotije Mutibarić to flee from Dalmatia and seek refuge in other diocese... But what is really difficult for a bishop is to deal with State officials, if he wants to be a true Orthodox bishop and defender of his faith and church. In Austria there is a rule since 1868 that Orthodoxy has the same position as all other confessions in the State. But the truth of the matter is that the Church (Orthodox) is just tolerated."
In 1901 Nikodim published ""Orthodoxy in Dalmatia"" in answer to a papal encyclical in which Pope Leo XIII appealed for union. His book was criticized by the bishop of the Eparchy of Križevci, who wrote:
"Nobody hates Union as much as Orthodox Dalmatians (meaning Serbs)."
Nikodim also had problems with his superiors. He refused elevation to the Holy Synod (the executive body of the Serbian Orthodox Church) of Belgrade and later of Sarajevo because he was not elected according to canon law. Always under constant pressure from civil authorities and other enemies, Nikodim was forced to retire in early 1912. He was succeeded by Bishop Dimitrije Branković.
Bishop Nikodim died at Dubrovnik on the 12th of April 1915. The only copy of his new book -- ""The Church and the State in the Austro-Hungarian Empire"" -- has since disappeared.
Legacy.
Nikodim Milaš grew up in a region where jurisprudence was founded on Roman and Byzantine law. His extensive and exact legal erudition, and the skill he wrote the complex canonical laws, soon brought him a reputation never before equalled, and caused him to be universally recognized as the greatest Eastern Orthodox canon lawyer of his day. Most of his work was translated into Russian, German, Romanian, Bulgarian and Greek, and has greatly influenced modern Orthodox canonists, including I. Bogović, C. Metrović, Professor S. Troitsky (the Russian-Serbian canonist), Branko Cisarž (d. 1982), and Dimsho Perić (d. 2007), who wrote studies on the history of church-state relations in Serbia. Nikodim produced a number of collections of canonical texts, and was particularly interested in the churches of North Africa in the Roman period. He translated "The Constitution (Syntagma) of the Divine and Sacred Canons" by Rallis and Potlis, and placed his commentaries in the context of previous Biblical hermeneutic works. He had a good deal to say about Church-State relations, a subject which preoccupied most of his life.

XYZ file format

The XYZ file format is a chemical file format. There is no formal standard and several variations exist, but a typical XYZ format specifies the molecule geometry by giving the number of atoms with Cartesian coordinates that will be read on the first line, a comment on the second, and the lines of atomic coordinates in the following lines. The file format is used in computational chemistry programs for importing and exporting geometries. The units are generally in ångströms. Some variations include using atomic numbers instead of atomic symbols, or skipping the comment line. Files using the XYZ format conventionally have the codice_1 extension.
Format.
The formatting of the .xyz file format is as follows:
codice_2
Example.
The methane molecule can be described in the XYZ format by the following:
Animation.
Most molecule viewers such as Jmol and VMD can show animations using .xyz files. The following is an example xyz format for m successive snapshot which can be rendered as an animation:
codice_3
Note that the xyz standard does not require that the number or chemical nature of atoms should be the same at subsequent snapshots, which allows for atoms disappearing from or coming into the field of view during the animation.

Margaret Kelly Leibovici

Margaret "Miss Bluebell" Kelly Leibovici (24 June 1910 – 11 September 2004), Irish dancer, was the founder of the "Bluebell Girls".
Biography.
Margaret Kelly was born in Dublin on 24 June 1910 at the Rotunda Hospital. She never knew her parents. An Irish priest entrusted her to Mary Murphy, a spinster who worked at home as a dressmaker. In 1916, following the Easter uprising, both moved to Liverpool, where, on the direction of a doctor, Kelly was registered in a dance class to strengthen her frail legs. Quickly, it appeared that she had a great talent.
Career.
At the age of fourteen, Kelly left school and joined a Scottish dance troupe, the Hot Jocks. Nine months later Alfred Jackson, a famous producer who ran teams of precision dancers, the Jackson Girls engaged her at the Scala in Berlin. Kelly danced there for 5 years.
In 1930 Kelly danced in Paris at the Folies Bergère and, decided to remain there. In 1932, when she was 22, she created there her own group called the Bluebell Girls, they are still dancing today in the Lido in Paris. This is an unmatched world record of longevity in the history of show business.
In 1939, she married Marcel Leibovici, a Romanian Jew, pianist and composer at the Folies Bergère. During the Second World War, they had two sons: Patrick (1939) and Francis (1941). After the German invasion of 1940, Margaret, pregnant with Francis, was arrested by the French police and interned in Besançon. The Irish chargé d'affaires, Count O'Kelly, saved her. But in 1942, Marcel, her husband, was arrested in his turn and deported to the camp of Gurs. The French Resistance helped him to flee and go back to Paris. He was hidden by his wife opposite the Prefecture of Police building until the Liberation. During this time, Margaret ensured him food and security at the risk of her life. She was interrogated by the Gestapo, which suspected her of hiding her husband, but succeeded, in spite of intensive questioning, to never give herself away thanks to her self-control and her quickness at repartee. François Truffaut's film, "The Last Metro", is inspired by this episode in the life of Margaret Kelly and her husband Marcel Leibovici.
After the war, Margaret started a very fruitful collaboration with Donn Arden, the American choreographer and producer, to give shows at the Paris Lido. While beginning with a modest contract in 1947, the Bluebell Girls became the sole stars of the Lido shows and became increasingly more famous. Their shows were different from the others; Bluebell had an inventory of the tallest and most beautiful dancers who, with their costumes and high heels, towered over everybody on stage. Donn Arden's shows differentiated themselves from the others by the mixture of movement, colour, music and light in a kaleidoscope of impetuous rhythm. By the end of the 1950s, the Bluebell Girls had also really become a worldwide organization. Their base in Paris was supplemented by what had become permanent troupes, for example in Las Vegas, while at any moment, in any part of the world — Europe, Africa, the Far East — the Bluebell Girls appeared in the schedule of the tours. From 1974, the two shows at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, "Hallelujah Hollywood" and "Jubilee!" carried the troupe to the height of its fame.
From 1947, Marcel Leibovici (1919 - 1989) had entered in full partnership with his wife, running the orchestrations, business and financial side of her operation and, thanks to his considerable flair, had made the Bluebell Girls the most celebrated and prestigious dancing troupe in the world. Marcel died in a car accident in 1961. The disappearance of the motive force behind its commercial success could have marked the end of the Bluebell Girls. Nevertheless Bluebell had become wholly responsible for the four children: Patrick, Francis, Florence and Jean-Paul, never married again and kept the Bluebell's programme going and even increased the number of her troupes and her activities, by always adding new elements and new artists. One of the most famous innovations was the introduction of the "topless" in 1970. Miss Bluebell invented the untouchable «showgirl», the accomplished woman and very versatile artist, aware of being the member of a disciplined, rigorous and perfectionist troupe.
She refused the beautiful but insipid dancer, preferring the girl with a character, capable of expressing what was unique in her.
Later life.
In 1984, Bluebell went into semi-retirement and left the Paris Lido, but she continued her global activities, particularly in Las Vegas with the MGM Grand Hotel. The Paris Lido bought her brand name Bluebell Girls to be allowed to continue its use in the shows.
Miss Bluebell devoted a lot of her time and money for charities, but she was also known from her exemplary attitude towards her handicapped granddaughter Alexandra (Angelman Syndrome). Bluebell had the very therapeutic attitude not to exclude her, but to invite her every weekend to the very posh restaurants and to have her admitted by her professional and social circle of acquaintances.
Awards and tributes.
Margaret Kelly was decorated Officer of the British Empire, Chevalier of the Legion of Honour for 72 years of professional activity as maîtresse de ballet, Chevalier des Arts et Lettres and Chevalier de l'Ordre National du Mérite.
In 1986 the BBC broadcast a major drama series called "Bluebell" produced by Richard Bates and George Perry wrote her authorized biography. Carolyn Pickles played her part. Both biography and BBC drama series were a global success, with the sole exception of France where there has been neither a broadcasting of the drama series nor a publishing of the biography.
Within the framework of its mission to present the history of entertainment, the University of Nevada in Las Vegas (UNLV) is paying a permanent tribute to Miss Bluebell by showing photographs of her in its on-line exhibit of photos SHOWGIRLS and in the famous Donn Arden Special Collection, thus reuniting for ever the two partners who played such a signature role in the history of show business and contributed so much to the legend of the Bluebell Girls.
In 1987, the British sculptor Doreen Kern realized Miss Bluebell's life-size bronze portrait bust, it was placed on her tomb (and stolen on 18 July 2008)..
In 1990, Bluebell was granted a private audience by Pope John Paul II.
Last years.
The eight last years (1996–2004) of Miss Bluebell's life were darkened by a conflict between her children relating to the assumption of her responsibility and managing her estate. In 1996, she was placed under French guardianship and she obtained the assurance to remain in her Parisian apartment according to her wish and to continue to be followed by the best medical specialists in Paris.
She is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery. Her son Jean-Paul, who died in 1996, is interred with her.

Maha Sura Singhanat

Somdet Phra Bawornrajchao Maha Sura Singhanat () (1744–1803) was the younger brother of Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the Chakri dynasty of Siam. As an Ayutthayan general, he fought alongside his brother in various campaigns against Burmese invaders and the local warlords. When his brother crowned himself as the king of Siam at Bangkok in 1781, he was appointed the Front Palace or Maha Uparaj, the title of the heir. During the reign of his brother, he was known for his important role in the campaigns against Bodawpaya of Burma.
Early life.
Bunma was born in 1744 to Thongdee and Daoreung. His father Thongdee was the Royal Secretary of Northern Siam and Keeper of Royal Seal. As a son of aristrocrat, he entered the palace and began his aristocratic life as a royal page. Thongdee was a descendant of Kosa Pan, the leader of Siamese mission to France in the seventeenth century. Bunma had four other siblings and two other half-siblings. Bunma himself was the youngest born to Daoreung.
Campaigns against the Burmese.
In 1767, Ayutthaya was about to fall. Bunma fled the city with a small carrack to join the rest of his family at Amphawa, Samut Songkram. His brother the Luang Yokbat of Ratchaburi suggested that he should join Taksin's forces at Chonburi.
After the fall of Ayutthaya, the city and peripheral areas were under the control of the Burmese, while local Siamese nobles established their own states. In 1768, Taksin recaptured Ayutthaya and repelled the Burmese. After the establishment of Thonburi and coronation of Taksin, Bunma was appointed Phra Maha Montri (Royal Police of the Right).
In the same year the two brothers joined the forces against Lord Pimai of Korat. After the campaign he was raised to "Phraya" Anuchitraja Anuchitraja waged several fightings to repel Burmese invasions. In 1770, after the defeat of Lord Fang, Anuchitraja became "Chao Phraya" Surasi - the ruler of Pitsanulok and defender of northern frontiers. In 1771, Surasi joined Phraya Pichai in his legendary fighting that broke his sword. "Chao Phraya" Surasi was known for his ruthlessness in wars that the Burmese gave him the epithet "Tiger Lord". In 1774, Phraya Surasi and his brother was assigned the mission of the capture of Lanna from the Burmese. With the help of Prince Kawila of Lampang, the Siamese forces were able to take Chiangmai. Surasi then took Kawila's sister, Sri Anocha, as his principal wife.
During 1771 - 1781, Surasi joined his brother in massive campaigns subjugating the Laotian kingdoms of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Champasak, and Cambodia. In 1781, Taksin fell ill and a rebellion sprang out to depose the king. His brother the Somdet Chao Phraya Maha Kshatriyaseuk returned to Bangkok to undo the rebellion. Maha Kshatriyaseuk then crowned himself as Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke and moved the capital to the left bank of Chao Phraya river - modern Bangkok. Surasi, as Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke's right hand, was appointed the Front Palace or heir to the throne.
The Front Palace.
Maha Sura Singhanat pioneered the construction of the Front Palace. In 1785, the Burmese king Bodawpaya launched the massive invasions of Siam in the Nine Armies War. Maha Sura Singhanat led the Siamese forces to receive the Burmese attacks coming from the west and south. He strategically defeated the superior Burmese armies and forced Bodawpaya to retreat. Next year in 1786, Bodawpaya came again and encamped his armies at Ta Din Daeng. Maha Sura Singhanat then inflicted the fatal blow to the Burmese and forced them to retreat for the second time.
In 1802, the Burmese invaded Chiangmai. Buddha Yodfa Chulalok sent his brother to relieve the siege on Chiangmai. However, Maha Sura Singhanat fell ill on the course of journey but dispatched his troops to Chiangmai in substitution. Buddha Yodfa Chulalok, upon hearing about the illness of his brother, then sent his nephew Anurak Devesh the "Rear Palace" to get Chiangmai. But the Front Palace forces took Chiangmai beforehand and complained Royal Palace forces' inefficiency. This stirred the conflicts between militarymen of the two palaces.
Death.
In 1803, Maha Sura Singhanat fell ill seriously. However, as recorded by Princess Kampushchat, Maha Sura Singhanat's daughter with his Cambodian concubine, the Front Palace officials blocked the Royal Palace forces from entering the Front Palace as Buddha Yodfa Chulalok came to take care of his brother. Maha Sura Singhanat also expressed his will that the treasures of the Front Palace should be inherited only by his own descendants. Maha Sura Singhanat finally died in 1803.

Philipp Hirschfeld

Philipp Hirschfeld (born 1 October 1840 in Königsberg, Prussia; died 4 October 1896 in Wannsee, Berlin) was a German chess player and theoretician.
Hirschfeld came from an affluent background. He learned the game as a child in Königsberg, and by the time he went to Berlin in 1859 to study, he was already a very strong player and theoretician. He was in the editorial department of the Deutschen Schachzeitung, where he published analysis of opening theory. During his time in Berlin, he played matches with Carl Mayet and Berthold Suhle (+0 -7 = 2) in 1860, and with Adolf Anderssen (+10, -14, =5) and Gustav Neumann in 1861. 
In 1863 Hirschfeld finished his studies and joined his father's business. In London, he founded the Königsberg Tea Company, with branches in Königsberg, Moscow and China. Hirschfeld's profession left him no time for international tournaments, but on his business trips he met up with the best players of his time and occasionally contested matches with them. In 1865 he drew a match with Ignaz von Kolisch in Paris 4-4 (+4, -4, =0), and in 1865 he lost a match Moscow against Prince Sergei Urusov 2-3 (+1, -2, =2). Hirschfeld also played individual games against Wilhelm Steinitz, Johann Jacob Löwenthal, Bernhard Horwitz and Cecil De Vere. In 1873 he took up permanent residence in London, where he was a frequent analysis partner of Johannes Zukertort. From that time he regularly lived a few months of the year in Berlin. He died in 1896 in Wannsee, Berlin.
According to the chessmetrics website, his best historical Elo rating was 2600, which he attained in October 1864. Between 1862 and 1866 he was ranked 4th in the world.

Nicole Matthews

Nicole Matthews (born January 15, 1987) is a Canadian professional wrestler. Matthews wrestles for Shimmer Women Athletes and among other independent promotions, and regularly teams with fellow Canadian wrestler Portia Perez as the Canadian NINJAs, who are former two-time Shimmer Tag Team Champions.
Professional wrestling career.
SuperGirls.
Matthews was originally convinced to try a career in professional wrestling by her friend, male wrestler Sid Sylum. She made her professional wrestling debut in February 2006 alongside fellow trainee Veronika Vice. In March and September 2006, Matthews began wrestling for SuperGirls Wrestling, part of . On October 27, 2007, she defeated Nattie Neidhart and Vice in a three-way match for the SuperGirls Championship. She defended the championship against Vice and Aurora in the following weeks. Vice, however, defeated Matthews for the title on April 21, 2007. During this time, Matthews also formed a partnership with Sid Sylum, wrestling with him in mixed tag team matches and occasionally acting as his valet. Matthews continued to feud with Vice for the remainder of the year. In March 2008, Matthews regained the SuperGirls Championship in a match against Penni Lane. She, however, lost the title to Veronika Vice on February 7, 2009.
On October 29, 2010, Matthews defeated Tenille Tayla in a Tables match to win the SuperGirls Championship for the third time. She lost the title nearly a year later, on October 28, 2011, to KC Spinelli. In early 2012, Matthews formed a new stable known as The Riot in ECCW, alongside Ravenous Randy Myers, Alex Plexis and Andy "The Dreadful" Bird.
Shimmer Women Athletes.
Matthews sent a demo tape to Shimmer Women Athletes in December 2006, but was not signed to the promotion. In October 2007, however, Matthews was called to join the company when Portia Perez needed a tag team partner. Matthews teamed with Perez in Shimmer Volumes 15 and 16. After three singles matches with Shimmer, Matthews once again began teaming with Perez as the Canadian NINJAs (National International Nation of Jalapeño Awesomeness). On October 19, 2008 on Volume 22, the NINJAs challenged Ashley Lane and Nevaeh for the Shimmer Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful. On Volume 23, taped on May 2, 2009, she fought Daizee Haze to a 20 minute time limit draw, before losing to her in a rematch on Volume 24. On May 3, 2009, at the tapings of Volume 26, Matthews and Perez defeated Ashley Lane and Nevaeh to win the Shimmer Tag Team Championship. On November 8, 2009 Matthews came back as a singles competitor by losing to Cheerleader Melissa as part of Volume 27, but winning against Allison Danger as part of Volume 28. After a reign of 692 days, Matthews and Perez lost the Shimmer Tag Team Championship to Hiroyo Matsumoto and Misaki Ohata on March 26, 2011.
On October 2, 2011, the Ninjas failed in their attempt to win back the championship, losing to Ayumi Kurihara and Ayako Hamada, but later that evening, Matthews attacked Cheerleader Melissa from behind after Melissa had won the Shimmer Championship from Madison Eagles. As a result, Matthews received a championship match against Melissa on March 17, 2012, at the Volume 45 tapings but was unsuccessful. The following night, at the tapings of Volume 48, The NINJAs participated in a four-way elimination tag team match, but were the final team eliminated by Courtney Rush and Sara Del Rey, who won the Shimmer Tag Team Championship. On July 7, The NINJAs defeated Rush and Del Rey at an NCW Femmes Fatales (NCW FF) event to win the Shimmer Tag Team Championship for the second time. They lost the title to the Global Green Gangsters (Kellie Skater and Tomoka Nakagawa) on April 14, 2013, at the tapings of Volume 57.
Other promotions.
On May 30, 2010 it was announced that Matthews was to make her debut for NCW Femmes Fatales (NCW FF) as a participant in the tournament to declare the first ever NCW FF Champion, replacing the injured Kacey Diamond in a match against Cheerleader Melissa. Matthews, however, wasn't able to get the win in her debut on June 5, and Melissa advanced to the semi-finals. She continued to compete for NCW FF, facing wrestlers including Mercedes Martinez in singles competition, while continuing to team with Perez.
In early 2009 Matthews took part in the first season tapings of Wrestlicious, which began airing in March 2010.

Arthington railway station served the village of Arthington in the English county of West Yorkshire, near the North Yorkshire town of Harrogate.
History.
Opened by the Leeds Northern Railway, as part of the North Eastern Railway it was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, closing under that management.
The site today.
There have been two stations at Arthington. The original, which open in 1849, was sited south of the main road (Arthington Lane) near to the Wharfedale Inn. The second station was built to serve the Otley branch which opened in 1865, superseded the first station. 
The former station is now a private residence. The two sides of the railway triangle that lay to the north of the station have been dismantled (closed 22 March 1965). Trains still pass the eastern part of the triangle on the Harrogate Line.

Tyrannophryne pugnax is a species of deep-sea anglerfish in the dreamer family, Oneirodidae. It is the sole member of its genus. Like other oneirodids, "T. pugnax" is a bathypelagic fish with a bioluminescent lure. It is known only from two adolescent female specimens, one caught in 1928 near Tahiti-Rarotonga, and the other in 1956 northwest of Bikini Atoll.
The most distinctive feature of "T. pugnax" is its extremely long lower jaw, the joint of which extends backwards well past the base of the pectoral fin. The body of the fish is relatively slender, naked, and entirely black in color. The tail fin has unpigmented rays and is covered by dark skin for some distance past its base. The sphenotic spines (above the eyes) and symphysial spine (at the tip of the jaw) are present.

Three Little Dreams

Three Little Dreams is a wordless picture book illustrated by Thomas Aquinas Maguire, published in July 2010 by Simply Read Books in Vancouver Canada.
Description.
This is a boxed set of three separate books. The set of three books cover three different characters and their dreams. The dreams are entitled "Of Night and Of Flight", "Of Dragons and Drowse" and "Of Sheep and of Sleep". The books unfold in an accordion style and when completely unfurled present themselves as a single polyptych image. The sequence in the stories is flowing and represents the passage of time and single moments concurrently.
The books are cyclical and end where they begin, thus blurring the line between dream and reality.
"Of Night and Of Flight"
This dream features a bird who wakes up and strangely has human arms and hands. He is a piano player but he dreams of being a real bird with real wings. In his dream he sprouts wings, falls asleep and wakes up to find that he has hands again.
"Of Dragons and Drowse"
This dream features a young boy asleep on the couch - he awakes to a strange cat-like red dragon flying by the window. He crawls out of his window onto the tail of the beast. The dragon delivers him home and he slowly floats back onto the couch.
"Of Sleep and of Sheep"
In this story the moon morphs into a sheep who climbs into a girls window - the sheep gives her some wool and she immediately falls asleep. The sheep then climbs out of the window and, in subsequent pages, morphs back into the moon.

Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos

The Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos are located in Santa Cruz department in eastern Bolivia. Six of these former missions (all now secular municipalities) collectively were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990. Distinguished by a unique fusion of European and Amerindian cultural influences, the missions were founded as reductions or "reducciones de indios" by Jesuits in the 17th and 18th centuries to convert local tribes to Christianity.
The interior region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America was largely unexplored at the end of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored and founded eleven settlements in 76 years in the remote Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on the frontier of Spanish America. They built churches ("templos") in a unique and distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of the missions were taught European music as a means of conversion. The missions were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, and virtually autonomous from the Spanish crown.
After the expulsion of the Jesuit order from Spanish territories in 1767, most Jesuit reductions in South America were abandoned and fell into ruins. The former Jesuit missions of Chiquitos are unique because these settlements and their associated culture have survived largely intact.
A large restoration project of the missionary churches began with the arrival of the former Swiss Jesuit and architect Hans Roth in 1972. Since 1990, these former Jesuit missions have experienced some measure of popularity, and have become a tourist destination. A popular biennial international musical festival put on by the nonprofit organization Asociación Pro Arte y Cultura along with other cultural activities within the mission towns, contribute to the popularity of these settlements.
Location.
The six World Heritage Site settlements are located in the hot and semiarid lowlands of Santa Cruz Department of eastern Bolivia. They lie in an area near the Gran Chaco, east and northeast of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, between the Paraguay and Guapay rivers.
The westernmost missions are San Xavier (also known as San Javier) and Concepción, located in the province of Ñuflo de Chávez between the San Julián and Urugayito rivers. Santa Ana de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, and San Rafael de Velasco are located to the east, in José Miguel de Velasco province, near the Brazilian border. San José de Chiquitos is located in Chiquitos province, about south of San Rafael.
Three other former Jesuit missions – San Juan Bautista (now in ruins), Santo Corazón and Santiago de Chiquitos – which have not been named UNESCO heritage sites  – lie east of San José de Chiquitos not far from the town of Roboré. The capital of José Miguel de Velasco Province, San Ignacio de Velasco was founded as a Jesuit mission but also is not a World Heritage Site as the current church is a reconstruction, not a restoration.
Name “Chiquitos”.
Ñuflo de Cháves, a 16th-century Spanish conquistador and founder of Santa Cruz "la Vieja", introduced the name "Chiquitos", or "little ones". It referred to the small doors of the straw houses in which the indigenous population lived. "Chiquitos" has since been used incorrectly both to denote people of the largest ethnic group in the area (correctly known as Chiquitano), and collectively to denote the more than 40 ethnic groups with different languages and cultures living in the region known as the Chiquitania.
Properly, “Chiquitos” refers only to either a modern-day department of Bolivia, or the former region of Upper Peru (now Bolivia) that once encompassed all of the Chiquitania and parts of Mojos (or Moxos) and the Gran Chaco.
The current provincial division of Santa Cruz department does not follow the Jesuits’ concept of a missionary area. The Chiquitania lies within five modern provinces: Ángel Sandoval, Germán Busch, José Miguel de Velasco, Ñuflo de Chávez and Chiquitos province.
History.
In the 16th century, priests of different religious orders set out to evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. Two of these missionary orders were the Franciscans and the Jesuits, both of which eventually arrived in the frontier town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra and then in the Chiquitania. The missionaries employed the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy sprang from the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, who had to be protected and guided by European missionaries so as not to succumb to sin. Reductions generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European lifestyles and values; this was not the case in the Jesuit reductions, however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.
Arrival in the Viceroyalty of Peru.
With the permission of King Philip II of Spain a group of Jesuits travelled to the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1568, some 30 years after the arrival of the Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians and Mercedarians. The Jesuits established themselves in Lima in 1569 before moving east toward Paraguay; in 1572 they reached the Audience of Charcas in modern-day Bolivia. Because they were not allowed to establish settlements on the frontier they built chapter houses, churches and schools in pre-existing settlements, such as La Paz, Potosí and La Plata (present day Sucre).
In 1587 the first Jesuits, Fr. Diego Samaniego and Fr. Diego Martínez, arrived in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, located just south of where the future mission of San José de Chiquitos would be established. In 1592 the settlement had to be moved west because of conflicts with natives, although the remains of the original town exist in the "Santa Cruz la Vieja" archaeological site. The Jesuits did not start missions in the valleys northeast of the "cordillera" until the 17th century. The two central areas for their activities were Moxos, situated in the department of Beni, and the Chiquitania (then simply Chiquitos) in the department of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. In 1682, Fr. Cipriano Barace founded the first of the Jesuit reductions in Moxos, located at Loreto.
The Jesuits in the Chiquitania.
While the mission towns in Paraguay flourished, the evangelization of the Guaraní proved difficult. With encouragement from Agustín Gutiérrez de Arce, the governor of Santa Cruz, the Jesuits focused their efforts on the Chiquitania, where the Christian doctrine was more readily accepted. Between 1691 and 1760 eleven missions were founded in the area; however, fires, floods, plagues, famines and attacks by hostile tribes or slave traders caused many missions to be re-established or rebuilt. The Chiquitos missions were spared large-scale epidemics, unlike those in Paraguay, mainly because of their remote locations and the lack of transportation infrastructure.
The first Jesuit reduction in the Chiquitania was the mission of San Francisco Xavier, founded in 1691 by the Jesuit priest Fr. José de Arce. In September 1691, de Arce and Br. Antonio de Rivas intended to meet seven other Jesuits at the Paraguay River to establish a connection between Paraguay and Chiquitos. However, the beginning of the rainy season brought bad weather, and Arce and his companion only got as far as the first native village. The local Piñoca tribe, who were suffering from a plague, begged Arce and Rivas to stay and promised to build a house and a church for the Jesuits, which were finished by the end of year. The mission was later moved a number of times until 1708 when it was established in its present location.
Ten more missions were founded in the Chiquitania by the Jesuits in three periods: the 1690s, the 1720s, and after 1748. In the 1690s, five missions were established: San Rafael de Velasco (1696), San José de Chiquitos (1698), Concepción (1699) and San Juan Bautista (1699). San Juan Bautista is not part of the World Heritage Site, and only the ruins of a stone tower survive near the present village of (San Juan de) Taperas.
The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) caused a shortage of missionaries and instability in the reductions, so no new missions were built during this period. By 1718 San Rafael was the largest of the Chiquitos missions, and with 2,615 inhabitants could not sustain a growing population. In 1721 the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suárez and Fr. Francisco Hervás established a split-off of the San Rafael mission, the mission of San Miguel de Velasco. To the south, San Ignacio de Zamucos was founded in 1724 but abandoned in 1745; today nothing remains of the mission.
A third period of mission foundations began in 1748 with the establishment of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a part of the World Heritage Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the World Heritage Site group) – of the second Jesuit "templo" built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the mission of Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise is not part of the World Heritage Site group. In 1755 the mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six World Heritage Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.
The Jesuits in the Chiquitania had a secondary objective, which was to secure a more direct route to Asunción than the road then being used via Tucumán and Tarija to link the Chiquitania with the Jesuit missions in Paraguay. The missionaries in Chiquitos founded their settlements increasingly further east, towards the Paraguay River, while those south of Asunción moved closer to the Paraguay River by establishing their missions increasingly farther north, thereby avoiding the impassable Chaco region. Although Ñuflo de Chávez had attempted a route through the Chaco on an expedition as early as 1564, subsequent Jesuit explorations from Chiquitos (e.g. in 1690, 1702, 1703, and 1705) were unsuccessful. The Jesuits were stopped by the hostile Payaguá and Guaycuru tribes, and by the impenetrable swamps of Jarayes. In 1715, de Arce, the co-founder of the first mission in San Xavier, set out from Asunción on the Paraguay River with the Flemish priest Fr. Bartolomé Blende. Payaguá warriors killed Blende during the journey, but de Arce struggled on to reach San Rafael de Velasco in the Chiquitania. On the return trip to Asunción he too was killed in Paraguay. Not until 1767, when the missions had encroached sufficiently on the hostile region and just before the Jesuits were expelled from the New World, did Fr. José Sánchez Labrador manage to travel from Belén in Paraguay to Santo Corazón, the easternmost Chiquitos mission.
Expulsion and recent development.
In 1750 as a result of the Treaty of Madrid seven missions in present-day Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil were transferred from Spanish to Portuguese control. The native Guaraní tribes were unhappy to see their lands turned over to Portugal (their enemy for over a century) and they rebelled against the decision, leading to the Guarani War. In Europe, where the Jesuits were under attack, they were accused of supporting the rebellion and perceived as defending the native peoples. In 1758, the Jesuits were accused of a conspiracy to kill the king of Portugal, known as the Távora affair. All members of the Society of Jesus were evicted from Portuguese territories in 1759, and from French territories in 1764. In 1766 Jesuits were accused of causing Esquilache Riots in Madrid; consequently in February 1767, Charles III of Spain signed a royal decree with expulsion orders for all members of the Society of Jesus in Spanish territories.
From then on, spiritual and secular administration were to be strictly separated. At the time of the expulsion, 25 Jesuits served a Christianized population of at least 24,000, in the ten missions of the Chiquitania. The Chiquitos mission properties included 25 "estancias" (ranches) with 31,700 cattle and 850 horses. Libraries across the settlements held 2,094 volumes.
By September 1767, all but four Jesuits had left the Chiquitania, and they went the following April. The Spanish considered it essential to maintain the settlements as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. The archbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Francisco Ramón Herboso, established a new system of government, very similar to that set up by the Jesuits. He stipulated that each mission be run by two secular (parish) priests, one to take care of the spiritual needs while the other was in charge of all other – political and economic – affairs of the mission administration. One change was that the Indians were allowed to trade. In practice, the shortage of clergy and the low quality of those appointed by the bishop – almost all of whom did not speak the language of the local peoples and in some cases had not been ordained – led to a rapid general decline of the missions. The priests also broke ethical and religious codes, appropriated the major part of the missions' income and encouraged contraband trade with the Portuguese.
Within two years of the expulsion, the population in the Chiquitos missions dropped below 20,000. Despite the general decline of the settlements, however, the church buildings were maintained and, in some cases, extended by the towns' inhabitants. The construction of the church in Santa Ana de Velasco falls into this period. Bernd Fischermann, an anthropologist who studied the Chiquitano, suggests three reasons that the Chiquitano preserved the heritage of the Jesuits even after their expulsion: the memory of their prosperity with the Jesuits; the desire to appear as civilized Christians to mestizos and white people; and to preserve the ethnicity that originated from a mix of various culturally distinct groups blended by an enforced common language and customs learned from the Jesuits.
In January 1790, the Audiencia of Charcas ended the diocese’s mismanagement, and temporal affairs were delegated to civil administrators, with the hope of making the missions economically more successful. Sixty years after the expulsion of the Jesuits the churches remained active centers of worship, as the French naturalist Alcide d'Orbigny reported during his mission to South America in 1830 and 1831. Although much diminished economically and politically, the culture the Jesuits established was still evident. According to d'Orbigny, the music at a Sunday mass in San Xavier was better than those he had heard in the richest cities of Bolivia. The population of the Chiquitania missions reached a low of around 15,000 inhabitants in 1830. In 1842 the Comte de Castelnau visited the area and, referring to the church in Santa Ana de Velasco, proclaimed: "This beautiful building, surrounded by gardens, presents one of the most impressive views imaginable."
By 1851, however, the reduction system of the missions had disappeared. Mestizos who had moved to the area in their quest for land began to outnumber the original indigenous population. Starting with the creation of the Province of José Miguel de Velasco in 1880, the Chiquitania was split into five administrative divisions. With the rubber boom at the turn of the century, more settlers came to the areas and established large haciendas, moving the economic activities together with the native peoples out of the towns.
In 1931, the spiritual administration of the missions was given to German-speaking Franciscan missionaries. Ecclesiastical control moved back to the area with the creation of the Apostolic Vicariate of Chiquitos in San Ignacio in that year. As of , the churches not only serve the mestizo inhabitants of the villages but present spiritual centers for the few remaining indigenous peoples living in the periphery.
In 1972, the Swiss architect and then-Jesuit priest Hans Roth began an extensive restoration project of the missionary churches and many colonial buildings that were in ruins. These churches exist in their present form as a result of Roth's effort, who worked on the restoration with a few colleagues and many local people until his death in 1999. The restoration works have continued sporadically into the beginning of the 21st century under local leadership.
Six of the reductions were listed as part of the World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1990. The churches of San Ignacio de Velasco, Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón have been reconstructed from scratch and are not part of the World Heritage Site. In San Juan Bautista only ruins remain. UNESCO listed the site under criteria IV and V, acknowledging the adaption of Christian religious architecture to the local environment and the unique architecture expressed in the wooden columns and banisters. Recently ICOMOS, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, warned that the traditional architectural ensemble that makes up the site has become vulnerable following agrarian reforms from 1953 which threatened the fragile socioeconomic infrastructure of the region. At the time of the nomination, the World Heritage Site was protected by the "Pro Santa Cruz" committee, "Cordecruz", "Plan Regulador de Santa Cruz", and the local mayoral offices of the mission towns.
World Heritage Missions.
San Xavier.
Initially established in 1691, the mission of San Xavier was the first of the missions listed in the World Heritage Site. In 1696, due to the incursion of Paulistas from Brazil in the east, the mission was relocated toward the San Miguel River. In 1698, it was relocated closer to Santa Cruz, but in 1708 was moved away to protect the Indians from the Spaniards. The original inhabitants of San Xavier were the Piñoca tribe. The church was built between 1749 and 1752 by the Swiss Jesuit and architect Fr. Martin Schmid. The school and church, as well as other characteristics of residential architecture, are still visible today in the village. San Xavier was restored by Hans Roth between 1987 and 1993.
San Rafael de Velasco.
The mission of San Rafael de Velasco was the second mission built out of the six inscribed the World Heritage Site. Founded in 1695 by the Jesuits Fr. Juan Bautista Zea and Fr. Francisco Hervás, it was moved several times. The mission had to be moved in 1701 and 1705 because of epidemics in the region. In 1719 the mission was moved once more due to fire. Fr. Martin Schmid built the church between 1747 and 1749, which has survived. San Rafael de Velasco was restored between 1972 and 1996 as part of Hans Roth's restoration project.
San José de Chiquitos.
Founded in 1698 by the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suárez and Fr. Dionosio Ávila, the mission of San José de Chiquitos was the third mission built of those of the World Heritage Site. At first, the mission was inhabited by the Penoca tribe. The church was built between 1745 and 1760 by an unknown architect. It is built of stone, unlike other mission churches in the area which were built with local adobe and wood. The mission is one of four that remain in their original location. As of , a mortuary chapel (1740), the church (1747), a bell tower (1748), a house for the priests ("colegio") and workshops (both 1754) still exist, and were renovated by Hans Roth's restoration project between 1988 and 2003. Restoration efforts continue.
Concepción.
The fourth mission in the World Heritage Site, the mission of Concepción, was initially founded in 1699 by the Jesuit priests Fr. Francisco Lucas Caballero and Fr. Francisco Hervás. A nearby mission, San Ignacio de Boococas, was incorporated in 1708. The mission was moved three times: in 1707, 1708 and 1722. The mission was inhabited by the Chiquitanos, the largest tribe in the region. The mission church was constructed between 1752 and 1756, by Fr. Martin Schmid and Fr. Johann Messner. From 1975 to 1996 the mission was reconstructed as part of Hans Roth's restoration project.
San Miguel de Velasco.
The fifth mission in the World Heritage Site, that of San Miguel de Velasco, was established by the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suarez and Fr. Francisco Hervás in 1721. San Miguel was an off-shoot of the mission of San Rafael de Velaso, where the population had grown too large. The mission church was built between 1752 and 1759, probably by Fr. Johann Messner, a collaborator with or student of Fr. Martin Schmid. The church was restored by Hans Roth between 1979 and 1983.
Santa Ana de Velasco.
The mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was the final World Heritage Site-inscribed mission to be established. It was founded by the Jesuit priest Fr. Julian Knogler in 1755. The original native inhabitants of the missions were the Covareca and Curuminaca tribes. The mission church was designed after the expulsion of the Jesuits between 1770 and 1780 by an unknown architect and built entirely by the indigenous population. The complex, consisting of the church, bell tower, sacristy and a grassy plaza lined by houses, is considered to have the most fidelity to the original plan of the Jesuit reductions. Starting in 1989 and lasting until 2001, the mission underwent partial restoration through the efforts of Hans Roth and his team.
Architecture.
In their design of the reductions, the Jesuits were inspired by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once during the time of the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of the settlements.
Mission layout.
The architecture and internal layout of these missions followed a scheme which was repeated later with some variations in the rest of the missionary reductions. In Chiquitos, the oldest mission, San Xavier, formed the basis for the organizational style, which consisted of a modular structure, the center formed by a wide rectangular square, with the church complex on one side and the houses of the inhabitants on the three remaining sides. The centralized organization of the Jesuits dictated a certain uniformity of measures and sizes. Despite being based on the same basic model, the towns of Chiquitos nonetheless show remarkable variations. For example, the orientation of the settlements toward the cardinal points differed and was determined by individual circumstances.
Plaza.
The plaza was an almost square area varying in size from in the older towns of San Xavier and San Rafael de Velasco to in San Ignacio de Velasco. As they were used for religious and civil purposes, these were open spaces free of vegetation except a few palm trees surrounding a cross in the center of the plaza. The evergreen palm trees symbolizing eternal love, deliberately hearkened to Psalm 92:12. Four chapels facing the central cross were placed at the corners of the square and were used in processions. Almost no remains exist of the chapels at the mission sites, as the plazas subsequently were redesigned to reflect the republican and mestizo lifestyle prevalent after the period of the Jesuits. Most have undergone recent expansion as well. Trees and shrubs were planted, and in some cases monuments were erected. Out of the original ten missions, only the plaza at Santa Ana de Velasco does not show major changes, consisting as it did in colonial times, of an open grassy space.
Houses.
The houses of the natives had an elongated layout, and were arranged in parallel lines extending from the main square in three directions. Those facing the plaza were originally occupied by the chiefs of the indigenous tribes, and often were larger. The architecture of these houses was simple, consisting of large rooms (6x4 meters), walls up to thick, and a roof made of reed ("caña") and wood ("cuchi") that reached a height of in the center. Double doors and open galleries provided protection from the elements. The latter have had a social function as meeting places up to the present day.
Over the last 150 years, this layout has been replaced by the usual Spanish colonial architecture of large square blocks with internal patios. Remnants of the initial design can still be seen in San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, places that were not as much exposed to modernization as the other settlements.
Church complex.
Along the fourth side of the plaza lay the religious, cultural and commercial centers of the towns. In addition to the church, which dominated the complex, there would have been a mortuary chapel, a tower and a "colegio" or "school", connected by a wall along the side of the plaza. Behind the wall and away from the plaza would have been the patio with living quarters for the priests or visitors, rooms for town council matters, for music and storage, as well as workshops, which often were arranged around a second patio. Behind the buildings, a vegetable garden surrounded by a wall and a cemetery likely would have been found. The cemeteries and workshops have disappeared completely from the mission settlements, while the other elements of the church complex still survive to varying degrees. Two stone towers (in San Juan Bautista and San José de Chiquitos) and one of adobe (in San Miguel de Velasco) can be traced back to the time of the Jesuits. Others are of more recent construction, or the result of the conservation and restoration work spearheaded by Roth toward the end of the 20th century. Many of these are tall wooden constructions open on all sides. Of the Jesuit schools only those in San Xavier and Concepción are preserved entirely. Like the houses of the indigenous residents, the buildings of the church complex were single-level ones.
Church.
Once a settlement had been established, the missionaries, working with the native population, began to erect the church, which served as the educational, cultural and economic center of the town. The initial church in each mission (except in Santa Ana de Velasco) was temporary, essentially no more than a chapel and built as quickly as possible of local wood, unembellished save for a simple altar. The Jesuit masterpieces seen today general were erected several decades into the settlements’ existence. Fr. Martin Schmid, Swiss priest and composer, was the architect for at least three of these missionary churches: San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco, and Concepción. Schmid combined elements of Christian architecture with traditional local design to create a unique baroque-mestizo style. Schmid placed a quotation from the Genesis 28:17 above the main entrance of each of the three churches. In San Xavier the quotation is in Spanish: ' ; and in Latin at the other two churches: ', meaning "The house of god and the gate of heaven".
The construction of the restored churches seen today falls in the period between 1745 and 1770 and is characterized by the use of locally available natural materials like wood, used in the carved columns, pulpits and sets of drawers. Artistic adornments were added even after the Jesuits’ expulsion in 1767, until around 1830. Some of the altars are covered in gold. Often the walls of the mission churches were made of adobe, the same material that had been used for the houses of the natives. In San Rafael de Velasco and San Miguel de Velasco, mica also was used on the walls, giving them an iridescent effect. The construction of the church in San José de Chiquitos is an exception: inspired by an unknown baroque model, it has a stone façade. The only other example where stone was used on a grand scale is in the construction of San Juan Bautista, although only the ruins of a tower remain.
All of the churches consist of a wooden skeleton with columns, fixed in the ground, which provided stability to the building and supported the tile-covered roof. The adobe walls were placed directly on the ground, virtually independent of the wooden construction, and had no supporting role. Porticos and a large porch roof provided protection from the heavy tropical rains. The floor was covered in tiles which, like those of the roof, were produced in local tile works. The churches have a barn-like appearance, albeit of monumental size (width: , length: height: ) with a capacity for more than 3,000 people, with a wide structure and distinctive low-hanging eaves. This style also is evident in the building method of native community houses.
The construction of the church required a major effort by the community and employed hundreds of indigenous carpenters. Fr. José Cardiet described the process:
The walls were decorated with cornices, moldings, pilasters and at times blind arcades. First the walls were plastered entirely by a mix of mud, sand, lime and straw, both inside and outside. Paint in earth tones was applied over the lime whitewash, and ornaments were drawn, featuring elements from flora and fauna, as well as angels, saints and geometrical patterns. As noted above, in some cases mica was used to decorate the walls, columns and woodworks. Large oval "oeil-de-boeuf" windows, surrounded by relief petals, above the main doors are a characteristic feature.
The churches had three aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting resembling those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, there were no pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn the inside of the churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands. The tradition of figure carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, finials and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area. In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.
Restoration.
The missionary churches are the true architectural highlights of the area. Hans Roth initiated an important restoration project in these missionary churches in 1972. In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco, San José de Chiquitos, Concepción, San Miguel de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, these churches have undergone meticulous restoration. In the 1960s, the San Ignacio de Velasco church was replaced with modern construction; in the 1990s, Hans Roth and his co-workers brought the restoration as close as possible to the original edifices. In addition to the churches, Roth constructed more than a hundred new buildings, including schools and houses. He also founded museums and archives.
Roth researched and recovered the original techniques used to construct churches prior to the restorations. He installed new building infrastructure including saw mills, locksmith shops, and carpentry and repair shops, and trained local people in traditional crafts. European volunteers, non-profit organizations, the Catholic Church, and the Bolivian Learning Institute (IBA) helped in the project.
Roth convinced the local inhabitants of the importance of the restoration works, which required a large labor force: typically 40 to 80 workers in towns with populations of 500 to 2,000 were required for church restoration. The effort indicates the strength of and commitment to the unique shared heritage present in the towns. This restoration has resulted in a revival of local traditions and a qualified workforce.
Life in the mission towns.
The reductions were self-sufficient indigenous communities of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the "cabildo" (town council and "cacique" (tribal leader), who retained their functions and played the role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, the degree to which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.
The Jesuits quickly learned the languages of their subjects, which eased the missionary work and contributed to the success of the missions. Although initially each mission were conceived as home to one specific tribe, numerous tribal families lived in the Chiquitania, and often were gathered in next to each other on the same mission. According to a report from 1745, of the 14,706 people living in the missions, 65.5% spoke Chiquitano, 11% Arawak, 9.1% Otuquis, 7.9% Zamucos, 4.4% Chapacura and 2.1% Guaraní. It should, however, be understood that by this time most of the inhabitants of these missions spoke Chiquitano as a second language. Such ethnic diversity is unique among the Jesuit missions in America. Reflecting the view of the colonial powers, the Jesuit records only distinguished between Christian and non-Christian Indios. Eventually Gorgotoqui, the formal name for language spoken by the Chiquitano tribe, became the "lingua franca" of the mission settlements, and the numerous tribes were culturally united in the Chiquitano ethnic group. By 1770, within three years of the expulsion of the Jesuits, Spanish authorities instituted a new policy of forced "castilianization" or "Hispanicization" of the language, thereby causing the number of speakers of native languages to decline.
Many Indians who joined the missions were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the "encomienda" system of the Spanish "conquistadores". In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in the missions was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities in harmony with the paradise where they had encountered the indigenous peoples.
Though the settlements were officially a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru through the Royal Audiencia of Charcas and of the diocese of Santa Cruz in church affairs, their remoteness made them effectively autonomous and self-sufficient. As early as 1515, the Franciscan friar Bartolomé de las Casas had initiated a "foreigner law" for the "'Indian people'", and no white or black man, other than the Jesuits and authorities, was allowed to live in the missions. Merchants were allowed to stay for three days at most.
Economy.
Traditionally most of the Chiquitos tribes practiced swidden agriculture, growing maize and yuca on a small scale. After contact with the Spanish, cocoa and rice also were cultivated. Hunting and fishing provided additional nutrition in the dry season. The Jesuits introduced cattle breeding.
In each settlement, one of the Jesuits was responsible for church matters, while another dealt with commercial affairs and the general well-being of the community. As the Swiss priest, musician and architect Fr. Martin Schmid wrote in a 1744 letter from San Rafael: The Jesuits administered labor, the introduction of new technologies, and the disposition of goods. They designated that each family receive all that was necessary to live. The Jesuits did not rely on donations, because by right the priests received a fixed income (usually insufficient for their needs) from the community to support their work. The thriving economy in the reductions enabled them to export surplus goods to all parts of Upper Peru, although ironically not to Paraguay – the region the Jesuits most wanted to reach. The income was used to pay royal tributes and to purchase goods not locally available, such as books, paper, and wine, from as far away as Europe. In the missions themselves money was not used. This laid the foundation of the belief that the Jesuits were guarding immense riches acquired through local labor. In reality the communities were economically successful but hardly constituted any important source of income for the Jesuit order.
All the inhabitants, including the young and elderly, were subject to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, the inhabitants of the Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions. There was also less time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group and the rest of the population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two "alcaldes". Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.
Music.
Music played a special part in all aspects of life and in the evangelization of the natives. Realizing the musical capacities of the Indians, the Jesuits sent important composers, choir directors, and manufacturers of musical instruments to South America. The most famous was probably the Italian baroque composer Domenico Zipoli, who worked in the reductions in Paraguay. Fr. Johann Mesner and Fr. Martin Schmid, two Jesuit missionaries with musical talent, went to the Chiquitania. Schmid in particular was responsible for this skill being developed to such a high degree that polyphonic choirs would perform, and whole orchestras would play Baroque operas on handmade instruments. He directed the production of violins, harps, flutes, and organs, and wrote and copied masses, operas, and motets. He built an organ with six stops in Potosí, disassembled it, transported it by mules over a distance of on a difficult road to the remote mission of Santa Ana de Velasco, and re-assembled it there from hand. It is still is use. The Jesuits used musical lessons as a first step to the Christianization of the natives.
As Schmid, who also acted as a composer, wrote in a 1744 letter from San Rafael de Velasco: 
Today.
Some Jesuit institutions still exist in the Chiquitania. For example the towns of San Rafael de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, Santa Ana de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco have functioning town councils ("cabildos"), and the "caciques" and the sexton still retain their capacities. The majority of the population of the Chiquitania is staunchly Catholic; the Chiquitano cosmovision is now only a dimly understood mythology for its inhabitants. Between 1992 and 2009, the populations of San Xavier and especially Concepción tripled, and more than doubled in San Ignacio de Velasco, now the region’s fastest-growing municipality. In other mission towns the population also increased, albeit on a smaller scale. As of 2011, San José de Chiquitos, San Xavier and Concepción have around 10,000 inhabitants each; and San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the Chiquitania, has about 35,000 and is now boasts a campus of a national university. On the other hand, in Santa Ana de Velasco there are currently only a few hundred people. The remoter settlements of Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón are quite small as well. According to various sources, in Bolivia the number of ethnic Chiquitanos is between 30,000 and 47,000  of which less than 6,000 – mainly elderly people – still speak the original language. Only a few hundred are monolingual in the Chiquitano language.
Economically, the area depends on agriculture. Maize, rice, yuca, cotton and heart of palm are produced and exported. Cattle ranching and the industrial processing of milk and cheese have been developed extensively in recent years. Crafts, often carved of wood using the same techniques as in colonial times, provide additional income. Since the launch of the Jesuit Mission Circuit – a marketing label to promote regional tourism – in 2005, craftsmanship and tourism have been closely related.
The musical festivals and concerts held regularly in the Chiquitos formermission towns testify to the living heritage of this art form. Some of the original instruments and sculptures made by Fr. Martin Schmid and his apprentices survive in small museums in the mission towns, most notably in Concepción which also houses the music archive. In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco three original harps from the time of the Jesuits are preserved. The church in Santa Ana de Vealsco also houses the only original organ in Chiquitos, transported there from Potosí by mule, accompanied by Schmid in 1751. More than a dozen orchestras and choirs brought together by the "Sistema de Coros y Orquestas" (SICOR) dot the area.
Since 1996, the nonprofit institution "Asociacion Pro Arte y Cultura" (APAC) has organized the biennial "Festival Internacional de Musica Renacentista y Barroca Americana".
Starting in 1975, restoration work on the church (now cathedral) of Concepción unearthed more than 5,000 musical scores from the 17th and 18th centuries. Later another 6,000 scores were found in Moxos and several thousand additionally in San Xavier. Some of these works have been interpreted at the 2006 and 2008 festivals. The statistics of these festivals over the years is as follows:
The festival is carried out in the designated "Plazas Misionales" (among other places), usually housed in churches and also in the main plaza of Santa Cruz. In one event, orchestras of various countries compete against each other. One of the local orchestras, "Orquesta Urubicha", is made up of people native to the ex-missions who use instruments which they build themselves according to plans left by the Jesuit missionaries.
Tourism.
Shortly after the start of the restoration effort, the potential for tourism in the missions was assessed in a report published by UNESCO in 1977.
To promote the missions as a tourist destination, travel agencies, chambers of commerce and industry, the towns' mayors, native communities and other institutions organized the "", a five-day tourist event lasting from March 23–27, 2006. Journalists and international tour operators were shown the important tourist attractions, and introduced to the culture through visits to museums, local workshops, various concerts, native dances, high masses, processions, crafts festivals, and local cuisine. The organisers’ goal initially was to raise the number of tourists from 25,000 to 1 million per year over a ten-year period, which would have represented US$400 million of income. Subsequently, in the face of lack of support from the Bolivian government and the downturn of the national and local economies, a more modest goal of attracting between 200,000 and 250,000 people per annum was established.
Tourism is now an important source of income for the region, amounting in Concepción Municipio alone to US$ 296,140, or 7.2% of the annual gross production. An additional US$ 40,000 or 1% comes from crafts. According to a report published by the "Coordinadora Interinstitucional de la Provincia Velasco" in 2007, 17,381 people visited San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the region, as tourists in 2006. About 30% of them came from outside of Bolivia. The main attraction for tourists are the nearby missions of San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco. Tourism to San Ignacio de Velasco generated 7,821,450 Bolivianos in income in 2006. Tourism income is ostensibly translated to improvements in the infrastructure, although there has been criticism that earmarked funds do not always reach their intended destinations. Other than cultural tourism to the missionary circuit and musical festivals, the region offers many natural attractions like rivers, lagoons, hot springs, caves and waterfalls, although there is no infrastructure to support tourism in this regard.
Cultural references.
Many elements of the early days of the Jesuit missions are shown in the movie "The Mission", although the movie attempts to depict life in the Guaraní missions of Paraguay, not those of the Chiquitos missions, which were considerably more culturally expressive. The events around the expulsion of the Jesuits (the Extrañamiento) are depicted in Fritz Hochwälder's play (The Strong are Lonely). Both are set in Paraguay. It has been suggested that "Das heilige Experiment" sparked interest in the 20th century among scholars in the forgotten Jesuit missions.

Historic accounts.
Of the primary sources, i.e., those composed by the Jesuits themselves during the years 1691 through 1767, those that have been extensively researched (many as yet have not been thoroughly examined) are few. The most useful is the monumental "Historia general de la Compañía de Jesús en la Provincia del Perú: Crónica anómina de 1600 que trata del establecimiento y misiones de la Compañía de Jesús en los países de habla española en la América meridional", vol. II, edited by Francisco Mateos (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1944). Also of importance is the unedited archive of correspondence from the Jesuits of Paraguay from the years 1690-1718. Collectively known as “Cartas a los Provinciales de la Provincia del Paraguay 1690-1718,” these manuscripts are housed in the Jesuit Archives of Argentina in Buenos Aires, which also contain the invaluable annals of the Paraguay Province of the Company of Jesus, covering the years 1689-1762. The German edition of Fr. Julián Knogler’s "Inhalt einer Beschreibung der Missionen deren Chiquiten, Archivum Historicum Societatis Jesu, 39/78" (Rome: Company of Jesus, 1970) is indispensable, as is his account "Relato sobre el país y la nación de los Chiquitos en las Indias Occidentales o América del Sud y en la misiones en su territorio", for a condensed version of which, see Werner Hoffman, "Las misiones jesuíticas entre los chiquitanos" (Buenos Aires: Fundación para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura, 1979). Fr. Juan de Montenegro’s "Breve noticia de las missiones, peregrinaciones apostólicas, trabajos, sudor, y sangre vertida, en obsequio de la fe, de el venerable padre Augustín Castañares, de la Compañía de Jesús, insigne missionero de la provincia del Paraguay, en las missiones de Chiquitos, Zamucos, y ultimamente en la missión de los infieles Mataguayos", (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor del Supremo Consejo de la Inquisición, de la Reverenda Cámara Apostólica, y del Convento de las Señoras de la Encarnación, en la Caba Baxa, 1746) and Fr. Juan Patricio Fernández’s "Relación historial de las misiones de los indios, que llaman chiquitos, que están a cargo de los padres de la Compañía de Jesús de la provincia del Paraguay" (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor de Libros, 1726) are also valuable. There are other primary sources as yet unexamined, the majority of which are archived in Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija (in Bolivia); Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Tucumán (in Argentina); Asunción (Paraguay); Madrid; and Rome.
References to many others are found in the extensive bibliography offered by Roberto Tomichá Charupá, OFM, in "La Primera Evangelización en las Reducciones de Chiquitos, Bolivia (1691-1767)", pp. 669–714.

Lulworth (yacht)

Lulworth is a racing yacht which was built in Southampton in 1920.
The Big Class.
The boat's name comes from Lulworth Castle, which belonged to her second owner, Herbert Weld, whose grandfather was a charter-member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. The "Lulworth" (1920) was built by the White Brothers' Yard for Richard H. Lee, who wanted a racing boat to compete in the premier yachting league in Europe: the British "Big Class". 
Shortages in the supply of premium spruce after World War I meant that "Lulworth"s original lower-mast was made of steel instead of wood. This constraint handicapped "Lulworth" greatly, leaving her trailing older, more famous Big Class racers like Thomas Benjamin Frederick Davis's Herreshoff-designed schooner "Westward" (1910), "HMY Britannia I" (1893) and Sir Thomas J. Lipton's Fife-designed 23mR "Shamrock" (1908). 
Her gaff-rigged sail plan was updated several times to no avail, until America's Cup naval architect Charles Ernest Nicholson redesigned the rig with a wooden lower-mast and adjusted the keel balance. By 1924, "Lulworth's" flaws were corrected and she became an accomplished racer in all subsequent seasons of the Big Class: from 1920 to 1930, she took part in 258 regattas, taking 59 first places, 47 of which were after 1924.
Obsolescence and revival.
The Fifteenth America's Cup in 1930 saw the arrival of the innovative J-Class designs which made all gaff-rigged racers obsolete. Despite The "Lulworth's" early successes against the J-Class "Shamrock V" (1930) before the America's Cup, handicapping rules in the Big Class were ended and "Lulworth's" racing career was over. In 1947 "Lulworth" was saved from the scrap yard by Richard Lucas and his wife Rene. She was taken to Whites Shipyard for restoration and mud-berthed in the River Hamble where she served as a houseboat. 
In 1990 her hull was shipped to Italy in hopes of a refit. A meticulous renovation was started in 2002 which saved 70% of her furnishings and 80% of her steel frames. The sail plan from 1926 was replicated to recreate "Lulworth's" rig, which features the world's tallest wooden mast. Thus rebuilt to Lloyd's Classification, she was relaunched in 2006. This remarkable refit is documented in the book "Lulworth: The Restoration of a Century" by Andrew Rogers.
"Lulworth" immediately re-entered racing competition and subsequently won "Boat International" Magazine's World Superyacht Awards 2007: "Best refit of 2006". "Lulworth" is the world's largest cutter.

Bridges in New Zealand

The bridges in New Zealand are many and varied but only date back to the beginning of European settlement in the mid 19th century.
Road bridges.
Some of the longest bridges on the state highway network are:
Single lane bridges.
New Zealand, due to its low traffic density, has had many single lane bridges. Some of those still exist on the state highway network and are criticised by road users. These are progressively replaced with two lane structures. The oldest and one of the longest single lane bridge on the state highway network until December 2011 was the 463-metre Kopu Bridge spanning the Waihou River, this was replaced by a 580-metre, 2 lane structure, which opened to traffic on 12 December 2011.
Rail bridges.
There are 1787 bridges on the rail network in New Zealand which are maintained by ONTRACK, the infrastructure arm of the New Zealand Railways Corporation.
Road/rail bridges.
There are two bridges on the State Highway on West Coast that have rail lines on the road carriageway. Until 2008 the Awatere River bridge had a rail line above the road way. A new road bridge has been constructed with the railway now being the sole use of the original bridge.
Two bridges on now-closed sections of the East Coast Main Trunk line are still in use by road-traffic only.
The single deck Pekatahi Bridge, which spans the Whakatane River near Taneatua carries State Highway Two and the mothballed rails of the ECMT.
The rare doublee-deck road-rail bridge at Karangahake Gorge, which crosses the Ohinemuri River, still carries a local road on the lower level, whilst on the upper level, the railway has been replaced by a walkway.
Footbridges.
Since there are numerous large rivers in New Zealand many footbridges have been constructed in the backcountry. During the 1950s many bridges were built, along with backcountry huts, to give hunters access to forested areas to cull introduced deer which had by that stage become a serious pest. Some of the bridges still remain but other have been washed away or replaced with new ones and are now often used due to the popularity of tramping (hiking).
Bridge disasters and incidents.
On April 30, during the 1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute a rail bridge was blown up near Huntly. The train drivers were warned in advance and the bombing severely disrupted coal supplies.
Tangiwai disaster.
The Tangiwai disaster on 24 December 1953, was the worst rail accident in New Zealand. The rail bridge over the Whangaehu river at Tangiwai had been badly damaged by a lahar from Mount Ruapehu just minutes before a passenger train was due to cross it. 151 of the 285 passengers aboard the train were killed.
The Berrymans' bridge.
In 1986 the New Zealand Army built the Te Rata Bridge as a training exercise on a private farm owned by the Berryman family. In 1994 a beekeeper visiting the farm was killed when the bridge collapsed as he drove over it. The incident caused a series of high profile court cases.

Jahangiri Mahal

Jahangiri Mahal (Hindi: जहाँगीरी महल, Urdu: جہانگیری محل), may be the most noteworthy building inside the Agra Fort of India. The Mahal was the principal zenana (palace for women belonging to the royal household), and was used mainly by the Rajput wives of Akbar. It is a blend of Hindu and Central Asian architecture.
History.
The palace was built by Emperor Akbar as a token of love for his son, Jahangir, who later became Emperor. Mughal empress Nur Jahan used this as her residence.
There is a huge bowl called "Hauz-i-Jahangiri", that it is carved out of a single piece of stone. This was used as a container for fragrant rose water.

Jackson T. Davis

Jackson T. Davis (September 25, 1882 - April 15, 1947) was an educator and author from Virginia. In a career spanning 45 years in the first half of the 20th century, he became an international leader in African American education in the United States and Africa. 
Among his accomplishments was development of the Jeanes Foundation's Supervising Teacher Program, leadership of the General Education Board in New York City, (later part of the Rockefeller Foundation), and participation in the planning which led to the formation of the United Negro College Fund which helps support students attending historically black colleges and universities in the United States.
The Jackson Davis Collection of over 5,000 photographs and numerous manuscripts and documents housed at the University of Virginia is one of the more comprehensive archives available for research on the topic of minority education during the Jim Crow era in the southern United States.
Youth, education.
Jackson T. Davis was born on September 25, 1882 in Cumberland County, Virginia to William Anderson Davis and Sally Wyatt (née Guy) Davis. He was educated in Richmond City Public Schools, Richmond, and attended the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, where he graduated in the Class of 1902 with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. He earned his Master of Arts (M.A.) degree from Columbia University in 1908.
Honorary Doctor of Law (LL.D.) degrees were conferred upon him by the University of Richmond in 1930 and the College of William and Mary in 1931.
Family.
On May 19, 1911, Davis married Corinne Mansfield in Bluffton, Georgia. They had two daughters, Helen Mansfield Davis (who married John Phillip Lynch, Jr.) and Ruth Elizabeth Davis (who married Charles Rolfe Langhorne). His wife of 30 years predeceased him in 1941.
Career.
Jackson Davis served in various positions around Virginia, mostly with the public schools, for 15 years. He then went on to work with the New York City-based General Education Board, where for the next 30 years he focused on rural and African American education in the southern United States and became an internationally known leader in his field.
Virginia public schools.
Upon graduating from the College of William and Mary in 1902, he first became the principal of the public schools of Williamsburg, a small city where William and Mary is located. From 1903 to 1904, he was assistant secretary of the YMCA in the City of Roanoke. He was next principal of the Smyth County Public Schools in the incorporated town of Marion from 1904-1905.
In 1905, Jackson Davis was named Division Superintendent of Henrico County Public Schools, a school division in the large county which adjoins Richmond, where he served for five years. In 1908, he became professionally involved with another Virginian, Virginia Estelle Randolph, who was also to become well known in African-American education as they led Henrico County's role in beginning the work of the Jeanes Foundation. 
Anna T. Jeanes was a wealthy Quaker who lived in Philadelphia. She had outlived her other family members. She has been described as "a remarkable woman with a vision for Christian peace which she used her fortune to promote." As she neared the end of her life, she was approached by Dr. Booker T. Washington and others to see if she would help fund their efforts. If she could, she wanted to help "the little country schools", and set aside $1 million from her family inheritance to establish a fund called the Jeanes Foundation. The purpose was to maintain and assist rural schools for African Americans in the South. The organization provided funds to employ supervisors of teachers who were dedicated to upgrading vocational training programs for teachers of black students. 
Virginia Estelle Randolph was the third child of former slaves Sarah Elizabeth Carter Randolph and Edward Nelson Randolph. At the age of 16, she graduated from Richmond Normal School (now Armstrong High School) in Richmond, Virginia. Miss Randolph began her career as a school teacher in Goochland County, and then secured a teaching position with the Henrico County School Board, where she opened the Mountain Road School in the north central part of the county in 1892. As a teacher there, Randolph taught her students woodworking, sewing, cooking, and gardening, as well as academics. In 1908, following a proclamation by Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson, Miss Randolph founded the first Arbor Day Program in Virginia as she and her students planted twelve Sycamore trees.
That year, Davis, a young (24-years old) Superintendent, enlisted Miss Randolph (who was only 32) to bring her 15 years of experience and talents to the Jeanes Foundation program and appointed her to become the United States' first Jeanes Supervising Industrial Teacher. As the overseer of twenty three elementary schools in Henrico County, Virginia Randolph worked with Davis to develop the first in-service training program for black teachers and worked on improving the curriculum of the schools. With the freedom to design her own agenda, she shaped industrial work and community self-help programs to meet specific needs of schools. She chronicled her progress by becoming the author of the "Henrico Plan" which became a reference book for southern schools receiving assistance from the Jeanes Foundation, which later became known as the Negro Rural School Fund. The teachers were educated to use the procedures developed by Miss Randolph, Jackson Davis and others in normal schools such as today's Hampton University, Tuskegee University and many other historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).
Dr. James H. Dillard, president of the Jeanes Foundation, credited Jackson Davis and Virginia Randolph as the inventors of the real Jeanes plan. Their work together with the Jeanes Foundation development project helped both Davis and Randolph to commit the rest of their lives to rural and African American education. 
In 1910, Jackson Davis was named State Agent for African-American rural schools for the Virginia State Department of Education. Serving from 1910–1915, during this time, he traveled extensively around Virginia, visiting communities, meeting teachers and pupils, and inspecting facilities. His surviving collection of photographs provided vivid graphical impact to accompany his reports from this period of the racially-segregated schools in Virginia.
General Education Board.
In 1915, Davis became affiliated with the General Education Board as a field agent. Two years, we was promoted to be the board's general field agent at headquarters in New York City. In 1929, he was named assistant director. He became associate director in 1933 and vice-president and director in 1946.
For 30 years, Davis specialized in education and interracial problems in both the Southern United States, and in Africa, notably Belgian Congo and Liberia. In 1935 he went to Africa as a Carnegie visitor, and in 1944 went again as head of a group sent by the Foreign Missions Conference of North America, the British Conference of Missions, and the Phelps-Stokes Fund.
Dr. Davis was also a trustee of the Phelps-Stokes Fund, an organization devoted to African-American education and race relations both in America and in Africa. He became vice-president of the fund in 1940, and succeeded Anson Phelps Stokes as president in 1946.
In 1943, Dr. Davis was involved with the planning that led to creation of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), stating "an effort of this kind would provide the form of expression which is needed to promote better interracial relations and that there are many people who would find this the most desirable way possible to express their good will toward the Negro." Early supporters of the UNCF included President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. 
He was also a frequent contributor to educational journals. In 1946, he co-authored "Africa Advancing: A Study of Rural Education and Agriculture in West Africa and the Belgian Congo", with Margaret Wrong and Thomas M. Campbell. The book provided the results of an earlier survey (made in 1944).
Death, legacy.
Dr. Davis died suddenly at his home in Cartersville, Virginia on April 15, 1947. In Henrico County, Virginia, Jackson Davis Elementary School, dedicated in 1962, was named for him.
The Jackson Davis Collection of over 5,000 photographs and numerous manuscripts and documents was given to the Special Collections Department of the University of Virginia by his daughters and additional papers were late added by his granddaughters. The collection is located in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs

Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs (also known as "Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs") () was an ethnic Bulgarian political party in the Ottoman Empire, created after the Young Turk Revolution, by members of the Internal Macedonian Adrianople Revolutionary Organization. The party functioned for a little over a year - from September 1908 until November 1909. Its main political rival was the Peoples' Federative Party (Bulgarian Section).
Inauguration, Ideas and Goals.
The Constituent assembly of the party was held between the 7'th and the 13'th of September 1908 in Solun. Attending the congress were 72 representatives of the Macedonian-Bulgarian middle class, but only two farmers, one craftsman and one worker. A statute and an agenda of the organization were soon established:
"The Bulgarian Constitutional Club has as its aim: a) to give civic and political education of the Bulgarian people in the spirit of the constitutional freedoms in autonomous Macedonia and Adrianople; b) to preserve and develop Bulgarian culture."
Toma Karajovov, Vladimir Rumenov, Todor Lazarov were voted members of the Central Committee. Among the founders of the party were also Georgi Kulishev, Georgi Bazhdarov, Kiril Parlichev, Andon Dimitrov, Hristo Batandzhiev, Simeon Radev and others. Hristo Tatarchev openly supported UBCC, although he never participated in the organizaztion's affairs.
'Otechestvo' ("Fatherland" in Bulgarian) served as the party's newspaper. An article, dedicated to the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising and published in issue 43 of the newspaper from July 18, 1909, reads:
"The tenth of July ("Huriet"), is an epilogue of Ilinden: Ilinden is the most solemn act of the great Macedonian revolutionary struggle. Without Ilinden there would be no July 10. The latter date is all-Ottoman. Ilinden belongs to us, the Bulgarians."
The Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs put emphasis on the collective rights of the non-Turkish peoples in the Ottoman Empire; agricultural and social reforms, aiming an improvement of the lives of Christians. The party concentrated efforts on the subject of autonomy for Macedonia and the region of Adrianople. It also believed in the important role of the Bulgarian Exarchate in unifying Bulgarians from those regions. The organization was a strong opponent to the colonization of the Macedonian land by Muslim settlers.

P. J. Mara

Patrick James "P. J." Mara (born 1942) is an Irish public affairs consultant and former senator. He was best known as a political adviser to former Taoiseach Charles Haughey. He served briefly in the Seanad on two separate occasions, in 1981 and 1982. On both occasions, he was nominated by the Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Mara served as Press Secretary to Fianna Fáil between 1983 and 1987. In 1987 he was appointed Government Press Secretary, and he held this position until February 1992, when he left the public service to move into the private sector. He subsequently returned to serve as Fianna Fáil director of elections for the 1997, 2002, and 2007 general elections. He is a member of the board of Digicel, the company founded by Denis O'Brien to build mobile networks in the Caribbean.
He was regularly lampooned on the satirical RTÉ radio sketch show "Scrap Saturday", which ran from 1989 to 1991.
Flood Tribunal.
Mara was one of the components of the so-called Century Radio module at the Flood Tribunal. Mara told the Tribunal that during the course of his employment as a Press Secretary, his financial remuneration was not sufficient to meet his immediate financial requirements, and he experienced financial difficulties. He said he received assistance from his friends, Oliver Barry and financier Dermot Desmond, in the form of loans. However there was no interest charge, nor was there any fixed schedule for repayment. Those making the loans did not intend that the sums advanced would be treated as gifts by Mara, but were content to receive their money back, once Mara was in a position so to do. Desmond told the Tribunal that he had lent £46,000 to Mr Mara between 1986 and 1989. Mr Barry said he remembered lending Mara a sum of £2,000 on one occasion between 1982 and 1984.
In the Second Interim Report of the Flood Tribunal, Judge Feargus Flood found that Mara failed to co-operate with the Tribunal by: "Failing to provide the Tribunal with details of an account in the name of Pullman Limited, operated by him at Royal Bank of Scotland in the Isle of Man, when swearing his Affidavit of Discovery made pursuant to an Order of the Tribunal requiring him to discover, "inter alia", any such account."

<doc id="19727780" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19727780" title="The Scaramanga Six">
The Scaramanga Six

The Scaramanga Six are an English rock band noted for their aggressive live act, their flamboyant and theatrical songs and their independent business practices. Self-managed and self-releasing, they have been described as “working entirely outside the indie scene, let alone the actual industry." A significant band on the Leeds rock scene, they are also involved in recordings promotion and distribution via their Wrath Records label and video promotion via the associated Poison Pen Films business. Their business practises and promotion of other artists has seen them hailed as “the closest we'll see to a British answer to Fugazi." The band has historically been based around a core of Paul Morricone, Steven Morricone and Julia Arnez.
Sound, influences and lyrical themes.
The Scaramanga Six play a tuneful and carefully arranged mixture of heavy rock, vocal pop, rockabilly, garage and crooner songs described as “intense-yet-aloof rock operas” (Drowned In Sound), “B-movie chic combined with real musical muscle” (Kerrang) and which has seen them compared to “a British Queens Of The Stone Age." Influences cited by the band themselves include The Stranglers, Cardiacs, The Cramps and Tony Bennett. Their song lyrics are characterised by themes of dark humour, desperation, tongue-in-cheek self-aggrandisement, criminality, “the drudgery of everyday life, work and office politics”, and human/animal behaviourism. The band has a strong visual sense reflected in their use of video and their onstage presentation (they perform in a Mafia-style “confrontational family” manner wearing suits and ties and have a tendency to stare out audiences).
History.
Origins, and Scaramanga (1995–1999).
Chief songwriters and fraternal twin brothers Paul Morricone (vocals, guitar, saxophone) and Steven Morricone (vocals, bass, keyboards, saxophone) were born in Weston-super-Mare, UK. They spent their formative years absorbing a mixture of The Stranglers and Tony Bennett, resulting in the discovery that “there was much fun to be had in crooning and shouting in equal measures." The brothers went to university in Yorkshire and remained in Huddersfield after graduation. In 1995, they formed the band Scaramanga with guitarist Bill Bailey, also recruiting keyboard player John Gulliver (alias "Chester Valentino") and Emma Calvert on vocals, percussion and drums. This line-up (bolstered by drummer Jem Bowden) recorded the demo cassette "Tetsura" (two of the songs on the tape, "Choking" and "Ladies And Gentlemen" would later appear on subsequent recordings). 
Calvert left in late spring 1996 to be replaced by Julia Arnez (vocals, guitar), with whom the band recorded another demo tape called "Big Themes And Incidental Music" and another recording called "Stereo Car Chase". Evidence on the Scaramanga Six homepage - an inlay scan - also suggests that another cassette mini-album was produced, called "The Liar The Bitch And Her Wardrobe", although it is not mentioned in the homepage biography. None of the tracks on the inlay match the subsequent album of the same name.
In late 1997, the band recorded a split single for Double Plus records with Slot Jockey (the Scaramanga contribution being "Vamp", co-sung/screamed by Arnez and Steven Morricone). Scaramanga gigged in Northern England for another year and a half before renaming themselves The Scaramanga Six.
Early Scaramanga Six - "The Liar The Bitch And Her Wardrobe" & "Are You One Of The Family?" (1999–2001).
The debut Scaramanga Six album - "The Liar The Bitch And Her Wardrobe" – was released in spring 1999 on the band’s own label, Trinity Records (later to metamorphose into Wrath Records). Mostly recorded as a live-in-the-studio session, the album also included "Vamp" and several songs which would later be improved and re-recorded for later releases ("Poison Fang", "The Coward" and "Horrible Face" on the "Cabin Fever" album and "Singer Of Songs" for the "…Continuing Saga" EP). At this point, Julia Arnez wrote songs, played guitar and sang almost as many lead vocals as the Morricone brothers. On subsequent records she would concentrate (by choice) on guitar and harmony vocals, and would not participate in the writing.
By summer 1999 James Agnew (a cousin of the Morricone brothers) had replaced Bowden on drums. Jenny "Jet" Harris (formerly with another Leeds band, Chest) joined on guitar and keyboards a year later in summer 2000. In April 2001 the band released the "Are You One Of The Family?" EP (the debut release by the newly launched Wrath Records). This began to gain the band attention in underground publications across Britain, and featured a re-recording of “Ladies And Gentlemen” from the band’s first demo tape. However, by this point the band had parted company with Bill Bailey, who had left during the EP sessions.
Progress and consolidation: "The Continuing Saga..." & "Strike! Up The Band" (2002–2003).
In January 2002, the band released another strong EP, "The Continuing Saga Of The Scaramanga Six" with the driving "Pressure Cage" as the lead song. The EP featured several inventive video clips directed by Paul Morricone, whose day job was as a film and television director/editor. (He had helped to establish Poison Pen Films - affiliated to Metro Films in Leeds - which would handle all future Scaramanga Six video work). In September 2002, the band released a split single with Les Flames, contributing the song "You Do, You Die". 
The second Scaramanga Six album - "Strike! Up The Band" - was released in November 2002 and compiled various tracks from the last few EPs and singles as well as new tracks. It was described by Rock Sound as “retro-rock with panache… as raw as scraping your knuckles on a cheese-grater.” It would also be the last time (to date) when The Scaramanga Six would match their name and appear as a sextet. Problems with lineups continued to dog the band, partly due to their stubborn determination to remain independent and self-financing via dayjobs. John Gulliver had already left and rejoined the band several times since 2000, becoming something of a "floating member" before leaving for good in 2002. He was followed by Jenny Harris, who took up a career in arts administration. Finally, James Agnew left the band in order to move to Australia (although he would later return to Britain and join The Gresham Flyers in late 2006). The remaining band members soldiered on, recruiting Stephen Gilchrist (ex-Quint, stuffy/the fuses) as the new drummer. 
The band toured in February 2003 to promote "Strike! Up The Band" (with Jenny Harris helping out on keyboards at a couple of gigs). Following the tour the band settled as a four-piece of the Morricone brothers, Arnez and Gilchrist. Steven Morricone would double on bass guitar and keyboard at future live concerts. At this point, the Scaramanga Six also began a fruitful (and ongoing) collaboration with producer Tim Smith (leader of Cardiacs), beginning regular recording sessions at Smith’s Wiltshire studios. By the end of 2003, the band had recorded most of their next album. However, they had also parted company with Stephen Gilchrist, who left to work with Graham Coxon and to concentrate on his own band stuffy/the fuses). He was replaced as drummer by Anthony Sargeant, a musician poached from a Queen tribute band (and who could add falsetto backing vocals to the band’s live set). In December 2003, the band released another split single (with Beachbuggy), contributing "The Poison Pen".
"Cabin Fever" (2004 to 2006).
The third Scaramanga Six album, "Cabin Fever", was released in April 2004, receiving rave reviews in the underground press. Trakmarx stated "The Scaramanga Six have talent, taste & humour in spades - all they need now is your patronage" while Gigwise commented that ""Cabin Fever" makes you laugh, stroke your imaginary goatee, dance like a frog on E and shit your pants in one hearing." The band toured around the UK and released two singles from the album - "We Rode The Storm" (November 2004) and "Horrible Face" (May 2005 - the latter another re-recording of a "…Liar…" song).
At around this time, The Scaramanga Six became a quintet when multi-instrumentalist Chris Catalyst was brought into the band. Catalyst was a well-known man-of-a-thousand bands: besides his own Robochrist project, he had worked with The Sisters Of Mercy, AntiProduct, The Tanks With Wings and two Wildhearts spin-offs (God Damn Whores and Clam Abuse). He could cover keyboards, second drum set and backing vocals (plus occasional bass and trombone), greatly expanding the band’s live potential. In November 2005, the band revealed new material with the release of "I Wear My Heart On My Sleeve", the Scaramanga Six half of a split single (with Me Against Them).
"The Dance Of Death", "Walking Through Houses" and "Hot Flesh Rumble" (2007–2008).
In August 2006 (and with Sargeant now replaced on drums by “Maraca” Gareth Champion) The Scaramanga Six released a new single called "Baggage". The single also featured on their fourth album, "The Dance Of Death", released in January 2007 and hailed as their most accomplished and coherent release to date. A re-released "I Wear My Heart On My Sleeve" was released as a stand-alone single in November 2007.
In May 2008 The Scaramanga Six released a brand new single - "Walking Through Houses" - and announced the title of an upcoming fifth album - "A Pound Of Flesh". However, in an e-mail newsletter to the band's mailing list on October 17, 2008, Steven Morricone announced that "A Pound Of Flesh" would be shelved indefinitely following the cardiac arrest and subsequent hospitalisation of producer Tim Smith. Steven explained "The news was a dreadful shock to people, especially to his many close friends. Tim is now starting out on a long road to recovery and we can only wish him and everyone close to him the greatest of strength and resolve in this very difficult time. If love alone is all that is needed for recovery there is certainly no shortage for Tim. With this in mind, we decided to postpone work on "A Pound Of Flesh" for the near future. We will return to it one day when Tim is better." 
In the same e-mail newsletter, Steven announced that Chris Catalyst had left The Scaramanga Six to concentrate on his band Eureka Machines (leaving them as a quartet again) and that the band had written a brand new sixth studio album to replace "A Pound Of Flesh". The band would begin recording this new album at the end of October and would also be scheduling a tour for the same time.
On December 17, 2008, the band released a live radio sessions album called "Hot Flesh Rumble". This contained their radio session recordings from the previous few years, featuring "gritty versions of songs from all the previous albums as well as the first recorded release of many of the songs from the postponed "A Pound Of Flesh"." On the same day, the band announced that their new album would be called "Songs Of Prey" and was being produced by James Kenosha (who'd previously worked with Duels, Grammatics and This et al.) for a release in the first quarter of 2009.
"Songs Of Prey" & "Cursed" (2009–2010).
"Songs Of Prey" was released on 20 April 2009, with the band playing a short British tour (plus an appearance in Denmark) to promote it. The album was once again well received by the alternative press, with "This Is Fake DIY" describing it as "cinematic art-rock that combines thrashing guitars with orchestral and distinctly non-rock instruments to create something individual and that has instant replay value... This is pop music that's not only absurd but pop music that's aware of the inherent absurdities of creating pop music. Yes, there's moments where you feel that the most appropriate action to take whilst listening to the record is to thrust your fist in the air in a stadium rock fashion, but somehow this bombast is endearing, where we would expect it to be off-putting." "The Yorkshire Evening Post" also hailed it as "a riff-heavy, ballsy heavy rock album that mixes up the stirring bombast of Rainbow and the compelling muscularity of Queens Of The Stone Age, yet still throws in enough musical and lyrical curveballs to lift it out of the ordinary. With vocals that are part dive-bar crooner and part righteous rocker, theatrical overtones and gothic undercurrents, the album is overblown, intense and great fun." On 13 June, the band announced the release of promotional video clips for two of the songs from the album, "Misadventure" and "Back To School".
In May 2010, the band began recording new sessions at 2Fly Studios in Sheffield with producer Alan Smythe. The band went on to play more concerts in England and Scandinavia, with Steve Gilchrist filling in for the absent Gareth Champion. In a blog posting on November 22, 2010, Paul Morricone revealed that the band had completely reworked and re-recorded the material originally written for the shelved album "A Pound of Flesh" and would release it as a brand new album, "Cursed" (featuring a guest appearance from Thomas Truax).
In December 2010, The Scaramanga Six contributed two songs to the "Leader of the Starry Skies" project (a fundraising compilation album initiative to benefit the hospitalised Cardiacs leader and Scaramanga Six producer Tim Smith). The band's version of Cardiacs' "Home of Fadeless Splendour" appeared on "", while their version of Cardiacs' "Everything is Easy" appeared on the limited-edition companion volume "Leader of the Starry Skies - A Loyal Companion".
Related projects.
The Morricone brothers have several musical side projects. As well as their occasional acoustic duo The Disclaimers, they have two ongoing collaborative projects with ex-Landspeed Loungers songwriter Dave Cooke - the song-based Being 747 and its alter-ego From Amoeba to Zebra (the latter designed specifically as a schools educational project to teach children about natural history and evolution). 
Steven Morricone also plays saxophone in Leeds psychedelic dance-rock band Kava Kava. He played bass in Eureka Machines (with Chris Catalyst) until leaving in early 2009. 
Paul Morricone started a second acoustic project - this time solo and under his own name - in mid-2009. He continues to maintain a parallel successful career with Poison Pen Films. He has created music video clips for The Young Knives, Graham Coxon, The Holloways, The Pigeon Detectives, Larrikin Love, Marvin, My Passion, The Whip, The Go Team, Little Man Tate, iLIKETRAiNS, Cold War Kids, Forward Russia, Gallows and Polytechnic as well as viral animations for The Charlatans.

Cristina Elena Grigoraş

Cristina Elena Grigoraş (born 11 February 1966) is a retired Romanian artistic gymnast. She is a two-time Olympic medalist with the team (gold in 1984 and silver in 1980). Individually, she won four medals (vault, all around, uneven bars and floor) at the 1981 European Championships. She is best known for a skill on the balance beam named after her: forward salto tucked with ½ twist (180°) take off from both legs.
Gymnastics career.
Grigoraş trained at CSS Cetate Deva with Márta and Béla Károlyi until their defection to USA in 1981 and with coaches Adrian Goreac, Adrian Stan, Maria Cosma and Octavian Belu after 1981.
1980 and the Olympic Games.
Her senior debut in an international event was at the 1980 Italian-Romanian meet where she placed first with the team and second all-around. Her participation at the 1980 World Cup in Toronto brought her a bronze medal on vault. She also placed fourth all around ahead of teammate Emilia Eberle, fifth on floor and eight on balance beam. Together with Nadia Comăneci, Rodica Dunca, Emilia Eberle, Melita Ruhn and Dumitriţa Turner, Grigoraş was a member of the silver medal team at the 1980 Olympics. At these Olympic games she did not compete in any individual final event.
1981.
At the 1981 European Championships in Madrid, Spain, Grigoraş medaled in all events except the balance beam. She won silver in the all around behind Maxi Gnauck, gold on vault, silver on uneven bars, bronze on floor and she placed eighth on beam. Her results in the all around and the events finals were the highest among her team members. In 1981 she also won the Champions All Trophy and was a team member at the 1981 World Championships in Moscow. At these World Championships she placed fourth with the team and fifth in the all around and uneven bars events. Once again her result in the all around was the highest among the Romanian team.
1982-1984 and the Olympic Games.
In 1982 Grigoraş did not compete at all. She returned to gymnastics events in 1983, but she was only an alternate in the team at the 1983 World Championships. In 1984 she won several medals for all around at some minor international events. In 1984 Grigoraş went with the team to Los Angeles to compete at the 1984 Olympic Games. The other members of the team were Lavinia Agache, Laura Cutina, Simona Păucă, Mihaela Stănuleţ, and Ecaterina Szabo. She contributed to the team gold medal and she placed eighth in the preliminaries of the all around event.
Retirement.
Grigoraş' last event appears to be the 1985 Dutch Romanian meet. After she retired Grigoraş went to Athens, Greece, to coach gymnastics.

1890–91 Everton F.C. season

Other members of the title winning squad.
Having finished the previous season as runners up Everton made just one signing of note during the summer when William Campbell was brought from Bootle to fill the centre half role, which had remained unsettled sinceGeorge Farmer had been dropped the previous November. Robert Smalley's position in goal was also under threat from an emerging twenty year old Scot named Jack Angus while David Kirkwood having lost the battle to secure the inside right birth to Alec Brady, now shared the centre back duties with Charlie Parry
This settled look ensured that there were just two new faces in the opening day 4–1 victory at West Bromwich Albion, Campbell, who scored and Angus who kept goal in the side listed above as the most settled team used that season. The team remained unchanged through the first four games of the campaign, which were all won, before Latta missed the fifth game. Everton still won to take their winning start to five games before being held to a 2–2 draw at Aston Villa. Everton remained unbeaten for their first seven games but their first choice eleven did not play again as a run of three straight defeats saw the return of Robert Smalley for one game in place of Jack Angus, who died in 1891, becoming the only player ever to win a posthumous League champion's medal. It's not recorded whether Angus showed signs of an illness before being replaced in goal but Everton went out in November and signed David Jardine from Bootle as a replacement, being first choice keeper by the season's end. 
Everton completed all bar one of their fixtures before the end of January and had to wait while the nearest challengers for the title, Preston played a series of games to close the gap at the top to two points. Everton's final game of the season was at Burnley on Saturday 14 March 1891 when almost half the 10,000 attendance was made up of visiting Everton fans. The team of Jardine, McLean, Doyle, Lochhead, Holt, Parry, Latta, Brady, Geary, Chadwick and Milward required only a draw but failed, losing 3–2. Preston would themselves have claimed a third consecutive title has they won their fixture at Sunderland but Evertonians, returning to Liverpool by train from Burnley were met with a delighted crowd at the station who informed them that Preston had lost 0–3 and that Everton had won the title for the first time.
There was no official honour for individual players for being crowned champions so the Everton directors had a medal minted for every player, including the now deceased Angus to mark the occasion. The Football League took up the idea the following year and medals have been presented to every championship winning side since.
Achievements.
Despite being crowned champions the 1890/91 team actually picked up fewer points than the side who missed out on the title the previous season. Their title triumph came despite a record losing and winless away run in the middle of the season. The 1891 title side also equalled or set the following club records.

Brooksley Born

Brooksley E. Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were opposed by other regulators. Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.
Early life and education.
Born graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961. She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.
She then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class. She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the "Outstanding Senior" award and graduated at the top of her class in 1964.
Legal career.
Immediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz. 
Born's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice. 
Born was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first “Women and the Law” course at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present. Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time. Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center.
During her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much "pro bono" and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States. Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming Chairperson. Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA. She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named Chair of the committee. As Chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 1993 Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, although ultimately Janet Reno was nominated.
In July 2009 Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).
Born and the OTC Derivatives Market.
Born was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994 by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System, the OCC, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any. CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC’s concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a "legal uncertainty" regarding such financial instruments, hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would "stifle financial innovation" and encourage financial capital to transfer its transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies, insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.
In 1998, a trillion dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse. Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions. The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures. Born stated, "I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about". In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance. After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted. In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy. U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked "How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?" In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that "the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them. Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: "Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did." Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress. Born resigned on June 1, 1999.
The derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets. As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators. 
Born declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: "The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been." She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.
An October 2009 Frontline documentary titled "The Warning" described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: "I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience."
In 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the "political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed to the current global financial crisis". According to Caroline Kennedy, "...Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of powerful and well connected interests... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have proved them and Sheila Bair right." One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated "I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know", adding that "I could have done much better. I could have made a difference" in response to her warnings.
In 2010, a documentary film "Inside Job" further alleged that the crafting of derivatives regulation was flawed from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also aggressively rebuked by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the marginalized voices arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.
Personal life.
Born is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter). She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part time so she could raise her two young children. When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.

Borgarting Court of Appeal

Borgarting Court of Appeal () is the court of appeal located in Oslo, Norway. It serves the counties of Oslo, Buskerud, Østfold and southern Akershus. The court has 62 judges and 45 administrative staff. The court is administrated by the Norwegian National Courts Administration.
The courthouse dates to 2005 and is an eleven story building—four stories of court rooms, six of meeting rooms and one with meeting rooms—with additional court rooms in an adjoining preserved building from the early 20th century. The building is located near St. Olavs Plass in the city center.
History.
The Borgarting is first mentioned in sources in 1047 as a thing for the counties around the Oslofjord, eventually expanding as far as into Grenland and Båhuslen. The thing was held at Borg. Its laws were codified by King Magnus VI in 1276, when ten judges were appointed. By the fourteenth century, Oslo, Grenland and Båhuslen had their own courts, each with their own presiding judge, and Borgarting was left with Vestfold and Østfold, with the judge seat moving to Tønsberg. In the fifteenth century the seat was moved across the fjord to Sarpsborg, and in 1567 to Fredrikstad. From 1797 Borgarting was renamed Fredrikshald after the city of the same name, and Oslo was renamed Kristiania.
In 1797 the four "stiftsoverrett" were created as courts of appeal. Akershus Court of Appeal was located in Oslo (at the time called Christiania) and responsible for Eastern Norway. The current structure with six courts of appeal and their names dates from 1890, with small changes to the structure of the districts in 1936. At the same time the "overrett" ("high court") disappeared. These three courts had been above the courts of appeal, but had used written, instead of oral, procedures.

Beausoleil First Nation

The Beausoleil First Nation is an mainly Ojibwa (Chippewa) First Nation located in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. There are still people on Christian Island today who claim Odawa parentage. Odawa identity is often submerged in that of the more numerous Ojibwa. In modern accounts they are often ignored as a separate people. On Christian Island itself the band's billboard states that it is a reserve of Ojibwa and Potawatomi people. Only on the Manitoulin Island Reserve of Wikwemikong do Odawa numbers warrant recognition by officials of their separate status. Their small numbers on mixed reserves in the province has made the Odawa something of a "forgotten or at least disregarded people" in Ontario today. Though small in numbers, they remain among the population of native peoples in Simcoe County and the District of Muskoka.
Reserve lands.
The Beausoleil First Nations occupies three Indian reserves. Their main Indian Reserve is the Christian Island 30 Indian Reserve, consisting of Christian Island, a large island in Georgian Bay close to the communities of Penetanguishene and Midland, Ontario, along with two other smaller islands. Together with the Christian Island 30A Indian Reserve located at Cedar Point, Ontario and the Chippewa Island Indian Reserve located in Twelve Mile Sound, north of Christian Island, they form the land base for the Beausoleil First Nation. In September 2008, the Beausoleil First Nation had registered a population of 1798 people, of which 579 people lived on these Reserves.
Governance.
The First Nation elect their leadership through the Act Electoral System for a two-year term. The First Nation's council consists of a chief and six (6) councillors. The current chief is Roland Monague Sr. The First Nation is a member of Ogemawahj Tribal Council, a regional Chiefs' council.

Diplocaulobium validicolle

Diplocaulobium validicolle is a species of orchid. Its common name is the Strong-stemmed Diplocaulobium.
It is found in New Guinea in lowland forests as a small to medium sized, intermediate to hot growing epiphyte. The plants are crowded with oblong pseudobulbs carrying a single erect leaf. Blooms appear on a single inflorescence arising through a 5-10mm long sheath. The flowers are 6 to 7 cm in diameter.
The plants are cultivated in intermediate to warm conditions mounted on cork slabs or in small pots with medium bark and need high humidity. No specific winter rest is needed. The plants can flower all year, but tend to get a flush of flowers in spring and autumn, where many flowers appear at once. The odd single flower can appear all year. What is extraordinary is that the plants only flower for a few hours, and that the inflorescences take only a few days from peeking through the sheath to flowering. This makes it hard to see plants flowering.

Penwortham Priory

Penwortham Priory was first a Benedictine priory and, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, a country house in the village of Penwortham, near Preston, Lancashire. The house was demolished as the village expanded into a town and a housing estate has replaced the mansion house and its grounds of which no trace remain.
History.
Before 1086, William the Conqueror gave this area of Lancashire to his relative, Roger the Poitevin. A small castle was built on the hill in Penwortham overlooking the river crossing and the castle mound (the motte) can still be seen behind St Mary's church. Roger gave land to the Benedictine Evesham Abbey and a small daughter cell was built at Penwortham, starting in 1075. The priory, dedicated to Saint Mary, had no independence from Evesham but functioned until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1535.
Mansion.
The priory and its lands were sold to the Fleetwood family at a price of £3,088. The Fleetwoods built a mansion which became known as Penwortham Priory and lived there from the Dissolution until 1749.
The Rawsthorne family lived at the Priory from 1783 until it was demolished in 1925. The Rawsthornes employed architect, George Webster, to redesign the priory in the mid-19th century.
Penwortham Priory became a victim of the expansion of Penwortham in the 1920s, when it was demolished to make way for housing. The Lodge was taken down in 1912 and rebuilt in Moss Lane, Hutton.

No. 258 Squadron RAF

RAF 258 Squadron was a Royal Air Force squadron during World War I and World War II.
History.
World War I.
No. 258 Squadron was first formed 25 July 1918 from 523, 525 and 529 Special Duties Flights at Luce Bay near Stranraer, Scotland under the control of No. 25 Group. It was equipped with De Havilland DH.6 biplanes and carried out anti-submarine patrols over the Irish Sea. It was disbanded on 5 March 1918.
World War II.
The squadron was reformed on 20 November 1940 at RAF Leconfield, Yorkshire as a fighter squadron equipped with Hawker Hurricanes. First based at RAF Acklington they relocated to RAF Jurby, Isle of Man. By April 1941, No. 258 Squadron's time had Jurby had come to an end, and they transferred to RAF Valley and thence to RAF Kenley in preparation to take the offensive to the enemy. In October they were stood down to prepare for a move to the Far East. After a few days in Singapore they were withdrawn to Sumatra and then Java, where they suffered many losses either killed or captured by the Japanese. The survivors transferred their aircraft to No. 605 squadron and most attempted to escape by ship to Australia, but unfortunately all the ships were sunk en route with no survivors.
The squadron was again reformed 1 Mar 1942 from G Squadron at Ratmalana Airport, near Colombo, Ceylon but suffered severe losses during the Japanese carrier strike on 5 April 1942. After a spell in Burma (under Neil Cameron) the squadron was withdrawn to be re-equipped with American Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. In June 1945 it then began training for the invasion of Malaya but on the Japanese surrender the squadron was finally disbanded on 31 December 1945.
The squadron was largely manned by RNZAF pilots from New Zealand.

2008–09 Belgian financial crisis

The 2008–2009 Belgian financial crisis is a major financial crisis that hit Belgium from mid-2008 onwards. Two of the country's largest banks – Fortis and Dexia – started to face severe problems, exacerbated by the financial problems hitting other banks around the world. The value of their stocks plunged. The government managed the situation by bailouts, selling off or nationalizing banks, providing bank guarantees and extending the deposit insurance. Eventually Fortis was split into two parts. The Dutch part was nationalized, while the Belgian part was sold to the French bank BNP Paribas. Dexia group was dismantled, Dexia Bank Belgium was nationalized.
Context.
The global financial crisis and the credit crunch shocked trust across the board. At the time of bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Belgium was in a long simmering political crisis. The Flemish and French communities were at odds with one another, especially after the electoral gains of the Flemish separatist party N-VA. The fear of Belgium splitting into two worsened the trust situation. Most of the events took place during the Leterme I, Van Rompuy I and Leterme II Governments. Didier Reynders was finance minister in all of them. The government was assisted by CBFA and the Court of Audit.
Historically Belgium has had a high public debt, which in 1993 peaked at 137.8% GDP. In order to be able to join the eurozone this was greatly reduced to around 100% GDP at the turn of the century. This budgetary discipline was continued after the introduction of the euro, in part to comply with the Maastricht Treaty. By 2007 the public debt of Belgium had dropped to 84% GDP. The reduced debt increased Belgium's ability to cope with the situation. The government interventions in the financial sector, and deficit spending at a time of economic slowdown has had an impact on the government debt, rising again to 99.6% GDP in 2012.
There is a degree of pillarisation in Belgium. Dexia belonged to the Catholic Pillar, Ethias belongs to the socialist Pillar.
Bank crises.
Fortis.
Fortis was the largest Belgian bank in early 2008, positioned mainly in the Benelux. From mid-2008 onwards, the bank began facing severe liquidity problems and its stock value began rapidly declining. The problem was exacerbated by the earlier acquisition of the Dutch bank ABN Amro, which had depleted Fortis' capital. Since the beginning of 2008, about 3% of the deposits stalled at the bank were withdrawn. Belgian and Dutch ministers and financial regulators met each other on 27 September to tackle the crisis.
The following day, Fortis was partially nationalised on September 28, 2008, with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg investing a total of €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion) in the bank. Belgium will purchase 49% of Fortis's Belgian banking division, with the Netherlands doing the same for the Dutch banking division. Luxembourg has agreed to a loan convertible into a 49% share of Fortis's Luxembourg banking division.
On 3 October the Dutch government purchased the Dutch banking and insurance division of Fortis for €16.8 billion ($23.3 billion), becoming the holder of Fortis Bank Nederland, Fortis Verzekeringen Nederland and Fortis Corporate Insurance, including the part of ABN Amro held by Fortis. BNP Paribas, a French bank, took a majority stake in Fortis, while Belgian and Luxembourg governments became minority shareholders with blocking power in exchange for shares in BNP Paribas. The deal does not include the main holding company, but does include the insurance and banking subsidiaries, except for Fortis Insurance International. Dutch and Belgian shareholders' associations have requested a review of the takeover.
Toxic assets were placed in a bad bank called "Royal Park Investments". Thanks in part to good management and multi billion euro guarantees by the government the holding performed better than expected. In April 2013 it was sold for 2.3 billion euro to the American investment firm "Lone Star". This was good news for public finances (1 billion euro) and the Fortis holding since renamed to Ageas.
Dexia.
On 30 September 2008 the Belgian, French and Luxembourg governments said they would put in €6.4bn to keep Dexia afloat.
The problems at Dexia stem in part from a multi-billion loan to troubled German bank Depfa and potential losses at its US subsidiary FSA. The Dexia board stated on 5 October 2008 that the capital addition by the governments would put it in a position in which it could deal with deteriorating market conditions, and that the credit risks associated with Hypo Real Estate and Depfa are only limited.
Market conditioned worsened over the following years, generating losses. On the sale of FSA, due to the fall of Lehman brother and Icelandic banks and finally due to a large exposure to the Greek government-debt crisis.
Eventually, in October 2011, the group was dismantled Dexia bank Belgium was bought by the Belgian federal government for 4 billion euro and changed its name to Belfius. Other healthy components were also sold off and the toxic assets remained in the Dexia Holding. Dexia holding is Europe's largest bad bank. Operating with the help of bank guarantees of the Belgian and French governments Dexia holding is tasked to minimize the losses on its toxic assets. 
The holding is still generating large losses, which led Belgium and France to inject another €5.5 billion in 2012.
KBC.
Since the beginning of October 2008, the price of KBC shares had dropped by more than half. The turbulence on the international financial markets and the skewed domestic situation after the government bail-out of its two largest competitors had increased the pressure.
On Saturday 25 October, KBC was reported to be in talks with the Belgian government, hoping to obtain a €3.5 billion cash injection. The company, which is also active in Central Europe, fears the adverse impact of the financial woes hitting that region. The deal was approved. The extra cash was used to increase its risk buffer.
Because KBC is seen by the Walloons as a mainly Flemish bank, the federal government was unwilling to participate in a second intervention. 
In January 2009, the Flemish government stepped in KBC for €2 billion. In addition KBC was allowed to issue bonds to the Flemish government for up to 1.5 billion euro.
When the credit rating of MBIA an American insurer, which specializes in bond insuring, was downgraded to junk this negatively impacted the value KBC's risky assets. A third agreement was made. Mid-May 2009 the federal government announced it will offer bank guarantees for up to 2 billion euro.
In 2012 KBC made a profit of 612 million euro. By the end of that year, and ahead of schedule, KBC had paid back all of the 3.5 billion euro of support from the federal government. It also plans to pay back the support from the Flemish government at an accelerated pace, starting with 1.17 billion in 2013.
Government reaction.
Besides the bail-outs of both Fortis and Dexia, the government also guaranteed all bank savings up to €20,000. This limit was later raised to €100,000. On Saturday 11 October, the government announced that all banks, including the smaller ones, could obtain a similar guarantee on the condition that they are solvent and pay a fee.
The government also negotiated in deals to protect the savings of the 16,000 Belgian customers of the Icelandic Kaupthing Bank whose money was locked up for months following the crisis in Iceland. They belonged to the subsidiary Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg. Which was finally taken over by "Blackfish Capital" the Belgian accounts were taken over by Crelan. Which later also took over "Centea" part of the activities KBC had to shed from the European Comission as compensation for the government support.
When in late 2011 the interest rates on Belgian government bonds rose to irrational heights the government asked for support from the population and promoted the "staatsbon". The "staatsbon" is a government bond that can be easily purchased at banks without any knowledge of the stock exchange. The long term rates on the international markets briefly spiked above 5.5%. The consumer purchasable bonds offered gross interests rates of 3.5%, 4%, 4.2% depending on the runtime of 3, 5 or 8 years. This was twice that of a standard savings account. The attractive rate, and the promotion resulted in a success. This way the government managed to borrow 5.68 billion euro below market rates. Colloquially this iteration of the "staatsbon" is referred to as the Leterme-staatsbon after then Prime minister Yves Leterme. Shortly after the measure, and with a new government finally being formed the interest rates started to drop. Early 2013 even to the lowest level they had been since the introduction of the euro(below 2%). Allowing them to be resold at a profit.
Stock market reaction.
The BEL-20 stock index lost more than 20% of its value during the week of 6–10 October, making it the largest weekly decline in the stock index' history. At the time Fortis, Dexia and KBC stocks made up 29.78% of the weighted index.

Ruatara, ("circa" 1787 - 3 March 1815) was a chief of the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe) in New Zealand. He introduced European crops to New Zealand and was host to the first Christian missionary, Samuel Marsden.
Ruatara belonged to the chiefly line of the Hikutu hapu within the Ngāpuhi iwi. He was also the nephew of Hongi Hika. Ruatara's pā was at Rangihoua on the northern shore of the Bay of Islands. Rangihoua had been Te Pahi's pā until his death at the hand of whalers who wrongly accused him of being responsible for the Boyd Massacre.
In 1805, he first attempted to travel abroad, and signed up as a sailor on a whaling ship, the "Argo", but was cheated and stranded in Sydney the following year by its captain. Undeterred, he signed up on the sealing vessel "Santa Anna" in 1807. He reached London in 1809, where he stayed for a little over two weeks before returning to Sydney. There, he studied British agricultural practices and met Samuel Marsden, before finally returning to New Zealand in 1812, and succeeding the recently deceased Te Puhi as leader of the Ngapuhi. He introduced wheat to his compatriots, along with a mill to grind it, given to him by Marsden. By 1814, he had "laid the foundations of a flourishing wheat industry"; the 1966 "Encyclopedia of New Zealand" described him as "possess considerable business acumen", although his plans to set up a steady export industry were cut short by his death shortly thereafter.
On 25 December 1814, he and Hongi Hika welcomed Marsden and Thomas Kendall on Ngāpuhi land, and hosted his Christian mission station, the first to be established in New Zealand. Ruatara thus "secured a monopoly over the first permanent European settlement in New Zealand, a goose that would reliably lay eggs of iron, if not gold. He had also introduced Christianity into the country as a side effect. Ruatara's Māori neighbours were left in no doubt about who ran the new mission station or about who was the new rising star of the Bay of Islands." Through the mission, he obtained European plants, tools and pistols, "distributing European goods and knowledge" to Maori and thus increasing his mana (power, influence, prestige). He never converted to Christianity himself.
Ruatara described Marsden and Kendall as "his Pākehā", and was their protector for the remaining months of his life; he died on 3 March 1815, following a month-long "raging fever". His uncle Hongi Hika would continue to host Marsden's mission until his (Hongi Hika's) own death in 1828.

Ronnie Boon

Ronald Winston "Ronnie" Boon (11 June 1909 – 3 August 1998) was an international rugby union wing for Wales who played club rugby for Cardiff. Boon possessed a tremendous self-confidence in his own ability and this was reflected in his nickname "Cocky". Boon was a quick runner, representing Wales at the 220-yard sprint, and was an excellent drop kicker. He is best known in Welsh rugby as the man who scored all seven points in 1933 against England to end the 'Twickenham bogey', and along with Jack Morley is seen as one of the greatest Welsh wings since the country's first Golden Era of rugby.
Rugby career.
Boon began his career at Barry Parade Club, before playing at schoolboy level with Barry Grammar and then representing Wales for Welsh Secondary Schools. Boon played for several club teams, including London Welsh which he would become club secretary during most of the 1960s, but spent the majority of his time at Cardiff. He joined the blues during the 1928/29 season, and by 1930 he was selected to represent Wales in a Five Nations Championship match against Scotland in an all-Cardiff three-quarter line alongside Davies, Jones and Turnbull. Wales lost the match, and although Boon missed the next game against Ireland he had impressed some quarters of the sporting press. 'Old Stager' reported that Boon's covering tackling against Scotland's Ian Smith had been impressive and that he had shown an '...extraordinary facility for retaining a grasp on whatever part of his anatomy he could lay his hands'. For the final game against France, Boon's Wales rival Jack Morley had been selected to play for the British Lions, so Boon was reselected in a notoriously aggressive match which resulted in a Welsh win.
Boon played in all of the 1931 Five Nations Championship which saw Wales win the tournament for the first time in eight years. Under the captaincy of Jack Bassett, Wales won three of the games, and drew against England. Boon scored his first international try during the campaign in the game against Scotland, though he was forced to work hard for his score due to the poor distribution of Claude Davey. The next season Boon was selected to face the touring South Africans, but the game was played in atrocious icy weather and after Wales lost Bassett was blamed for not switching his team's style of play to accommodate the conditions. Boon was reselected for the 1932 Home Nations Championship and Wales won their two opening matches against England and Scotland, Boon scoring a try in both games and also managed a 'freak' drop goal in the England match. Wales lost the final game against Ireland, robbing them of a successive championship crown.
In 1931, having qualified as a teacher, Boon left Wales to study at Dunfermline College of Education, before teaching at Dunfermline High School, while in Scotland he turned out for Dunfermline, though would still play for Cardiff when ever he could. In 1933 Boon was chosen to face England at Twickenham, a stadium Wales had failed to win at in ten attempts. Captained by Watcyn Thomas, Boon later argued that the Welsh forwards deserved all the credit for the Welsh victory even though Boon scored all the Welsh points in a 7–3 victory. At half-time, England led the game 3–0 with a try from Walter Elliot; but soon after the restart, England's Ronald Gerrard kicked a loose ball across the ground straight into Boon's arms, and he calmly drop kicked the ball through the posts to take a 4–3 lead. A few minutes later Boon had extended the lead when the ball came back from a maul to Davey, who passed to Boon, and with the English defence out of position, he crossed at the corner and touched the ball down behind the posts for a try. Vivian Jenkins converted the try which was registered on the score board, but strangely the referee would later disallow the attempt after the game. The decision did not change the result, and Wales had finally beaten the 'Twickenham bogey' and Boon was hailed as a Welsh hero. Boon missed the next game against Scotland due to a knee injury but was back to face Ireland. Wales lost the game and the Welsh selectors dropped 11 of the squad from future fixtures. Those that never played for Wales again after that game included Watcyn Thomas, Arthur Lemon, Harry Bowcott, Lonza Bowdler and Boon himself.
International matches played.
Wales
Cricket career.
Before his move to Dunfermline, Boon tried out at cricket for Glamorgan. He played just eleven first class games, bowling only 11 overs and averaging just 13.47 with the bat.
Territorial Army.
Shortly after his move to Scotland, Boon was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 56th (Highland) Medium Brigade, Royal Artillery, Territorial Army on 3 May 1933, He was and promoted to lieutenant on 3 May 1936. He transferred to 227th Anti-Aircraft Battery on 1 February 1938, but with his move south to Brighton, transferred to the TA reserve of officers, on the list of 71st (Forth) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Although he remained in the reserve until 30 September 1959 when he reached the age limit for service, he does not appear to have served in the Second World War, presumably because teaching was a reserved occupation. He also represented the TA at rugby.
Later life.
Boon stayed at Dunfermline until 1938, before heading south to Brighton. He would later become an inspector of schools and after returning to Wales became a councillor for South Glamorgan County Council. Boon kept his links with rugby and as well as becoming secretary of London Welsh from 1961 to 1969, he also became president of Barry RFC and served on the Sports Council of Wales. Boon emigrated to New Zealand in 1995 and died there in 1998.

Digvijay Narain Singh

Digvijay Narain Singh was an eminent politician and Parliamentarian belonging to the Indian National Congress and represented Vaishali constituency in Bihar state for 28 consecutive years (1952–1980). He was born in a Bhumihar Brahmin family and was a scion of Dharhara, one of the richest Zamindaris in Bihar. But he spent a lot of his inherited wealth for public good and never took any money from his party, the Indian National Congress for fighting elections. He was a close friend of Sir Mark Tully, who contributed one whole chapter on him in "No Full Stops in India". He was close friend of both Feroze Gandhi and Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai treated him like his son. He died at Patna on 2 August 1991 at the age of 67 years
Changing the pattern of paying obeisance, famous parliamentarian Digvijay Narain Singh opened the doors of the Durga Mandir at Dharhara, Muzaffarpur, to common people. "Each year during Puja, over 1.50 lakh villagers come for darshan, with women coming especially for the "khoicha" ritual. Cultural functions are organized here during Navaratra. Animal sacrifice is not performed here.

Technology in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The fictional universe of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series by Douglas Adams is a galaxy-spanning society of interacting extraterrestrial cultures. The technological level in the series is highly advanced, though often unreliable. Many technologies in the series are used to poke fun at modern life.
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation.
Most of the technology mentioned in the series are products of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, a decidedly inept company responsible for the design and creation of a wide range of robots and labour-saving devices, such as lifts, automatic doors, ventilation systems, and the infamous Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser. In , the problem with all the corporation's products was summarised by the Guide:
The only profitable division of the company is its Complaints division, which, according to the series, takes up all of the major landmasses on the first three planets in the Sirius Tau system. The theme song for the Complaints division is Share and Enjoy, and has since become the theme apparent for the company as a whole. The main office building and headquarters for the company was originally built to represent this motto, but due to bad architecture it sank halfway into the ground, leaving the upper halves of the motto's words to read in the local language "Go Stick Your Head in a Pig."
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation invented a concept called "Genuine People Personalities" ("GPP") which imbue their products with intelligence and emotion. Thus not only do doors open and close, but they thank their users for using them, or sigh with the satisfaction of a job well done. Other examples of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation's record with sentient technology include an armada of neurotic elevators, hyperactive ships' computers and perhaps most famously of all, Marvin the Paranoid Android. Marvin is a prototype for the GPP feature, and his depression and "terrible pain in all the diodes down his left side" are due to unresolved flaws in his programming.
The Corporation is also mentioned in the radio serial of "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul". They are also listed in the instructions to the Atari Jaguar game "Alien vs Predator" as a manufacturer of medical equipment.
By-products of Designer People.
During the backstory "Young Zaphod Plays it Safe", the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation designed and produced synthetic personalities to order, but they turned out to be the "By-products of Designer People - amalgams of characteristics which simply could not co-exist in naturally occurring life forms". Some of these were dangerous as they did not alert people to their dangerousness. The starship "Billion Year Bunker" contained three of these in the hold, on their way to being blasted out of the universe - but one had escaped to Earth, "the man babbling gently about a shining city on a hill"; later revised editions clarify the reference by describing the figure as "a Reagan", in other words Ronald Reagan.
Doors.
Doors manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation are programmed to love their simple lives; they love nothing more than to open and close for passing users, and thank them profusely for so emphatically validating their existence. Most characters in the series grow to loathe the doors, particularly Marvin (and he was the first to explain about the doors' "cheerful and sunny dispositions").
Happy Vertical People Transporter.
The lifts in the "Hitchhiker's Guide" offices are called Happy Vertical People Transporters. As designed by the Corporation, they are meant to be sentient (enough to argue with) and have "defocused temporal perception." The latter concept is meant to enable the lifts to see far enough into the future to arrive at a floor before a potential passenger realises they wanted a lift, thus saving them from having to wait around and make friends like they would have to do normally.
The one lift with a voice appears in , voiced by David Tate. The lifts make a cameo appearance of sorts in and .
Matter transference beams.
The main means of teleportation encountered throughout the series, first used by a Dentrassi to transport Ford and Arthur onto a Vogon ship seconds before the Earth is destroyed. Ford explains that one probably loses some salt and protein when transported for the first time through a matter transference beam. In the "Hitchhiker's" game, this condition is fatal without eating peanuts. Used again in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, as the team try to escape from Hotblack Desiato's stuntship, they find a room, approximately 6–8 feet tall, with what resembles a multiple shower unit with half finished wiring tangled from the ceiling. Since there is no guidance programming and no automatic system, Marvin is forced to stay behind and operate the machine (he himself escapes by an artificially introduced Improbability Field). Arthur wakes up from the transport and states he has the worst headache imaginable.
Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser.
The Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser is a product of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. The Guide has this to say on the Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser:
In , the machine fails to produce tea altogether, in fact refusing to try, and taps Eddie's logic circuits to compute why Arthur wants tea at all; "Because I happen to like it" doesn't compute. With the help of the spirit of Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, Eddie eventually settles on the answer "because he's an ignorant monkey who doesn't know better", though this answer is not well received by Arthur.
In , on the other hand, Arthur Dent manages to freeze up a Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser (along with the rest of the spaceship they are on) by asking it to make him tea, due to the various servings of the terrible-tasting sludge he'd received from the machine during the entire trip. The Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser defined tea as "The taste of dried-up leaves boiled in water." After many hours of considerable thought with the help of Eddie it manages to produce real tea, which Arthur describes as "the best tea he's ever drunk".
In the film adaptation, a machine similar to the drinks dispenser appears, serving brown sludge into a plastic cocktail glass. However, it is not mentioned by name, nor does it engage Arthur in conversation. There is also a similar machine nearby that detects and produces - according to Trillian - "what you're craving." While still incapable of making tea, this machine does not in fact paralyze the ship's systems—that feat is instead accomplished by the hitchhiking mice who are, in fact, the pan-dimensional beings who activated Deep Thought for the second time.
Ships.
Billion Year Bunker.
The Starship "Billion Year Bunker" appeared in "Young Zaphod Plays it Safe". It was commissioned by the Galactic government to carry certain "by-products", such as aorist rods and biological weapons. It was meant to be almost indestructible and the cargo hold had been reinforced in many different ways. The crew was to steer the ship towards a black hole, where it would be sucked in and forever be destroyed. However, the captain took a detour to his home planet because he wanted some of the lobsters that were in abundance on the planet. The ship crashed into the water and split in two.
Blagulon Kappa policecraft.
In the , the Blagulon Kappa policecraft arrives to attempt to arrest Zaphod. However, Marvin, being "bored and depressed", plugs himself into the computer and "talkto it at great length; revealing [his entire view of the universe to it", whereupon "It suicide", fortunately taking its two Blagulon Kappan pilots with it, since they required their shipboard computer to run their personal life-support systems. 
Business End.
In , this is the ship of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz.
Golgafrincham B-Ark.
The Golgafrincham B-Ark was two miles long and capped by a bridge that offered a panoramic view of the stars. Its interior corridors were covered in brown Hessian wall-weave, and home to fifteen million unwanted "colonists" in cryonic suspension. The ship was built as part of an elaborate con to exile an unwitting third of Golgafrincham's population; convincing them their planet was doomed, the majority sent them off to another planet, which happened to be Earth. Upon completing its five-year journey, the ship crashed into a swamp, taking the vast majority of its sleeping passengers with it.
Heart of Gold.
"S.S. Heart of Gold" is the first prototype ship to successfully use the revolutionary Infinite Improbability Drive. It is 150 metres long and has been represented in various shapes. The original radio series did not specify a shape. In the novel adapted from the first four episodes of the radio series, it was described as a sleek white running shoe, which the TV adaptation adopted as a basis for its depictions. In the 2005 movie, it is more spherical with a hole and red brake lights on the rear that form the shape of a heart, a shape derived from a teacup in the brownian motion producer that powers the Infinite Improbability Drive. It also features a mural around the hole which depicts the invention of the Drive. It was built as a secret government project on planet Damogran from where Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then-President of the Imperial Galactic Government, stole it at the launching ceremony.
The ship's cybernetics consist of a new generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers with Genuine People Personalities (including Eddie the shipboard computer and Marvin).
In , it is revealed that the core of the Improbability Drive is actually the Golden Bail of Prosperity, one of five items that forms the Wikkit Gate. The drive is subsequently stolen by the robots of Krikkit, but it is later recovered by Zaphod Beeblebrox and reinstalled.
Starship Bistromath.
Slartibartfast's ship in . The ship is said to work by abusing the laws of 'bistromathics', which is the specific mathematics of values of various factors in restaurants, such as the bill, number of people attending, number of people said to be attending, number of people who leave and the time they all arrive. In , bistromathics is explained that "Just as Einstein observed that space was not an absolute, but depended on the observer's movement in time, so it was realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants."
The ship's appearance was described as having some of the features of a spaceship (guidance fins, rocket nozzles, escape hatches, etc.), but far more strongly resembling "a small upended Italian bistro."
Starship Titanic.
A majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol. Its designers included an early form of Infinite Improbability Drive, theorising that it would then be Infinitely Improbable that anything bad would happen to it. Unfortunately, the nature of the Infinite Improbability Drive means that anything Infinitely Improbable was now bound to happen, and so the ship underwent a Total Existence Failure before it left the dock.
Vogon Constructor flagship.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship used in the destruction of Earth. It is described in the novels as being yellow, "huge as office block", and "not so much designed as congealed". Its interior is dark and squalid.
Drives.
Bistromathic drive.
The Bistromathic Drive is a starship propulsion system introduced in , the third book of the series.
The Bistromathic Drive is used in Slartibartfast's craft "Bistromath" and works by exploiting the irrational mathematics that apply to numbers on a waiter's bill pad and groups of people in restaurants. describes bistromathics as follows:
Further explanation of the theory behind bistromathics:
The bridge instruments of the Starship "Bistromath" are ensconced in fake wine bottles.
The central computational area is a fake Italian restaurant table with seating for twelve encased in a glass cage. The table is decked with a faded red and white check tablecloth with mathematically positioned cigarette burns. A group of robot customers sit round the table, attended by robot waiters.
The mathematics play themselves out in the complex interplay between continuously circulating keys, menus, watches, cheque books, credit cards, bill pads and scribblings on paper napkins.
Slartibartfast explains that ""On a waiter's bill pad, numbers dance. Reality and unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible."
Should the ship's captain sit at the table, the mathematical functions speed up; the customers become more vociferous and wave at each other. Eventually, the equation balances, and the customers become polite and civil once more. The more heated the argument, the more complex the equation, and the farther the ship may travel.
Effectively, the ship takes advantage of the strange rules that only restaurants operate under by turning itself into a controlled, artificial restaurant. This allows a ship equipped with a bistromathic drive to accomplish feats quite outside the normal capabilities of spacecraft, such as travelling two thirds across the galactic disk in a matter of seconds. The drive is notably more controllable than the Infinite Improbability Drive. It is also said to "make the "Heart of Gold" seem like an electric pram."
Hyperspace.
The Vogon ships use hyperspace travel to go faster than light. They also destroy Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Ford Prefect describes going into hyperspace as "rather unpleasantly like being drunk". When asked what's so unpleasant about being drunk, he replies, "You ask a glass of water."
Infinite Improbability Drive.
The Infinite Improbability Drive is a faster-than-light drive. The most prominent usage of the drive is in the starship "Heart of Gold". It is based on a particular perception of quantum theory: a subatomic particle is most likely to be in a particular place, such as near the nucleus of an atom, but there is also an infinitesimally small probability of it being found very far from its point of origin (for example close to a distant star). Thus, a body could travel from place to place without passing through the intervening space (or hyperspace, for that matter), if you had sufficient control of probability. According to the Guide, the drive "passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously," meaning that you are "never sure where you'll end up or even what species you'll be when they get there" and "it's therefore important to dress accordingly". In the 2005 film, for instance, the first time the Improbability Drive is used, the entire ship ends up as a giant ball of yarn for a few seconds, and the main characters are rendered as animated yarn dolls.
The Guide's entry on the drive also states that it was invented "following research into finite improbability, which was often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess' undergarments leap one foot simultaneously to the left, in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy". It further explains that many respectable physicists wouldn't stand for that sort of thing, "partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties."
The "Heart of Gold" was the prototype ship for infinitely improbable travel. It is the Infinite Improbability Drive in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" that saves Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect from very probable death by asphyxiation in deep space after being thrown out of the Vogon ship; the improbable odds against being rescued being 2276709 to one; the superscripted number incidentally being the telephone number of the Islington flat where Arthur went to a fancy dress party and first metand totally blew it withTrillian (in the film, the number is 2079460347, which is, oddly enough, a number in Battersea, Londonnot Islington). Incidentally, Adams explained in the annotated volume of the original radio scripts that it was the eviction of Arthur and Ford out the spacelock of the Vogon ship that led to his own "invention" of the Infinite Improbability Drive. Adams realised that he had worked the story into a dead end, thinking in frustration that the only solutions would be "infinitely improbable." In a flash of insight and what Adams called "mental jiujitsu", the Infinite Improbability Drive was born.
In the third book, the Infinite Improbability Drive is discovered to be the Golden Bail of Prosperity in the Wikkit Gate. It is stolen by the white Krikkit robots; however, it was returned and the "Heart of Gold" returned to operational status.
Adams developed the notion of the improbability drive having greater causal (and narrative) effects in later books. For example, when Zaphod's great-grandfather discusses his great grandson's career-to-date, he explains that Zaphod cannot escape his destiny now the improbability field "controls you".
Karey Kirkpatrick, who with Adams (before his death) adapted the novel for the screen in 2005, described the improbability drive as a "plot contrivance machine", allowing Adams to construct elaborate plotlines based on coincidences that would, in other narratives, be considered too improbable to be believed.
Phargilor Kangaroo Relocation Drive.
The Phargilor (or Penargilon) Kangaroo Relocation Drive appeared in - it can also be heard on . The drive allows, in an emergency, a ship to be ejected suddenly through the fabric of space time and come to rest far from the starting point, with the pilot rarely having time to plot where the ship will end up. Ford and Arthur use this drive to escape from the Haggunenons.
Weapons.
Kill-o-Zap blaster pistol.
The Kill-o-Zap is a weapon first appearing in , wielded by the police from Blagulon Kappa when they come to Magrathea to arrest Zaphod. It is referenced throughout the series in the role of a standard and widespread brand of raygun.
In it is described in more detail: 
In , the group arms themselves with Kill-o-Zap guns against the Krikkiters. Arthur "fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him. He was shaking so much that if he'd fired at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on them."
In the 2005 movie adaptation, the gun has a sophisticated look. It is more of a white sphere that covers the hand and has a trigger on the inside. This version is wielded by Marvin.
Point of View Gun.
The Point of View Gun is a device created by Douglas Adams for the movie version of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"; it does not appear in any of the previous versions of the story.
According to the film, the gun was created by Deep Thought prior to its long pondering of the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. When used on someone, it will cause them to see things from the point of view of the person firing the gun (the Guide says that it "conveniently, does precisely as its name suggests"). According to the Guide, though the gun was designed by Deep Thought, it was commissioned by the Intergalactic Consortium of Angry Housewives, who were tired of ending every argument with their husbands with the phrase: "You just don't get it, do you?"
This neatly mirrors the Total Perspective Vortex, an earlier plot device from the radio series and second novel, created by the character Trin Tragula to show his wife the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it.
Humma Kavula wants to obtain the gun in order to expand the influence of the religion he heads. He agrees to trade it with Zaphod Beeblebrox for the coordinates to Magrathea, but takes Zaphod's second head as collateral instead, as Zaphod doesn't have the gun at the time. When the gun is discovered inside Deep Thought, it is playfully used by Ford Prefect and Zaphod on one another, and eventually taken by Trillian who, wanting answers from Zaphod about Earth's destruction, uses it to interrogate him until he does so (In the movie adaptation, Zaphod authorised the destruction of Earth, thinking he was simply being asked for his autograph for a fan, and was completely unaware why Trillian was angry with him when she discovered this revelation). Following this, Zaphod threatens to fire the gun at Trillian, to which she scathingly replies that she is "already a woman" (implying that the gun only works on men, because women are sympathetic and thoughtful of others, and therefore can already see things from another's point of view).
Near the end of the film, Marvin the Paranoid Android uses the gun to save the crew of the "Heart of Gold" from hundreds of Vogons. After the Vogons see things from Marvin's chronically-depressed point of view, they all collapse, no longer finding a point to life.
There are seven holsters for Point of View Guns inside Deep Thought, but only one actual gun. The rest of the holsters are empty. At the end of the movie Arthur Dent possesses the gun, and Zaphod has not yet turned the gun over to Humma Kavula.
QUEST.
Quite Unwieldy Experimental Sublimation Torpedo, an experimental anti-god missile used by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz to attack the god Thor in . The Vogons bought the device from Zaphod, who reveals that he installed a lawnmower engine on it in a scheme to defraud them.
Supernova bomb.
Featured in "Life, the Universe and Everything", the supernova bomb is "a very very small bomb" that resembles a cricket ball, and is the greatest weapon of mass destruction ever created in the history of the universe. Initially designed by the supercomputer Hactar for the Silastic Armourfiends of Striterax, who had demanded that it create an "Ultimate Weapon" but forgot that computers take instructions literally, the bomb creates a path through hyperspace that connects all major suns together into one gigantic supernova, effectively destroying the entire universe. Hactar deliberately designed the bomb with a flaw that rendered it useless; when the Silastic Armourfiends discovered this, they smashed the computer into dust and then destroyed themselves through constant warfare.
Hactar's particulate form wrapped itself around the idyllic planet Krikkit, isolating it from the rest of the universe, and gradually re-engineered its society until they could recreate the bomb and fulfill Hactar's program. The Krikkiters were defeated in the Krikkit Wars, racial memories of which would lead to the invention of the game cricket on Earth. Billions of years later, they built Hactar's flawed bomb and tried to deploy it, leading to their discovery of the computer's influence on their evolution. Trillian noted that it was impossible for the Krikkiters to be smart enough to build this weapon on their own, yet stupid enough not to grasp that it would destroy them if they used it. Hactar created a fully functional duplicate of the bomb and hid it in a travel bag belonging to Arthur Dent, who very nearly caused it to explode before stopping it by accident at the last second.
Personal items.
Crisis Inducer.
A watch-like device that can create an artificial crisis situation of selectable severity, in order to sharpen the wits of the user. Carried by Lintilla in .
Digital watches.
Earth's population are described in the first novel as "so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea." When Arthur Dent loses his left arm as a consequence of the Infinite Improbability Drive, he panics upon realising he can no longer operate his digital watch. Hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings built the supercomputer Deep Thought in part to comprehend why people spend so much of their lives wearing digital watches. In the 1970s, when the series was first composed, digital watches were the height of techno-fashion. For , references to digital watches were replaced by mobile telephones.
Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses.
Designed to help the wearer develop a relaxed attitude to danger. The lenses turn completely black at the first hint of trouble, thus preventing the wearer from seeing anything that might alarm him/her. Appeared in and in chapters 5 and 6 of .
Thinking Cap.
A special helmet that Zaphod Beeblebrox uses in the film adaptation. It is possibly an old-fashioned device, as stated by Ford Prefect that it was used when ship captains needed to concentrate. It is basically a helmet with a trigger device on top that resembles an automatic citrus juicer, which is why it is powered by common lemon juice. The effects of the thinking cap, in Zaphod's case, last about 10 minutes per lemon. In the film, Arthur Dent negatively remarks to Ford's trust Zaphod's ability at making guesses by angrily replying "Go with the hunch of a man whose brain is fuelled by LEMONS!?" After Ford starts the Thinking Cap, Zaphod (who was very groggy from having his second head removed by force) immediately was able to walk straight and think smarter than usual, and ten minutes later he could still walk, but was back to his normal, over-the-top self.
Towels.
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" states that a towel is the most important item a hitchhiker can have. It also mentions that "to know where one's towel is" means to be in control of one's own life. It describes the towel as a multipurpose tool which can be converted into such things as a sail for a makeshift raft, a gas mask, a blindfold and a weapon for hand-to-hand combat. Resourceful hitchhikers have enhanced their towels in highly exotic ways, including embedding complex circuitry; Roosta, who Ford Prefect says "really knows where his towel is", fortified his towel with yellow stripes high in protein, green stripes with vitamin supplements, pink flowers of wheatgerm extract, and other areas containing barbecue sauce and anti-depressants. Ford Prefect, a traditionalist, has so far only reinforced his towel's seams, which enabled him to use it as a rope to stop himself from falling to his death. In the TV series, towels move of their own accord during hyperspatial jumps, and the amount they've moved allows an experienced hitchhiker to calculate the distance he has travelled. The towel was useful in the film version a handful of times, mainly by Ford. For example, while on the homeworld of the Vogons, he started to wave it around in front of a group of Vogons, who screamed and ran away. He also used it while attempting to cross the beach infested with shovel-like creatures which feed on thought. Another time, he used it to pull the pipe from the Vogon ship, attempting to increase the range of his ring.
The emphasis on towels is a reference to "Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe" by Ken Walsh, which inspired Adams' fictional guidebook and also stresses the importance of towels.
Other technology.
Breathe-o-Smart.
Breathe-o-Smart was the "sexier and smarter" "in-building climate-control" air-conditioning technology (in ) that sparked the Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots (of SrDt 3454). 
The horror erupted when three simultaneous events happened: Breathe-o-Smart Inc 
issued a statement "best results were achieved by using their systems in temperate climates", the breakdown of a Breathe-o-Smart system on a particularly hot and humid day putting hundreds of office staff into the street where a rampaging mob of long distance telephone operators who had got so twisted by the repetitiveness of their work that they had finally taken to the streets with megaphones - and rifles.
In days of riots, every single window was smashed, to cries of "Get off the line, asshole!" and a variety of animal noises.
So now, all (mechanical or electrical or quantum-mechanical or hydraulic or even wind, steam or piston-driven) devices are now legally required to carry this text:
Sub-Etha.
Sub-Etha is an interstellar faster-than-light telecommunications network used by hitchhikers to flag down passing spaceships. The primary hitcher's tool is known as the Electronic Thumb, a short black rod that can be used to contact passing ships and ask to be let on board. Ford also carries a Sens-O-Matic, a device for monitoring ships' Sub-Etha signals, and learns from it that the Vogons are on their way to demolish the Earth. Sub-Etha is used throughout the Milky Way for any kind of data transmission, such as listening to the news or updating the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" itself. The name is a reference to the ether, which was once believed to be a medium filling the universe.
Total Perspective Vortex.
The Total Perspective Vortex is allegedly the most horrible torture device to which a sentient being can be subjected.
Located on Frogstar World B, the machine was originally invented by one Trin Tragula in order to annoy his wife. Because she was forever nagging him for having no sense of proportion, he decided to invent something that would show her what having a sense of proportion really meant. Unfortunately the shock of being placed in the Vortex destroyed her brain, but Trin Tragula's grief was tempered by the knowledge that he had been right and she had been wrong. In Adams's words, the Total Perspective Vortex illustrated that "In an infinite universe, the one thing sentient life cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion." Gargravarr is the disembodied mind and custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex.
The machine produces a virtual reality model of the entire universe by means of the axiom that any piece of matter is affected by all other matter. The Vortex reconstructs the universe through computer processing of a high-resolution scan ("extrapolated matter analysis") of a piece of fairy cake. In the words of the "Hitchhiker's Guide",
Only Zaphod Beeblebrox is reported to have survived the Vortex unscathed (and then to have eaten the small piece of fairy cake). When it showed him the "You Are Here" marker, Zaphod correctly interpreted the Vortex as simply telling him that he was the most important being in the universe. This is due to the fact that he entered the Vortex in an artificial universe, which had been specially created for his benefit (thus making him the most important being in it) by Zarniwoop. After emerging from the artificial universe's Total Perspective Vortex, Zaphod ate the piece of fairy cake, saying "If I told you how much I needed this, I wouldn't have time to eat it."
In , the ideas behind the Total Perspective Vortex and the Guide Mark II are used to combine story lines from all of the radio episodes. This allows many of the plot lines from the divergent versions of the story to be wrapped up by the radio series' conclusion.
Wikkit gate.
The Wikkit Gate is an artifact featured in the novel "Life, the Universe and Everything".
The Wikkit Gate is a universal symbol among the diverse cultures of the Galaxy of the basic ideals of civilisation. The Galactic Government therefore chose to model the key that could unlock the envelope of Slo-Time surrounding planet Krikkit after a Wikkit Gate. The gate was destroyed, then the various parts re-animated as different objects around the universe. It is composed of:
According to the novel, the sport of cricket as played on Earth is a tasteless reminder of the Krikkit Wars, and the cricket wicket is a highly distorted racial memory of the Wikkit Gate. The novel describes the "bit where the little red ball hits the stumps" as being particularly offensive.

Philotheca verrucosa

Philotheca verrucosa, commonly known as Bendigo Waxflower or Fairy Waxflower, is a shrub in the family Rutaceae. The species is endemic to south-east Australia. It is usually up to 1.2 metres high, although heights up to 2 metres have been recorded in Gippsland. It produces white flowers from August to October in its native range. 
The species was first described in 1834 by French botanist Achille Richard who gave it the name "Erisotemon verrucosum", later amended to "Eriostemon verrucosus". It was transferred to the genus "Philotheca" by Paul G. Wilson in 1998.
"Philotheca" 'Flower Girl' is a hybrid cultivar, thought to be a cross between this species and "Philotheca myoporoides". It produces a profusion of light pink to white flowers during winter and spring and grows to between 1 and 2 metres high.

Larmer Tree Festival

The Larmer Tree Festival is a five-day music and arts festival held annually at the Larmer Tree Gardens near Tollard Royal on the Wiltshire-Dorset border in England. Described as "One of the most family-friendly festivals around", it is also noted for its "stunning location ... and outstanding eclectic line-up." In October 2008 the Larmer Tree Festival won the Family Festival Award at the UK Festival Awards.
Location.
The festival is held in the Larmer Tree Gardens, Victorian pleasure grounds founded by Augustus Pitt Rivers and described as having "an enchanted and tranquil atmosphere". The Larmer Tree itself was an ancient landmark tree on the ancient boundary between Wiltshire and Dorset. The tree was possibly an ancient Wych elm ("Ulmus glabra") under which King John (1167–1216) and his entourage were reputed to have met when they were out hunting. The festival takes place in a setting of lawns and carefully tended gardens, dotted with Indian pavilions and Roman temples, with free-roaming peacocks and macaws.
Organisation.
The inspiration for the festival came in 1990 when James Shepard came across the Larmer Tree Gardens while out jogging one day in Cranborne Chase. The first festival was held in 1990 and was a one-day event, featuring jazz and blues music, with about 200 attenders. The next festivals were two-day affairs, held over a weekend, with co-director Julia Safe joining the festival team in 1993. In 1995 the festival was extended to include the Friday night, and on-site camping was introduced.
The festival is now a five-day event licensed for 5,000 people. The organisers state that "numbers are still strictly limited to protect the intimate atmosphere cherished by devotees." Tickets for the event have sold out months in advance every year since 1995.
Shepard and Safe's company J & J Events Ltd. produces the festival. Shepard and Safe have rejected several major sponsorship deals as they are keen to protect their original concept. The ensuing independence and lack of sponsors' interference has allowed the small team of staff to develop the festival along its own unique lines.
A community spirit is encouraged at the festival: nearly 500 volunteers from the local area, covering 13 different roles, help out before, during and after the event, and it has links with many local organisations.
The festival organisers try to minimise its environmental impact, by such measures as recycling as much as possible and insisting on the use of biodegradable trays and wooden cutlery by the catering outlets at the event. They also encourage festival-goers to take green living measures such as lift-sharing, recycling and saving water on site.
Events.
"See Larmer Tree Festival line-ups for line-up listings."
In 2008 the festival featured 108 hours of entertainment, including 80 bands across seven stages over five days. The festival predominantly features acoustic folk, world music, reggae, roots and blues. Festival areas include the main stage, a two-pole big top, Acoustic Roots Café (ARC), The Club (a "retro-rave environment"), The Social (consisting of three large tipi tents), as well as the Garden Stage, the original wooden Victorian Singing Theatre building.
There is also an extensive range of creative workshops for both adults, teenagers and younger children. There are designated teenagers' and children's areas which offer activities and workshops "in everything from baby yoga to unicycling".
Recent developments at the festival include the Club Larmer theatre productions and talks. Recently, film critic and writer Mark Kermode interviewed leading figures in the world of film, including Ken Russell in 2007 and Nicolas Roeg in 2008.
Over the years, many different holistic therapies and treatments have been offered in the Secret Garden area, including osteopathy, Swedish massage, Thai massage, Bach flower remedies, Indian head massage, reflexology and shiatsu.
In addition to all the festival areas, there are of gardens for festival-goers to explore.
The 2011 Larmer Tree Festival is scheduled to take place from 13–17 July.
Facilities.
Catering facilities on site provide food and drinks from around the world, served from breakfast through to late night snacks. The site also has three bars.
The campsite next to the festival ground is free, with free hot showers. In 2006 the festival toilets won the "UK Festival Awards 2006 Portaloo Sunset Award For Best Toilets".
Awards.
In 2008 the Larmer Tree Festival was nominated for five awards by UK Festival Awards: Best Small Festival (for festivals of 10,000 festival-goers or less); Best Lineup; Grass Roots Festival Award (for "the king of anti-commercialism"); Family Festival Award and Best Toilets. The festival made the shortlist in three categories: Best Small Festival, Family Festival Award and Best Toilets, and won the Family Festival Award when the results were announced at the awards ceremony in London on 30 October 2008.

The Shamrock (band)

The Shamrock is a six-piece Croatian band from Rijeka that plays a mixture of Slavic and Celtic music, formed in 2007. The first album, titled "..otom potom..", was released in June 2008, and was a mixture of traditional Irish music and self-written songs. In summer 2009. they released an EP with three songs titled "Sjećanje na livade" (The memory of the meadow). Over time, they're creating more and more their own special style with a strong influence of ancient Slavic folklore and mythology as well as Celtic music.
A new album will be released in 2013. This second album will put more power with melodic folk instruments, hard guitar riffs and very loud and fast drum beats.
Biography.
The actual idea to create The Shamrock came during the performance on the 29. RiRock Festival, while the former band "Shamrock" ( the Punk band whose members were Damir, Aleksandar and Paul) called a mutual friend Hrvoje to learn to play one of their songs on the block flute. 
After the outstanding reaction from the public everything started to change in a very fast motion. The band decided to switch their style into Folk. The members started to buy new instruments ( Banjo, Whistle, Mandolin), new members started to come to the "new" band. In a very short period the band got 4 new members. Ana and Petra as the backvocals, Elvis as the Bass player and Anamarija on the violin. In that formation the first demo album "...otom potom... " was recorded and it contained 5 songs. 
Shortly after that as a new member came Antonio who played the Accordion and Petra left the band. In this formation the band recorded its first Demo-single "Sjećanje na livade" with 3 songs. 
Band had more than a few concerts on the areas of Kvarner and the entire Croatia, and also played on lot of festivals and in a very short time it found its place on the scene. 
At the end of 2009. Antonio left the band and the number of members came to a size 7. The band made their first Music-video for the song “Novi Dom”. Aleksandar left the band after the filming– Filip took his place. A short period after that Elvis and Ana left the band too, then Sandi joined The Shamrock. Hrvoje and Filip left the band in 2011 and 2012 because of their Jobs, so Igor and Mario came on their places.

No. 243 Squadron RAF

No 243 Squadron was formed in August 1918 from Nos 414 and 415 Flights of the seaplane station at Cherbourg which had been functioning as an out-station of Calshot while part of the Royal Naval Air Service.
History.
World War I.
Its seaplanes carried out anti-submarine patrols off the French coast and around the Channel Islands until the end of the war and it disbanded on 15 March 1919.
World War II.
On 12 March 1941, No.243 reformed at Kallang as a fighter squadron for the defence of Singapore. The shortcomings of its Buffaloes were soon apparent and when Japanese fighters came within range, the squadron suffered heavy loses and by the end of January 1942 was operating its surviving aircraft as part of a mixed force, the other Buffalo squadrons being in a similar state. Its identity was gradually lost to the evacuation of redundant personnel and by the time all fighters were withdrawn from the Singapore airfields, it no longer existed as a unit, having been disbanded on 20 January 1942.
On 1 June 1942, No.243 reformed at Outston, taking over No.242 Squadron's Spitfires and became operational on the 12th. After defensive duties, it turned its aircraft over to No.232 Squadron at the end of September and in November sailed for North Africa, where it became operational again with Spitfires in Algeria in January 1943. For the rest of the Tunisian campaign, it flew sweeps and provided escorts for day bombers attacking enemy bases and transport and in June moved to Malta for similar missions over Sicily. A few days after the Allied landings there, No.243 moved into the beachhead, repeating this in September after the Salerno landings. In December 1943, it moved to the Levant and after fully converting to Spitfire IXs left for Corsica in April 1944. Escort missions and ground attack sweeps were flown over northern Italy and southern France and cover provivded for the Allied landings on the French Riviera in August before the squadron was again disbanded on 31 October 1944.
No.243 reformed on 15 December 1944 at Morecambe, two days before embarking for Canada where it began training with Dakotas. In January 1945, these began moving across the Pacific to Australia, where communications flights began between British bases in the South West Pacific area, mainly to British Pacific Fleet bases. By the end of the war the squadron was flying scheduled services and extended these to Hong Kong on its surrender. A large proportion of the squadron personnel was Australian and they were demobilised locally when No.243 disbanded on 15 April 1946.

The Lamb of God and the Beast from the Abyss

The Lamb of God and the Beast from the Abyss () is a 1996 book of collected papers from the second theological-philosophical symposium held during the Days of Saints Cyril and Methodius, containing contributions of twenty scholars and clerics, particularly from Montenegro, including Dr Radovan Karadžić. It "seeks primarily to justify the war in Bosnia and provide for a general ‘philosophical’ opposition to the anti-war literature published
in Yugoslavia". It was edited by Rados M. Mladenovic & Hierodeacon Jovan and published by Svetigora, the publishing house of the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral.
Background.
The second theological-philosophical symposium of the Serbian Orthodox Church was organized in 1996 by Amfilohije Radović Metropolitan of the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral and Archbishop of Cetinje shortly after end of the wars in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the publisher, "the writers of this book are sure that tragic defeat during these two wars is in reality a great victory which can have cosmic proportions".
Writers.
The book is a collection of 15 essays by, among others: 
Content.
The first section, titled 'And Holy and War' has two essays. In the first, Amfilohije Radović writes about how it is possible that Holy Peter who "was rightfully compared with Moses and Joshua" fought in three wars during his rule. The second part of the first section discusses the work of Velja Stanišić who created a poster for the "Bicentennial Anniversary of the Victory won by St Peter of Cetinje".
The first part of the second section, "War as experience" was written by Radovan Karadžić. In it, he asks "Was this a true War". In his essay, Karadžić argues that the Bosnian Serbs have been a hundred times victims whose enemies have killed all that is Serbian. Milovan Milutinović writes in his essay about war without a united program of Serbs west and east of the river Drina. In his words, the creation of Republika Srpska and Krajina by Serbian patriotic forces west of the Drina was necessary due to the extremist moves by Slovenian and Croatian secessionists; the Muslim-Croat coalition which wanted to become masters of the Serbs; strong anti-Serbian propaganda in the global media and others. He is satisfied with the organization of Serbian defensive forces west of the Drina, but not in the east. Milutinović ends his essay with the 1996 words of ICTY indictee Ratko Mladić: "We have been without a united Serbian national program, aim or strategy". Subsequently, Tihomir Burzanović discusses Ustaše crimes in 1942 and modern crimes against the Serbs of Bosnia. Regarding events during the Yugoslav Wars, he writes about the alleged crimes of Naser Orić, commander of Bosnian Muslim forces in Srebrenica from 1992, while the city was under siege from Bosnian Serb forces, whose ICTY conviction was overturned on appeal and similar crimes of Croatian and Bosniak forces. In his essay, the writer does not speak about Croats or Bosniaks, but about Ustaše and Muslims. The final essay of this section, by Mladen Šukalo, is about the alleged 'double standards' used by the international media.
The third section is called War as a lie and discusses the "lies and deception the protectors of the secessionist republics which have succeeded in isolating the Serbian people from the rest of the world". The first essay, written by Serbian Orthodox priest Atanasije Jevtić is speaking about is speaking how Serbs have fought always only defensive wars and that Croatian Dalmacija and Dubrovnik are in reality Bosnia and Herzegovina coasts and after that he is attacking dictator and traitor Slobodan Milošević which has given Krajina to Croatia and parts of Republika Srpska to Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Last of his comments is about Western powers which have destroyed Yugoslavia in similar way like UK which has earlier destroyed Cyprus. In second essay of this section Mirko Zurovac of Belgrade university is speaking how western powers have destroyed Yugoslavia and then together with UNPROFOR helped Croatian and Muslim (Bosniaks) military forces. Author of this text is writing short history of events so that reader can better understand that Serbs are victims of genocidal war supported by NATO. 3rd essay is speaking about Microsoft Encarta 1996 which is in writer words biased against Serbs. Last essay in this section is speaking why this war is worst of all wars. In writer thinking this is not because number of victims, but because of number of lies which are created in world lies factory (Hollywood) to be used against Orthodox world. Roots of this hate in author words it is possible to find in the Rolling Stones song "Sympathy for the Devil"
4th section called Ethics, right and war is speaking about courts for war crimes. In first essay Dr. Jovan Babić from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy is speaking about moral legality of courts (ICTY ?) which will give penalty for defenders of status quo ante (Serbs) and rewards for secessionists (Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia) and for other examples he is using US war crimes in Vietnam and soldiers like James Duffy which will never see court for war crimes. Second essay is speaking about morale which is betrayed, abandoned during war. In last essay of this section Mr. Petar Bojanić is using like example correspondence between Norberto Bobbio and Carl Schmitt for statement that price for defeat is never small.
5th section called Soul and War it is written by Bosko V. Popovic and Dr. Jovan Mirić from Philosophical faculty in Belgrade. First essay called Psychological interpretation of War is speaking about psychology of war and human nature. In essay Popovic is speaking about James's study "Moral Equivalents of War", Pitirim Sorokin, Zontanon Colon and other scholars. On other side Mirić in his essay called The Wars in the Kingdom oon Earth psychological interpretation of the answer given to the question of causes of war and for that he is using old Serbian folkloric poetry
6th section called People and War is having 3 essays. First called Serbs and War is speaking about stereotype that Serbs are war loving nation and how they have been trapped by Yugoslav idea in 1918 and 1945, but they have refused te be trapped in 1991. Second called Nationalism and War three types of concept concerning the determination of the national: the Romanic, Germanic and Slavic. Last essay in this section called Eastern Ortodoxy and War is speaking present historical and spiritual-political situation of Orthodoxy. Matej Arsenijevic is saying that it is not accident that first intervention of NATO has been against Ortodox Serbs.

Scarab (artifact)

Scarabs were popular amulets in ancient Egypt. They survive in large numbers and, through their inscriptions and typology, they are an important source of information for archeologists and historians of the Ancient world. They also represent a significant body of ancient art.
For reasons that are not clear (although no doubt connected to the religious significance of the Egyptian god Khepri), amulets in the form of scarab beetles had became enormously popular in Ancient Egypt by the early Middle Kingdom (approx 2000BCE) and remained popular for the rest of the pharaonic period and beyond. During that long period the function of scarabs repeatedly changed. Primarily amulets, they were also inscribed for use as personal or administrative seals or were incorporated into jewellery. Some scarabs were apparently created for political or diplomatic purposes to commemorate or advertise royal achievements. By the early New Kingdom "heart scarabs" had become part of the battery of amulets protecting mummies.
From the middle Bronze Age, other ancient peoples of the Mediterranean and the Middle East imported scarabs from Egypt and also produced scarabs in Egyptian or local styles, especially in the Levant.
Description.
Scarabs were produced in vast numbers for many centuries and many thousands have survived. They were generally intended to be worn or carried by the living. They were typically carved or moulded in the form of a scarab beetle (usually identified as Scarabaeus sacer) with varying degrees of naturalism but usually at least indicating the head, wing case and legs but with a flat base. The base was usually inscribed with designs and/or hieroglyphs to form an impression seal. Scarabs were usually drilled from end to end to allow them to be strung on a thread or incorporated into a swivel ring. The most common range of sizes for scarabs is from 6mm to 4 cm (length) and most are probably between 1 cm and 2 cm long. Larger scarabs were made from time to time for particular purposes (such as the commemorative scarabs of Amenhotep III). "Heart scarabs" (typically 5 cm to 9 cm long, made of dark hardstone and not pierced for suspension) were made for a specific funerary purpose and should be considered separately.
Scarabs were generally either carved from stone or moulded from Egyptian faience. Once carved, they would typically be glazed blue or green and then fired. The most common stone used for scarabs was a form of steatite, a soft stone which becomes hard when fired (forming enstatite). Hardstone scarabs were also made and the stones most commonly used were green jasper, amethyst and carnelian. 
While the majority of scarabs would originally have been green or blue the coloured glazes used have often either become discoloured or have been lost, leaving most steatite scarabs appearing white or brown.
Religious significance of the scarab beetle.
In ancient Egyptian religion, the Sun god Ra is seen to roll across the sky each day, transforming bodies and souls. Beetles of the Scarabaeidae family ("dung beetle") roll dung into a ball as food and as a brood chamber in which to lay eggs that are later transformed into larva. For these reasons the scarab was seen as a symbol of this heavenly cycle and of the idea or rebirth or regeneration. The Egyptian god Khepri, Ra as the rising sun, was often depicted as a scarab beetle or as a scarab beetle-headed man. The ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. A golden scarab, of the monotheistic Nefertiti was discovered in the Uluburun wreck. 
Historical development.
By the end of the First Intermediate Period (about 2055 BCE) scarabs had become extremely common. They largely replaced cylinder seals and circular "button seals" with simple geometric designs. Throughout the period in which they were made, Scarabs were often engraved with the names of pharaohs and other royal persons. In the Middle Kingdom scarabs were also engraved with the names and titles of officials and used as official seals. From the New Kingdom scarabs bearing the names and titles of officials became rarer, while scarabs bearing the names of gods, often combined with short prayers or mottos ("With Ra behind there is nothing to fear") became more popular. These "wish" scarabs are often difficult to translate.
Commemorative Scarabs.
Amenhotep III (immediate predecessor of Akhnaten) is famous for having commemorative scarabs made. These were large (mostly between 3.5cm and 10cm long) and made of steatite. They are beautifully crafted scarabs, apparently created under royal supervision or control and carry lengthy inscriptions describing one of five important events in his reign (and all of which mention his queen, Tiye). More than 200 examples have survived and they have been found in locations that suggest they were sent out as royal gifts/propaganda in support of Egyptian diplomatic activities. These large scarabs continued and developed an earlier Eighteenth Dynasty tradition of making scarabs celebrating specific royal achievements, such as the erection of obelisks at major temples during the reign of Thuthmosis III. The tradition was revived centuries later during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, when the Kushite pharaoh Shabaka (721-707 BCE) had large scarabs made commemorating his victories in imitation of those produced for Amenhotep III.
Funerary Scarabs.
Although scarab amulets were sometimes placed in tombs as part of the deceased's personal effects or as jewellery, generally they have no particular association with ancient Egyptian funerary rites. There are, however, three types of specifically funerary scarabs, "heart scarabs", "pectoral scarabs" and "naturalistic" scarabs. 
Heart scarabs became popular in the early New Kingdom and remained in use until the Third Intermediate Period. They are large scarabs (typically 4cm-12cm long) often made from dark green or black stone and are not pierced for suspension. The base of a heart scarab was usually carved, either directly or on a gold plate fixed to the base, with hieroglyphs which name the deceased and repeat some or all of spell 30B from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. The spell commands the deceased's heart (typically left in the mummy's chest cavity, unlike the other viscera) not to give evidence against the deceased, when the deceased is being judged by the gods of the underworld. It is often suggested that the heart is being commanded not to give false evidence but the opposite may be true. The Book of the Dead requires the heart scarab to be made of green "nemehef" stone but a variety of green or dark coloured stones were used. Heart scarabs were often hung around the mummy's neck with a gold wire and the scarab itself was held in a gold frame. 
From the Twenty-fifth Dynasty onwards large(typically 3cm-8cm long)relatively flat uninscribed "pectoral scarabs" were sewn, via holes formed at the edge of the scarab, onto the chests of mummies, together with a pair of separately made outstretched wings. These were mainly made from faience and glazed blue. The association of pectoral scarabs appears to be with the god Khepri, who is often depicted in the same form.
A third kind of funerary scarab is the "naturalistic" scarab. These were relatively small scarabs (typically 2cm to 3cm long) made from a wide variety of hardstones and faience and are distinguished from other scarabs by having naturalistic carved "3D" bases, which often also include an integral suspension loop running widthways. Groups of these funerary scarabs, often made from different materials, formed part of the battery of amulets which protected mummies in the Late Period..
Scarabs with Royal Names.
Scarabs are often found inscribed with the names of pharaohs and more rarely with the names of their queens and other members of the royal family. Generally, the better established and longer reigning a king was, the more scarabs are found bearing one or more of his names. 
Most scarabs bearing a royal name can reasonably be dated to the period in which the person named lived. However, there are a number of important exceptions. 
Scarabs are found bearing the names of pharaohs of the Old Kingdom (particularly of well-known kings such as Khufu, Khafra and Unas). It is now believed these were produced in later periods, most probably during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty or Twenty-sixth Dynasty, when there was considerable interest in and imitation of the works of great kings of the past. 
Scarabs are also found in vast numbers which appear to bear the throne name of the New Kingdom king Thuthmosis III (1504-1450 BCE) "Men Kheper Re" ("the appearance of Ra is established"). Many of these scarabs do date from the long and successful reign of this great warrior pharaoh, or shortly thereafter but many, perhaps the majority, probably do not. Like all pharaohs, Thuthmosis was regarded as a god after his death. Unlike most pharaohs his cult, centered on his mortuary temple, seems to have continued for years, if not centuries. As a result, many scarabs bearing the inscription "Men Kheper Re" are likely to commemorate Thuthmosis III but may have been produced hundreds of years later. Later pharaohs adopted the same throne name (including Piye of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, 747-716 BCE) and this can lead to confusion. The hieroglyphs making "Men Kheper Re" seem to have become regarded as a protective charm in themselves and were inscribed on scarabs without any specific reference to Thuthmosis III. It can be doubted that in many cases the carver understood the meaning of the inscription but reproduced it blindly. On a lesser scale the same may be true of the throne name of Rameses II (1279-1212 BCE) "User Maat Re" ("the justice of Ra is powerful"), which is commonly found on scarabs which otherwise do not appear to date from his reign. 
The birth names of pharaohs were also popular names among private individuals and so, for example, a scarab simply bearing the name "Amenhotep" need not be associated with any particular king who also bore that name.
The significance of a scarab bearing a royal name is unclear and probably changed over time and from scarab to scarab. Many may simply have been made privately in honour of a ruler during or after his lifetime. Some may also have been royal gifts. In some cases scarabs with royal names may have been official seals or badges of office, perhaps connected with the royal estates or household, others, although relatively few, may have been personal seals owned by the royal individual named on them. As the king fulfilled many different roles in ancient Egyptian society, so scarabs naming a pharaoh may have had a direct or indirect connection with a wide range of private and public activities.

Glass delusion

The glass delusion was an external manifestation of a psychiatric disorder recorded in Europe in the late Middle Ages (15th to 17th centuries). People feared that they were made of glass “and therefore likely to shatter into pieces”. One famous early sufferer was King Charles VI of France who refused to allow people to touch him, and wore reinforced clothing to protect himself from accidental “shattering”.
The delusion.
Concentration of the glass delusion among the wealthy and educated classes allowed modern scholars to associate it with a wider and better described disorder of scholar's melancholy.
Contemporary accounts.
Robert Burton’s "The Anatomy of Melancholy" (1621) touches on the subject in the commentary as one of many related manifestations of the same anxiety: “Fear of devils, death, that they shall be so sick, of some such or such disease, ready to tremble at every object, they shall die themselves forthwith, or that some of their dear friends or near allies are certainly dead; imminent danger, loss, disgrace still torment others, &c.; "that they are all glass, and therefore will suffer no man to come near them;" that they are all cork, as light as feathers; others as heavy as lead; some are afraid their heads will fall off their shoulders, that they have frogs in their bellies, Etc.”
Miguel de Cervantes based a short story, "The Glass Graduate" (, 1613) on the delusion of the title subject, an aspiring young lawyer. Thomas Rodaja fell into a grave depression after being bed-ridden for six months after being poisoned with a purportedly aphrodisiac potion. After two years of illness, Rodaja was cured by a monk; no details of the cure are provided except that the monk was allegedly a miracle-maker.
Dutch poet Constantijn Huygens wrote a "Costly Folly" (1622) centered on a subject who “fears everything that moves in his vicinity... the chair will be the death for him, he trembles at the bed, fearful that one will break his bum, the other smash his head".
French philosopher René Descartes wrote "Meditations on First Philosophy" (1641), using the glass delusion as an example of an insane person whose perceived knowledge of the world differs from the majority.
In modern times, the glass delusion has disappeared. “Surveys of modern psychiatric institutions have only revealed two specific (uncorroborated) cases of the glass delusion. Foulché-Delbosc reports finding one Glass Man in a Paris asylum, and a woman who thought she was a potsherd was recorded at an asylum in Merenberg.”
In popular culture.
The Glass Delusion, an alternative rock duo from Hull, England, take their name from the psychiatric disorder.

Watering trough

A watering trough (or artificial watering point) is a receptacle intended to provide drinking water to animals. They are typically intended for livestock on farms or ranches, but may also be used by wild animals, either intentionally or consequentially.
In Australia, the watering trough is established so that sheep, cattle and other farmed animals can drink, but the troughs may also attract wild animals such as kangaroos. To reduce this, some water troughs are designed to exclude these animals or reduce their use of the trough.
Watering troughs were very common in many towns and cities as a means for horses to drink while they were tethered to a post. In 1927 animal lovers, Annis and George Bills, funded the building of up to 500 watering troughs in Australia, Ireland, England and the United States. Many can still be seen today inscribed with "Donated by Annis and George Bills Australia".

Because of the absence of better maps, the one of Lanuza is included to show the position in the province. The area of CarCanMadCarLan includes the one of Lanuza and the yellow marked 4 municipalities in the north-west. That is all the territory south-west of the Carrascal bay and the Lanuza bay.
Itik-itik dance which originated from the province of Surigao del sur specifically in CarCanMadCarLan area. Itik-itik is a dance which imitate duck movements among rice paddies and swamplands.
History.
From the later half of the 16th century to 1919, the land area of the town of Cantilan was roughly 130,000 hectares which is approximately one fourth of the present area of the province of Surigao del Sur. This was the whole of Cantilan, which is now known, with the acronym of CARCANMADCARLAN, which is derived from the first three-letter syllables of the towns of Carrascal, Cantilan, Madrid, Carmen and Lanuza.
The original acronym of the whole area was CARCANLAN, which comprised Carrascal, Cantilan and Lanuza. On December 10, 1918, Executive Order No. 52 of American Governor General Francis Burton Harrison that was signed by Charles Yeater, divided Cantilan into three parts. On February 2, 1953, it became CARCANMADLAN when Madrid was created as a municipality and detached from the mother town by virtue of Executive Order by President Elpidio Quirino. When barangay Carmen of Lanuza was created as a town by Republic Act No. 6367, on August 16, 1971, the indigenous naming of the whole area that was once Cantilan finally became CARCANMADCARLAN.
Topography.
Known in the past for its vast timberlands and, for the present, with its over six thousand hectares of government-irrigated lands, it has seawaters in the east, mountains in the west, north and south. The plains have navigable rivers known as Carac-an, Union, Cantilan, Consuelo, Benoni, Bun-ot, Adlayan, Lancogue and some smaller ones. The extent of creeks and wetlands or lowlands and swamps were main landmarks and features of its old topography. The conversions and developments of the lowlands into rice paddies began in 18th century when the friars were stationed therein. Those rivers and creeks that were developed fishponds did not begin earlier than the first of the 20th century.
This narrative history and other information was taken from the benevolent book of Mr. Eulogio Eleazar published 1980 entitled "History of Cantilan". 
Climate.
Carcanmadcarlan, like the whole island of Mindanao is considered having a tropical climate, with an average monthly precipitation of 257,2 mm (10,13 inches). However, its wettest season fall between the months of November until March. Dry season start between April to September with brief afternoon showers and thunderstorms locally called sobasco. 
Transportation.
The Area is passed by the Surigao-Tandag coastal road. Even if the road (and the bridges) are meanwhile mostly upgraded to concrete, there is still a piece of about 12.5 km in the northern part that is not fortified. Especially during and after rain many cars are trapped in the mud (see photo). But there are also harbours in Cantilan ad Lanuza. Even if the river-harbour of Cantilan (in the Cantilan river) is only usable by Pump boats, the "Consuela Port" can be reached also by bigger Ships. The next Airports are Surigao Airport (IATA: SUG, ICAO: RPMS) and Butuan Airport (IATA: BXU, ICAO: RPME). The Tandag Airfield (IATA: TDG, ICAO: RPMW) is not longer in use.

MV Fedra

M/V "Fedra" was a Liberian-registered bulk-carrier cargo ship. It ran aground and smashed against Europa Point, the southernmost tip of Gibraltar on 10 October 2008 following severe gale force winds measuring 12 on the Beaufort scale. Spanish and Gibraltarian emergency services mounted a joint rescue operation, Gibraltar declared a Major Incident and requested the standby of additional statutory and voluntary emergency services (including St John Ambulance Gibraltar), although due to the safe rescue of all crew from the Fedra they were ultimately not needed. 
Five of its 31 crew members were airlifted to safety by a Spanish coast guard helicopter and the rest were hoisted up by an improvised crane system. The vessel broke in half shortly thereafter.
About half of its 300 tons of fuel spilled into the sea. Some of such oil washed ashore along Gibraltar's western coast, particularly in the area of Rosia Bay and Camp Bay. Spanish sources said that some fuel from the Fedra had washed up on some Campo beaches having drifted as far as Tarifa. There were also oil slicks in the Bay of Gibraltar.
The Fedra avoided becoming a permanent shipwreck when the forward section was re-floated and towed round into the Bay of Gibraltar in February 2009. It was moored alongside the South Mole in Gibraltar Harbour. The superstructure was cut away from the hull of the aft section, and was placed the dockside at HM Naval Base.
A report was released by the Gibraltar Maritime Association in January 2012 which reveals how the Company undermined the Master of the Fedra and his authority in his attempts to save both the crew and the ship. The report also explains the various aspects which led to the demise of the MV Fedra.

0114

0114 is the national dialling code for Sheffield in the United Kingdom. The area it serves includes almost all of the City of Sheffield and some adjacent areas. When STD codes were first introduced, Sheffield was assigned 0742. The current 0114 code became active as part of PhONEday on 16 April 1995. All subscriber numbers within the area code consist of seven digits. The code is used at several telephone exchanges as part a linked numbering scheme. In common with all other British area codes the initial '0' is a trunk prefix that is not required when dialling Sheffield from abroad.
History.
Before 1965, Sheffield had 5-digit telephone numbers, with the first digit indicating the exchange area of the telephone line. Sheffield's 6-digit numbers were implemented by prefixing the original 5-digit numbers with a duplicate of the first digit (seen below), other than the 2xxxx numbers which were prefixed by 7 (as seen by the last example). This grouped telephone numbers centrally in the 1 to 9 range with a larger "buffer" at the extremes.
Switching to 6-digit numbers produced 90,000 available numbers for each exchange group, providing another 450,000 available numbers after combining both phases, producing a potential 500,000 numbers in Sheffield.
Between regions.
Until the 1980s, Stocksbridge, Oughtibridge, and some other areas had 4-digit numbers. Within Stocksbridge and Oughtibridge people dialed only 4-digit numbers, while from Sheffield people dialed prefix 88 for Stocksbridge and prefix 86 for Oughtibridge. From Oughtibridge, people dialed 88xxxx for Stocksbridge and 9xxxxxx for Sheffield. This led to some confusion, leading people to often dial wrong numbers. During the 1980s these local areas were unified into 6-digit Sheffield numbers so that from anywhere in the Sheffield code area, 88xxxx dialed a Stocksbridge number, even from within Stocksbridge. Once the 8-prefix was merged into the full local number this released 8xxxxx numbers.
Transition to 7-digit system.
Transitioning to 7-digit numbers in 1995 involved prefixing each 6-digit number with a 2. Immediately after the 1995 change, the corresponding 22x-xxxx numbers became available for allocation, followed by the 20x-xxxx and 21x-xxxx ranges, since the corresponding 0742 0xxxxx and 1xxxxx wouldn't have been issued as local numbers weren't permitted to start with a 1 or a 0. The 0114 code allows for a potential maximum of 7,990,000 local numbers to be issued, assuming the use of the entire valid range from (0114) 200-0000 to (0114) 998-9999 country-wide.
Coverage.
The 0114 dialing code includes the whole of Sheffield except for Midhopestones area which uses the Barnsley 01226 dialling code and the Fox House area which uses dialing code 01433. The codes extends beyond the City of Sheffield to include the Killamarsh area of North East Derbyshire and the Aston, Aughton, and Ulley areas of Rotherham.
Number allocation.
Under the National Telephone Numbering Plan the code operates with the following sub-ranges:
Sheffield codice_1 numbers have now been exhausted, so new numbers issued now begin with 3 or 4, rather than the old ones being reused. There have reportedly been many problems involving people incorrectly dialing codice_2 for codice_3 numbers and therefore being connected to the wrong person or business.
The area code is not subject to number conservation and the regulator Ofcom does not restrict the size of number blocks that are allocated.

Tangled (album)

Tangled is the third studio album by Jane Wiedlin, released in 1990 on EMI Records. It was also her third solo album after leaving New Wave group The Go-Go's.
Background.
After the American Top 10 success of the 1988 single "Rush Hour" from the album "Fur", "Tangled" took two years to complete and upon release failed to gain any commercial success and sold poorly, which in turn eventually led to Wiedlin's departure from EMI Records. Wiedlin would later state that this was largely due to EMI who failed to promote it. The album was supported by a Summer tour in America, with plans for the tour being announced as early as May 1990.
A total of two singles were released from the album. The leading and main single "World on Fire," was released with a semi-controversial music video. The single was issued in America, Japan and Italy. The second single was the promotional-only American single "Guardian Angel", which aimed solely at radio airplay. It was issued as a one-track promo picture CD with custom back insert and remains scarce today.
"Tangled" was produced entirely by Peter Collins, except for the track "99 Ways" which was produced by Collins and Andy Hill. Hill had co-wrote the song with Wiedlin and Chris Thompson.
The title track "Tangled" would appear in the 1990 romantic comedy film "Pretty Woman". It would be included on the film's soundtrack album release in January 1990.
Despite the album's limited success, EMI would release the 1993 compilation "The Very Best of Jane Wiedlin" which would include "Tangled", "Flowers on the Battlefield", "Paper Heart", "Guardian Angel", "Big Rock Candy Mountain", "99 Ways" and "World on Fire".
In the August 1990 issue of the Orange Coast Magazine, an article based on Wiedlin under the title "Jane Wiedlin Untangles Her Past" was written by author Keith Tuber. The article wrote ""The diminutive singer/songwriter and former Go-Go's band member is seated in the cluttered conference room of her record company's Hollywood offices. She's excited about "Tangled", her second solo album for EMI and third overall. She has every right to be excited. "Tangled" is easily her best individual project to date. The title track appears in the blockbuster film "Pretty Woman", and Wiedlin has just completed the video for her current single, "World on Fire"."
The song "Paper Hearts" was written by Wiedlin, Cyndi Lauper and Richard Orange. In the Orange Coast Magazine article, Tuber stated ""The best track, however, is "Paper Hearts," a tune she inadvertently co-wrote with Cyndi Lauper. Inadvertent because she's yet to meet the pop artist whose vocal style is not unlike her own."" The article quoted Wiedlin, who stated ""It was sort of a song written by mail, more or less. I'd gotten a demo of the song in the mail and felt that it was real strong. She'd written it with another writer, but I wasn't that happy with the lyrics. I usually don't feel very comfortable singing other people's lyrics anyway. It's difficult to bring the right emotion into it. So, I asked them how they'd feel about me rewriting the lyrics, and they said, 'Go ahead and try, and we'll let you know what we think.' So I did, and they seemed to think the lyrics were OK. I recorded it, and I think the song came out great. You can't tell that it wasn't written at the same time."" Tuber continued ""Wiedlin, sniffling from the effects of a cold, pauses to sneeze. She might just as well be sniffling from her memory of the incident that served as her inspiration for the lyrics to "Paper Hearts." She wrote the words when she learned from a mutual friend that her former best friend, with whome she lost contact years before, had become a heroin addict. The news touched her emotionally, and she's yet to decided whether to tell him he's the subject of the song.""
Later in a September 12, 1996 article in the Los Angeles Times, writer Jon Matsumoto, under the title "Playing rough", the writer stated ""Since the Go-Go's broke up in 1984, Wiedlin, who plays Friday at the Coach House, has released three solo albums. "Fur," in 1988, yielded a top-10 single in the infectious pop ditty "Rush Hour." But her last album, 1990's "Tangled," left her bitter about the record industry. It took two years to finish, and even after shooting what she termed an "extravagant" music video, EMI Records, Wiedlin said, never put its promotional muscle behind the album. It subsequently suffered a quick commercial death."" Wiedlin was quoted, ""It left such a bad taste in my mouth. It was, 'I can't handle this anymore.' I know label support happens to people all the time and there's nothing you can really do about it. Luckily, I had the luxury where I didn't really have to do anything. Then after a couple of years of floating around, I started thinking about doing music again and started writing songs.""
Release.
The album was released in America, Canada and Japan only via EMI USA. It was issued on vinyl, cassette and CD.
The American cassette release was a XDR (Expanded Dynamic Range) Cassette. In Canada, the album was pressed by Disque Americ and was distributed by Capitol Records/EMI Of Canada Limited. In Japan, it was released in 1991 as a 10-track CD, which included a lyric booklet picture sleeve plus an obi-strip.
Today the album remains long since out-of-print and has never re-issued or released as a digital MP3 download on places like Amazon or iTunes.
Critical reception.
Alex Henderson of Allmusic stated ""When Jane Wiedlin followed Belinda Carlisle's lead and pursued a solo career, the former Go-Go encountered more than her share of skepticism, even among Go-Gos fans. The skepticism proved to be well-founded when Tangled hit the streets. Although a decent musician, Wiedlin doesn't have much of a voice - and her inadequacy as a singer is made all the more obvious by the pedestrian nature of the songs. None of this sugary, girlish pop-rock begins to compare with the Go-Gos' triumphs - or even Carlisle's solo projects. There's nothing wrong with sugary, girlish pop-rock if it's well done, but Tangled most certainly isn't. Between Wiedlin's weak singing and the consistently poor material, Tangled is a disc to avoid."" Henderson had also selected "At the End of the Day", "Guardian Angel" and "World on Fire" as highlights by labeling them as AMG Pick Tracks.
In the August 1990 issue of the Orange Coast Magazine, an article based on Wiedlin under the title "Jane Wiedlin Untangles Her Past" was written by author Keith Tuber. The author wrote ""Wiedlin is excited about "Tangled", her second solo album for EMI and third overall. She has every right to be excited. "Tangled" is easily her best individual project to date. The best track is "Paper Hearts," a tune she co-wrote with Cyndi Lauper.""
Caitlin O'Connor Creevy of the Chicago Tribune reviewed the album on July 26, 1990, where she stated ""Former Go-Go Jane Wiedlin has certainly not taken a permanent vacation from the signature sound of her band of old, but she is able to develop a distinct tone and add an almost ethereal uniqueness to that familiar Go-Go's beat. Wiedlin's solo sound is more mature and considerably less bubble-gummy, bop-'til-you-droppy than that of the now-defunct girls band that brought us such classics as "We Got the Beat" and "Head Over Heels." The title track is a marvy little sing-along to the radio hit, as well as being one of the best tunes on the album. "Paper Heart," co-written by Cyndi Lauper, is a slower song about a friend with a drug problem; this one captures Lauper's way with ballads, and Wiedlin's voice-smoother, less irritating than Cyndi's is the perfect translator.""
On September 9, 1990, Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times reviewed the album, stating ""You wouldn't think the comely, unclad figure on the cover needs a diet, but Wiedlin has to get off the sugar. Half of "Tangled" is slick and over-sweet. The former Go-Go does much better when setting her fragile, Cyndi Lauper sound-alike voice in more intimate ballad surroundings. Wiedlin also excels in two anthems that engage broad themes of war and freedom with emotional acuity. Why not make every song matter?""
Associated press writer David Dishneau reviewed the album for the Daily News on September 9, 1990, and for The Albany Herald on September 13, 1990, under the title "Wiedlin 'Tangled' in hit LP". The same review was posted in the Rocky Mountain News of October 5, 1990 under the title "Tangled unties Jane Wiedlin's talents". The review stated ""Jane Wiedlin was largely responsible for everything that was good about the Go-Gos. On Tangled, her second solo project, she builds on that reputation. The 10 selections, nine of them co-written by Wiedlin, lean toward bouncy, guitar-driven pop with engaging female harmonies that recall such 1980s Go-Gos hits as "Our Lips are Sealed" and "We've Got the Beat". But the songs on Tangled are more complex and varied. No two tracks sound alike, perhaps because no two were written by the same team. Love is a common theme on the album. But love has many faces and Wiedlin takes a good look at a number of them. The title track is about the tangled emotions that arise when a love goes bad but the need for love remains. Wiedlin explores the other side of the coin in "Big Rock Candy Mountain," in which a woman jaded by too many heartbreaks can hardly believe it when she finally finds the real thing. "World on Fire," the first single from the album, is a playful, pumped-up scorcher that contains the memorable line, "I feel the flames of love climbing up my pantvhose".""
On June 24, 1990, Newsday writer John Anderson reviewed the album and stated ""As a member of the Go-Go's, Jane Wiedlin helped create a sugary froth of rock and roll that was fun but ultimately forgettable (as it was supposed to be). On her new album, "Tangled", Wiedlin creates pop rooted in '60s guitar rock and ringing with defiant optimism. It's persistent and irresistible.""
In the San Jose Mercury News of July 29, 1990, a review of the album stated ""The tunes on "Tangled" are gracefully engaging pop, setting Wiedlin's pixie trill amid brisk, simple waves of guitar.""
In a San Francisco Bay Times article based on The Go-Go's from November 25, 2010, writer Pollo Del Mar had mentioned ""From Dec. 2-23 at CounterPULSE Theatre, the former member of The Go-Go’s – whose 1990 solo album "Tangled" I fell in love with in college — plays a very special guest in the upcoming holiday run of The Golden Girls. Sitting face-to-face with Jane during our first rehearsal, there was no way I could keep my mind from wandering to those days so long ago and the impact her musical career had on me.""

The music video premiered on BBC Radio 1's website on 29 September 2008. It was recorded at the Great South Wall in Dublin. Before recording began, Dublin radio station FM104 had a competition for a listener to appear in the music video. The music video shows clips of the band's home city of Dublin, Ireland and the band performing. The video almost created minor controversy when Danny O'Donoghue's ex-girlfriend was supposed to be cast as an extra but this was avoided when the producers chose a different girl. The band performed "Breakeven" on an episode of "The Paul O'Grady Show" which aired on 30 October 2008. On 14 October 2009, they performed "Breakeven" on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" in the United States. The video was number 2 on the 2010 VH1's Top 40 Videos of the Year.

Hans Mustad

Hans Mustad (1837 – 1918) was a Norwegian businessperson. He was instrumental in shaping the company O. Mustad & Søn.
He was born in Vardal as the son of Ole Hovelsen Mustad. He was a brother of Kristian Mauritz Mustad and uncle of Sigbjørn Mustad; both were jurists and politicians. Ole Hovelsen Mustad was a politician and businessperson who ran the company "O. Mustad", inherited from Hans Mustad's grandfather Hans Schikkelstad in 1843. Hans Mustad married Marie Heyerdahl in 1865. She was a granddaughter of Hieronymus Heyerdahl,
Hans Mustad started his working career in 1857, when hired in his father's company. They specialized in production of steel wire and nails, and also ran a foundry and a sawmill. In 1874 Hans Mustad became co-owner, and the company name was changed to O. Mustad & Søn, reflecting the new ownership structure. Under the involvement of Hans Mustad, the production was diversified. First, new products such as horse shoes, axe heads and fish hooks were introduced. In addition, the company expanded to other cities. In 1875 the company bought property at Lilleaker in Kristiania, adjacent to the Lysaker river. With a nearby waterfall at Fåbrofossen, this location had a history of industry stretching back to the nail works owned by poet Christian Braunmann Tullin, which existed from 1749 to 1830. From 1874 the lot was vacant, due to the explosion and subsequent move of the local nitroglycerine factory. In 1876 the production of nails and some other iron- and steelware was moved from Vardal to Lilleaker. In 1886 a factory was established in Finland. In 1889 the foundry was moved to Lilleaker, and the same year a margarine factory was established, entering a new branch of business. In addition, the factory at Vardal started production of fishing flies.
In the meantime, Ole Hovelsen Mustad had died (1884), leaving Hans Mustad as the single owner. His five sons became co-owners in 1905. These were Ole Mustad, Jr. (1870–1954), Hans Clarin Hovind Mustad (1871–1948), Halfdan Magnus Mustad (1874–1967), Wilhelm Martin Christie Mustad (1877–1961) and Nicolai Christian Mustad (1878–1970). They subsequently inherited the company upon Hans Mustad's death in 1918. By that time, O. Mustad & Søn was the largest industrial company in Norway, with 2,000 domestic employees as well as several factories abroad. The company eventually became the world's largest producer of fish hooks. Despite the ownership change, the name O. Mustad & Søn was kept. However, not long after its 1970 conversion to a limited company, it was split into different branches. 1977 saw the split into "Mustad Industrier AS" and "Mustad International Group BV", whereas the former was split into "Mustad AS", "Mustad Industrier AS" and "Mustad Eiendom AS" in 1997.

A Linnebach lantern or Linnebach projector is a lensless projection system used in theatrical productions. It was developed by (and named after) Adolf Linnebach in the early 20th century. Since the middle of the 20th century, it has largely been replaced by other projection technologies.
The lantern consists of a long case that is painted black on the inside. The case contains a high-powered lamp. One side of the case is a transparent slide with the image that is to be projected. Projection is often done from behind onto a translucent material. A system of lenses can optionally be used to prevent distortion of the projected image.

Aux arbres citoyens

"Aux arbres citoyens" is a 2007 song recorded by French singer Yannick Noah. It was his second single from his successful album "Charango", on which it features as third track, and his 12th single overall. Released on February 2007, the song became a hit in France, where it was Noah's first number-one hit, and in Belgium (Wallonia).
Song information.
The song was written and the music composed by Christophe Battaglia and Cyril Tarquiny. The title refers to the line "Aux armes, citoyens!" in the chorus of "La Marseillaise" but the words 'aux armes' ('to arms') are replaced by 'aux arbres' ('to the trees'), because the song deals with an ecological theme, explaining in the lyrics the need to mobilize to find solutions. The music video was produced as an animated feature and illustrates the lyrics.
The song was included on many French compilations, such as "Hit Connection - Best of 2007", "NRJ Summer Hits Only 2007", "Été 2007" and "M6 Hits".
On French TV show "La Chanson de l'année", hosted by Flavie Flament on TF1 on June 1, 2007, "Aux arbres citoyens" was awarded "Song of the Year" thanks to an exclusive poll directed by the IFOP, among about 50 songs released in 2007.
In France, the single went straight to number-one on February 17, 2007, and stayed there for three weeks. It totaled 12 weeks in the top ten and 20 weeks in the top 50. It fell off the chart (top 100) after 26 weeks and is currently Noah's fourth biggest hit in France, behind "La Voix des Sages (No More Fighting)", "Saga Africa (ambiance secousse)" and "Simon Papa Tara".
The single entered the Belgian chart at #28 on February 17, 2007, climbed regularly and finally peaked at #2 in its eighth and ninth week. It stayed for 12 weeks in the top ten and 26 weeks on the chart, becoming Noah's second longest chart trajectory for one of his singles in Belgium (Wallonia).

Orlando Fals Borda

Orlando Fals Borda (Barranquilla, 11 July 1925 - Bogotá, 12 August 2008) was a Colombian researcher and sociologist, one of the most important Latin American thinkers, and one of the founders of participatory action research. Together with Father Camilo Torres Restrepo, in 1959 he set up the first sociology faculty in Latin America at the National University of Colombia. His perspective built a singular bond between science and politics that changed dramatically the relations between society and knowledge. He also played a key role of the foundation of CLACSO (Latin American Social Science Council) at the end of the sixties. An essential part of his effort was centered on the construction of a perspective from the border and the periphery, focused on the subordination conditions of the Latin American societies. A polemic thinker and militant, Fals Borda developed an ethical conception of the subversion based on a particular method of analysis and a praxis called "positive subversion" through the idea of "compromise". Fals Borda's perspective also contributed to develop some recent critical interpretations, such as postcolonialism linked to the analysis of the effects of modernity/coloniality on the South.

Palle Huld

Palle Huld (2 August 1912 – 26 November 2010) was a Danish film actor and writer. He appeared in 40 films between 1933 and 2000. He was born in Hellerup in Denmark. His journey around the world at the age of 15 in 1928 reportedly inspired Hergé to create Tintin.
The Danish newspaper "Politiken" held a competition in honour of Jules Verne which was open only to teenaged boys. The winner would be assisted in a challenge to circumnavigate the globe within 46 days unaccompanied. They were allowed to use all forms of transport apart from aviation. There were several hundred applications for this competition. Huld was 15 at the time and working in a car dealership as a clerk. Huld left on his voyage on 1 March 1928, a journey that took him through the following countries, nameley (besides Denmark): England, Scotland, Canada, Japan, Korea, China (Manchuria), The Soviet Union, Poland and Germany.

Perceived visual angle

In human visual perception, the visual angle, denoted "θ", subtended by a viewed object sometimes looks larger or smaller than its actual value. One approach to this phenomenon posits a subjective correlate to the visual angle: the perceived visual angle or perceived angular size. An optical illusion where the physical and subjective angles differ is then called a visual angle illusion or angular size illusion.
Angular size illusions are most obvious as relative angular size illusions, in which two objects that subtend the same visual angle appear to have different angular sizes; it is as if their equal-sized images on the retina were of different sizes. Angular size illusions are contrasted with linear size illusions, in which two objects that are the same physical size do not appear so. An angular size illusion may be accompanied by (or cause) a linear size illusion at the same time.
The perceived visual angle paradigm begins with a rejection of the classical size–distance invariance hypothesis (SDIH), which states that the ratio of perceived linear size to perceived distance is a simple function of the visual angle. The SDIH does not explain some illusions, such as the Moon illusion, in which the Moon appears larger when it is near the horizon. It is replaced by a perceptual SDIH, in which the visual angle is replaced by the perceived visual angle. This new formulation avoids some of the paradoxes of the SDIH, but it remains difficult to explain why a given illusion occurs.
This paradigm is not universally accepted; many textbook explanations of size and distance perception do not refer to the perceived visual angle, and some researchers deny that it exists. Some recent evidence supporting the idea, reported by Murray, Boyaci and Kersten (2006), suggests a direct relationship between the perceived angular size of an object and the size of the neural activity pattern it excites in the primary visual cortex.
A relatively new idea.
Visual angle illusions have been explicitly described by many vision researchers, including , , , Baird (1970), Ono (1970), Roscoe (1985, 1989), Hershenson (1982, 1989), Reed (1984, 1989), Enright (1989), Plug & Ross (1989, 1994), Higashiyama & Shimono (1994), Gogel, & Eby (1997), Ross & Plug (2002), and Murray, Boyaci & Kersten (2006). Specifically, these researchers cited have advocated a relatively new idea: that many of the best-known size illusions demonstrate that for most observers the (subjective) perceived visual angle, "θ′", can change for a viewed target that subtends a constant (physical) visual angle "θ".
Indeed, various experiments have revealed most of the factors responsible for these visual angle illusions, and a few different explanations for them have been published (Baird, Wagner, & Fuld, 1990, Enright, 1987, 1989, Hershenson, 1982, 1989, Komoda & Ono, 1974, McCready, 1965, 1985, 1986, 1994, Ono, 1970, Oyama, 1977, Reed, 1984, 1989, Restle, 1970, Roscoe, 1985, 1989).
On the other hand, nearly all discussions (and explanations) of those classic size illusions found in textbooks, the popular media, and on the internet use, instead, an older hypothesis that the visual angle is not perceivable (Gregory, 2008, Kaufman & Kaufman, 2002). They can describe and explain only a linear size illusion, which is why they do not properly describe or explain the illusions that most people experience.
In order to clarify the new paradigm which replaces the old one, it helps to keep in mind that an angle is the difference between two directions from a common point (the vertex). Accordingly, as described below, the visual angle "θ" is the difference between two real (optical) directions in the field of view, while the perceived visual angle "θ′", is the difference by which the directions of two viewed points from oneself appear to differ in the visual field.
Physical measures "S", "D", "R", and "θ".
Figure 1 illustrates an observer's eye looking at a frontal extent AB that has a linear size "S" (also called its "metric size" or "tape-measure size"). The extent's lower endpoint at B lies at a distance "D" from point O, which for present purposes can represent the center of the eye's entrance pupil.
The line from B through O indicates the chief ray of the bundle of light rays that form the optical image of B on the retina at point b, let's say, on the fovea. Likewise, endpoint A is imaged at point a.
The optical (physical) angle between those chief rays is the visual angle "θ" which can be calculated:
The retinal images at b and a are separated by the distance "R", given by the equation
in which "n" is the eye's nodal distance that averages about 17 mm. That is, a viewed object's retinal image size is approximately given by .
The line from point O outward through object point B specifies the optical direction, "d"B, of the object's base from the eye, let's say toward the horizon. The line from point O through point A specifies that endpoint's optical direction, "d"A, toward some specific elevation value (say, 18 degrees). The difference between those real directions () is, again, the visual angle "θ".
Perceived measures.
Figure 2 diagrams the perceived (subjective) values for a viewed object.
Point O′ represents the place from which the observer feels that he or she is viewing the world. For present purposes, O′ can represent the cyclopean eye (Ono, 1970, Ono, Mapp & Howard, 2002).
Perceived linear values "D′" and "S′".
In Figure 2, "D′" is the perceived distance of the subjective point B′ from O′. The observer might simply say how far away point B′ looks, in inches or meters or miles.
Similarly, "S′" is the perceived linear extent by which the subjective point A′ appears directly above point B′. The observer could simply say how many inches or meters that vertical distance looks. For a viewed object, "S′" thus is its perceived linear size in meters, (or apparent linear size).
Perceived visual angle "θ′".
The perceived endpoint at B′ has the perceived direction, "d′"B, and the observer might simply say "it looks straight ahead and toward the horizon."
This concept of the (subjective) visual direction is very old. However, as Wade, Ono & Mapp (2006) noted, it unfortunately has been ignored in many current theories of size perception, and size illusions.
The object's other perceived endpoint, A′, has a perceived direction "d′"A;, about which the observer might say "it appears toward a higher elevation than point B′." The difference between the two perceived directions () is the perceived visual angle "θ′", also called the perceived angular size or apparent angular size.
It is not easy to quantify "θ′". For instance, a well-trained observer might say that point A′ "looks about 25 degrees higher" than B′, but most cannot reliably say how large a direction difference looks. That skill is not practiced because it is easier to use pointing gestures (Ono, 1970): For example, one often tells another person about the change in the directions seen for two viewed points by pointing something, say a finger or the eyes from one point to the other.
Therefore, in some experiments the observers aimed a pointer from one viewed point to the other, so the angle through which the pointer rotated was the measure of "θ′", (Komodo, 1970, Komodo & Ono, 1974, Ono, Muter, & Mitson, 1974, Gogel & Eby, 1997).
Also, because "θ′", specifies the amount by which one should rotate one's eye to quickly look from one seen point to another eye tracking, saccade, observers in other experiments shifted their gaze from one object endpoint to the other, and the angle the eye rotated through was measured as "θ′" for that object (Yarbus (1967).
Difference between "θ′" and "S′".
It is important to understand how "θ′" differs from "S′". Consider an example illustrated by the sketch at the right.
Suppose one is looking through a window at a house 240 feet away, so it subtends a visual angle of about 7 degrees. The window opening is 10 feet away, so it subtends a visual angle of 14 degrees.
It can be said that the house "looks larger and farther away" than the window, meaning that the perceived linear size "S′" for the house's width is much larger than "S′" for the window; for instance a person might say the house "looks about 40 feet wide" and the window "looks about 3 feet wide."
One can also say that the house "looks smaller and farther away" than the window, and that does not contradict the other statement because now we mean that the amount ("θ′") by which directions of the house's edges appear to differ is, say, about half the apparent direction difference for the window edges.
Notice that humans experience both the linear size and the angular size comparisons at the same time, along with the distance comparison (Joynson, 1949). Thus any report merely that one object "looks larger" than another object is ambiguous. It needs to specify whether "looks larger" refers to the perceived angular size ("θ′") or to the perceived linear size ("S′") or to both of those qualitatively different "size" experiences (Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985, Ono, 1970). Notice that in everyday conversations "looks larger" often refers to an angular size comparison rather than a linear size comparison.
Additional confusion has resulted from widespread use of the ambiguous terms "apparent size" and "perceived size", because they sometimes have referred to "θ′" and sometimes to "S′" without clarification, so the reader must try to ascertain what they mean. Also, in astronomy, "apparent size" refers to the physical angle "θ" rather than to the "subjective" apparent visual angle "θ′".
The perceptual size–distance invariance hypothesis.
How the three perceived values "θ′", "S′", and "D′" would be expected to relate to each other for a given object is illustrated by Figure 2 and stated by the following equation (McCready, 1965, 1985, Ono, 1970, Komoda and Ono, 1974, Reed, 1989, Kaneko & Uchikawa, 1997).
Ross & Plug (2002, Page 31) dubbed this new rule the "perceptual size–distance invariance hypothesis".
Retinal size, "cortical size" and "θ′".
As already noted, the magnitude of an object's visual angle "θ" determines the size "R" of its retinal image. And, the size of the retinal image normally determines the extent of the neural activity pattern the retina's neural activity eventually generates in the primary visual cortex, area V1 or Brodmann area 17. This cortical area harbors a distorted but spatially isomorphic "map" of the retina (see Retinotopy). This neurological relationship recently was confirmed by Murray, Boyaci, & Kersten (2006) using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
The retinal image is not perceived or sensed. That is, experimental psychologists long ago rejected any idea that people "sense" a proximal stimulus such as the retinal image. As Gogel (1969, 1997) has repeatedly emphasized, there is no "sensation" which could be called the "perceived retinal image size", "R′".
Also rejected is a popular idea that an object's "perceived size" results from a "scaling of retinal size"; an illogical process that somehow "magnifies" the very small "retinal size" to yield the viewed object's much larger perceived linear size "S′".
Instead, the physical retinal extent "R" normally determines the magnitude of the perceived visual angle "θ′". But, as already noted, "other factors" can intervene to slightly change "θ′" for a target forming a constant sized retinal image (and thereby create a visual angle illusion). Indeed, the major discovery by Murray et al. (2006) concerns this flexible relationship between "R" and "θ′", as described below.
Visual angle illusions and area V1.
The Murray, et al. (2006) observers viewed a flat picture with two disks that subtended the same visual angle "θ" and formed retinal images of the same size ("R"), but the perceived angular size, "θ′", for one disk was larger than "θ′" for the other (say, 17% larger) due to differences in their background patterns. And, in cortical Area V1, the sizes of the activity patterns related to the disks were unequal, despite the fact that the retinal images were the same size. The difference between these "cortical sizes" in Area V1 for the illusion disks was essentially the same as the difference produced by two non-illusory disks whose retinal image sizes differed by, say, 17%.
The researchers pointed out that their findings dramatically disagree with the hypothetical models of neural events being proposed in nearly all current theories of visual spatial perception.
Murray, et al. (2006) also noted that the flat illusion pattern they used can represent other classic "size" illusions, such as the Ponzo illusion and, as well, the moon illusion which is a visual angle illusion for most observers, (McCready, 1965, 1986, Restle 1970, Plug & Ross, 1989, p. 21, Ross & Plug, 2002).
A detailed meta-analysis of the Murray et al. (2006) results is available in McCready (2007, Appendix B).
The size–distance paradox.
The classical size–distance invariance hypothesis.
Conventional "textbook" theories of "size" and distance perception do not refer to the perceived visual angle (e.g., Gregory, 1963, 1970, 1998, 2008) and some researchers even deny that it exists (Kaufman & Kaufman, 2002). This idea that one does not see the different directions in which objects lie from oneself is a basis of the so-called "size–distance invariance hypothesis" (SDIH).
That old SDIH logic (geometry) is typically illustrated using a diagram that resembles Figure 2, but has the physical visual angle "θ" substituted for the perceived visual angle "θ′". The equation for the SDIH thus is
Here, "S′" is typically called the "perceived size" or "apparent size"; more precisely it is the perceived linear size, measured in meters.
When rearranged as , the equation expresses Emmert's law.
However, at least since 1962, researchers have pointed out that many classic "size" and distance illusions can be neither described nor explained using the SDIH, so a new hypothesis is needed (Boring 1962, Gruber, 1956, McCready, 1965, Baird, 1970, Ono 1970). For instance, consider the simple Ebbinghaus illusion.
Example: the Ebbinghaus illusion.
The two central circles are the same linear size "S" and the same viewing distance "D", so they subtend the same visual angle "θ" and form equal-sized retinal images. But the lower one "looks larger" than the upper one.
According to the SDIH, "looks larger" can mean only that "S′" is greater, and with the physical angle "θ" the same for both, the SDIH requires that "D′" be greater for the lower one than for the upper one. However, for most observers, both circles appear unequal while also appearing at the same distance (on the same page).
This commonly found disagreement between published data and the SDIH is known as the "size–distance paradox" (Gruber, 1956, Ono, et al. 1974).
The "paradox" completely vanishes, however, when the illusion is described, instead, as basically a visual angle illusion: That is, the perceived visual angle "θ′" is larger for the lower circle than for the upper circle: It is as if its retinal image were larger. So. according to the "new" perceptual invariance hypothesis, (), with "θ′" larger for the lower circle, and with "D′" correctly the same for both circles, then "S′" becomes larger for the lower one by the same ratio that "θ′" is larger. That is, the reason the lower one looks a larger linear size on the page is because it looks a larger angular size than the upper one.
Explaining visual angle illusions remains difficult.
The new hypothesis that includes "θ′" along with "S′" describes the Ebbinghaus illusion and many other classic "size" illusions more completely and more logically than does the popular SDIH. What still needs to be explained, however, is why the basic visual angle illusion occurs in each example.
Describing the few existing explanations for visual angle illusions is beyond the scope of this present entry. The most recent theories have been presented mostly in articles concerning the moon illusion (Baird et al., 1990, Enright, 1989a, 1989b, Hershenson, 1982, 1989b, Higashiyama, 1992, McCready 1986, 1999–2007, Plug & Ross, 1989, Reed, 1989, Roscoe, 1989, and especially in two "moon illusion" books (Hershenson, 1989; Ross & Plug, 2002) which make it quite clear that vision scientists have not yet agreed upon any particular theory of visual angle illusions.
There also is the lesser-known, but evidently the largest visual angle illusion of oculomotor micropsia (convergence micropsia) for which a few different explanations are being considered (McCready, 1965, 2007, Ono, 1970, Komoda & Ono, 1974, Ono, et al. 1974, Enright, 1987b, 1989a, 1989b).
This is a partial list of "size and distance" illusions that begin as visual angle illusions (angular size illusions) for most observers.

Gold Coast hinterland

The Gold Coast hinterland is an area of South East Queensland, Australia that comprises the Tweed Range, Nimmel Range, Tamborine Mountain, Numinbah Valley, eastern parts of the McPherson Range and western parts of suburban Gold Coast.
History.
The comprehensive exploration of the area was conducted only as late as 1842. Surveyors attempted to map the Queensland/New South Wales border during the 1860s were hampered by the rough terrain and plateaus. Shortly after timber-getters passed Numinbah Gap from the Tweed Valley, establishing a route from the Tweed region to Brisbane that was later used by coach and bullock teams. In 1908, Witches Falls was protected by Queensland's first national park declaration.
Tourism.
In the Gold Coast hinterland there are various scenic attractions and guesthouses that have led to the development of a vibrant tourism industry, providing a major attraction for visitors to the Gold Coast and people living in the region. Visitor surveys to the hinterland's parks and forests indicate the area is one of Queensland's most significant tourist destinations. Wine-tasting, bird-feeding, eco-tourism and bushwalking are some of the pastimes that attract visitors to the hinterland. Other attractions in the area include O'Reilly's Guesthouse, the Natural Bridge and Binna Burra. In March 2008, the Gold Coast Hinterland Great Walk connecting the Lamington and Springbrook plateaus was opened. The moderately difficult walking trail provides 54 km of uninterrupted track and takes three days to walk from start to finish.
Geography.
This elevated area is part of the Great Dividing Range and contains the headwaters for a number of rivers and creeks including the Coomera River, Nerang River, Pimpama River, Tallebudgera Creek and Currumbin Creek. Some of the highest mountains in the hinterland are Mount Nimmel (489 m), Mount Tamborine (525 m), Mount Cougal at (739 m), Tallebudgera Mountain (664m) and Springbrook Mountain (900 m). In New South Wales to the south are the Tweed Valley and Border Ranges, while the Scenic Rim overlaps and extends westwards from the hinterland.
Suburbs and townships.
Land use in the hinterland is divided between protected areas and rural residential living. On the eastern foothills of the hinterland lie the Gold Coast suburbs of Mudgeeraba, Tallebudgera, Guanaba, Cedar Creek, Wongawallan, Mt Nathan, Maudsland and Nerang. There are a number of small villages like Advancetown, Beechmont and Canungra that are considered part of the hinterland. 
At the foot of Mount Nimmel lies Austinville and beyond, the towering plateau of Springbrook Mountain, on top of which lies a small township by the same name.
Protected areas.
The region has significant natural heritage that is preserved in national parks and has been a major tourist drawcard. Much of the national parks are UNESCO World Heritage listed as well as listed nationally as part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. Springbrook National Park covers 2720 hectares of rainforest, plenty of which is accessible by walking trails. Remnants of early forestry history await you as well as several waterfalls, including the famous Purlingbrook Falls, as well as many gorges and much rainforest.
Lamington National Park covers 20,590 hectares of rainforest, consisting mainly of two sections, the Green Mountains and Binna Burra. The longest available walk is 24 kilometres, about 8 hours walking time. Tamborine National Park covers 1160 hectares of the Tamborine Mountain, a remnant of the once giant Tweed Volcano.
Closer to the coast, although not technically part of the hinterland, is the Currumbin Valley Reserve.

Malta–Portugal relations

Malta–Portugal relations are foreign relations between Malta and Portugal. Malta has an embassy in Lisbon and 4 honorary consulates (in Algarve, Azores, Lisbon and Porto). Portugal has an embassy and an honorary consulate in Valletta. Both countries are full members of the European Union and of the Union for the Mediterranean.
State visits.
Eddie Fenech Adami, the President of Malta visited Portugal between November 11, 2008 and November 11, 2008. President Adamia made a two-day state visit to Portugal in June 2009. During his visit he held talks with his Portuguese counterpart Aníbal Cavaco Silva, the Prime Minister José Sócrates, and the President of Parliament Jaime José de Matos da Gama.
Trade.
In 2007, Antonio Russo Dias, the Portuguese Ambassador to Malta said: "I don’t think that the fact that Portugal has the EU Presidency now will be a factor in improving trade and economic links between Malta and Portugal. However there is a bilateral plan to improve these relations with the recent opening of embassies in the respective countries so, yes there certainly is the will to improve links. There might be increased awareness of Portugal through the EU Presidency but not a direct link, at least in my opinion". Portuguese Banif Bank opened its first branch in Malta in 2008 and projected that it will have up to "25 more branches within five years and secure 10 per cent of the market".
Diplomatic relations.
Russo Dias was Portugal's first resident ambassador to Malta, ending his mission in September 2008. According to Maltese Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi, relations between the two countries had reached unprecedented levels thanks to his efforts.
In June 2008 the Maltese ambassador in Portugal, Salv Stellini, paid a last call on Anibal Cavaco Silva, the President of Portugal, ending his tenure as Malta's resident Ambassador in Lisbon. Cavaco Silva thanked Stellini for his support in setting up the Portuguese Embassy in Malta, and appointed him a member of Portugal's Order of Merit.

Field-theoretic simulation

A field-theoretic simulation is a numerical strategy to calculate structure and physical properties of a many-particle system within the framework of a statistical field theory, like e.g. a polymer field theory. A convenient possibility is to use Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, to sample the full partition function integral expressed in field-theoretic representation. The
procedure is then called the auxiliary field Monte Carlo method. However, it is well known that MC sampling in conjunction with the basic field-theoretic representation of the partition function integral, directly obtained via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, is impracticable, due to the so-called numerical sign problem (Baeurle 2002, Fredrickson 2002). The
difficulty is related to the complex and oscillatory nature of the resulting distribution function, which causes a bad statistical convergence of the ensemble averages of the desired structural and thermodynamic quantities. In such cases special analytical and numerical techniques are required to accelerate the statistical convergence of the field-theoretic simulation (Baeurle 2003, Baeurle 2003a, Baeurle 2004).

To make the field-theoretic methodology amenable for computation, Baeurle proposed to shift the contour of integration of the partition function integral through the homogeneous mean field (MF) solution using Cauchy's integral theorem, which provides its so-called "mean-field representation". This strategy was previously successfully employed in field-theoretic electronic structure calculations (Rom 1997, Baer 1998). Baeurle could demonstrate that this technique provides a significant acceleration of the statistical convergence of the ensemble averages in the MC sampling procedure (Baeurle 2002).
Gaussian equivalent representation.
In subsequent works Baeurle et al. (Baeurle 2002, Baeurle 2002a) applied the concept of tadpole renormalization, which originates from quantum field theory and leads to the "Gaussian equivalent representation" of the partition function integral, in conjunction with advanced MC techniques in the grand canonical ensemble. They could convincingly demonstrate that this strategy provides an additional boost in the statistical convergence of the desired ensemble averages (Baeurle 2002).
Alternative techniques.
Other promising field-theoretic simulation techniques have been developed recently, but they either still lack the proof of correct statistical convergence, like e.g. the Complex Langevin method (Ganesan 2001), and/or still need to prove their effectiveness on systems, where multiple saddle points are important (Moreira 2003).

Malta–Spain relations

Maltese-Spanish relations are foreign relations between Malta and Spain. Both countries has established diplomatic relations since 1977 . Malta has an embassy in Madrid and 5 honorary consulates (in Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Santander, Seville and Valencia). Spain has an embassy in Valletta. 
Both countries are full members of the European Union and of the Union for the Mediterranean.
Migration issues.
In December 2008, the two countries agreed to collaborate on issues relating to illegal migration, including repatriation. In a meeting between Home Affairs Minister Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici and his Spanish counterpart Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, they agreed that the implementation of the Immigration and Asylum Pact was a priority. The two countries agreed that a group of Spanish police should be sent to Malta in 2009 to help the Maltese force with repatriation.
Agreements.
In January 2007, the two countries entered into a tax treaty.

Victorian Railways livestock transport

The Victorian Railways used a variety of railway wagons for the transport of livestock.
History.
One of the commodities carried by the early Victorian Railways was livestock. Also, from the mid-19th century, horse vans were employed to transfer racing horses from stations on country branch lines, to the nearest racecourse.
By the 1950s the rise of road transport saw the loss of a number of short branch lines, particularly those where the only traffic had been timber or livestock. From 1974 to the 1980s intrastate road freight was deregulated, and rail 'common carrier' obligations were removed, resulting in the loss of to road of much non-bulk freight.
By 1979 only a small number of livestock wagons remained in service, approximately 50 vehicles in two main classes: one double deck for sheep and pigs, and the other single deck for cattle. The carriage of livestock by rail finally ended in 1986.
Cattle wagons.
M wagons and variations.
Starting in 1897 and finishing in the 1950s, a total of 879 M class cattle wagons were constructed. The design was relatively standard, remaining unchanged up to wagon no.779. Wagons 780 to 879 had altered ends and the GY handbrake system.
As per the normal practice of the era, scrapped wagons were replaced with new wagons of the same numbers, from 1893 to 1925.
Three wagons were fitted with altered roofs, and were used in circus traffic. They were known as the "elephant wagons" and lasted until about 1930, when they were replaced with new vans constructed from steel.
During the Autocoupler Conversion project of the 1920s, severe shortages of louvre vans occurred. As a result, 50 M vans were boarded up and reclassed to MU to fill the gap. They were used for all sorts of traffic, even for bagged wheat in 1923. The vans were all converted back to M by 1934.
The MU numbers can be found on Peter J Vincent's site, but they ranged from the low 300's to the mid 400's.
Around the early 1960s there was a shortage of wagons for carrying superphosphate. Due to the lack of alternatives, even with over 24,000 wagons running at the time, 70 cattle wagons were lined with tarpaulins on the inside, and loaded by hand. They were reclassed as the MS wagons. By the 1970s they were either scrapped or returned to M wagon status.
By the 1970s containerisation was starting to become popular, and so the M-series wagons were slowly being replaced by MC containers, which could be placed on container wagons. This was not for transshipment purposes, but because when the cattle fitting was not in use the container wagon could be used in regular traffic.
Around the mid-1980s the laws of cattle transport changed, and this deregulation caused cattle transport to vanish from the rails practically overnight. The remaining M wagons were sold or scrapped, and the MC containers were stored for years before being sold off interstate.
MM wagons.
As cattle traffic increased it was found that more wagons were needed. The Victorian Railways decided on a bogie design rather than more four-wheelers. So in 1928, 25 vans were constructed, the MM class.
When built the MM's had half the autocoupler equipment fitted, but had transition hooks for compatibility purposes. These were swapped for the full automatic couplers between 1933 and 1936.
From 1965 the wagons had bogies altered for higher speed trains, and so the wagons were reclassed MF. This lasted until the 1979 recoding, by which time only wagons 2-5, 10, 15, 20-22 and 25 remained. These 10 wagons were reclassed to VSBY, indicating that they were not bogie-exchangeable.
The wagons were removed from service in the mid-1980s.
MB wagons.
In 1969 2 M wagons were specially converted for the carriage of bulls between Melbourne and Wodonga. The modification was the removal of one plank from each side of the wagon, which was then replaced by a metal lashing rail to which a bull could be secured. MB1 was converted from M416 and MB2 was converted from M391. Neither appears to have been recoded to four letter codes.
Sheep wagons.
L, LB wagons.
The first L class sheep truck was constructed in 1877, and construction continued through to 1953. The class was numbered from 1 to 1432, but of this, about 30 numbers did not get used. Because of the aforementioned policy of reusing numbers, there were about 1,650 of these wagons built. Over time, older wagons were scrapped and newer wagons, of a more modern design, were built with the same numbers as the scrapped L wagons.
This was shown most obviously, because wagons up to L1236, built up to December 1924, are fitted with gable roofs. The final 196 wagons, numbers 1237 and on, have curved roofs and were built with auto-couplers from new.
The wagons could be used for pigs and goats as well as sheep, but the latter was the primary traffic. Because of this the wagons often ran in groups, but these were not defined on paper.
Most of the gable-roof vans were auto-coupled between 1931 and 1933. However, 50 of the wagons were only fitted with auto-couplers at one end, and this was used to semi-permanently couple them in pairs, with the chain couplings on the outside of these pairs. The wagons were relettered to LB, and marked to show they were not to be uncoupled in regular service. This was done to speed up the conversion process. The wagons were then later fully auto-coupled, and relettered to L. All 50 had been completed by the mid-1950s.
It would probably be possible to find out which wagons were paired by looking at workshop records, but this has as yet not been attempted.
By 1960 there were only 1,260 wagons on the register.
LL 4-wheel wagons.
There were three wagons in this rather unusual class. Their description on records implies that they were either used half-and-half for livestock and general goods, or they were used for the latter and occasionally the former, hopefully being washed out afterwards!
LL 1 was built in October 1886. It was converted to replace the scrapped L7 sheep van in 1891 and renumbered to L7. It was scrapped in 1904. LL 2 was built in March 1889. It was converted to replace the scrapped L8 sheep van in 1891 and renumbered to L8. It was placed "off register" in 1907.
However, LL 3 had a completely different history. It was built in New South Wales in September 1889. The wagon was scrapped in 1891, when its classmates were converted to regular L wagons.
But in 1896 the underframe was used to build the replacement K5 flat truck. In this reincarnation it was fitted with water tanks. Thirteen years later it was placed 'off Register'. In its third life, in 1910, it became K 112, a Crane Truck. In 1911 the original K 112 was found running, and so the duplicate ex K 5 was returned to that number, which it kept. It was scrapped in 1927, but was not found in the 1925 stocktake.
LL, LF, LP, VSAY bogie wagons.
As with the MM wagons, extra capacity was needed for sheep transport in 1928. Wagons LL1 to LL50 were constructed, resembling two L wagons joined together and placed on bogies. Each wagon was capable of holding 50 sheep per compartment for a total of 200.
The wagons were also unusual in that they had two waybill clips, so that one half of the wagn could be used by one owner, and the other half for another person's sheep.
In the late 1960s ten wagons were classed LP and placed on passenger bogies, while the remainder became the LF series and had freight bogies fitted.
The LP's had a maximum speed 10 mph higher than the LF's; 70 mph. They also had tail discs and side lamp brackets, making them suitable for trailing a passenger train. The vans were converted from LL 16, 28, 45, 27, 44, 12, 15, 6, 8 and 50 respectively. They were used between Mildura and Ouyen.
By 1974 traffic requirements changed, and the LP class was converted to LF, resuming their old LL numbers.
In the 1979 recoding, the LF class were relettered to VSAY. By then, 12 of the wagons had been scrapped. The remainder were removed from service in the 1980s.
Horse wagons.
Fixed wheel vehicles.
From 1854 to 1914, horse transport wagons were constructed as required. Their codes all started with F, but the designs varied over the years.
The wagons were originally four-wheeled with curved ends (probably for storage). The 1890s design featured six wheels, with the number of stalls doubled from three to six.
In 1894 a new four-wheel van, F52, entered service with a greater capacity than other vehicles in the class. This van was recoded to FF between 1894 and 1897.
The curved end wagons were all scrapped by the 1880s. The smaller capacity wagons were mostly rebuilt to a larger capacity between 1905 and 1910. They were then joined by the FF class, with the entire series being lettered F. This was made possible by the scrapping of the smaller capacity wagons. However, records between 1904 and 1914 are vague, and so it cannot be known which numbers had what done to them and when.
The traffic had mostly evaporated by the 1940s, so the remaining horse wagons were altered to OH and HD vans for general maintenance.
Bogie vehicles.
In 1889 the first of six bogie horse wagons entered service, classed FF. Between 1894 and 1897 a larger four-wheel F wagon (F52) was relettered to FF, and so the bogie vehicles were relettered to FFF. This was reversed in the 1910 recodings.
Ten more bogie vans were built in the late 1920s, numbers 7 through 16.
In the mid-1950s most of the class was altered in some way or another. FF’s 1 and 8 were scrapped, while FF’s 2-6 were modified for overhead construction on the Traralgon line and became OH 1-5. The underframes of FF 9 and FF 11 became Q 130 and 131 respectively, in 1953. The former was used as the crane jib support for Crane 45 and FF's 7, 10, 12 and 13, which had received upgraded bogies fitted during the 1940s, were reclassed FP in 1956.
By 1975 FP 7 was the only wagon in service, but two underframes were stored. In the 1979 recoding FP7 became VSPY 7. By the mid-1990s the wagon was moved to storage at Newport.
In 1961 the three remaining FF bogie horseboxes, 14, 15 and 16, were recoded to FH. All three wagons had their bodies scrapped in 1962/1963, but the underframe of FH 16 was rebuilt as HW1, the body supplied by two HW vans. The two van bodies were joined to become a bogie vehicle.
Guard's Van with horsebox.
In 1901 a guard's van was built with a horse stall. It was numbered as DFDF1, and was built with money allocated to replace van D69, which had been destroyed at Fairfield.
In 1905 the van was modified and expanded to three horse stalls, intended for use on the Warburton Line.
In 1906 it was renumbered to DD45, then to C43 in 1910. In 1956 the van was given a new incarnation as the second Carey, a shower vehicle. This was to replace the original Carey, which was wrecked at Seymour a few months earlier.
Narrow Gauge.
NMM Class.
This class consisted of 15 vehicles. Construction started in 1899, but the first NMM did not enter service until 1903. After this the rest of the class followed slowly, with the last of the class not entering service until 1917. The looked similar to the MM cattle trucks, despite being built 25 years earlier.
As part of the late 1920s recoding, the class was altered to NM. Around the same time, all but the class leader had autocouplers fitted (1 NM was not converted until 1941).
In the mid-1920s there was a derailment on the Moe – Walhalla line. In the consist were NM vehicles. It was determined that the derailment was caused by "spooked" horses in an NM vehicle. The vehicle was coupled next to an NA tank engine which was running bunker first. The smoke from the funnel apparently was the reason for the distress. After this investigation, the ends of all the NM class were progressively boarded up.
As the Narrow Gauge lines were closed the wagons were sold off. Most were scrapped; 13 NM is used by Puffing Billy on wood trains, and 6 NM was recently rescued from a farm and is currently in storage awaiting restoration.
Liveries.
In general, livestock wagons have been painted in Victorian Railways Wagon Red livery. The L sheep wagons had creamy-white floors, and some horse transports were dark grey, but those are the only exceptions.
Model railways and train simulators.
There is a version of the M and MB wagons currently released on the Trainz download station, created by user S301, link requires TRS registration.
<br>In HO scale, Steam Era Models produces kits for both the M and L 4-wheel wagons. The former could probably be converted to "Elephant", MB or MS variations, though the MU would be difficult. Also, PSM/Train Hobby released a brass version of the L sheep wagon years ago, but these are rare today, often selling for over $400. They are also incorrect in that the floors are brown, not white. Both versions of the L wagons are for gable roofs, not the later curved roofs. Precision Scale Models have recently released brass models of the MM and LL bogie wagons.

Joy (House)

"Joy" is the sixth episode of the fifth season of "House" and the ninety-second episode overall. It aired on October 28, 2008.
Plot.
The episode opens with a single father, Jerry, repeatedly pouring himself a mug of coffee and then dumping it in the sink. The clock shows just before 8:30am. He then speaks to his daughter, Samantha, who leaves the house for school. Overall, the father and daughter's interactions are listless and unemotional, and almost robotic - apparently both are unable to experience "joy". Seemingly seconds after Samantha leaves, she returns, while Jerry discovers his coffee makers missing from the counter and questions Samantha why she is home, to which she responds, "It's 4:30 in the afternoon, and I live here." Jerry realizes he has lost time or must have blacked out while she was gone and does not know what's wrong. At Princeton-Plainsboro, Cuddy assigns his case to House. 
Foreman figures out from pupil examination that the man is a somnambulist, and Taub and Thirteen are assigned to follow the patient during his sleepwalking episodes. They trail him by car while he drives ahead of them, and discover he is buying cocaine while asleep. The team approach the dealer that sold the cocaine to Jerry and ask to buy it themselves, hoping to find the answer to his condition. After running tests, they discover it was cut with lactose. House deduces that the man is lactose-intolerant and treats him, but Jerry's condition continues to deteriorate, as Taub notices he literally begins sweating blood during an examination and his kidneys fail. House persuades Samantha to donate a kidney to her father. Her monotone expression and glum one-word answers prompt him to realize that she is a sleepwalker too, and is suffering from the same condition as her father.
Meanwhile, Cuddy meets with Becca, the mother of the baby she is hoping to adopt. Cuddy is curious to know why Becca chose her to adopt her baby, and she is told that her father and grandfather were abusive men, and that she did not want her baby going through that as well, and also the fact that Cuddy's credentials impressed her. But things begin to go wrong, as Cuddy notices Becca has an odd rash on her arm, and she hospitalizes her in order to treat her. She and Cameron perform an ultrasound and see that the baby's lungs are underdeveloped. Cameron orders a treatment of steroids for Becca, but it causes Becca to have a sub-uterine bleed. Cuddy is extremely concerned for the baby's health, which draws House's attention. He insults Cuddy's parenting skills and questions her motives for wanting to be a mother. He also berates her for agreeing with him to deliver the baby now, as that would be a serious risk to the baby's lungs, and he tells her "You can give the mom more blood; cannot give the fetus more lungs!" Cuddy consults Becca, who does not want to sacrifice anymore. She asks Cuddy to deliver the baby. She and the surgical team successfully deliver baby Joy via cesarean section, and Joy begins to cry on her own, which means, to the relief of everyone, that her lungs were developed enough for her to breathe on her own.
After a conversation with Wilson, House consults his patients, and Jerry reveals that he is of Middle-Eastern descent, and changed his Muslim name after the first Iraq invasion to avoid confrontation from others. House figures out that he and Samantha have familial Mediterranean fever, a genetic condition which caused all their symptoms: anhedonia, vasculitis, lactose intolerance, hematidrosis, and kidney failure. After the father and daughter are treated, they are shown smiling, playing and laughing together happily, in stark contrast to their earlier emotionlessness. Even as he awakes he notices beauty and color contrast to the grey of e.g. the empty room before.
While visiting Becca in her room, Cuddy is told by Becca that she had an epiphany while Joy was being born, and saw the sheer bliss on Cuddy's face when she held Joy, calling it "the most beautiful thing I've ever seen". Becca regretfully says she will not put the baby up for adoption. Cuddy is shocked and tries to reason with her but is unsuccessful. Seeing the finality of Becca's decision, Cuddy leaves, heartbroken. Later that night, House visits a devastated Cuddy at her newly furnished house (in preparation for the baby) and when Cuddy tells him she is finished with trying to have a child, whether through pregnancy or adoption, House says that it's "too bad" because she "would have made a great mother". Cuddy is shocked at first, then becomes angry and demands why House always negates every situation because he was the one who had said that she would "suck" as a mother ("Finding Judas"), yet now he is suddenly saying she would be a great mother. House looks at her regretfully and quietly responds that he does not know why. Cuddy's expression changes and then, in that tense moment, House and Cuddy passionately kiss, and the episode ends with a cliffhanger as House quietly says "good night" and walks out the door with Cuddy staring after him, saying a confused "good night".
Title.
The Episode Title 'Joy' refers directly to the name of the baby that Cuddy intends to adopt. It also relates to the diagnosed condition suffered by the patient and his daughter who while ill are incapable of feeling any pleasure.
