Loening Model 23

__NOTOC__
The Loening S-1 Flying Yacht, also called the Loening Model 23, was an early light monoplane seaplane designed in the United States by Grover Loening in the early 1920s. The aircraft won the 1921 Collier Trophy.
Design and development.
It was a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with the engine mounted pusher-fashion in a nacelle atop the wing. The cabin was semi-enclosed, featuring side windows but no roof, and was located immediately ahead of the wing. Twin tails were fitted, carrying a common stabiliser in a high position. The construction was unusual, in that rather than the flying boat hull being integral with the fuselage, the Model 23's hull was a large, separate pontoon mounted directly underneath a fuselage that was a separate structure. This was intended to combine the safety of the a floatplane design with the low parasitic drag of a conventional flying boat Grover Loening was awarded the 1921 Aero Club of America Trophy for the design. The fuel tank was located under the rear passenger seat. The prototype was tested with a new roll-control mechanism to replace ailerons using a small leading edge that extended and retracted outboard of the wing tips.
Operational history.
The S-1 was the second seaplane in monoplane configuration ever to go into production. It was one of the fastest seaplanes in production in 1921. The S-1 set a world seaplane record of in 1921 winning the Collier trophy for the year. A S-1 set a world record for altitude with four passengers flying to a height of over Long Island, New York in August 1921.
Three of the Air Yachts were purchased by the New York-Newport Air Service, and nine by the United States Army Air Service which operated them under the designation S-1. 
On a test-flight on 16 August 1921, an Air Yacht piloted by David McCullock reached an altitude of 19,500 ft (5,900 m) carrying three passengers (Grover Loening, Leroy Grumman, and Ladislas d'Orcy) in what was believed to be a record at the time. On 7 November 1924, Victor E. Bertrandias set a world airspeed record for a seaplane over a 1000-km course, with a speed of 103 mph (164 km/h) in an Army S-1.

Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and New Zealand

The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and New Zealand was an Archdiocese of the Greek Orthodox Church in Australia and New Zealand, part of the Eastern Orthodox religion. It was a jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The archdiocese was split in 1970 to form the 'Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia' and the 'Metropolis of New Zealand'
History.
In March 1924, the 'Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand' was established under the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The first Metropolitan of the new province of the Ecumenical Thronos was Christoforos Knitis of Serres, who presided from 1924-1928. He was succeeded by Metropolitan Timotheos Evangelinidis from 1931 to 1947, Metropolitan Theophylactos Papathanasopoulos from 1947 to 1958 and Metropolitan Ezekiel Tsoukalas from 1959.
The "Metropolis of Australia and New Zealand" was elevated to an Archdiocese in 1959 and Metropolitan Ezekiel was elevated to Archbishop. In 1970, Ecumenical Patriarchate split the archdiocese into the "Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia" and the "Metropolis of New Zealand". Archbishop Ezekiel remained as hierarch of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia until 1974, when he was succeeded by Stylianos Harkianakis.

Timmons &amp; Company

Timmons & Company is an American lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C.. After William Timmons left the Ford White House in 1975, he founded this company along with Tom Korologos, who had reported to Timmons as Nixon's White House legislative liaison. 
Nicknamed the "Rain Maker" for his aptitude to spur change on Capitol Hill, Timmons has used his clout in a scrupulous fashion. It was reported in 1982 that throughout his years of work in Washington, Timmons had given an honorable name to lobbying.
Business aspects.
The company has been described as ranking among the twenty most lucrative lobbying firms, with reported earnings of around $65 million since the start of public disclosures in 1998. Also described as small but influential and bipartisan, it has founders and clients from both sides of the political spectrum including company president Larry Harlow; a veteran of the Reagan and first Bush administrations and company vice president Dan Shapiro, a senior policy advisor for the Obama campaign.
According to a 2007 article in "The Politico", Timmons and Company used a unique business model to build their small, but influential firm:
Timmons & Co. caps its client roster and bills them all the same fee – with quarterly payments due in advance. It shuns big-name recruits, such as former senators and governors. It has never had a foreign client, and it has always been bipartisan. And, unlike many big firms, Timmons does not assign lobbyists to specific client accounts. Rather, they all work for all of their clients.
Clients.
Northrop Corporation retained Timmons and Company to work on the sale of the F-18 fighter jet to Congress.
In 1979, Chrysler Corporation hired lobbyist Tommy Boggs to influence Democrats, and Timmons, "a man skilled in gaining Republican sympathy for corporate causes," in their work to secure government loan guarantees.
Timmons and seven employees of Timmons and Company were listed as lobbyists for Bristol-Myers Squibb with "revolving door" connections to government in 2001 by Public Citizen; they listed the same eight in 2002 and 2003.
With eight lobbyists and about 20 clients in 2007 the firm includes clients such as the American Petroleum Institute, Daimler AG and Union Pacific Corporation, which have been clients of the firm for close to three decades.
In 2008, Timmons and Company was reported to have represented organizations such as the American Petroleum Institute, the American Medical Association, Chrysler, Visa USA, Anheuser-Busch, and Freddie Mac.
Political mention.
In 2008, the Obama campaign referred to Timmons as "one of Washington’s most famous and powerful lobbyists" when Timmons was tapped for planning help by the McCain campaign. "Time Magazine" reported that Timmons's lobbying registrations "include work on a number of issues that have become flashpoints in the presidential campaign. He has registered to work on bills that deal with the regulations of troubled mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, a bill to provide farm subsidies and bills that regulate domestic oil-drilling."
The Obama campaign hired Daniel Shapiro of this company as "senior adviser and Jewish outreach coordinator" in August 2008 after he "deregistered" as a lobbyist on 11 August. Prior to his deregistration, he served Obama as an "unpaid advisor."

Salt Lake City Saints

The Salt Lake City Saints are a basketball team in the American Basketball Association set to begin play in 2008-09. The Saints are owned by Kenny Wamsley, who was previously owner to the failed ABA expansion team the Salt Lake Dream. Home games for the team are played at the Lifetime Activities Center on the Taylorsville campus of Salt Lake Community College),
History.
The Saints are the fourth minor league basketball team to attempt to establish a team in Salt Lake County and the second ABA franchise in the area. They were preceded by the Utah Snowbears, who were 2004–05 ABA Championship contenders in their first season before folding the same year during the postseason. Wamsley followed with an abortive attempt to start up the Dream a couple of years later. Utah Eagles (a CBA team) did not fare well either and folded midway through their first CBA season.
One factor behind previous struggles in establishing a viable minor-league basketball franchise in Salt Lake County is the proximity of the NBA's Utah Jazz and the NBA Development League's Utah Flash. Talent levels in the ABA are decidedly lower than that of the NBA and the D-League, which negatively impacts fan interest. Establishing a fan base and revenue apart from the Jazz and the Flash is also difficult because the ABA regular season runs concurrently with the regular seasons in the NBA and D-League.
SLC named Lossie Mitchell as its head coach for the 2008–09 season. Derrick Pearson was named team president. Pearson previously worked in a similar capacity with the Snowbears and the Eagles. The initial Saints roster featured several players with ties to the state of Utah including John Millsap, brother of Utah Jazz forward Paul Millsap, and ex-University of Utah point guard Tim Drisdom along with former Utah State guards Myron Simms and Bernard Rock.
2008-09 season.
SLC's home opener was originally scheduled for December 3, 2008 against the Gallup Talons. No score has been reported for that game or three other subsequent home games listed for December, 2008 on the ABA website. The Saints have played only two road games so far, according to the league website. Both were road victories over the Modesto Bearcats.
Name Origins.
The team name is a reference to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), which is headquartered in Salt Lake City and is the religion of 58% of Utah's adult population.

Influenza A virus subtype H2N3

H2N3 is a subtype of the influenza A virus. Its name derives from the forms of the two kinds of proteins on the surface of its coat, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). H2N3 viruses can infect birds and mammals.
Overview.
According to research published by the US National Institutes of Health, the triple reassortant H2N3 virus isolated from diseased pigs in the United States in 2006 is pathogenic for certain mammals without prior adaptation and transmits among swine and ferrets. Adaptation, in the H2 hemagglutinin derived from an avian virus, includes the ability to bind to the mammalian receptor, a significant prerequisite for infection of mammals, in particular humans, which poses a big concern for public health. Researchers investigated the pathogenic potential of swine H2N3 in Cynomolgus macaques, a surrogate model for human influenza infection. In contrast to human H2N2 virus, which served as a control and largely caused mild pneumonia similar to seasonal influenza A viruses, the swine H2N3 virus was more pathogenic causing severe pneumonia in nonhuman primates. Both viruses replicated in the entire respiratory tract, but only swine H2N3 could be isolated from lung tissue on day 6 post infection. All animals cleared the infection whereas swine H2N3 infected macaques still presented with pathologic changes indicative of chronic pneumonia at day 14 post infection. Swine H2N3 virus was also detected to significantly higher titers in nasal and oral swabs indicating the potential for animal-to-animal transmission. Blood plasma levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and Interferon-gamma were significantly increased in swine H2N3 compared to human H2N2 infected animals supporting the previously published notion of increased IL-6 levels being a potential marker for severe influenza infections. Researchers concluded the swine H2N3 virus represents a threat to humans with the potential for causing a larger outbreak in a non-immune or partially immune population. Furthermore, surveillance efforts in farmed pig populations need to become an integral part of any epidemic and pandemic influenza preparedness.

Quicksilver initiatives

Quicksilver Initiatives is a term coined by the Bush administration in "The President’s Management Agenda" between the years 2001 and 2002. President Bush’s agenda was characterized by its presenting of fourteen different “areas of improvement” in federal government. The fourth of those areas was labeled “Expanded Electronic Government” and it was with regards to President Bush Administration’s intended transformation in e-governance. The quicksilver initiatives “marked the beginning of the era of full-scale e-government at the federal level.”
President Bush presented the quicksilver initiatives as a strategy to reach his administration’s goal of providing a larger number of services to a greater number of people at lower costs via electronic means. This process of transformation sought to shift the attention of governmental information technology from providing services within and among agencies to providing services to the public. It is, making “networks rather than agencies become primary” as it relates to public services. 
As a first step, the Clinton administration’s concept of e-government was adopted by President Bush’s government. It re-recreated, developed and implemented the existing FirstGov initiative along with a group of other twenty four projects that constitute the now so-called quicksilver initiatives.

Warnings Moving Clockwise

"Warnings Moving Clockwise" is the third single by Australian rock/pop group Do-Re-Mi released by Virgin Records in December 1985 from their "Domestic Harmony" album. All three tracks were written by lead vocalist Deborah Conway, drummerDorland Bray, bass guitarist Helen Carter and guitarist Stephen Philip. First single "Man Overboard" had been a surprise top 5 hit, but "Warnings Moving Clockwise", which was also produced and engineered by Gavin McKillop, did not have any chart success. When "Man Overboard" was released as a single in UK in 1986, the B-side was "Warnings Moving Clockwise".
Background.
Do-Ré-Mi had formed in Sydney in 1981 when Deborah Conway (lead vocals) and Dorland Bray (drums, percussion, backing vocals), both previously in Melbourne-based group The Benders, joined Helen Carter (bass, backing vocals) ex-Friction. Stephen Philip (guitar), ex-Thought Criminals, was initially a studio musician for their debut EP, "Do-Ré-Mi" released in August 1982 and was asked to join formally. They returned to the studio almost immediately and recorded "The Waiting Room" EP which was released in January 1983. "Man Overboard" was released as a single in June 1985, from "Domestic Harmony" on Virgin Records, and peaked at #5 on the Australian singles charts. The follow-up single from the same album, "Idiot Grin", was less successful than "Man Overboard" peaking at #43, and "Warnings Moving Clockwise" had even less chart success.

Mohican-Memorial State Forest

Mohican-Memorial State Forest is a state forest in Ashland County, Ohio, United States. Mohican-Memorial State Forest is used for forest research, demonstrations of good forest management, tree seed for nurseries, recreation, and protection of soil and watershed. The forest offers beautiful scenery which makes a great experience while hiking, biking, and canoeing.
Forest Description.
Mohican-Memorial State Forest comprises 4,525 acres and is carefully watched over by the Ohio Division of Natural Resources (ODNR). Mohican-Memorial State Forest is at the heart of “Mohican Country”, the third most popular tourist destination in the state. The ODNR Division of Forestry manages the forest under a multiple-use basis. Recreation, forest protection (insect, disease, regeneration and fire), wildlife management, law enforcement, soil and watershed management, and forest management for timber and non-timber are practiced. The Clear Fork River and Pine Run are the major streams that run through Mohican-Memorial State Forest. These streams then merge to make the large Mohican River. The forest has many types of trees like oak, hickory, cherry, white and red pine, maple, aspen, and other types of trees. Many species of animals thrive in Mohican-Memorial State Forest. Deer and turkey have been successfully reintroduced. Grouse and pheasant are occasionally seen. Fox, coyote, raccoon, skunk, rabbit, red and gray squirrel, amphibians, black snakes, owl, heron, and bald eagle are among the many species reported.
History of the State Forest.
The Ohio Division of Forestry first acquired the land in 1928 and has continued with the accumulation of over 4,500 acres. Some of the land acquired was deforested for agricultural use. The land had become eroded and unfertile, and it was eventually abandoned. When the land was acquired, it was a goal to reforest the land as quick as possible. Much work was done by the Civilian Conservation Corps who planted many trees during the 1930s. Their camp was located in the State Forest. They replanted approximately two million native hardwood trees like oak, hickory, beech, maple, and other trees like gum, aspen, ash, cherry, and walnut trees. Native pine trees are also found in the forest. The Corps also built roads, bridges, fire breaks, trails, picnic shelters, and two fire towers. 
Also found within Mohican-Memorial State Forest is the Memorial Forest Shrine Park. This is a 270 acre part of the Forest dedicated to 20,000 Ohio men and women who lost their lives in battle. In the Memorial Forest Shrine Park there is a chapel-like shrine that has the 20,000 names of the Ohio soldiers who lost their lives in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War.

Protorothyris

Protorothyris is an extinct genus of Early Permian protorothyridid known from Texas and West Virginia of the United States. It was first named by Llewellyn Ivor Price in 1937 and the type species is "Protorothyris archeri". "P. archeri" is known from the holotype MCZ 1532, a three-dimensionally preserved skull and from the referred specimens, which come from four additional individuals, MCZ 2147-2150. All specimens were collected in the Cottonwood Creek site, from the Archer City Formation, Texas, dating to the Asselian stage of the Cisuralian epoch, about 299-294.6 million years ago. A second species, "P. morani", was first named by Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1952 with its own generic name, "Melanothyris". In 1973, J. Clark and Robert L. Carroll recombined "P. morani" as a "Protorothyris" species. It is known from the holotype CM 8617, a three-dimensionally preserved skull. It was collected in the Blacksville site, from the Washington Formation (Asselian stage) of West Virginia. "Protorothyris" was the size of a lizard, about 30 cm in length.

Pesticides in New Zealand

There is a high use of pesticides in New Zealand due predominantly to the large agricultural industry.
Pesticides.
1080.
Sodium fluoroacetate, commonly known as 1080, is used in new Zealand to control animal pests, specifically the possum which threatens biodiversity and carries tuberculosus. Hunters fear that 1080 impacts on game animals, and some environmentalists have concerns about long term influences on drinking water.
2,4,5-T.
The manufacture of 2,4,5-T in New Zealand ceased in 1987 and is no longer sold in New Zealand.
2,4-D.
2,4-D is still used in New Zealand and the Pesticides Board has decided not to prohibit the use of the chemical.
DDT.
DDT was used extensively for agricultural use in the 1950s and 1960s to control grass grub and porina moth. It was also used on lawns and for market gardens. Some 500 tons was being applied annually by 1959. By the 1970s its use was restricted and it was finally banned in 1989. Residues are still found in livestock and in marine mammals.
Endosulfan.
The Auckland City Council stopped using endosulfan in the mid 1990s and its use was banned by the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) in December 2008 after a concerted campaign by environmental groups and the Green Party.
The non-approved use of endosulfan on cattle in 2007 led to the prosecution of a farmer and the halt of beef exports to Korea.
Testing as part of the Food Residues Surveillance Programme detects endosulfan in foods such as lettuce, strawberries and capsicum but are under 0.1 mg/kg.
In June 2008 the ERMA called for public submissions on the use of endosulfan after tighter controls had been placed on the pesticide in other countries. Submissions closed on 8 September 2008 and a total of 187 submissions were received.
The Green Party surveyed the 85 councils in New Zealand and discovered that 18 of them had used endosulfan on sports grounds in the year preceding October 2008. They claimed that New Zealand is the only country to do so and advocated for a ban on the use of endosulfan.
ERMA placed a ban on endosulfan effective from 16 January 2009.
Methyl bromide.
Methyl bromide is used as a fumigant for whole logs destined for export. There has been lobbying carried out recently to stop its use due to concerns for human health.
Pesticide residue.
Pesticide residues are generally low and are thought to pose no detectable threat to health. The Soil & Health Association of New Zealand and the Pesticide Action Network Aotearoa New Zealand claim that the 2010 results for pesticide residue are the worst ever.
Aerial spraying programmes.
Aerial spraying of West Auckland areas was carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) to eliminate the invasive painted apple moth, a potential threat to the environment and economy. Foray 48B was sprayed over populated West Auckland areas for 29 months involving 48 discrete spray events over 70 days. After the government declined to conduct a public inquiry into the spraying, a "people's inquiry" initiated by a number of academics delivered a report critical of MAF's approach to the issue.
Rural and city areas of Hamilton were sprayed to eradicate the gypsy moth.

Nola Ochs

Nola (Hill) Ochs (born November 22, 1911) is an American college graduate. On May 14, 2007 she became a Guinness World Record holder as the world's oldest college graduate when she received her diploma at Fort Hays State University (FHSU) in Hays, Kansas. She earned a general studies degree with an emphasis in history, graduating alongside her granddaughter, Alexandra Ochs, who was 21 years old at the time. 
A native of Jetmore, Kansas, Ochs was born in 1911 and took her first college class from FHSU in 1930 when the university was called the Kansas State College. Nola and her husband, Vernon Ochs, raised four sons (who have given her 13 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren) on the family farm. She took college courses again from Dodge City Community College in Dodge City, Kansas after her husband of 39 years died in 1972. After learning that she was only 30 hours shy of a bachelor’s degree, Nola moved 100 miles from the family farm to an FHSU university apartment in Hays to finish her degree. During her first year at Fort Hays, Ochs told news reporters that after she graduated, she wanted to be a storyteller on a cruise ship. 
Among her accomplishments, Ochs was named the 2007 Kansas Woman Leader of the Year and was given her diploma by Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius. Features on Ochs aired on "The Early Show", MSNBC, and CBS News among others. She even earned a spot on "The Tonight Show" one week after she graduated, sharing a laugh with Jay Leno. 
After graduation, Princess Cruises hired her as a guest lecturer on a nine-day Caribbean cruise. She shared the adventure with her granddaughter, Alexandra. After taking time to help with the family wheat harvest, Ochs started pursuing her master’s degree in liberal studies from Fort Hays State University in August 2007. She received her master's on May 15, 2010, making her the oldest recipient of a master's degree at age 98. According to an August 11, 2006 press release from FHSU, Ochs said “I don't keep track of my age, but I can tell you I was born in November of 1911.” She also commented, “I've led a long, interesting life. We went through the dust storms. We had some difficult times in our marriage, financially. But it's been the Lord's will that I've lived this long life, and I thank Him kindly for it.” As of her 100th birthday in November 2011 she was an M.A Student at FHSU and a Graduate Teaching Assistant.

Siege of Sambhal

Background.
Babur and his army were strangers to the people whom he had subdued in India and a mutual dislike soon manifested itself between his soldiers and the inhabitants of Agra his head quarters. The invasion was regarded as a temporary inundation that would speedily pass off. Every man in authority raised troops and put himself in a condition to act. Those who held delegated authority or "Jagirs" being generally Afghans were consequently hostile to the new state of things. They soon came to an understanding among themselves and took measures for mutual cooperation.
Western Afghan Confederates and Allies.
Hasan Khan of Mewat in the neighborhood of Agra was the grand instigator of the opposition which was supported by Nizam Khan in Biana; Muhammad Zaitoon of Dholpur; Tatar Khan Sarang khani in Gwalior; Hussein Khan Lohani in Raberi; Kutb Khan in Etawah; Alim Khan Jilal Khan Jighat in Kalpi; Kasim Sambhali in Sambhal and Marghoob a slave in Mahawan within 20 km of Agra. Indeed all of these chiefs were immediately around Agra or close upon its borders. They looked for aid from Maharana Sangram Singh better known as Rana Sanga, the ruler of Mewar, who on his part laid claim to a great part of the right bank of the Yamuna River including Delhi. These Western Afghans wished to place Sultan Mahmud Lodi a brother of the late Sultan Ibrahim Lodi on the throne of Delhi and so to preserve the Afghan and the Lodi dynasty.
Siege.
Babur's first active operation in the field was to dispatch a force to the relief of Sambhal a district lying beyond the Ganges in what is now called Rohilkhand. It was held by Kasim Sambhali who had formerly shown himself hostile to Babur but was glad to solicit his aid when at this time besieged in his chief town by Malik Baban Jilwani. This powerful and active Pathan chief had joined Babur after he had passed Sirhind but subsequently left him under circumstances which are not clear, but he probably was not satisfied with his reception as Babur complains with bitterness of his presumption and pretensions and of the rudeness and stupid forwardness of the Pathans in general. However that may be, Baban had withdrawn himself from Babur's camp had collected an army and now besieged Kasim in Sambhal which he had discovered was ill garrisoned. Kasim reduced to the last extremity applied to Babur for assistance. The Emperor dispatched Hindu Baig with a body of Turks-Mughals along with Sheikh Kuren and his Doab Turkishbunds to his succor.
Hindu Baig marched with all possible expedition till he reached the Ganges and while busily employed in conveying his other troops across that river sent on in advance a Mughal officer with a body of his countrymen. Though the party did not exceed a 150 men, they rode forward till they reached the town and such was the superiority which the invaders from the north had acquired over the troops of the country that the Mughals had no sooner got between the town and the besiegers than they resolutely turned and charged them though already the alarm had been given and Baban had had time to draw out his force. The attack was so vigorous and probably the panic produced by the expected approach of the rest of the detachment so great that Baban's whole army was routed and dispersed several elephants taken and many slaughtered. Next day Hindu Baig arrived with the rest of the troops and had an interview with Kasim Sambhali who made some difficulty about giving up the place. He was soon however seized by stratagem and the fort itself taken possession of. His family and followers were allowed to retire to Bayana.
Aftermath.
Babur's success did not end here. The fortress of Raberi on the Yamuna was soon after abandoned by its garrison and occupied by his troops and he sent detachments to besiege Etawah and Dholpur two places of the greatest importance from their vicinity to Agra. But these initial victories brought him in direct conflict with the Western and Eastern Afghan confederates at once. Babur then sent an army under his son Humayun who would put to flight the army of the Eastern confederates and take Jaunpur, Oudh, Kalpi.
Meanwhile the Western Afghan confederates were being gradually swallowed up by Rajput Rana Sanga in the guise of alliance and protection. This was increasingly posing as a major threat to Babur. He was justly alarmed at the progress of Rana Sanga who was in active correspondence with Hasan Khan of Mewat the chief of the Afghan confederacy of the West and had acknowledged as Sultan of Delhi, Mahmud Lodi, the brother of the late Sultan Ibrahim Lodi whom the western Afghans had proclaimed King after his brother's death. This would ultimately result in the confrontation known as the Battle of Khanwa.

The main tomb building is enclosed by delicate marble screens on all sides, and the tomb is located in the centre of the main hall, which has a single semi-circular dome. The marble building is beautifully carved, and has an ivory-like appearance. The plinth is ornamented with mosaics of black and yellow marble arranged in geometric patterns. An ebony “chhaparkhat” enclosure surrounds the marble cenotaph, which is usually covered by a green cloth. A wooden canopy incrusted with mother-of-pearl inlay mosaic over it.
The door to the main chamber is intricately carved with arabesque patterns and bears inscriptions from the Koran. Brown marble borders the interior bays while the relief panels - with the Koranic verses - have a blue background. The carved and painted tomb chamber has a white marble floor, which is inlaid with multicolored stones.
Belief.
Devotees ask for the blessings of the saint and seek fulfillment of their wishes. It is believed that tying a thread on the marble screens of the main tomb building serves as a constant reminder to the saint of their wishes.

Dick's Hotel

Dick's Hotel was built in 1872 on the corner of Beattie and Montague Streets Balmain, an inner-west suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Built by John Dick, local publican of note, it was known as Lean's Hotel from 1886 to 1898 when owned by Jabez Lean, but reverted to its former name after and has remained as such since. 
Associated with the political movements of the late nineteenth century, especially the growing labour movement, it was also the scene for farewells to contingents from NSW to the Boxer Rebellion and the Boer War. The hotel did not suffer unduly from Darling Street overtaking Beattie Street as the main thoroughfare of the suburb with the introduction of tramways, but rather grew through its rivalry with the three-story Exchange Hotel opposite, built 1886.
Both hotels enjoy a lively competition to this day.

Snap (computer graphics)

In computer graphics, snapping allows an object to be easily positioned in alignment with grid lines, guide lines or another object, by causing it to automatically jump to an exact position when the user drags it to the proximity of the desired location.
Some CAD software provides a "Snap" pull-down menu with diverse options as preferences for the practice of the operation.
In Windows with the option snap enabled, vertical positioning of a window against the top edge of the screen causes it to change into full screen.

St John Youth New Zealand

St John Youth in New Zealand is a cadet-based programme designed for children and young people aged between 6 and 18. Members who turn 18 tend to remain in St John Youth in leadership roles.
St John Youth is closely affiliated with the Order of St John in New Zealand, of which Her Excellency the Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign head.
St John Youth is divided into two programmes. There is the Penguin Programme for children aged between 6 and 8, while the Cadet Programme for young people aged from 8 to 18.
While the basis for St John Youth is first aid, other topics like drill (marching), healthcare and leadership make up major parts of the St John Youth programme.
Regions.
St John Youth is divided into three regions around New Zealand, each of which have a Regional Youth Manager.
They are:
Grand Prior Award Scheme.
The Grand Prior Award Scheme is often considered to be the highest achievement available for St John Youth members.
Badges are split into three levels - Green, Blue and Gold. In order to earn the Grand Prior, a cadet must achieve the 6 compulsory badges plus 6 other optional badges, all at Gold level.
The badges available are: (note badges with an * beside them indicates a compulsory badge)
Competitions.
Competitions are held regularly throughout the year, with tests on Basic Life Support, Caregivers, Communication, Drill and First Aid
Divisions can enter teams of up to two competitors for Penguin (6-8 year olds) and Junior (9-10 year olds) competitions, and there are four team members in Intermediate (11-12 year olds) and two team members in Senior (13-18 year olds) teams.
Many Regions run District Competitions, and winners of those competitions go forward to Regional Competitions, however Central Region is a region that does not hold formal District Competitions - instead any Division may enter teams straight into the Regional Competitions.
Both North Island regions compete annually at Interprovincial Competitions. To qualify to go to Interprovincial's your team needs to gain a 1st, 2nd or 3rd placing in the Senior Team Quiz test at Regional competitions (in Central Region only) or get a placing for the Hutchinson Cup (in Northern Region only)to be able to go to Interprovincial's. Additionally, both regions send 5 teams to Interprovincial's the first 4 from either the Quiz tes or Hutchinson Cup and the other team is selected at regional discretion by the Regional Youth Manager or their nominee.
National Youth Festival.
The National Youth Festival is held every year in a different region. This is a competition where all regions from around New Zealand meet for competitions which are often held in June.
In 2012, the National Youth Festival was held in Queenstown during the April school holidays. All regions run a process to select their squads that will represent their Region at competitions. Each Region has a different process and must select four teams of four, four individuals and four emergencys, although some Regions select development squads that don't compete on the day but train with the squad, or as a non competing emergency.
The National Youth Festival is often considered the highest honour in competing with St John Youth.
The current holder of the Champion Region honour is South Island Region, who won the award in 2013 after winning the majority of tests during the competitions.
The Champion Individual title is currently held by Eunice Ng of Northern Region. 
International Youth Festival.
In 2010 New Zealand hosted an International Youth Festival. Held between the 25th and 31 January at Lincoln University near Christchurch. Cadets from 8 other countries, such as England, Wales, Germany, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia attended the festival, which incorporated both the National and International competitions. The Northern Region South Island team won the National Competitions, winning Champion Team, Champion Individual and Champion Region, amongst other trophies. Other activities during the festival included an 'Amazing Puzzle Race' around Christchurch city center, a visit to Hamner Springs and Thrillseekers canyon, a Youth Symposium, in which cadets listened to speakers and discussed issues faced Youth in today's world, a sports championship, surfing and Sightseeing around Christchurch City and the International Antarctic Center.
Every 4 years an international Youth Festival is held. The last international youth festival was held in Christchurch New Zealand in January 2010. Sydney Australia is set to host the next International Youth Festival in 2014.
Divisions.
Each region in St John Youth is made up of "Divisions" in which cadets meet. Divisions usually meet for an hour and a half and once a week. Each Division has a Divisional Manager and many have Assistant Divisional Managers as well.
In New Zealand, the first cadet division was started on 2 May 1927 by Mr Ted Gilberd in Whanganui.
Cadet of the Year.
Each region elects a Cadet of the Year who will represent their region in events around the country. After all the Cadet of the Year cadets are chosen, then a National Cadet selection is held, every other year, a think tank is held in conjunction with the selection process.
Child and Youth Protection Policy.
St John Youth has a nation-wide Child and Youth Protection Policy (CYPP) which ensures the safety of its cadets. The policy includes a rule which means that no cadet can be with a leader (any St John member over the age of 18) on their own.
The CYPP also details the Youth to Adult ratio, which aims to ensure that there are enough Adults to care for the Youth members.
Joining St John Youth.
Those who which to join St John Youth can contact a Division in their area and then attend a Divisional Meeting. It costs NZ$40.00 per year, plus additional fees for attending events, such as competitions or camps. The sew-on proficiency badges, certificates and badge material are included in the annual fee. For those facing financial hardship, St John has funds available to meet costs in cases of financial hardship.

New Lincoln School

The New Lincoln School was a private experimental coeducational school in New York City enrolling students from kindergarten through grade 12.
History.
Its predecessor was founded as Lincoln School in 1917 by the Rockefeller-funded General Education Board as "a pioneer experimental school for newer educational methods," under the aegis of Columbia University's Teachers College. In 1941 Teachers College merged Lincoln School with Horace Mann School, which it operated as a demonstration school. When Teachers College closed down the combined school in 1946, parents of Lincoln School enrollees established the New Lincoln School in 1948 to carry on the tradition of progressive, experimental education, concentrating on the individual child, offering an interdisciplinary core program as well as electives in elementary grades, and emphasizing the arts.
In 1956, the school acquired the former Boardman School on East 82nd Street and moved its Lower School (through second grade) to that campus, under the coordination of Terry Spitalny.
In 1974, the school moved to 210 East 77th Street. The school merged with the Walden School in Fall 1988 to become the New Walden Lincoln School, which ultimately closed in Summer 1991.
Campus.
The New Lincoln School building had previously been the 110th Street Community Center. An eight-story building that had been recently renovated and had a swimming pool in the basement, it was further renovated to meet the new school's needs of a cafeteria, classrooms, laboratories, and a library.
Today, the West 110th Street site is home to the Lincoln Correctional Facility, a minimum-security work-release center. The East 77th Street campus has been occupied by the Birch Wathen School since 1989.
Curriculum.
The curriculum revolved around "Core," a theme around which social science and English instruction was structured. Field trips and class plays were integrated with Core. Core topics included the Dutch in New York, China, India, Japan, and American History. Some Core programs were linked to a grade, while others varied from year to year. Science and Math were taught more conventionally, though Math classes were smaller, broken down within groups by level. 
Instruction was highly individualized, with individual exploration and small work groups greatly encouraged. Seating plans were generally informal, and most teachers were called by their first names, though they could choose more formal modes of address. Foreign language instruction, French and Spanish, began in the fifth grade. English grammar was not taught. 
The arts were stressed. An extensive studio art program was headed by Lois Lord ("Lordy"), assisted later by Doris Stahl and others, explored many media. The ceramics program, which featured kilns and a wide range of glazing materials, was run by "Axie" Axelson. Music was taught by Hugh McElhenny. Hugh used a great variety of instruments in teaching, and students played on autoharps, temple blocks, marimbas, gongs, to mention a few. Song lyrics were displayed with a slide projector against the wall during group singing, and the range of music ranged from folk and work songs to Broadway tunes. All students, regardless of gender, took Wood Shop and Home Economics.
While grade levels were conventional, the Middle School combined fifth and sixth grades and seventh and eighth into two or three groups each. Grades were labeled alphabetically, so that Group A corresponded to first grade, Group B to second ... Groups K, L, M to seventh and eighth.
In popular culture.
A benefit concert for the school on April 19, 1959 at Carnegie Hall by Harry Belafonte was one of two such concerts recorded and released as "Belafonte at Carnegie Hall". The other benefit concert, for the Wiltwyck School on April 20, netted $58,000 for that school.

Anne Kerr, Lady Kerr

Anne Kerr, Lady Kerr (191416 September 1997) was the second wife of Sir John Kerr, Governor-General of Australia 1974-77. They were married during his term of office, six months after his first wife had died.
Biography.
Anne Dorothy Taggart was born in 1914. She was known as Nancy to her friends. She was an honours graduate from the University of Sydney. In 1935 she was awarded a French Government travelling scholarship and gained her Master of Arts from the Sorbonne, Paris. She appeared as an official French-English interpreter at more than 30 international conferences over ten years, including Colombo Plan meetings. On one occasion she interpreted for Jawaharlal Nehru at a United Nations human rights seminar in New Delhi. She was also fluent in German.
In 1941 she married Hugh Walker Robson QC, a barrister, who was appointed to the bench in 1970. He was Judge of the New South Wales District Court and Chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions. They had a son and a daughter. At one time he had made a bid for Liberal Party preselection for the federal seat of Warringah.
After the end of World War II, she acted as an interpreter for the Department of External Affairs for visiting French delegations.
In 1966 she was the first Australian to become a member of the International Association of Conference Interpreters.
Her marriage to Robson was dissolved in early 1975. It was reported that "strings had been pulled" to ensure her quick divorce from Robson and an avoidance of publicity. Shortly afterwards, in the Scots Kirk, Mosman, she married the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, becoming the second Lady Kerr; Sir John was a widower, his first wife Allison (née Worstead) having died on 10 September 1974, two months after he took up the post at Yarralumla.
She was privy to her husband's thoughts and anxieties as the 1975 constitutional crisis developed, but in his autobiography "Matters for Judgement" (1978) Sir John Kerr strongly denied she had either dissuaded him from warning the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam that he was going to dismiss him, or that she herself had a political axe to grind. The Kerrs moved to England in 1977 after the widespread public criticism of his acceptance of the ambassadorship to UNESCO, a post he was forced to relinquish before taking it up.
Her memoirs, "Lanterns Over Pinchgut", describe her extensive international experience.
Lady Kerr died in 1997 after a long battle with cancer. She was survived by her two children and four grandchildren.

UNA (band)

Downtempo Electronic trio UNA formed in 2006 around the edges of another LA trio, Elephonic, sharing members Jennifer Nice and Eddie Barajas. Producer Richard Larsen recorded a demo for Jennifer, and, after hearing her Latin soul vibe, started working on the EP The Rain is Over and Gone in late 2006. Soon Eddie B joined them and a full length release, entitled "one", followed shortly in mid-2007. Several songs were favored by influential radio station KCRW (home of Morning Becomes Eclectic with Nic Harcourt) and swept the LP to the top position, debuting at #1 in the US for unsigned bands in late 2007 (Mediaguide, ASCAP).
Using mostly downtempo jazz inspired grooves and Wurli electric piano, UNA proceeds to deliver profound pop with turntabalism, lending their vibe to what is called electronica but would otherwise be described as a new form arising from the aftermath of giants Portishead and Massive Attack. While not re-hashing those ideas yet remaining openly positive and spirited, UNA is moving into new territory with musical references to 50's sci-fi, exotica, soundtracks, and classical music.

In Our Style is an album by David Murray and Jack DeJohnette released on the Japanese DIW label. It was released in 1986 and features five duo performances by Murray and DeJohnette with Fred Hopkins joining on two additional numbers.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars stating "David Murray, doubling on tenor and bass clarinet, interacts with drummer Jack Dejohnette and (on two of the seven selections) bassist Fred Hopkins for a set of originals by Murray, DeJohnette and Butch Morris. The duo/trio explore a variety of moods with Murray's extroverted and advanced solos generally serving as the lead voice. Although an avant-garde set, this Japanese import has its mellow and melodic moments before the fire takes over again.".

USS Comfort (AH-6)

The second USS "Comfort" (AH-6) was launched 18 March 1943 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by First Lieutenant E. Hatchitt, USAMC; transferred to the Navy the same day; converted to a hospital ship by Bethlehem Steel Co., San Pedro, Calif.; and commissioned 5 May 1944 with Commander Harold Farnham Fultz in command.
History.
"Comfort" was one of three hospital ships, the others being and , built, commanded and crewed by the Navy for the Army. These ships, unlike the Navy hospital ships, were intended for evacuation and transport of patients after primary care had been given. Medical equipment and personnel were provided by the Army. The Army medical complement table of organization provided for the temporary reinforcement of the staff if the ship directly supported amphibious operations.
"Comfort" operated throughout World War II with a Navy crew and Army medical personnel. She sailed from San Pedro, 21 June 1944 for Brisbane, Australia, and Hollandia, New Guinea. Operating from Hollandia, where a major Army hospital center had been established to handle casualties from the Philippine operations, the hospital ship evacuated wounded from Leyte, Philippine Islands on two voyages in October and November and then brought patients back to San Pedro, Calif., in December. Returning by way of Leyte, "Comfort" reached Hollandia 6 February 1945. Following a voyage to Subic Bay and Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, for evacuees in March, the hospital ship stood by off Okinawa from 2 to 9 April, receiving wounded for evacuation to Guam. Returning to Okinawa 23 April, 6 days later she was struck by a Japanese suicide plane. The plane crashed through three decks exploding in surgery which was filled with medical personnel and patients. Casualties were 28 killed (including six nurses), and 48 wounded, with considerable damage to the ship. After temporary repairs at Guam "Comfort" sailed for Los Angeles, Calif., arriving 28 May.
"Comfort" arrived in Subic Bay 5 September 1945 and until 11 October served as station hospital ship. Following a voyage to Okinawa she sailed for home by way of Yokohama, Japan, and Guam, reaching San Pedro, Calif., 11 December. She made another voyage to Manila, Yokohama, Inchon, Korea, and Okinawa between 1 January and 4 March 1946 before being decommissioned at San Francisco 19 April 1946. She was transferred to the Army the same day.
"Comfort" received two battle stars for World War II service.
In pop culture.
The ship was mentioned in the "JAG" episode "Each of Us Angels" (episode 8.14) which aired 4 February 2003. This focused on the United States Navy Nurse Corps in World War II during the Battle of Iwo Jima.

Richard M. Goodwin

Richard M. Goodwin (February 24, 1913 – August 13, 1996) was an American mathematician and economist. He was born in New Castle, Indiana.
Background.
Goodwin received his BA and PhD at Harvard, and he taught there from 1942 until 1950. He taught at the University of Cambridge until 1979 and the University of Siena until 1984. He was the first non-Italian professor of economics at Siena. He described himself as "a lifelong but wayward Marxist", joining the Communist Party of Great Britain while a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford in the 1930s, and then its American counterpart when back he got back to the States. He left after the announcement of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.
Work.
Goodwin worked on the interaction between long run growth and business cycles. His article on "matrix multiplier" was one of the earliest uses of the Perron–Frobenius theorem in economics, although his reasoning had an error that was diagnosed by Frank H. Hahn. He returned to the Perron–Frobenius theorem with his book on "The dynamics of a capitalist economy".
Goodwin adopted the Lotka–Volterra equations for the population dynamics of a predator and prey species as a persistent model of economic growth, called the "Goodwin model" (or "Goodwin's Class-Struggle Model"). In his model, employed workers have the role of predators, as their wage demands squeeze profits and hence investment, leading to an increase in unemployment. Another model, "Goodwin's Non-Linear Accelerator", is also a model of endogenous cycles in economic activity; the cycles do not rely on outside shocks or structurally unstable parameters. "A Growth Cycle" (1967) saw Goodwin utilise Volterra's equations to formalise Marx's theory of economic cycles.

George Stanford

George Stanford (born May 8) is a Los Angeles-based singer and songwriter who was signed to Mercury Records. He is a former member and lead vocalist for the band Townhall.
Biography.
Growing up outside of Philadelphia, Stanford was surrounded by song. "Music was always there," Stanford says. His parents' love of classic country and bluegrass by such legendary artists as Ralph Stanley, Hank Williams and Merle Haggard taught him the value of taking the listener on an adventure through song. "I love hearing people tell a story. That's probably why I like old country records so much," he says. "Then with people like Paul Simon, there's the first listen where you hear the story and there are so many layers where you can go back and pick out so many lyrical or sonic elements every time."
Stanford first picked up a trombone—or as he calls it, his "gateway" instrument—when he was a kid. Bass, guitar and piano followed. His love for music led him to study at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. However, he ultimately abandoned his studies. "I realized that a degree in jazz performance really won't get you a hot cup of jack squat," he says with a laugh. "In examining all the artists that inspire me and get my blood pumping, like Bob Marley, I realized school wasn't necessarily a big part of where any of them came from. I decided the only way to really school myself in music is to play music."
But his schooling did provide one career path; he and several of his fellow students formed a band called Townhall. In their few years together, they became something of a regional sensation, playing in front of up to 2,000 people.
"I learned about being on the road and about the craft of songwriting and the craft of entertaining," he says of his days in "Townhall". "Even if it's just a six-inch platform, as soon as you step up on stage, just give them a show. When people buy a ticket, they want a piece of you in a sense and there's also something just in terms of respecting the tradition of all the great people who inspired me, like Tom Petty, who was the first artist I saw live."
Eventually, the members of "Townhall" grew apart and Stanford decided to go solo: "I found I was reaching people in a fundamentally deeper and more effective way when I would just play my songs with my guitar," he says.
Confirmation of that fact quickly came when, through a little help from a fellow Philadelphian, Stanford landed his record deal. Stanford wrote "Heartbeat," a tune also featured on "The EP," with the aforementioned Tozer, another Philly boy best known for his work with multi-platinum sensation John Legend.
The set opens with "My Own Worst Enemy," a mission statement of sorts about Stanford's relationship with an alternately loving and harsh mistress: music. "It's given me the greatest things. It's about the struggle of trying to make a life out of it," he says. "When I was struggling, I'd start to think about my options and I really couldn't think of any so it always came back to music for me."
The EP's emotional center is "Downriver," a stripped-down song highlighting his ringing guitar work that was recorded live at Los Angeles' taste-making Hotel Café shortly after his arrival in the City of Angels, where he currently lives.
"That's a real important song for me," he says. "It sums up that feeling of surrender, when I decided if I never make a dime from my music, I have to be okay with that because this is the path I've chosen. It was very liberating in a lot of ways. There's going to be rapids and obstacles, but the only way to reach the other side is to throw away your fears and go with the flow."

Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri

The Jama Masjid in Fatehpur Sikri is a mosque in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, completed in 1571-5 by Sheikh Salim Chishti.The Imam of the Mosque has been the late Hazrat Shah Muhammad Mazhar Ullah and now his son Maulvi Mukarram Ahmad leads the prayer.Being the mosque constructed by the Mughal Emperor,they are referred to as 'Shahi Imams' (Royal Imams)
Architecture.
The rectangular mosque comprises a central nave with a single dome, two colonnaded halls on either side, with two square chambers crowned with domes. Carved mihrabs adorn the main chamber and the two smaller rooms.
The mosque marks the phase of transition in Islamic art, as indigenous architectural elements were blended with Persian elements. The pillared dalan of the facade, the liwan with three arched openings framed by panels and crowned by five chhatris and the central mihrab adorned with an inlaid mosaic of stones that are bordered by glazed tiles, and it has golden inscriptions on a royal blue background, a tribute to this fusion. The interiors of the iwan are adorned with watercolour paintings depicting stylized floral designs. The dado panels, spandrels of arch and soffits are painted profusely. Unlike other monuments, where domes are supported on squinches, here corbelled pendentives support the dome.
The Buland Darwaza and the Tomb of Salim Chishti are also a part of the mosque complex.

All Saints Church, Peshawar

All Saints Church (built 1883), located inside the Kohati Gate of the old walled city of Peshawar in Pakistan, is a parish of the Church of Pakistan. It is an architecturally unique place of worship that bears a striking resemblance to an Islamic saracenic mosque with minarets and a dome.
The Church was opened on St. John's Day, 27 December 1883. The foundation stone was laid by Captain Graves whose widow presented the brass desk on the Lord's Table. A plaque on a wall records: "This church is erected to the Glory of God and dedicated to the memory of All Saints in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ 1883."
2013 attack by terrorists.
On September 22, 2013, two suicide bombers carried out an attack outside of the church at the end of a Sunday service, killing 127 people and injuring 170. 600 parishioners were on the front lawn of the church, receiving free food, when two explosions occurred, leaving the church scattered with body parts. Victims included an estimated 37 children. TTP Jundullah, linked to the Taliban, said it had carried out the attack on the Christian congregation, saying, "We will continue our attacks on non-Muslims on Pakistani land."
This is the second attack on churches in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in a year, where another church in Mardan was burnt exactly a year before this incident.

List of Solanum species

This is a list of species in the plant genus "Solanum". There may be up to approximately 1500 species worldwide. With some 800 accepted specific and infra-specific taxa of the more than 4,000 described, the genus "Solanum" contains more species than any other genus in the Solanaceae family and it is one of the largest among the angiosperms.
Phylogenetic analysis of molecular data has established or confirmed that the genera "Lycopersicon," "Cyphomandra," "Normania," and "Triguera", which were previously classified independently, should in reality be included within the "Solanum". In fact, all the species from these four genera have been formally transferred to "Solanum". On the other hand, the genus "Lycianthes", which is sometimes included within the "Solanum", has been shown to be a separate genus.
The following alphabetical list of "Solanum" species provides the binomial name followed by the name of the species authority, abbreviated according to the appropriate conventions and uses.
The tuberous species within the genus (those related to Solanum tuberosum, the potato, and therefore often called wild potatoes) have been indicated with the letter T. The nothospecies belonging to the genus appear at the end of the list, that is those taxa that have originated from a hybrid between two different species (for example, "Solanum × viirsooi", which has been shown to be an interspecific hybrid resulting from the cross between "S. acaule" and " S. infundibuliforme".)

Vysshaya Liga (ice hockey)

The Vysshaya Liga (, "Supreme League of the Russian Ice Hockey Championship"), also referred as Higher League or Major League and commonly abbreviated as RUS-2, was a second level professional ice hockey league in Russia.
Season structure.
The league consisted of two divisions (East and West) before 2008 and three divisions for the last two seasons. During 1997–2000 there was a relegation round where the strongest teams of the league played with the weakest RSL clubs for their place in the top division. In 2001–01 this system was replaced with a final round between the league teams only and starting with 2003–04 the Supreme League ultimately switched to playoffs. Its finalists were promoted to the RSL.
In 2008 when the Superleague became defunct the Supreme League that still was operating under the FHR authority got its own cup.
Establishment of the VHL.
In 2010 it became known that the Vysshaya Liga was to be replaced with the KHL–affiliated Higher Hockey League (VHL) under a new ownership. Most of the Vysshaya Liga clubs resign with a new league in summer of 2010.

<doc id="19785352" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19785352" title="Male breast cancer">
Male breast cancer

Male breast cancer (male breast neoplasm) is a relatively rare cancer in men that originates from the breast. As it presents a similar pathology as female breast cancer, assessment and treatment relies on experiences and guidelines that have been developed in female patients. The optimal treatment is currently not known.
Incidence.
About one percent of breast cancer develops in males. It is estimated that about 2,140 new cases are diagnosed annually in the United States(US) and about 300 in the United Kingdom(UK). The number of annual deaths in the US is about 450. In a study from India, eight out of 1,200 (0.7%) male cancer diagnoses in a pathology review represented breast cancer. Incidences of male breast cancer have been increasing which raise the probability of other family members developing the disease. The relative risk of breast cancer for a female with an affected brother is approximately 30% higher than for a female with an affected sister. The tumor can occur over a wide age range, but typically appears in men in their sixties and seventies. Known risk factors include radiation exposure, exposure to female hormones (estrogen), and genetic factors. High estrogen exposure may occur by medications, obesity, or liver disease, and genetic links include a high prevalence of female breast cancer in close relatives. Chronic alcoholism has been linked to male breast cancer. The highest risk for male breast cancer is carried by men with Klinefelter syndrome. Male BRCA mutation carriers are thought to be at higher risk for breast cancer as well, with roughly 10% of male breast cancer cases carrying BRCA2 mutations, and BRCA1 mutation being in the minority.
Pathology.
As in females, infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most common type. While intraductal cancer, inflammatory carcinoma, and Paget's disease of the nipple have been described, lobular carcinoma in situ has not been seen in men. Breast cancer in men spreads via lymphatics and blood stream like female breast cancer. Accordingly, the TNM staging system for breast cancer is the same for men and women.
Size of the lesion and lymph node involvement determine prognosis; thus small lesions without lymph node involvement have the best prognosis. Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status and HER2/neu (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) gene amplification need to be reported as they may affect treatment options. About 85% of all male breast cancers are estrogen receptor–positive, and 70% are progesterone receptor–positive.
Diagnosis.
Typically self-examination leads to the detection of a lump in the breast which requires further investigation. Other less common symptoms include nipple discharge, nipple retraction. swelling of the breast, or a skin lesion such as an ulcer. Ultrasound and mammography may be used for its further definition. The lump can be examined either by a needle biopsy where a thin needle is placed into the lump to extract some tissue or by an excisional biopsy where under local anesthesia a small skin cut is made and the lump is removed. Not all palpable lesions in the male breast are cancerous, for instance a biopsy may reveal a benign fibroadenoma. In a larger study from Finland the average size of a male breast cancer lesion was 1.8 cm. Beside the histologic examination estrogen and progesterone receptor studies are performed. Further, the HER2 test is used to check for a growth factor protein. Its activity can be increased in active cancer cells and helps determine if monoclonal antibody therapy (i.e. Trastuzumab) may be useful.
Male breast cancer can recur locally after therapy, or can become metastatic.
Staging.
In addition to TNM staging surgical staging for breast cancer is used; it is the same as in female breast cancer and facilitates treatment and analysis.
Stage IIA: One of the following applies:
T0 or T1, N1 (but not N1mi), M0: The tumor is 2 cm or less across (or is not found) (T1 or T0) and either:
It has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (N1a), but not to distant sites (M0), OR
Tiny amounts of cancer are found in internal mammary lymph nodes on sentinel lymph node biopsy (N1b), but not in distant sites (M0), OR.
It has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, and tiny amounts of cancer are found in internal mammary lymph nodes on sentinel lymph node biopsy (N1c), but not to distant sites (M0).
OR
T2, N0, M0: The tumor is larger than 2 cm across and less than 5 cm (T2), but it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes (N0) or to distant sites (M0).
Stage IIB: One of the following applies:
T2, N1, M0: The tumor is larger than 2 cm and less than 5 cm across (T2). It has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and/or tiny amounts of cancer are found in internal mammary lymph nodes on sentinel lymph node biopsy (N1). It has not spread to distant sites (M0).
OR
T3, N0, M0: The tumor is larger than 5 cm across but does not grow into the chest wall or skin (T3). It has not spread to lymph nodes (N0) or to distant sites (M0).
Differences from female breast cancer.
There are significant differences between male and female breast cancer. Lesions are easier to find in men due to the smaller breast size; however, lack of awareness may postpone seeking medical attention. The presence of gynecomastia may mask the condition. The diagnosis is made later in men—at age 67 on average—than in women with their average at 63. Lesions are less contained in men as they do not have to travel far to infiltrate skin, nipple, or muscle tissue. Thus, lesions in men tend to be more advanced. Indeed, almost half of male breast cancer patients are stage III or IV. In familial cases, male BRCA2 carriers are at risk, rather than BRCA1 carriers. With the relative infrequency of male breast cancer, randomized studies are lacking.
Treatment.
Treatment largely follows patterns that have been set for the management of postmenopausal breast cancer. The initial treatment is surgical and consists of a modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection or lumpectomy and radiation therapy with similar treatment results as in women. Also, mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy is a treatment option. In men with node-negative tumors, adjuvant therapy is applied under the same considerations as in women with node-negative breast cancer. Similarly, with node-positive tumors, men increase survival using the same adjuvants as affected women, namely both chemotherapy plus tamoxifen and other hormonal therapy. There are no controlled studies in men comparing adjuvant options. In the vast majority of men with breast cancer hormone receptor studies are positive, and those situations are typically treated with hormonal therapy.
Locally recurrent disease is treated with surgical excision or radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Distant metastases are treated with hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both. Bones can be affected either by metastasis or weakened from hormonal therapy; bisphosphonates and calcitonin may be used to counterbalance this process and strengthen bones.
Chemotherapeutic and hormonal options in male breast cancer.
Chemotherapeutic options include:
Hormonal options include:
Prognosis.
Adjusted for age and stage the prognosis for breast cancer in men is similar to that in women. Prognostically favorable are smaller tumor size and absence or paucity of local lymph node involvement. Hormonal treatment may be associated with hot flashes and impotence.

Liber Jani de Procida et Palialoco

The Liber Jani de Procida et Palialoco ("Book of John of Procida and Palaeologus") is a medieval Tuscan history of the Sicilian Vespers. It focusses on the conspiratorial role played by John of Procida, cast as the villain. It was almost certainly written in Tuscany and is often considered synoptic with the "Leggenda di Messer Gianni di Procida", written by a Modenese Guelf. The contemporaneous Sicilian "Rebellamentu di Sichilia" portrays John as a hero. Both Tuscan versions are later than the Sicilian, but may share the "Reballamentu" as a source. Conversely, all three may derive from an earlier, now lost source. All three agree on the centrality of John of Procida in the Vespers. The "Liber" emphasises his connexion with Michael VIII Palaeologus, the Byzantine emperor.
The famous story of the provocation of the Vespers through the rape of a Sicilian woman by a French soldier is contained within the "Rebellamentu" and "La vinuta di lu re Iapicu in Catania", the other Sicilian chronicle by Atanasiu di Iaci. The "Liber Jani" has a similar story, but in it the woman turns a knife on the Frenchman and his comrades come to his aid. The "Liber" is preserved in a Vatican manuscript and is published by Lodovico Antonio Muratori in his "Raccolta degli storici Italiani", XXXIV.43–78.

On July 7, 2009, Simson made history by becoming the first federal politician in Canada to publicize her claimed expenses for the fiscal year on her website, saying:
"I have been a taxpayer a lot longer than I ever have been an MP, and as a taxpayer this was a real bone of contention. ... It was all about accountability. I may not succeed, but in my little piece of the world, my constituents can go on my website and will be able to see how the money is spent. It's their money. That's the bottom line."
On November 6, 2009, Simson's motion M-354, which called upon the government to develop and adopt a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, was unanimously adopted. 
"This declaration is an agreement among people and nations to recognize that animals are sentient, suffer, have welfare needs, and to ultimately end animal cruelty worldwide. Thousands of Canadians have signed petitions in support of a UDAW and this declaration is actively supported by Canada's foremost animal protection organizations." 
Simson was also a founding member and Co-Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on palliative and Compassionate Care (PCPCC), a non-partisan Parliamentary group aimed at promoting awareness of glaring deficiences in Canada's palliative and compassionate care framework.
After serving for just over two-and-a-half years as an MP, Simson ran for re-election in her Scarborough Southwest riding in 2011. She was defeated, coming in third.

Hudson Valley Bears

The Hudson Valley Bears were an ice hockey team in the Eastern Professional Hockey League. They split their home games between the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York and the Ice Time Sports Complex in Newburgh, New York.
History.
2008-2009.
The Hudson Valley Bears were founded in 2008 as an Eastern Professional Hockey League expansion team. The Bears were the savior of the league. The Bears were founded to be the 4th team in the league and save the EPHL season after Copper City Chiefs and New Hampshire Freeze folded. The Bears had little success during their first season, as they finished their inaugural regular season at 3-45-1-1, finished dead last and missing the playoffs by 54 pts. They also finished last in attendance with average attendance 235. 
In October 2008, weeks before the first games were scheduled, two franchises pulled out, leaving three teams. Rather than postpone the season, a replacement was cobbled together: the Hudson Valley Bears, who played their home games in Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York and the Ice Time Sports Complex in Newburgh, New York.
The Bears’ roster was drawn from a pool of nearly 100 “local guys with part-time jobs,” as Jim Riggs, the league commissioner, put it.

Robert Hues

Robert Hues (1553 – 24 May 1632) was an English mathematician and geographer. He attended St. Mary Hall at Oxford, and graduated in 1578. Hues became interested in geography and mathematics, and studied navigation at a school set up by Walter Raleigh. During a trip to Newfoundland, he made observations which caused him to doubt the accepted published values for variations of the compass. Between 1586 and 1588, Hues travelled with Thomas Cavendish on a circumnavigation of the globe, performing astronomical observations and taking the latitudes of places they visited. Beginning in August 1591, Hues and Cavendish again set out on another circumnavigation of the globe. During the voyage, Hues made astronomical observations in the South Atlantic, and continued his observations of the variation of the compass at various latitudes and at the Equator. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and Hues returned to England the following year.
In 1594, Hues published his discoveries in the Latin work "Tractatus de globis et eorum usu" ("Treatise on Globes and Their Use") which was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593, and to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation. Hues' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch, English, French and Latin.
Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh in the 1590s, and later became a servant of Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton. While Grey was imprisoned in the Tower of London for participating in the Bye Plot, Hues stayed with him. Following Grey's death in 1614, Hues attended upon Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland, when he was confined in the Tower; one source states that Hues, Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner were Northumberland's constant companions and known as his "Three Magi", although this is disputed. Hues tutored Northumberland's son Algernon Percy (who was to become the 10th Earl of Northumberland) at Oxford, and subsequently (in 1622–1623) Algernon's younger brother Henry. In later years, Hues lived in Oxford where he was a fellow of the University, and discussed mathematics and related subjects with like-minded friends. He died on 24 May 1632 in the city and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral.
Early years and education.
Robert Hues was born in 1553 at Little Hereford in Herefordshire, England. In 1571, at the age of 18 years, he entered Brasenose College, University of Oxford. English antiquarian Anthony à Wood (1632–1695) wrote that when Hues arrived at Oxford he was "only a poor scholar or servitor ... he continued for some time a very sober and serious servant ... but being sensible of the loss of time which he sustained there by constant attendance, he transferred himself to St Mary's Hall". Hues graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree on 12 July 1578, having shown marked skill in Greek. He later gave advice to the dramatist and poet George Chapman for his 1616 English translation of Homer, and Chapman referred to him as his "learned and valuable friend". According to the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", there is unsubstantiated evidence that after completing his degree Hues was held in the Tower of London, though no reason is given for this, then went abroad after his release. It is possible he travelled to Continental Europe.
Hues was a friend of the geographer Richard Hakluyt, who was then regent master of Christ Church. In the 1580s, Hakluyt introduced him to Walter Raleigh and explorers and navigators whom Raleigh knew. In addition, it is likely that Hues came to know astronomer and mathematician Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner at Thomas Allen's lectures in mathematics. The four men were later associated with Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland, who was known as the "Wizard Earl" for his interest in scientific and alchemical experiments and his library.
Career.
Hues became interested in geography and mathematics – an undated source indicates that he disputed accepted values of variations of the compass after making observations off the Newfoundland coast. He either went there on a fishing trip, or may have joined a 1585 voyage to Virginia arranged by Raleigh and led by Richard Grenville, which passed Newfoundland on the return journey to England. Hues perhaps become acquainted with the sailor Thomas Cavendish at this time, as both of them were taught by Harriot at Raleigh's school of navigation. An anonymous 17th-century manuscript states that Hues circumnavigated the world with Cavendish between 1586 and 1588 "purposely for taking the true Latitude of places"; he may have been the "NH" who wrote a brief account of the voyage that was published by Hakluyt in his 1589 work "The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation". In the year that book appeared, Hues was with Edward Wright on the Earl of Cumberland's raiding expedition to the Azores to capture Spanish galleons.
Beginning in August 1591, Hues joined Cavendish on another attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Sailing on the "Leicester", they were accompanied by the explorer John Davis on the "Desire". Cavendish and Davis agreed that they would part company once they had cleared the Strait of Magellan between Chile and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, as Davis intended to sail to America to search for the Northwest Passage. The expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, although Davis did discover the Falkland Islands. In the meantime, delayed in small harbours in the Strait with crew members dying from the cold, illness and starvation, Cavendish turned back eastwards to return to England. He was plagued by mutinous crewmen, and also by natives and Portuguese who attacked his sailors seeking food and water on shore. Increasingly depressed, Cavendish died in 1592 somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, possibly a suicide.
During the voyage, Hues made astronomical observations of the Southern Cross and other stars of the Southern Hemisphere while in the South Atlantic, and also observed the variation of the compass there and at the Equator. He returned to England with Davis in 1593, and published his discoveries in the work "Tractatus de globis et eorum usu" ("Treatise on Globes and Their Use", 1594), which he dedicated to Raleigh. The book was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593. Apparently, the book was also intended to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation, although Lesley Cormack has observed that the fact it was written in Latin suggests that it was aimed at scholarly readers on the Continent. In 1595, William Sanderson, a London merchant who had largely financed the globes' construction, presented a small globe together with Hues' "Latin booke that teacheth the use of my great globes" to Robert Cecil, a statesman who was spymaster and minister to Elizabeth I and James I. Hues' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch (1597, 1613 and 1622), English (1638 and 1659), French (1618) and Latin (1611, 1613, 1617, 1627, 1659 and 1663). In his book "An Accidence or The Path-way to Experience: Necessary for all Young Sea-men" (1626), John Smith, who founded the first permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown, Virginia, listed Hues' book among the works that a young seaman should study.
"Tractatus de globis" begins with a letter by Hues dedicated to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I's reign. However, he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the Spaniards and Portuguese if they had a complete knowledge of astronomy and geometry, which were essential to successful navigation. In the preface of the book, Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere, and refuted opposing theories. The treatise was divided into five parts. The first part described elements common to Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, including the circles and lines inscribed on them, zones and climates, and the use of each globe's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian. The second part described planets, fixed stars and constellations; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe, and discussed the length of the circumference of the earth and of a degree of a great circle. Part 4, which Hues considered the most important part of the work, explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun's position, latitude, course and distance, amplitudes and azimuths, and time and declination. The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on rhumb lines. In the work, Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the "nautical triangle" used for plane sailing. Difference of latitude and departure (or longitude) are two sides of the triangle forming a right angle, the distance travelled is the hypotenuse, and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course. If any two elements are known, the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of sines, tangents and secants.
In the 1590s, Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh – he was one of the executors of Raleigh's will – and he may have been the "Hewes" who dined with Northumberland regularly in 1591. He later became a servant of Thomas Grey, the 15th and last Baron Grey de Wilton (1575–1614). For participating in the Bye Plot, a conspiracy by Roman Catholic priest William Watson to kidnap James I and force him to repeal anti-Catholic legislation, Grey was attainted and forfeited his title in 1603. The following year, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Grey was given consent for Hues to stay in the Tower with him. Between 1605 and 1621, Northumberland was also confined in the Tower; he was suspected of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 because his relative Thomas Percy was among the conspirators.
In 1616, following Grey's death, Hues began to be "attendant upon th'aforesaid Earle of Northumberland for matters of learning", and was paid a yearly sum of £40 to support his research until Northumberland's death in 1632. Wood stated that Harriot, Hues and Warner were Northumberland's "constant companions, and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland's Three Magi. They had a table at the Earl's charge, and the Earl himself did constantly converse with them, and with Sir Walter Raleigh, then in the Tower". Together with the scientist Nathanael Toporley and the mathematician Thomas Allen, the men kept abreast of developments in astronomy, mathematics, physiology and the physical sciences, and made important contributions in these areas. According to the letter writer John Chamberlain, Northumberland refused a pardon offered to him in 1617, preferring to remain with Harriot, Hues and Warner. However, the fact that these companions of Northumberland were his "Three Magi" studying with him in the Tower of London has been regarded as a romanticisation by the antiquarian John Aubrey and disputed for lack of evidence. Hues was tutor to Northumberland's sons: first Algernon Percy, who subsequently became the 10th Earl of Northumberland, at Oxford where he matriculated at Christ Church in 1617; and later Algernon's younger brother Henry in 1622–1623. Hues lived at Christ Church at this time, but may have occasionally attended upon Northumberland at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex, and at Syon House in London after the latter's release from the Tower in 1622. Hues sometimes met Walter Warner in London, and they are known to have discussed the reflection of bodies.
Later life.
In later years, Hues lived in Oxford where he discussed mathematics and allied subjects with like-minded friends. Cormack states he was a fellow at the University. Under the terms of the will of Thomas Harriot, who died on 2 July 1621, Hues and Warner were given the responsibility of helping Harriot's executor Nathaniel Torporley to prepare Harriot's mathematical papers for publication. Hues was also required to help price Harriot's books and other possessions for sale to the Bodleian Library.
Hues, who did not marry, died on 24 May 1632 in Stone House, St. Aldate's (opposite the Blue Boar in central Oxford). This was the house of John Smith, M.A., the son of a cook at Christ Church named J. Smith. In his will, Hues made many small bequests to his friends, including a sum of £20 to his "kinswoman" Mary Holly (of whom nothing is known), and 20 nobles to each of her three sisters. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, and a monumental brass to him was placed in Christ Church with the following inscription:

Dean Lance

Dean Lance (born 4 April 1959) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer and coach, and current football manager at the North Queensland Cowboys of the NRL. He played in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership in the 1980s for the Newtown and Canberra clubs, captaining the Raiders for almost 5 years and winning two premierships with them. After playing he coached Super League clubs in Australia (Western Reds and Adelaide Rams) and in England (Leeds Rhinos).
Playing career.
A centre/five-eighth hailing from Narrabri, New South Wales, Lance played representative rugby league for Newcastle in their comprehensive 29-0 victory over France in 1977 before playing in the NSWRFL. He started playing first grade in the Sydney premiership in 1982 for the Newtown Jets, eventually moving to the back row, but at the end of the following year the club exited the competition. Lance moved to the Canberra Raiders and was named captain of the club in his second year there. He played in his first Grand Final for the Raiders in 1987 and in 1989 the captaincy of the club was handed over to Mal Meninga. That year Lance played in his second grand final, this time winning the premiership. In the post season he travelled with the Raiders to England for the 1989 World Club Challenge which was lost to Widnes. The following year was to be his last with Canberra, but he went out on a high note, with a second consecutive premiership victory.
Coaching career.
Lance's coaching career began as reserve grade coach at Canberra in 1992, later being promoted to assistant coach. He took over from Peter Mulholland at the Perth Reds in the 1997 Super League season. The club was shut down at the end of that season so he signed as coach of the Adelaide Rams in the first year of the National Rugby League competition following Rod Reddy's dismissal. That was to be the final season for the Adelaide club as well, so again Lance was left without a team to coach. He moved to England and became coach of the Leeds Rhinos club in the European Super League in November 1999, succeeding fellow Australian Graham Murray. He served there for three seasons, achieving mixed results and having a less than perfect relationship with the club. Just four matches into the 2001 season, Lance parted from the Rhinos "by mutual consent".
After returning to Australia, Lance took on a football manager's role at the Melbourne Storm club, working with coach and former Canberra teammate, Craig Bellamy. Following the Storm's premiership victory in 2007, Lance moved to the North Queensland Cowboys club, also as football manager.

Ken Suarez

Kenneth Raymond Suarez (Born April 12, 1943) is a former Major League Baseball catcher. The 5'9", 175 lb. right-handed hitter is best remembered for a suit he filed against the Texas Rangers in which he claimed that his February 12, trade to the Cleveland Indians was in retaliation for his having filed for arbitration. Suarez never reported to camp for the Indians, retiring at just thirty years old, instead.
Seminoles.
Suarez was born in Tampa, Florida, and attended Jesuit High School. As well as being the catcher for the Jesuit Tigers, Suarez played for West Tampa's American Legion team with Lou Piniella and Tony La Russa.
Suarez attended Florida State University, and took over catching duties for the Seminoles baseball team as a sophomore in . After leading his team to the College World Series in 1963, Suarez erupted his junior year. He batted .404 with 44 hits, six home runs, thirty runs batted in, 25 runs scored and 21 walks, all tops on his team. He was named a First Team All-American by the American Baseball Coaches Association, and was selected to the 1964 U.S. Olympic Baseball Team. After which, he signed with the Kansas City Athletics as an amateur free agent.
Kansas City A's.
Suarez's first professional hit was a grand slam while playing for the Lewiston Broncs in . That season, he batted .253 with thirteen home runs and twenty RBIs while providing excellent defense for the Broncs and Double-A Birmingham Barons to earn an invitation to spring training in . He won the starting job out of camp, but lost the job to Phil Roof after batting just .185 with two RBI through May. He hung around at the major league level through the All-Star break before being optioned to Double-A Mobile.
An injury to Roof early in the season once again earned Suarez a promotion to starting catcher. He hit his first major league home run in his first start of the season against Mickey Lolich of the Detroit Tigers. He batted .235 with two home runs and four RBI in eight games filling in for Roof. Once Roof returned, Suarez remained with the club as a back-up catcher. After the season, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 1967 Rule V draft.
Cleveland Indians.
Suarez did not receive much playing time in Cleveland, appearing in only seventeen games in , two of which were out of his natural position in extra inning affairs. He had just one hit in ten at-bats. He split between the Indians and the Pacific Coast League Portland Beavers, batting .294 with nine RBIs in 85 major league at-bats. He spent all of in the minors with the Wichita Aeros, and batted .301, marking the only time he batted over .300 in his professional career. Given a more regular role in , Suarez appeared in 50 games for the Indians, hitting only .203 in 123 at-bats.
Texas Rangers.
On December 2, , he was traded to the Rangers with Roy Foster, Rich Hand, and Mike Paul for Del Unser, Denny Riddleberger, Terry Ley and Gary Jones. He spent most of his first season with the Rangers as the third string catcher before being reassigned to the Double-A Denver Bears. He platooned with Dick Billings behind the plate in , and produced a .248 batting average while establishing himself as one of the better fielding catchers in the American League. On June 16, he broke up a Jim Palmer perfect game. Palmer had retired the first 25 batters, however Suarez singled with one out in the ninth inning.
Suarez earned $20,000 in 1973 for the Rangers, and felt he was due for a raise. On February 7, 1974, he met with Rangers General Manager Dan O'Brien to negotiate a new contract. Failing to reach an agreement, he became the first player on the team to submit a contract to arbitration. Five days later, he was traded back to the Cleveland Indians for shortstop Leo Cárdenas.
Retirement.
Suarez immediately filed a formal grievance with the Major League Baseball Players Association asking that the trade be voided. He did not report to camp with the Indians, threatening to retire instead.
He made good on his threat, never appearing in a game for the Indians. Regardless, he was traded on September 12, 1974 to the California Angels with Rusty Torres for Frank Robinson.
Overall, Suarez hit .227 with five home runs and 60 RBI in 295 games (661 at-bats). He walked 99 times and struck out 97 times. After baseball, Suarez and his wife stayed in Fort Worth, Texas. He has worked in various fields, including aviation, radio and now agriculture.

Mehmed Namık Pasha

Mushir (Marshal) Mehmed Emin Namık Pasha (Istanbul, 1804 – Istanbul, 1892) was a major Ottoman statesman of the nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire. He served under five sultans and acted as counsellor to at least four of them. He founded the "Mekteb-i Harbiye" (The Ottoman Military Academy), was twice viceroy of the province of Bagdad, was the first ambassador of the Sublime Porte at Saint-James's Court, was appointed "Serasker" (Commander-in-chief / Minister of War), became a Cabinet minister, and was conferred the title of "Şeyh-ül Vüzera" (Head of Imperial Ministers). During a long career that spanned a long lifetime (he lived to be eighty-eight), he was one of the personalities who shaped, as well as were themselves shaped by what historian İlber Ortaylı called “the longest century” of the Ottoman state (see his "İmparatorluğun En Uzun Yüzyılı", 1983).
His son, Hasan Riza Pasha, was a general in the Ottoman Army.
Biography.
Namık was born in Istanbul, the son of Halil Ramis Agha, an instructor at the Ottoman Court, whose grandfather, Ümmeti Konevî (Ümmet from Konya) had migrated from Konya. He was taught privately by his father until the age of fourteen, when, in 1816, he was appointed (as "şakird" - student apprentice) to the secretariat of the "Divanı Hümayun" (Imperial Cabinet) where he polished his education with courses in Arabic, Persian, grammar, Turkish elocution, and religious studies, as well as in French and English. He was sent to Paris when Sultan Mahmud II (1785-1839, reign 1808-1839). selected him as one of the Divanı Hümayun şakirds to be sent to study in Europe, and attended the École Militaire there, improving at the same time the French he had already acquired. 
On his return, one of the duties of Namık Efendi, as a member of the secretariat of the "Divanı Hümayu"n, was to join as second interpreter the Ottoman delegation which signed in 1826 the Akkerman Convention with the Russians. In 1826 also, the Order of Janissaries was dissolved, and in preparation for the restructuring of the military, he was given the job of translating French texts concerning military rules and regulations. As he did a good job, Sultan Mahmud II, who gave great importance to these texts, rewarded him in 1827 with the rank of "alayemin", an act which, beyond being a token of appreciation, signaled Namık Efendi's entry into the ranks of the military. A year later Namık Bey was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was sent to Saint-Petersburg as military attaché with the duty first and foremost of studying the organization of the Russian army. He returned a year later, to be appointed as colonel to a regiment which he succeeded to turn into an exemplary regiment. He was made brigade-general for his efforts in 1832. 
Namık Pasha was sent the same year as special envoy to London, with the rank of ambassador plenipotentiary, to ask for naval assistance against the insurgent Khedive Mohammed Ali of Egypt whom France was protecting. He was received by King William IV in due pomp but the British proved ultimately unable to provide what he requested. He did however, take advantage of the opportunity: he secured arms from the U.K., and obtained the possibility of fourteen students to be sent by the Ottoman government to study in artillery, infantry and naval schools in the U.K. In fact, he spent all the time left from visits of courtesy he was obliged to make, on touring military schools, factories, and shipyards—although he also befriended the likes of Talleyrand, French ambassador in London at the time. For example, one of the technological advancements he brought back word of was of an improved lamp for Lighthouses.
Co-founder of Mekteb-i Harbiye.
Once back in Istanbul, Namık Pasha reintegrated his post as brigade-general. When the establishment of a military college for officers became indispensable, it is to Namık Pasha, alongside Marshal Ahmed Fevzi Pasha, already the director of a military school in Selimiye, that the Sultan turned to entrust in 1834 the organization and administration of the "Mekteb-i Harbiye". Today the College, which boasts of having had Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) as student, has been moved from Istanbul to Ankara and is called Kara Harp Okulu (School of War for Ground Forces), but is still functioning.
Ambassador to London.
On his dispatches from London, Namık Pasha had indicated the necessity of a permanent representative of the Sublime Porte in such capitals as Paris and London. When an embassy was indeed opened in London, it fell to Namık Pasha to be the first to fill the post. He remained in London from 1834 to 1836, and had contacts with such statesmen as Palmerston and Wellington. Namık Pasha was well received in London, and displayed both fluency with language but also at adapting to local social customs.
Naval Commander.
On his return to the Ottoman capital, and once again serving as general, he was made "ferik" (a rank between general and marshal, instituted after the dismantling of the Janissary Order), and was sent to Trablus (Tripoli in today's Libya) alongside Tahir Pasha to fight rebellious troops. Fifteen months later the rebellion had been crushed and for his valor Namık Pasha was promoted (1837/1838). (Sultan Abdülmecit began reigning in 1839.) This military success was a turning point in his career as it paved the way for his many positions as army commander and imperial administrator, and steered him away from diplomacy.
Commander of the Arabian Army.
Various other posts followed and in 1843, elevated to being a "vezir" (imperial minister), Namık Paşa was appointed Commander of the Arabian Army, with the rank of "Müşir" (Marshall), a position he would assume a year later and would carry for five years.
Viceroy of the Province of Baghdad.
In 1851 he was made Marshall of the Iraqi and Hejaz armies and viceroy of the province of Baghdad — only to be called back a year later (in 1852) because the way he had dealt with one of the cases of rebellion had displeased — to his own immense satisfaction however, as he wrote in his letters, since he had been away from Istanbul for nine consecutive years. British Major General Henry Rawlinson in a letter dated 1852 to then Foreign Secretary Malmesbury, strongly criticizes Namık Pasha's harsh approach to maintaining order.
Minister of Commerce.
Awarded a medal of the second rank of the Mecidî Order, Namık Pasha was made on his return, first, Marshall of Tophane (1852); then, Minister of Commerce (1853). 
The Crimean War saw the Ottoman state in dire need and it was to Namık Paşa, as Minister of Commerce, that fell the duty of looking for funds — begging for money from bankers — in Europe, a venture which took him to Paris and London for the whole of the winter season of 1853-1854 (from November to May) and during which he was received by Napoleon III. Yet, had this seasoned diplomat run out of practice during a decade spent in the Arabian desert? He famously came back empty-handed. Commentators are at variance in interpreting this outcome: the directives he was given were too rigid and he was not vested with sufficient authority to make the necessary decisions, for some; he was too proud on behalf of the Ottoman state, for others; the interest rates insisted by the European bankers were too high and the parties were mutually too hesitant, and too distrustful, according to some others. “It had become very clear that the Porte would not be able to borrow without the guarantees of the allied governments. Thus it was rather the Porte's instructions, the international conjuncture, problems with the credibility of the Porte and attitudes of the British ministers that ... really prevented the loan's materialization rather than Namık Pasha's 'amateurishness' and unwillingness. Under such conditions, anyone in his place could be equally unsuccessful,” according to one commentator (see Badem, p. 273). History would nevertheless record his name as the man who initiated the search for the debts, as these would be secured very soon after, as a result of the steps he had taken and the paths he had opened.
Viceroy of Jeddah.
Several other posts, administrative or diplomatic, ensued. He was appointed viceroy of Jeddah in 1856, then was made President of the Military Council in 1860, and later "Serasker" (Commander in chief). During Namık Pasha's term as Viceroy of Jeddah, a blundering move by the local British Vice-Consul and ham-fisted military intervention by the British marines in a property dispute led to events that ended in the death of 22 foreigners including the British Consul and his wife. Namık Pasha was away on mission during the events, and dealt swiftly with the aftermath on his return. However he would nevertheless be held responsible in the eyes of England.
In 1860 Namık Pasha was nominated by the Ottoman Empire to be the Ottoman special envoy to Syria. However, France and England opposed this appointment, in part possibly due to resentment over the events in Jeddah, and the Porte accepted to appoint Fuad Pasha instead.
Viceroy of Baghdad, Basra and Mosul.
A year later, in 1861 (the year Sultan Abdülaziz ascended the throne), he was sent on his second and longer post as viceroy to the province of Baghdad, to which were added the provinces of Basra and Mosul — in fact, the present-day Iraq. He succeeded in quieting down rebellious tribes and accomplished much in the way of construction. He replenished the Basra shipyard with ships he ordered from Istanbul, increased the traffic on the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, had bridges built, and made the land arable through irrigation. He had various government buildings, military barracks, schools and roads constructed. He made sure the customs revenue would enter the Baghdad treasury, increased commerce, put a stop to fraudulent practices in title deeds and thus was able to regularize tax revenue. In 1867, when he returned, he brought to the public purse in Istanbul a considerable amount of money his office had amassed in Baghdad.
For his achievements in Baghdad, he received the medal of the first rank of the Order of Osman. The Shah of Iran also presented him with a medal. 
Namık Pasha commissioned the construction, with his own savings, of a building to house the Ministry of War, the edifice which now functions as Istanbul University's main building in Beyazit and has come to symbolize “university” in Turkey.
Minister of Naval Forces.
In 1872 he was made Minister of Naval Forces, and selected as a member of the Ayan Meclisi (Ottoman Senate) in 1877. (Sultan Abdülhamid II acceeded to the throne in 1876). He was a member of the delegation which signed the Edirne Armistice with the Russians after the 1877-1878 war. 
Among the various titles he held was also that of "yaver-i ekrem" (aide de camp to His Imperial Majesty), and it is in that capacity that he carried a note from the Sultan to Alexander II. He received from the latter the medal of the Alexander Nevsky Order. 
He was made "Şeyh-ül Vüzera" in 1883. 
Namık Pasha spent the last years of his life in retirement in the "konak" he owned that extended from Ayapaşa to Kabataş. It is in that mansion that he played host to Empress Eugénie when she came to Istanbul. The "Namık Paşa Yokuşu" street in the area where his estate had been is named after him. 
His death marked the end of an epoch. 
As befits an Ottoman grandee, he was married four times but divorced one of his wives. From the other three, he had eleven children.
His descendants live today mostly in Turkey (although some are located in the U.S.A, the U.K., France, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia), and many are prominent personalities in the Turkish mainstream. His late great-grandson, Ahmet Sinaplı, authored "Şeyhül Vüzera, Serasker Mehmet Namık Paşa," the only monograph so far dedicated to this Ottoman statesman who had represented throughout his life the proud and refined face of the Ottoman Empire.

Roman Catholic prayers to Jesus

A number of prayers to Jesus Christ exist within the Roman Catholic tradition. These prayers have diverse origins and forms. Some were attributed to visions of saints, others were handed down by tradition.
Some such prayers are provided in the Raccolta Roman Catholic prayer book, first published in association with the Roman Catholic Congregation of Indulgences in 1807.
Various prayers listed in this article are due to saints, or have been used by saints (e.g. Augustine of Hippo, Ignatius of Loyola, Louis de Montfort, etc.) but they are usually not associated with a specific Catholic devotion with a feast day. They are therefore grouped separately from the prayers that accompany Roman Catholic devotions to Christ such as Holy Face of Jesus or Divine Mercy.
In many cases specific promises and powers are attributed to specific prayers or devotions to Jesus although some prayers of reparation include no petition.
Anima Christi.
Literary meaning "Soul of Christ", this is an ancient and very well known Catholic prayer. It dates back to the early fourteenth century or perhaps before. At some point in history it was attributed to St. Ignatius Loyola, who used it in his Spiritual Exercises, but it was later found in texts that predated St. Ignatius. 
The sequence of sentences in Anima Christi have rich associations with Catholic concepts that relate to the Holy Eucharist (Body and Blood of Christ), Baptism (water) and the Passion of Jesus (Holy Wounds).
Jean-Baptiste Lully composed a Motet called Anima Christi, and musicians such as Giovanni Valentini performed it.
Act of Consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
This 17th-century prayer is by Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque. It was part of the private revelations reported by her regarding the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
Morning offering.
The "Morning offering to the Sacred Heart of Jesus" prayer is meant to be prayed first thing in the morning. It was composed by Fr. Francois Xavier Gaulrelet in 1844 and reflects the "Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary" by referring to the Immaculate Heart of Mary:
Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
Pope Leo XIII composed this prayer in 1899 and included it in his 1899 encyclical "Annum Sacrum" which consecrated the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The consecration was motivated by letters sent to the Pontiff by a Good Shepherd nun, Mary of the Divine Heart, who stated that in a vision of Jesus Christ she had been told to request the consecration.
Prayer of repentance.
Bishop Lancelot Andrewes composed the following prayer:
O Lord Jesus Christ, look upon us with those eyes of thine where-with thou dist look upon Peter in the hall; that with Peter we may repent and, by the same love be forgiven; for thine
mercy's sake. Amen.
Prayer to the shoulder wound of Jesus.
This prayer is attributed to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux According to St. Bernard, he asked Jesus which was His greatest unrecorded suffering and the wound that inflicted the most pain on Him in Calvary and Jesus answered:
The modern version of the prayer bears the imprimatur of Bishop Thomas D. Bevan, Diocese of Springfield, Mass. 1892.
Saint John Vianney's prayer to Jesus.
Saint John Vianney, the patron saint of parish priests, composed his prayer to Jesus in the 19th century. 
The prayer reflects Vianney's deep religious feelings, which were praised by Pope John XXIII in his encyclical "Sacerdotii Nostri Primordia" in 1959.
The prayer is quoted witin the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
You are Christ.
This ancient prayer was composed by St. Augustine of Hippo. This is a somewhat long prayer in three parts.
The first part is a list of titles and salutations to Jesus, namely: "my Holy Father, my Tender God, my Great King, my Good Shepherd... my Everlasting Salvation."
The second part involves a set of conversational questions, e.g. ".. why have I ever loved, why in my whole life have I ever desired anything except You, Jesus my God?..."
The third part is a list of petitions, namely "...may every good feeling that is fitted for Your praise, love You, delight in You... may I be found consummated with You!"
Prayer of St. John Gabriel Perboyre to Jesus.
Saint John Gabriel Perboyre, priest and martyr composed this prayer in the 19th century.
The theme of the prayer is to help transform oneself to be more like Jesus and to banish all that in unlike Jesus from one's heart, soul and memory. This transformational prayer builds towards Saint Paul's statement in Galatians 2:20: ""I live - now not I - But Christ lives in me"".
Saint Louis de Montfort's Prayer to Jesus.
This prayer is a reflection of Saint Louis de Montfort's philosophy of "total consecration to Jesus Christ through Mary" a theme that centuries later influenced the development of Roman Catholic Mariology.
Although St Louis is perhaps best known for his Mariology and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, his spirituality is founded on the mystery of the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, and is centered on Christ, as reflected in his collected works God Alone.
As the prayer suggests St. Louis introduced the key concepts that underlie Roman Catholic Mariology today: that Jesus and Mary are son and mother, redeemer and redeemed and that the path to Jesus is through Mary. Theologically, the prayer reflects the inherent inclusion of Mariology in Christology.
Prayer before a Crucifix.
This prayer is usually said while kneeling before a crucifix. It is often said by Roman Catholics after Communion or after Mass. 
The faithful receive a partial indulgence if they recite the prayer after Communion before a crucifix. On the Fridays of Lent, the indulgence is a plenary indulgence.

Lohner B.I

__NOTOC__
The Lohner B.I was a military reconnaissance aircraft produced in Austria-Hungary during World War I. As Lohner strove to perfect the design, a variety of increasingly powerful engines were fitted, reflected in a range of military designations from B.II through to B.VI until the definitive B.VII was finally produced. This last version was also produced in an armed variant, designated the C.I.
The B.I design originated before the war and was initially known as the "Pfielflieger" ("Arrow-flier") on account of its sharply swept-back wings, giving it an arrow-shaped planform. Apart from this feature, it was an otherwise conventional biplane design with two-bay, staggered wings of unequal span. The pilot and observer (or instructor) sat in tandem in an open cockpit. The first batch was produced for the "Luftschiffabteilung" ("Airship Section") of the Austro-Hungarian army in late 1912, after a national fundraising campaign conducted by the "Österreichischer Aero-Club" ("Austrian Aero-Club"). Known at this time as the Type B, the army took delivery of 28 aircraft before asking Lohner to develop a version better suited for mountain-flying, leading to the B.II which replaced the B.I in production in mid 1914. However, during the course of 1915, production was briefly revived (along with the then-surpassed B.II) under licence at Flugzeugwerk Fischamend for use as trainers.

Glenn Thibeault

Glenn Thibeault (born October 23, 1969) is a Canadian politician. Since 2008, he has represented the Ontario electoral district of Sudbury in the Canadian House of Commons. He is a member of the New Democratic Party, and was the first non-Liberal candidate to win a federal election in Sudbury since Bud Germa in 1967.
Early life and career.
Thibeault was born in Sudbury, and was a newscaster and reporter at local stations CIGM and CJRQ during the 1990s. He later graduated from the developmental services worker program at Cambrian College, and was hired as a behavioural consultant for the West Vancouver School Board in British Columbia. He worked for five years as coordinator at the Mainstream Association for Pro-Active Community Living in Vancouver, and returned to Sudbury in 2003 to become campaign director of the United Way of Sudbury and District. In June 2005, he was promoted to executive director. The United Way held several successful campaigns in this period, increasing its total from $1.3 million in 2003 to $2.3 million in 2007.
Member of Parliament.
Thibeault won the New Democratic Party's Sudbury nomination in September 2008, after the resignation of previously nominated candidate Gerry McIntaggart and the withdrawal of Dave Battaino from the contest. He received endorsements from the "Sudbury Star" newspaper, the Sudbury and District Labour Council and United Steelworkers of America Local 2020, and won an upset victory over six-term Liberal Party incumbent Diane Marleau. 
The Conservative Party won a minority government in this election, and Thibeault entered parliament as a member of the opposition. He was appointed as his party's critic for consumer protection and amateur sport in late November 2008. Along with other New Democratic Party MPs, he later called for an investigation into the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's handling of tainted milk that was sold in Sudbury and other parts of Ontario. Thibeault supported a planned coalition government of Liberals and New Democrats in late 2008, and wrote an editorial describing Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper as a "coward" for proroguing parliament when it appeared his government would be defeated by the coalition in a motion of non-confidence. The coalition was abandoned when Michael Ignatieff became Liberal Party leader, and decided to support the Conservative government's January 2009 budget.
Thibeault called on the federal government to regulate interest rates and fees on credit cards and debit cards in March 2009, describing existing rates as "out of control" and a hindrance to consumers and businesses during an economic downturn. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty later announced that his government would launch an education campaign and provide for increased disclosure on credit-card statements, but would not regulate rates. Thibeault described this as "disappointing". On June 18, 2010, Thibeault introduced a private member's bill to cap annual interest rates on credit cards to no more than five per cent above the current Bank of Canada target for overnight rates.
Thibeault also introduced a private member's bill in April 2009 to ensure the cost of Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) and Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI) for autistic persons is provided by health insurance programs in every province. He later introduced another private bill to have the third Saturday in June recognized as Emergency Services Appreciation Day in Canada.
Thibeault stood with striking workers from Vale Inco in the summer of 2009, and criticized Industry Minister Tony Clement's announcement that the federal government would not intervene to stop job and production cuts in Sudbury. He called for Clement's resignation after the minister stated that Vale had "saved Sudbury" from becoming a "Valley of Death" by purchasing Inco in 2006. He also protested cuts to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Northern Ontario radio services in this period.
Thibeault, as the New Democrat critic for Sport, has been instrumental in raising national awareness about the very serious increase of violence in amateur sport and the ongoing concussion epidemic plaguing amateur hockey. He called for a Royal Commission to study violence in sports in February 2010; his call has been echoed by others, including Jaime Watt, a conservative strategist. In February 2011, Thibeault introduced Bill C-616, calling for a national strategy to reduce the incidence of serious injury in amateur sport.
He was successfully re-elected in the 2011 election.
Provincial politics.
Thibeault supported Gilles Bisson's bid to lead the Ontario New Democratic Party at its 2009 leadership convention.

Children in Need 2008

Children in Need 2008 was a campaign held in the United Kingdom to raise money for Children in Need. It culminated in a live broadcast on BBC One on the evening of Friday 14 November, through to the morning of Saturday 15 November. The broadcast was hosted by Terry Wogan, Fearne Cotton and Tess Daly joined by other guest presenters throughout the night, including Alesha Dixon presenting from BT Tower. The voice-over reading out running totals was Alan Dedicoat. The 2008 event broke all previous records, with a total of £20,991,216 raised by the end of the broadcast.
Television campaign.
"QI".
During the customary break for the "BBC News at Ten" the first episode of the 6th series of "QI" was screened on BBC Two. The episode had a Children in Need theme. As with previous Children in Need specials, it guest starred Pudsey Bear, David Mitchell and Ronni Ancona, however immediately following the contestant introductions, Terry Wogan appeared to dismiss Pudsey and take his place. Stephen Fry admitted on Twitter that the special was recorded in May or June of this year.
"Celebrity Scissorhands".
A third series of "Celebrity Scissorhands" was shown in the run up to the 2008 event, again featuring celebrity hairdresser Lee Stafford and Steve Strange as lead stylist. The winner was Sabrina Washington with Jeff Leach as the runner up.
Official single.
On 30 October 2008 the BBC announced that the 2008 Children in Need official single would be a double A side of "Do Ya" and a cover of Faces "Stay With Me" by British pop band McFly. The songs were released for download on 23 November and in stores the following day, with all profits raised going to the appeal. The band performed both songs as part of the 2008 broadcast on BBC1. "Do Ya" charted at Number 18 on 30 November 2008, making it the lowest chart entry for a Children in Need song to date.
Other activities.
As in previous years, the TV show Countryfile sold a calendar in aid of the appeal. In 2008, it raised £369,000.
Totals.
The following are totals with the times they were announced on the televised show.
It was announced during the broadcast that since 1980 the appeal had raised over £500,000,000 towards helping children in the UK.

Fay ki Boli

Fay Kee Bolee (, lit. "Fay Language") is a language game used by Urdu-speaking people in Pakistan. It can be regarded as a trivial substitution cipher and it is sometimes used by adults to converse in (perceived) privacy in the presence of children. It is close to games found in other languages such as Farfallino alphabet (Italian), jeringonza (Spanish/Portuguese), and Pig Latin (English).
""Fay"" (), Urdu language Alphabet corresponding to the sound of "F" in English, can be replaced by most other consonants to form another variety. Pay ki Boli is another more complex variation of the language game.
Rules.
The game is based on a simple substitution: adding an extra "F" before each vowel of a syllable. Insert "fay" in the middle of each syllable (usually before the vowel - splitting the syllable into two) in each word. In some monosyllabic words which would still be so obvious, ""yay"" (), Urdu alphabet for "Y", is added at after "fay" and in reverse before completing the rest of the half.

Prix de Beauté

Prix de Beauté (, UK title: Miss Europe) is a 1930 film directed by Augusto Genina. The film is notable for being the first sound film made by star Louise Brooks, although all of her dialogue and singing were dubbed. This film is an early example of sound film in France, along with "L'Age d'Or" and "Under the Roofs of Paris".
Plot.
Despite knowing of her jealous fiancé Andre's strong contempt for beauty contests, typist Lucienne "Lulu" Garnier (Louise Brooks) (along with many other hopefuls) mails two photographs of herself to enter the Miss France contest sponsored by the "Globe" newspaper. Upon further consideration, she tries to withdraw, but it is too late: she has already been chosen as a finalist. When she wins, she has to travel to Spain immediately to compete for the crown of Miss Europe without having an opportunity to break the news to Andre. When he finds out, he rushes to the train station too late.
Lucienne is selected by audience applause to be Miss Europe. She attracts numerous ardent admirers, among them a maharajah and Prince Adolphe de Grabovsky. Andre shows up and gives her an ultimatum: return to France with him within the hour or they are through. She is torn, but chooses him.
However, she is miserable in their apartment. When Grabovsky tracks her down to offer her a film contract with Sound Films International, she tears up the contract, but later that night, reconsiders and sneaks away to accept, leaving only a letter of explanation for Andre.
She makes a short film, which the studio executives decide to premiere. By chance, newspaper worker Andre is given the item to typeset. He goes to see Lucienne, but is told that she is viewing the film and cannot be disturbed. He sneaks in anyway and shoots her in the back, killing her instantly. Andre drops the gun and makes no resistance when apprehended. Ironically, the film shows Lucienne singing a song about a woman imploring her lover not to be jealous of other men's attentions.
Preservation status.
The unsynchronized sound version has been in circulation for many years. However, on July 18, 2013, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival will present a restoration of the original silent version recently completed by the Cineteca di Bologna.

1868 Hayward earthquake

The 1868 Hayward earthquake was the last large earthquake to occur on the Hayward Fault Zone in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States. It caused significant damage throughout the region, and was known as the "Great San Francisco Earthquake" prior to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
Earthquake.
The earthquake occurred at 7:53 a.m. on October 21, 1868. Its epicenter was likely located near Hayward, California, and its magnitude has been estimated to have been 6.8–7.0 on the Richter scale. At the surface, ground rupture was traced for 20 miles, from San Leandro to what is now the Warm Springs District in Fremont. The USGS estimates that Hayward experienced shaking measuring IX on the modified Mercalli scale. San Leandro experienced shaking measuring VIII, while San Francisco and Oakland experienced shaking measuring VII. 
Damage.
The town of Hayward experienced the most damage, with nearly every building destroyed or significantly damaged in the earthquake. The Alameda County Courthouse in San Leandro was destroyed, which resulted in the re-location of the County Seat to Oakland, its current site. The adobe chapel of Mission San José in what is now Fremont was also destroyed, as were several buildings in San Jose, San Francisco and throughout Alameda County. Damage was reported from Santa Rosa in the north to Gilroy and Santa Cruz in the south. Thirty deaths were attributed to the earthquake.

Nantucket Forests

The Nantucket forests have an unusual history. Continual salt saturated wind and nutrient poor soils set severe limits upon tree growth and the wood products that might be accessed by both indigenous peoples and colonial settlers. 
Short trees and short timbers.
Nantucket Island lies 30 miles off the southern coastline of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In 1775, Nantucket was the largest whaling port in the world, and the third largest port in Massachusetts. However, dominance in this most adventurous, dangerous and potentially lucrative of all maritime trades was not supported by an extensive, local, ship building industry. Early Nantucket forests were unusual and determined the scope of indigenous and colonial wooden ship building on Nantucket Island.
In spite of numerous statements about island forests as a source for lumber (see 1889 USGS report which only repeats local oral tradition), a strong case can be made that Nantucket has not been forested for the past 4,000 years at least in terms of what is usually thought of as a forest - numerous tall trees 50 or more feet in height. Visitors to Nantucket in the late 18th and early 19th centuries describe the island as nearly treeless. However, many publications mention post glacial forests composed of oak, with some beech, pine, maple, and hickory. These trees were present but only in small numbers and severely reduced in height. They were cut down for firewood, fence posts and short building timbers in the decades following settlement in 1659. Speculation that after the island trees were cut down, a rich soil was washed away by erosion cannot be confirmed. Nantucket has many small dry' valleys without outlets to the sea, and rich loam soil cannot be found in these localities. Old forests have not existed for the past 2,000 years or more, deep rich leaf mold is absent and adequate soil depth to provide root anchorage for large trees is not present. This photograph of a contemporary Nantucket moor depicts a landscape with few trees none of which are very tall, nor do they have straight trunks from which long timbers for shipbuilding or house construction could be made. These particulars make a relevant reference to the history of Nantucket forests. 
Oak building timber for houses and ships could not have been produced from island trees. Nantucket Island is a low altitude, sand dune environment with numerous ancient peat bogs and continual winds that are salt saturated. The highest points on Nantucket Island island are Folger Hill at 109 feet above sea level, and Altar Rock at 108 feet. In the mid 20th century, only two small strips of good loam could be identified on the island, and both were shallow. Evidence indicates that the last tall forest trees on Nantucket died at least 2,000 years ago, portions of their trunks have been preserved in ancient peat bogs. These are remains of tree trunks whose maximum diameters were 12' and trunk height was only a few feet above ground, Trees of 20–25 feet tall are indicated, a height that can rarely be exceeded because of continual exposure to blowing, salt saturated wind. Tree trunk remains found in these ancient peat bogs belong to the only three species that can survive long exposure in such environments: cypress, red cedar and white cedar. These tree species require fresh water, they no longer grow on Nantucket and were never available nor appropriate for long building or ship timbers. Frequent exposure to high winds and blowing salt severely restricts the maximum possible height for both hardwood and coniferous tree species. A storm with salt saturated, winds of 60–80 mph will tear apart the top branches of a tree. Blowing salt also adheres to bark and leaves and relentlessly penetrates the wood to induce rot and tissue death. Trees in more protected sites, are more than a few tall. Nonetheless, they are forced into a distorted growth pattern by the relentless, salt saturated wind. Maximum height is severely reduced, and their profile is very distinctive as seen in Theodore Robinson's painting done in 1882.
"On Nantucket, oak, pine and beech can attain heights of only a few feet, albeit with distorted trunks whose width would suggest a tall tree of the usual height. A typical black oak (Quercus_velutina) so formed, might have a 20" trunk diameter but a morphology that is severely restricted by 'wind pruning' and thereby less than one foot tall with branches buried or growing along the ground; or alternatively, many feet wide at the base but less than two feet in height to the fork in the trunk where branches form. Cedar roots can spread and coalesce on the ground creating a large mass of wood that has almost no height and is not a tree trunk. Low hills on the north east sector of the island afforded protection from severe wind pruning in the past but severe Erosion since 1896 has greatly reduced the altitude of these hills. In some protected niches, oak and beech trees did grow to 20–25 feet tall and were often cut when about 50 years of age for fence posts and firewood. A period of intense cutting of the remaining oak and beech trees of this size and age has been identified in the late 19th century. 
A consistent exception to this dwarfing of tree species is the Japanese Black Pine. It had evolved in an environment nearly identical to that of Nantucket, and was introduced in the late 19th century . Pitch pine will also achieve some height in highly acidic soils but was likely nonexistent on Nantucket prior to 1847 when introduced to be used in windbreaks. "Small patches of dry upland soils within these forests contain some beautiful, old examples of American beech, black oak, white oak, and American holly, trees that are now relatively rare on Nantucket."
The photographs in this article portray a selection of swamps and bogs whose characteristics resemble those reconstructed for the ancient swamplands on Nantucket. They are a best effort at depicting what the ancient swamps, bogs and adjoining forest trees might have look liked on Nantucket more than 2,000 years ago.
Wampanoag - canoes, long house, the forest.
Indigneous peoples likely did not have access to New England until the Wisconsin Glaciation began to retreat ~16,000 BC. At its maximum advance, the great ice sheets had reached Nantucket and Martha's Vinyard islands. There is evidence that Paleo-Indians settled on Nantucket, those people who were present at the end of the last ice age throughout North America. Radiocarbon dating indicates a first appearance in New England, ~10,000 BC. Water was essential for fishing and longer distance trade. Early Woodland period cultures persisted until ~0 AD. On Nantucket, and indigenous tribes had access to forest trees tall enough to provide long tree trunks for canoes and the lodge until ~0 AD as indicated above. 
The Wampanoag predominated among the indigenous peoples of Nantucket upon European contact. They acquired this identity from John Smith in 1616. At this time. there were ~ 12,000 Wampanoag living in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, Martha's Vinyard, Nantucket and Elizabeth Island. Their language places them within the Algonquian family of Native Americans. 
Wampanoag resource procurement was based upon the seasonal cycles of plant and animal foods. 
There is little information available about Wampanoag maritime craft. Their boats were small and assuredly used frequently on coastal waters, rivers and streams when the Wampanoag were fishing and hunting. Canoes were also used for occasional trading trips to other islands and the mainland. The short trees of Nantucket could provide logs from which to make a small canoe. Birch was very rare, if present at all, and if birch bark canoes were on Nantucket, they were imported. 
The largest building in Wampanoag village architecture was the long house that housed several families during winter in sheltered valleys. Long house construction did not require the large building timbers that were necessary to build English style houses and town buildings. As with all indigenous peoples who were both hunter/gatherers and agriculturalists, resources in all ecological niches that provided food were treated carefully with an understanding about conserving habitat and breeding populations for the long run. The very ancient Nantucket forests that had tall trees disappeared for reasons that had nothing to do with Wampanoag ancestor's utilization of the forest. 
We can only conclude that architectural and ship building timber of large size was not available to the early European and American colonists of Nantucket island, nor to the first nation Wampanoag people who frequented offshore waters, rivers and streams to hunt and fish throughout the year.

J. E. Ashworth &amp; Sons

J. E. Ashworth & Sons was a company that operated blanket mills in Hartland, Vermont, Westbrookville, New York and Whippany, New Jersey. They manufactured United States Army blankets, horse blankets, and bed blankets. They also performed custom wool carding.
History.
It was established by James Edward Ashworth (1831–1910) and his two sons, Albert P. Ashworth (1872–1934) and Daniel Gunner Ashworth (1876–1949). In 1880 James was working at a mill in Greenwich, New York and learning the trade. By 1883–1884 he was operating a mill in Hartland, Vermont where he was listed as a "manufacturer and wholesale dealer in heavy Army and horse blankets, bed blankets, and custom wool carding". The Vermont blanket factory, was originally the Sturtevant woolen-mills, it was operated by water-power, had five looms, it employed twelve men and made 10,000 blankets per year. J. E. Ashworth & Sons had a "reputation of turning out some of the finest blankets in the country." United States Trade Reports of Cincinnati, Ohio wrote on December 16, 1904: "The products of this establishment not only equal those offered by any other manufacturer, but in points of workmanship and finish cannot be surpassed, and no house in the country is more fully equipped to meet modern demands in this line. They are firm believers in quality and zealously guard the quality of their products at all times by using only the best materials and employing experienced workmen." Their fawn colored horse blankets were used by the Wells Fargo, American Express and Adams Express Company companies, and the Standard Oil and Atlantic Petroleum companies. The Westbrookville, New York mill burned down and was rebuilt, but closed permanently in 1961.

Ministers Deputies

The Ministers’ Deputies are the representatives of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers at Strasbourg.
While the Committee of Ministers is the executive organ of the Council of Europe, it actually only meets once year in Strasbourg, in what are known as the ministerial sessions. Its day to day work is carried out by the deputies, who are the permanent representatives, mostly of ambassadorial rank, the heads of their countries’ diplomatic missions in Strasbourg. So most of the time that the Committee of Ministers is quoted as having done something, it is actually the deputies who have taken the decision. Their decisions have the same weight and effect as the Committee of Ministers.
The Deputies currently meet at least once a week in plenary, usually on a Wednesday, in the great Committee of Ministers meeting room at the front of the Palace of Europe, and several times a week in committee, as one of their rapporteur groups, or "ad hoc" working groups. The frequency of meetings has increased considerably since 1989. They have regular special human rights meetings in their capacity of supervising the execution of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
The chairmanship of the deputies changes every six months, at each session of the Committee of Ministers, following the English alphabetical order of member states. The current chair (November 2013 - May 2014) is the Ambassador of Austria.
There is also a Bureau, set up in 1975 to assist the Chairmanship, which consists of the current chair, the two previous and the three future chairpersons.
History.
The system of permanent representatives was set up by the Committee of Ministers in May 1951. It was the following year that they took a separate decision to appoint a deputy to whom they delegated mostly of the work. Legally, therefore, the deputies and the permanent representatives are distinct, although for practical purposes they are almost always the same person. While they currently all reside in Strasbourg, this is not obligatory, and Ireland and Iceland only opened missions there in the 1990s.

Norman Rose

Norman Rose (June 23, 1917 – November 12, 2004, Upper Nyack, New York) was an actor, film narrator and radio announcer whose velvety baritone was often called "the Voice of God" by colleagues. He was best known as the voice of fictitious coffee grower Juan Valdez in the Colombian coffee television commercials and the announcer-narrator of NBC's "Dimension X".
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Rose started acting while a student at George Washington University in Washington, DC. Rose honed his craft at the Actors Studio Drama School in New York, then landed parts in plays on and off-Broadway.
Radio.
During World War II, he was recruited by the United States Office of War Information to work as a radio newscaster. After the war, Rose lent his distinctive voice to radio programs such as "Dimension X" and "CBS Radio Mystery Theater". He narrated the short film "Harold and the Purple Crayon" in 1959, and provided several of the voices on the 1963 CBS cartoon "Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales".
In 1948, Rose co-founded New Stages, an off-Broadway repertory company, with producer David Heilweil. New Stages presented the American debut of Jean-Paul Sartre's best-known play, "The Respectful Prostitute", prior to its Broadway run. Rose was an accomplished stage actor appearing in Broadway productions of "Richard III" and "St. Joan" and off-Broadway in "The Brothers Karamazov".
From 1969 to 1974, Rose stepped in front of the camera to portray the same character—psychiatrist Dr. Marcus Polk—on two ABC soap operas ("One Life to Live" and "All My Children"). He also appeared in the soap operas "The Edge of Night" and "Search for Tomorrow".
Films.
Nicknamed “The Voice of God” by colleagues because of his deep, recognizable voice, Rose was cast as something akin, actually the voice of "Death" in Woody Allen’s 1975 comedy "Love and Death". Rose’s other film work includes Woody Allen's "Radio Days" and the opening narration for director Kinji Fukasaku’s "Message from Space" (1978), narrating the English dub of the 1968 Soviet Union production of "War and Peace" and as a newsreel announcer in Mike Nichols’ "Biloxi Blues" (1988). On screen he was seen in "The Joe Louis Story" (1953),"The Violators" (1957), Sidney Lumet’s "The Anderson Tapes" (1971), "Who Killed Mary What’s Her Name?" (1971) and Martin Ritt's "The Front" (1976) (also starring Woody Allen). He also narrated the 1989 film documentary, "How Hitler Lost the War", produced by David Hoffman.
Rose was also the offscreen narrator for the telecast of Mikhail Baryshnikov's production of the ballet "The Nutcracker" (1977), a production that has been repeated many times on television and is available on DVD. He narrated the satirical "Deteriorata" for the National Lampoon album "Radio Dinner". Rose recorded numerous books for the blind and narrated the 70th anniversary broadcast of the Academy Awards. He also was a drama instructor at the Juilliard School.
Norman Rose died November 12, 2004 in Upper Nyack, New York.

Kankalis

Kankalis, Qanqlis, Kangly or Kangar ("Kanglı/Qangli/Kenger") were a Turkic people of Eurasia. Kangar was not applied to all the Pechenegs, but only attached to the three leading tribes. Alternatively they could have been Kipchaks. Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos notes in his "De Administrando Imperio" that three groups of the Pechenegs are called Kangar. The name "Kangar" is associated with the "Kang" territory and probably with the Kangaris people and the city of Kangu Tarban, mentioned in the Kul Tigin inscription of the Orkhon Turkic peoples. There still exist clans with the names of "Chushan-Kangli" and "Kabil-Kangle-Agakli" among the Nogais.
They first appear on history as minor branch of ancient Oghuz Turks. They formed one of the five sections which Oghuz khan divided his subjects. After the fall of Pecheneg Khanate in early 10th century, the role of Kankali Turks became prominent. They were closely related to Kypchaks. They may have been a separate nomadic people earlier but the Turkic peoples in Pontic-Steppe become assimilated to each other by the 13th century.
Many Kankali warriors joined the Khwarezmid Empire in the 11th century. They suffered heavy losses from Genghis Khan in 1219-1223. For example, Kankalis in Bukhara who were higher than a wheel were all slain. Jochi subdued their relations who still lived along the land of Kyrghyz and Kipchak steppes in 1225. Khwarizmi Kankali remnants submitted to Great Khan Ögedei after the long resistance under Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu against his general Chormaqan and governor Chin-temur. After the Mongol conquest, the remaining Kankalis were absorbed into other Turks and Mongols. Some of them who served in the Yuan Dynasty became Kharchins.
There are Kankali clans among the Kazakhs, the Uzbegs, the Nogais and the Karakalpaks.

Trading strategy index

Strategy indices are indices that track the performance of an algorithmic trading strategy. The algorithm clearly and transparently specifies all the actions that must be taken.
The following are examples of algorithms that strategies can be based on.
1) "Pairs trading strategy". This strategy examines pairs of instruments that are known to be statistically correlated. For example, consider Shell and Exxon. Both are oil stocks and are likely to move together. Knowledge of this trend creates an opportunity for profit, as on the occasions when these stocks break correlation for an instant, the trader may buy one and short sell the other at a premium.
2) "Fed funds curve strategy" This strategy takes a view on the shape of the curve based on the actions of the Fed. In this strategy, one puts on a steepener or flattener, based on whether the Federal Reserve has cut the benchmark rate or raised it. This is based on the conventional wisdom that the curve steepens when the rate is expected to be cut, and vice versa.
3) "Implied volatility against realized volatility ". In a number of markets such as commodities and rates, the implied volatility, as implied by straddle prices is higher than the realized volatility of the underlying forward. One way to 'exploit' this is to sell a short expiry (e.g. 1 month) straddle and delta-hedging it until it is alive. The strategy makes money if at expiry, the sum of the premium received (and accrued at money market), the (negative) final value of the straddle and the (positive/negative) value of the forwards (entered into to delta-hedge the straddle) is greater than zero. A variation of this, and more common solution in equity, is to sell either a one-month or three-month variance swap – usually on the Eurostoxx 50E or S&P500 index – that pays a positive performance if the implied volatility (strike of the swap) is above the realised volatility at expiry; in this case there is no need to delta-hedging the underlying movements.
Selling strategy indices.
These indices have been sold under the following premises, which need not be always true,
1. They offer a new asset class that is uncorrelated to conventional asset classes such as equities, bonds and commodities.
2. Compared to hedgefunds and mutual funds, these strategies are very transparent and the client can buy them only if they like the idea behind the strategy.
3. Some types of strategies also benefit from accounting reasons, for instance, in Germany, Notes linked to interest rates can be issued in the Schuldshein format. This enables interest rate linked strategies to be issued as Schuldsheins.
Trades that can be structured on these indices.
1. Asset Side: These trades are usually structured for institutional clients looking to invest their money in a different asset class. A typical trade would involve leveraged returns on an index with a floor on the performance.
2. Liability Side: These trades are aimed at corporate clients, such as mid size companies and banks looking for ways to service their loans. A typical trade involves the corporate client paying Fixed – Leverage*Index Performance and receiving Libor + Spread to service their loan. More recent trades entail the client paying a fixed rate below the fair interest rate swap and receiving an index designed to replicate the Libor (e.g. MMI by Deutsche Bank) – such a saving for the client (interest rate swap – fixed rate) is due to the lower forwards implied by the index (by construction) and the client bearing any potential basis risk (difference between index and Libor).
Financial institutions that have bought these products.
Several Institutional clients and mid-cap corporates have purchased products based on these strategies. Some major clients include:
Kaupthing (the now nationalized Icelandic bank)
Landsbanki (the now nationalized Icelandic bank)
Pension funds in Germany and Netherlands such as NAEV and Shell
Metro Lisbon
Bancaja of Spain
Financial institutions selling these products.
A number of major investment banks have dedicated strategy index teams or are looking to establish one. These desks usually work under the exotic derivatives umbrella at each bank. As a result, it is difficult to establish exactly how much strategy index trading generates at each bank.
Deutsche Bank is generally considered the leader in this business, with Barclays, RBS, Lehman (Now Nomura), Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and UBS all looking to quickly establish themselves.
Considering that it is possible to charge up to 1.5–2.0% annually on these trades, with the usual charge being 1% running, the revenues on a typical 5-year strategy trade are 5–10 times that of a conventional exotic trade.
Disadvantages and pitfalls.
Like other financial products, strategies that involve trading strategy indices have burnt the fingers of many a pension fund and small bank. The simplest argument against these strategies would be this: If the strategy is expected to be very profitable, the only eyes that it would catch would be the proprietary desks of these investment banks. For example, the fed funds curve strategy actually ends up being behind the curve as it takes action based on what the fed has already done – this implies that the steepening has already occurred.
However, such argument can hold true for everything a bank is willing to trade. A more serious issue is the danger that past backtested performance is simply the result of data-snooping – especially when signals are plentiful and difficult to justify on economic grounds (e.g. moving averages crossing signals).

An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba

An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba is a Grammy Award-winning 1965 album by Harry Belafonte and Miriam Makeba. It was the second outcome of the long lasting collaboration between Belafonte and Makeba, the first being the appearance of Makeba in the song "Just One More Dance" on Belafonte's 1960 album, "Belafonte Returns to Carnegie Hall". 
Despite the title, the album is not a collection of live duet performances by Harry Belafonte and Makeba. It is a studio album of 12 tracks, five by Belafonte, five by Makeba, and two duets. The songs are all South African traditional tunes sung in tribal languages like Xhosa and Zulu. 
In the mid-1960s, Belafonte was very active in supporting emerging African artists as well as making African music known worldwide, and this album is an example of this activity. It includes classical African songs like "Malaika" (with the English title "My Angel") as well as songs in African languages such as Zulu, Sotho and Swahili.

Engin Çeber (May 5, 1979 – October 8, 2008) was a Turkish human rights activist who was tortured and killed while in police custody. In 2012, twelve prison guards and officials received prison sentences in connection with this death, causing Amnesty International to call it a "landmark case".
Çeber was arrested in 2008 after he criticized authorities for not investigating or punishing police officers for the shooting and paralyzing of a left-wing activist. He was sent to a prison in Istanbul, where he was severely beaten. After complaining to his lawyer, he was sent to a hospital, where he fell into a coma, dying of a brain hemorrhage on October 8. Amnesty International criticized Turkey's human rights record arguing that the death is "further proof that torture and ill-treatment are rife in places of detention in Turkey", despite the government "zero-tolerance" against torture. Shortly after Çeber's death, Mehmet Ali Sahin, Turkey's justice minister apologized and announced that 19 officials were suspended pending investigation.
In October 2011, four officials received life sentences for their role in Ceber's death. However, this verdict was overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeals, which ruled that the sharing of a lawyer by the defendants had interfered with their right to a free trial. Sixty defendants were then retried. In the verdict of the second case on 2 October 2012, two prison guards and their supervisor were convicted of having tortured Çeber to death and given life sentences. Nine other officials also received prison sentences for their roles. Amnesty International hailed the verdict as "a historic moment for justice in the country".

History.
Vidin-Progresul is a new area built over the existing neighborhood in the mid-to-late 1970s. Old houses have been demolished and new buildings, block-houses, have been erected instead. The large majority of the new inhabitants used to work on "Progresul" (nowadays called "Promex") industrial plant. Not all the old neighborhood was demolished, part of it still exists today near the main road "Calea Galati".
Population.
Many of the people living here are old inhabitants, newcomers are in large majority peasants that were trained in professional schools to cope with industrial working requirements. The newcomers used to commute from their villages to Braila to get to work, but settled here as soon as the new block-houses have been finished.

The Assaye battle honour was awarded by the Governor General of British India to all East India Company battalions and British Army regiments that took part of the Battle of Assaye. The battle occurred on 23 September 1803, near the village of Assaye in western India where a small force under the command of Major General Arthur Wellesley defeated a 50,000 strong army of the Maratha Confederacy. The British and native troops (which consisted of Madras Line only) were awarded the battle honour "Assaye" with the device of Elephant vide General Order of Governor General dated 30 October 1803. The British regiments and Madras battalions involved were also presented with an honorary colour to mark their achievement. The Madras Battalions celebrated the victory for over a century till their disbandment in the 1920s. 
Of the sepoy battalions which faced the Maratha line, the only surviving battalion is the 1st Battalion, the Punjab Regiment of the Pakistan Army, the erstwhile 1st/1st Madras Infantry [http://orbat.com/site/history/open1/pakistan_punjabregt.html].
In the Indian Army only the Madras Sappers have this unique battle honour now but it counts as repugnant.

<doc id="19786473" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19786473" title="Italian Eritreans">
Italian Eritreans

Italian Eritreans (or Eritrean Italians) are Eritrean-born descendants of Italian settlers as well as Italian long-term residents in Eritrea.
History.
Their ancestry dates back from the beginning of the Italian colonization of Eritrea at the end of the 19th century, but only after the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935 they settled in large numbers. In the 1939 census of Eritrea there were more than 75,000 Eritrean Italians, most of them (53,000) living in Asmara. Many Italian settlers got out of their colony after its conquest by the Allies in November 1941 and they were reduced to only 38,000 by 1946. This also includes a population of mixed Italian and Eritrean descent; most Italian Eritreans still living in Eritrea are from this mixed group.
Although many of the remaining Italians stayed during the decolonization process after World War II and are actually assimilated to the Eritrean society, a few are stateless today, as none of them were given citizenship unless through marriage or, more rarely, by having it conferred upon them by the State.
The Italian colony of Eritrea.
From 1882 to 1941 Eritrea was ruled by the Kingdom of Italy. In those sixty years Eritrea was populated - mainly in the area of Asmara - by groups of Italian colonists, who moved there from the beginning of the 20th century.
The Italian Eritreans grew from 4,000 during World War I to nearly 100,000 at the beginning of World War II.
The Italians brought to Eritrea a huge development of Catholicism and by the 1940 nearly half the Eritrean population was Catholic, mainly in Asmara where many churches were built.
Italian administration of Eritrea brought improvements in the medical and agricultural sectors of Eritrean society. For the first time in history the Eritrean poor population had access to sanitary and hospital services in the urban areas. 
Furthermore, the Italians employed many Eritreans in public service (in particular in the police and public works departments) and oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa. In a region marked by cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity, a succession of Italian governors maintained a notable degree of unity and public order. The Italians also built many major infrastructural projects in Eritrea, including the Asmara-Massawa Cableway and the Eritrean Railway.
Benito Mussolini's rise to power in Italy in 1922 brought profound changes to the colonial government in Eritrea.
Mussolini established the Italian Empire in May 1936. The fascists imposed harsh rule that stressed the political and racial superiority of Italians. Eritreans were demoted to menial positions in the public sector in 1938.
Eritrea was chosen by the Italian government to be the industrial center of the Italian East Africa. The Italian government continued to implement agricultural reforms but primarily on farms owned by Italian colonists (exports of coffee boomed in the thirties). In the area of Asmara there were in 1940 more than 2000 small and medium sized industrial companies, concentrated in the areas of construction, mechanics, textiles, electricity and food processing. Consequently, the living standard of life in Eritrea in 1939 was considered one of the best of Africa for the Italian colonists and for the Eritreans.
The Mussolini government regarded the colony as a strategic base for future aggrandizement and ruled accordingly, using Eritrea as a base to launch its 1935–1936 campaign to colonize Ethiopia. In 1939 nearly 40% of the male Eritreans able to fight were enrolled in the colonial Italian Army: the best Italian colonial troops during World War II were the Eritrean Ascari, as stated by Italian Marshall Rodolfo Graziani and legendary officer Amedeo Guillet.
Asmara development.
Asmara was populated by a numerous Italian community and the city acquired an Italian architectural look.
Today Asmara is worldwide known for its early 20th-century Italian buildings, including the Art Deco Cinema Impero, "Cubist" Africa Pension, eclectic Orthodox Cathedral and former Opera House, the futurist Fiat Tagliero Building, neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic Cathedral, and the neoclassical Governor's Palace. The city is littered with Italian colonial villas and mansions. Most of central Asmara was built between 1935 and 1941, so effectively the Italians designed and enabled the local Eritrean population to build almost an entire city, in just six years.
The city of Asmara had a population of 98,000, of which 53,000 were Italians according to the Italian census of 1939. This fact made Asmara the main "Italian town" of the Italian empire in Africa. In all Eritrea the Italians were 75,000 in that year.[http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/italiani/elenco.htm]
Many industrial investments were done by the Italians in the area of Asmara and Massawa, but the beginning of World War II stopped the blossoming industrialization of Eritrea.
When the British army conquered Eritrea from the Italians in spring 1941, most of the infrastructures and the industrial areas were extremely damaged and the remaining ones (like the Asmara-Massawa Cableway) were successively removed and sent toward India and British Africa as a war booty.
The following Italian guerrilla war was supported by many Eritrean colonial troops until the Italian armistice in September 1943. Eritrea was placed under British military administration after the Italian surrender in World War II.
The Italians in Eritrea started to move away from the country after the defeat of the Kingdom of Italy by the Allies, and Asmara in the British census of 1949 already had only 17,183 Italian Eritreans on a total population of 127,579. Most Italian settlers left for Italy, with others to United States, Middle East, and Australia.
After WWII.
The British maintained initially the Italian administration of Eritrea, but the country soon started to be involved in a violent process of independence (from the British in the late forties and after 1952 from the Ethiopians, who annexed Eritrea in that year).
During the last years of World War II Dr. Vincenzo Di Meglio defended politically the Italians of Eritrea and successively promoted the independence of Eritrea.
After the war he was named Director of the "Commitato Rappresentativo Italiani dell' Eritrea" (CRIE). In 1947 supported the creation of the ""Associazione Italo-Eritrei"" and the ""Associazione Veterani Ascari"", in order to get alliance with the Eritreans favorable to Italy in Eritrea.
As a result of these creations, he cofounded the ""Partito Eritrea Pro Italia"" (Party of Shara Italy) in September 1947, an Eritrean political Party favorable to the Italian presence in Eritrea that obtained more than 200,000 inscriptions of membership in one single month.
Indeed the Italian Eritreans strongly rejected the Ethiopian annexation of Eritrea after the war: the Party of Shara Italy was established in Asmara in 1947 and the majority of the members were former Italian soldiers with many Eritrean Ascari (the organization was even backed up by the government of Italy). The main objective of this party was Eritrea freedom, but they had a pre-condition that stated that before independence the country should be governed by Italy for at least 15 years (like happened with Italian Somalia).
Since then the Eritrean Italians have diminished as a community and now are reduced to a few hundreds, mainly located in the capital Asmara. Actually the most renowned of them in Eritrea is the professional cyclist Domenico Vaccaro, who won in Asmara the last stage of the Tour of Eritrea in April 2008.
Language and religion.
Most Italian Eritreans can speak Italian, as their language is still widely understood and spoken by many Eritreans of other ethnic and racial groups: there is only one remaining Italian-language school in Asmara, renowned in Eritrea for its sports activities. Italian is still spoken in commerce in Eritrea.
Until 1975, there were in Asmara an Italian Lyceum, an Italian Technical Institute, an Italian Middle school and special university courses in Medicine done held by Italian teachers.
Gino Corbella, an Italian consul in Asmara, estimated that the diffusion of the Italian language in Eritrea was supported even by the fact that in 1959, nearly 20,000 Eritreans were descendants of Italians who had illegitimate sons/daughters with Eritrean women during colonial times.
Italian Eritreans can also speak the country's "de facto" official languages Tigrinya, Arabic, and English. The assimilated Italian Eritreans of the new generations (in 2007 they numbered nearly 900 persons) speak Tigrinya and only a bit of Italian or speak Italian as second language.
Nearly all are Roman Catholic Christians, while some are converts to other sects of Christianity.

Zero consonant

A zero consonant, silent initial, or null-onset letter is a consonant letter that does not correspond to a consonant sound, but indicates that a word or syllable starts with a vowel (i.e. has a null onset). Some abjads, abugidas, and alphabets have zero consonants, generally because they have an orthographic rule that all syllables must begin with a consonant letter, whereas the language they transcribe allows syllables to start with a vowel. However, in a few cases, such as Pahawh Hmong below, the lack of a consonant letter represents a specific consonant sound, so the lack of a consonant sound requires a distinct letter to disambiguate.

Animation (album)

Animation is the third solo album by Yes founder-member and former lead singer Jon Anderson, released in 1982.
"Animation" was recorded during a busy time for Anderson. At the time, he was collaborating with Vangelis and Mike Oldfield and exploring new age and electronic pop. As with the previous album, "Song of Seven", several well-known musicians were involved in "Animation", including Simon Phillips, David Sancious and Jack Bruce. "All in a Matter of Time" was released as a single. The album was promoted with a world tour where Anderson would perform songs from the album as well as several Yes classics, mostly in medley form. A follow-up album entitled "Chagall" was recorded but never released.
"Animation" was released on vinyl, but no CD version was published until 2006, when a limited edition CD re-release of the album (with two bonus tracks) was issued by Opio Media. It was produced by producer Tony Visconti who had worked with more mainstream British acts such as David Bowie and "T. Rex".
One of the tracks of the album, "Boundaries", would later appear on other works by Anderson (entitled "O'er", on "The Promise Ring"), and Yes (entitled '"Somehow, Someday", on "Open Your Eyes").
Performers.

Surrender (song).
""I wasn't aiming for it, but this always was a radio song. Frankly, it still could be. Stefano Cerri's wonderful bass lines really set the piece and propel it forward so pure. It's about getting rid of fear and war. Having a big fireworks display to celebrate after we succeed. Ridding the world of war how wonderful that we be.""

TTT Riga

TTT Rīga is the name of a professional women's basketball club based in Riga, Latvia. "TTT" means Tram and Trolley Trust. Team held its first official game on 5 November 1958. Next 25 years are known as the "First Golden age" of the club. Internationally club was known also as "Daugava Riga", in fact Daugava was predecessor of TTT Riga in 1950s.
History.
Led by famous Latvian basketball player and coach Olgerts "Bohums" Altbergs, TTT Riga conquered its first European title in 1960, winning the European Cup for Women's Champion Clubs (since 1992 known as Euroleague Women). Dzidra Uztupe-Karamiseva, Vita Silina-Luka (Karpova), Dzintra Kiepe-Baka and other outstanding players of the time bring women basketball to new levels. Seventeen more European titles were added during next 22 years – achievement unequalled until this day.
Rise of Uljana (Juliana) Semjonova, joining TTT Riga in 1965, at the age of 13, confirmed golden status of „TTT". From 1964 to 1975 TTT earned 12 consecutive European titles. In 18 seasons of international competition Uljana Semjonova never lost a game in national team competition, a record that will almost certainly never be repeated.
Late 1980s and 1990s marked decline of once famous club. Best Latvian players, with Semojonova being the first one, continued their professional careers in France, Spain and Italy. It took ten years after Latvia regained independence, while TTT re-entered Liliana Ronchetti cup in 2001. Next entry followed only five years later.
Autumn of 2006 was a turning point in history of the club. New leadership and new management launched long term work to unite best Latvian players under the famous club name, first foreign internationals – like Brazilian and WNBA star Iziane Castro Marques – came to Latvia. In the spring of 2007 TTT Riga after one year silence regained Latvian title and applied for the participation in FIBA Euroleague Women. Season of 2007–2008 will be the 50th for the club.

Double line automatic signalling

Double Line Automatic Signalling is a form of railway signalling used on the majority of double line sections in New Zealand. Double Line Automatic Signalling uses track circuits to detect the presence of trains in sections broken up by intermediate signals. Usually there is an 'up' and a 'down' main line, and beyond station limits the lines are not bi-directionally signalled.
Junctions or points.
At junctions or points, one of or both mains signals are usually controlled either remotely (by a Train Controller or Signalmen) or switched in at a local panel.
Sidings.
Sidings off one or both mains are usually operated by switchlock lever points secured by padlock and track circuit presence that enables a release to be given before points can be operated.

U.S. Trust

U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (formerly known as U.S. Trust Corporation) was founded in 1853 as the United States Trust Company of New York.  It operated independently until 2000 when it was acquired by Charles Schwab, and Co. and subsequently was sold to, and became a subsidiary of Bank of America in 2007. U.S. Trust provides investment management, wealth structuring and credit and lending services to clients.
History.
U.S. Trust was founded in 1853 and chartered by the State of New York. It is the first and oldest trust company in the United States. The venture was backed by a group of wealthy men who invested $1 million in the company, at the time named "United States Trust Company of New York". The inaugural board of trustees included thirty prominent New Yorkers. Among the founding investors were Joseph Lawrence of the Bank of the State of New York and then Mayor of New York who was appointed president, and John Aikman Stewart of the United States Life Insurance Company of New York who assumed the role of Secretary. Other founders included inventor, philanthropist and industrialist Peter Cooper, department store founder Marshall Field and railroad developer and iron and steel manufacturer Erastus Corning. 
Adding Services.
U.S. Trust was created as a financial company to serve both institutions and individuals by acting as executor and trustee of their funds. At a time when trusts were rare, the concept was innovative. By 1886 the company had established itself as a reputable and stable financial institution. 
In the mid-1800s, U.S. Trust had a list of wealthy clients and played a role in major construction projects including railroads and the Panama Canal. Many of the company’s corporate clients issued securities to finance these initiatives, allowing U.S. Trust to serve as corporate trustee. The boom in industry and enterprise also helped to grow U.S. Trust's business in managing personal trusts. In the 1880s and 90s U.S. Trust clients included William Waldorf Astor, Jay Gould and Oliver Harriman. 
U.S. Trust withstood a number of financial crises throughout the latter half of the 1800s and into the 1900s. By 1928 it had more than $1 billion in trusted assets and led competitors by a considerable margin. An emphasis on stability helped it navigate the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent depression. The company began to introduce more personalized services including advising clients on schools and careers for their children. In 1958 U.S. Trust launched its first advertisements in society pages of newspapers, The New Yorker and the programs of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic Society. 
Restructuring in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.
U.S. Trust continued to grow through the 1960s and into the early 1970s. By 1965, 85% of the company’s gross income was coming from trust and investment operations and estate administration. Banking operations emerged as an opportunity and the firm began selling investment services to banks and insurance companies, helping them manage their growing deposits. This shift had a large impact on U.S. Trust and by 1977 banking made up 50% of the company’s earnings. 
By the latter half of the 1970s, profits had declined and despite efforts to expand the firm’s physical footprint, it lost large pension fund clients due to poor performance and an incident where municipal bond certificates worth $397 million disappeared from its vault. As a result, U.S. Trust stopped dealing in international lending, closed its Geneva and London branches and reduced privileges available to lower-asset-level clients (less than $2 million).
The 1980s represented a time of restructuring for U.S. Trust. This included the launch of a subsidiary, Financial Technologies International, to market and license computer software to financial institutions, the discontinuation of business and real estate lending and the sale of its commercial, industrial and real estate portfolios valued at $275 million. In 1986, U.S. Trust was ranked behind trust competitors in assets under management and trust income. In 1987 it dropped the account minimum from $1-2 million in liquid assets to $250,000. U.S. Trust expanded its geographic presence throughout the 1990s by opening new offices and acquiring others across the continental United States. 
Charles Schwab and Bank of America.
U.S. Trust was acquired in May of 2000 for $2.7 billion in stock, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Charles Schwab & Co. David Pottruck, CEO of Charles Schwab at the time, pursued the acquisition to broaden the firm’s wealth management platform and stop client outflow to bigger wealth management firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Efforts to integrate the exclusive U.S. Trust into the discount-broker Schwab yielded a culture clash that ultimately undermined the merger. Schwab agreed to sell U.S. Trust to Bank of America for $3.3 billion in cash in November 2006. The acquisition of U.S. Trust was completed in 2007 and significantly strengthened Bank of America’s position in the private banking business and its ability to cater to some of the nation's wealthiest clients. 
Services.
U.S. Trust offers resources and customized solutions to help meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, banking and credit needs. Clients are served by teams of advisors offering a range of financial services, including investment management, financial and succession planning, philanthropic and specialty asset management, family office services, custom credit solutions, financial administration and family trust stewardship.
Locations.
U.S. Trust headquarters is located at 114 West 47th Street, New York City, NY, United States. The company has over 100 offices in the United States in 31 states and Washington, D.C.

Grand Central Station was an American anthology radio series which had a long run on the major networks from 1937 to 1954. Produced by Himan Brown, Martin Horrell and others, the story content ranged from romantic comedies to lightweight dramas.
Each program opened with an announcer intoning that Grand Central was "the crossroads of a million private lives, a gigantic stage on which are played a thousand dramas daily."
Actors included Jim Ameche and Hume Cronyn. The announcers were George Baxter, Ken Roberts and Tom Shirley. The programs were narrated by Jack Arthur, Stuart Metz and Alexander Scourby. Ken Roberts died at 99 on June 19, 2009.
One sound effect frequently used in the program was a chugging steam train engine. Some listeners noted that steam engines no longer frequented the terminal, prompting Himan Brown to respond "You have your own Grand Central Station."

S-Tone Inc.

S-Tone Inc. is multi-instrumentalist jazz musician Stefano Tirone's main musical project. Originating from Milan, Italy, Tirone has been a professional musician for over twenty years. The first official S-tone Inc. recording was released in 1992 during the acid jazz era, a formative time for Tirone, who was heavily influenced by the combination of soul, jazz and Latin rhythms of the period. He started playing music in the early 1980s during the new wave period. He graduated in architecture from Politecnico di Milano university and currently alternates between the two pofessions of architect and musician, though he has reportedly given priority to the latter in more recent years.
He has studied guitar and later piano for a certain period with Sonny Taylor (Mayafra Combo) and Antonio Zambrini, two pianists who have opened his mind towards new harmonic horizons. The activity as a producer starts in 1990 together with the dj Valenti with whom he has released the track "What's up" under the name Baby Doll House with the label Irma. From 1992 to 1994 he has collaborated with dj Don Carlos with whom he has created two projects, Montego Bay and Antigua Managua, which were based on 1970s disco samples with a house feel. In 1993 he participates to the compilation "Totally Wired Italia" released by the English label Acid Jazz with a track under the name Square Circle. Since 1994 he works for the labels of Luciano Cantone and Davide Rosa, the founders of Schema records, first with Milano 2000 and then with Schema from 2001. 
The first S-Tone Inc. album was released in 1996 with the name "Love unlimited" and it contains in particular the track "Ainda sonhar" which has been chosen for dozens of compilations all over the world. In 1997 with the name Cosmorama he releases a monothematic album inspired by drum&bass, yet jazzy and soulful. In 1999 he releases the second S-Tone Inc. album, "Free spirit". But it's with the album "Sobrenatural" released in 2002 that Stefano Tirone proves to have established his own style, made of various influences that go from Brazilian music, to jazz, funky and soul, without forgetting his experience in house music. In 2003 he produces a 12" with Stefano Ghittoni, of The Dining Rooms, under the name Vuca . One of these tracks, "Bossafrica", has been later re-recorded during the sessions of the fourth S-Tone Inc. album. 
In 2004 he produced the album "Instalaçao do samba" for the Brazilian songwriter Tomaz Di Cunto who has chosen the name Toco for his project. During 2003 and 2004 he has written and produced the tracks of his fourth album "Luz y Sombra", that has a more acoustic vein and features many musicians from the Milan jazz scene, plus five Brazilians. In particular the vocal guests are Laura Fedele, Toco, Manuela Ravaglioli, Adi Souza, Angie Brown and Luciana Cury from São Paulo. Also it features a string quartet in two tracks. In November 2005 he has produced in Rio de Janeiro the second album of Toco titled "Outro lugar", with the participation of Roberto Menescal (bossa nova pioneer with Jobim and Gilberto) on guitar and some of the best Brazilian sidemen. The recordings have been completed in Milan during spring/summer 2006 and it has been released on Schema records in February 2007.
In April 2009 Schema records release his fifth album "Moon in libra" which includes new and old collaborations and a more intense approach to songwriting and producing. The album includes two cover versions, one of the popular "Stormy" revisited in a bossa nova mood and "My only man" by Italian composer Piero Umiliani and formerly sung by Helen Merrill.
Occasionally S-Tone Inc. have played live with various guests. He also has selected records in radio programs and clubs.

Marlin (car)

Marlin is a British sports car manufacturer founded in 1979 in Plymouth as Marlin Engineering and now located in Crediton, Devon England.
The company was founded by Paul Moorhouse, who, after building a series of one off cars for his own use decided to put one into production as a kit car. The first kits were sold in 1979.
The first product was the Roadster which remained in the line up until sold, along with the Berlinetta, to Yorkshire Kit Cars (YKC) in 1992 who kept them in production until the owner retired in 2006 and sold them on to Aquila Sports Cars Ltd.
In the mid 1990s the company was sold to Terry and Mark Matthews who introduced the Hunter model.
Marlin Roadster.
The Roadster was the original car and was based around Triumph Herald components. The two seat body built of aluminium and glass fibre had a radiator grille slightly similar to pre-war Alfa Romeo sports cars. In 1981 the Morris Marina became the donor car replacing the Triumph and the Marina engine became standard although many customers fitted engines, gearboxes and back axles of their own choice. Fitted with the two-litre inline-six from a late Triumph Vitesse, a top speed of was achievable.
Berlinetta.
The Berlinetta was launched in 1982 version using Ford Cortina Mk III or IV parts.
Of those who had bought Roadsters originally, some now wanted more room for offspring and partners who also wanted to enjoy the fun of the Marlin. So 1982 saw the introduction of the Ford Cortina (later, Sierra) based Berlinettas as a 2+2 coupé. This came complete with previously unheard of luxuries such as wind-up windows, a lockable boot and a hardtop option. A touring car rather than a sports car, sales of the car were fewer than the Roadster, mainly due to the more limited market for such a car.
Cabrio.
The 1991 Cabrio was an updated Roadster based on Ford Sierra parts.
Hunter.
Based on the Cabrio the Hunter was a complete, factory built car.
Sportster.
The Sportster is the latest in the Roadster line but completely updated with the BMW E36 six cylinder engine as standard. It is available as a kit or fully built.
5EXi.
As a complete change from the retro looks of the previous models, the 5EXi is a modern two seat, mid engined sports car using Honda Civic, Rover K-series engines or Audi 1.8T engine . The car is built up around a space frame on which are fastened glass fibre body panels.
It is available as a kit or fully built. It is claimed by the factory that the kit can be assembled in 100 hours

Thai–Laotian Border War

The Thai–Laotian Border War (December 1987 – February 1988) was a short confrontation between Thai and Laotian forces. It was caused by a dispute involving the map made by French surveyors in 1907 to mark the borders between Siam and French Indochina in the southern Luang Prabang Range mountain area. Ownership of the village of Ban Romklao on the border of Phitsanulok Province and three small border villages on the edge of Uttaradit Province was left unclear. (This is the same map underlying the Cambodian–Thai border dispute. The agreed factor in determining ownership was the natural watershed, but the French map makers at times ignored this.)
A series of minor shooting incidents had occurred between Thai and Laotian forces in 1984. In December 1987, however, Thai armed forces occupied the disputed village of Ban Romklao, raising the Thai flag over it. The government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic protested strongly, insisting the village was part of Botèn district of Xaignabouli province. Thailand replied that the village belonged to Chat Trakan district ("amphoe") of Phitsanulok Province. Pathet Lao forces staged a night attack on the small Thai garrison, driving the Thai soldiers from the village and replacing the Thai flag with that of the Lao PDR. Serious fighting followed, continuing for weeks until a cease-fire was declared on February 19, 1988.
The brief war claimed a total of about 1,000 casualties, the Thais suffering more heavily since for much of the war they were attacking entrenched Laotian positions. Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was the commander of the Royal Thai Army at the time of the war and was criticized for engaging in it against the wishes of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vietnam had assisted its communist ally, sending troops from the Second Vietnamese Infantry Division to Baan Nakok air field in Xaignabouli to support the Laotian military operations, amidst the border clashes with Thailand along the Thai–Cambodian border.
Aftermath.
The Thai-Lao Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) was established in 1996 to clarify the 1,810-kilometre boundary and settle ownership of the disputed villages. Border demarcation is still going on.

Derek Lewin (born May 18, 1930) is a former amateur international footballer. He spent most of his playing career with Bishop Auckland scoring for them in each of their FA Amateur Cup finals at Wembley in 1955, 1956 and 1957. He also won five English Amateur international caps, and represented Great Britain in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. 
In 1953, his talent attracted the eyes of the Oldham Athletic player manager George Hardwick who persuaded him to sign amateur forms. Although he found little time to train with his professional colleagues due to pressure of work in his family's business, his natural ability served the club well. He scored the only goal on his debut at Lincoln City in September, when the club recorded a rare win in what proved to be a very disappointing 1953-54 season, and went on to make a further eight Second Division appearances. 
In 1958 following the crash at Munich Airport involving Manchester United, Derek brought Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley to Old Trafford to assist the club through the problems of meeting their fixtures. In 1970 Derek became a director of Blackpool FC. He is now a Life Past President of Lancashire Football Association. He rose to President of this Association. He joined the Association in 1972 as a Council member. He was a Vice-President from 1985–95 and President from 1995-2004 when he became Life Past President. In 1991 he was elected to represent Lancashire County on the Council of the Football Association and he served this national body until 2006. Still actively involved in Lancashire FA, Derek is a member of the Board of Directors. He lives with his wife Sheila in Chorley.

Lake Venado

Lake Venado is an endorheic lake located at the foot of Mount Apo in the province of North Cotabato, Mindanao, Philippines. It is the highest lake in the country, found in coordinates 7°00′8″N 125°16′10″E, with an estimated surface elevation of 7,200 feet (2,194 m above sea level). The lake is fed by local run-off and there is no outflow from the lake. The lake usually loses two-thirds of its size during dry months due to evaporation.
The name of the lake comes from the Spanish word ""venado"", which means "deer," owing to the deer-like shape of the lake. However, the local people living in the area called the lake ""linaw"", a Cebuano term for "clear", because the water of the lake is crystal-clear reflecting the peak of Mount Apo. The lake is believed to be enchanted by spirits living in the lake, according to the local tribes people.
The vicinity of the lake is a popular camping site for Filipino mountaineers en route to and coming down from the peak of Mount Apo, the Philippines' highest mountain. In 2007, a Filipino mountaineer coming down from the peak of Mount Apo, drowned in the lake.

The festival has been named after the Norwegian author and Nobel laureate Sigrid Undset who lived in Lillehammer between 1919 and her death in 1949.Oppland county municipality has provided support for the festival since its inception.

David Irving controversy in 2008/2009.
In October 2008 a controversy erupted over the invitation to controversial historian and Holocaust denier David Irving to speak at the 2009 festival. Several of Norway's most distinguished authors protested the invitation. Leader of the board for the festival, Jesper Holte, defended the invitation by stating that "Our agenda is to invite a liar and a falsifier of history to a festival about truth. And confront him with this". Irving has been invited to discuss his concept of "truth" ""in light of his activity as a writer of historical books and the many accusations he has been exposed to as a consequence of this."" Although Irving is introduced in the festival's webpages as "historian and writer" the board chair leader defended the more aggressive language being used to characterize Irving in connection with the controversy that had arisen. Lars Saabye Christensen and Roy Jacobsen were two authors who had threatened to boycott the festival on account of Irving's invitation and Anne B. Ragde stated that Sigrid Undset would have turned around in her grave. As the festival has as its subsidiary name "Sigrid Undset Days", a representative of Undset's family had requested that the name of the Nobel laureate be removed in connection with the festival. Also the Norwegian free speech organization Fritt Ord was critical towards letting Irving speak at the festival and had requested that its logo be removed from the festival. In addition Edvard Hoem announced that he would not attend the 2009 festival with Irving taking part. Per Edgar Kokkvold, leader of the Norwegian Press Confederation advocated cancelling Irving's invitation.
In a matter of days after the controversy had started, the invitation was rescinded. This led to the resignation of Stig Sæterbakken from his position as content director as he was the person who had invited Irving. The head of the festival, Randi Skeie, deplored what had taken place, stating "Everything is fine as long as everyone agrees, but things get more difficult when one doesn't like the views being put forward." Sæterbakken characterized his colleagues as "damned cowards" arguing that they were walking in lockstep.
According to editor-in-chief Sven Egil Omdal of "Stavanger Aftenblad" the opposition to Irving's participation at the festival appeared as a concerted effort and Omdal suggested campaign journalism from two of Norway's largest newspapers, "Dagbladet" and "Aftenposten" and Norway's public service broadcaster NRK.
David Irving commented that he had not been told that the festival was going to present him as a liar, and that he was preparing a lecture about the real history of what took place in Norway during World War II, contrary to what official historians have presented. Irving stated that he had thought the Norwegian people to be made of tougher stuff.
Only days after the cancellation David Irving announced that he would go to Lillehammer during the literature festival and deliver his 2-hour lecture from a hotel room.
Other cultural festivals in Lillehammer.
Other cultural festivals in Lillehammer following the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics are DølaJazz Lillehammer Jazzfestival, and the Amandus Festival, the latter being a festival for young Norwegian filmmakers.

Johannes Aavik

Johannes Aavik ( in Randvere, Laimjala Parish, Saare County – 18 March 1973 in Stockholm) was an Estonian philologist and Fennophile who played a significant role in the modernization and development of the Estonian language.
Education and career.
Aavik studied history at the University of Tartu and the University of Nezin in 1905. He was a member of the Young Estonia movement and obtained a Doctorate in romance languages at the University of Helsinki in 1910. Aarvik taught Estonian and French at Tartu University between 1926 to 1933. In 1934 he was appointed by the Estonian Ministry of Education as a consultant and inspector of schools. He fled Soviet occupation in 1944 and lived in Stockholm for the remainder of his life.
Estonian language development.
Johannes Aavik found that Estonian, which had for centuries been the language of peasants, needed innovation, as its sphere of usage widened rapidly with the emergence of a modern nation. There was a need for standardization of grammar and orthography as well as new technical terminology. Aavik added that the language also needed to be versatile and euphonic. In 1912 he started writing articles to literary journals, making propositions how to develop Estonian language. He suggested intensive borrowing from Finnish; many of his suggestions were quickly widely accepted and have become part of standard Estonian vocabulary. From 1914 he started to artificially create well sounding new word stems to replace awkward compound words. Thus he proposed "relv" (’weapon’) instead of "sõjariist" (literally ’war tool’), "roim" (’crime’) instead of "kuritöö" (’evil deed’) and "veenma" (’convince’) instead of "uskuma panema" (’make believe’). He generally tried to avoid the sounds t and s and preferred shorter words to longer ones. He also favoured o in successive syllables to u, as is common in the South Estonian dialects.
Aavik tried to modernize even the grammar. He advocated the usage of i-plural instead of t(d)-plural ("keelis" pro "keeltes") and the i-superlative instead of the ordinary superlative ("suurim" pro "kõige suurem"), as well as –nd instead of –nud in active past participle. He proposed inflexional affixes to the ma-infinitive, but only some of them entered into popular usage. He also tried to introduce a future form of verbs and a female personal pronoun, but these got little positive response.
Aavik published numerous essays and translations to propagate his ideas; he had vocal supporters as well as opponents. In 1919, he published a dictionary of 2000 novelty words. His principles (utility, aesthetics and native quality) were summarized in "Keeleuuenduse äärmised võimalused" (Extreme Perspectives of Language Innovation; Tartu, 1924).
Language innovation slowly died away after the 1927 act that made it compulsory for schools to teach standard Estonian as put down in Estonian Orthographic Dictionary (1925, chief editor J. V. Veski) and Estonian Grammar (by Elmar Muuk, 1927). However, some words proposed by Aavik and fallen into oblivion have been picked up and re-introduced by more recent literati.
An essay on linguistic innovation in Estonian by Paul Saagpakk can be found in his Estonian-English Dictionary.

Communications Data Bill 2008

The Communications Data Bill was intended to create powers to collect data concerning people's phone, e-mail and web-browsing habits for mass surveillance in the United Kingdom. The government database would have included telephone numbers dialed, the websites visited and addresses to which e-mails are sent but not the text of e-mails or recorded telephone conversations. 
Since October 2007 telecommunication companies have been required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for twelve months. The bill would have extended the coverage to Internet website visited, email messages, and VOIP data. 
Chris Huhne, Liberal Democrat Home affairs spokesman said at the time: "The government's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying."
The plans were not completed during the Labour administration, but intentions to gain access to more communications data lived on under the coalition elected in 2010 as the Communications Capabilities Development Programme run by the Home Office's Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism. In 2012, a new Draft Communications Data Bill was published.

Forming out of an area of low pressure associated with a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline, Arlene tracked in a general eastward direction across the Atlantic Ocean, taking an erratic track with several curves. On August 13, the storm brushed Bermuda as a weak tropical storm before continuing out to sea. On August 20, the storm briefly stalled before becoming a hurricane two days later. Early on August 24, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the far north Atlantic before curving southeast and dissipating near the Iberian Peninsula on August 26.
In Bermuda, Arlene produced winds up to and waves up to ; however, little damage resulted from the storm. Offshore, a blind man was undertaking a challenge to become the first blind man to cross the Atlantic alone; he encountered rough seas and high winds from the storm, causing US$8,000 in damages to his ship over a two-day span. Between August 26 and 27, the remnants of the system produced heavy rains over portions of Western Europe.
Meteorological history.
Hurricane Arlene originated out of an area of low pressure associated with a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline on August 8. Tracking towards the southeast in a gradual anticyclonic loop, the system slowly increased in organization and intensity. By August 10, the low neared the Bahamas but remained disorganized. The following day, while located over Andros Island, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression, the third of the season, based on its appearance on satellite imagery.
Upon becoming a depression on August 10, the forward movement of the storm shifted to the northwest in response to an approaching trough off the Eastern United States and an elongated subtropical ridge to the south. The depression intensified into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC on August 11; however, operationally it was not upgraded until a reconnaissance mission by the hurricane hunters found flight-level winds of . The storm tracked towards Bermuda along a trough of low pressure in the Atlantic Ocean.
Throughout August 13, the proximity of Arlene to the trough prevented significant development. Around 1500 UTC, the center of Arlene tracked about north of Bermuda. Several hours later, a ship near the center of the storm reported winds; however, due to the disorganized presentation of the storm, these winds were not considered to be representative of Arlene's true intensity. Over the following several days, the storm tracked around several low pressure systems. By August 15, Arlene traveled southeast before re-curving to the northeast on August 18. The intensity of the storm also continuously fluctuated during this period peaking at and was as low as .
The northeast movement followed a passing short-wave trough on August 18; the forward motion of the storm also increased due to the trough. On August 20, the steering currents around Arlene collapsed, leading to the storm nearly stalling for 24 hours. During this period, the storm developed excellent outflow and intensified. Operationally, Arlene was upgraded to a hurricane at 2200 UTC on August 20 based on the appearance of an eye-feature on satellite imagery; however, post-storm analysis indicated that the storm did not attain hurricane-status until 0600 UTC on August 22. This occurred 14.5 days after its formation.
Upon attaining hurricane-status, Arlene rapidly tracked northward due to a strengthening area of high pressure near the Azores. Shortly after, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of 987 mbar (hPa). Continuing rapidly northward, the hurricane began to interact with a baroclinic zone over the cold waters of the north Atlantic. This resulted in the storm undergoing an extratropical transition which it completed by 0000 UTC on August 24. The extratropical remnants of the storm continued to track around the periphery of the high pressure system, turning towards the southeast the following day. By August 26, the storm became increasingly disorganized and hard to pinpoint on satellite imagery. The storm finally dissipated at 1800 UTC off the coast of Portugal that day.
Preparations and impact.
As Tropical Storm Arlene tracked towards Bermuda, residents on the island were advised to take precautions and board up their homes. This followed the issuance of a tropical storm advisory for the island. On August 12, Arlene produced squally weather throughout Bermuda as the outer bands impacted the region. Rainfall from the storm peaked at . A blind sailor was caught in the storm for two days while trying to become the first blind man to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone. On August 14, he encountered the full-force of the storm, seas and winds battered his foot-sloop called the "Eye Opener" while trying to dock in Bermuda. The forced docking at Bermuda cost the sailor roughly US$8,000 due to damages from the storm. On August 14, Arlene brushed Bermuda, producing torrential rains, rough seas and winds up to . The center of the storm remained far enough offshore that only minor damage occurred on the island. On August 26, the extratropical remnants of Arlene impacted Spain, bringing to Rota, surpassing the highest rainfall for the month of August set in 1971. The remnant moisture from Arlene continued through the Mediterranean Sea and produced heavy rains across Italy on August 27.

Henri Rivière (painter)

Henri Rivière (March 11, 1864 – August 24, 1951) was a French artist and designer best known for his creation of a form of shadow play at the "Chat Noir" cabaret, and for his post-Impressionist illustrations of Breton landscapes and the Eiffel Tower.
Early life.
Rivière was born in Paris. His father ran a haberdashery shop in the city. In 1870, fleeing from the advancing Prussians during the Franco-Prussian war, his father moved the family back to his childhood home in the Pyrenees. He died three years later and Rivière's mother returned to Paris and remarried. Rivière grew up in Paris, showing an early interest in art, especially Impressionism.
After a brief period working at an ostrich-feather importation business, Rivière signed on for formal training in art with the painter Emile Bin. From 1880, he was contributing illustrations to magazines and journals. 
Rivière soon became associated with the cabarets in Montmartre, especially the popular "Chat Noir" (Black Cat) café. From 1882, Rivière worked as part of the editorial team on the weekly "Chat Noir journal", which published light verse, short stories and illustrations. Rivière edited and contributed art and reviews to the journal until 1885.
Shadow plays.
In 1886 Rivière created a form of shadow theatre at the "Chat Noir" under the name "ombres chinoises". This was a notable success, lasting for a decade until the cafe closed in 1897. He used back-lit zinc cut-out figures which appeared as silhouettes. Rivière was soon joined by Caran d'Ache and other artists, initially performing d'Ache's drama "L’Epopee". From 1886 to 1896, Rivière created 43 shadow plays on a great variety of subjects from myth, history and the Bible. He collaborated with many different artists and writers, but made the illustrations for only 9 of the productions himself. He concentrated on improving the technical aspects of the production using enamelling and lighting to create extremely delicate effects of light and colour. The "Ombres" evolved into numerous theatrical productions and had a major influence on phantasmagoria. 
According to historians Phillip Cate and Mary Shaw, Rivière's work involved both aesthetic and technical innovations,
Essentially, Rivière created a system in which he placed silhouettes of figures, animals, elements of landscapes, and so forth, within a wooden framework at three distances from the screen: the closest created an absolutely black silhouette, and the next two created gradations of black to gray, thus suggesting recession into space. Silhouettes could be moved across the screen on runners within the frame.
Along with d'Ache's "L’Epopee", Rivière's own works "Le Temptation de Saint Antoine" (1887) and "La Marche a L'etoile" (1890), were the most successful and popular. Rivière's shadow theatre was the cabaret's greatest attraction and "played a crucial role in establishing the credibility of the cabaret with that other tier of the avant-garde, the Impressionists/Post Impressionists: Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet, Mary Cassatt, and others."
Prints.
Between 1882 and 1886 Rivière created a large number of etchings. He also showed an interest in photography, making a series of picturesque scenes of everyday life. He later experimented with colour woodcuts and chromolithography in the late 1880s. Rivière first visited Brittany in 1884, spending most of his summers there until 1916. Together with bustling Parisian life, rural Brittany constituted the majority of the subjects of his landscape works.
Rivière’s prints were generally intended to be published as collections. These include forty images used in "Breton Landscapes", created between 1890 and 1894. He also made colour woodcuts for "The Sea: Studies of Waves", and prepared other sequences that remained unfinished, including "36 Views of the Eiffel Tower", which were eventually published as lithographs. These were influenced by the vogue for Japonism at the time, modernising the famous prints by Hiroshige and Hokusai of "36 Views of Mount Fuji".
His colour lithographic series' include: 
Rivière ceased making prints in 1917, effectively retiring as a professional artist, but continued to work on watercolours in his later years. He died on August 24, 1951.

Bennett Smith

Bennett Smith (November 29, 1808 – January 11, 1886) was a shipbuilder and shipowner in Nova Scotia, Canada. Smith briefly served as a member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for Hants County in 1858 and 1859 as a Liberal member.
He was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, the son of John Smith and Ann Grant. He learned the craft of shipbuilding from his father, and he and his brothers inherited their father's shipyard, located on Smith's Island at the intersection of the Avon and St. Croix Rivers, in 1832. In the same year, Smith married Rachel Harris.
During the early 1840s, Smith was involved in farming and the timber trade but returned again to shipbuilding. He built 27 large ships involved in foreign trade, owning and operating all but one; he also owned shares in other vessels.
He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1858 following the death of Ichabod Dimock; he did not run for reelection in the general election the following year.
Smith's final Windsor-built ship, launched in May 1877 to great fanfare, was the full rigged, 1318 ton "Black Watch". The ship cost $50,000.00 to construct. The "Black Watch" was wrecked on the craggy coast of Fair Isle on 19 September 1877, four months after she was launched in Nova Scotia on her maiden voyage. The crew, the ship's provisions as well as the sails and any salvageable hardware were all saved.
Smith had closed his shipyard upon completion of the "Black Watch", reportedly over a wage dispute with his employees. He continued to order ships mainly from builders in Saint John, New Brunswick. Smith was also a director of the Avon Marine and Shipowners Insurance Company.
Steamers began to gain prominence on the seas in the 1870s and wooden shipbuilding began a serious decline. Cargo could be transported quicker and for a cheaper price by steamer than by sailing ship. The post Confederation policy of the Canadian government forced trade with Upper Canada, using the inland railway. Smith found success with wooden sailign ships longer than most but after his death, the wooden ships that had been the pride of Windsor were being sold at low prices in Italy and Scandinavia as they could afford to run them. "Windsor,the town that had been noted for the size,number and seaworthiness of vessels built there,had gone by its prime.The days of shipbuilding in Windsor has passed forever".
Bennett Smith's sons Thomas and Charles took over his business after Smith's death in Windsor at the age of 87. Today a detailed mural of the "Black Watch" is painted on the old Hants Journal building on Gerrish Street in Windsor, N.S.as a proud reminder of the community's shipbuilding heritage.

David Laserscanner

DAVID Laserscanner is a software package for low-cost 3D laser scanning. It allows scanning and digitizing of three-dimensional objects using a camera (e.g. a web cam), a hand-held line laser (i.e. one that projects a line, not just a point), and two plain boards in the background. Its most distinctive feature is that the laser line can simply be swept over the object by hand (like a virtual brush) until the results are satisfactory. At the same time, DAVID Laserscanner generates 3D data in real time and shows them on the computer screen. 
The resulting 3D mesh can be exported into well-known file formats and can thus be imported and processed in most 3D applications. The software is also able to grab the texture and "stitch together" scans made from different viewing directions.
Scanning process.
An initial calibration is made to determine the lens parameters and location of the camera relative to the background boards, which are two vertical planes positioned at 90 degrees to one another behind the object to be scanned. When scanning, the camera must be able to see part of the laser line on each board. This enables the software to reconstruct the plane of the projected laser light. Once it has determined the two-dimensional plane that the line laser is projecting, it is able to analyse the image of the laser line falling on the scanned object and resolve it into points in space.
History.
Development of DAVID Laserscanner started in September 2006 by German computer scientists Dr. Simon Winkelbach and Sven Molkenstruck, research associates of the Institute for Robotics and Process Control of the TU Braunschweig. The concept has been published as a research paper and has received the Best Paper Award at the German Association for Pattern Recognition (DAGM) on September 14, 2006, in Berlin.
DAVID Laserscanner was originally available for free but has increased in price since late 2008. The companion software, 3D Shapefusion, was originally sold for €25. DAVID Laserscanner now includes both products in the €329 price tag (as of March 2012).

L'Argent (1928 film)

"L'Argent" ("money") is a French silent film directed in 1928 by Marcel L'Herbier. The film was adapted from the novel "L'Argent" by Émile Zola, and it portrays the world of banking and the stock market in Paris in the 1920s.
Background.
Marcel L'Herbier had become one of the most prominent French film-makers during the 1920s, but even after he had sought greater creative independence by establishing his own production company, Cinégraphic, he experienced continual frustration over the financial arrangements under which he had to work. He said that after ten years of making films, he became "obsessed by a single idea: to film at any cost, even (what a paradox) at great cost, a fierce denunciation of money".
He chose as the basis of his story Zola's novel "L'Argent" about the corrupting power of money throughout society, but he insisted that it should be updated from the 1860s to present-day Paris. He envisaged a film on a large scale (having been impressed by Abel Gance's "Napoléon") and set about arranging a budget of 3 million francs (the eventual cost was nearly 5 million.). To achieve this he had to put his own company in partnership with the Société des Cinéromans of Jean Sapène, and also agreed a distribution deal with the German company UFA which resulted in the engagement of two German stars among the cast.
Synopsis.
Saccard and Gunderman are rival Paris bankers. Saccard sees an opportunity to rescue his failing bank, Banque Universelle, by financing the solo transatlantic flight of Jacques Hamelin, a pioneering aviator, and then capitalising on his popularity to set up a colonial business project in Guyane. He also hopes to seduce Hamelin's wife Line in his absence. When a rumour circulates that Hamelin has crashed, Saccard exploits the false reports to manipulate shares at the Bourse.
Gunderman disapproves of Saccard and his methods, and has secretly bought shares in his bank as a future weapon against him. The Baroness Sandorf, a former lover of Saccard, acts as a spy to assist Gunderman's interests, and more particularly her own. 
Hamelin's work in Guyane becomes an expensive liability, and his failing eyesight prevents him from keeping adequate control of the accounts. Saccard ensnares the naïve Line in mounting debts which compel her to tolerate his attentions. Incited by Sandorf, Line makes a formal complaint about Saccard's financial dealings, which launches an enquiry, and when she discovers how her husband's reputation has been compromised by Saccard she tries to shoot him at a party. Sandorf now restrains her, fearful for her own investments if Saccard were to die. Gunderman sells his shares in Saccard's bank and precipitates its collapse. Saccard is arrested, along with Hamelin who has returned to France. Saccard's duplicity is exposed in court, and through Gunderman's intervention Hamelin is released. Saccard goes to prison, but wastes no time before planning new financial schemes - with the aid of his gaoler.
Production.
L'Herbier's decision to update Zola's story to the present-day met with strong criticism even before filming began. The theatre and film director André Antoine published a newspaper article denouncing such a betrayal of Zola's depiction of society in the Second Empire and arguing that it was unacceptable to treat a classic work of literature in this way. L'Herbier delivered a robust reply, pointing out the long history of literary transpositions and arguing that to treat Zola's novel as a period piece would be to betray the passion of its theme. 
Filming began in spring 1928 and continued until the autumn. At the Joinville studios the art directors André Barsacq and Lazare Meerson constructed several monumental sets for key scenes: the grand interiors of the respective banks of Saccard and Gunderman, the Hamelins' apartment with its view over the skyline of Paris, the baroness Sandorf's mansion with its split-level gaming room, and for Saccard's party the massive room in his house with one wall consisting of organ-pipes and a central pool and fountains with a bridge providing a stage for the entertainers. Other scenes required location shooting with large numbers of extras. The departure of Hamelin's transatlantic flight was filmed at Le Bourget airport. For three days over the weekend of Pentecost L'Herbier was allowed to take over the Paris Bourse and employed 2000 extras in the stock-exchange scenes. Still more challenging was a night-time scene in the Place de l'Opéra which had to be specially lit and filled with people to convey the feverish excitement of waiting for news of Hamelin's flight. 
For his principal cameraman L'Herbier chose Jules Kruger who had devised the elaborate camerawork of Gance's "Napoléon". Within the huge spaces of the sets they employed unusually active movements for the camera whose virtuosity makes them highly visible to the spectator. At Saccard's party the camera glides back and forth above the guests; in the bank scenes it moves alongside and among the crowds. Most strikingly of all, in the scenes at the Bourse, a vertical shot from the high ceiling down to the "corbeille" (dealers' enclosure) makes the scene resemble the teeming activity of ants; and an automatic camera then creates a dizzying effect as it spirals down towards the floor. The result is a sense of dynamic exploration of the spaces contrasting with the monumental appearance of the sets. 
Another innovation that L'Herbier employed for the first screening of the film was the use of recorded sound effects. For the scenes of Hamelin's take-off at the airfield, which is intercut with scenes of frantic activity at the Bourse, authentic recordings were made in both settings and then a composite blend of them was played back from records in the cinema. It was perhaps symbolic that only seventeen days after the première of "L'Argent" this genuinely experimental use of integrated sound was superseded by the first showing in Paris of the first American sound film, "The Jazz Singer".
L'Herbier's original cut of the film, which was shown to the press in December 1928, ran for about 200 minutes. During the latter stages of production, his relationship with Jean Sapène, his co-producer, had virtually broken down, and to his dismay he found that at the first public showing in January 1929, the film had been re-edited in places on Sapène's instructions and was now more than 30 minutes shorter. Although L'Herbier took the dispute to arbitration and was subsequently able to restore some of the missing material, on its initial release the film was seen only in the truncated version. A reconstructed shot-for-shot screenplay of the original version was published in 1978.
Reception.
On its release the film seems to have had some commercial success, particularly in Germany. Its reception among critics was more mixed, as some regarded it as a visual triumph while others found scant justification in the story for the indulgence in spectacular sets and energetic camerawork. In the 1970s, however, a detailed study by Noël Burch, in which he argued that "L'Argent" was a ground-breaking work and one of the cinema's greatest achievements, launched a re-evaluation of the film. As a result, Marcel L'Herbier's own assessment that this was the summit of his silent career, has found wider endorsement.
"Autour de L'Argent".
L'Herbier arranged with Jean Dréville, then a 22-year old journalist and amateur photographer, that he should make a simultaneous documentary about the filming of "L'Argent". The resulting film, entitled "Autour de L'Argent" (1928), was itself a vigorous exercise in poetic montage, capturing the atmosphere and sheer scale of the sets from the points of view of the lighting riggers, the cameramen and the extras. It shows L'Herbier meticulously directing his actors and marshalling the crowds of extras. It also reveals how the intricate camera movements were achieved with ground-level trolleys, floating platforms and a free-swinging camera suspended from the roof. The film, which runs for about 40 minutes, was originally silent, but in 1971 a soundtrack was added with commentary spoken by Dréville himself.

Landsbankinn

Landsbankinn (literally "the national bank", originally NBI hf, also known as Nýi Landsbanki, Icelandic for "new national bank") is an Icelandic bank headquartered in Reykjavík. It was established in 2008 by the Icelandic government out of the domestic operations of its predecessor Landsbanki which failed during the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis. It is one of the largest banks in Iceland and the history of its predecessor goes back to 1886.
The bank has been state owned since its establishment and its current shareholders are the Icelandic State Financial Investments with 81.33% of the shares in the bank, while the remaining 18.67% of the shares are currently owned by the winding-up receivership (Landsskil) for the old bankrupt Landsbanki.
History.
NBI hf was created 9 October 2008, after the government had taken control of the insolvent Landsbanki two days earlier and decided to split all domestic operations into this new surviving version of the bank, while leaving the remaining foreign operations of Landsbanki for bankruptcy and winding-up proceedings. The total assets value declined roughly to a third for the new bank, when comparing to the previous size for the old version of the bank. The number of employees were also reduced from 2770 in 2007, to only 1233 in 2012.
In April 2011, the legal name was changed from NBI hf. to Landsbankinn hf.

Lake Apo

Lake Apo is a crater lake in Barangay Guinoyoran in the City of Valencia in Bukidnon province in the southern Philippines. It is located in a hilly area about in elevation, about WSW of the city "poblacion" (town center). Lake Apo was awarded the cleanest inland body of water in Northern Mindanao Region (Region X) in the late 1990s. The green body of water has an estimated area of with maximum depths reaching up to .
Etymology.
The name of the lake come from the Filipino term ""apo"," meaning elder or grandparent. According to legend, there was a man living in the mountains who assaulted his granddaughter and was punished by the mountain deities for his disrespectful act by flooding the area forming the Lake Apo.
Geology.
The lake is a crater lake, a basin formed on an old volcanic cone that was later filled with water. It was erroneously reported as a circular rift lake, as this area is not a rift zone but a volcanic area evident by the presence of nearby volcanic peaks like Musuan Peak [ to the E], Mount Kalatungan [ to the NW], Mount Dagumbaan [ to the SW], Mount Kidongin [ to the SW] and the volcanic field east of Pangantucan, Bukidnon [ to the west]. Another small volcanic cone is located just southwest of Lake Apo.

History of CD Málaga

Origins.
The club can trace its history back to 1904 with the formation of "Málaga Foot-Ball Club". It was nothing more than a society intended to promote football, a new sport in the city, carried from the United Kingdom. Its first rivals were small teams formed by crew of foreign ships arriving to local harbor. In 1907, further attempts of popularizing football were performed by Málaga FC.
1912 saw the arrival of a rival club "FC Malagueño", and the establishment of a great rivalry with Málaga FC, which had merged with other minor clubs like Málaga Racing. In 1927, Málaga FC became "Real Málaga FC" after they were granted royal patronage by Alfonso XIII. 
During the 1929-30 season both of Real Málaga FC and FC Malagueño clubs became founder members of the "Tercera División". In late 1930, Real Málaga FC, were reformed as "Málaga Sports Club".
Club merging in 1933.
In 1933 "Málaga SC" and "FC Malagueño" merged to become "Club Deportivo Malacitano", although it wasn't a real merging at all, but a naming change of FC Malagueño, which had a good economic wealth and also a better squad than Málaga SC. By this operation, "CD Malacitano" was able to heir the squad of FC Malagueño, having their contracts being cancelled in the other way.
In 1934 this new club made its debut in the "Segunda División" when the division was expanded from ten teams to twenty four. After various seasons in "Segunda División", with the competition interrupted because of the Spanish Civil War, in 1941 the club changed their name to "Club Deportivo Málaga", as new stadium, La Rosaleda, was also inaugurated.
First promotion to La Liga in 1949, first topflight years.
In 1949, Málaga promoted for the first time to "La Liga" after several seasons in "Segunda División" and a couple in the third level.
With chairman Miguel Navarro Nogueroles and coach Luís Urquiri, the club managed to promote in the last play of the 1948-49 season, in second position after leader Real Sociedad, and thanks to positive goal difference with Granada CF. Notable striker Pedro Bazán, who had previously scored 9 goals in a sole match against Hércules CF, was the top goal scorer and also one of the most important players of the team.
In this first run in "La Liga", Málaga stayed there two consecutive seasons, with notable former player Ricardo Zamora as coach of the team, and until the first relegation of the club at the end of 1950-51 season, lacking just one point to maintain status.
In the subsequent seasons, Málaga achieved two new promotions to La Liga in 1951-52 and 1953–54, being relegated after just one year in both. The 1952-53 season was notable because of a resounding 6-0 thrashing of Real Madrid at La Rosaleda, the major result up to date of Málaga against this club.
The golden years in the early 1970s.
After several new fleeting first level promotions in the 1960s, which turned out in immediate relegations, Málaga promoted once again in 1969-70 under the command of chairman Antonio Rodríguez López and coach Jenő Kálmár, to start a five-year top flight stay.However, president in charge Antonio Rodríguez López was brutally murdered because of Mafia issues in the year 1971, and was replaced by Rafael Serrano Carvajal for the rest of that run.
With notable players like Miguel Ramos Vargas "Migueli", Sebastian Viberti, Juan Antonio Deusto and José Díaz Macías, the club achieved two seven league places in 1971-72 and 1973-74 (best results of the club up to date), a Ricardo Zamora Trophy in 1971-72 season performed by goalkeeper Deusto, and a 1972-1973 run of the club in the Spanish Cup, where they were dumped out in the semifinals by Athletic Bilbao. They also notably scored a victory on Camp Nou for the first time after winning to FC Barcelona at the end of the 1971-72 season. The club also established in 1973 an official anthem, "Málaga La Bombonera", and from that moment the song is still the official anthem of the club.
After a polemic exit of Viberti of the club at the end of 1973-74 season, the so-called "golden years" ended with a new relegation to the second level in 1974-75.
Club replacement in 1992.
Málaga had a reserve club, founded on May 25, 1948 when CD Málaga took over a junior club, "CD Santo Tomás", with the purpose of establishing a reserve team. The club was renamed "Club Atlético Malagueño", reviving the name of one of the two clubs that had merged to form CD Málaga in 1933.
During the 1959-60 season "CA Malagueño" and CD Málaga found themselves together in the third level. As a reserve team, the former should have been relegated. To avoid this, they separated from their parent club and registered as an independent club with the Royal Spanish Football Federation.
In 1992 when CD Málaga dissolved after financial difficulties, "CA Malagueño" continued playing. The 1992-93 season saw them playing in "Tercera Division Group 9". After a successful campaign, the club was promoted to "Segunda División B". However, the following season the club was relegated again and, facing financial difficulties, also seriously faced closure. On December 19, 1993, in a referendum, the club’s members voted in favour of changing names and, on June 29, 1994 "CA Malagueño" changed their name to "Málaga Club de Fútbol S.A.D.", becoming from then an official succession to what was previously called "Club Deportivo Málaga".

After a successful campaign, the club was promoted to "Segunda División B". However, the following season the club was relegated again and, facing financial difficulties, also seriously faced closure. On December 19, 1993, in a referendum, the club's members voted in favour of changing names and, on June 29, 1994 "CA Malagueño" changed their name to "Málaga Club de Fútbol S.A.D.", becoming from then an official succession to what was previously called "Club Deportivo Málaga".
A new rise in prominence in the early 2000s.
In the early 2000s Málaga were a club rich in youth and top quality players, also boasting a more modern and developed stadium. Although they never pushed for a Champions League place, Málaga were always successful under the vastly popular Joaquín Peiró. 
They shared the sole appearance and only official trophy, the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2002, beating Gent, Willem II and an improving Villarreal CF. Málaga's run in the UEFA Cup was an overachievement, which ended in the quarterfinals to Boavista FC's hands, after beating FK Željezničar Sarajevo, (who'd been eliminated from the Champions League by Newcastle United), Amica Wronki, Leeds United (after a 2-1 win at Elland Road, courtesy of 2 Julio Dely Valdés) and AEK Athens F.C., losing to Boavista on penalties. 
After Peiró's retirement, a mass exodus slowly started to occur. Dario Silva, Kiki Musampa, Julio Dely Valdés and Pedro Contreras all left the club. Juande Ramos took over the helm and notably performed a resounding 5-1 home thrashing of FC Barcelona, the major result up to date of Málaga against this club, with a hat trick from loanee, Salva (who would end up missing out on the "pichichi" trophy by just 2 goals). Ramos was then appointed Sevilla FC manager and Gregorio Manzano took charge.
The slow decline and economical issues.
Although steering Málaga to their second consecutive 10th placed finish, Manzano couldn't prevent a lackluster side beating the drop, after finishing bottom of the league with 24 points to their name.
As the new second division season started, Málaga were in high hopes and started off well. However their form dramatically dropped and for 2 of the remaining 6 weeks, were in the relegation zone. Málaga luckily overturned this and survived their first Segunda season.
The new season wasn't one with much confidence, players were brought in and fans looked worried. By winning 8 of their first 11 games, Málaga seemed to be on track for promotion early into the season; however, after a drop of form and poor tactics, they sacrificed their lead to CD Numancia and faced a battle for promotion with one game remaining, against Sporting de Gijón and Real Sociedad. Needing a win or for either rival team to slip up in order to be promoted, Málaga won 2-1, after 2 goals by Antonio Hidalgo to finish second and return to the top flight, at Real Sociedad's expense.
The arrival of Sheikh Al Thani.
Looking for a brighter economic future, the club negotiated with Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani to purchase Malaga. Al Thani purchased the club on June 11, 2010 and became president on July 28. Jesualdo Ferreira was signed on as the manager, but was eventually sacked because of a series of bad results. Chilean Manuel Pellegrini who formerly managed both Villarreal and Real Madrid became the new coach while the club was situated in relegation zone. Malaga was able to obtain five consecutive wins later in the season, a historic first for the club. With several new signings which include Maresca, Martin Demichelis, and Julio Baptista, the club was able to get out of the relegation zone and finish in 11th place.

Mysore (1789–91)

The battle honour of Mysore commemorates the Third Anglo-Mysore War of 1789-92. Tipu Sultan attacked Travancore on 29 December 1789 and this made the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas apprehensive who entered into a "Triple Alliance" with the English. The Third Anglo-Mysore War went on for about two years in three campaigns. Cornwallis, the Governor General took command after the first campaign, captured Bangalore on 21 March 1791 but failed to capture Seringapatnam due to brilliant generalship of Tipu and the rains. Fighting was resumed later and Tipu captured Coimbatore on 3 November. Helped by an Army sent from Bombay, Cornwallis occupied the hill fort of Nandy Droog about 50 kilometres north of Bangalore on his line of communication towards Seringapatnam where he reached on 5 February 1792. 
Tipu averted a complete disaster and concluded a treaty in March surrendering half his dominions; a large portion went to the Nizam, a portion went to the Marathas, the English acquired Malabar and Coorg on the west coast, Dindigul and adjoining districts. on the south and the Baramahal district on the east.
The honour was awarded to 29 units of the armies of the Bombay and Madras Presidency vide GOGG 378 of 1889 of which only 15 survive. It was awarded to four units of the Bengal Native Infantry which mutinied in 1857 vide GOGG 43 of 1829.

National Women's Register

National Women’s Register (NWR) is an organisation of women’s groups in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and the Netherlands. There is a branch of the organisation in Zimbabwe known as Women In Touch (WIT). There are individual members in France, Luxembourg, New Zealand, The Republic of Ireland, Uganda and The United Arab Emirates.
History.
NWR was founded in 1960. Mary Stott was editor of "The Guardian" Women’s Page and Betty Jerman wrote an article entitled "Squeezed in like sardines in Suburbia", saying that Suburbia was "“an incredibly dull place to live and I blame the women. Their work kept them alert. Home and child-minding can have a blunting effect on a woman’s mind, but only she can sharpen it."" 
Maureen Nicol, one such housewife, wrote a letter to the editor in response saying: "“Since having my first baby I have been constantly surprised how women seem to go into voluntary exile in the home once they leave their outside work… Perhaps housebound wives with liberal interests and a desire to remain individuals could form a national register so that whenever one moves, one could contact like-minded friends.”" 
Maureen was inundated with replies to her letter and the Housebound Housewives Register, as it was first called, began. The name was soon changed to "National Housewives' Register, and in 1987 to National Women's Register".
In 1995 Maureen Nicol was awarded the OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to women by founding the organisation.
Group Activities.
Members belong to a local group. Local groups usually meet twice a month in each other's homes to discuss pre-arranged topics as well as arranging outings, visits to places of interest and meetings with other groups.
Groups also arrange larger meetings, day conferences and discussion lunches.
The Annual Conference, with themes, workshops and professional speakers is held over three days, usually on a University campus and provides an opportunity for all members to meet.
Support Functions.
Some members volunteer to provide services to the organisation by running Book Groups, Correspondence Magazines, a Research Bank and Pen Friend groups.
Archives.
The archives of the National Women's Register are held at The Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics, ref 5NWR

Peter Garthwaite

Peter Fawcitt Garthwaite who was born 22 October 1909, Guisborough, North Yorkshire, England and died 13 May 2001, Hovingham, North Yorkshire, England, was a forester who worked in a wide range of settings - imperial and national, public and private. In his professional life he championed the causes of landscape and wild life conservation alongside the demands of timber production. After starting his career in Burma, Garthwaite served in senior posts with the British Forestry Commission from 1947 to 1970, and was then made president of the Royal Society of Forestry of England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1972 to 1974.
He was a silviculturalist who had an extensive knowledge of trees and forestry practice, but he also recognised the advantages of different silvicultural practices in different circumstances.
Early life.
Garthwaite was born at Guisborough, in North Yorkshire, on 22 October 1909. His father, who came from Durham, was a land agent who worked for the Earl of Airlie for some years .
Peter and his identical twin Clive, who later became a brigadier in the Royal Artillery, were educated at Wellington College, where they caused some confusion when bowling from either end for the First XI. Peter went on to Oxford University where he studied in the department of forestry, and won Blues for both cricket and hockey.He married Betty Gorman in 1945 and they had two sons, of whom the elder, Simon, was killed in action with the SAS in Oman in 1974, and a daughter.
Career.
Garthwaite's professional life began in Burma in 1931. He already showed a wide range of environmental interests. For Garthwaite, forestry was always part of the spectrum of nature and during his time in Burma he co-edited Smythies's Birds of Burma, which is still a standard work of ornithology, as well as authoring other works.
He worked in Burma until 1947 although his career was interrupted by war service in the Indian Army Royal Engineers, in which he attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel.
When he returned Britain, Garthwaite joined the Forestry Commission at a time when its projects were expanding rapidly. He became a district officer first at Dalby Forest in North Yorkshire and then at Kielder Forest in Northumberland.
In the 1960s he reacted strongly against the then-current view of forestry, driven by economics and based on the rigid application of "net discounted revenue" assessments of timber value; he regarded this as short-sighted, and in association with the landscape architect Dame Sylvia Crowe he fought to broaden the Commission's approach to take account of conservation and landscape.
He was saluted for his work on the committee which drafted the 1963 Deer Act, and in 1964 he was appointed the Commission's first conservation officer. He went on to become the Commission's head of forestry management, with responsibilities throughout the country.
After leaving the Commission in 1970, Garthwaite developed a practice as a forestry consultant, and continued to spread his knowledge through specialist journals and personal contact.He was a forestry adviser to the Crown Estate and a patron of the Woodland Trust and Woodland Heritage. Garthwaite became particularly associated with "continuous cover" forestry, which fitted well with his conservationist approach and of which he had seen examples in Europe as well as in Burma. He was appointed to the OBE in 1972.
In 1995 he wrote:
My forestry philosophy has not altered in the 65 years that I have been in practice: it is that wood is a renewable resource, and woodlands and forests should be managed to produce the highest quality timber of which the site is capable; and that as a general rule when trees have reached their prime maturity, they should be felled to live on for many years in such form that their quality dictates; as oak beams supporting the roof of a cathedral; as fine craftsman-made furniture; as a framework for a house.
When he retired he returned to North Yorkshire, where his large woodland garden was filled with many notable trees.

The Winner's Song

"The Winner's Song" is a single by fictional character Geraldine McQueen from "Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice", a spoof talent contest/comedy by British comedian Peter Kay, who also plays Geraldine. It was released in Europe on 13 October 2008.
The song was co-written by Kay together with Gary Barlow from Take That, and parodies the style of changing key part-way through a song - a popular trick of modern day pop songs - starting out in A flat major, moving up to B flat major, and then quickly up to B major.
Video.
The video to the song was released both as a DVD single and as part of the Peter Kay compilation "Special Kay", 
Parody.
The video itself is a parody of Leona Lewis' video for her debut single, "A Moment Like This", and the box art of the single is a parody of "The Meaning of Love", the debut album from Michelle McManus, who won the second series of "Pop Idol" in 2003.

Sandyfield, New York

Sandyfield was a settlement of about 30 houses in the Town of Ramapo in Rockland County, New York, USA, that was submerged when swampy Beaver Pond was dammed to create Lake Welch in Harriman State Park by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in 1928.
The hamlet was settled in about 1760 along the road from Stony Point to Central Valley; the road is now a hiking trail called the Hasenclever Road. In 1910, when the state park was created, the residents were notified that they would have to leave their homes; there was an attempt to resist through political channels, but in 1939 the last residents were ordered to leave. By 1942, the lake was completed using workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps that was building the park. The new lake was named in honor of William A. Welch the first chairman of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission that built Harriman.

Scream 4

Scream 4 (stylized as SCRE4M) is a 2011 American slasher film and the fourth installment in the "Scream" series. Directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, writer of "Scream" and "Scream 2", the film stars an ensemble cast which includes Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere. The plot involves Sidney Prescott returning to Woodsboro after ten years as part of her book tour. As soon as she arrives, Ghostface once again begins killing students from Woodsboro High, including her younger cousin's friends. Prescott, Gale Weathers-Riley, and Dewey Riley once again team up to stop the murders, but not before having to learn from a new generation the "new rules" of surviving horror films.
Originally, the series was intended to be a trilogy, but film production was approved by Bob Weinstein. Depending on the box office, "Scream 4" is intended to be the first of a new trilogy. Williamson had to leave production early due to contractual obligations and Ehren Kruger ("Scream 3") was brought in for re-writes. Campbell, Arquette and Cox are the only returning cast members from the previous films and were the first to sign on to the film in September 2009. Panettiere and Rory Culkin were the first of the new cast to sign on in May 2010. Ashley Greene was initially the choice of the lead character, Jill, but the role eventually went to Roberts. Filming took place in and around Ann Arbor, Michigan in June 2010 to September 2010, with re-shoots in early 2011.
"Scream 4" was released on April 15, 2011, and took in $19.3 million its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, making it the second-lowest opening since the first film. The film has grossed more than $101.3 million at the worldwide box office due to a strong international gross. It gained mostly positive reviews, as critics agreed that it was an improvement over its predecessor, and praised Craven's direction and Williamson's writing.
Plot.
On the night of the fifteenth anniversary of the Woodsboro Massacre, high school students Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper are attacked and brutally murdered in their home by a new Ghostface.
The following day, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro to promote her new book with her publicist Rebecca Walters. After evidence is found in Sidney's rental car, Sidney becomes a suspect in the murders and must stay in town until the murders are solved. Her cousin, Jill, who is dealing with the betrayal of her ex-boyfriend, Trevor Sheldon, gets a threatening phone call from Ghostface, as does her friend Olivia Morris. Jill and Olivia, alongside their friend Kirby Reed, are questioned about their calls by Dewey Riley, who is now the sheriff of the town, with assistance from Judy Hicks. Meanwhile Gale Weathers-Riley, now married to Dewey, is struggling with writer's block. She decides that the new Ghostface murders could revamp her career and begins delving into the case despite Dewey's protests.
Sidney stays with Jill and her aunt Kate Roberts while in Woodsboro. Later that night, Olivia, who lives next door, is attacked and killed by Ghostface as Jill and Kirby watch in horror through Jill's bedroom window. Sidney and Jill rush to the house, but the killer attacks and injures them and gets away; both are taken to the hospital. Later that night in the hospital's parking garage, Ghostface murders Rebecca. Gale then enlists the help of two high school movie geeks, Charlie Walker and Robbie Mercer, who explain that the killer is following the rules of movie remakes to plan the murders. Charlie concludes that the killer will likely strike at a party being held that night. Gale goes to the party to investigate and is attacked by Ghostface before Dewey arrives; he takes her to the hospital. Meanwhile, two police officers assigned to patrol Jill's house discover a window to be empty. Both are then subsequently murdered and taken from the house's property. Kate, meanwhile, arrives home as Sidney receives a phone call threatening to murder Jill, causing the two to attempt to save her as Jill does not answer her phone. Ghostface is revealed to be outside of the house and stabs Kate in the back through the front door's mail slot, killing her. Sidney then runs into a suspicious Judy whilst escaping from the house and heads to Kirby's house to save Jill.
Ghostface appears at the party and kills a drunken Robbie soon before Sidney arrives at the house. During a confrontation with Ghostface, Sidney instructs Jill to hide under a bed upstairs, while she narrowly escapes Ghostface. Kirby is forced to answer horror movie trivia to save Charlie, who is tied up outside. After she answers Ghostface's questions, she goes outside to untie Charlie, believing that she has won the game. He suddenly stabs her in the stomach and reveals himself as the Ghostface killer, leaving her for dead. Sidney is confronted by Charlie and a second Ghostface, who is revealed as Jill. It was Charlie and Jill, who were behind the killings. Jill tells Sidney about her jealousy of Sidney's fame after the murder of Sidney's mother and how Sidney has survived the attempts on her life. She then pulls Trevor, her ex-boyfriend, out of a closet and shoots him in the groin for his previous betrayal of their relationship, then in the head, killing him. Jill then betrays and kills Charlie by stabbing him, intending to pin him as Trevor's accomplice. Jill then stabs Sidney in the stomach leaving her for dead. She then trashes the house and mutilates herself in order to stage the scene. Dewey, Judy, and the rest of the police then stumble upon the carnage.
Jill is then taken to the hospital to be treated. Dewey visits Jill, who believes she is the sole survivor and talks about writing about it with Gale as they have matching wounds. Dewey tells her Sidney is actually still alive and likely to survive though she is in intensive care. Jill is shocked that Sidney has survived but Dewey mistakes this for concern and reassures her that everything will be all right even if Sidney can't remember what happened. Dewey then visits Gale and talks about Jill's plans for a collaboration and Gale realises there is no reason that she should know she was also injured in the shoulder. Meanwhile Jill has made her way to Sidney's room to finish her off but is unable to complete the task before Dewey, Gale and Judy intervene; Jill is distracted by them which gives Sidney the chance to shock her with a defibrillator and then shoot her, killing her. Dewey calls in all police units, as media reporters outside confirm Jill as a survivor and a "hero, right out of the movies".
Production.
Development.
"Scream 4" was announced by The Weinstein Company in July 2008, with Wes Craven saying that he would not mind directing the film if the script was as good as "Scream". In March 2010 it was confirmed that he would indeed direct and stated that, "I am delighted to accept Bob Weinstein's offer to take the reins on a whole new chapter in "Scream" history. Working with Courteney, David and Neve was a blast ten years ago and I'm sure it will be again. And I can't wait to find the talent that will bring new blood to the screen as well. Kevin is right on his game with the new script – the characters and story crackle with energy and originality – to say nothing of some of the most hair-raising scares I've seen in a script since... well, since the original "Scream" series. Let me at it".
In May 2010, Cathy Konrad, who produced the first three films in the series, filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company, alleging that they violated a written agreement that entitled her company, Cat Entertainment, first rights to produce all films in the series. The Weinsteins argued that this contract required Konrad's services be exclusive to the franchise, which Konrad calls "false pretext". claiming the previous film did not require this condition. The suit accuses the Weinsteins of surreptitious behavior and "a scheme to force Plaintiffs to walk away from the "Scream" franchise without compensation," enabling them to cut costs by hiring someone else to produce (Craven's wife, Iya Labunka, not named in the suit). In April 2011, it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Konrad, the details remaining confidential, though it was claimed that she would receive a cash payment plus a percentage of the profits from "Scream 4".
Writing.
Craven stated that within the ten years that have passed between "Scream 3" and "Scream 4", there have been no "real life" Ghostface murders but have been numerous sequels to the film-within-a-film "Stab". He also commented on the life status of Sidney Prescott, "She's done her best to move on from the events that occurred in the previous films, even releasing a successful book". Craven said that endless sequels, the modern spew of remakes, film studios, and directors are the butts of parodies in the film. The main characters have to figure out where the horror genre is in current days to figure out the modern events happening to and around them.
In an early draft of the script, Gale and Dewey had a baby, but was changed after it was decided bringing a baby into the film would make shooting "impossible". In another early form of the script, the opening scene involved Sidney going head-to-head with Ghostface and being left for dead. There would have been a two-year gap in the story while she recovered, however, Bob Weinstein feared it would slow the pace of the story and bringing in young characters would work out best.
"Scream 3" writer Ehren Kruger was brought in during production to do re-writes. Craven said, "Look, there was a bumpy period when things shifted over from Kevin to Ehren. I signed up to do a script by Kevin and unfortunately that didn't go all the way through the shooting. But it certainly is Kevin's script and concept and characters and themes". It was reported that the actors were not given the 140-page script past page 75 in order to protect the identity of the Ghostface killer.
Casting.
In September 2009, "Variety" reported that Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courteney Cox would return. Craven briefly explained their roles in a later interview with "Entertainment Weekly", saying "It's a total integration of those three and new kids. The story of Sid, Gale, and Dewey is very much a part of the movie." At a press conference for "Repo Men", Liev Schreiber — who played Cotton Weary in the first three films — stated there were no plans for his reprisal. In an interview with FEARnet, Williamson continued to deny a rumor of Jamie Kennedy returning, "I would love nothing more than to have Jamie Kennedy in the film. However to have Randy in the film, it sort of just takes it... I mean "Scream 2" was a lie, you know? It's a false move. So I just won't do it. I can't do that. I just won't do it." In April, over 12 casting sides were released to the public to buy for auditions of the film.
In May 2010, Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin signed on. Ashley Greene was offered the role of Sidney's cousin, Jill, but the role later went to Emma Roberts. Lake Bell was to play Deputy Judy Hicks, but dropped out four days before filming due to scheduling conflicts, causing the role to ultimately go to Marley Shelton. Nancy O'Dell reprises her role from the second and third films as a reporter. Roger L. Jackson returned as the voice of Ghostface. Lauren Graham was to play Kate Roberts, the mother of Roberts' character, but dropped out a few days into principal photography. Craven, like in the previous three films, has a cameo and took to his Twitter to ask fans to pick his role (the cameo was, however, deleted from the final cut of the film). "The Hollywood Reporter" reported that Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell have cameos in the beginning of the film akin to Drew Barrymore and Jada Pinkett Smith in the first and second "Scream". Shenae Grimes and Lucy Hale also have cameos in the film. Hale was originally supposed to play a different role in the film, but due to scheduling conflicts with her show "Pretty Little Liars", the producers gave her a smaller part.
Filming.
On a budget of $40 million, principal photography began on June 28, 2010. Filming was scheduled to end on September 6, after a 42-day shoot, but instead concluded on September 24. Filming took place in and around Ann Arbor, Michigan. Scenes portraying Woodsboro High School school featured in the original "Scream" film were shot at Woodworth Middle School in Dearborn, Michigan. The former 16th District Court in Livonia, Michigan was used as a police station.
In April 2010, while scouting for a bookstore to use in the film, Craven spotted a new bookstore that had not yet opened in downtown Northville, Michigan named Next Chapter Bookstore Bistro. Craven instantly loved the building as well as the name and decided to use both in the film. He also hired the owner's chef to prepare the food and pastry for a scene in the film. The scenes were shot the first week of July. After the test screening in January, Craven and Weinstein did not think two scenes played well for the audience. Aimee Teegarden and Alison Brie returned to Detroit in late January and early February of 2011 for four days of additional shooting. The scenes involved Teegarden's character who is stalked at her home and Brie's character who is attacked in a parking garage.
The film also extensively used computer-generated imagery for the first time in the franchise. For example, instead of using a "collapsing knife", the knife's blade was added during post-production with CGI effects. Anderson's death scene in which he is stabbed in the forehead and walks a few feet while talking before finally falling to his death, was not in the script but was inspired by a "real-life medical emergency" Craven had seen in a documentary about a person being stabbed through their head and walking into an emergency room. He thought it was "extraordinary if somebody was stabbed in the head and still be alive for a while". Craven also did not tell the studio that he was taking this approach for the death scene, jokingly saying he hoped he would not be fired the next day.

CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a B- on an A plus to F scale.
Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, criticizing the film for using the clichéd formula of the slasher genre, but complimenting Craven's direction and Williamson's dialogue. "Empire" gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing the film's old-fashioned formula and lack of scare factor. "The New York Daily News" thought the film was "dated" and that "relying on obvious clichés doesn't seem ironic anymore, just easy." The "Toronto Sun" gave the film a mixed review, writing that "this installment is nowhere near the hip, serrated-edge blast of newness the original was in 1996. Suddenly, it's the horror thriller that, like, your parents are excited about"; however, the review praised director Wes Craven. Colin Covert of the "Minneapolis Star Tribune" gave the film a perfect score of four out of four stars, praising the combination of scares, comedy, and twists.
The "Boston Herald" wrote that the film is "often amusing" but too long. Lisa Kennedy from the "Denver Post" stated that "Scream 4" "pays plenty of homage to their 1996 original", but that it is not close to its greatness, despite calling it a "cut above most slasher flicks". Lisa Schwarzbaum of "Entertainment Weekly" praised the film, stating "It's a giddy reminder of everything that made "Scream" such a fresh scream in the first place," while Betsy Sharkey of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that ""Scream 4" finds a way to live up to its gory past while it carves out new terrors in new ways." Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" gave the movie two out of four stars, criticizing the comedic overtones.
In June 2011, "Scream 4" was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for Best Horror Movie but lost to "Paranormal Activity 2".
On March 2, 2012, "Scream 4" won the award for Best Horror Movie, and Ghostface came in third place for Best Villain at the Virgin Media Movie Awards.

The All Wales Convention was set up by Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister and Ieuan Wyn Jones, the Deputy First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, to educate the public about the current system of government in Wales and to promote a debate throughout Wales on the National Assembly for Wales’ current devolution settlement and whether there should be a referendum on moving to primary law-making powers. 
The convention was chaired by Sir Emyr Jones Parry.
The All Wales Convention reported its findings to the First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, on November 18, 2009.
The convention recommended that a referendum be held on giving the Welsh Assembly full law-making powers. Polling by the convention found that 47% would vote "yes" and 37% "no", leading the convention to claim that a yes result would be obtainable. The convention also recommended that a poll be held before June 2010, and said a full law-making Assembly would be better than the current system. 
The All Wales Convention also found that the current 60 members could handle the additional work that would come from further powers and there should be no increase in members as a result of more powers.

The Graach Gate (German: "Graacher Tor") is the last remaining town gate of the German town of Bernkastel-Kues. The name "Graach" refers to the neighbouring village of Graach connected by a narrow road to the gate. Currently the building is used as a museum of local history.
History of the city gate.
The Graach gate was built in 1300 as part of a town wall protecting the town of Bernkastel against foreign aggression. In 1689 it was partly destroyed by French troops under Louis XIV of France.
At the beginning of the 18th century the gate was reconstructed and from 1714 was used as a prison. Later on it became a hostel for the homeless.
Since 2002 the gate has been a museum of local history.
Architecture.
The gate has an integrated passage built in a Baroque style with a mansard roof created in the 18th century. Before destruction in 1689 the Graach gate, shown in a drawing dated 1590, was equipped with a tower reaching three times the size of the current building.
After reconstruction in the 18th century the gate shows typical elements of a Renaissance-style building.
A figure of the Archangel St. Michael is placed centrally over the passage protecting the inhabitants of Bernkastel from aggression by intruders. The figure is a copy while the original is exhibited in the museum of the Catholic Diocese of Trier.

Cornelius McNamara

Cornelius McNamara, better known as Connie (Mackey) Mc Namara, (6 April 1896 – 15 December 1957) was the Captain of "A" Company Active Service Unit of the Second Battalion Mid-Limerick Brigade in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence.
Early life.
Cornelius McNamara was born in Limerick city, the son of a butcher. He was educated for a period in the Christian Brothers School in Sexton Street, Limerick. He left the school around 1910 and took up an apprenticeship in one of the four large bacon factories in Limerick. When Padraig Pearse and Roger Casement came to Limerick in early 1914 to raise Volunteer companies, the seeds were planted in Cornelius' mind to join the movement later on.
Volunteers.
In October 1915, he enlisted in "C" Company Limerick City Battalion under Michael Colivet, and was present at Killonan with the rest of his battalion during the Easter Rising, but after hearing word that the Rising was called off, the battalion marched back to Limerick. Soon after, the Battalion split and he then joined "A" Company of the newly formed Second Battalion. His home then became the battalion dispatch centre and he was admitted to the ranks of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In November 1918 he was promoted to first Lieutenant.
War of Independence.
When the Irish War of Independence started on April 6, 1919, Cornelius became part of 'A' Company's Active Service Unit. On the same day, he was part of the attempted rescue of Robert Byrne, Adjutant of the Second Battalion from the City Home in Limerick. Byrne was mortally wounded and became the first Republican fatality of the Irish War of Independence. He was promoted to Captain in November 1919 and became leader of the 'A' Company Active Service Unit. On July 17, 1920, he was arrested with 4 or 5 members of his ASU collecting funds in Garryowen. He was imprisoned until mid-February 1921 and was re-arrested soon after his release and remained in prison until December 9, 1921 where he was released under a general amnesty of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 6, 1921.
Civil War.
McNamara fought on the Republican side in the Irish Civil War (1922–1923). He was made commandant of the Strand Barracks in Limerick in March 1922. 
From 15 to 20 July, the Barracks was attacked by Free State troops under Michael Brennan. After a five-day siege, he surrendered and was imprisoned in Limerick Prison and then transported by the ship Arvonia to be interned in Gormanston. While he was in Limerick prison and aboard the Arvonia he was elected prisoners' commandant.
Subsequent IRA career.
After the defeat of the anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the Civil War, McNamara was released in 23 December 1923. He became secretary of the Limerick branch for the Irish Republican Prisoners' Dependents Fund (IRPDF) from 1924 to 1925, which assisted Republican Prisoners families. He was forced to emigrate to New York in both 1925 and 1930 by Free State sympathisers, and took no further part in any more IRA activities.
Death.
He died at home in 1957 and was survived by his second wife May (née Moakley) and only daughter Patricia Corbett. His grandson Jim Corbett chronicled his life with the biography Not While I Have Ammo.

Cuba–Vanuatu relations

Relations between Vanuatu and Cuba began shortly after the former gained its independence from France and the United Kingdom in 1980, and began establishing its own foreign policy as a newly independent state. Vanuatu and Cuba established official diplomatic relations in 1983.
History.
Early Cuban-Vanuatu relations must be considered within the scope of Vanuatu's resolutely independent foreign policy. Rejecting alignment with the Western bloc during the late stages of the Cold War, Vanuatu joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1983, and established diplomatic relations both with the Soviet Union and (a few months later) with the United States in 1986.
In 1984, a Cuban diplomatic delegation visited Vanuatu, and E. Huffer suggests that this visit was instrumental in prompting the Asian Development Bank and ESCAP to open offices in Port-Vila shortly thereafter, "partly in an attempt to favour the integration of Vanuatu into the Western capitalist camp".
Vanuatu was the birthplace of Melanesian socialism, a doctrine promoted by Prime Minister Father Walter Lini, combining socialism, Christianity and traditional Melanesian values, which gave Vanuatu and Cuba some degree of common ideological ground - although Melanesian socialism may be seen as closer to Christian communism than to Marxism. In 1983, however, ni-Vanuatu Foreign Minister Sela Molisa stated that Vanuatu's joining the Non-Aligned Movement was born of a wish for neutrality, and that "the ni-Vanuatu government and the Vanua'aku Pati do not adhere to any ideology".
Lini lost office in 1991, and, under his successor Maxime Carlot Korman, his country's policy of engaging with countries viewed with suspicion by the West -notably Cuba, Libya and the Soviet Union- was allowed to fade.
More recently, in the 2000s, quasi-dormant relations between the two countries have been revived, in the context of Cuba's regional engagement in the Pacific. Cuba currently provides medical aid to Vanuatu and other countries in Oceania. As of September 2008, seventeen ni-Vanuatu are studying medicine in Cuba, with their expenses paid for by the Cuban government, and Cuban doctors are serving in Vanuatu.

Gloria (Shadows of Knight album)

Gloria is the first album by The Shadows of Knight, released in 1966. The Shadows of Knight are primarily known for their hit version of the Van Morrison penned Them band's "Gloria". At the same time, the band today is regarded as one of the original punk bands.
The band's association with "Gloria" has caused some to miscategorize them as one-hit wonders. One reviewer points out that their first album, and its follow-up, "Back Door Men", represent far greater diversity: "(The "Gloria" album) positively rocks with a raw energy of a band straight out of the teen clubs, playing with a total abandon and an energy level that seems to explode out of the speakers. Equal parts Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Who, and snotty little Chicago-suburb bad boys, the Shadows of Knight could easily put the torch to Chess blues classics, which make up the majority of the songs included here. Their wild takes on "I Just Want to Make Love to You," "Oh Yeah," and "I Got My Mojo Working" rank right up there with any British Invasion band's version from the same time period."

Johann Euler

Johann Albrecht Euler (27 November 1734 – 17 September 1800) was a Swiss-Russian astronomer and mathematician. Also known as "Johann Albert Euler" or "John-Albert Euler", he was the first child born to the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) who had emigrated the first time to Saint-Petersburg on 17 May 1727. His mother was Katharina Gsell (1707–1773) whose maternal grandmother was the famous scientific illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717) and whose father was the Swiss Baroque painter Georg Gsell (1673–1740) who had emigrated to Russia in 1716. Katharina married Leonhard Euler on 7 January 1734 and Johann Albert would be the eldest of their 13 children (only 5 of whom survived childhood). 
In 1754 he became a member of the Berlin Academy. In 1758, he served briefly as director of the Astronomical Calculation Institute (ARI) at the University of Heidelberg.
On Euler's return to St. Petersburg in 1765, he was appointed as the chair of physics at the St. Petersburg Academy. In St. Petersburg, he lived in his father's house; Johann Albrecht's family occupied the ground floor. He won a total of seven international academy prizes.
In 1771, Euler was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
In 1789, his youngest daughter married James Bernoulli "the younger" (1759–1789) who died two months after the wedding.

Anne Butler, Countess of Ormond

Anne Butler (née Welles), Countess of Ormond (1360 – 13 November 1397), was the first wife of Irish noble James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond, and the mother of James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. She was the first countess of Ormond to live at Kilkenny Castle, Ireland.
According to Frederick Tupper, Professor of English at the University of Vermont, she was commemorated as "Anelida, Queen of Armenia" in Geoffrey Chaucer's poem "Anelida and Arcite".
Family and lineage.
Anne Welles was born in Gainsby, Lincolnshire, England in 1360, the daughter of John de Welles, 4th Lord Welles (23 August 1334 – 11 October 1361) and Maud de Ros (died 9 December 1388). She had an elder brother John de Welles, 5th Lord Welles (born 20 April 1352), who married Eleanor de Mowbray, by whom he had issue. She had a sister Margery de Welles, who married firstly, John de Huntingfield, and secondly, Lord Scrope of Masham.
Her paternal grandparents were Sir Adam de Welles, 3rd Lord Welles and Margaret Bardolf, and her maternal grandparents were William de Ros, 2nd Lord Ros and Margery Badlesmere eldest daughter of Bartholmew de Badlesmere, 1st Lord Badlesmere and Margaret de Clare.
Marriage.
Prior to 17 June 1386, Anne Welles married James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond (died 6 September 1405), son of James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond and Elizabeth Darcy. He twice served as Lord Justice of Ireland. Upon her marriage to the earl, she assumed the title Countess of Ormond.
In September 1391, James purchased Kilkenny Castle from Hugh le Despenser, and the Ormonds subsequently made this magnificent stone fortification set in a park their chief residence with the earl using this as a base from which he ruled over the district. Previously they had lived at Gowran Castle. James and Anne hosted King Richard II when he visited Kilkenny Castle in 1395. King Richard showed his favour to the earl and countess by acting as godfather to their second son, named Richard in honour of the king. It was suggested by Frederick Tupper, Professor of English at the University of Vermont, that Anne was commemorated as "Anelida, Queen of Armenia", in Geoffrey Chaucer's poem "Anelida and Arcite" with "Arcite" having been her husband.
Issue.
James and Anne had three children:
Death.
On 26 June 1397, Anne issued a lease to Sir John Drayton, of the manor of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and rents and appurtences of the towns of Aylesbury and Burton. 
Anne Welles died on 13 November 1397, around the age of 37. 
The Earl of Ormond married secondly, Katherine FitzGerald of Desmond, by whom he had four children. The Earl had an illegitimate son, Thomas Le Boteller, Prior of Kilmainham by an unknown mistress. He is often incorrectly listed as a child of Anne Welles.

Best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in the United States

This page shows the best-selling Christmas albums in the United States. It includes artists from all over the world, but it only includes sales in the United States of America.
Prior to March 1, 1991, the only means of tracking sales figures for record albums and singles in the United States was via the certification system of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), based specifically on shipments (less potential returns) on a long-term basis. According to the most recent record album certifications, the holiday album title that has shipped the most copies in the United States is Elvis Presley's 1957 LP "Elvis' Christmas Album", which is certified by the RIAA for shipment of 13 million copies in the U.S. (three million copies of the original 1957 release on RCA Victor Records, plus ten million copies of a "budget" edition first released by RCA Camden in 1970 and then by Pickwick Records in 1975).
From March 1, 1991, through the present day, the Nielsen SoundScan tracking system has been more widely used to accurately track sales of record albums and singles at the point of sale (POS) based on inventory bar code scans.
Best-selling Christmas/holiday albums since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began.
This is a list of the thirty best-selling Christmas albums of the SoundScan era in the United States according to the Nielsen Company. Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for "Billboard" on March 1, 1991. This list includes accumulated SoundScan sales through December 17, 2012.
Best-selling Christmas/holiday albums by RIAA certification.
This is an incomplete list of the best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in the United States based on shipment certification by the RIAA. This list provides a more complete representation of the best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in history, as it includes those released well before the Nielsen/SoundScan era of music sales.
Best-selling Christmas/holiday albums by year.
In 1963, "Billboard" magazine began publishing a special weekly sales charts for Christmas album sales named "Christmas Albums" for three to four weeks during each holiday season. Titles that appeared on these charts were excluded from the regular "Billboard" 200 album sales charts. These special, year-end "Christmas Albums" charts were published from 1963 to 1973. The chart was discontinued from 1974 to 1982, when holiday titles were once again included in the regular "Billboard" 200 chart. "Christmas Albums" started up again in 1983 and appeared each year until 1985 (during these three years, holiday titles were eligible for inclusion on the weekly "Billboard" 200 chart). It was discontinued in 1986, but resumed in 1987 and continued each year under the "Christmas Albums" name until 1993. In 1994, the chart was renamed to "Holiday Albums" and has been published by "Billboard" each year since. "Billboard'"s special Christmas/holiday albums sales charts have varied in size over the years, from a low of 5 chart positions to a high of 117 chart positions.

Tardun in a small town in the Mid West region of Western Australia.
The townsite is located along the Mullewa to Wongan Hills railway line. The location of the town was decided in 1913 when the route of the railway was being planned.
The name of the town was originally Undatarra when it was gazetted in 1913, it was then changed to Tardun in 1925 and lots were surveyed in 1927.
Education.
The Christian Brothers Agricultural School, which closed in 2009, was located in Tardun.
In testimony before a British parliamentary committee investigating British child migrants sent to Australia in the late 1990s, one boy spoke of the criminal abuse he received from Catholic priests at Tardun. He testified that several of them competed to see who would be the first to rape him 100 times. They liked his blue eyes, so he repeatedly beat himself in the hope they would change colour. As parliamentarians reflected at the time, the term "sexual abuse" seemed wholly inadequate given the awfulness of his experience.

3D Indiana

3D Indiana is a commercial Educational software for teaching and research on the human anatomy. The name is an acronym for Three-Dimensional Interactive Digital Anatomy. This software 
is based 
on the principles of 
"volumetric anatomy" 
which uses three intersecting coordinate planes to locate the organs of the human body based on mathematical calculations. This is in contrast to the traditional method of describing the location of the organs in relation to one another
. The Gall bladder is traditionally described thus:
'It is situated on the right side of the body closely in contact
with the inferior surface of the liver,along the right edge of the
quadrate lobe in a shallow fossa extending from the right edge
of the porta hepatis to the inferior lobe of the liver'
History.
This patent-pending software was designed by the Kalister Foundation led by Jerome Kalister, an alumnus of TD Medical College 
, Alapuzha, Kerala, India. A team of about fifteen professionals of the Foundation worked for nearly three years to create the software. It was formally unveiled at TD Medical College, Alappuzha, by Jerome Kalister on 13 October 2008 before an audience of more than a thousand students and staff of various medical colleges in Kerala
Features.
According to its creators, 3D Indiana is a virtual human body and its use would be complementary to the conventional mode of anatomy studies. Eventually this software may replace the human cadavers in anatomical studies. Without any additional programming, a researcher could elicit normal body responses from this virtual body. This gives the package the potential as a tool for doing clinical trials of drugs and chemicals in it.
Every named structure in the body is digitally recreated in detail and deployed in their true anatomical positions in the body. By clicking on any part of the body using a computer mouse, the user can get the name of the part displayed and can zoom in, rotate or isolate the part for further details.
Endorsements.
The 3D Indiana package has been already endorsed by the Anatomical society of India
. The Kalister Foundation is in discussion with the National Rural Health Mission for its endorsement of 3D Indiana as an educational software suitable for application in medical colleges.

<doc id="19788401" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19788401" title="Transformative mediation">
Transformative mediation

Transformative mediation describes a unique approach to conflict intervention that was first articulated by Robert A. Baruch Bush and Joseph P. Folger in 1994 in The Promise of Mediation. It has been the subject of much study, research and development ever since.
As summarized by Della Noce, Bush & Folger (2002), the transformative approach to mediation practice takes an essentially social / communicative view of human conflict. According to this model, a conflict represents first and foremost a crisis in some human interaction—an interactional crisis with a somewhat common and predictable character. Specifically, the occurrence of conflict tends to destabilize the parties' experience of both self and other, so that the parties interact in ways that are both more vulnerable and more self-absorbed than they did before the conflict. Further, these negative dynamics often feed into each other on all sides as the parties interact, in a vicious circle that intensifies each party's sense of weakness and self-absorption. As a result, the interaction between the parties quickly degenerates and assumes a mutually destructive, alienating, and dehumanizing character. For most people, according to transformative theory, being caught in this kind of destructive interaction is the most significant negative impact of conflict. However, the transformative model posits that, despite conflict's potentially destructive impacts on interaction, people have the capacity to change the quality of their interactions to reflect relative personal strength or self-confidence (the empowerment shift) and relative openness or responsiveness to the other (the recognition shift). Moreover, as these positive dynamics feed into each other, the interaction can regenerate and assume a constructive, connecting, and humanizing character. The model assumes that the transformation of the interaction itself is what matters most to parties in conflict -even more than settlement on favorable terms. Therefore, the theory defines the mediator's goal as helping the parties to identify opportunities for empowerment and recognition shifts as they arise in the parties' conversation, to choose whether and how to act upon these opportunities, and thus to change their interaction from destructive to constructive (Bush & Pope, 2002).
In transformative mediation, success is measured not by settlement per se but by party shifts toward personal strength, interpersonal responsiveness and constructive interaction. As parties talk together and listen to each other, they build new understandings of themselves and their situation, critically examine the possibilities, and make their own decisions. Those decisions can include settlement agreements, but no one is coerced into any decision or agreement. The outcomes are entirely in the parties’ own hands and subject to their own choices. Effective mediator practice is focused on supporting empowerment and recognition shifts, by allowing and encouraging party deliberation and decision-making, and inter-party perspective-taking, in various ways. A competent transformative mediator practices with a microfocus on communication, identifying opportunities for empowerment and recognition as those opportunities appear in the parties' own conversations, and responding in ways that provide an opening for parties to choose what, if anything, to do with them.
The transformative framework is based on and reflects relational ideology, in which human beings are assumed to be fundamentally social—formed in and through their relations with other human beings, essentially connected to others, and motivated by a desire for both personal autonomy and constructive social interaction (Bush & Folger, 1994; Della Noce, 1999).

<doc id="19788423" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19788423" title="Overture (software)">
Overture (software)

Overture is a music scorewriter program for Windows and Macintosh platforms, written by Don Williams. Visually, the Overture interface resembles Encore, another notation program originally by the same author. However, Overture is the first scorewriter program to feature full Virtual Studio Technology (VST) hosting; the software also plays MIDI files.
Current version.
Overture is, as of July 2011, currently up to version 4.1.5.
Editing.
In Overture, input of note data can be done by any of several methods: QWERTY keyboard, mouse, step entry MIDI keyboard recording, or real-time MIDI keyboard recording. Most notational symbols can be repositioned simply by dragging them with the mouse. Most other editing of notational symbols is performed by selecting the symbols using the mouse, and selecting the appropriate editing command from a menu or by clicking on a palette. MIDI data is edited in a special graphical view, where each note appears as a bar on a piano roll. Editing is done simply by adjusting the bars by dragging with the mouse.
Background and Notability.
Because of the complexity of producing musical scores to publishers' standards, it took a long time for scorewriter software capable of producing professional-quality scores containing complex or non-standard notation to be developed.
In the early 1990s, the music notation software market was dominated by the Finale program, published by Coda. It was capable of handling large, complicated scores and non-traditional notation. However, its immense power and flexibility came at the expense of making the software, as it was then, extremely difficult to learn to use, due to its large number of operating modes. Different musical markings could only be edited when the user had first selected the appropriate editing mode, making editing a laborious task in comparison to more recent versions of Finale or other programs. 
At the same time, a number of music scoring programs with more intuitive user interfaces became available, of which Encore became the most popular. Encore was first published by Passport Designs, and featured the ability to add notes simply by clicking on a staff with the mouse pointer, and most notational elements could be selected using the mouse.
A notable survey of this situation, and the music notation software of the time (largely dominated by programs for the Macintosh), was published by Professor Alan Belkin of the University of Montreal. Among other issues, it pointed out the differences between these two approaches to scorewriter software design, and the problems associated with each approach.
In an effort to produce a music notation program that was user-friendly and had powerful features, Overture was based on Encore's intuitive interface, and became the first easy-to-use WYSIWYG notation package capable of producing large complex scores and handling non-standard music notation (such as noteheads with non-standard shapes, or staves with other than five lines).)
Overture is also notable for being the first music notation software which gave the user control over all MIDI playback data, invisible on the score (such as note velocity, pitch bend and duration). The software introduced a MIDI data editing view where the notes appear as strips on a scrolling piano roll, and can be moved and edited using the mouse.
The program was one of the first music notation packages to always show the score in WYSIWYG page view. Most previous music notation packages either lacked this, or swapped between a scrolling editing view and a page view used for print previews or certain editing functions.
Publisher.
Overture was originally published by Opcode Systems. It was later published by Cakewalk. As of 2009, it is published by Sonic Scores (previously named Geniesoft), in both boxed and downloadable versions. A less-expensive, scaled-down version of Overture, called Score Writer, is also published. Demonstration versions of both Overture and Score Writer are available at the Sonic Scores website.

<doc id="19788452" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19788452" title="Kwisa">
Kwisa

The Kwisa () is a river in south-western Poland, a left tributary of the Bóbr, which itself is a left tributary of the Oder river. 
It rises in the Izera Mountains, part of the Western Sudetes range, where it runs along the border with the Czech Republic. At the slope of the Smrk massif it turns northwards, flowing along the towns of Świeradów-Zdrój, Mirsk, Gryfów Śląski, Leśna, where it is dammed at the Lake Leśnia reservoir, to Lubań, Nowogrodziec and Kliczków. It finally joins the Bóbr river approximately north-west of Małomice and south-east of Żagań. For most of its length it is in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, but it also flows through Lubusz Voivodeship for several kilometres before reaching its mouth.
Border river.
From about 937 the southeastern outskirts of the Saxon "Marca Geronis", established in the conquered lands settled by the West Slavic Milceni tribes, reached to the left banks of the Kwisa. After the partition of the march in 965, the lands west of the river belonged to the Imperial Margraviate of Meissen, while the adjacent territory to the east was gradually incorporated into the Silesian region of the Early Polish state under the Piast duke Mieszko I until 992. His successor Bolesław I Chrobry further extended the Polish reach of power to the west, campaigning the Milceni lands around Bautzen ("Budissin"), which after several years of German-Polish struggle Emperor Henry II the Saint ceded to him according to the 1018 Peace of Bautzen. 
Nevertheless the "Land Budissin", later called Upper Lusatia, was reconquered by Emperor Conrad II in 1031 and again held by the Meissen margraves until King Henry IV of Germany in 1071 enfeoffed Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia, his ally in the looming Saxon Rebellion. The Bohemian rule was again confirmed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in favour of Duke Vladislaus II in 1158, accompanied by the royal title. Meanwhile the territory east of the Kwisa had been incorporated into the Polish Duchy of Silesia in 1138, which after the Emperor's 1163 expedition to Poland was held by the Silesian Piast descendants of Duke Władysław II the Exile. From that time on the river marked the border between the historical regions of Lower Silesia—i.e. the Duchy of Legnica from 1248, the Duchy of Jawor from 1274—in the east and Upper Lusatia in the west. 
Together with the lower Bóbr, the Kwisa was therefore one of the rivers considered as a possible marker of the Polish–German border after World War II during the negotiations at the 1945 Potsdam Conference, that finally led to the establishment of the Oder–Neisse line about 50 km (30 mi) to the west.

Leonidas Hubbard

Leonidas Hubbard Jr. (1872–1903) was a journalist and adventurer.
He was born in Michigan and studied at the University of Michigan (1893–97), choosing journalism as a career. In 1901 he married Mina Adelaine Benson, a woman two years senior and at the time an assistant superintendent of a Staten Island hospital. They met at the hospital when Hubbard was ill with typhoid fever. He became an assistant editor of "Outing" magazine and in 1903 led an expedition to canoe the system Naskaupi River - Lake Michikamau in Labrador and George River in Quebec. His companions on this journey were his friend, New York lawyer Dillon Wallace and an Indian guide from Missannabie, George Elson.
Ill-fated expedition.
From the start (departing North West River on July 15), the expedition was beset with mistakes and problems. Instead of ascending the Naskaupi River, by mistake they followed the shallow Susan Brook. After hard long portaging and almost reaching Lake Michikamau, with food supplies running out, on September 15 at Windbound lake, they decided to turn back. On October 18, Wallace and Elson went in a search of cached store of flour, leaving Hubbard behind in a tent. Hubbard died of exhaustion and starvation on either same or next day. Wallace got lost in the snowstorm, while Elson, after a week of bushwhacking, building raft to cross swollen rivers (with no ax), reached the nearest occupied cabin. A search party found Wallace alive on October 30, 1903.
After Wallace was nursed back to health (he suffered gangrene in his foot), the two men accompanied Hubbard's body back to New York for burial in May 1904.
In 1905, Mina Hubbard and Dillon Wallace led two competitive expeditions from North West River to the Hudson's Bay Company post at the mouth of George River. Both were successful. George Elson accompanied Mina Hubbard.
In 1913, Wallace returned with Judge William Malone and Gilbert Blake to place a memorial plaque where his friend perished (). Their canoe overturned on Beaver River and the plaque was lost. Wallace then created a memorial using white paint and a brush made from Gilbert's hair. In July 1977, with the assistance of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, Dillon Wallace III, the son of Hubbard's companion, and Rudy Mauro placed a replica of the lost plaque on the inscribed stone at Hubbard's last camp. The inscription reads:

Pernambuco Foliage-gleaner

The Pernambuco Foliage-gleaner ("Automolus lammi") is a species of bird in the Furnariidae family. It is found in forests of north-eastern Brazil. Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the White-eyed Foliage-gleaner. The morphology of the two is very similar, but their voices differ significantly. Following the split, the Pernambuco Foliage-gleaner has not been rated by BirdLife International, but as it is restricted to a region with extensive habitat destruction, its status gives cause for concern.

Howlett (London cricketer)

Howlett (dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played for London Cricket Club during the 1740s.
Career.
Howlett is mentioned in 1744 and 1745. On Saturday, 2 June 1744, he played for London against Slindon in the earliest match that has a surviving scorecard. On Wednesday, 26 June 1745, he played for R Newland's XI versus Long Robin's XI. 
As Howlett had established his reputation by 1744, he must have been active for some years previously and his career probably began in the 1730s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Howlett.

European Parliamentary Union

The European Parliamentary Union (EPU) was a private organization set up by Count Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who was also its Secretary General.
It held its preliminary conference on 4–5 July 1947 at Gstaad, Switzerland, and followed it with its first full conference from 8 to 12 September.
Kalergi’s aim was to draft a European Constitution. The EPU asked some 4000 members of Parliament of 13 European countries to decide for or against a European Federation in the framework of the United Nations. The project was criticized by Denis de Rougemont and Duncan Sandys, son-in-law of Winston Churchill, founder of the European Movement, who advocated a model based on an intergovernmental co-operation without any loss of national sovereignty.
The EPU played a prominent role in the Congress of the Hague, 7–10 May 1948.
The second EPU Congress was held from 1 to 5 September 1948 in Interlaken, Switzerland.
On 20 September 1949, the EPU met for the third time in Venice and voted a resolution in favour of greater European political integration and an extension of the powers of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, which had just been established. In 1949, the British MP Kim Mackay became chair of the EPU.
The creation of the Council of Europe resulted in a loss of influence for the EPU, since European parliaments now had their own intergovernmental forum in Strasbourg.
On 18 May 1950, Kalergi was the first person to be awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen. In 19.-20 June 1950, Rheinfelden, Switzerland, the EPU organised a Conference of German and French Parliamentarians
Shortly afterwards, the EPU was merged with the European Movement. 
Kalergi was elected honorary president of the European Movement in 1952.

Ralph Seagraves

William Ralph Seagraves (April 21, 1929 – September 27, 1998) was an American executive. For 13 years he was the president of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company’s Special Events Operations (now Sports Marketing Enterprises). His help in introducing Winston cigarette advertising into NASCAR and National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) lead him to be inducted in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2008. 
Career.
Seagraves, born in Wilkes County, started with R. J. Reynolds (RJR) in 1955 as a salesman. By the late 1960s he was a division manager. He attended a 1969 R. J. Reynolds meeting where they discussed how to promote their tobacco with the April 1970 Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act prohibiting television and radio advertisements. NASCAR owner Junior Johnson suggested that RJR sponsor his team. Seagraves suggested that RJR should sponsor the entire league. The sponsorship resulted in NASCAR renaming their premiere series from the Grand National Series to the Winston Cup Series. RJR created the Special Events Operations division to find creative ways to promote the tobacco, and placed Seagraves in charge in 1972. After signing the deal, Reynolds had NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. change the schedule to remove the most of the shortest tracks from the schedule so it could concentrate its marketing on larger crowds at larger tracks. Remaining events were over 250 miles long, and the number of races was reduced from 47 to 31. Seagraves hired apprentice T. Wayne Robertson to take a show car to local events such as shopping malls. Robertson brought along a sign with the current NASCAR points leaders and the location of the next event. Seagraves talked with RJR management and they agree to increase to three show cars on display within 150 miles of the upcoming event to promote NASCAR and Reynolds.
Seagraves promoted the product in other sports, including golf, hydroplane racing, soccer (football), and tennis. RJR sponsored racetracks to upgrade their facilities, notably NASCAR Winston Racing Series short tracks throughout the United States. Tracks were given red and white paint and told to paint their safety walls alternating red and white to give the illusion of greater speed. Some tracks were on the verge of bankruptcy, and the sponsorship helped them and NASCAR survive. He also helped racing teams to find sponsors. In 1982, he urged Piedmont Airlines to become Richard Childress Racing's first sponsor. He retired in 1985. He was succeeded by T. Wayne Robertson.
Death.
Seagraves died on September 27, 1998. He was survived by his wife Ardette and son Colbert. Upon his death, NHRA president Dallas Gardner said "Ralph was certainly the patriarch of motorsports' sponsorships, but Ralph's real legacy is that he always considered R.J. Reynolds as a partner in building motorsports, not (just) a sponsor. His contribution to the success of NHRA is immeasurable. We will miss him."
Career awards.
Besides his International Motorsports Hall of Fame induction, he was inducted in the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame in 1992 and the International Drag Racing Hall of Fame in 1993.

Gerry Monroe

Gerry Monroe (20 January 1933 – October 1989) was an English pop singer, who enjoyed brief popularity in the early 1970s.
Born Henry Morris in South Shields, Tyne & Wear, England, Monroe scored five Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart in 1970-71. He was spotted on Hughie Green's "Opportunity Knocks" TV show by Les Reed, who signed him to a long-term deal with Chapter One Records. He had a high and distinctive falsetto voice, and managed to notch up chart hits for the Chapter One label, including "Sally", a song first made popular by Gracie Fields in the 1930s. Monroe's version was co-produced and co-arranged by Reed. In 1997 an album, "Sally: Pride of Our Alley", was released on compact disc on the Gold Dust label. Monroe also recorded a tribute to Bobby Charlton in 1973, following the footballer's retirement, called "Goodbye Bobby Boy".
Monroe died in October 1989 at the age of 54.
