Francis Joseph Lee

Francis Joseph Lee ("c." 1857, London – 12 September 1909, London) was an English chess master.
Chess career.
Lee played in a number of matches, and British and international chess tournaments, between 1883 and 1907. In the Master Section of the 3rd British Chess Federation (BCF) Congress at London 1887 (won by Amos Burn and Isidor Gunsberg, he finished 6th out of 10 players, scoring 3.5 out of a possible 9 points. In the Master Section at the 4th BCF Championship at Bradford 1888 (won by Gunsberg), he finished 14th of 17 players, scoring 5 of a possible 16 points. In a tournament held at Simpson's Divan in London in 1888, he finished 9th of 18 players, scoring 9 out a possible 17 points. That same year, he lost a match to Gunsberg at Bradford, scoring just two draws in five games. In the Master Section of the 5th BCF Congress at London 1889, he finished 6th-8th of 11 players, scoring 5 out of a possible 10 points. In the Master Section of the 6th BCF Congress at Manchester 1890 (won by Siegbert Tarrasch), he finished 12th-13th out of 20, scoring 9 of a possible 19 points. In an 1890 match in London, Lee had what Chessmetrics considers his best result, losing a match to Joseph Henry Blackburne (2 wins, 6 draws, 6 losses).
Lee also lost matches to Emanuel Lasker (0.5 : 1.5) at London 1891, Richard Teichmann (3.5 : 5.5) at London 1898 and (2.5 : 5.5) at London 1901, and won two matches against Henry Bird (8 : 5 and 5 : 3) at London 1897. He also participated in two cable matches between England and the United States in 1901 and 1902.
Lee took 4th at Belfast 1892 ("Quadrangular"), shared 3rd at New York 1893 (Lasker won with a perfect score), tied for 10-11th at Barmen 1905 (B tournament, Leo Fleischmann won), and tied for 25-26th at Ostend 1907 chess tournament (Masters' Tournament, Ossip Bernstein and Akiba Rubinstein won).
Lee won the South African Chess Championship in 1903. He participated in British Chess Championships at Hastings 1904, Shrewsbury 1906, Tunbridge Wells 1908, and Scarborough 1909. He died on 12 September 1909, at the age of 52.
Chess books.
Lee and George H. D. Gossip co-wrote the books "The Chess Player's Mentor" (1895) and "The Complete Chess-Guide" (1903). The latter was in effect a much-expanded version of the former, containing "Chess Player's Mentor" (Part I), "Modern Chess Brilliancies" (Part II), "Guide to the Openings" (Part III), and "Games at Odds" (Part IV).
Chess strength.
By Arpad Elo's calculation, Lee's strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2450. Another assessment system, Chessmetrics, calculates that at his peak in February 1898 Lee's play was equivalent to a rating of 2598, and he was the number 25 player in the world. According to Chessmetrics, his highest world rank was number 24 in the world in July 1897.

The Sophia Centre

The Sophia Centre was founded in the School of Historical and Cultural Studies at Bath Spa University in 2002, as the first University centre in the world to teach cultural astronomy (defined as "the study of the application of beliefs about the stars to all aspects of human culture, from religion and science to the arts and literature") and the history and culture of astrology.
Background and current status.
In 2004 Michael York, the Centre’s director, was appointed the world’s first professor of cultural astronomy and astrology. In 2008 the Centre transferred to the University of Wales, Lampeter. The Centre is now in the Department of Archaeology, History and Anthropology at the renamed University of Wales Trinity Saint David (formed by the merger of the University of Wales, Lampeter and the Trinity College Carmarthen.
The current director of the Sophia Centre is Nicholas Campion. The Centre’s teaching, via the MA in Cultural Astronomy and Astrology, is based in a wide view of astronomy and astrology as providing a framework for culture, and the analysis of the way in which cosmos provides a reference for human activity. The Centre began teaching Archaeoastronomy in 2010 and holds an annual conference from which several volumes of proceedings have been published (see below).
Publications.
The Centre is associated with the Sophia Centre Press and publishes the bi-annual journal, "Culture and Cosmos".
Volumes of conference proceedings include:

Restless (Elton John song)

"Restless" is a song by Elton John with lyrics by Bernie Taupin. It was the opening track off his 1984 album, "Breaking Hearts".
Musical structure.
The song is basically a rock and roll song. A steady 4/4 beat drives the song, accompagnied by guitar solo and bass that follows the piano pattern. The studio version features a heavy load of synthesizers, giving the song a more 'updated' feel than the original demo, which was more piano-driven. The song is more than five minutes long, which got panned by critics as it is very similar throughout the whole song.
Lyrical meaning.
The song is almost political. At the time of its release, it was the height of the Cold War, and the lyrics describe that the people are ""Searching for something that just ain't there"". There are also mentions of that the "Walls have ears" and "Big Brother's watching". This links to the novel, "Nineteen Eighty-Four", in which both lines actually exists, curiously in the same year as the song was released. It could also be a pun on the German Democratic Republic, which at the time had surveillance similar to that of the novel. Taupin also writes that they're ""Breaking down doors in foreign countries"", which was the fall of communism. It had begun to take place shortly after the song's release.
Performances.
The song was performed for the first time in the spring of 1984. It was a live staple up and until 1986. On stage John would often introduce the song as a "rock and roll number", and the live versions are much faster and piano-based than the studio version. One of the live versions were eventually released as the B-side to "Wrap Her Up", and now appears as one of the bonus tracks on his next album, 1985's "Ice on Fire".
The song appeared in the episode "To Hull and Back" of "Only Fools and Horses" in a scene set in the Nag's Head at the beginning. The song starts playing while Uncle Albert is talking to his female friend and can still be heard when Boycie and Dell are in the back room.

Zamba Zembola (born c. 1780) is the author of an 1847 narrative, "The Life and Adventures of Zamba, an African Negro King; and his Experience of Slavery in South Carolina", which describes his kidnapping and 40 years of labor as a slave on a plantation in the U.S. state of South Carolina.
Early life and slavery.
Born in Congo, Zebola was in his twenties when he befriended Captain Winton, one of the Western traders with whom his father the king did business. Winton provided Zebola with an education and eventually with passage on his slave ship to America. A free man, Zebola recorded the squalid conditions in which the slaves were kept. Upon his arrival to the United States, he lost his freedom when he was seized and sold into slavery. Forced to work for over 40 years on a plantation in South Carolina, he published his autobiography "The Life and Adventures of Zamba, an African King" in 1847, after obtaining his freedom.

Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book

Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book is an artist's book by the English artist Mark Pawson, originally published in early 1992. Originally consisting of 36 full-size reproductions of British AC power plug wiring diagrams printed in various colours, the book has become celebrated as an example of English sociological art, and is sometimes referred to as part of the "New Folk Archive".
Online gallery Hayvend described it: "the ultra-obsessive "die cut plug wiring diagram book" part of an avalanche of essential ephemera by unashamed image junkie Mark Pawson".
'Many of the items produces are made out of his or other people's waste material including comics, flyers, glossy fashion magazines, children's colouring books, braille hymn books, antique paper, wood-chip wallpaper and the odd pornographic magazine. Pawson's most successful pieces are usually made of the most simple materials.' 
Things to collect.
Pawson started to collect ephemera as a child, starting his collection with Wade animals, aimed squarely at unattached pocket money. Early artist's books to continue the theme included "Small Plastic Babies", 1987, collecting together his collection of small plastic babies, "Eco-Frenzy", 1992, collecting over 150 recycling and ecology symbols and "Moustaches", also 1992, in which Pawson documented his clip=on moustaches. The collection of plug wiring diagrams was originally published at the same time as these last two, but unlike the others has been continuously in print since.
"I collect things for my own amusement and decoration. Every so often a group of objects will push their way to the forefront and demand to be taken a bit more seriously." Mark Pawson 
Pawson made his first artist's book whilst studying sociology at City University, London, 1983-84 and has continued his interest in ephemera since. Pawson has become a central figure of UK mail art, and has also participated widely in the emerging worldwide network of artist's bookfairs. "Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book" has been exhibited widely, and is in various public collections including MOMA and Tate.
The book itself.
The first edition of "Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book" is a small softback book containing 36 photocopied plug wiring diagrams, mostly in colour using different coloured toners in monochrome photocopiers; 3 full colour photocopies have been tipped in as well. The 'de-luxe version' of the book is sewn together using different coloured threads that mimic electrical wiring, whilst the ordinary edition is stapled. The 'de-luxe' version sold for £3.00, twice the asking price of the stapled version. The cover is a grainy photocopy of the back of a plug diagram with three holes cut into it (where the pins would go). There is a brief essay at the end by Pawson discussing his collection of plugs, and their essential Britishness. The last page lists credits of 'contributing electricians'.
Later editions of the work acquired a piece of electrical tape bound inside the cover, more images of plugs, as well as adverts for other related commodities made by Pawson. The book has been continually reprinted and updated, and is still available. It currently sells for £5.00. The words "Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book" only actually appear at the end of the book, in the body of text of Pawson's afterword; the title has instead been acquired, in the main from references to the work on Pawson's website.
Reception.
The book has been included in a number of overviews of contemporary English culture, including "Creative Review", "Experimental Layout" and "The New Handmade Graphics". The book is in various public collections including Tate, V&A, and MOMA.

Erasmus James Philipps

Erasmus James Philipps (April 23, 1705 – September 26, 1760) was a soldier and political figure in Nova Scotia. He was a member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1759 to 1760.
He was an ensign in the 40th Regiment of Foot stationed in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1727, he went to Beaubassin under order from lieutenant governor Lawrence Armstrong to administer an oath of loyalty to Britain to the Acadians there; the Acadians refused to comply. In 1730, Philipps was named to Nova Scotia's Council. He became a Freemason while working on a commission to resolve boundaries in New England and, in 1739, became provincial grand master for Nova Scotia; Philipps founded the first Masonic lodge in Canada at Annapolis Royal. When war broke out between France and England in 1744, Philipps looked after providing accommodation and supplies for the troops in the Grand-Pré area. He returned to Annapolis Royal after the French attack. When the provincial legislature was reorganized in 1749, Philipps was named to the new Council. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1759 but died in office of apoplexy in Halifax the following year at the age of 55.

Five or Six

Five or Six was a UK post-punk band, originally signed to Cherry Red Records by A&R head Mike Alway, who deemed them to be the act with the most potential from the scene he had helped create around the Snoopies club in south-west London. The line-up was fluid, and apart from their key contribution to the best-selling compilation album "Pillows & Prayers", they are perhaps most notable for the various activities of most former members.

Eroica (1949 film)

Eroica is a 1949 Austrian film depicting composer Ludwig van Beethoven's life and work. The film is directed by Walter Kolm-Veltée, produced by Guido Bagier with Walter Kolm-Veltée and written by Walter Kolm-Veltée with Franz Tassié. It was entered into the 1949 Cannes Film Festival.
Plot.
An express messenger rides to Vienna and reports at a ball given by Count Lichnowsky that Napoleon Bonaparte is approaching Vienna with his troops. The news spreads like wildfire in the city and also reaches Beethoven, who, together with his friends, is sitting in the tavern. Beethoven is very enthusiastic about the ideals embodied by Napoleon after the French Revolution. He hurries home to write a powerful and glorious symphony - which later becomes famous as Beethoven's "Eroica" - for Napoleon. After the symphony is successful, two messengers from Napoleon come to see Beethoven. They request Beethoven to participate in a reception given by the French emperor. Favouring the glamour, Napoleon has elaborated detailed clothing instructions for Beethoven. Beethoven is disappointed by his idol's superficiality and deletes the dedication to Napoleon from the title page of the symphony.
For his safety, Beethoven travels to Hungary and finds quarters at the aristocratic home of his pupil Therese van Brunswik and her cousin Giulietta Guicciardi. Beethoven falls in love with Giulietta, who is even willing to leave her fiancé for Beethoven. This interpretation of Beethoven's life is distorted, however, as it was in 1800, four years earlier, that Beethoven actually met Giulietta. In the film story, Therese thinks that, due to his talent, it is not Beethoven's destiny to lead a fulfilling relationship with a woman.
Beethoven not only worries about his nephew Karl whom he thinks is leading a dissolute life and is under his mother's harmful influence but also becomes aware of a worsening of his hearing abilities. As Beethoven despairs of a reason why God would want to deprive him off his hearing, Beethoven's friend Amenda replies that Beethoven's destiny is to compose a type of music never heard before. It is saddening for Beethoven to learn during rehearsals for his opera "Fidelio" that the musicians cannot follow his "conducting", and in fact are actually following their music director instead. In a depressed mood, Beethoven goes home and once more speaks with God, as Amenda's words come to his mind. When Therese comes to look after him, he comes to terms with his destiny and begins to compose again.

Doris Keane

Doris Keane (December 12, 1881 - November 25, 1945) was an American actress.
Biography.
Early life and family.
She was born in the St. Joseph, Michigan to Joseph Keane and Minnie Florence Winter, a comedienne. Doris was educated largely in Europe.
Career.
Her first professional role was in "Whitewashing Julia" in 1903. This was a small role but she went on to play leading roles in "The Happy Marriage" in 1909 and "The Lights o' London" in 1911.
In 1913, she played Margherita Cavallini in Edward Sheldon's "Romance". Her leading man in this long running play was William Courtenay who played the part of a priest. Sheldon had originally offered the male lead to his friend John Barrymore. Barrymore turned it down preferring to still do comedies. Sheldon reportedly fell in love with her and yearned for her all his life. She played this part in America and Europe for the next five years and returned in revivals regularly during the 1920s. In 1920, she made a silent film of "Romance" distributed by the then newly formed United Artists. Her male lead in the film was Norman Trevor. She also played Catherine the Great in "Czarina" in 1922 after Sheldon had revised the play especially for her.
She married the actor Basil Sydney, thirteen years her junior, in 1918; they divorced in 1925. She had one child, Ronda Keane, born in Cannes, France in 1915. Ronda's father was the financier Howard Gould. He acknowledged his paternity but never married Doris. Ronda married Dr Carl Muschenheim, a New York based thoracic specialist, in 1951. 
Doris Keane was an avid reader, leaving behind an extensive library including The Upanishads. She was a favorite subject for artists of the day, among them the sculptor Jacob Epstein and the portraitist De Laszlo. There are at least two Royal Dalton figurines of her, one holding the monkey that was part of the 'Romance' play.

Dutch Cottage

The Dutch Cottage is an octagonal-shaped cottage located in Rayleigh, Essex. It is both the smallest and the oldest council house in the United Kingdom, and takes its name from the association of this type of house with the seventeenth century Dutch immigrants who constructed many of the sea walls of the south Essex coast.
The cottage's history is the subject of dispute. Above the front door is an inscription which reads "1621", suggesting its year of construction. Nevertheless, surveyors, architects and historians who have studied the cottage have opined that it was not built until the eighteenth century, more specifically around 1740.
The unusual octagonal structure is said to serve several functions. It is strong, relatively easy to thatch, and provides the occupants with a more panoramic view. Also, for the superstitious, the lack of right angles prevented evil spirits from lurking in wait around a corner.
Owners Rochford District Council opened the cottage to residential tenant applicants in 2008 for £75 per week in rent, on condition that they would make the property available for pre-arranged guided tours every Wednesday afternoon.

SZD-21 Kobuz

The SZD-21 Kobuz was a single-seat aerobatic glider designed and built in Poland at "Szybowcowy Zakład Doświadczalny" (Glider Experimental Works) in Bielsko-Biała from 1958.
Development.
The SZD-21 was a successor to the IS-4 Jastrząb. Development began in January 1958 as the SZD-21 Sokół, but due to problems with the flying surfaces and a wood metal sandwich, a construction of the design was restarted as the SZD-21 Kobuz ("Eurasian Hobby"). The new SZD-21 retained the overall shape of the original project, but was constructed with wood throughout, using multiple spars for the wings. Design team was headed by Jerzy Trzeciak, later joined by M. Gracz in Kobuz 3 constructing.
Flight testing of the SZD-21 Kobuz began in June 1961 with Stanisław Skrzydlewski at the controls, but the results were disappointing prompting a re-build as the SZD-21-2A, with revised landing gear, canopy and differential ailerons. Flight tests resumed on in May 1962, but serious problems with the pitch and roll stability at high speed as well as flutter in a certain speed range prompted a further round of modifications. The resulting SZD-21-2AZ (still registered as SP-1990) continued the test program until 20 April 1963, when the aircraft broke up in flight during flutter testing, killing the pilot Sławomir Makaruk.
The final version, the SZD-21-2B Kobuz 3, which was of all wood construction with very stiff wings to resist bending and flutter, was produced in small numbers in Wrocław. It competed at the highest levels into the late 1980s. Unfortunately, the Kobuz 3 was not immune to accidents and one high profile fatal accident, at the world glider aerobatic championships at Hockenheim in Germany, high-lighted problems with condensation soaking highly stressed wooden parts causing structural failure. The pilot, Krzysztof Wyskiel, was carrying out his competition routine with high accuracy until the penultimate manoeuvre when the wings failed, clapping hands above the fuselage which shot straight down to the ground like an arrow, killing Krzysztof Wyskiel instantly. The three remaining Kobuz 3's in the competition were grounded and remained so until the aircraft were cleared for limited manoeuvres only, curtailing their aerobatic competition careers.
In 1991 the design of a new (composite build) aerobatic glider, S-1 Swift had been finished, based on the Kobuz 3 design (the wings of the first production series of the Swift glider had been manufactured using the wings of Kobus 3 as molds).

Their suspects include an old tramp, a dismissed servant, a hostile colleague, and the housekeeper. They find certain clues: Broken-down nettles in a ditch, a footprint in a grassy field, jet planes (by Mr. Hick’s seeing). 
The children realise that as Mr Hick claims to have been in the London train when the cottage was burnt, but by his own report he saw the planes which flew over the village at the same time, he is contradicting himself. Fatty finds out that the cottage and the burnt papers Mr Hick describes as 'most important' were insured. The children deduce that Mr Hick burnt his own cottage for the insurance money.

Charles Henry Turner (painter)

Charles Henry Francis Turner (7 August 1848 – 24 November 1908) was an American watercolourist and oil painter of landscapes, portraits, illustrations, and genre scenes, who from 1877 studied with Otto Grundmann (1844–1890), founder of the "Boston School", at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School. Turner was a member of the Unity Art Club and the Boston Art Club, of which he later became president.
Turner was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, but lived and worked in Jackson, New Hampshire and Boston, Massachusetts and exhibited in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York. 
In the 1880s he spent some time studying and working in Europe, later joining the White Mountain School of painting.
Turner produced some fine, detailed pyrographic artworks. On his trip to the Continent, he was inspired by European and French master paintings and portraits. His love of portrait painting and exposure to early French pyrography, led to his interest in this art form. He created three known pyrographic portraits of European ladies together with a pyrographically decorated oak blanket chest, inscribed on the lid: "This chest decorated in pyrography by me Charles H.F. Turner for my grand daughter Elise 1901".
Family.
Charles Henry's father was Henry W. Turner of Boston, and his mother was Sarah A. Goss (b. 28 August 1828 in Hampton, New Hampshire). After his mother's death Charles Henry was raised in Hampton by his mother's parents, William and Theodate Goss.
Charles Henry married Elise Clementina Augusta Hagedorn (b. Stadthagen, Germany) and they had two children, both born in Boston: Gertrude Hagedorn Turner and Charles Mallord Turner.
He died in Boston.

Hartbeesfontein

Hartbeesfontein (or Hartebeesfontein) is a settlement near Klerksdorp, in the North West province of South Africa. It is situated at the intersection of the R503 and R507 routes.
Geology.
The town is situated on an ancient geological feature known as the Hartbeesfontein basin (or KOSH basin), which is the source of the gold found on its southern rim. Underground water occurs in abundance in dolomitic aquifers of the region. When the water is however allowed to seep into mines it is oxidised and polluted by the exposed iron pyrites. As of 2005 when Buffelsfontein mine went out of business, it became a burden on the remaining mines to keep the interconnected tunnels free of water.
History.
A small pass above town, Hartebeesfontein Poort, was the scene of a Boer War skirmish on February 17, 1901. The British forces, a contingent of Lord Methuen led by Captain Poison, were descending the 500 ft escarpment above town, when they were confronted by entrenched Boer forces of about double their number. From dawn to 10 o'clock the forces were deadlocked, when Lord Methuen ordered two companies of Major Murray's convoy guard to occupy a strategic position. After some dozens of soldiers were killed on each side, the British secured the pass and captured ample Boer supplies of stock and grain.

Klinkenberg correction

Under steady state and laminar flow condition, Klinkenberg demonstrated that the permeability to gases is approximately a linear function of the reciprocal pressure.
When Klinkenberg defined the interactions to be considered, he supposed the existence of a layer (sometimes called Knudsen layer), thinner than molecular mean free path, adjacent to the pore’s wall where only molecules-wall collisions would occur and collisions among molecules could be ignored. Thus the slippage velocity, as obtained from the Klinkenberg’s approach, captures the contribution of molecule-wall interactions and when this velocity is zero, the Poiseuille velocity profile (which results from molecule-molecule interactions) is recovered. However, Klinkenberg’s formulation ignores the transition flow region, where neither molecule-molecule nor molecule-wall interactions can be neglected because both are playing a relevant role. The feasibility of Klinkenberg linear function of the reciprocal pressure depends on the Knudsen number. For Knudsen numbers from 0.01 to 0.1 the Klinkenberg approach is acceptable.
In petroleum engineering, a Klinkenberg correction is a procedure for calibration of permeability data obtained from a minipermeameter device. A more accurate correction factor can be obtained using Knudsen correction. When using nitrogen gas for core plug measurements, the Klinkenberg correction is usually necessary due to the so-called Klinkenberg gas slippage effect.This takes place when the pore space approaches the mean free path of the gas
Permeability is measured in the laboratory by encasing a core plug of known length and diameter in an air-tight sleeve (the Hassler Sleeve). A fluid of known viscosity is injected into the core plug while mounted in a steel chamber. The samples are either full diameter core samples that are intervals of whole core cut, typically 6 inches long, or 1-in plugs drilled from the cores. The pressure drop across the sample and the flow rate are measured and permeability is calculated using Darcy's law.
Normally, either nitrogen or brine can be used as a fluid. When high rates of flow can be maintained, the results are comparable. At low rates, air permeability will be higher than brine permeability. This is because gas does not adhere to the pore walls as liquid does, and the slippage of gases along the pore walls gives rise to an apparent dependence of permeability on pressure. This is called the Klinkenberg effect, and it is especially important in low-permeable rocks.
In probe permeametry (mini-permeameter) measurement nitrogen gas is injected from the probe into core through a probe sealed to a core slab by a gasket. The gas flows from the end of a small-diameter tube that is sealed against the core surface. The pressure in the probe and the corresponding volumetric gas flow rate is measured together. The gas permeability is determined by the equation:
Where,
Obviously what can be obtained from minipermeameter measurement is gas permeability. Gas slippage will occur during the measurement because nitrogen is injected quickly from probe to core and it is very difficult to get to equilibrium in very short time span. Therefore, to get the permeability equivalent to the brine permeability at formation condition Klinkenberg calibration is necessary.

The Poisoned Chalice

"The Poisoned Chalice" is the pilot episode of the Showtime-Bravo! series The Borgias. It was written and directed by series creator Neil Jordan and originally aired on April 3, 2011, as the first half of a 2 hour premiere.
The episode deals with Rodrigo Borgia's election as Pope after the death of Pope Innocent VIII, and introduces the supporting cast of Borgia's family, and the College of Cardinals.
Plot.
Pope Innocent VIII (Michael Poole) calls the College of Cardinals into his bedchamber to hear his final words. Among them are Vice Chancellor Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (Jeremy Irons), Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (Colm Feore), and Cardinal Orsini (Derek Jacobi). Bishop Cesare Borgia (François Arnaud) arrives at the Vatican just before it closes for Papal conclave, where Rodrigo tells him of his intention to be elected Pope. He instructs Cesare to look for a dove in their home each night, carrying information for bribes to other Cardinals in exchange for their votes. Outside of the Vatican, Juan Borgia (David Oakes) battles with a Roman, and is saved by Cesare when he is blindsided by a second Roman. After the first unsuccessful vote, Rodrigo sends a dove to Cesare, instructing him to send titles and benefits from his various abbeys and monasteries to several Cardinals, hidden in their food. At the next vote, his total rises from 4 to 8, but is once again unsuccessful in gaining a majority.
Rodrigo sends another dove to Cesare, instructing him to send Juan to the Borgia churches and empty them of gold and precious stones to use as bribes. His vote total rises again to 10, but no Cardinal has a majority, so the vote is unsuccessful once again. Rodrigo meets with Cardinal Ascanio Sforza (Peter Sullivan) in private, and agrees that, should he be elected Pope, he will appoint Sforza as Vice Chancellor in exchange for Sforza's vote, and his supporters' votes. In the next vote, Rodrigo is elected Pope, with a majority 14 votes. Immediately following his election, he is accused of simony by Cardinals della Rovere and Orsini, but they are made silent after Rodrigo reminds them that he must select a Vice Chancellor, which includes a higher income. As both della Rovere and Orsini are considered front-runners for the position, they withdraw their accusations for the time.
After the College of Cardinals confirms that Rodrigo is male, Cesare confesses his sins to Rodrigo, including bribing several Cardinals in exchange for their support, of which he is absolved. Cesare pleads with his father to release him from his vows to the church and allow him to lead the papal armies, but he is denied in favour of Juan, who is made Gonfalonier of the Church. Later at his home, his mistress and the mother of his children Vannozza dei Cattanei (Joanne Whalley) is displeased when he denies her affections, as he must appear to be celibate. Following an elaborate parade, Rodrigo is crowned Pope, selecting the name Alexander VI.
Holding Consistory with the Cardinals, the Pope selects Cardinal Ascanio Sforza as his Vice Chancellor. Enraged, Cardinal Orsini once again accuses Borgia of simony, believing the position was promised to him. After Cardinal della Rovere openly approves of Cardinal Sforza's appointment and Borgia's papacy, he urges Orsini to do the same and save himself. He does, and invites the College of Cardinals and the Pope to a banquet at his palace.
Alexander brings Cesare with him to the banquet as his guest, but is confused as to why Cesare brings a monkey with him. During dinner, Cesare excuses himself to clean up after the monkey, and observes a servant quickly fleeing the dining room. Cesare follows him to the kitchens, where he observes the servant mixing something. After a short fight, Cesare hires the servant, who reveals himself as an assassin named Michelotto (Sean Harris), to serve Cardinal Orsini poisoned wine. When Cesare returns to dinner, Orsini proposes a toast, and after sitting down, begins to die. He attempts to accuse the Pope as his murderer, but dies before he can finish his accusation. The room erupts in chaos, and Cesare quickly escorts his father out of Orsini's palace and to safety.
Reception.
Ratings.
"The Poisoned Chalice" (along with the next episode, "The Assassin", which aired immediately following) was viewed by 1.06 million people during its initial airing, which set a series high that has yet to be surpassed.

Henry Denny Denson

Henry Denny Denson (ca 1715 – June 3, 1780) was an Irish-born soldier and political figure in Nova Scotia. He was a member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1761 to 1765 and from 1770 unil his death in 1780.
He was born in County Mayo. He married in Ireland but shortly afterwards joined the British Army as a lieutenant, leaving his wife behind in Dublin. By 1760, he had decided to settle in Nova Scotia and was serving as an agent for the Nova Scotia government in settling people from New England. He acquired a large property (in excess of 4000 acres) where he wished to recreate a baronial estate, which he named Mount Denson. The estate was a complex farm utilizing both dyked marshlands and pastures cleared from the wooded uplands. Here he raised beef and dairy cattle, grains, and apples which were to supply his cider press. A census taken in 1770 indicates "Mount Denson yielded 250 bushels of wheat, 10 bushels of fax seed and 40 bushels of oats; lifestock consisted of 150 sheep, 96 cattle, 12 swine, and 8 horses". To run the estate Denson utilized tenant farmers, indentured servants and slaves. 
In 1761, he was named justice in the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. Denson was also an officer in the militia, commissioner for roads and customs collector for the county. Denson often clashed with his neighbours, the New England Planters. To them he represented the British authority that had broken its promise to allow the new settlers to retain their form of township governance which they had enjoyed in New England. The British administration in Halifax enforced a centralized government regime which meant a loss of power and self determinaton to the Planters. 
By the late 1770s in declining health and suffering from extreme bouts of gout, he resigned from the militia and shortly afterwards died at Mount Denson, Falmouth.

Søren Georg Abel

Søren Georg Abel (3 January 1772 – 5 May 1820) was a Norwegian priest and politician, also known as the father of mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.
Personal life.
He was born in Mo, Telemark as the son of Hans Mathias Abel (1738–1803) and Elisabeth Knuth Normann (1737–1817).
In 1800 he married Anne Marie Simonsen. Their second oldest son was Niels Henrik Abel, the world-famous mathematician. Søren Georg Abel was also a great-grandfather of the politician Hans Prydz (1868–1957).
Career.
Søren Georg Abel enrolled as a student of Lutheran theology in 1788 and graduated as cand.theol. in 1792. In 1794 he was hired as chaplain under his father, who was vicar in "Gierestad og Wegaardsheien" parish. As Abel maintained ties with Peder Hansen, bishop of Agder, Hansen suggested that Abel be appointed vicar in Bygland in 1798. This never materialized, but Abel was appointed vicar in Findøe the next year. Regarding this position as a stepping stone, in 1801 Abel unsuccessfully applied for the vicarships in Sigdal, Holle and Aas. He remained in Findøe, and Niels Henrik Abel was born there in 1802.
In 1803 his father, the vicar, died. Abel applied for the vacant vicarship in Gierestad. Following a testimonial from Bishop Hansen and County Governor Koren, he was appointed. He later applied for ten other vicarships, but was not appointed and remained in Gierestad. In 1806 he published "Religions-spørgsmaal med Svar, indrettede efter de unges Fatte-evne", a well-known explanation of Luther's Small Catechism.
In 1814 he was elected to the first session of the Norwegian Parliament, representing the rural constituency Nedenæs Amt (today named Aust-Agder). He was not re-elected in 1815, but returned in 1818 to serve a final term.
He died in 1820.

John Reid McGowan

John Reid "Gentleman Jack" McGowan (1872 – 18 July 1912) was an Australian boxing champion. During his long career in the ring he fought over 110 battles, and was the first fighter to win three Australian titles at different weights, holding the titles of bantam, feather, and light-weight champion of Australia.
Family.
McGowan was a first generation Australian and resident of South Melbourne. He was one of six children born to Scottish immigrants William Daniel McGowan and Jane McGowan (née Reid).
In 1891 he was married to Mary Josephine Clancy. They had a son and a daughter before Mary died in 1896. In 1902 he married Elizabeth Mary Ellen Dykes and they had one son and three daughters.
Boxing career.
McGowan first entered the ring in October 1889, when at Albury he drew with Mick Colles in a 15 rounds match. McGowan won the bantam championship in 1891 be beating George Griffiths. In 1893 was beaten by Nipper Peakes for the feather-weight championship. On the retirement of Peakes, McGowan fought Harry Perry for the championship, and won in 14 rounds.
In 1894 began the sequence of four memorable fights between McGowan and Tim Hegarty for the championship. They met four times. In the first three battles (each 20 rounds) Hegarty won on points. The fourth, of 20 rounds, resulted in a draw, it having been agreed that if both were on their feet to draw the stakes. 
In 1896 Jack Marshall took McGowan to South Africa. There he beat Holloway for the light-weight championship of the country in four rounds, and Jimmy Murphy in 15 rounds.
In 1899 McGowan beat George Atkinson in three battles of 15, 20 and 51 rounds. He later encountered a boxer named Tom Mitchell at the Melbourne Democratic Club. Mitchell weighed over to McGowan's , McGowan stayed the limit but the verdict went against him. 
In 1904 McGowan fought Tasmanian lightweight champion Billy Maher in Ballarat. McGowan broke his arm in the 8th round but fought on till police intervened and stopped the fight in round 11. The referee declared the fight a draw.
McGowan was out of commission for a number of years, having turned his attention entirely to instruction of pupils at the Melbourne Athletic Club and University of Melbourne Athletic Club. He came back after a few years and fought Bob Greenshields in 1909 to win the lightweight championship of Australia.
McGowan was at one stage a boxing pupil of "The Black Diamond" Jack Dowridge, a Barbadian immigrant who pioneered boxing in Brisbane, Australia. Among Dowridge's other pupils was "The Black Prince" Peter Jackson (boxer). 
McGowan was inducted into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame (ANBHOF) in 2008.
Bland Holt Dramatic Company.
Another source of income for McGowan when not boxing was appearing and touring with the Bland Holt Dramatic Company. He would take part in novelty sporting exhibitions which were written into the plays. In "Sporting Life" he gave demonstrations of scientific boxing with another lightweight, played on at least one occasion by his brother Archibald McGowan, an amateur lightweight champion himself.Wanganui Chronicle review, 7 February 1900
Australian Rules Football.
When boxing commitments allowed, McGowan played Australian rules football with VFA club South Melbourne (Now known as the Sydney Swans) during the club's successful late 1880s to mid 1890s period, including at least one Premiership team in 1890. South Melbourne Team Saturday 27 September 1890 vs Richmond
Death.
McGowan died from a cerebral haemorrhage in the Melbourne Hospital after collapsing while sparring with a pupil at the Melbourne Athletic Club.
Two weeks earlier he had sustained slight concussion of the brain by colliding with one of his pupils and had been advised to rest.
He is buried at Melbourne General Cemetery. 
McGowan Street, Southbank, Victoria (Formerly South Melbourne) is named in his honour.

Richard Paul Wagner

Richard Felix Paul Wagner (25 August 1882 - 14 February 1953) was the Chief of Design in the design office of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in Germany from its inception in 1922 to 1942. He held the rank of "Reichsbahnoberrat". Richard Wagner was born in Berlin on 25 August 1882 and studied at the Charlottenburg Technical High School there from 1901 to 1906.
Career.
In 1920 he took over as head of the Berlin-Grunewald Locomotive Testing Office. In 1922 he was on the Enger Committee for the Standardisation of Locomotives and was employed by the Reichsbahn Central Office. In 1923 he took over the locomotive section within the Central Office.
Standard locomotives.
With the development of standard steam locomotives (the so-called "Einheitsdampflokomotiven") for the Deutsche Reichsbahn he was able to carry through his proposals for rationalising the construction and operation of steam locomotives. These were: to have the fewest possible locomotive classes, to avoid sub-classes and special classes, to have as many interchangeable parts as possible between different classes, even after undergoing repairs, and to produce components to a high degree of precision. As a result, in his time, a programme of locomotive classes was set up in the Standardisation Office of the Reichsbahn and with the manufacturers. On 1 June 1942 he retired, his successor being Friedrich Witte.
Wagner was influenced by his experiences with railway regiments in the First World War (locomotives frequently being out of service, problems with the procurement of spare parts, the maintenance of a large number of different classes of state railway ("Länderbahn") locomotives, the lack of standardisation of components, and the need for simple and maintenance-friendly designs) and that led him to press for, sometimes very successful, but also at times rather stifling ideas about the concept of the "Einheitslokomotiven". For example, Wagner was vehemently against fuel-saving high-performance boilers and four-cylinder compound engines, that had been very successful in the German state railways (e.g. the Bavarian S 3/6) or in other countries (e.g. the French designs of Chapelon), albeit more costly to maintain.
The programme of locomotive classes for the standard steam engines that Wagner helped to create could initially only be instigated on a small scale by the Reichsbahn, both for economic reasons and due to delays in upgrading railway routes to take the higher axle load of 20 tonnes. In many cases, just one or two trial locomotives of a given class were built or only small or pre-production runs delivered. Not until the onset of the German Reich's preparations for war were the 2-10-0 goods train locomotives from the standardisation programme, and the wartime locomotive ("Kriegslokomotiven") derived from it, built in large quantities.
Other innovations.
Today the name Wagner is particularly well known in railway circles for the standard smoke deflectors on Reichsbahn steam locomotives which bear his name; but this locomotive feature represents only a small part of his overall influence.
Honours.
In 1931 he was given an honorary doctorate by the Technical University of Aachen for his services in the structural development of the steam and oil engines and in 1936, the gold medal of service from the Society of British Locomotive Engineers. In 1942 he was awarded the War Merit Cross.
Death.
He died on 14 February 1953 at Velburg in the Upper Palatinate region of Bavaria, Germany.

Garnet Campbell

Garnet Campbell (born 31 July 1903, date of death unknown) was an Australian rules footballer who played for and coached Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Campbell, noted for his strong disposal skills and pace, was best suited as either a centreman or winger. Essendon won Grand Finals in his first two seasons but he was not a member of their premiership sides, finding it hard to break into the team initially. He was a regular from 1925 onwards and in the 1926 Brownlow Medal count finished as Essendon's highest vote getter and equal fifth overall. Campbell, who represented Victoria at the 1927 Melbourne Carnival, was appointed captain-coach of Essendon in 1931 but his stint and VFL career ended in 1933 when they finished with the wooden spoon. He finished his career as Sandringham's captain-coach.

Minipermeameter

In petroleum engineering, a minipermeameter is a gas-based device for measuring permeability in porous rocks.
Minipermeametry has been used in the oil industry since the late 1960s (Eijpe and Weber, 1971) without becoming in any way a standard experimental method in core analysis or reservoir characterisation. The laboratory minipermeametry can make important contributions both as an improved methodology within experimental petrophysics and as a source of data invaluable in routine reservoir characterisation (C. HALVORSEN AND A. HURST, 1990)
The values obtained from the minipermeameter should possibly be calibrated by a Klinkenberg correction

Head mirror

A head mirror is a simple diagnostic device, stereotypically worn by physicians, but less so in recent decades as they have become somewhat obsolete.
A head mirror is mostly used for examination of the ear, nose & throat. It comprises a circular concave mirror, with a small hole in the middle, and is attached to a head band. The mirror is worn over the physician's eye of choice, with the concave mirror surface facing outwards and the hole directly over the physician's eye, providing illumination like a ring light.
In use, the patient sits and faces the physician. A bright lamp is positioned adjacent to the patient's head, pointing toward the physician's face and hence towards the head mirror. The light from the lamp reflects off the mirror, along the line of sight of the user, with the light being somewhat concentrated by the curvature of the mirror. When used properly, the head mirror thus provides excellent shadow-free illumination.
Because they were once in common use, notably by general practitioners and otorhinolaryngologists, head mirrors are often a stereotypical part of a physician's uniform by costumers and prop men e.g. in comic routines. The main drawback to head mirrors was that they require some skill to use well. They are rarely seen outside of the ENT setting, having been largely replaced by pen lights among general practitioners. They are still routinely used by otolaryngologists, particularly for examination and procedures involving the oral cavity.

Benoni Danks

Benoni Danks (ca 1716 – 1776) was a New England Ranger and political figure in Nova Scotia, and representative of Cumberland County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1765 to 1770. He is best known as the commander of Danks' Rangers.
Benoni Danks was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, the son of Robert Danks and Rebecca Rust. In 1745, he married Mary Morris. He first commanded a ranger company during the Seven Years' War (1756-1762). His company operated in the Chignecto area during the Petitcodiac River Campaign and later the St. John River Campaign, both part of the Expulsion of the Acadians. He was active against the French and their native allies—for the most part the Mi'kmaq. In 1756 his company, men raised mainly in New England, was expanded and became an independent ranger unit in the British Army—often referred to as Danks' Rangers. The company was active between 1756 and 1762 (when it was disbanded). It averaged about 100 men. The unit was based out of Fort Cumberland on the Isthmus of Chignecto, and frequently skirmished with Mi'kmaq Indians and Acadian rebels during a prolonged insurgency against British rule in the area (lasting from 1755 to 1760). It is alleged that his unit turned in the scalps of Acadians for bounties, claiming that they were from natives. The rangers carried out raids against French settlers on the Petitcodiac River and also participated in the siege of Quebec. The unit suffered heavy casualties in the skirmishing around the edges of the siege, and for a time, after Danks was seriously wounded, were incorporated into the ranger company of Captain Moses Hazen. In 1761, he was granted land in Cumberland County. His company often operated in tandem with Gorham's Rangers, based out of Halifax, and after 1761, the two companies were combined into a Nova Scotia ranging corps, led by Major Joseph Gorham. As part of this corps, Danks and his company took part in the Siege of Havana in 1762, where, according to Israel Putnam, he sold his commission in the rangers.Two years later, Danks was named a justice of the peace and militia commander for Cumberland County. In 1767, he was named collector of duties on alcohol, tea, coffee and playing cards.
Sympathetic to the American Revolution, Danks was captured after taking part in a rebellion - the Battle of Fort Cumberland - led by Jonathan Eddy and died at Windsor, Nova Scotia from an infected wound.
He is probably the namesake of Danks Point in Baie Verte, New Brunswick.

National Navy of Uruguay

The National Navy of Uruguay ("Armada Nacional del Uruguay") is a branch of the Armed Forces of Uruguay under the direction of the Ministry of National Defense and the commander in chief of the Navy ("Comandante en Jefe de la Armada" or COMAR) Admiral Juan H. Fernández.
The service is divided into four main sections: 
The Fleet Command is in charge of most of the actual ships of the fleet, the marines, and the naval aviation bases and aircraft. The Coast Guard administers the modest Uruguayan merchant marine and naval registry. The Naval Materiel Directorate preserves and repairs naval equipment, in addition to administering the fleet arsenal and directing hydrological and meteorological study. The Personnel Directorate is concerned with human resources and particularly the administration of the Uruguayan Naval Academy.
In addition, the Fleet General Staff ("Estado Mayor General de la Armada " or ESMAY) assists the admiral in his administration. It oversees naval intelligence, strategic and tactical planning, logistics, liaison, and political lobbying on the Navy's behalf.
History.
Independence.
Under the late Spanish Empire, Montevideo became the main naval base ("Real Apostadero de Marina") for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands. The arrival of 100 ships under Viceroy Pedro de Cevallos in 1777 was the beginning of the city's prosperity.
The Uruguayan navy, however, dates its origin from General Artigas's letter of marque on 15 November 1817, which authorized his forces to plunder Buenosairean shipping wherever they found it. Under the nominal leadership of the Pedro Campbell, the Irish "Gaucho Admiral", around 50 privateer schooners and brigs (including the "República Oriental", the "Fortuna", the "Valiente", the "Temerario", and the "Intrépido") were able to capture more than 200 enemy vessels as far off as Madagascar, Spain, and the Antilles.
Early Republic.
Following independence, a navy was established under Colonel Pablo Zufriategui, a veteran of Artigas's campaigns and the 33 Esterners. As Captain of Ports ("Capitán General de Puertos"), he fought smuggling and in 1832 directed the first sovereign engagement as the schooner "Aguila" chased off the pirate ship "Exquisit" from Uruguayan waters.
Although the force remained too small to play a decisive role in the Great War, it is notable that command of the small fleet was personally assumed by "Jose" Garibaldi, who captured Colonia del Sacramento, Isla Martín García, and Gualeguaychú. The flagship during this period was the corvette "Sarandí", named after an important battle in the war for independence.
The first specially fitted warships were the gunboats "General Rivera", "General Artigas", and "General Suárez". The first was assembled in Uruguay by the Academy of Arts & Crafts ("Escuela de Artes y Oficios") and commissioned in April 1884; the second was constructed in Trieste, then part of Austria-Hungary, and commissioned in December 1884; the last was the 23-year-old French gunboat "Tactique", acquired in 1886. The "General Rivera" was the first ship of the Navy to pass the Strait of Magellan.
Modern Era.
Just prior to World War One, President Williman devoted considerable effort and expense to modernizing the navy, viewing it as demanded for Uruguay's "sovereignty and honor." After false starts in 1817, 1863, and 1874, the Naval Academy ("Escuela Naval") was finally permanently established in December 1907. New ships included the gunboat "Dieciocho de Julio" (constructed in the UK in 1889), the cruiser "Montevideo" (also British, 1887), the transport "Maldonado" (constructed in Germany in 1886 and soon rebaptized as the "Barón de Río Branco" for its tasks for the Commission on the Limits of the Merín Lagoon), the steamer "Vanguardia", and the courier "Oriental". The cruiser "Uruguay" was constructed to order in Germany and commissioned August 1910. Also in 1910, the government acquired the Cibils-Jackson shipyard, renaming it the National Dock. These advances were then sabotaged by funding cutbacks throughout the 1920s that left the navy poorly maintained.
In June 1916, the tug "Instituto de Pesca Nº1" - manned by servicemen - was the second failed attempt to rescue the men of Shackleton's expedition from Elephant Island.
In 1925, the Fleet Aeronautics Service ("Servicio de Aeronáutica de la Armada") was created under Captain Atilio Frigerio, the first Uruguayan pilot to obtain the brevet of Military Pilot (Aviano, Italy, 1912). The first planes, however, did not arrive until 1930.
In 1934, the first Naval Act ("Ley Orgánica de la Armada") created the Inspectorate of the Navy ("Inspección General de Marina"), freeing the Navy from direct subordination to the Army. The next year, three patrol boats ordered from Cantieri Navali Riuniti in Genoa arrived. The "Paysandú", "Salto", and "Río Negro" served for about thirty years, were decommissioned, and then were brought back into service in the 90s.
World War II.
In December 1939, the Río de la Plata saw the first major naval engagement of World War II when the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" faced the cruisers HMS "Ajax", "Achilles", and "Exeter" and then fled into Montevideo harbor during the Battle of the River Plate. Although Uruguay was officially neutral, her pro-British sentiment allowed the Royal Navy to carry out a highly successful disinformation campaign that ended in the German scuttling of the ship.
In 1940, La Paloma's Naval Base ("Base Naval de la Paloma") was established. The same year, Uruguay introduced conscription and the Navy established the battalions "Zapicán" and "Honor y Patria" as part of its Reserve Fleet. The next year, the Navy created the Naval War School ("Escuela de Guerra Naval") to improve its officers' training.
Although Uruguay did not officially join the Allies until 15 February 1945, it was involved in assisting the convoy effort. This involved the confiscation of two Italian and two Occupied Danish freighters in Montevideo, which were manned by the Navy and rechristened the "Montevideo", the "Maldonado", the "Rocha", and the "Colonia". The "Montevideo" was sunk by an Italian sub in March 1942, which prompted Uruguay to seize the German freighter "Tacoma". In August 1942, the "Maldonado" was sunk after its commander was taken prisoner by an attacking German U-Boat. Following this, Uruguay leased a number of its boats to the US Navy and received in 1944 the ASW-capable corvette "Maldonado".
The Fleet Aeronautics Service received six Kingfisher hydroplanes from the United States of America in 1942 and Laguna del Sauce Aeronaval Base (Base Aeronaval No.2 de Laguna del Sauce) in 1947.
Cold War.
Following World War II, the beginning of the Cold War saw the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance signed in Rio de Janeiro, which provided for "Hemispheric defense" and required signatory states to work to improve and coordinate their naval forces. Between 1949 and 1952, the FAS received sixteen TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, three SNJ Texan trainers, and twelve F6F Hellcat fighters. More, in 1952, the surface fleet received the destroyer escorts "Uruguay" (DE-1) and "Artigas" (DE-2) and, in 1953, the frigate "Montevideo".
In 1955, the Coast Guard received the three launches PS-1, PS-2, and PS-3. In May 1959, the PS-2 stood out in the rescue of the crew of the "Pietrina" off the English coast.
In 1957, the UNITAS joint exercises began between the United States and the navies of Latin America. The basic training was oriented towards protection of marine lines of trade and communication, focusing on escort and ASW exercises. With the aim of improving the navy's range and support capability, the oiler "Presidente Oribe" was purchased in 1962; ten years later, the second oiler "Presidente Rivera"; and in 1978, the "Juan Antonio Lavalleja".
From 1960 to 1962, naval officers on the "Alférez Cámpora" circumnavigated the globe.
In 1965, three S2A Tracker ASW planes were received; in 1966, the minesweepers "Cte. Pedro Campbell" and "Montevideo"; in 1969, the tender "Hurrican"; in 1970, the minesweepers "Rio Negro" and "Maldonado". In 1973, the destroyer "18 de Julio" replaced the "Montevideo".
The present Uruguayan Marine Corps ("Cuerpo de Fusileros Navales") was established in 1972.
In 1978, repairs were completed to the ROU 20 "Capitan Miranda" that converted it into a training ship and sailing school. Following graduation from the Naval Academy, cadets embark on a cruise of the world that functions as a good-will tour for Uruguay.
Current.
In 1981, three French-designed "Vigilante" class patrol boats arrive for the Coast Guard – the "15 de Noviembre", "25 de Agosto", and "Comodoro Coe" – but it is discovered that their upkeep is considerably more expensive than promised, and the ships are quite unsuited for conditions in the Rio de la Plata. An attempt to sell them in 1995 found no buyers, however, and so the ships have remained in active service.
In 1988, the Navy acquired a new ship to replace its previous oilers, christened the "Presidente Rivera".
From 1989 to 1991, three "Commandant Riviere" class frigates are purchased from France. These are christened the ROU 02 "General Artigas", the ROU 01 "Uruguay", and the ROU 03 "Montevideo". These too run into problems, particularly with upkeep, and the "General Artigas" is removed from service. In a decision between the two ships, the "Uruguay" is decommissioned and the "Montevideo" receives repairs and refurbishment.
Following the fall of Communism, a number of former East German Volksmarine ships are purchased from the new government. In 1991, the Navy receives the minesweepers ROU 31 "Temerario", ROU 32 "Valiente", ROU 33 "Fortuna", and ROU 34 "Audaz". These are named for corsairs of the independence era. On 5 August 2000, the "Valiente" sank after a collision. Also in 1991, the "Otto von Guericke" is purchased and converted into the ROU 26 "Vanguardia".
The Coast Guard received new ships from the United States of America, the "Colonia" and "Río Negro"; and in 1999, nine boats of the 44 class from the same country.
The buoy tender "Sirius" was constructed in Montevideo at the National Dock, which also refitted the Portuguese "Cte. Pedro Campbell" and "Uruguay".
At the end of 1998, the research ship "Oyarvide" was purchased from Germany for the purpose of studying and charting the Continental Shelf. It is hoped that the work will justify a redefinition of its boundaries that would approximately double Uruguay's marine exclusive economic zone to around 200,000 km².
Organization.
The National Navy is composed of about 5,700 personnel organized principally into four commands, each with its distinctive color for official functions.
In addition, there are two General Services Corps ("Servicios Generales" or SS.GG.)
and the Naval Academy ("Escuela Naval" or ESNAL).
The National Navy also includes the Uruguayan Marine Corps and the National Naval Aviation Command.
Fleet.
The ship prefix for Uruguay is ROU (for "República Oriental del Uruguay," the "Oriental Republic of Uruguay"). In addition to their ship name, government ships are numerically listed. This is a position and not an identification number: as ships are decommissioned and replaced, their previous numbers are reused by newer vessels.
The current fleet consists of:
Since 1997, the Uruguayan Naval Academy has also maintained the racing sloop "Bonanza", a gift from the US Naval Academy at Annapolis.
Uruguayan Naval Aviation.
Uruguayan Naval Aviation ("Aviación Naval Uruguaya" or ANU) is the sub-branch of the National Navy for naval aircraft and aviation training. Naval aircraft use a new wing emblem instead of the traditional Artigas roundel like the Uruguayan Air Force for easier identification and use the Uruguayan National flag as fin flash.
It was created as Aeronautic Service of the Fleet ("Servicio de Aeronáutica de la Armada") on 7 February 1925, but didn't receive its first aircraft (two CANT 18 and one CANT 21) until 24 September 1930.
In 12 June 1934, the Naval Air Base (1) "Isla Libertad" in Montevideo's Bay was declared operational.
In 1942, Grumman J4F Widgeon, Sikorsky OS2U-3 Kingfisher & Fairchild PT-23A trainers were received from the US for base access.
The Naval Air Base (2) Corvette Captain Carlos A. Curbelo at Laguna del Sauce was declared operational in 10 September 1947.
During the years 1949 to 1957, a large supply of North American SNJ-4, Grumman Avenger, Grumman Hellcat, Martin Mariner aircraft were delivered.
The force was renamed Naval Aviation (Aviación Naval) in 1951, and as Uruguayan Naval Aviation (Aviación Naval Uruguaya) in 1955.
During the middle of the 60´s, most of the planes in the inventory reached the end of their life. In this decade Beechcraft T-34 A/B, Beechcraft C-45, Grumman S-2A Tracker, Bell TH-13 and Sikorsky CH-34J were incorporated. In 1979 nine North American T-28D Fennec and one C-45 were donated by the Argentinian Navy. Fennecs were used as a light attack platform until 2000. By 1980 one Bell 222 Airwolf was bought for SAR operations. In 1982 three Turbo Mentor and three Grumman S-2G Tracker were acquired. Trackers operated until 2001. Since then they are on reserve. Some more T-34 Mentor were exchanged from the Uruguayan Air Force.
By 1999 last airworthy Fennecs, three Cessna 182 and two Piper Seneca were sold. In the same year were incorporated two Handley Page Jetstream TMk 2 from the Royal Navy for training and maritime patrol duties, with the local addition of two APS-128 radar noses. They operated until 2007. 
6 MBB Bo-105M were received from Germany in 2006, plus one Helibras Esquilo donated by the Brazilian government. Since 2011 Uruguayan Navy is interested in the acquisition of six Lockheed S-3 Viking used from USN stocks. In 2013 was incorporated another Beechcraft Super King Air. In the near future there are some plans to incorporate a number of Beechcraft B 350ER or CASA 212MP, between four to six T-34C-1 Turbo Mentors and some helicopters for carried based operations, like AW A 109 ASW and some used Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King as a replacement of the declining Wessex fleet.
Small command w/Squadron Group (Grupo de Escuadrones) of 2 squadrons and 1 training school.

San Lucas Island

San Lucas Island (Spanish: "Isla San Lucas") is an island located off the Pacific shore of Costa Rica in the Gulf of Nicoya. 
It is part of the 11th district of Puntarenas Canton of the province of Puntarenas.
Formerly serving as an island prison, it is now a National Park.
Geography.
San Lucas Island located in the Gulf of Nicoya off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, about 40 minutes in boat from Puntarenas. The island has an area of approximately 4.6 km².
Indigenous culture.
Indigenous groups lived on San Lucas and the surrounding islands. There are eight known archeological sites on the island, including apparent houses where stone tools and a metal object were found in the late 1970s. The excavation sites date to between 1,000 and 1,500 AD.
Prison.
From 1873 to 1991, San Lucas Island was a penal island for some of the worst criminals in Costa Rica. It is often erroneously cited as the largest prison in Costa Rican history. It was founded by the dictator Tomás Miguel Guardia Gutiérrez. Being sent to San Lucas Island was a terrible prospect as prisoners lives were short and often spent in torture. Ironically, Guardia abolished the death penalty a year after establishing the prison.
The former buildings of the penal island are considered "Patrimonio de Cultura," or cultural heritage sites. The buildings include a historic dock that is still in use after the first dock was destroyed, a church, a medical building, temporary holding cells, a three story main office, a large concrete disc used to hold a water tank, and water pumps. In addition, there are prison cells of varying security levels depending on the prisoners' crimes. The prison cells contain the typical graffiti of older Latin American prisons, such as religious phrases, pornographic images, signatures, and drawings. There are also several water pumps and a cemetery under excavation on the island.
José León Sánchez, a prisoner of the island, wrote "La Isla de Hombres Solos," translated into English as "The Island of Lonely Men," based on his time in the prison at San Lucas Island. León claimed that he was unjustly imprisoned for a robbery that he did not commit. Other prisoners included Beltrán Cortés Carvajal, the famous killer of the doctors Carlos Manuel Echandi Lahmann and Ricardo Moreno Cañas.
These people spend in torture maybe all their life`s. In the prison where the water and food was gone a little girl of about 6 or 10 was left there where she died of hunger, and her spirit is said to still remain there. In Ghost Hunters International, they catch her saying "Aqua"(water) which means that there are some spirits left behind in that prison.
Wildlife.
In 2008, Costa Rica declared the island part of the national wildlife preserve, a ceremony which featured a speech by former prisoner León. 
The island includes a wide variety of wildlife, such as howler monkeys, spiders, snakes, deer, and pheasants. There are also at least 8 species of bats on the island. The waters surrounding the island are home to hammerhead sharks, rays, and turtles.
Tourism.
The Instituto Costarricense de Turismo began planning to invest money into tourism on the island by developing commercial spaces for restaurants, beaches, and tour operators. The volunteer organization Raleigh International occasionally sends young volunteers to help rangers clear beaches to make the island more attractive for tourism.
Now it is a full-fledged tourist destination, with several companies offering charters to the island. There is great concern that the tourist activities are destroying pre-Columbian sites and the prison's archeological significance, as well as the wildlife habitats of the area. 
Volunteer work.
The Island benefits from the charity Raleigh International, who work with the rangers on the Island to improve the surrounding area.
Over the years the island has been visited from many volunteering groups with the aim to improve access and protect the island.

Blanche Heriot

Blanche Heriot was a legendary heroine from Chertsey, Surrey, whose story was brought to a wider public in two works by the Chertsey-born early Victorian writer Albert Smith.
Background.
In 1842 Smith's first play, "Blanche Heriot, or The Chertsey Curfew", was produced at the Surrey Theatre. "As a native of Chertsey," wrote Henry Turner in Clement Scott's magazine "The Theatre", "he was naturally acquainted with the local legend of the heroic girl who, in order to gain time for her lover's pardon to arrive, and so save his head from 'rolling on the Abbey mead,' clung to the clapper of the enormous bell in the belfry tower, and thereby attained her object." The Irish actress Maria Honner "was the heroine and her portrait (life-size) was on every hoarding in London, swinging to and fro with her hair streaming in the wind." 
In 1843 Smith published "The Wassail-Bowl: A Comic Christmas Sketchbook", Volume II of which included a short story, "Blanche Heriot: A Legend of Old Chertsey Church", on the same subject as his play of the previous year. A summary of "Blanche Heriot: A Legend of Old Chertsey Church" follows.
Synopsis.
Blanche Heriot is a young woman, living in Chertsey during the 'Wars of the Roses' (Cousins' Wars). The story is set in May 1471 when Edward IV of England, the first and longest-serving Yorkist King, has just won back the throne from his cousin.
Blanche has a lover, Neville Audley, who has been away in the wars, fighting for the Lancastrians. He returns to Chertsey with a price on his head and is intent on fleeing to the Continent. However, he is apprehended by Yorkist soldiers in Chertsey. He kills one soldier and a dog and flees to Chertsey Abbey, seeking sanctuary.
Neville, however, is arrested and sentenced to die at curfew the next day. A mutual friend of Blanche and Neville, Herrick Evenden, agrees to take a token (a ring given to Neville by a nobleman from the Yorkist side for Neville sparing his life) to London to call in that favour by in turn sparing Neville's life. With only five minutes to go before curfew bell will toll, Herrick is seen by townsfolk approaching Laleham ferry, half a mile away, on his return from London. Realising that Neville's life depends on her delaying the curfew, Blanche runs to the bell tower and ascends the old stairs. She crouches down beneath the bell and clings onto the clapper. Despite being dashed against the bell and frame, she holds on until the sexton (accompanied by soldiers) decides to climb the tower to investigate. Just then, Herrick Evenden arrives with a pardon for Neville. Following his release, a party ensues at the local hostelry, and Neville and Blanche are married shortly afterwards.
Albert Smith completes the story with a reference to the motto inscribed around the band of the Curfew Bell, ""Ora mente pia pro nobis, Virgo Maria"". This was the fifth bell in the ring of eight at the medieval parish church, St. Peter's, Chertsey. It was cast circa 1310 and re-cast circa 1380 for Chertsey Abbey by the Wokingham founders who were linked to the Abbey. On the dissolution of Chertsey Abbey in July 1537, it was moved from the abbey church just behind the other medieval church, which was left for plunder of its stone.
Related matters.
A bronze statue of Blanche Heriot by Sheila Mitchell F.R.B.S stands in Chertsey.
Lydia Sigourney wrote an article, "Love and Loyalty", which appeared posthumously in "Peterson's Magazine" in September 1865. This is highly likely to be based on the Blanche Heriot story. It was then picked up and formed the basis of the narrative poem "Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight" by Rose Hartwick Thorpe in 1867.
The main specialist GUM clinic of St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey is the Blanche Heriot Unit in honour of this important just and romantic figure in the history of the country, if the accounts are true.

Marat Gelman

Marat Alexandrovich Gelman (; born December 24, 1960 in Kishinev, Moldavian SSR, Soviet Union) is an owner and director of Guelman's Contemporary Art Gallery, ex-owner of the Foundation for Effective Politics, and the former assistant director of Channel One (Russia). Gelman was at the forefront of a movement to pioneer Moscow's first contemporary galleries in the 1990s, setting up his Gelman gallery alongside the Aidan and XL galleries to cater to the rich and famous.
Early years.
He was born in the capital of Moldova, then a Soviet republic. His father was famous Soviet playwright and screenwriter Alexander Guelman. He claimed that he was studying in school #37 but abandoned it due to youth problems
In 1983 he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Communication. While he was in high school he worked at the Moscow Art Theatre during the evenings. He then avoided the military draft because this institute had a military chair.
Career in Chişinău.
Between 1983 and 1985 he worked as the head of non-standard equipment at the Chişinău television factory "Alpha". In 1985 he worked as an engineer at the Chişinău Scientific Research Institute of Non-destructive Diagnostics.
Between 1985 and 1990 he was the general director of a "science and technical youth center" (kind of commercial companies during late Soviet time) in Chişinău.
Life and work in Moscow.
1990-2000.
In 1990 he moved from Moldova to Moscow, and established the "Guelman Gallery." This gallery hosted exhibitions of Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol, as well as many political performances.
He began working with so-called "political technologies" (political public relations campaigns) in cooperation with the image-making company of Yefim Ostrovsky in 2001. During the 1995 Russian Parliament elections, he was listed as a candidate in Komsomol's block "Threshold Generation" (Поколение рубежа). Together with Gleb Pavlovsky, he created the Foundation of Efficient Politics.
In 1997, he was going to start gathering voters to sign petitions for a Moscow referendum to remove the monument of Peter the Great by Tsereteli, but then stopped this due to terrorist acts (from presumably existed Komsomol's group "Revolutionary military council of RSFSR").
During the 1999 Russian Parliament elections, he was the head of election staff for the Union of Rightist Forces. During the elections of the Mayor of Moscow he worked for Sergei Kiriyenko.
Post 2000.
In April 2002, Guelman left the "Foundation of Efficient Politics", explaining that "FEP practically became a department of media services of President Administration". Between June 2002 and February 2004, he worked as the assistant of the General Director of Channel One, head of analytics. His resignation letter explained that this job was too simple for his analytical skills. From March to October 2003, he worked in the election staff of Sergey Glazyev and Dmitry Rogozin coalition Rodina (its name was changing, first it was "Comrade" and "Comrades"). (Later these clients were included in his own "list of fascists and xenophobs"). He participated in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections as an adviser to Viktor Yanukovych (whose coalition Party of Regions most likely has no connections with same-name Polish and Russian parties). Between the summer of 2005 and the autumn of 2006, he was a prominent member of the newly created Social Democratic Party of Russia.
Internet projects.
Marat Guelman is also known as a curator of many internet-projects, both art- and politics-related:

Sophie Bruce of BBC Music raved that "duo's talent is undoubtable and this album sounds like an instant classic", noting that "is the sound of the Noughties—electro enough without being harsh, interesting without being over-cool, quirky without being weird." Andrew Leahey of Allmusic called the album "eclectic" and wrote that the duo "find common ground between their stylistically disparate backgrounds, producing a number of songs filled with Steele's quirky pop melodies and Littlemore's hip dance sensibilities." "Blender"s Tyler Gray stated that "[acoustic guitar strummed in time with dance beats, tinny vocals and tons of slap-back reverb—it's like some magical pop formula concocted long ago by aboriginal Australian shamen and parceled out ever since to INXS, Midnight Oil, Outback Steakhouse jingle makers and now this turquoise-loving duo." Martin Robinson of the "NME" heavily compared Empire of the Sun to MGMT, stating that "ludicrousness of 'We Are The People' and 'Walking On A Dream' doesn't stop them from being sensational. Both have sunshiny choruses which hook into your perineum and drag you upwards, with 'Walking On A Dream's mantra of 'We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it' marking it as their 'Time To Pretend'." Michael Cragg of musicOMH, however, felt that the album "offers little in the way of musical experimentation" and that "[most of it sounds like a strange amalgam of Fleetwood Mac and MGMT, as if the latter had been transposed from the slightly grubby streets of Brooklyn to the beaches of Australia."
Christian Hoard of "Rolling Stone" wrote that the duo "have lots of straightforward pop chops, but they prefer to get wonky with cheesetastic, Eighties-flavored keyboards and nonsense rhymes like 'Hotdog belt donut melt/Magpie knelt by itself'", adding that the album "sounds like Europop on Special K." In a review for "The Guardian", Dorian Lynskey commented, "At various points, "Walking On a Dream" resembles Prince, Mercury Rev, Angelo Badalamenti, Funkadelic and the Muppets, none of them at their best." Andy Gill of "The Independent" opined that the songs "Walking on a Dream" and "We Are the People" "rather resemble The Beloved or Air, sharing with those duos the impression that the music just seems to have settled, like snow, around the melody." "The Observer" critic Alex Denney opined that "the record settles upon a cooler hue, favouring minor-key shuffles that, at their best, sound like prime Bangles cuts, but tend towards pedestrian 1980s pop hackery at their worst." Tyler Fisher of PopMatters referred to the music as a "mix of swirling analog synth, funky guitar, and basic drum beats all placed in a world of reverb that sounds like an ethereal, distant realm of sound." Jason Treuen of "Rolling Stone Australia" described the album as "gorgeously plaintive electro-pop", commenting that "there's no denying Littlemore and Steele have touched on something beautiful and otherworldly here", but also noting that "the gold is harder to find in the record's hazy second half". Pitchfork Media's Mike Orme expressed that "although Empire tries mightily, they collapse underneath too many ideas before the record is even half over." Gillian Watson of "The Skinny" expressed that the album "emulates '70s and '80s excess" and that "his lack of economy permeates the music itself, which lumbers one step shy of Daft Punk to land as dull, neutered MOR. Tacky drum beats and irritatingly nasal vocals compound the sense that this album is one that, while shooting for the heavens, utterly fails to transcend by dint of its clunky long-windedness."

Altrincham by-election, 1913

The Altrincham by-election was held on 28 May 1913.
Vacancy.
The vacancy occurred following the resignation of John Robert Kebty-Fletcher, the sitting Unionist member of parliament for Altrincham.
Electoral history.
Kebty-Fletcher had won the seat from the Liberal Party at the previous general election in December 1910 with a slim majority of 119 votes. 
Candidates.
On 2 May, the candidates for the by-election were selected. The Altrincham Unionist Association chose George C Hamilton of Knutsford, while the Liberals nominated the Honorable Lawrence Kay-Shuttleworth, eldest son of Lord Shuttleworth, Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire.
Campaign.
The writ for the by-election was moved on 8 May, and the date for the election was set as 28 May. The delay was due to allow for the week-long Whitsun holiday enjoyed by Manchester workers.
The Liberals had formed a minority government with the support of Irish Nationalists. As the price of Nationalist support the government was attempting to introduce Home Rule for Ireland.
One of the main issues in the contest was Home Rule The Irish Nationalist leaders John Redmond and T P O'Connor urged Irish voters to support Kay-Shuttleworth. Hamilton spoke out in support of the Ulster Unionists who were threatening armed insurrection to resist devolution. This led to the Manchester Guardian launching an attack on the Conservative candidate as a "revolutionist". The apparent lack of support for Hamilton by Kebty-Fletcher, and his treatment by the local Unionist Party caused some controversy, although he eventually issued a letter discounting the story.
The government majority had been reduced from 126 to 106 following the loss of a string of by-elections since December 1910. The Liberals hoped to reverse this trend by regaining the Altrincham seat.
The Liberal Government was planning on passing a Plural Voting Bill that sought to prevent electors who appeared on the electoral register twice from voting twice. Liberal and Unionist HQs were in agreement over 25 seats that were won by Unionists in December 1910 because of plural voting, and this was one of those constituencies.
The Altrincham Trades Council called on workers to vote against Hamilton, who as a major employer refused to pay union rates.
Result.
The Unionists easily held the seat with a greatly increased majority. This was however partly explained by an increase in the electorate of 1,939 voters since 1910. Nevertheless the result was deeply disappointing for the government. In contrast, Unionists were delighted, and Lord Londonderry, President of the Ulster Unionist Council sent a message of congratulation to Hamilton.
Aftermath.
Hamilton held the seat for ten years, losing to a Liberal candidate at the 1923 general election.

Hans Bemmann

Hans Bemmann (April 27, 1922 Groitzsch near Leipzig - April 1, 2003 Bonn) was an Austrian writer.
Hans Bemmann studied German language and literature and musicology in Innsbruck. He worked as an editor at the Austrian "Borromäuswerk", an association of Catholic libraries, since 1954 and continued to work in this function in Bonn from 1956 to 1987. From 1971 to 1983 he gave lectures in German studies at the "Pädagogische Hochschule Bonn". He also worked as a lecturer at the "Bonner Bibliothekar-Lehrinstitut" until 1993. In the 1960s he used the pen name Hans Martinson for his publications.
Work.
Hans Bemmann's literary break through was the fairytale fantasy novel "The Stone and the Flute" in 1983, that tells the adventures of a young man called "Listener" in an idyllic fairytale world. A magic stone and a magic flute are meant to lead him the way to happiness, but because of his lack of knowledge of the human nature and his naiveté he abuses his power and makes fateful choices. Fantastic encounters and long hardships give him new perspectives and deep human insights. The story of "Listener"'s life is interwoven with his love story.
Bemmann's next book, "Erwins Badezimmer" (Erwin's bathroom), an epistolary novel, shows the reader a dictatorship that controls its population by systematically simplifying its language. The good-natured linguist "Albert S." accidentally stumbles upon an underground movement, that is directed by "Erwin" from an illegal microform library in this bathroom. "Albert" finds the love of his life and learns to see the world from a new point of view based on the ambiguous use of language. The idea of manipulation by systematic use of language is also present in George Orwell's dystopia "1984".
"Stern der Brüder" (star of the brothers) is also set in a modern world and shows the path of life of two brothers in a society changing towards a dictatorship. A musician and a geologist, they choose opposing sides of the political spectrum, only to meet again in the end.
"The Broken Goddess" follows a fairytale researcher on a journey from reality into a fairytale world. An special encounter leads him there to search for, court and in the end find an enchanting woman. The novel mixes reality and fairytale and leaves the hero with a warmer and less mechanical view of the world.
"Die Gärten der Löwin" (the gardens of the lioness) can be read as a novel on its own, but is also a sequel to "The Broken Goddess", in which the heroine shows her story. This book differs from its prequel in syntax and choice of language, so that the author succeeds impressively in painting a different emotional world.
The third part in this series is "Massimo Battisti". Here many obscurities are resolved in the person of the mage "Massimo Battisti".
Awards.
In 2002 Hans Bemmann was awarded the Rheinischer Literaturpreis Siegburg.

Hapoel Beit She'an F.C.

Hapoel Beit She'an () is an Israeli football club based in Beit She'an. The club spent several seasons in the top division in the 1990s, but after several relegations, folded in 2006, and refounded in 2009.
History.
The club was founded in 1953, and was initially named Hapoel Beit She'an/Sde Nahum, as it replaced Hapoel Sde Nahum in Liga Bet. They remained in Liga Bet until 1976 when they were promoted to Liga Alef, and in 1978, to Liga Artzit, then the second tier. The club was relegated back to Liga Alef at the end of the 1983-84 season, but returned to Liga Artzit in 1986. Although they were relegated again, they returned to the second tier in 1993 under the management of Elisha Levy. In 1993-94 they finished second, and were promoted to Liga Leumit (then the top division) for the first time.
Following promotion, the club played its first four home matches in Tiberias whilst their stadium was upgraded. In their first season in Liga Leumit the club survived on the final day of the season, coming from 2-0 down to Maccabi Haifa (who were playing to win the title) to win 3-2. A film was made about the campaign, entitled "Underdogs: A War Story".
Levy left the club in 1995 but returned in 1997. On 2 May 1998 the club played Beitar Jerusalem (a match held at Kiryat Eliezer in Haifa on police advice) in a game that became known as the "shoelaces match", as Beit She'an were accused of allowing Beitar to win the match (and the title).
After several lower mid-table finishes, Hapoel were relegated at the end of the 1998-99 season. In 2001-02 they finished bottom of the second tier, and were relegated again. A third relegation occurred in 2003-04, this time to Liga Alef. At the end of the 2005-06 season they were relegated from Liga Alef, and folded.
Today, the club is united with Hapoel Mesilot and plays in Liga Alef as Hapoel Beit She'an Mesilot F.C.

Tourism in Uttar Pradesh

Situated in the northern part of India, bordering with the capital of India New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh is one of the most popular tourist destination in India. The most populous state of India, Uttar Pradesh is filled with its wealth of historical monuments and religious fervour. Geographically, Uttar Pradesh is very diverse, with Himalayan foothills in the extreme north and the Gangetic Plain in the centre. It is also home of India's most visited site, the Taj Mahal, and Hinduism's holiest city, Varanasi. Kathak, one of the eight forms of Indian classical dances, originated from Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is at the heart of India, hence it is also known as "The Heartland of India". Cuisine of Uttar Pradesh like Awadhi cuisine, Mughlai cuisine, Kumauni cuisine are very famous not only in India but also many places abroad.
Uttar Pradesh is known for ages for its rich culture and tradition. It is home to Ayodhya and Mathura birthplace of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna respectively. Uttar Pradesh attracts a large number of both national and international tourists. Taj Mahal, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in Agra is also located in Uttar Pradesh.
There are different places one can visit in Uttar Pradesh. Agra, Jhansi, Lucknow and Meerut are historical cities famous for their monuments. Mathura, Vrindavan, Gokul, Varanasi, Ayodhya and Allahabad are holy cities for Hindus and Kushinagar and Sarnath are important Buddhist places among the main four pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha. Noida is the most developed urban city of Uttar Pradesh.
Agra.
The 17th century Taj Mahal in Agra is the most popular monument in India, attracting over 2.5 million visitors per year. Agra is home to four World Heritage Sites in Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Sikandra & the Fatehpur Sikri. Agra is also home to many other beautiful Mughal buildings like Akbar's Tomb, Itmad-Ud-Daulah etc. Dayal Bagh is an under-construction temple that many visit. The lifelike carving in marble is not seen anywhere else in India.
Kumbh Mela.
Every year thousands gather at Allahabad to take part in the festival on the banks of the Ganges, the Magh Mela. The same festival is organised in a larger scale every 12th year and attracts millions of people and is called the Kumbha Mela. Kumbh Mela (especially the Maha Kumbh Mela) is the most sacred of all the pilgrimages. Thousands of holy men and women (monks, saints and sadhus) attend, and the auspiciousness of the festival is in part attributable to this. The sadhus are seen clad in saffron sheets with plenty of ashes and powder dabbed on their skin per the requirements of ancient traditions. Some called "nanga sanyasis" or 'Dhigambers' may often be seen without any clothes even in severe winter, generally considered to live an extreme lifestyle. This tends to attract a lot of western attention as it is seemingly in contrast to a generally conservative social modesty practised in the country.
Hindu religious sites.
Millions of tourists and pilgrims visit the cities of Allahabad, Varanasi, Mathura and Ayodhya, as those are considered to be the holiest cities in India.
Varanasi.
Varanasi (also called Kashi and Benares) is widely considered to be the second oldest city in the world after Jerusalem. It is famous for its ghats (steps along the river) which are populated year round with people who want to take a dip in the holy Ganges River.
Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi is home to the Vishwanath Jyotirling temple, which is one of the most sacred of Hindu Temples.
Mathura-Vrindavan.
Birthplace of Lord Krishana. Both Mathura & Vrindavan have beautiful temples devoted to Krishna. The place comes alive at the time of Holi, when a special brand of Holi called the Lath mar Holi is played here.
During Janmaashtami, the birth of Lord Krishna, there are huge festivities in the region.
Ayodhya.
Hindus believe the birthplace of Rama to be in Ayodhya at the place called Ram Janmabhoomi, the site of the demolished Babri Mosque.
Ayodhya is also the birthplace of five Tirthankars, including the first Tirthankar of Jainism, Shri Rishabh Dev. He is known as the father of Jain religion. The city is also important in the history and heritage of Buddhism in India, with several Buddhist temples, monuments and centers of learning having been established here during the age of the Mauryan Empire and the Gupta Dynasty. Ayodhya reached its glorious peak as known to history during the reign of the Guptas over India.
Bhagwan Swaminarayan, founder of the Swaminarayan Sect of Hinduism lived here during his childhood years. It was from Ayodhya that Bhagwan Swaminarayan started his seven year journey across India as Neelkanth.
Tulsidas is said to have begun the writing of his famous Ramayana poem Shri Ramacharitamanas in Ayodhya in 1574 CE. Several Tamil Alwar mention the city of Ayodhya. Ayodhya is also said to be the birthplace of Bhahubali, Brahmi, Sundari, King Dasaratha, Acharya Padaliptasurisvarji, King Harishchandra, Shri Rama, Achalbhrata, and the ninth Gandhara of Mahavir Swami.
The Atharva Veda called Ayodhya "a city built by gods and being as prosperous as paradise itself".

Shob Charitro Kalponik

Sob Charitro Kalponik, ( "All Characters are Imaginary") also known as Afterword, is a 2009 Bengali film by Rituparno Ghosh. The film stars Bipasha Basu and Prosenjit Chatterjee. This film is selected for the 30th Durban International Film Festival and won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali. '09
Plot.
Non-resident Bengali Radhika (Bipasha Basu) marries the thespian poet Indranil Mitra (Prosenjit Chatterjee) to settle in Kolkata. While Indranil continues his surveillance of the surreal world of words, rhythms, rhymes and imaginations Radhika single-handedly pulls out the private and public aspects of conjugal life. Radhika gets wholesome support from their housemaid Priyobala Das (also called Nondor ma). While the apparently irresponsible and introvert Indranil does one menace after other (like quiting his job after getting an award), Radhika stands like a rock to make the family exist materially. But all the reluctance and indifference from Indranil, makes Radhika’s heart oscillate towards Shekhar, her office colleague and Indranil’s biggest admirer. Radhika becomes attracted to Shekhar (Jisshu Sengupta) but can’t abandon the unpredictability and histrionics of her spouse.
The benevolent woman remains awe-struck when she hears about Indranil’s demise while she was aiding her ailing mother during the Durga Pujas. Life never becomes the same again for Radhika. She begins to discover the dead poet through a mystic and subtle journey. She discovers Indranil’s woman of fantasy, Kajori Roy (Paoli Dam). Through the journey, Indranil becomes more real to Radhika than what he was living. Radhika’s relation with Shekhar dies. She discovers that Indranil had lifted some of her own poems but through his she feels that the man was not indifferent to her. Radhika remains intertwined with the unknown galaxy of imagination within which she invents Indranil in an entirely unexplainable phenomena.
Critical Reception.
The movie was critically acclaimed because of its sensitive, subtle and somewhat abstract treatment of the two faces of love - the romanticised face, as portrayed by Indranil, and the practical side, as portrayed by Radhika. The poet Indranil, while romanticising even the drab day to day details of life in his creations, is often insensitive and irresponsible in real life. Radhika tries to keep the marriage together by taking care of the material aspects of their marital life, but Indranil's careless behaviour convinces her that he does not care about her. Frustration, as expected, gives way to an affair with a colleague, Shekhar, and Radhika contemplates leaving Indranil. However, even while thinking about divorce, she is unable to hide her true feelings for him. When Indranil passes away due to a sudden stroke, life changes for Radhika. Exploring his poems and stories after his passing, she realises that the muse Kajori is actually a romanticised version of herself - Radhika, as seen through Indranil's eyes. When she discovers that his last work was actually lifted from an English poem written by herself, she rants and fights with Indranil's empty chair - a culmination of the frustrated love and loss she had felt all her life. Even so, she feels closer to Indranil through his works than she ever had in his lifetime.
The film's main strength, perhaps, is the story. A story so commonplace it hits you hard, right in your heart. The story of a life that could have been but is now lost because we let unimportant things take priority. The story of being misunderstood because you cannot, or will not, express your true feelings. The story of the eternal struggle between art and practicalities. Rituparno, as usual, touches hearts and evinces tears with his heart wrenching narrative.
The power packed performances of the actors, especially Bipasha Basu and Sohag Sen as Radhika and Nandor Ma respectively, bring the story to life. Prosenjit as Indranil is extraordinary, while Jisshu as Shekhar, considering the limited potential of the role, does good too. Paoli as Kajori has hardly anything to deliver. While Prosenjit and Jisshu might have given better performances in many other movies, Bipasha is simply awesome in the role. It would not be incorrect to say that this is her best performance ever.

Marilyn Wood

Marilyn Wood is an American choreographer, intermedia artist, and dancer.
Marilyn Wood is an internationally renowned creator of contemporary, city-scale intermedia performances, otherwise termed “Celebrations,” that have taken place worldwide for the past 25 years. As a dancer/choreographer who “choreographs cities,” Marilyn Wood's Celebration Events bring communities together to celebrate their vitality and diversity in a unique experience of spectacle and participation in urban environments. Her work has been recognized as re-inventing the spirit and drama of the ancient festival in contemporary life.
Early years.
Her father’s career took her family to Puerto Rico where she spent her childhood years in the beauty and freedom of its tropical environment, taking drawing classes, performing in a small flamenco company, playing guitar, and singing South American folk songs. This experience proved to have a seminal influence on her future career.
Returning to Washington, D.C. for her last two years of high school, Marilyn studied painting at the Corcoran Gallery and then attended Oberlin College, with a career in the arts in mind, and graduated in 1950. She was soon drawn to the program of Moholy-Nagy’s Bauhaus Institute of Design in Chicago and their tradition-challenging approaches to the visual arts, architecture, and design. It was in experimenting with the dimensionality of sculpture combined with student dance classes in improvised movement that she had this epiphany: “I discovered I could BE the sculpture!” which led to two summer sessions with Hanya Holm at Colorado College and further solidified her shift from painting to dance.
Merce Cunningham Dance Company.
In New York City, her professional apprenticeship began with the Alwin Nikolais Company at the Henry Street Playhouse (1951-1957). This was followed by five years performing in the early Merce Cunningham Dance Company (1958-1963), and touring with John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, Merce Cunningham, and five other dancers: Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, Remy Charlip, Judith Dunn and Steve Paxton. Their touring repertoire in a VW bus with John Cage, music director(and driver), and Robert Rauschenberg, designer of sets, lighting and costumes, reflected the intense involvement towards all art-making aspects during the 50s and 60s in lower Manhattan. Marilyn danced in several notable pieces in the Merce Cunningham Dance Company including "Summer Space," “Rune,” “Antic Meet,” and “Crises,” now legendary works of the golden age of early modern dance.
The Celebration Group.
In 1968, inspired by her exposure to the environmental theatre of Anna Halprin, she stepped off the proscenium forever and formed Marilyn Wood and the Celebration Group. This group of 8-12 dancers, visual artists, filmmakers, architects, and musicians experimented with site-specific performance in many NYC venues. The genesis of her Celebration vision is a combination of her experience in the avant-garde art world as a dancer, and her personal history of living in a Latin culture where the arts energy expresses itself with extraordinary color, vigor, and participation in the streets and public places through community rituals, processionals, and festivals.
Celebrations in City Places: The Seagram Building.
In 1972, the Marilyn Wood & the Celebration Group became the launch pad for Marilyn to conceive, choreograph, direct, and produce her “Celebrations in City Places” series. The most ambitious of these was a site-specific performance at the Seagram Building on Park Avenue, New York City. Her choreography of this event activated the entire 44 stories of the façade, the lobby, and the plaza featuring 35 dancers inside and outside, original music, film projection, and participation, bringing the audience to the plaza as part of the grand finale.
The outstanding success of the Seagram project garnered her honorary membership in the AIA (American Institute of Architects) and launched her highly acclaimed, international career creating major commissions for numerous US cities (Charlotte, Kansas City, Columbus, Little Rock, Tulsa, and Denver) as well as globally in Berlin, Singapore, Teheran, Hong Kong, Rio de Janerio, Adelaide, and many others.
Marilyn is the Director of the International Center for Celebration, an international network of artists whose innovative forms embraced the spirit, scale and energy of the environmental and cultural venues of each project. The ICC has received many grants from the National Endowment for the Arts their first Creative Artist Fellowship to Japan and from the New York State Council on the Arts. She has also received many awards, given keynote speeches at international conferences, and participated in residencies and workshops around the world. Marilyn currently lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Celebrations choreography.
Woods' process often begins with use of environmental scores to involve the creativity of the local community of participating artists into initial ideas of the site design. This process was highlighted in her three weeks show “Citysenses” at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City in 1969. Her resulting choreography typically encapsulates all aspects of the site with a focus on the physical access of a large audience, often from many directions. The piece orchestrates local performing groups simultaneously at all entry points as an arrival experience as the audience gathers. The choreography includes dance sequences on rooftops, windows, fountains, plazas, parks, and waterfronts. This dance orientation extends to original music, soundscapes, fire and sky sculpture, inflatable forms, site generated films and video, daytime as well as nighttime fireworks. The design of the event offers visual access to all the sequences from one building to another, including deliberate choreographic gestures to move the attention of the audience to one aspect of the site to another.

Modern Physics and Ancient Faith

Modern Physics and Ancient Faith (2003) is a book by Stephen M. Barr, a physicist from the University of Delaware and frequent contributor to First Things. This book is "an extended attack" on what Barr calls scientific materialism. National Review says of the book: "lucid and engaging survey of modern physics and its relation to religious belief. . . . Barr has produced a stunning tour de force . . . [a scientific and philosophical breakthrough."
Contents.
The book is divided into five parts spanning 26 chapters. The main religious and philosophical themes include determinism, mind as a machine, anthropic principle, and the big bang theory.
Its main thesis is that science and religion only appear in conflict because many have "conflated science with philosophical materialism."

Giulio Camillo

Giulio "Delminio" Camillo (ca. 1480–1544) was an Italian philosopher. He is best known for his "Theatre of Memory", described in his posthumously published work "L’Idea del Theatro".
Biography.
Camillo was born around 1480 in Friuli, in the north-east of Italy, and probably spent his childhood in Portogruaro. He took his family name, Delminio, from the birthplace of his father, in Dalmatia (in present-day Croatia). He studied philosophy and jurisprudence at the University of Padua in the years around 1500, and subsequently taught eloquence and logic at San Vito, an academy in Friuli. In 1508 he was involved in the short-lived Accademia Liviana at Pordenone. The Academy attracted an eclectic mix of brilliant and radical thinkers. Here, Camillo would have come in contact with astronomer and physician, Girolamo Fracastoro, and the poets, Giovanni Cotta and Andrea Navagero. 
Around the first decade of the sixteenth century Camillo lived in Venice, where he was in close contact with some of the most influential writers and artists of Europe. He stayed near the house of the famous printer, Aldus Manutius, in the Sestiere di San Polo, in the centre of the city. He knew the philologist Desiderius Erasmus (although Erasmus and Viglius did not show much affection for Camillo's mysticisms) and worked with the painter Titian. He was part of the cultural circle that included Pietro Aretino and Pietro Bembo and had personal ties with the architect Sebastiano Serlio and his family. During this time, Camillo spent considerable care in charting regional differentiations in the Friulian dialect and was a champion of the local use of Italian, rather than Latin. Throughout this time he also worked on his ideas for the Theatre.
Camillo is believed to have held a chair of Dialectics at the University of Bologna from around 1521 to 1525; he attended the coronation of Charles V in 1529. 
In 1530, Camillo journeyed to Paris at the invitation of Francis I of France. He produced a manuscript titled "Theatro della Sapientia" in 1530, for Francis, in which his ideas for the Theatre were outlined. He impressed Francis and was given funds to develop his ideas, remaining in France till around 1537. 
Eventually, remuneration from Francis I began to dry up and Camillo decided to return to Italy. During the latter part of 1543, or very early in 1544, he accepted an offer to go to Milan. Here, after much persuasion, Camillo finally dictated his plan of the Theatre. The manuscript was completed early in February 1544. Three months later, on the 15th of May, Camillo died. "L’ Idea del Theatro" was finally published in 1550, in Florence, by Lorenzo Torrentino.
"L’Idea del Theatro".
Camillo's published output is small and "L'Idea del Theatro" is his most well-known work. "L'Idea del theatro" ("The Idea of the Theater"), opens with a warning concerning an ancient tradition of esoteric writing: 
The most ancient and wisest of writers have always been accustomed to recommending to their writings the secrets of God under obscure veils, so that they be not intended, unless by those who (as says Christ) have ears to hear--i.e. who by God are elected to intend his own most saintly mysteries. And Melissus Samos says that the eyes of vulgar wills ["animi"] cannot suffer the rays of divinity. That is confirmed with the example of Moses...
Elsewhere Camillo notes that:
"By the ancients thus it was custom that those same philosophers who taught and showed to dear disciples profound doctrines, having clearly declared them, would cover them with fables, so that the covers they made would keep the doctrines hidden: so that they would not be profaned".
At the end of the chapter titled "Le Gorgoni", Camillo identifies the faculty of "intending" with the "practical intellect" ("intelletto prattico"), which is elsewhere explicitly distinguished from the "acting intellect" ("intelletto agente"), as well as from Cicero's "the force of intelligence," which is vulgarly referred to as "ingenuity". In Camillo's "Theatro" each "image...will signify for us intelligible things that cannot fall under the senses, but that we can only imagine or intend illuminated by the acting intellect". While "Intellect is of the spirit", the "acting intellect" (Aristotle) is said to correspond to Plato's "mind" ("mente") and Augustine's "superior part" ("portion superiore"). In virtue of this intellect, we can "intend". The practical intellect, on the other hand, indicates "possessing" ("possedere") by "having already apprehended". In short, there are "three intellects" in us: 1) a "possible" ("possibile") or "passive" ("passibile") intellect, or ingenuity entailing the "ability" to intend; 2) the intellective faculty per se, or "intending" as "practical intellect"; and 3) the "active intellect" that makes us intend, just as the Sun allows us to see all things beneath it. Camillo argues against "philosophers ignorant of God" who identify the "active intellect" with human reason, insofar as this one is usually absent from men, who are merely capable of it. The "active intellect" must reside safely and eternally "in God", so as to safeguard man's capacity to reason. As other ancient mythic "images" or "symbols," that of the three "Gorgoni" is used to protect the verities of the mind, or "the mystery of truth" ("il mistero della verita') from being profaned. By casting the principle of reason in the authoritative form of God, philosophers who do "not" ignore God defend reason from being turned into an instrument of the physical senses below it.
Notes on the text.
Camillo notes that L’Idea del Theathro is concerned with ‘the eternal aspect of all things’. The book is arranged in seven sections that chart the creation of the world. Camillo speaks of a system that, as he says, makes ‘scholars into spectators’. He is imagining a theatre in its original sense – as a place in which a spectacle unfolds:
Following the order of the creation of the world, we shall place on the first levels the more natural things…those we can imagine to have been created before all other things by divine decree. Then we shall arrange from level to level those that followed after, in such a way that in the seventh, that is, the last and highest level shall sit all the arts… not by reason of unworthiness, but by reason of chronology, since these were the last to have been found by men. 
Camillo suggests that the world was made of ‘primary matter’. This primary matter was sometimes called ‘hyle’; it is the material of all that is manifest. Camillo thought that by reducing knowledge into its constituent parts, you could come closer to comprehending hyle, the original essence, and consequently understand what makes the world tick. Likewise (but in reverse) through comprehending the universe, you would understand its essential ingredients. His key to this was in the creation of a symbolic system that both represented the essence of material, as well as the relationships between the essences that allowed the universe to maintain its being. The ‘idea of the Theatre’ was fundamentally a structure of conceptual relationships rather than a building of wood or stone, and it is on that level that Camillo’s work bears most fruit. The Theatre is to be understood in terms of time and space - a spatial representation of chronology. 
The entire Theatre, says Camillo, rests on Solomon’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom. On the Seven Pillars rest the planets, which govern, or administrate, ‘cause and effect’. Camillo names these planets: the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. He omits the name of the earth. Arranged in an ascending order from the planets, and affected by their influence, are a further six levels, which, broadly speaking, represent a gradual development from nature to art. These upper levels are named: The Banquet, The Cave, The Gorgons, Pasiphae, The Sandals of Mercury and Prometheus. The Banquet and the Cave, are the most ‘elemental’ of the levels; these are the levels where creation first began. The levels of the Gorgons, and Pasiphae, are where the ‘inner’ man is revealed in relation to the cosmos; these levels are part nature, part art. The levels of the Sandals of Mercury and Prometheus are concerned specifically with man as an active agent within the world, or art and man.
Camillo and Erasmus.
Desiderius Erasmus, the philologist, probably met Camillo in Venice around 1506-9. Erasmus mentions "sharing a mattress" with Camillo as well naming him in his satirical "Ciceronianus" (1528). Erasmus was scathing of Camillo's work, and in a letter dated 5 July 1532 talks about the Theatre in terms of it being able to excite as great a "tragedy in study" as that which "Luther produced in religion". 
Camillo’s response to Erasmus, Trattato dell’ Imitatione, written in Paris, was published in the year of Camillo’s death, 1544. 
Art of memory.
Giulio Camillo, posthumously, was referred to by a number of artists and writers, including Bocchi, Ariosto and Rousseau. More recently his work has been interpreted in terms of a tradition of ‘Theatres of Memory’, for example in Frances Yates’s influential book, "The Art of Memory" (1966). This tradition has inspired artists from many disparate disciplines, amongst them, the writers, Ted Hughes (1992), Carlota Caulfield (2003), and Hilary Mantel in Wolf Hall (2009); visual artists, Jean Dubuffet (1977) and Bill Viola (1985); and composer John Buller (2003).

Calling Bulldog Drummond

Calling Bulldog Drummond is a 1951 British crime film directed by Victor Saville and featuring Walter Pidgeon, Margaret Leighton, Robert Beatty, David Tomlinson, and Bernard Lee. It featured the character Bulldog Drummond created by the novelist Herman Cyril McNeile, which had seen a number of screen adaptations. A novel tie-in was also released in 1951.
Drummond is called out of retirement by Scotland Yard to infiltrate a ruthless London crime outfit.
Plot.
After three robberies are pulled off with military precision, Inspector McIver asks Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond to give Scotland Yard a hand. As an ex-officer, Drummond knows how the suspected military mastermind would think. He agrees, though he very reluctantly accepts Sergeant Helen Smith of Special Branch as his partner, believing that women are not cut out for that sort of undercover work. 
Drummond arranges to get caught cheating at poker at his London club so he can drop out of sight. Smith causes a minor car accident involving Arthur Gunns, suspected of being in the gang. Gunns' attraction to Smith and carefully planted evidence showing "Joe Crandall" and "Lily Ross" to be criminals themselves enables the pair to infiltrate the gang.
However, Drummond's friend Algernon Longworth, who has been kept in the dark about the whole matter, becomes convinced that all is not what it seems. He telephones Colonel Webson, a member of Drummond's club, to get him to postpone Drummond's disciplinary meeting. Unfortunately, he inadvertently tips off the secret leader of the gang. Drummond and Smith are taken prisoner.
Gunns's girlfriend Molly convinces him to go ahead with the latest planned robbery, enough to set them up for life, despite the police having been put on alert by Drummond. She masquerades as Smith to give phony information to Longworth to pass along to the police regarding the target of the theft. Afterward, Longworth is tied up as well.
The gang steals £500,000 in gold being delivered by airplane. Drummond is able to overpower the guard and his friends before the gang returns. He knocks out Gunns (who has locked up and gassed his unsuspecting confederates nearly to death to avoid sharing the loot). Webson shows up and holds Drummond at gunpoint; he explains he got into the racket because civilian life turned out to be unbearably boring. However, the police arrive just in time and take him into custody.
Reception.
According to MGM records the film earned $372,000 in the US and Canada and $517,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $1,052,000.

Forest and Stream

Forest and Stream was a magazine featuring hunting, fishing, and other outdoor activities in the United States. The journal was founded in August 1873 by Charles Hallock. At the time of its 1930 cancellation it was the ninth oldest magazine still being issued in the US.
Published in New York City by Hallock in newspaper format measuring 16" x 11", it published many articles by "Nessmuk" (George W. Sears) in the 1880s that helped to popularize canoeing, the Adirondack lakes, self-guided canoe camping tours and ultralight camping. 
An early vehicle for conservationism, "Forest and Stream" was dedicated to wildlife conservation, helped to launch the National Audubon Society, was an early sponsor the national park movement, and supported the U.S.-Canadian Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. 
Naturalist George Bird Grinnell was editor for 35 years, and contributors included Theodore Roosevelt. Another notable contributor was Theodore Gordon, long considered "the father of American dry fly fishing," who began writing for the magazine in 1903. 
The magazine merged with "Field and Stream" in 1930.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is a British government department created on 3 October 2008 by Prime Minister Gordon Brown to take over some of the functions related to energy of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and those relating to climate change of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It is led by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, currently the Rt Hon Ed Davey MP.
The Department released a major White Paper in July 2009 setting out its purpose and plans. The majority of DECC's spending is on managing the UK's historic nuclear sites, in 2012/13 this being 69% of its budget spent through the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, and this is expected to increase when the last of the UK's Magnox reactors are shut down and no longer produce an income.

The DECC Ministers are as follows: 
Devolution.
The devolution of energy policy varies around the UK; most aspects in Great Britain are decided at Westminster. Key reserved and excepted energy matters (i.e. not devolved) are as follows:
Scotland 
Northern Ireland
Nuclear energy is excepted.
The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is responsible for general energy policy.
Wales
Under the Welsh devolution settlement, specific policy areas are transferred to the National Assembly for Wales rather than reserved to Westminster.

That is: suppose we have "a"(1) + ... + "a"("n") = "S"("n") − "S"(0), where "S"("n") is a hypergeometric term (i.e., "S"("n" + 1)/"S"("n") is a rational function of "n"); then necessarily "a"("n") is itself a hypergeometric term, and given the formula for "a"("n") Gosper's algorithm finds that for "S("n").
Outline of the algorithm.
Step 1: Find a polynomial p such that, writing "b"("n") = "a"("n")/"p"("n"), the ratio "b"("n")/"b"("n" − 1) has the form "q"("n")/"r"("n") where "q" and "r" are polynomials and no "q"("n") has a nontrivial factor with "r"("n" + "j") for "j" = 0, 1, 2, ... . (This is always possible, whether or not the series is summable in closed form.)
Step 2: Find a polynomial "ƒ" such that "S"("n") = "q"("n" + 1)/"p"("n") "ƒ"("n") "a"("n"). If the series is summable in closed form then clearly a rational function "ƒ" with this property exists; in fact it must always be a polynomial, and an upper bound on its degree can be found. Determining "ƒ" (or finding that there is no such "ƒ") is then a matter of solving a system of linear equations.
Relationship to Wilf–Zeilberger pairs.
Gosper's algorithm can be used to discover Wilf–Zeilberger pairs, where they exist. Suppose that "F"("n" + 1, "k") − "F"("n", "k") = "G"("n", "k" + 1) − "G"("n", "k") where "F" is known but "G" is not. Then feed "a"("k") := "F"("n" + 1, "k") − "F"("n", "k") into Gosper's algorithm. (Treat this as a function of k whose coefficients happen to be functions of n rather than numbers; everything in the algorithm works in this setting.) If it successfully finds "S"("k") with "S"("k") − "S"("k" − 1) = "a"("k"), then we are done: this is the required "G". If not, there is no such "G".
Definite versus indefinite summation.
Gosper's algorithm finds (where possible) a hypergeometric closed form for the "indefinite" sum of hypergeometric terms. It can happen that there is no such closed form, but that the sum over "all" "n", or some particular set of values of n, has a closed form. This question is only meaningful when the coefficients are themselves functions of some other variable. So, suppose a(n,k) is a hypergeometric term in both "n" and "k": that is, "a"("n", "k")/"a"("n" − 1,"k") and "a"("n", "k")/"a"("n", "k" − 1) are rational functions of "n" and "k". Then Zeilberger's algorithm and Petkovšek's algorithm may be used to find closed forms for the sum over "k" of "a"("n", "k").
History.
Bill Gosper discovered this algorithm in the 1970s while working on the Macsyma computer algebra system at SAIL and MIT.

Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes

The Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes was created by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, which transferred the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts in matters matrimonial to the new court so created. 
The Judge Ordinary of the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes also presided over the Court of Probate, but the two Courts remained separate entities.
On 1 November 1875, under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, the Judge Ordinary of the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes was transferred, as its President, to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice.

Lokomotiv-Versuchsamt Grunewald

The Lokomotiv-Versuchsamt Grunewald or LVA ('Grunewald Locomotive Research Office') was a facility established from 1920 to 1945 at Berlin-Grunewald in Germany that conducted trials on railway vehicles. The office used the facilities of the railway repair shop ("Ausbesserungswerk") at Grunewald on the Berlin Stadtbahn southwest of Berlin's Westkreuz station.
History.
After the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft was founded in 1925 the Railway Central Office ("Eisenbahn-Zentralamt" or "EZA") that had existed since 1906 was renamed to the Reichsbahn Central Office ("Reichsbahnzentralamt" or "RZA"). Amongst other things, they carried out numerous trials on steam locomotives and created the scientific basis for the performance measurement of railway vehicles. From 1920 they were supported by the Lokomotiv-Versuchsamt Grunewald, a locomotive trials office based at the main railway workshop at Grunewald. In 1936 there were 152 employees working for this research establishment.
In 1945 the work at Grunewald ended, due to the war, and was continued in East Germany at "RAW" Dessau as well as in Halle, and in West Germany initially at Göttingen, and later in Minden and München.
The Office had instrumentation vehicles, a rolling test bed with water brakes for locomotives and test rigs for various vehicle components.

Princess Françoise of Orléans (1902–1953)

Princess Françoise of Orléans (Françoise Isabelle Louise Marie; 25 December 1902, Paris – 25 February 1953, Paris) was born a Princess of Orléans and was a Princess of Greece and Denmark by marriage. She was thus a member of the Greek royal family. She was a descendent of Louis-Philippe of France.
Family, Marriage and issue.
Françoise d'Orléans was the second daughter of Jean d'Orléans, duc de Guise (an Orléanist pretender to the throne of France under the name Jean II) and his wife, the French Princess Isabelle of Orléans. Françoise's brother, Prince Henri, Count of Paris, succeeded their father as the Orleanist pretender, under the name Henri VI.
In Palermo on 11 February 1929, she married Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark (1889–1940). This was Christophe's second marriage - he was the younger son of King King George I of Greece (1845–1913) and his wife, Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia (1851–1926). Via his father, he was thus grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark (1818–1906), nicknamed "the father-in-law of Europe" due to his six children all marrying into other royal families. 
This royal marriage was unusual in that era, a Catholic marrying a non-Catholic (he was Greek Orthodox, whilst she was Roman Catholic). They had only one child, the writer Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark (born 1939), who married the Greek artist Marina Karella (born 1940) - that marriage did not conform to the laws of the royal house and thus deprived him of all right of succession to the Greek throne.
En 1939, naît, dans la capitale italienne, le petit Michel de Grèce, fils unique de Françoise et Christophe. Pour le couple princier, cette naissance constitue un grand moment de joie. Pourtant, cette fois encore, le bonheur ne dure guère et une autre catastrophe vient frapper la princesse. Au début de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, en 1940, son époux part à Athènes pour s'entretenir avec son neveu le roi Georges II des événements qui secouent l'Europe. Pendant son voyage, il contracte un abcès au poumon qui l'emporte en quelques semaines. Prévenue de sa maladie, Françoise d'Orléans tente de gagner la capitale hellène mais n'arrive qu'après le décès de son mari. En compagnie de son frère, le « comte de Paris », et de plusieurs membres de la famille royale grecque, elle assiste donc, impuissante, à l'enterrement de son époux à Tatoi.

Voss Line

The Voss Line () is a railway line from Bergen to Voss in Hordaland, Norway. It opened on 11 July 1883 and was extended to Oslo as the Bergen Line on 27 November 1909. It was built as narrow gauge, but converted to standard gauge with the connection with the Bergen Line. It was electrified in 1954, and shortened by the Ulriken Tunnel in 1963.
In addition to carrying long-haul passenger and freight trains on the Bergen Line, it is the main part of Bergen Commuter Rail. The Old Voss Line, the section from Arna to Bergen, has become a heritage railway.
History.
The first documented idea of building a railway between Norway's two largest cities was launched by Voss forest supervisor Hans Gløersen on 24 August 1871 in the Bergensposten newspaper. He suggested building the railway via Voss and Hallingdal to connect with the Krøderen Line. Back in 1866 he had launched the idea of the Jæren Line. Within days of the launch of the Bergen Line the city council had garnered support. In 1872 the railway director Carl Abraham Pihl and two engineers went on a survey tour to look at the suggested line. At the time it was common that proposals for railways came from local initiatives, and that local municipalities and private investors would then pay about 20% of the investments, the state covering the rest, mostly through foreign debt.
Political processes.
On 20 October 1871 two engineers traversed the two possible routes from Bergen to Voss; via Fana, Os and Hardangerfjord; and via Dale and Sørfjord. Though covering a less populated area, the latter would be cheaper to build, and have less elevation. A railway committee was created on 25 January 1872 with a limited mandate, which was increased on 20 December. At the same time there was a dispute between the Ministry of Labour and Pihl about whether to prioritize the Bergen Line, but in July 1872 surveys were performed in person by Pihl and two engineers, and their report was positive. At the same time he launched the idea of a branch line up Valdres to Lærdal.
By 1873 agreement had been reached as to the right-of-way to Voss, but not onwards towards Oslo. On 13 January 1874 Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, and to begin with 400,000 Norwegian speciedaler (NOK 1.6 million) was issued. In the 1873 parliamentary election railway supporter Peter Jebsen was elected, spending the next few years furiously defending the railway. Parliament did not endorse new railway projects in the 1874 session, instead making a complete plan for all railway construction, to be proposed by a committee. When the report was launched on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially due to the lack of capital available for local investors. This was based on a claim from Johan Jørgen Schwartz, the chairman of the committee, that the investment costs were underestimated. This was countered by Nils Henrik Bruun, a constructor from Bergen, who was willing to construct all the tunnels for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition was willing to act as personal guarantor for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted. On 9 June 1875 parliament voted 61 to 42 to build the line.
Construction.
The line was built to narrow gauge, . Construction started in December 1875, while the largest part started in March 1876. During the winter the engineers had made final adjustments to the plans. At any given time at least 800 men worked on construction, and at the peak 1,800 men were employed. They worked 12 hours per day, for which they had a daily wage of NOK 2.55, the highest wage for navvies in the country. To a large extent the labor came from Sweden, who had just finished the Norway/Väneren Line and had an excess of skilled labor for construction. This import of labor had the effect of pumping money into the local economy, and several taverns were built along the line. There were some accidents, and several deaths among the workers.
Construction finished in 1882 and some test services began, though not scheduled until the spring of 1883. Official opening was on 11 July 1883. Many of the navvies settled near the line, and started working for the Norwegian State Railways as part of the operation.
Merger.
On 27 November 1909 the Bergen Line opened from Voss to Hønefoss, and the Voss Line lost its independent status. The Bergen Line was built to standard gauge, so the line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted for the opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.
White coal across white plains.
Norway is a country with abundance of hydroelectricity and NSB saw huge amounts of money burned with imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line are as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and doubled, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 1930s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Counter suggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the outbreak of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 1950s was it again possible to afford such investments. Electric traction came into use on 2 July 1954.
Through the first mountain.
The first from Bergen to Takvam went a very roundabout way, and it was clear that it would be possible to reduce the line by with the construction of Ulriken Tunnel (), Arnanipa Tunnel () and Tunestveit Tunnel (). The idea was approved by parliament in 1956, based on private financing from the businessman Fritz Rieber. Construction started in 1959 with the tunnels being finished in 1963 while the tracks were finished laid on 29 May 1964 when the first train entered the tunnel.
Commuter rail.
NSB operates a commuter rail service from Bergen with two-hourly departures to Arna plus 14 daily departures to Voss, of which up to six continue to Myrdal. Rolling stock is Class 69 multiple units. The first part to Arna represents an important part of the public transport in Bergen, since the rail line through the Ulriken mountains is considerably faster than driving around.
Heritage.
Parts of the closed sections of the line, from Midttun to Garnes, has been converted to a heritage railway—the Old Voss Line—that is operated with steam trains by the Norwegian Railway Club during the summer.
The Flåm Line branch has been converted to a tourist route. The railway has spectacular scenery and a vertical descent of or 5.5% along the route from Myrdal to Flåm. It is operated by NSB, but marketed by Flåm Utvikling. El 17 locomotives haul B3 carriages, all painted green.

Hell Cave

Hell Cave () is a karst cave in the settlement of Zalog pri Šempetru in Slovenia.
Name.
Across Slovenia there are many oronyms, regional names, and microptoponyms named "Pekel" 'hell'. In folk geography, the name was used to metaphorically designate chasms, caves, shafts, and other narrow, dark places; for example, in Kropa there is an oeconym "Pekel" originally referring to a blacksmith's shop. Semantically related names in Slovenia include Devil's Hole () in the settlement of Okrog and Devil's Ravine () in the settlement of Parož. The cave's dark, black entrance inspired the idea that the Devil lived inside. Other stories of the name's origin say that one of the rocks near the entrance was thought to look like the Devil or that warm water vapor drifting from the cave in the winter had an eerie effect. See also Pekel, Maribor and Pekel, Trebnje.
Description.
The cave is long and has two levels. Peklenščica Creek runs through the caverns of the lower part of the cave and comes bursting out of a siphon as the highest-elevation accessible subterranean waterfall in Slovenia. The upper part of the cave is dry, but full of cave formations.
History.
The cave is more than 3 million years old. Finds of Neanderthal bones in the cave prove that the cave was used as a shelter by these early inhabitants of Europe. Wooden footbridges were set up in the cave in 1860, making it accessible to visitors. The cave became better known between 1860 and 1870, when it was explored by Anton Franz Reibenschuh, a professor from Graz. It was also explored at the end of the 19th century by Ivan Kač, a municipal secretary in Žalec. The speleologist Anton Suwa died in the cave in 1969. In 1972 the cave was opened to the public and it was visited by 25,000 people the following year. It has been managed by the local tourist association since 1972.

History.
The Swansea Magpies were one of the founding member teams of the W.A.R.F.L., playing their first season in 2008. Although in their first season the Magpies struggled to even field a team, they have grow into one of the strongest and most consistent teams in the W.A.R.F.L., competing in two successive grand finals in 2009 and 2010 against the South Cardiff Panthers.
With the 2012 season beginning soon the Swansea Magpies are actively recruiting new players for the new season.
Past results.
The Magpies struggled in their first year, finishing the season winless and in last position on the ladder. The following season, 2009, signaled a

2008 Morpeth floods

The 2008 Morpeth Flood occurred on Saturday, 6 September 2008. It was caused by heavy sustained rainfall in the preceding 24 hours. The River Wansbeck burst its banks and inundated the town’s flood defences around 1500 BST, causing damage to 995 properties, 906 of which were residential.
Background.
Previous flooding events occurred in 1863, 1876, 1877, 1878, 1881, 1886, 1898, 1900, 1903, 1924, 1963 and 1968 (Cotting Burn).
The last major flood to affect Morpeth had taken place on 7 March 1963. Unlike the 2008 flood, the primary cause was rapid thawing of snow and ice in the town and Wansbeck valley. The winter of 1962/3 was particularly harsh and snow had built up to over 3 ft in the upper valley areas. All this snow thawed in a 48 hour period, overwhelming the River Wansbeck drainage basin system. 482 homes and 21 businesses were damaged by the ensuing surge. In the aftermath a relief fund was set up, raising £16,000 that was paid out to 350 claims. An estimated £50,000 of losses was suffered by businesses and the local authority. 
Following the 1963 flood, a flood defence scheme was established. Flood walls were erected on the north bank to protect the main business district. Housing properties at Middle Greens on the south bank were also protected by flood walls.
In 1992, a record peak water level of was recorded in the river channel. The 2008 flood level was 0.8 metres higher than this. However, there was not a flood event in 1992 as the defences successfully protected the town centre.
Meteorological history.
The low pressure "Mattea" formed at the southern tip of Greenland on September 3, deepening to approximately 980hpa as it passed to the south of Ireland on September 5. The low then remained in place over the UK before dissipating on September 9. An occluded front associated with this low moved slowly north across the UK producing flash flooding across the Midlands and the North. The Environment Agency recorded of precipitation falling in the Wansbeck catchment between Friday 5 September and Saturday 6 September. Figures suggest that in Morpeth alone there was of rain compared to an average of for a month. Environment Agency statistics show that it was a unique event as peak river discharge was the highest that had ever been recorded.
Physical causes.
The River Wansbeck Valley is narrow and steep and as a consequence has exaggerated amounts of surface runoff. Based on three storm events, a reliable flow gauge located upstream of Morpeth at the confluence of the Wansbeck and Font showed that 56% of rain fall is converted into surface runoff. Because the soil was already saturated as a result of the wet summer, the effect of surface runoff was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment lag time (time lapse between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a LAG time of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by surface runoff and to a lesser extent by throughflow. This is due to the steepness of the valley and the soil composition.
Effects.
Social.
During 6 September 2008, more than 400 residents were evacuated. Shelter was provided in the Town Hall, King Edward VI High School and County Hall. An error made by the Environment Agency's warning system meant that 198 properties in the Middle Greens area of the town did not receive a flood warning. Fire fighters, ambulance crews, the RAF, the RNLI and the British Red Cross were among the emergency services involved in rescue and recovery operations over the weekend, as well as some local nurses, GPs, a pharmacist and school staff who volunteered once the news of the flood broke out. They worked through the night attending to those affected. Many residents were forced from their homes, and lived in caravans or with relatives as rebuilding took place.
Economic.
995 properties in Morpeth town centre were directly affected by the flood water. Among the businesses in the town centre, Smails and Sons, a shop that has been a cornerstone of the Morpeth community for over 60 years, was left completely out of stock. Early estimates suggest that damages could be over £10 million. However, the actual figure was much greater, with total losses estimated at £40 million. On Sunday 7 September, Morpeth Lions Club and the Red Cross launched the Morpeth Flood Disaster Fund and by Wednesday 10 September had raised over £20,000.
Environmental.
At the peak of the flood, Morpeth High Street (Bridge Street) was under of water. Not since 1963 had the main street been flooded. The library suffered severe structural damage due to the heavy debris transported by the river. Such was the extent of the damage that structural engineers were required to test its safety.
Aftermath and solutions.
On Monday 8 September 2008, John Healey, Floods Recovery Minister visited Morpeth. Official Government aid was pledged to the local authority to help with costs of the disaster through the Bellwin scheme. Mr Healey was also in talks with insurance industry chiefs, discussing their plans for dealing with a large number of claims in affected areas as quickly and effectively as possible.
Furthermore, discussions with the Environment Agency to bring forward proposals for new flood defences took place. An Environment Agency report of December 2007 suggested improvements are needed to the town flood walls. Oldgate Bridge may need some structural changes made as it has a damming effect during flood events. An upstream reservoir to hold back flood water was also proposed. If successful, improvements could be made by 2011.
Morpeth Lions Club aims to raise £100,000 which could be paid out to those without insurance.
TRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall made an official visit on Friday 12 September. During their visit they inspected the damage and spoke with victims of the flood.

Alexander Isaakovich Gelman

Alexander Isaakovich Gelman (; born 25 October 1933, Donduşeni), original given name Shunya (), is a Bessarabian-born Soviet and Russian playwright, writer, and screenwriter.
A survivor of the Holocaust during childhood, Gelman became a playwright and screenwriter after working as a newspaper journalist in Leningrad in the 1960s, winning the USSR State Prize in 1976. He has resided in Moscow since 1978.
A supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, Gelman was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1989 and to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union upon Mikhail Gorbachev's recommendation in 1990, before leaving the Communist Party of the Soviet Union less than a year later.
Biography.
Early years.
Shunya (later renamed Alexander) Gelman was born in Donduşeni (now in Moldova), a Bessarabian village that had been part of the Russian Empire before its Romanian annexation during the Russian Civil War and Soviet annexation in 1940. His parents were Isaak Davydovich Gelman (1904—1981) and Manya Shayevna Gelman (1910—1942). After the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, the occupying German forces deported the Gelman family to the Bershad ghetto in Transnistria, where his mother died. Only Alexander Gelman and his father (from 14 deported members) survived a death march upon leaving the camp near the end of the war.
Gelman graduated from a vocational school in Chernovtsy, Ukrainian SSR in 1951 and attended a naval school in Lvov (Lviv) in 1952-1954 and became an officer in the Soviet Navy, serving between 1954 and 1960 in the Black Sea Fleet's coastal defense and on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Soviet Far East. He also worked in factories and in construction.
In 1966 he moved to Leningrad, where he worked as a journalist for the municipal newspapers "Smena" ("The Work Shift") and "Stroitelny Rabochy" ("Construction Worker"). During this period he started learning and working on screenwriting.
Theatrical and movie career.
In 1970 he co-authored a screenplay (with his future wife Tatyana Pavlovna Kaletskaya). It was later filmed as "Night Shift". The next screenplay, also together with Tatiana, led to the movie "Xenia, Wife of Fyodor" (Lenfilm, 1974), which won an award in a USSR-wide competition.
His career reached an early peak with the 1974 play "Protokol odnogo zasedaniya" ("Minutes of a Meeting", also translated as "A Party Committee Meeting") and staged in Leningrad at the Gorky Bolshoi Drama Theater by Georgy Tovstonogov and a year later at the Moscow Art Theatre by Oleg Yefremov; it was filmed in 1975 as "Premiya" ("Salary Bonus"). It depicted a construction crew's rejection of a salary bonus on the grounds that they felt cheated by bad management and poor workplace organization. Acclaimed as a sociological drama, the film won director Sergey Mikaelyan and screenwriter Gelman the USSR State Prize in 1976. Many people called "Protokol odnogo zasedaniya" prophetic, "presaging the strikes of summer 1980 and the workers' movement in Poland."
Other plays are "Obratnaya svyaz"' (1976), "My, nizhepodpisavshiesya" [We, the undersigned (1979), "Skameika" bench (1983), "Zinulya" (1984), and "Poslednee budushchee" most recent future (2010). Boris Kagarlitsky writes of his plays (through the late 1980s):
Gel'man is free from naïve technocratic illusions; he knows economic reality other than by hearsay... Real people appear on the stage. Instead of Shatrov's faceless technocrats we see live production-workers who turn out to be very different, unlike each other, complex, unexpected... Gel'man's most recent plays ... localize the conflict, so to speak - confine it to a small group of people. More and more attention is paid to the conduct of particular individuals. ... There are no workers here. This is the world of lower and middle-ranking 'chiefs'. Bureaucracy. A milieu in which honesty is impossible, unattainable, having been eradicated. Love for one's job and confidence in one's rightness are also unattainable... We behold the anatomy of the bureaucratic world, its mechanisms, the Mafia-like bonds among the bureaucratic cliques, the formation of a 'clientage', and all the relationships that result.
Political career.
Elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1989, Gelman was an outspoken supporter of liberal changes and of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's "perestroika" and "glasnost" package in the 1980s, but in a 1989 interview with David Remnick of the "Washington Post" characterized the idea of the liberal politician Boris Yeltsin taking the place of Gorbachev was "a bit ridiculous". Supporting Gorbachev's new course against its critics, Gelman opined that "If the processes of democratization are halted, if perestroika is thrown out, a moral death awaits our party, the party of Lenin."
In 1990, Gorbachev personally recommended Gelman to become a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but left the party months afterward without stepping down from the Committee, prompting his fellow members to take the step of expelling him from the Central Committee afterward. An October 1991 "Washington Times" article described him as a "vocal anti-communist".
Gelman was a signer of the 1993 Letter of Forty-Two, an "Izvestiya"-published open letter containing a collective appeal by forty-two prominent literati calling on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to ban the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and nationalist organizations in the wake of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, a political stand-off between the communist- and nationalist-dominated legislature and the Russian president.
Since 2001 he is a member of public council of the Russian Jewish Congress.
On October 25, 2008, he received a birthday greeting from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

Lombardini S.r.l.

Lombardini S.r.l. is an Italian manufacturer of Diesel engines up to 65HP. The company was founded in Reggio Emilia by Mr. Adelmo and Mr. Rainero Lombardini in 1933 under the name of "Lombardini Fabbrica Italiana Motori S.p.A.". Adelmo Lombardini had already been manufacturing combustion engines since 1922 with a company called "Società Anonima Cooperativa Metallurgica" in Novellara (RE).
Along with engines, the company of the two Lombardini brothers manufactured finished products such as pumping sets. After World War II this trend increased with production of agricultural tractors and tillers.
History.
In 1963 a new premises was built in the outskirts of Reggio Emilia which marked the transition to large scale production. Taking advantage of the tumultuous growth of the Italian economy and of the ever increasing demand for agricultural machinery, Lombardini enjoyed a long and steady expansion resulting in the company becoming a leader in small agricultural equipment. At this stage the company decided to abandon production of finished products in order to focus on bare engines alone. This change reflected a strategic decision of the company not to compete against their own customers.
During the years Lombardini became the most prominent Diesel manufacturer in Italy in its range and bought out its competitors one by one. Slanzi, Cotiemme, Acme and lastly Ruggerini company were all bought out and incorporated into Lombardini.
As the growth of the company went on, its structure became more and more that of a modern industrial group. Commercial branches were established in the UK, Spain, France, Germany and US. Aside from the main premises in Reggio Emilia, new factories were established in Rieti (Italy), Czech Republic and India.
In 1999 Lombardini was sold to Mark IV Industries and in 2007 to Kohler Company becoming part of its Global Power Group.
Products.
Lombardini manufactures air- and water-cooled Diesel engines. It also has a small range of gasoline engines (petrol).
Water-cooled diesels.
Water-cooled Lombardini engines range from 440 to 2200 cc and from 11 to 65HP. They come as twin-, three- or four-cylinder.
Lombardini has engineered a 440cc engine with common rail, which is today the smallest common rail in the world.
Gasoline engines.
The range of Lombardini gasoline engines has shrunk in the years. Today only two models of gasoline are available, known as Intermotor's: a 9 and a 11 HP. One of those is the IM350, so often called "The world's best engine". Also a water-cooled gasoline engine 20HP is still in production. Lombardini being part of Kohler group is now marketing the Kohler gasoline engines which range from 4 to 40HP and come in a variety of models and configurations.
Applications.
Agricultural machinery.
Since its early days Lombardini has had a link with agricultural machinery makers. This results in many such applications coming with a Lombardini such as tillers, motor-hoes, small tractors and professional lawn-mowers. Many Italian OEMs like Goldoni, Ferrari, SEP etc. are customers.
A very famous mower binder of BCS has always been powered by Lombardini engines.
Construction industry.
The construction industry is the second field of application of Lombardini engines. Machinery such as trench rollers, reversible compactors, single drum rollers, vibratory plates, mini rollers etc. are and example of that. Some major European OEMs have some Lombardini in their products.
Automotive.
This is one of the latest market Lombardini has entered. It includes Micro cars (Ligier, Chatenet, Giotti etc.), Quads, ATVs and similar. For this market Lombardini has engineered a special engine 440 cc with common rail.
Other.
Other applications include Gensets and welders, tower lights, sweepers, high pressure cleaners, pumping sets, cranes, aerial platform and so on.
Licenses.
During the years Lombardini has had license agreements with companies in different countries. Such agreements allowed a local manufacturer to assemble Lombardini engines for its local market under the direct supervision of Lombardini.
All such agreements are now expired and nobody is currently authorised to assemble engines under the Lombardini brand except Lombardini itself. Lombardini is also no longer involved in ensuring the quality of such productions and where they continue the engines can not be considered genuine Lombardini engines.

Tonight We Have the Stars

"Tonight We Have the Stars" is a rock song written by Bryan Adams, Gretchen Peters and Jim Vallance for his tenth studio album "11" (2008). The song's musical-style and production were heavily inspired by rock and pop music from the 1980s, and its lyrics chronicles a relationship. The single was released worldwide on May 30, 2008 and later as a digital single on June 6, 2008. The B-side is a live solo acoustic performance of "Somethin' to Believe In" in Barcelona, Spain from his digital UK EP "Live From Barcelona".
Recording and production.
"Tonight We Have the Stars" was written by Adams, Gretchen Peters and Jim Vallance. When writing the song, the three e-mailed each others audio files back and forth, with each of them commenting on the song when received. This process continued until the song was completed. As Vallance later wrote on his webpage;
"This is my 'first draft' of 'Tonight We Have The Stars' (the original "audio email" that I sent to Bryan). It was a quick recording done in my home studio in Vancouver, but Bryan was able to turn this humble snippet into a song."
The song was mixed by Bob Clearmountain at his studio in Los Angeles. As stated by Vallance: "I was in Canada, Bryan was in Brazil, and Ben Dobie was in England. Give or take a few milliseconds, we were all hearing the mix "live", streaming on a dedicated, encrypted iTunes channel." After each pass of mixing Vallance and Adams would send comments to him on iChat. After giving Clearmountain a comment he would "roll tape" again, and we'd hear the suggested changes unfold in close-to-real time. As stated by Vallance:
"This might not seem unique to everyone, but for me, considering the technology that existed when I started in the music business nearly 40 years ago, this is like science fiction. I can only imagine where things will be, 40 years from now!"
Reception.
Following statement is from a review by Kirk LaPointe, managing editor of "The Vancouver Sun"; 
"Arguably the strongest song on 11, Tonight We Have The Stars has a serendipitous quality that speaks volumes about how Bryan works and networks: a lyric from last decade with Gretchen Peters, a new piece of music sent by Vallance and a new melody from Adams. He pulled the pieces off his Mac on an airplane and began mumbling the result to the surprise of his seatmates. Presto, the song that built the foundation for the album".
Daily Mail have called "Tonight We Have the Stars" as one of album's highlights, and Darryl Sterdan, in his review for Jam! have stated that the song is "a classic Adams opening gambit -- he starts out with moody verses, then kicks into gear with an arena-ready chorus". However MusicOMH was not too impressed by the song calling it has "requisite croaky vocals and anthemic radio-friendly chorus, but there's nothing to move or touch you."
Music video.
The Music video for the song is identical to the previous single's video. Bryan and his band play the song live in a studio. It was available on his website for a time, and is to be included with the upcoming DVD.

<doc id="19590950" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19590950" title="Pearson v. Callahan">
Pearson v. Callahan

Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court.
The Court took to the unusual step of asking the parties to argue whether past precedent should be overturned. The theory under that 2001 decision, "Saucier v. Katz", is that without courts first ruling on constitutional questions, the law would go undeveloped in many areas. However, many legal commentators have criticized the ruling in "Saucier".
Background.
In 2002, a confidential police informant working with five officers from the Central Utah Narcotics Task Force went undercover at the Fillmore, Utah mobile home of a suspected drug dealer, Afton D. Callahan, to purchase $100 worth of methamphetamine. The officers had arranged for the informant, who was wired, to give them a sign indicating a successful drug deal; when he did, they entered the home.
The case focuses on "consent once removed," a theory espoused by some lower courts that acts as an exception to the search warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Under the doctrine, if a suspect to a crime opens the door for an undercover police officer, the suspect unknowingly is also allowing further police officers to enter without a warrant. In the criminal case at issue in this civil case, the police officers sent an undercover informant in to make a drug deal. When the informant succeeded, the police officers then entered Callahan's home without a warrant. The police in the case argue that "consent once removed" applies, since the informant was acting as an agent of the police. 
The criminal charges against Callahan were handled in Utah state court. The judge rejected Callahan's argument that the evidence obtained from the search was unconstitutional, and Callahan accepted a conditional guilty plea while he appealed the constitutionality of the case. A Utah appeals court found in Callahan's favor, overturned the guilty verdict, and declared the search unconstitutional. 
Callahan then filed a civil lawsuit against five members of the Central Utah Narcotics Task Force who had conducted the search, claiming they violated his Fourth Amendment rights. If the case was not decided in the officers' favor, they would face the prospect of paying monetary damages to the plaintiff. The officers claimed that they could not be sued due to Qualified immunity, a doctrine that states government officials cannot be held liable for violating a facet of the Constitution that is unclear.
The question has divided lower courts, which disagreed about the "consent once removed" doctrine. Federal judge Paul G. Cassell said in 2006 that even if the search was unconstitutional, the police officers could be granted immunity because at the time of the search, it would have been reasonable for them to believe that it was constitutional. He noted that three federal circuits abided by "consent once removed," although not the one under which Utah falls into jurisdiction. 
However, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled against the officers' claim of immunity and allowed Callahan to proceed with the lawsuit. The court did not adopt "consent once removed" as other federal circuits have done. The appeals court said that a reasonable police officer would have known not to proceed in the case without a warrant.
Supreme Court case.
The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in March 2008. 
The justices added another issue to the officers' request for certiorari, that of how to deal with officers' requests for immunity from constitutional issues. This issue was last heard in the highest court in 2001 in "Saucier v. Katz", in which the justices ruled that a certain order had to be prescribed to such suits, first deciding the constitutionality and then deciding if the law had been unclear enough for officers not to be liable. "Saucier v. Katz" is a widely criticized ruling because it has resulted in judges spending time deciding difficult constitutional issues, even in cases where official immunity obviously applies and the case will eventually be thrown out. One such case that went to the Supreme Court was "Morse v. Frederick".
Supreme Court Decision.
The Court's decision severely limited "Saucier v. Katz". The Court modified "Saucier's" two-step inquiry in two ways. First, it eliminated the requirement that qualified immunity issues be considered in order. Thus, courts after "Pearson" can first consider whether federal law forbidding an action was clearly established at the time of that action, instead of first analyzing the sometimes more difficult question of whether the law "actually" forbid the action, regardless of its clarity. Second, it made "Saucier'"s two-step process advisory. The Court said: "we conclude that, while the sequence set forth (in "Saucier v. Katz") is often appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as mandatory."

Ernesto Paglia

Ernesto Paglia is a Brazilian television journalist currently working for Rede Globo.
Biography.
Paglia was born in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1959. Studied Journalism at the School of Communications and Arts at the University of São Paulo. Began working at 19, while still in the third year of Journalism School, (which requires 4 years in Brazil). Paglia was hired as reporter by Jovem Pan radio, but lasted only 3 months in this first job. He was fired after taking part in a strike led by the Journalist Union of S.Paulo in May 1979. Immediately after, began working as nightshift reporter for the S.Paulo local station of Rede Globo, the main Brazilian commercial television network. In 1980, only one year later, Paglia was already being assigned to cover important events, such as the São Bernardo's metalworkers' strikes that opposed the military regime and brought to prominence the future two-term president, then union leader Luís Inácio "Lula" da Silva. The same year, Paglia joined one of two special itinerary crews created by Globo to cover the first visit of Pope John Paul II to Brazil.
Career.
In 1982, Paglia was sent to Spain for his first FIFA World Cup coverage. He would take part in the news coverage of 6 other World Cups (Mexico (1986), Italy (1990), USA (1994), Japan/S.

Since then, Paglia has been involved in the production of more than 60 documentaries, mostly covering environmental issues. Traveling extensively for Globo Repórter's productions, Paglia has visited the Arctic and Antarctica twice, and has been to Asia, Middle East, Africa and South America.
In 1986, Paglia became one of the youngest ever Globo's international correspondents, based at the prestigious London Bureau. During three years, he would cover European current affairs, Brazilian interests in the region and Africa, and the Iran-Iraq war, visiting Baghdad and Basrah. In 1989, Paglia returned to Brazil to work, primarily, for the main nightly news bulletin on Brazilian television, Globo's '"Jornal Nacional".
Paglia took part in shaping the first news only Brazilian television channel, News, creating and presenting the weekly news review talk show "Painel" for 3 years. The journalist left again for London in 2000, for another 2 year long period as international correspondent, when he covered the Palestinian Intifada and the American invasion of Afghanistan. He was selected "best Brazilian TV reporter" by the Comunique-se Journalism Award four times, in 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2011.

Globo Mar aired with successful ratings for 4 consecutive seasons until 2013, year in which the show, representing TV Globo, was awarded the Marine Honorable Mention at the SOS Mata Atlântica/Conservation International Reports Award.
In 2010, Paglia headed the team of 8 journalists and TV engineers formed for project "JN no Ar" ( Jornal Nacional on Air) . The initiative was developed as a new format to produce original stories for the coverage of Brazilian reality ahead of the 2010 presidential elections. The project consisted of a sequence of 27 stories, one per day at each of the Brazilian states (including the Federal District, Brasília). Aboard an executive jet plane, the crew criss-crossed daily the continental country to get to cities chosen by a draw, realized live every night during Jornal Nacional, main Globo's news bulletin. The marathon was described by the reporter in the book "Diário de Bordo do JN no Ar:Cruzando o país numa cobertura histórica" ( "JN on Air - A log book: crossing the country on a historic coverage" ), published in May 2011 by Editora Globo.
Personal life.
Paglia has 3 children and is married to television journalist Sandra Annenberg.

BL 4 inch naval gun Mk I – VI

The BL 4-inch gun Mk I - Mk VI were a family of early British breech-loading 4-inch naval guns.
History.
13 cwt Mk I, 15 calibres.
This was the first 4-inch BL gun. With its short (60-inch total) barrel it had a range of only 5,500 yards.
22.5 cwt Mk I, 25 calibres.
With its longer barrel (100 inch bore) Mk I had a range of 7,200 yards.
Both early Mk I types were quickly withdrawn from service following the explosion of a similar BL 6 inch Mk II gun on board HMS "Cordelia" in June 1891. Mk I 22.5 cwt continued to be used for training.
26 cwt Mks II - VI, 27 calibres.
The improved 27-calibres Mk II gun and subsequent Marks, often referred to as 4 inch 26 cwt, replaced the early Mk I versions in service. The longer barrel (108 inch bore : 27 calibres) gave it a range of 7,700 yards.
Mk II guns and later Marks armed the following warships :
The gun was succeeded in its class from 1895 by the QF 4 inch gun Mk I.
QFC 4 inch gun.
A small number of these guns were converted to QF to use the same cartridges as the QF 4 in gun. They were designated Mk I/IV, I/VI etc. depending on which Mark of BL 4-inch had been converted. All had a bore of 27.85 calibres after conversion, with a muzzle velocity of 2,177 ft/second.

Landgravine Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt (1757–1830)

Louise Auguste of Hesse-Darmstadt (30 January 1757, Berlin – 14 February 1830) was a German princess. She was the daughter of Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. On 3 October 1775 she married duke (later grand-duke) Charles Augustus of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and as such a member of the court sphere of Weimar Classicism. She was held to be serious and introverted but also compassionate and sympathetic, in the aftermath of the Battle of Jena which guaranteed her part in the later "myth of Weimar" ("Weimarmythos").
Life.
Early life.
The princess belonged to the House of Darmstadt, which held the Hessian landgraviate. She was born on 30 January 1757 in Frederick II's Prussian capital, Berlin, where her parents were due to the Seven Years' War. Her father Louis IX succeeded to the landgraviate in 1768 and was at the time of her birth fighting as a general for the Prussian forces. He was thus often away from his children and so the princess's education was in her mother Caroline's hands. Caroline educated Louise in the evangelical Protestant tradition, and she became interested in literature and music.
As the youngest daughter, with eight siblings, Louise's education was important to improve her marriage prospects. Since Louis IX showed little interest in his children, it was vital to get Louise married off and a matter also in the hands of her mother, becoming known as the "great Landgräfin" and von Zweibrücken due to her expert international dynastic politics in ancien regime Europe. In 1773 Louise travelled with her mother and sisters Amalie and Wilhelmine to Beschau then to the Russian court in St Petersburg. Tsarina Catharine II decided Louise was unsuitable as a wife for the grand-prince and future Tsar Paul, preferring her sister Wilhemine. This rebuff and her relationship with her future brother-in-law Paul formed Louise, leading to her being a persistent influence in the Russian state.
Nevertheless this journey was not without influence on Louise, since on the way to Russia Caroline had learned of another female regent of a small German state - Anna Amalia. Anna and Louise probably found favour together.
Marriage.
At the end of this acquaintance, under the influence of the governor in Erfurt from the Archbishopric of Mainz, Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, the 18-year-old Louise was betrothed to the young knight Carl August of Sachsen-Weimar. The marriage occurred on 3 October 1775 at the Karlsruher court, where (as a new princess-consort) Louise became caught up in the Ernestine Weimar court.
The marriage was wholly dynastic in purpose (her sisters were married off to heir to Prussia and the Tsarevitch), consolidating the duchy of Saxe-Weimar's place at the heart of the Holy Roman Empire. Primary and secondary sources agree that it was as unhappy, with Louise (noted for her delicacy and timidity) had difficulty fitting in at court and remained in the shadow of her mother-in-law, the dowager duchess Anna Amalia. Louise especially attended the convents in her new country. A Romantic "avant la lettre", she did not have a taste for the Romantic lifestyle. Goethe was court poet and minister to her husband (and his companion in his extra-marital affairs), but was moved by her charm, noble-heartedness and her eyes "the colour of cornflowers". Taking her under his wing, Goethe dedicated the following words to her:
She gave birth to a princess in 1779, who died at five, and their other children all died after only a few days. At this time the Weimar ducal court also went through its sturm und drang phase, drawing not only Goethe but also the Ernestines from Miseleien and Eseleien. The resulting emotional coldness did not help their marriage, with her husband publicly humiliating the marriage by a long-term affair with the actress Karoline Jagemann. Louise only gave him an heir for him in 1783, with the birth of Charles Frederick. With the birth of prince Bernhard in 1792 the marriage had finally served its purpose of guaranteeing the succession to the throne and the continuation of the dynasty. Charles Frederick later married Maria (sister of Alexander I of Russia, and their daughter Augusta of Saxe-Weimar married prince Wilhelm of Prussia, thus becoming the first empress of Germany.
Napoleonic Wars.
Louise had her great moment in October 1806. Despite her childhood and her early experiences in Weimar, she was a great influence in literary circles. The battle of Jena-Auerstedt (14 October), led to the defeat of the Prussian-Saxon forces and the total submission of all the German states to France and precipitated the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. Soon after the battle, the victorious French troops advanced on Weimar. The other family members either fled or were away fighting in the Prussian forces, and so Louise remained in Weimar as mother and protector of the nation.
Two days after the battle she ended up opposing Napoleon himself. He insisted that her husband withdraw from Prussian military service but she quite undiplomatically made it clear to Napoleon that he could not do so. Nevertheless, at her husband's request and inspired by the example of the German patriot queen Louise of Prussia, she managed to arrange the French plundering of the area so that Weimar got of lightly compared to the university-city of Jena. Whether Napoleon let himself soften towards Louise, or whether he acted this way due to his own calculations in power-politics remains open to discussion. The Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach duchy remained with the alliance upon the Treaty of Poznań and survived the Napoleonic era via further politicking. Since Louise was now considered as the country's leader, and her subjects and contemporaries maintained this image of her - along with her part in the Weimar myth.
In 1815 her politicking during the war ensured that at the Congress of Vienna her husband's small duchy not only retained all its territory but rose to become a grand duchy (her Thuringian cousins the house of Saxony, in contrast, merely preserved their title of duke). She then became devoted to ambassadorial duties. The Russian alliance ended with her successor Maria Pawlowna. The jubilee of her rule and her golden wedding, both in 1825, passed with little celebration and - already very withdrawn - she died aged 73 on 14 February 1830.
Marriage and issue.
She and Charles Augustus had 7 children:

Paper street

A paper street is a road or street that appears on maps but does not exist in reality. Paper streets generally occur when city planners or subdivision developers lay out and dedicate streets that are never built. Commercial street maps based only on official subdivision and land records may show these streets, which are legally public rights of way though usually undriveable.
Paper streets (and, by extension, paper towns) may be deliberately included in published maps as trap streets, forming a copyright trap.
A play on the term is found in Chuck Palahniuk's novel "Fight Club", as well as the film based on that book, where the protagonist lives in a house on "Paper street".
Paper towns play a large role in John Green's novel, "Paper Towns".

Buckland House

Buckland House is a large Georgian stately home and the manor house of Buckland in the Oxfordshire, England (formerly in Berkshire). It is a masterpiece of Palladian architecture erected by John Wood, the Younger for Sir Robert Throckmorton in 1757.
Buckland House stands with extensive grounds known as Buckland Park, which includes gardens, a cricket ground and a deer park. The previous manor house, Buckland Manor House, also stands in the park. Buckland House is a Grade II* listed building in the Palladian style. Nikolaus Pevsner described it as "the most splendid Georgian house in the Country", It is rumoured that a ghost of a white lady haunts the house.
Owners.
In the mid-1750s Sir Robert Throckmorton had Buckland House build to replace his previous manor house. Following his death in 1791, Sir John Courtenay Throckmorton inherited the estate. Between 1870-1872, it was said the house had relics of Mary, Queen of Scots and Charles I, some other curiosities and some fine pictures. 
Sir Maurice and Lady Fitzgerald took over the property from the Throckmortons and lived there until 1947. Visitors to the house during the Fitzgeralds' tenure included Winston Churchill and Queen Mary, who had objets d'art stored in the basement during World War II. Buckland House then passed to Major Richard Wellesley, grandson of Lady Fitzgerald 
In 1962 Major Richard Wellesley advertised Buckland House in "The Times" for ""£8 a week"". In 1963, it became an independent university college (University Hall, Buckland) offering London External degrees. 
In 2004, motorcar driver Paddy McNally bought Buckland House and began a major restoration to its former glory. 
Architectural history.
Original House.
The Throckmortons owned the Buckland estate since 1690, living in the manor house but it was Sir Robert Throckmorton, the fourth baronet of Coughton, who commissioned John Wood (the Elder) of Bath to design the new Buckland House as a shooting lodge and weekend retreat. John Wood, the Younger substantially revised the plan and added the distinctive octagonal pavilions to the sides of the house. The final house is illustrated in the 1767 volume of "Vitruvius Britannicus".
The house includes features such as marble fireplaces, exquisite mouldings, cornicing and painted ceilings. It is symmetrical and long passages lead to the two octagonal pavilions, used today as a library and dining room. 15 bedrooms were built into the house in total to hold both family and staff. It is rumoured that one of the bedrooms was designed as a copy of Marie Antionette's bedroom from Versaille. The saloon has Corinthian pilasters, bold cornices and well carved festoons
1908 Additions.
The new owner engaged the architect W. H. Romaine-Walker to enlarge the property, addings wings on the north front to house a Billiard Room and a Royal Suite, rumoured to have been built to make the property large enough for King Edward VII to visit. Additional rooms were added upstairs in the property too, taking the total number of bedrooms to 19. Finally, a rear terrace was also added.
Recent alterations.
With the last planning permission on the property approved in 1993, the owners of Buckland House started applying for planning permission to improve the property:
Gardens.
The entire landscape garden was designed by Richard Woods, a contemporary of Capability Brown. The lakes were designed to look like a part of the River Thames and were joined with a small waterfall.
During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century there was further landscaping and planting, supervised by Sir John Courtenay Throckmorton.
In 1908 Romaine-Walker created the formal terrace on the north front as part of the broad redevelopment commissioned at that time. Lady Fitzgerald supervised the construction of a water garden with rock paths on the north side of the lake.
The garden is occasionally open to the public under the NGS Gardens Open For Charity scheme with the entrance fee donated to the Richard Wellesley Memorial Transport fund.
Icehouse.
An icehouse, also designed by Richard Woods, was sited half way between the two lakes on a north facing slope behind the house. The portico matches that of Buckland House. The icehouse is a cup and dome design, built partially underground and with a thatched roof, all to increase insulation. It was the subject of a local history article published on the BBC website. Estate workers would break ice from the pond with picks and saws, relay it to the shore and then quickly take it to the icehouse. Once there, it was packed hard to make maximum use of the interior. Throughout the year, manageable lumps of ice would be taken to the house, placed in ice-drawers in the kitchen larder and then used for food preservation and making iced confections. This method enabled ice to be available through the summer months.

The Festival Hall of Thutmose III ("Akh-menu"). It is normally translated as "the most glorious of monuments", but "monument to living spirit" is an alternative translation since "akh" can mean either "glory" or "blessed/living spirit" (For instance, Akhenaten is often translated as "living spirit of Aten"). It is located at the heart of the Precinct of Amun-Re, in the Karnak Temple Complex, in modern Luxor, Egypt. 
Located at the end of the Middle Kingdom court, with its axis at right-angles to the main east-west axis of the temple, it was originally built to celebrate the jubilee (Hed-Sed) of Thutmose III, and later became used as part of the annual Opet Festival. It is seemingly decorated to echo a huge tent shrine, complete with awnings and tent poles. In this temple, the Karnak king list, shows Thutmose III with some of the earlier kings that built parts of the temple complex.
Layout.
Built at the eastern end of Karnak's main axis, and enclosed in its own walls, this building is little understood and its exact purpose is still unclear. It consists of three main parts, a suite of rooms dedicated to Sokar to the south-east, a solar complex to the north-east and the festival hall itself, from which the other areas of the building can be reached. This is known as the 'Hry-ib', or "that which is at the heart of it". The only original entrance was in the south-west corner. The walls contain the Botanical garden of Thutmosis III.
Main hall.
In a small room off of the main hall, there is a room referred to as the Chamber of Ancestors, where a large inscription, the Karnak king list, shows Thutmose III making offerings to his 61 ancestors. The originals of these were removed and are now located in the Louvre in Paris.

Dimethenamid

Dimethenamid is a widely used herbicide. In 2001, about 7 million pounds of dimethenamid were used in the United States. Dimethenamid is registered for control of annual grasses, certain annual broadleaf weeds and sedges in field corn, seed corn, popcorn and soybeans. Supplemental labeling also allows use on sweet corn,
grain sorghum, dry beans and peanuts. In registering dimethinamide (SAN 582H/Frontier), EPA concluded that the primary means of dissipation of dimethenamid applied to the soil surface is photolysis, whereas below the surface loss was due largely to microbial metabolism. The herbicide was found to undergo anaerobic microbial degradation under denitrifying, iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, or methanogenic conditions. In that study, more than half of the herbicide carbon (based on 14C-labeling) added was found to be incorporated irreversibly into soil-bound residue.

Moonlight in Vermont (album)

Moonlight in Vermont is a 1952 jazz album by jazz guitarist Johnny Smith, featuring tenor saxophonist Stan Getz. Titled for Smith's breakthrough hit song, it was the #1 Jazz Album for 1952. It was popularly and critically well received and has come to be regarded as an important album in Smith's discography, in the cool jazz genre and in the evolution of jazz guitar. Notable songs on the album, which reveal the influence of Smith's experiences with NBC Studio Orchestra and as a multi-instrument musician, include the title track and the original composition "Jaguar". The title track, singled out for its virtuosity, was a highly influential rendition of a jazz standard that secured Smith's position in the public eye.
Originally released on Roost Records, the album was reissued in significantly expanded form by Roulette Records in 1994, with more material including a previously unreleased version of "Jaguar".
Reception.
Well-received, the album became the #1 Jazz Album for 1952, a position it attained, according to the retrospective book "Gibson Electrics", as an "overnight best-seller capturing the essence of the cool jazz era." Critically regarded as one of the defining albums of cool jazz, it is listed in "A Concise History of Electric Guitar" among those few recordings which "firmly established" the electric guitar's "sound in popular culture, elevating it from the dark dissonance of bebop jazz to the more consonant textures of a rapidly developing style called western swing." "Guitar World" characterizes it as Smith's "classic album".
Songs.
Most notable among the album's songs is the title track, "Moonlight in Vermont", a rendition of a John Blackburn and Karl Suessdorf standard. According to Getz biographer Dave Gelly, the song became an "unexpected hit", an unusual occurrence in jazz music, remaining on the charts for months. It was for this rendition that Smith earned the title "King of Cool Jazz Guitar." "Moonlight in Vermont" was Smith's breakthrough song, launching him into public awareness. It also increased the profile of Getz and resulted in his receiving a contract from renowned jazz producer Norman Granz.
The song is noted for its guitar virtuosity. "The New York Times" noted that Smith's arpeggio on the song "went from the lowest to the highest reaches of the guitar, all in one fluid movement." "Echo and Twang" characterized it as "complete with Smith's clear, reverb-tinged sound, his fleet-fingered but relaxed three-octave runs, and above all his lush, close-voiced, chord melody style." "Guitar World" described it as "a perfect illustration of [Smith's] mastery of the guitar's subtle inner-string voicings".
According to "Guitar World", the rendition was influential, becoming "the template for every guitarist to come". Smith's performance of the song was a favorite of guitarist Eddie Cochran and first turned Herbie Hancock on to jazz. James Sallis indicates that "he mood of this ballad has never been more subtly captured."
Also of note on the track list is the song "Jaguar", described by "Guitar World" as Smith's "signature song". The book "Masters of Guitar" singles out the "up-tempo Smith original" as among the album's "many gems". Several other tracks were singled out in "The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon", by A. J. Millard, who theorized that Smith's playing style was influenced by his history as a trumpeter and his experiences in the NBC Studio Orchestra, which required extensive sight reading. According to Millard, in "Moonlight in Vermont" and "Tenderly", Smith's chord melodies resemble piano, while in "Sometimes I'm Happy" and "Tabú" the guitar becomes hornlike at midrange, with the electric guitar resembling a saxophone overall.
History.
Originally released on the Roost Records label, catalog RST-2211, the album has been subsequently reissued in an expanded CD form in 1994 by Roulette Records, who had acquired the Roost Collection in 1958. The expanded CD includes all of the tracks from the original album and incorporates most of the artist's recordings from that and the subsequent year, with the exception of three songs. One of the tracks, an alternative take on the Smith-penned "Jaguar", was previously unreleased.
Track listing.
"* Tracks 5, 8, 9, 11, 17, 18 and 19 were added for the CD reissue."

The story was serialised in instalments every weekday through The Scotsman newspaper. 
As Corduroy Mansions was released online, readers had the opportunity to interact with each other and the author himself through online discussion boards. This was edited by the Daily Telegraph staff.
The project is a collaboration between Telegraph Media Group, Little Brown and Polygon (the fiction imprint of Birlinn Ltd).
Plot.
The story is set in a fictional housing unit in London nicknamed Corduroy Mansions, and details the lives of the inhabitants of the large Pimlico house and others.
The main characters are Barbara Ragg, Basil Wickramsinghe, Berthea Snark, Caroline Jarvis, Dee Binder, Eddie French, Freddie de la Hay, Jenny Hedge, Jo Partlin, Marcia Light, Oedipus Snark, Terence Moongrove, and William French.

<doc id="19591232" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19591232" title="Mehdiana Sahib">
Mehdiana Sahib

Gurdwara Mehdiana Sahib, also called the 'School of Sikh History' is a Sikh Gurdwara located in the village of Mehdiana, just outside Manuke, near Jagraon in Ludhiana district, India.
Sikhs believe the site of the gurdwara to be where Guru Gobind Singh and his followers rested after the Battle of Chamkaur against the Imperial Mughal armies of Aurangzeb and where he was requested by his followers or the Sangat to write the Zafarnamah.
The gurdwara is known for its uniquely coloured architecture and monuments depicting important events in Sikh history. Additionally, the Dhaab (natural water reservoir), greenery, birds and trees made Mehdiana Sahib popular with pilgrims. Today parts of the Gurdwara have become dilapidated due to a lack of funds resulting from its isolated location and private ownership status
History.
Events.
In 1705 Mughal armies under Aurangzeb laid siege to Anandpur Sahib intent on reducing the influence of Gobind Singh and the Khalsa. During the siege Aurangzeb sent a signed letter to Gobind Singh offering safe passage out of Anandpur. Pressed by his followers and family he accepted and evacuated Anandpur on 20–21 December 1705.
Gobind Singh, his two eldest sons (Sahibzada Jujhar Singh and Sahibzada Ajit Singh) and thirty-eight followers arrived at Chamkaur, where they were granted shelter. Despite assurance from Aurangzeb of safe passage a contingent of the imperial army was sent to lay siege to the haveli. Vastly outnumbered Gobind Singh was disguised as another Sikh and escaped with only three others including Bhai Daya Singh and Bhai Dharam Das.
Gobind Singh reached Mehdiana after gathering support from across the Malwa region passing through the villages of Raikot, Lamme Jattpure & Manuke before finally reaching Mehdiana. The nearest habitation at the time was almost away so Gobind Singh and his followers rested by cleaned their teeth using tree twigs (Daatan) and bathed in the water (Daab). While Gobind Singh was meditating Bhai Daya Singh asked what they should do next. Gobind Singh's reply encouraged his followers to have faith in God’s will as they had done no wrong.
"Bhai Daya Singh I have returned the Debt and have become victorious. Singh and Tiger are kings of the same jungle. Singhs should keep faith in the Almighty."
Still distressed Bhai Daya Singh again repeated his requested, on behalf of all Sikhs (Sangat). Gobind Singh's reply showed that despite being Guru to the Sikhs Gobind Singh was only a mortal man and that in reality he was a servant to God and the Sangat. The quote refers to the execution Gobind Singh’s farther and proceeding Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur for opposing forced conversion to Islam of Kashmiris by Aurangzeb
"Sangat is bigger than Guru. Sent father to Delhi on Kashmiri Pandits plea. [Then On Sangat's request left Anandpur Sahib, [I left Chamkaur Garhi on Sangat's request, now you are asking me on Sangat's behalf."
Discussions about the future of the Sikhs continued until on Sangat's request Gobind Singh began to prepare his mind to begin writing the Zafarnamah. Gobind Singh went to the village Chakkar that night and the next day travelled to Deena Sahib to stay with Lakhmir and Shamir; after gathering support at the villages Takhtupura and Madhe. In Chakkar he wrote the Zafarnamah and sent it to Aurangzeb in Aurangabad with Bhai Daya Singh and Bhai Dharam Das.
For this reason pilgrims claim that Mehdiana Sahib has Gobind Singh’s blessing and that visiting will mean their prayers will not go unanswered.
Gurdwara Attraction.
Before late 1960s the Mehdiana complex looked like a forest with dense trees and bushes growing all around the place of worship. The gurdwara was not developed and maintained properly and there was no habitation within a distance of two to three miles (5 km). Later Jathedar Jora Singh Lakha took the responsibility for its development and made Mehdiana Sahib a popular destination for pilgrims. In 1972, when Lakha started the work, only a few acres were attached to the gurdwara but slowly the gurdwara complex covered .
In the vicinity of this gurdwara are the sculptures and statues of Sikh warriors who not only laid their lives for the sake of the religion but also endured torture at the hands of the Mughals. These statues depict soldiers, women and children being cut to pieces. Some sculptures show Bhai Kanhaiya, one of the soldiers of Guru Gobind Singh, serving water not only to the wounded soldiers in their own army but also to wounded enemy soldiers. Through these sculptures Lakha not only aimed to depict history but also to educate people that religion was more important than their lives. He felt it was better to sacrifice one's life than to accept injustice and cruelty and lose one's self-respect.
He has tried to show that the Sikh religion was born from the sacrifices of our ancestors and that religion should not be taken for granted. The importance of preserving one's self-respect and the triumph of good over evil have been beautifully depicted in the sculptures and paintings.
Gurdwara Complex.
The gurdwara is a fine specimen of Sikh architecture. Crores of rupees have been spent on its construction. Exquisite meenakari work can be seen here. On the door of the eighth floor of the building is engraved a picture of Bhai Gurdas who is dictating the bagtan di bani to the fifth guru. On the walls of the gurdwara are engraved images of Guru Gobind Singh's deeds along with his hymns and on the main door is shown Bhai Daya Singh Hura holding the horse of the Guru. Inside the main building of gurdwara a beautifully decorated Guru Granth Sahib is kept.
The gurdwara complex has its own Dasmesh Public School. Around 500 children from surrounding villages come in this school. To the right of the gurdwara building is a museum which houses beautiful paintings depicting the journey of Guru Gobind Singh from Patna to Anandpur Sahib. Near the main building of the gurdwara, is Baba Farid's asthan. This asthan looks like a small fort with a beautiful and realistic sculpture of Baba Farid and the pictures of different birds like crows, eagle etc. surrounding him. For the entertainment of children there is a mini zoo which houses rare animals. This zoo is in the form of a fort. There is also a modern sarovar and Langar is served 24 hours a day.

Robert Houle

Robert Houle (born 1947) is a Saulteaux First Nations artist, curator, critic, and educator. Houle has had an active curatorial and artistic practice since the mid-1970s. He played an important role in bridging the gap between contemporary First Nations artists and the broader Canadian art scene through his writing and involvement in early important high profile exhibitions such as "Land, Spirit, Power: First Nations" at the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa, 1992). As an artist, Houle has shown both nationally and internationally. He is predominately a painter working in the tradition of Abstraction, yet he has also embraced a pop sensibility by incorporating everyday images and text into his works.
Early life and education.
Houle was born in St. Boniface, Manitoba on 9 March 1947. He was raised in his traditional Saulteaux tribal culture and in the Roman Catholic religion. 
Houle earned his Bachelor of Arts in Art History from the University of Manitoba in 1972. After graduating, he augmented his art training by attending the Salzburg International Summer Academy focusing on painting and drawing. In 1975 he earned his Bachelor of Education degree in Art Education at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.
Artwork.
His paintings have been exhibited at the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, the Canadian Cultural Centre in Paris, and the Stedelijk Museum.
In Canada, he has shown work at the Mendel Art Gallery, the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, the Carleton University Art Gallery, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Tom Thomson Memorial Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Peterborough and the Winnipeg Art Gallery.
His artwork has been collected throughout Canada and in parts of the United States and Australia.
Career.
Robert Houle was Curator of Indian Art at the National Museum of Man in Ottawa from 1977 to 1980. He has been a visiting artist at Hood College, Gettysburg College, the Heard Museum, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection and the Winnipeg Art Gallery. For years, he taught as an instructor at the Ontario College of Art and Design, from which he is now retired. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

Night Electric Night

Night Electric Night is the third album by Swedish metal band Deathstars. It was released on January 30, 2009 by Nuclear Blast. The album was initially recorded under the working title "Deathglam". The album's first single, "Death Dies Hard", made its airplay debut on Stockholm, Sweden's Bandit Rock 106.3FM. Deathstars have now also put the song "Night Electric Night" on their Myspace page.
Recording.
The album was recorded mostly in a studio in Sweden; however, the album was also recorded in part in New York City. The band completed recording the album at New York in December 2008.
Album title.
Production of the third album by Deathstars was revealed in an interview with the band conducted by Anthony Morgan of Lucem Fero in early 2008, where it was referred to by its working title, "Deathglam". Vocalist Whiplasher Bernadotte expanded on the title, saying, ". . . it'll just continue with the deathglam that we play. In terms of this new album's style, I think it's more Deathstars than ever . . ."
Recently, the band has announced on their official website that the record has been re-dubbed "Night Electric Night". Whiplasher Bernadotte has stated that this is because calling the album "Deathglam" would be too "obvious".

Bovine enterovirus

Bovine enterovirus (BEV) is a picornavirus of the genus "Enterovirus". The virus may also be referred to as enteric cytopathic bovine orphan virus (ECBO). It is endemic in cattle populations worldwide and although normally fairly non-pathogenic it can cause reproductive, respiratory or enteric disease - particularly when the animal is concurrently infected with another pathogen.
The virus is spread horizontally by either the oral-fecal route or by the respiratory route. Viral shedding may occur for several months after initial infection. The virus has not been shown to transmit from animals to humans.
Virology.
Structure and genome.
In common with other picornaviruses, the capsid of BEV is composed of 60 copies of each of four structural proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4, in icosahedral symmetry, at about 27 nm in diameter, and enclosing a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 7,500 base pairs. The capsid is non-enveloped and roughly spherical with an outer radius of 159 Ångström and an inner radius of 107 Ångström. The outer surface of BEV is smoother than the closely related poliovirus due to the truncation of surface protein loops in BEV. It is also smoother than the related human rhinovirus due to the extension of a surface loop in BEV. The three antigenic sites of BEV all occur on a surface ridge at the junction between VP1, VP2 and VP3. BEV has a crater-like depression at the icosahedral 5-fold axis which descends into a cylindrical hole of 10 Ångström in diameter which runs almost to the inner surface of the capsid. A hydrophobic pocket contained within VP1 contains a myristic acid molecule, the removal of which appears to be a pre-requisite for virus uncoating.
Replication.
In order to replicate, BEV must attach to the host cell surface receptor, penetrate into the cell cytoplasm and the genome must be uncoated. The host cell surface receptor for BEV has yet to be identified but is sensitive to neuraminidase (1).
Genetic variability.
BEVs were originally classified into seven serotypes but are now accepted as falling into two serotypes, 1 and 2, which are further classified into subtypes. BEV strain VG-5-27 of serotype 1, subtype 1 is the most extensively studied. The tissue tropism of serotype 1 is extremely broad, including human, sheep, horse, dog, camel and other mammalian hosts. BEV-like sequences have even been reported in shellfish from water contaminated with bovine faeces. Serotype 2 viruses are only found in domestic cattle.
Signs and symptoms.
Most cattle show no clinical signs when infected with the virus. However abortion, stillbirth, infertility and neonatal mortality can occur following infection of the reproductive tract. Enteric signs include diarrhea and weight loss, and respiratory infection can produce a mucoid nasal discharge.
Diagnosis.
As clinical signs are fairly non-specific and bovine enterovirus is ubiquitous in cattle populations it necessary to rule out other causes of disease before diagnosing enterovirus as the cause of disease. Electron microscopy, PCR, complement fixation, antibody fluorescence, neutralization test and haemagglutination can be used to identify the virus in tissues or secretions.
Treatment and control.
Treatment is symptomatic. Appropriate isolation and hygiene measures should be employed to minimise the spread of disease during an outbreak.
Research.
The virus has been investigated for its anti-tumor capabilities, as it is capable of replicating within breast cancer cell lines and producing a cytopathic effect in human monocytes.

Richard Herst

Richard Herst (Hurst) (died 29 August 1628) was an English Roman Catholic recusant layman. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929.
Life.
Herst is thought to have been born at Broughton, near Preston, Lancashire, England, where he was a well-to-do yeoman, farming his own land. He was arrested while out ploughing his fields. As he was a recusant, Norcross, a pursuivant, was sent by the Bishop of Chester to arrest him. The pursuivants had a fracas with Hurst's servants, in the course of which one of the pursuivant's men, by name Dewhurst, in running over a ploughed field, fell and broke his leg. The wound mortified and proved fatal, and before his death Dewhurst made a solemn oath that his injury was the result of an accident. Nevertheless Hurst was indicted for murder, as the Government wished at that time to make severe examples of recusants.
Through Hurst's friends a petition was sent to King Charles I of England, also supported by Queen Henrietta Maria. No evidence contradicting the dying Dewhurst's having been adduced, the jury were unwilling to convict; but the foreman of the jury was told by the judge, in the house of the latter, that the Government was determined to get a conviction, that a murder had been committed, and that the jury must bring in a verdict of guilty. Hurst was convicted and sentenced to death; on the next day, being commanded to hear a sermon at the Anglican church, he refused and was dragged by the legs for some distance to the church, where he put his fingers in his ears so as not to hear the sermon.
At the gallows he was informed that his life would be spared if he would swear allegiance to the king, but as the oath contained passages to which he objected, he refused and was at once executed. He was executed at Lancaster.

PMNH Acquired a Huge Whale Shark landed at Karachi fish Harbor(2012). accourding to PMNH The Whale Shark was belong to Rhincodon typus and this family of fish is the one of the biggest in the world. It is a rare species and declared vulnerable by IUCN as its population is decreasing at an alarming rate. It is being commercially exploited as the fish has high value in international trade. It is called whale shark because it attains huge size like whales and also because its feeding habit resemble to whales. This distinctively marked fish is the only member of its genus and its family. This Whale Shark has a length of 42 feet and weighs 16 tonnes. Its liver weighed about 800 kg. Weight of stomach was about 600 kg, the ovary had a weight of 120 kg and had about 1500 eggs. The Whale Shark was seen on February 6, 2012 in the Gora Bari area in Pakistani territory of Arabian Sea by the local fishermen. According to them, it was alive at that time but motionless. It, however, died before they started hauling it towards sea shore. the Fish was brought to Karachi Fish Harbour on February 7, 2012 and auctioned for Rs. 200,000 The auctioneer who purchased the fish managed an exhibition of this specimen and levied a ticket of Rs. 20. The largest verified specimen of this huge shark was caught on 11 November 1947, near Baba Island, in Karachi, Pakistan. It was 41.50 ft long & that was more than 21.5 tonnes and had a girth (belt) of 23.0 ft.

<doc id="19591569" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19591569" title="Equal Access to Justice Act">
Equal Access to Justice Act

In the United States of America, the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) authorizes the payment of attorney's fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States absent a showing by the government that its position in the underlying litigation "was substantially justified." 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(1)(A). Section 2412(d)(1)(B) sets a deadline of 30 days after final judgment for the filing of a fee application and directs that the application include: (1) a showing that the applicant is a "prevailing party"; (2) a showing that the applicant is "eligible to receive an award"; and (3) a statement of "the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney ... stating the actual time expended and the rate" charged. Section 2412(d)(1)(B)'s second sentence further requires the applicant to "allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified." Scarborough v. Principi, 124 S. Ct. 1856 (2004).
On October 23, 2013, Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia formerly introduced a bill called "Innovation Act," which provides for fee shifting between private parties under the same standard used for awarding fees in the Equal Access to Justice Act. This bill was cosponsored by Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon. News reports suggest that this bill may be fast-tracked through Congress as it has wide bi-partisan support.
Time for filing.
An applicant for attorney's fees under the EAJA must file an application within thirty days of the final judgment in the civil action. 28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d) (1) (B). Scarborough, 124 S. Ct. 1856 (2004). However, an EAJA application may be filed until thirty days after a judgment becomes “not appealable.” 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412 (d) (1) (B) and (d) (2) (G). In some instances when an agency of the United States is a party in this case, a notice of appeal may be filed within 60 days of entry of the judgment. Fed. R. App. P. 4 (a) (1). Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292 (1993). See Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U.S. 89 (1991).
Net worth.
A party must meet the threshold requirement of having a net worth not in excess of $7,000,000 for any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization. Or, $2,000,000 at the time the action was filed for an individual. 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(2)(B)).
Substantial Justification and Special Circumstances.
The court must determine whether “the position of the United States was substantially justified or . . . special circumstances make an award unjust.” 28 U.S.C. §2412 (d) (1) (A). The government has the burden of proving its action is substantially justified or that circumstances make an award of attorney's fees unjust. Scarborough v. Principi, 124 S. Ct. 1856 (2004) citing Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 567 (1988); id., at 575 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Davidson v. Veneman, 317 F. 3d 503, 506 (CA5 2003); Lauer v. Barnhart, 321 F. 3d 762, 764 (CA8 2003); Libas, Ltd. v. United States, 314 F. 3d 1362, 1365 (CA Fed. 2003). See also H. R. Rep. No. 96-1005, at 10 ("strong deterrents to contesting Government action that currently exis[t require that the burden of proof rest with the
Government.").
In Pierce, the Supreme Court held that the position of the United States is substantially justified if it is “justified in substance or in the main--that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2550, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988). The Pierce Court provided further guidance on this standard, noting, ". . . position can be substantially justified even though it is not correct, and we believe that it can be substantially (i.e., for the most part) justified if a reasonable person could think it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact." Id. at 566 n.2, 108 S. Ct. at 2550 n.2.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has described the substantial justification standard as requiring that the government show that its position was grounded in "'(1) a reasonable basis in truth for the facts alleged; (2) a reasonable basis in law for the theory propounded; and (3) a reasonable connection between the facts alleged and the legal theory advanced.'" United States v. Hallmark Constr. Co., 200 F.3d 1076, 1080 (7th Cir. 2000) quoting Phil Smidt & Son, Inc. v. NLRB, 810 F.2d 638, 642 (7th Cir. 1987) quoting Donovan v. DialAmerica Mkting, Inc., 757 F.2d 1376, 1389 (3d Cir. 1985). Furthermore, some courts have held the “court only needs to find one reason for finding the ALJ was not substantially justified in order to allow EAJA fees . . .” Mallette v. Sullivan, 1990 WL 19894, *3-*5 (N.D. Il. 1990). 
Congress’s inclusion in the EAJA of the substantial justification standard manifests its intent not to permit a prevailing party to automatically recover fees. See Federal Election Commission v. Rose, 806 F.2d 1081, 1087 (D.C. Cir. 1986). As the Cummings court observed, these two standards of review “are used at different stages and involve different tests.” Cummings v. Sullivan, 950 F.2d 492, 498 (7th Cir. 1991). A court at the EAJA stage must take a fresh look at the case from an EAJA perspective, and reach a judgment independent from the ultimate merits decision. Rose, 806 F.2d at 1087-90. Thus, the government’s position may be substantially justified even if its decision was not supported by substantial evidence.
In Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552 (1988), the Supreme Court held that the government’s position is substantially justified if it is “justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person,” that is, “if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.” Id. at 565-66 & n.2. The Pierce Court rejected the position that substantial justification requires more than mere reasonableness. Id. 487 U.S. at 567-68. See also Brouwers v. Bowen, 823 F.2d 273, 275 (8th Cir. 1987) (“the substantial justification standard is a lesser standard than the substantial evidence standard used to review administrative determinations”) (citations omitted).
“Substantially justified” does not mean “justified to a high degree,” but rather has been said to be satisfied if there is a “genuine dispute,” or if reasonable people could differ as to the appropriateness of the contested action. Stein v. Sullivan, 966 F.2d 317, 320 (7th Cir. 1992) (citing Pierce, 487 U.S. at 565). Thus, a loss on the merits does not equate with a lack of substantial justification. See Pierce, 487 U.S. at 569 (“bviously, the fact that one other court agreed or disagreed with the Government does not establish whether its position was substantially justified. Conceivably, the Government could take a position that is not substantially justified, yet win; even more likely, it could take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose.”); United States v. Hallmark Construction Company, 200 F.3d 1076, 1080 (7th Cir. 2000). Thus, a court’s statement in its merits decision that a government agency did not have a “rational ground” for denying benefits does not imply a lack of substantial justification for the agency’s position. Kolman v. Shalala, 39 F.3d 173, 177 (7th Cir. 1994). As the Seventh Circuit explained in Kolman, its statement that the agency did not have a rational ground for its decision was a reference to the test for invalidating agency action; at the EAJA stage, the test is “whether the agency had a rational ground for thinking it had a rational ground for its action.” Kolman, 39 F.3d at 177.
Reasonableness of the Fee.
The applicant for EAJA fees has the burden of proving that the fees requested are reasonable. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983) (although Hensley dealt with attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the standards which it sets out are applicable generally to attorney's fee cases); Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 691-92 (1983).
Amount of Fees.
Attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125.00 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or other special factors justifies a higher fee. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) (2) (A). The movant bears the burden of producing satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate for the kind and quality of legal services rendered. Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 892 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1547 n. 11, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). Applicants for EAJA who claim and provide proof of inflation may be awarded attorney fees at an hourly fee in excess of $125.00 for work beginning after 1996 due to inflation. Failure to adjust the statutory cap for inflation might be considered an abuse of discretion. Sierra Club v. Secretary of the Army, 820 F.2d 513, 521 (1st Cir. 1987); Trichilo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 823 F.2d 702, 704-07 (2d Cir. 1987); Allen v. Otis Bowen, 821 F.2d 963 (3d Cir. 1987); Ramon-Sepulveda v. INS, 863 F.2d 1458 (9th Cir. 1988); and U.S. v. A Leasehold Interest in Property, 789 F.Supp. 1385, 1394 (E.D. Mich. 1992).
Costs.
Some costs may be compensated by the EAJA, including federal court filing fee. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412 (a) (1) and (a) (2), and (d) (2) (A).
Payment of Fees to Litigant and Payment of Government Debts.
In Astrue v. Ratliff, 130 S. Ct. 2521 (June 14, 2010) the Supreme Court unanimously held that an EAJA award is payable to the litigant, not his or her attorney, and is subject to offset to satisfy a pre-existing debt that the litigant owes to the United States.

Constitution of Cyprus

The Constitution of Cyprus is a document, ratified on August 16, 1960, that serves as the framework for the Cypriot government. It was drafted after the country won its independence in 1959.
The constitution put methods in place to protect Turkish Cypriots, due to the restrictions placed in Article 6 of the document. That article ensures the Cypriot government has no right to discriminate against either Turkish or Greek Cypriots. The constitution also ensures, in Article 1, that the Vice-President of the country is a Turk and the President is a Greek. In 1964, however, the Cypriot government became dominated by Greeks.
The constitution of the country collapsed, however, in 1963 due to dispute between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The running of the republic by the Greek community alone has been legally defined in what is called "Justice of need". Following the Turkish invasion of 1974 the state acts as a surrogate for the properties of Turkish Cypriots that moved to the Turkish occupied north. Following Cyprus's entry into the EU in 2004 and the Ibrahim Aziz vs. Republic of Cyprus case in the European court of human rights, some individual civil rights of Turkish Cypriots residing in the area under the control of the Republic have been restored, thus they can be part of the electoral register and stand in European elections. This however does not restored their communal rights as envisaged in the original constitution, i.e. separate electoral register to elect vice president and a fixed number of members of the house of representatives.
Constitutional breakdown.
In 1963, the Constitution broke down as the Turkish Cypriots involved withdrew from the government, and as a result the Greeks took full control of the government in 1965, as the Turkish Cypriots would not co-operate for constitutional changes, despite the constitutional safeguards to ensure representation of Turks that had previously existed.
The separation occurred because the two ethnic groups continued to distrust each other after the constitution was signed. Another issue that caused the breakdown was the fact that President Makarios III, a Greek Cypriot, supported complete integration between the two ethnic groups, while Vice President Fazil Küçük, a Turkish Cypriot, supported increased separation.
In addition, President Makarios proposed a constitutional change that year to remove most of the rights given to Turkish Cypriots. He said that the original constitution prevented the Turks and Greeks from "cooperating in the spirit of understanding and friendship," a position that was also accepted by the Turkish-Cypriot Vice-President.
Content.
General provisions.
The first five articles of the constitution discuss General Provisions.
Article One asserts that Cyprus is an independent republic with a President and that the President and Vice President must be Greeks and Turks respectively. Article three asserts that the official languages of the Republic of Cyprus are Greek and Turkish, and that all officials documents must be published in both languages.
Article four requires that Cyprus "shall have its own flag of neutral design and colour, chosen jointly by the President and the Vice-President of the Republic," while article five states that Greek and Turkish Cypriots have a right to celebrate their holiday's.
Fundamental rights and liberties.
Articles 6–35 of the constitution deal with Fundamental Rights and Liberties. 
Article six prohibits the discrimination of either Greek or Turkish Cypriots based on their race, while article seven asserts the right to life and states that an individual may only be deprived of his right to life except for when being sentenced by a "competent court" for an offense which provides the death penalty by law.
Article eight banks the issuing inhumane or degrading punishment, and prevents torture, and Article nine states that "every person has the right to a decent existence and to social security."
Article ten prohibits slavery and forced labour, in all cases other than in cases of compulsory military service or work while being imprisoned lawfully by the state. It also allows for "any service exacted in case of an emergency or calamity threatening the life or well-being of the inhabitants."
Article eleven contains several limits on who can be imprisoned. It states that people may only be imprisoned when they have been convicted by a court, detained to force them to appear before a court, detained to prevent them from committing an offense or detained to avoid the spread of diseases. The article also ensures that "every person who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation."
Article 12 ensures that Habeas Corpus is followed, that no person may be charged twice for the same offense, that the punishment is proportional to the crime, and that people have the right to a defence while in court.
Article thirteen says that any person has the right to move freely around Cyprus, and leave when they wish, subject to "reasonable conditions" imposed by law, while article fourteen states that no person shall be forced to leave the country.
Article fifteen defines the right to privacy. Is states that every individual has a right to a private life except when infringing on someone's privacy is in accordance of the law and in the national interest. Article sixteen prohibits entering someone's property without their prior consent without an arrest warrant, unless you are rescuing the individual from danger. Article seventeen also discusses privacy, with its main focus being an individual's right to privacy in all lawful communication.
Articles eighteen, nineteen and 21 secure freedom of speech, religion and assembly respectively, while twenty and 22 deal with the right to free education and marriage.
Article 23 adds to the rights laid out in article sixteen, by allowing citizens of Cyprus to purchase property and receive compensation for any damage to it.
Article 24 requires citizens to pay taxes. It states that "every person is bound to contribute according to his means towards the public burdens." It also states that no organization may collect a tax without permission in a court.
Article 25 ensures that every individual in Cyprus has the right to work, subject to conditions that may be in the law. Article 26 states that people may freely enter into contracts, and avoid be exploited by people with "commanding economic power."
Article 27 states that, subject to conditions in the law, citizens have a right to take part in industrial action. It also states that members of the armed forces, police and gendarmerie are not allowed to strike.

Ancient Diocese of Hamar

The former Norwegian Catholic diocese of Hamar existed from 1152 to the Protestant Reformation. The see was at Hamar, and the diocese included the ( modern ) counties of Hedmark ( except Solør, Odalen and the northern part of Østerdalen ), Oppland ( except Valdres ), and the middle part of Buskerud ( the modern municipalitites of Flesberg, Hole, Krødsherad, Modum, Nore og Uvdal, Ringerike, Rollag and Sigdal ). It also included some parts of Telemark ( the modern municipalitites of Hjartdal, Notodden, Seljord, Tinn and Vinje ).
History.
It was formed in 1152 out of the diocese of Oslo, when Arnold, Bishop of Gardar, Greenland ( 1124 – 1152 ), was appointed first Bishop of Hamar. He began to build the now ruined cathedral of Christ Church, which was completed about the time of Bishop Paul ( 1232 – 1252 ). 
Bishop Thorfinn ( 1278 – 1282 ) was exiled and died at Ter Doest in Flanders. Bishop Jörund (1285–86) was transferred to the archdiocese of Trondhjem. A provincial council was held in 1380. 
The last Catholic bishop, Mogens Lauritssøn ( 1513 – 1537 ), was taken prisoner in his castle at Hamar by Truid Ulfstand, a Danish noble, and sent to Antvorskov in Denmark, where he was held until his death in 1542. There were at Hamar a cathedral chapter with ten canons, a school, a Dominican Priory of St. Olaf, and a monastery of the Canons Regular of St. Anthony of Vienne.

Michelle de Bonneuil

Michelle Sentuary (7 March 1748, île Bourbon – 30 December 1829, Paris), married name Jean-Cyrille Guesnon de Bonneuil, was a French overseas agent during the French Revolution and First French Empire. Inspiring André Chénier and others, she was a lady "celebrated for her beauty and her agreeable spirit" according to the formula of Charles de Lacretelle himself a friend of Chénier. She stands for thousands of women in modern and contemporary historiography, and has had several biographies in biographical dictionaries. She was the mother of Amédée Despans-Cubières.
Life.
Creole origins.
Born in 1748 on Réunion, Michelle Sentuary was the younger daughter of Jean Sentuary and of Marie-Catherine Caillou. She was educated at Sainte-Suzanne, where her father had a plantation, and at Bordeaux, where in 1768 she married Jean-Cyrille Guesnon de Bonneuil, who had a post in the household of the comtesse d’Artois.
Paris society.
She then came to Paris where her beauty, charm, conversation and talents in singing and painting (Hubert Robert gave her painting lessons in the Sainte-Pélagie Prison and she exhibited her floral still lifes at the 1795 Salon) made herself famous in artistocratic and intellectual circles. Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, her painting-tutor and friend, called her "the most beautiful lady in Paris", and she had her portrait produced by the pastellist Rosalie Filleul, the painter Alexander Roslin (who portrayed her in "African" costume), the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne and many other artists.
A friend of poets, she belonged to the anacreontic circle at Marly known as "la Caserne", a strong institution freely inspired by Freemasonry. Its main hosts were three knight-poets - Évariste de Parny (author of erotic poetry), Antoine Bertin (who celebrated his sister Marie-Catherine under the name Eucharis) and Michel de Cubières. To finance new bribery within the princely household by her husband, Michelle de Bonneuil joined her sisters Marie-Catherine and Augustine-Françoise, Mmme Thilorier - the future Mme Jean-Jacques Duval d'Eprémesnil - as mistress to the rich financier Nicolas Beaujon, residing for some time at the hôtel d'Évreux. It was without doubt during this era of extreme dissipation that she met the Swiss banker Jean-Frédéric Perrégaux who she returned to at intervals until some time during the First Empire On his death, Nicolas Beaujon left her 100,000 livres that he had advanced her during his life. According to the painter John Trumbull on a trip to Paris, she moved in the highest spheres of French society and had come to be known as "comtesse de Bonneuil" - he wrote "de Bonouil" and was one of the most splendid ladies that he had never met.
A friend of Anne de Caumont-Laforce, comtesse de Balbi, who she courted at the Luxembourg Palace where her husband (elder than her) had become first valet to the count of Provence. Mme de Bonneuil there took admiral John Paul Jones as a temporary lover and a lasting liaison with the comte de Vaudreuil, as well as other liaisons with the baron de Bruny de La Tour d'Aygues (who dedicated to her an engraving of a flute-playing satyr), the scholar marquis de Cubières (landowner of the Ermitage on the rue de Maurepas at Versailles, with whom she had a son, Amédée-Louis Despans (taking the name Cubières from 1803 on his adoption by his natural father), comte Charles de Sartines (son of the minister, he offered her a carriage bearing her own arms for a tour of Longchamp - the shield was formed from an open eye surmounted by a count's crown, placed above a cornucopia, surrounded by foxes, of which one was apparently "éventré" -, the comte de Caylus (who pretended to initiate her into illuminism). She later met the abbot Augustin Barruel who made her "one of the ladies whom the searching sophists make their adepts, their females apostles". Abbot Raynal especially sought to insinuate that her daily dinners promoted atheism - their attendees replied "No, there is no God and it has to be said, and, as you repeat to others, in conversations, in circles, the truth must be known and become common". A free and adventurous spirit, Mme de Bonneuil was also initiated into the mysteries of Cagliostro and the rites of Egyptian Freemasonry, of which her brother-in-law Jean-Jacques Duval d'Eprémesnil was one of the masters. Her sister's two husbands - Jacques Thilorier and Jean-Jacques Duval d'Eprémesnil -both belonged to the Loge des Neuf Sœurs, and it is very possible that Mme de Bonneuil was herself initiated into one of the Loges d'adoption féminine, before turning her back on the new ideas and the principals of philosophy which - after the Reign of Terror - she sincerely thought had led to the "reign of the Jacobins". In dispatches she wrote from Spain, she alluded to the Jacobins, who she held responsible for the horrors of the Terror, having not only narrowly escaped the guillotine herself but also lost her sister, brother-in-law and many of her friends (including the poet André Chénier who celebrated her in his "Élégies" under the names "Camille" (anagram of "Micaëlle" or Michelle) or "d.z.n" (of "Sentuary d’Azan") to it.
French Revolution.
On the arrival of the Revolution, Mme de Bonneuil shared ultra-conservative views with Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès, her latest lover, and of Jean-Jacques Duval d'Eprémesnil, noble députés who sat with abbot Jean-Sifrein Maury on the extreme right of the semicircle of seats at the Constituent assembly. From 1791, she was implicated in counter-revolutionary projects, of which few were as badly executed as the royal family's planned escape with others from the hôtel d'Esclignac, which ended in the plotters' arrest on 18 April 1791. She was linked in friendship with the most famous of the counter-revolutionaries, such as Louis-Alexandre de Launay comte d’Antraigues who she pretended to take to Le Scioto, in the United States, with "only one of her hair".
Her rôle in the Jean-Charles Pichegru affair.
In spring 1802, profiting from the treaty of Amiens and the opening of England to French men and women (closed to them since 1797), Mme de Bonneuil left for London where the new French ambassador Otto saw her passport in July 1802. In September she reached Edinburgh, where she was received in a private audience by the hard-to-meet comte d'Artois, maybe in the presence of his confident the comte de Vaudreuil.

<doc id="19591831" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19591831" title="Thomas Newberry">
Thomas Newberry

Thomas Newberry (1811 – 16 January 1901) was an English Bible scholar and writer, most well known for his interlinear "Englishman's Bible", which compared the Authorised Version of the Bible with the Hebrew and Koine Greek of the original texts, first published in 1883 by Hodder and Stoughton, London.
Life.
Newberry was born into a Christian household in 1811 and little is known about his upbringing. Reportedly, through the witness of his older sister and mother, both believers, he was born again at a young age. He eventually came into fellowship with other Christians at the Plymouth Brethren assembly on Meadow Street, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, UK. He based his decision to join with the Brethren based on his studies of Scripture, and from 1840 had devoted himself to studying the Bible, not just in English but in its original languages of Hebrew and Greek. He found himself unable to agree with many of the practices and ordinances of the established churches of the day.
After years of serious study, Newberry published "The Englishman's Bible" (1886), his most famous legacy. He taught alongside Robert Chapman, Henry Dyer and George Muller, and contributed Bible teaching articles to "The Witness" and other Christian magazines, as well as conducting an extensive correspondence with Bible students across the world. Frederick Tatford tells us that Newberry was 'used by God in establishing an assembly in Nice, France, among many Italian-speaking residents in 1895'.
Works.
The Englishman's Bible.
In 1863, he was given a copy of Tischendorf's transcription of the New Testament according to the Codex Sinaiticus, in which he made copious handwritten notes, and two years later commenced work on "The Englishman's Study Bible", later more commonly known as the Newberry Study Bible. The finished work, with its unique use of signs and symbols to aid understanding of the tenses, and alternative translations, was much admired by the likes of William Kelly, FF Bruce and CH Raven.
Quotations.
"Thomas Newberry, the editor of The Newberry Study Bible, was born in 1811 and died in 1901. For most of his life he belonged to the Open wing of the Brethren movement. He resided for many years at Weston-super-Mare, England, and from there he exercised a long and fruitful expository ministry, both oral and written. He was a careful student of the Bible in Hebrew and Greek. Evidence of his minute attention to the sacred text lies before me as I write, in a beautiful copy of Tischendorf's transcription of the New Testament according to the Codex Sinaiticus, presented to him by friends in London in 1863, which is annotated throughout in his neat handwriting. It was after twenty-five years devoted to such study that he conceived the plan of putting its fruits at the disposal of his fellow-Christians in The Newberry Study Bible." - F.F. Bruce
"As the result of a careful examination of the entire Scriptures in the originals, noticing and marking where necessary every variation of tense, preposition, and the signification of words, the impression left upon my mind is this: not the difficulty of believing the entire inspiration of the Bible, but the impossibility of doubting it...The godliness of the translators, their reverence, the superiority of their scholarship, and the manifest assistance and control afforded to them by the Holy Spirit in their work, is such that the ordinary reader can rely upon the whole as the Word of God." - Thomas Newberry
"Newberry had no axe to grind. He was a careful and completely unpretentious student of Hebrew and Greek texts, whose one aim was to make the fruit of his study available as far as possible to Bible students whose only language was English. His procedure tended to make the Biblical text self-explanatory as far as possible; he had no thought of imposing on it an interpretive scheme of his own."- F.F. Bruce
"This slender quarto consists of eleven chapters, meant to illustrate and explain the value of his Englishman's Hebrew O.T., and Greek N.T., as far as can be for those who do not know the original tongues. The reader will find in the work not a few profitable hints conveyed in a clear and compact manner. Mr. N. is not a little attached to the Text. Rec. and the A.V., and indisposed to go with the Revisers in their admiration of their own work." - William Kelly on The Englishman's Bible

<doc id="19591835" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19591835" title="The Three Dead Kings">
The Three Dead Kings

The Three Dead Kings, also known by its Latin title De Tribus Regibus Mortuis or as The Three Living and the Three Dead, is a 15th-century Middle English poem. It is found in the manuscript MS. Douce 302, and its authorship is sometimes attributed to a Shropshire priest, John Audelay. It is an extremely rare survival from a late genre of alliterative verse, also significant as the only English poetic retelling of a well-known "memento mori" current in mediaeval European church art. 
Synopsis.
The theme of the 'Three Living and the Three Dead' is a relatively common form of "memento mori" in mediaeval art. A "Dit des trois morts et des trois vifs" by Baudoin de Condé has been traced back to 1280.
In the poem, an unnamed narrator describes seeing a boar hunt, a typical opening of the genre of the "chanson d'aventure". Three kings are following the hunt; they lose their way in mist and are separated from their retainers. Suddenly, "schokyn out of a schawe" (42) ('Starting out of a wood') three walking corpses appear, described in graphically hideous terms. The kings are terrified, but show a range of reactions to the three Dead, ranging from a desire to flee to a resolve to face them. The three corpses, in response, state that they are not demons, but the three kings' forefathers, and criticise their heirs for neglecting their memory and not saying masses for their souls: "Bot we haue made ȝoue mastyrs amys/ Þat now nyl not mynn us with a mas" (103-104). Once, the three Dead were materialistic and pleasure-loving: "Wyle I was mon apon mold merþis þai were myne" (121) ('While I was a man upon earth, pleasures were mine'), and they now suffer for it. Eventually, the Dead leave, the red daylight comes, and the kings ride home. The final message of the Dead is that the living should always be mindful of them - "Makis your merour be me" (120) - and of the transient nature of life. Afterwards the kings raise a church "with masse" (139) and have the story written on its walls.
Apart from its complex structure, the poem is distinguished for its vividly descriptive and imaginative language.
Poetic form.
Along with other poems in MS. Douce 302, "The Three Dead Kings" is written in a dialect of Middle English local to the area of Shropshire and west Staffordshire.
The poem has an extremely unusual structure, combining a four-stress alliterative line, a tight rhyme scheme, and regular use of assonance. The structure of the rhymes, "abababab" in the first eight lines of each stanza and "cdccd" in the final five, combines with the alliteration, and the use of the same final consonant on the fourth stress throughout the entire stanza, to produce an additional pararhyme between pairs of lines:
A few other Middle English poems use a similar thirteen-line stanza, but "The Three Dead Kings" has the most elaborate structure: medievalist Thorlac Turville-Petre refers to it as "the most highly patterned and technically complex poem in the language".
Authorship.
MS. Douce 302, now held at the Bodleian Library, is a manuscript of work by John Audelay, a chantry priest at Haughmond Abbey, Shropshire, who is known to have been alive in 1426, when the manuscript may have been compiled. By this point he stated that he was old, deaf, and blind, although this complicates the question of how he could have authored the poetry in the manuscript. Some scholars have argued that Audelay's other poetry lacks the great technical skill shown in "The Three Dead Kings", and that he is therefore unlikely to have written it, especially as it shows signs of a more northerly dialect. Others, however, have defended his authorship, noting that he favours both alliteration and thirteen-line stanza forms elsewhere in the manuscript.

Anthea Benton

Anthea Benton is a British television commercial and music video director, best known for her adverts for Stella Artois and Levi's. 
Benton began her career as a Fashion Designer, and moved into directing in 1982 as half of the directing duo Vaughan and Anthea (with Vaughan Arnell). The two worked together for over a decade, initially concentrating on music videos, making a number of memorable promos in the burgeoning field including Dead or Alive's "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)", Jamiroquai's "Space Cowboy", Take That's "Back for Good", Anggun's "Snow on the Sahara" and George Michael's "Fastlove" and "Spinning the Wheel". In 1992 the duo moved into commercials, creating Wrangler's DJ commercial, the first European advert to feature young black urban culture. The duo's commercials won a large number of awards, with Levi's "Creek" picking up two prestigious D&AD awards for Best Direction and Best Commercial. Their work for Stella Artois launched the brands distinctive style of honouring European cinema, with its nod to Jean de Florette. Their second advert for Stella "Les Nouvelles Chaussures" winning that year's D&AD award for Best Direction. 
Their work was defined by strong art direction, an awareness for fashion and an ability to set trends, especially in terms of the music used. For Levi's "Planet" the duo selected a little heard track called "Spaceman" by Babylon Zoo. The track was to go on to sell 418,000 copies in a week, a record at the time, propelling it to number one in the UK singles chart. 
In 1996 the duo decided to split, with both continuing to direct commercials and music videos. Anthea went on to direct commercials for brands including Sony, T-Mobile, Audi, Levi's, Peugot, Adidas, Hyundai and Barclaycard.
In 2004 Anthea Benton joined Believe Media. She continues to direct acclaimed work, recently working with actresses Anna Friel and Keeley Hawes in commercials for Pantene and Boots No7 respectively. Featured in "Shots" magazine's list of the top 100 creative people, Anthea is currently working on her first feature script.

Sara Delano Roosevelt Memorial House

Sara Delano Roosevelt Memorial House is a building that was built in 1908 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Neo-Georgian townhouse was designed by Charles A. Platt for Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt in 1907. It originally held "two mirror-image residences with a single facade and entrance. Each first floor had its own front reception room with a welcoming fireplace. Rear parlors could be combined through sliding doors." 
The house was used by Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt from its completion in 1908 to her death in 1941, and intermittently by Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt from construction to their sale of the house to Hunter College in 1943. After his mother's death in 1941, President Roosevelt and his wife placed the house up for sale and a non-profit consortium was organized to purchase the house on behalf of Hunter College. 
The house was closed in 1992 and reopened in 2010 after an $18 million renovation. The building is currently used by Hunter College as the "Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College" or, simply, "Roosevelt House".

North Carolina Highway 344

NC 344 is a north–south state highway in coastal North Carolina; it is entirely in Pasquotank County.
Route description.
The highway's southern terminus lies at the shores of the Pasquotank River near its mouth with the Albemarle Sound. NC 344 winds northwestward through rural Pasquotank County and the unincorporated community of Weeksville as the two-lane Salem Church and Weeksville Roads, becoming a four-lane with center turning lane thoroughfare at the main gate of Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City southeast of Elizabeth City.
NC 344 continues along for another 1.41 miles before entering the city limits of Elizabeth City at the southeastern corner of the Elizabeth City State University campus. Continuing to the southwestern corner of the Elizabeth City State University campus at its intersection with Herrington Avenue, NC 344 drops its designation of Weeksville Road, becoming Halstead Boulevard for the duration of its existence. 
NC 344 continues on for another 5.2 miles as a major commercial corridor along Elizabeth City's southern border, having major intersections at US 17 Business (Ehringhaus Street) and mainline US 17 (Hughes Boulevard/ "former US 17 Bypass"). Continuing past mainline US 17 as the limited-access thoroughfare Halstead Boulevard Extended, NC 344 travels through the heart of an emerging retail corridor in western Elizabeth City before terminating at its junction with US 17 Bypass.
History.
Weeksville Road, Herrington Avenue, Road and Water Streets through Elizabeth City, carried the designation of NC 170 from the 1950s, followed by NC 168 from 1958 to 1979, then most recently NC 34 before its conversion to NC 344 in 2006. 
All three highways continued their route east of Elizabeth City, multiplexing with US 158 through Camden county until Belcross, with NC 170 and NC 168 continuing past Sligo, NC to the Virginia border. The creation of NC 34 in 1979 ran from the Pasquotank River to Sligo, with NC 168 running from the Virginia border to Barco, NC in Currituck County. 
The previously unsigned Halstead Boulevard had become a major commercial corridor along the south side of Elizabeth City starting in the early 1990s. In 2006, NC 34 was truncated to the eastern third of its route from Belcross in Camden County to Sligo in Currituck County, leaving NC 344 to sign Weeksville Road and Halstead Boulevard to its new terminus with US 17 Bypass.

Foul (sports)

In sports, a foul is an inappropriate or unfair act by a player as deemed by a referee. A foul may be intentional or accidental, and often results in a penalty.
Individual sports may have different types of fouls. For example, in basketball, a personal foul involves illegal personal contact with an opponent. A technical foul refers to unsportsmanlike non-contact behavior, a more serious infraction than a personal foul. A flagrant foul involves unsportsmanlike contact behavior, considered the most serious foul and often resulting in ejection from the game.
In association football, a foul is an unfair act by a player as deemed by the referee. In association football or rugby, a professional foul is a deliberate act of foul play, usually to prevent an opponent scoring.
Kinjite are various fouls that a sumo wrestler might commit that will cause him to lose the bout.
Facial is a term used in some contact sports to refer to a foul that involves one player hitting another in the face.

<doc id="19591977" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19591977" title="Organic user interface">
Organic user interface

In human-computer interaction, an organic user interface (OUI) is defined as a user interface with a non-flat display. After Engelbart and Sutherland's Graphical User Interface (GUI), which is based on the cathode ray tube (CRT), and Kay and Weiser's Ubiquitous Computing, which is based on the flat panel liquid-crystal display (LCD), OUI represents the third wave of display interaction paradigms, pertaining to multi-shaped and flexible displays. In an OUI, the display surface is always the locus of interaction, and may actively or passively change shape upon analog (i.e., as close to non-quantized as possible) inputs. These inputs are provided through direct physical gestures, rather than through indirect point-and-click control. Note that the term "Organic" in OUI was derived from organic architecture, referring to the adoption of natural form to design a better fit with human ecology. The term also alludes to the use of organic electronics for this purpose.
Organic user interfaces were first introduced in a special issue of the "Communications of the ACM" in 2008. The first International Workshop on Organic User Interfaces took place at CHI 2009 in Boston, Massachusetts. The second workshop took place at TEI 2011 in Madeira, Portugal. The third workshop was held at MobileHCI 2012 in Monterey, California, and the fourth workshop at CHI 2013 in Paris, France.
Types of organic user interface.
According to Vertegaal and Poupyrev, there are 3 general types of Organic User Interface:
Flexible (or deformable) user interfaces: When flexible displays are deployed, shape deformation, e.g., through bends, is a key form of input for OUI. Flexible display technologies include Flexible OLED (FOLED) and Flexible E Ink, or can be simulated through 3D active projection mapping.
Shaped user interfaces: Displays with a static non-flat display. The physical shape is chosen so as to better support the main function of the interface. Shapes may include spheres, cylinders or take the form of everyday objects.
Actuated (or kinetic) user interfaces: Displays with a programmable shape controlled by a computer algorithm. Here, display shapes can actively adapt to the physical context of the user, the form of the data, or the function of the interface. An extreme example is that of Claytronics: fully physical 3D voxels that dynamically constitute physical 3D images.
Organic design principles.
Holman and Vertegaal present three design principles that underly OUI:
Input equals output: In traditional GUIs, input and output are physically separated: Output is generated graphically on the screen on the basis of input provided by a control device such as a mouse. A key feature of OUI is that the display surface, and its physical deformations are always the locus of user interaction.
Function equals form: Coined by Frank Lloyd Wright, this means the shape of an interface determines its physical functionality, and vice versa. Shapes should be chosen such that they best support the functionality of the interface. An example is a spherical multitouch interface, which is particularly suited to geographic information interfaces, which were previously limited to distorted flat projections of spherical earth data.
Form follows flow: OUIs physically adapt to the context of a user's multiple activities, e.g., by taking on multiple shapes. An example of this is the "clamshell" phone, where the physical metaphor of altering the phone's shape (by opening it) alters the state of the user interface (to open communications). Another example is folding a thin-film tablet PC into a smaller, pocket-sized smartphone for mobility.
Example implementations.
Early examples of OUIs include Gummi, a rigid prototype of a flexible credit card display, PaperWindows, featuring active projection-mapped pieces of paper, the Microsoft Sphere, one of the first spherical multitouch computers, and DisplayObjects (rigid objects with displays wrapped around them). PaperPhone was one of the first OUIs to introduce bend gestures on a real flexible screen. It featured a flexible electrophoretic display and an array of 5 bend sensors that allowed for user navigation of content. Examples of actuated OUIs include shape changing prototypes like MorePhone and Morphees. The Nokia Kinetic, a flexible smartphone that allows input techniques such as bend, twist and squeeze, and the Samsung Youm, are early commercial prototypes of OUIs. It is widely expected that OUIs will be introduced on the market by the year 2018.
Note that OUIs differ from a natural user interface (NUI) in that NUIs are limited to touch or remote gestural interactions with a flat display only. Although remote gestural interaction violates the principle of "Input Equals Output", OUIs generally subsume NUIs. Also note that OUI is a successor to and form of Tangible User Interface that always features a bitmapped display skin around its multi-shaped body. Finally, note that all OUIs are examples of haptic technologies, as their physical shapes, like real objects, provide passive tactile-kinaesthetic feedback even in non-actuated cases.

Clash of the Titans (tour)

Clash of the Titans was the name of a worldwide tour by several popular American thrash metal bands of the 1980s, with alternating headliners from show to show.
History.
The tour began in 1990 with a European leg featuring Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Suicidal Tendencies. A second leg in 1991 in the United States and Canada with a slightly different lineup; this time with headliners Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, and supporting act Alice in Chains. According to the documentary "Get Thrashed", the Bay Area thrashers Death Angel were supposed to be the supporting act, but after an accident which almost took drummer Andy Galeon's life, the band was forced to decline the offer.
On November 16, 2009, it was announced that the European Clash of the Titans lineup would be reunited after 19 years on the American Carnage Tour featuring Megadeth, Slayer and Testament. On July 13, 2010, a second leg of the American Carnage Tour was announced that would feature the American Clash of the Titans lineup: Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax. Unlike the Clash of the Titans tour, Suicidal Tendencies or Alice in Chains did not play on either lineup.

Vilmos Sipos

Vilmos Sipos, also known as Vilim Šipoš and Willy Sipos (24 January 1914 – 1978) was a Hungarian football player and manager. He played for several important clubs in a number of countries, having represented at national level both Yugoslavia and Hungary.
Career.
Born in Wilhelmsburg, Austria, ethnically Hungarian, he begin playing with SK Građanski Sremska Mitrovica a local club in the town where he was living since young, in Vojvodina, still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire back then. There he was spotted by Yugoslav SK Jugoslavija that offered him to move to Belgrade in 1930. After one season he moved to their Yugoslav First League main rivals at that time, Zagreb's HŠK Građanski where he will play until 1934. By 1934 his skills convinced the Yugoslav Football Association to offer him to play for the Yugoslav national team, having debuted on 18 March 1934 in a match against Bulgaria, a 2-1 win.
Having represented two of the most notable clubs in Yugoslavia and having become national team player, foreign interest grow, and in summer 1934 he moved to Swiss BSC Young Boys where he will play two seasons until 1936. That year he moved to one of the most prominent French clubs from that period, FC Sète. In the Ligue 1 he will play a total of 15 matches having scored twice. In this period he became a regular in the Yugoslav national team. In 1938 Zagreb's HŠK Građanski, with the financial effort of their vice-president Gustav Maceljski, who paid 100.000 Francs to Sète, brought him back, but after one season they sold him to FC Rapid Bucureşti. On 7 May 1939, he played his last match for the Yugoslav national team, against Romania, in a 0-1 defeat.
By the beginning of the Second World War and the occupation of Yugoslavia, Sipos was playing in Romania. During this period he won 3 consecutive Romanian Cups, in 1940, 1941 and 1942. Interest on him grew again, and he moved to Hungarian Ferencváros in 1942. The club had been Hungarian league champions in 1940 and 1941, but Sipos will have to wait until 1944 to win the national title. Being an ethnic Hungarian, and with Yugoslavia occupied, not competing, and with an uncertain future by then, Sipos was invited to play for the Hungarian national team making his debut in 1945.
At the end of the war in 1945 and with Hungary becoming a communist country, Ferencváros finished in a disappointing 5th place in 1946. Sipos decided to move abroad, and in summer 1946 he accepted an offer from Italian Bologna FC, coached by the Hungarian József Viola. The club had dominated the Serie A by the late 1930s winning 4 titles between 1935 and 1941, but that season, 1946–47 Bologna finished 5th. Sipos left next summer, but stayed in Italy where he will play with several clubs such as Correggio, Grosseto and Arsenale Messina. Before retiring he played one season in French Algeria with FC Jeunesse Oran where he was simultaneously the main coach and player.
After Algeria he moved to France where he kept playing exhibition matches until 1952 with IRO Hungaria, a team formed by Hungarian immigrants. Because many data from this period is lost or unavailable, it is believed that his career data is still incomplete. After retiring from football he moved to Paris where he lived until his death in 1978.
National team.
Being considered one of the first professional players in Yugoslav football, he played a total of 13 matches for the Yugoslav national team between 1934 and 1939, having scored once, the only goal in the defeat against Czechoslovakia by 1-3, played on 28 May 1938.
Beside the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Sipos played two matches for the Hungarian national team. The first was in Budapest against Romania in 1945, a smashing 7-2 win, where Sipos played in the attack alongside Nándor Hidegkuti, Gyula Zsengellér, Ferenc Puskás and István Nyers, and the second was in Vienna in 1946 against Austria, in a 2-3 defeat, with Sipos playing as right winger.

Józef Różański

Józef Różański (; b. Josek Goldberg; Warsaw, 13 July 1907 – 21 August 1981, Warsaw) was a Jewish communist in prewar Second Polish Republic, member of the Soviet NKVD and later, colonel of the Stalinist Ministry of Public Security of Poland. Born into a Jewish family in Warsaw, Różański became active in the Communist Party of Poland before World War II. He joined NKVD following the Soviet invasion of Poland and after the war, adopting the name Różański, served as interrogator with the Polish communist security apparatus (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa). 
Różański was personally involved in torturing and maiming dozens of opponents of the Polish puppet government; including anti-communist activists, as well as other, more moderate communists, and Cursed soldiers. He gained notoriety as one of the most brutal secret police interrogators in Warsaw. Różański personally administered torture to Witold Pilecki, one of the Righteous Among Nations. Pilecki revealed no sensitive information and was executed on May 25, 1948 at Mokotów Prison by Sergeant Smietanski, the "Butcher". 
Józef Różański was arrested in 1953 – at the end of the Stalinist period in Poland – and charged with torturing innocent prisoners including Polish United Workers' Party members. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison on 23 December 1955. In July 1956 the Supreme Court reopened his case due to improprieties discovered in the original investigation. On 11 November 1957 (charged along with co-defendant Anatol Fejgin) he was again sentenced by the lower court this time to 15 years in prison. He was released in 1964, having served seven years. Różański died of cancer on 21 August 1981, and was buried at the Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw.
Różański was a brother of Jerzy Borejsza.

USS Zita (SP-21)

USS "Zita" (SP-21) was a motorboat that the United States Navy assigned to service as a patrol vessel in 1917 during World War I.
"Zita" was a wooden-hulled motorboat built in 1916 at Brooklyn, New York, by Charles Johnson.
H. E. Boucher, of Brooklyn, owned "Zita" in 1917 at the time of her inspection by the U.S. Navy in the 3rd Naval District.
Records concerning "Zita" are sparse, but they show that the Navy gave the classification SP-21 to the boat and assigned her to district patrol duties in the 3rd Naval District.
Extant records do not reveal either the length or the character of her service nor do they tell whether or not "Zita" was ever officially commissioned.

William Oliver Reese

William Oliver Reese was a US Navy airman who, on January 3, 2006 murdered 56 year old Japanese woman Yoshie Sato in Yokosuka, Japan. He later confessed to the crime. Reese is currently serving life in prison in Japan. Reese was stationed on the USS "Kitty Hawk" (CV-63).
Details of the crime.
On January 3, William Oliver Reese was near the Yokosuka-Chūō train station when he accosted 56-year-old Yoshie Sato, demanding money. Reese was intoxicated at the time. At first, he asked her for directions to the nearby naval base, and after she pointed it out to him, he attempted to take her purse. When Sato began yelling for help, Reese dragged her to a nearby stairwell and proceeded to beat her for 11 minutes. Sato later died of a ruptured kidney. He then removed 15,000 yen from her purse and left the scene. Some accounts claim that Reese was apprehended by US Navy sentries at the main gate to Yokosuka Naval Base, who became suspicious when they noticed Reese's bloodstained clothes; other accounts state that he was actually caught aboard the USS KITTY HAWK CV-63 as he attempted to return to work. He would later claim that he had no idea why he killed her.
http://www.usp.com.au/fpss/img-prisoners/WilliamReese02.jpg
International repercussions.
When Reese was indicted and subsequently convicted after making a full confession there were many calls for a Status of Forces Agreement revision. Severe liberty restrictions were also enacted by the US Navy upon its sailors stationed in the region. The restrictions applied to all sailors and included such measures as curfews and detailed "liberty plans" (written statements of a sailor's exact whereabouts throughout the day).

2001 Winchester 400

The thirty-second annual Winchester 400 motor race (run yearly since 1970) was held under American Speed Association sanction on September 23, 2001, at the Winchester Speedway, Indiana (USA).
In a race similar to many of the previous 31 showdowns, the Winchester 400 came down to just the final laps, as Joey Clanton held off three-time Winchester 400 winner Mike Cope in a dramatic showdown to take his third win of the 2001 season. For Clanton, racing with Cope was the perfect thing to turn around his season, as the two had had several run-ins over the season.
The race.
"Mike (Cope) really knows how to get around this place," said Clanton, who collected his fourth career ASA win and moved himself into third in the points. "I knew I couldn't lift or he would be around me. You really have to stay focused on getting around the middle of the corners."
Clanton took the lead on lap 332 when pole sitter David Stremme, who dominated much of the race, missed a shift coming to the green flag. Clanton held onto the point until late in the race, when Cope closed within one car length. Cope made several attempts to get by Clanton late in the race, but to no avail.
"We did some rubbing toward the end," said Clanton. "I knew he wouldn't have wrecked me toward the end. To win at Winchester is really special. It is one of the toughest short track races there is."
Cope, who was involved in several incidents during the afternoon, led the most laps, but ended up with his second career runner up finish, his first coming in Nashville earlier this season.
"I was waiting for him to slip," said Cope. "He did once, but I wasn't in a position to take it from him. We had our share of stuff in the past, but it was nice to race him clean for the win."
The race was a typical Winchester 400, as the afternoon took its toll on the field. One of the pre-race favorites, Mike Miller, was taken out of the event in a first lap accident that also involved Indianapolis' Tim Taylor. National Championship points leader Johnny Sauter had a bad afternoon, as he was involved in an accident early and finished 12th, 19 laps off the pace. Only three cars, including third-place Mike Garvey, finished on the lead lap, and only 17 of the 32 starters were running at the end.

Highland Heights-Stevens' Subdivision Historic District

Highland Heights-Stevens' Subdivision Historic District is a residential historic district located in Highland Park, Michigan along five east-west streets: Farrand Park, McLean Street, Colorado Street, Rhode Island Street, and Massachusetts Street, between Woodward Avenue on the west and Oakland Avenue on the east. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
Significance.
The structures in the neighborhood are primarily single-family homes built in the early twentieth-century. The area features an unusually high concentration of high quality, middle class housing stock, built over a short period of time, with much of it still well-preserved.
Description.
The Highland Heights-Stevens' Subdivision Historic District is a neighborhood of primarily single-family detached homes. There are 422 single-family homes, two apartment buildings, five commercial buildings, and the McGregor Library located within the district. Of these, 392 single-family houses, both two apartment buildings, and the library are classified as contributing to the district's historic character.
The houses are fine representation of the variety of American residential architecture in the years 1900-1930. Styles represented include foursquares, bungalows, and various revival styles. There are also 393 garages in the district, located along back alleys. Of these, 373 appear to have been constructed in the years of the area's initial development, and their presence and construction reflects the upwardly mobile, middle-class character of the neighborhood.

Some Girls (film)

Some Girls is a 1988 film starring Patrick Dempsey and Jennifer Connelly.
Synopsis.
Michael, a college student, (Patrick Dempsey) goes to Quebec City, Canada for Christmas at the request of his college girlfriend Gabriella (Jennifer Connelly), after months of her stonewalling him after she left college in mid-semester. 
Michael starts the vacation full of hope and youthful enthusiasm because she has invited him to stay with her family. He arrives and is left waiting at the airport for hours. Gabriella (he calls her Gabi) eventually arrives to pick him up and explains that sometimes they just don't answer their phone. He brushes off his frustration because he's happy to see her.
When Michael arrives at the house and meets Gabi's family, he finds them rather eccentric. Her father (Andre Gregory) is wearing only a towel, but will spend much of the rest of the film in the buff. He eventually explains that he is writing a treatise on the philosopher Blaise Pascal and that he cannot write while dressed. The mother (Florinda Bolkan) is fiercely religious and a very strong yet quiet woman. A Catholic priest named Father Walter (Jean-Louis Millette) is also present, apparently a close—even uncomfortably close—friend of the family. Michael also meets Gabi's two energetic, beautiful, coquettish sisters Irenka (Sheila Kelley and Simone (Ashley Greenfield), along with a handsome young handyman named Nick (Lance Edwards) who is romantically involved with Irenka. 
Although Michael enthusiastically attempts to join in the unusual habits of the family (an example is the apparent tradition of growling at one's dinner plate before eating) he quickly learns that fitting in will be a challenge. The situation is complicated by the illness of Gabi's grandmother, the matriarch of the family, and the reason why Gabi left school in the first place. Almost immediately, Michael commits the apparently unforgivable gaffe of expressing his condolences to Gabi's mother. Things go downhill for Michael from there. As soon as they have time alone, Gabi announces that she no longer loves him. His attempts to change her mind seem somewhat successful, but the fickle female spirit continues to thwart him. In the meantime, he is seductively teased first by Irenka, then by Simone, and possibly even by her mother, all with the Gabi's apparent complicity. At one point, Gabi appears to have a change of heart toward Michael, but then again decides that she doesn’t love him.
Gabi's grandmother (Lila Kedrova), whom we know only as "Granny," is in a care facility apparently suffering from senile dementia. Upon meeting Michael, she acts as if he is her long-dead husband, who was also named Michael. In an attempt to find her husband, she escapes from the hospital and goes to the country estate which they shared when they were first married. The girls, Nick, and Michael frantically rush to the estate, hoping Granny hasn't frozen in the cold of winter. During their search, Michael gets lost in the woods and falls into a hole, unable to get out. He hears footsteps and finds it is Granny. Apparently, she helps him out and they go back to the house together where Michael lights a fire and gets Granny out of her wet clothes. She then proceeds to talk to him as if he were her husband, and they form an unexpected bond.
Granny falls ill on the return trip, and despite Nick's valiant attempt to reach a hospital in time, she dies. After the funeral, and a tryst with Irenka, Michael makes a solitary visit to her grave-site where he encounters a mysterious young woman and confesses to her that he deeply loved Granny. Later he recognizes the young woman from a photograph as Granny in her youth, and realizes their meeting may have been supernatural. Ultimately, he returns home and we are left to assume that he never sees Gabi or her family again, as she has decided not to return to college. But Michael does not seem disappointed at the end of their relationship; instead he is deeply touched by his unexpected spiritual bond with her grandmother.

Verbrüderungsbuch (codex of fraternisation) is the German name for registers from monasteries in the Middle Ages. They contained lists with the names of sponsors and benefactors, as well as persons in close spiritual contact with a monastery, so that they were actively remembered in the prayers of the monks. In many cases these books were established as early as the 8th century and continued up to the 13th century. So-called "Jahrtagsbücher" (year books) are in many ways their successors.

IFE matrix

IFE matrix means Internal Factor Evaluation Matrix; is a popular strategic management tool for auditing or evaluating major internal strengths and internal weaknesses in functional areas of an organization or a business. 
IFE matrix also provides a basis for identifying or evaluating relationships among those areas. The IFE matrix is used in strategy formulation.
The IFE Matrix together with the EFE matrix is a strategy-formulation tool that can be used to evaluate how an organization or a company is performing in regards to identified internal strengths and weaknesses of an organization or a company. The IFE matrix method conceptually relates to the Balanced Scorecard method in some aspects.
The IFE matrix comprises factors (strengths and weaknesses), weight (0.0 to 1.0), rating (0.0 to 4.00) and finally the weighted score after multiplying weight with rating.
The establishment of the IFE matrix.
IFE matrix can be according to the following five steps to establish:(1) a list of key factors analysis of the process to determine the inside. Using 10~20 internal factors, including two aspects strengths and weaknesses. Firstly, then list the weakness.

<doc id="19592340" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19592340" title="Management of chronic headaches">
Management of chronic headaches

Chronic headache, or "chronic daily headache (CDH)", is classified as experiencing fifteen or more days with a headache per month. It is estimated that chronic headaches affect "4% to 5% of the general population". Chronic headaches consist of different sub-groups, primarily categorized as chronic tension-type headaches and chronic migraine headaches. The treatments for chronic headache are vast and varied. Medicinal and non-medicinal methods exist to help patients cope with chronic headache, because chronic headaches cannot be cured. Whether pharmacological or not, treatment plans are often created on an individual basis. Multiple sources recommend "multimodal treatment", which is a combination of medicinal and non-medicinal remedies. Some treatments are controversial and are still being tested for effectiveness. Suggested treatments for chronic headaches include medication, physical therapy, acupuncture, relaxation training, and biofeedback. In addition, dietary alteration and behavioral therapy or psychological therapy are other possible treatments for chronic headaches.
Treatments.
Medicinal treatments.
Analgesic and abortive medications.
The most common chronic treatment method is the use of medicine. Many people try to seek pain relief from analgesic medicines (commonly termed pain killers), such as aspirin, acetaminophen, aspirin compounds, ibuprofen, and narcotics. Also, abortive medications can be used to "stop a headache once it has begun"; such drugs include ergotamine (Cafergot), triptans (Imitrex), and prednisone (Deltasone). However, medical professionals advise that abuse of analgesics and abortive medications can actually lead to an increase in headaches. The painkiller medicines help headaches temporarily, but as the "quick fix" wears off, headaches become more re-current and grow in intensity. These "rebound headaches" can actually make the body less responsive to preventive medication. Therefore, analgesic and abortive medications are often advised for headaches that are not chronic in nature.
Prophylactic (preventative) medications.
The most common medicines used to treat chronic (daily) headaches are called prophylactic medicines, which are used to prevent headaches. Such preventative medication is taken on a daily basis, even when a person may not have a headache. Prophylactic medicines are recommended for chronic headache patients because varied experiments prove that the medications "reduce the frequency, severity, and disability associated with daily headaches". A majority of the prophylactic medications work by inhibiting or increasing neurotransmissions in the brain, often preventing the brain from interpreting pain signals.
Preventative medicines include gabapentin (Neurontin), tizanidine (Zanaflex), fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and topiramate (Topamax). In testing, gabapentin was found to reduce the number of headache days a month by 9.1%. Tizanidine was found to decrease the average frequency of headaches per week, the headache intensity, and the mean headache duration. Through studies, Fluoxetine resulted in better mood ratings and "significant increases in headache-free days". Despite being associated with depression, antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been found to effectively treat "near-daily headaches" and numerous chronic pain conditions as well as improving mood and sleep—two possible triggers for chronic headache sufferers. One study found that the headache frequency over a 28-day period lowered for chronic headache patients on topiramate. Another medication to prevent headaches is botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA or BOTOX), which is given by injection instead of being taken orally. In a clinical study of botulinum toxin type A, patients participating in the 9-month treatment period with three treatments experienced headache frequency decreases up to 50%. As with all medications, the preventative medications may have side effects. Since different people respond to drugs differently, chronic headache sufferers may have to go through a "trial-and-error" period to find the right medications. The previously mentioned medicines can improve headaches, but physicians recommend multiple forms of treatments.
Non-medicinal treatments.
Physical therapy.
In addition to medicines, physical therapy is a treatment to help improve chronic headaches. In physical therapy, a patient works together with a therapist to help identify and change physical habits or conditions that affect chronic headaches. Physical therapy for chronic daily headaches focuses on the upper body, including the upper back, neck, and face. Therapists assess and improve the patient's body posture, which can aggravate headaches. During office sessions, therapists use manual therapy, such as a massage, stretching, or joint movement to release muscle tension. Other methods to relax muscles include heat packs, ice packs, and "electrical stimulation". Therapists also teach chronic headache sufferers at-home exercises to strengthen and stretch muscles that may be triggering headaches. In physical therapy, the patient must take an active role to practice exercises and make changes to his or her lifestyle for there to be improvement.
Acupuncture.
Another non-medicinal treatment, which does not require at-home exercises, is acupuncture. Acupuncture involves a certified acupuncturist picking particular points on the body to insert acupuncture needles; these points may differ on an individual basis. With chronic headache patients, the acupuncturist may needle "tender points at or near the site of maximal headache pain". A study conducted by the University of North Carolina School of Medicine found that compared to medicinal treatment alone, medicinal treatment plus acupuncture resulted in more improvement for chronic daily headache patients. Another acupuncture study in Germany found that 52.6% of patients reported a decrease in headache frequency In both studies, acupuncture was not the only treatment. Trials show that acupuncture can cause "relevant improvements" for people with chronic headaches.
Relaxation training.
Relaxation training is another form of non-pharmacological treatment for chronic headache. Relaxation training helps to reduce internal tension, allowing a person to control headaches triggered by stress. The different relaxation methods are normally taught by a psychologist or a therapist. Relaxation training works as people become in tune with their own body, allowing them to realize when it is necessary to decrease tension before a headache occurs. The point of relaxation training is to teach people "an attitude of consciously setting out to relax but not trying too hard", enabling people to relax in everyday situations. Relaxation training includes two different types of methods: physical and mental.
Physical methods.
Physical relaxation methods involve actual body movement or action. One physical method for releasing tension involves "purposefully tensing and then relaxing groups of muscles in a definite sequence", which is named accordingly progressive muscle relaxation. Another physical method of relaxation is deep breathing. Deep breathing is done by breathing from the bottom of the lungs up, which is characterized by the rise and fall of the stomach, not the chest. These are the two most common physical methods of relaxation for chronic headache sufferers.
Mental methods.
Also, relaxation therapy can involve mental techniques to decrease body tension. The first is called "focused imagery". Focused imagery involves concentration on relaxed body parts, followed by focus on tense muscles and imagining that the tense areas are being worked on or relaxed. The next mental technique involves focus on the whole body, instead of its individual parts. In "deepening imagery", a person imagines the body's tension as a meter of high to low, and works to reduce tension mentally. An additional mental strategy involves creating and experiencing a location of relaxation in the mind. The last mental strategy involves the chronic headache patient visualizing a place of stress in his or her life and imagining a relaxed response. Meditation in a relaxing environment is also suggested to prevent headaches. Meditation often involves repeating a one syllable sound or staring at a visual object to help focus attention. Relaxation helps the body to unwind, preventing the formation of headaches.
Biofeedback.
Biofeedback is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of relaxation training, because it feeds back information to the chronic headache sufferer about the "body's (biological) current state". One of the most common biofeedback tests is the Electromyograph (EMG), which evaluates the “electrical activity” produced by muscles. Biofeedback also can measure electrical brain activity through a test called the Electroencephalograph (EEG). Another test, called the thermograph, measures skin temperature, because when a person is relaxed they have increased blood flow and a higher temperature. Another method is BVP biofeedback training, which improves chronic headaches by teaching a patient how to regulate and decrease arterial pulse amplitudes by restricting the arteries. When tense, a person's sweat gland activity increases, which is measured by electrodermograph testing of the hands. Biofeedback methods have been proven to work. A study involving fifteen treatment sessions found that biofeedback was "successful in reducing both frequency and severity of headache at discharge and over time". Biofeedback allows headache sufferers to identify problems and then seek to reduce them.
Cryotherapy and Thermotherapy.
Heating and cooling therapy can provide relief to sufferers of chronic headaches. A 2000 study published in the Archives of Family Medicine showed that a combination of pressure and temperature therapy successfully helped to relieve headache pain and decrease the average duration of a headache. Currently there are many products on the market that utilize cryotherapy and thermotherapy as pain relief. One new product on the market that combines cryotherapy and thermotherpy is marketed as SootheAway, a medical device that uses flowing water to maintain a constant temperature.
Changes in diet.
Many physicians also recommend changes in diet to treat chronic headaches. Many chronic headache sufferers fail to recognize foods or beverages as headache factors, because the consumption may not consistently cause headaches or the headaches may be delayed. Many of the chemicals in certain foods can cause chronic headaches, including caffeine, monosodium glutamate (MSG), nitrites, nitrates, tyramine, and alcohols. Some of the foods and beverages that chronic headache sufferers are advised to avoid include caffeinated beverages, chocolate, processed meats, cheese and fermented dairy products, fresh yeast-risen baked goods, nuts, and alcohol as well as certain fruits and vegetables. Additionally, people may have differing dietary triggers on an individualized basis, because not all foods affect people the same way. Different medical professionals suggest different ways of testing or changing diets. Some may suggest eliminating a few of the potentially headache-causing foods at a time for a short period of time, while others suggest removing all the threatening foods from a person's diet and slowly adding a couple back at a time. Yet, others may not suggest diet modification at all. The treatment of chronic headaches through changes in diet is based on personal opinion, and, therefore, controversial.
Behavioral therapy and psychological therapy.
Also, behavioral therapy and psychological therapy are suggested treatments to reduce chronic headaches. Behavioral therapy and psychological therapy relate closely in their treatment methods, which include a combination of identifying headache stressors, biofeedback, relaxation training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy's purpose "is to identify and resolve the sources of recurrent stress". In treatment studies, patients with medication plus cognitive-behavioral therapy groups did better than groups with medication alone or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone. Psychological and behavioral therapies identify stressful situations and teach chronic headache patients to react differently, change their behavior, or adjust attitudes to reduce tension that leads to headaches. Treatments especially focus on "emotional, mental, behavioral, and social factors" as they impact headaches. Patients are advised to simply avoid stressors when plausible or share their burdens with others. In this way, studies have found that patients with multimodal treatment in a group setting fare better than patients who follow multimodal treatment alone. Another behavioral study, which included multimodal treatment, showed that the "frequency of severe headaches was reduced by a clinically significant amount for 75% of the patients". Behavioral and psychological therapies work to identify and eliminate or reduce stressful situations that lead to chronic headaches.
Beyond behavioral modification, psychological therapy has a few distinct characteristics of its own. It is important to look at the psychological status of a chronic headache sufferer to "identify conditions that might interfere with headaches and treatments", such as depression. Also, psychological therapy suggests training in self-hypnosis. While hypnotized, patients are given suggestions to relax and use visual imagery to control headache mechanisms, which is very similar to relaxation therapy. Psychological therapists also analyze personal issues that may interfere in a chronic headache patient’s life, making him or her unable to make changes in lifestyle to improve headaches. Psychologist or psychiatric help for chronic headache patients is controversial, as a patient must be open to possible psychological factors in relation to headaches.

Binge drinking

Binge drinking or heavy episodic drinking is a modern epithet for drinking alcoholic beverages with the primary intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time. It is a kind of purposeful drinking style that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups. The degree of intoxication, however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice. A binge on alcohol can occur over hours, last up to several days, or in the event of extended abuse, even weeks. Due to the long-term effects of alcohol misuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue.
Binge drinking is associated with a profound social harm, economic costs as well as increased disease burden. Binge drinking is more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Most binge drinkers are not familiar with the risks associated with binge drinking. Heavy regular binge drinking is associated with adverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with six percent reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Approximately one in 25 women binge-drinks during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. A large number of adolescents who binge-drink also consume other psychotropic substances.
Binge drinking has the propensity to result in brain damage faster as well as more severely than chronic 'non stop' drinking (alcoholism), due to the neurotoxic effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking, which induces immediate and repeated insults to the brain. The neurotoxic insults to the brain are due to very large amounts of glutamate being released on a repeated basis, which over-stimulates the brain after each binge finishes, resulting in excitotoxicity. The developing adolescent brain is thought to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 4 or 5 drinks once or twice per month.
Definition.
Binge drinking is defined as episodic excessive drinking. There is currently no world wide consensus on how many drinks constitute a "binge", but in the United States, the term is often taken to mean consuming five or more standard drinks (male), or four or more drinks (female), on one occasion. One definition states that 5 drinks for men and 4 drinks for women must be consumed on one occasion at least once in a two-week period for it to be classed as binge drinking. This is colloquially known as the "5/4 definition", and depending on the source, the timeframe can vary. In the United Kingdom, binge drinking is defined as drinking more than twice the daily limit, that is, drinking eight units or more for men or six units or more for women (roughly equivalent to five or four American standard drinks, respectively).
Other, less common definitions are based on blood alcohol concentration (BAC). For example, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines the term "binge drinking" as a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. Whatever the numerical definition used, heavy drinking or rapid consumption over a short period of time with the intention of becoming intoxicated is often implied when the term is used colloquially, since four or five drinks consumed over the course of a whole day and as an accompaniment to meals will not have the same effects as the same amount consumed over a couple of hours on an empty stomach.
In the United States, sometimes the term "extreme drinking" or "industrial-strength bingeing" is used to describe a more severe form of (single-evening) binge drinking; it is often defined as ten or more standard American drinks on a single occasion (sometimes as eight drinks for women). If done over 2 to 3 hours, a typical adult would have a peak BAC of at least 0.20%.
Health effects.
Acute intoxication, such as binge drinking and alcoholism, are known potent risk factors for suicide. Binge drinking is also associated with an increased risk of unplanned sex, unprotected sex, unplanned pregnancies, and an increased risk of HIV infection. 10 percent of women and 19 percent of men have reported being assaulted as a result of alcohol. Males who drink more than 35 units of alcohol per week report being physically hurt as a result of alcohol, and 15 percent report physically hurting others as a result of their drinking. Almost 16 percent of binge drinkers report being taken advantage of sexually, and 8 percent report taking advantage of another person sexually as a result of alcohol within a 1-year period. Heavy drinkers cause approximately 183,000 rapes and sexual assaults, 197,000 robberies, 661,000 aggravated assaults, and 1.7 million simple assaults each year. Binge drinking has been associated with high odds of divorce, spousal abuse, and poor job performance. Binge drinking can cause adverse effects on the body including effects on blood homeostasis and its circadian variation, cardiac rhythm, ischaemic heart disease, blood pressure, white blood cell activity, female reproductive hormone levels as well as adverse effects on the fetus. There is also evidence from animal studies that binge drinking causes brain damage. Binge drinking has been associated with lower abdominal pain in women. Ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking.
Adolescence and young adulthood.
The high levels of binge drinking among young people and the adverse consequences that include increased risk of alcoholism as an adult and liver disease make binge drinking a major public health issue. Recent research has found that young college binge drinkers who drink 4/5+ drinks on more than 3 occasions in the past 2 weeks are statistically 19 times more likely to develop alcoholism than non-binge drinkers, though the direction of causality remains unclear. This is particularly interesting as drinking for the sole purpose of getting drunk, remains a major health and social problem on college campuses across the United States. Heavy and regular binge drinking during adolescence is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism. Approximately 40 percent of alcoholics report heavy drinking during adolescence. Repeated episodes of excessive drinking, especially at an early age, are thought to cause a profound increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-related disorder (ICD-10, harmful use/dependence syndrome). Other risk factors that influence the development of alcohol abuse or alcoholism include social and genetic factors. Several researchers have found that starting drinking before the age of 15 is associated with a fourfold increased risk for developing alcoholism compared to people that delay drinking until age 20 or later. It has been estimated by some that if the age at which people started drinking could be delayed to age 20, there would be a 50 percent reduction in the number of cases of alcohol use disorder. However, it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship, or a function of confounding familial (and other) factors associated with both age at first drink and propensity for alcoholism.
The main cause of death among adolescents as a result of binge drinking is road traffic accidents; a third of all fatal road traffic accidents among 15- to 20-year-olds are associated with drinking alcohol. Cyclists and pedestrians are likely to have less spatial awareness and concentration while travelling after binge drinking and, also, it is more common that adolescents that binge-drink drive drunk or are the passenger of a drunk driver. It has been found that 50 percent of all head injuries in adolescents in the USA are associated with alcohol consumption. Violence and suicide combine to become the third-most-common cause of death associated with binge drinking among adolescents. The suicide risk in adolescents is more than 4 times higher among binge drinkers than non-binge drinking adolescents.
Earlier sexual activity, increased changing of sexual partners, higher rate of unwanted (teenage) pregnancy, higher rate of sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and alcohol-related damage to the fetus during pregnancy is associated with binge drinking. Female binge drinkers are three times more likely to be victims of sexual assault; 50 percent of adolescent girls reporting sexual assault were under the influence of alcohol or another psychotropic substance at the time.
Adolescents who regularly participated in binge drinking for several years show a smaller hippocampus brain region, in particular those who began drinking in early adolescence. Heavy binge drinking is associated with neurocognitive deficits of frontal lobe processing and impaired working memory as well as delayed auditory and verbal memory deficits. Animal studies suggest that the neurodegenerative effects of alcohol abuse during adolescence can be permanent. Research in humans, which utilised sophisticated brain scanning technology suggests that in adolescent teenagers, drinking more than 4 or 5 drinks once or twice a month results in subtle damage to the teenagers developing brain tissue, in particular the white matter. However, this research is primarily cross-sectional and done with fairly small sample sizes, making causality less certain.
Central nervous system.
Heavy binge drinkers tend to have delayed auditory and verbal memory and deficits in executive planning function and episodic memory, which are similar to deficits seen in Korsakoff's syndrome. Impairments in spatial working memory and pattern recognition tasks also have been found in heavy binge drinkers. Impulse control is also impaired in binge drinkers, especially female binge drinkers. Additionally, immediate and delayed recall of verbal and visual information is impaired; conversely, semantic organizational ability is better in binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers. Studies in adolescents have shown that regular binge drinking may cause long-lasting cognitive impairments, though the threshold needed to produce significant effects remains unclear. Cognitive impairment in adults is also unclear, as one study found no association between binge drinking and cognitive impairment. Binge drinking is believed to increase impulsivity due to altered functioning of prefrontal–subcortical and orbitofrontal circuits. Binge drinking and alcoholics who have undergone multiple detoxifications is associated with an inability to interpret facial expressions properly; this is believed to be due to kindling of the amygdala with resultant distortion of neurotransmission. Adolescents, females and young adults are most sensitive to the neuropsychological effects of binge drinking. Adolescence, in particular early adolescence, is a developmental stage that is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic and neurocognitive adverse effects of binge drinking due to it being a time of significant brain development.
Binge drinking regimes are associated with causing an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory amino acids and changes in monoamines release in the central nervous system, which increases neurotoxicity and may result in cogitive impairments, psychological problems and in long-term heavy binge drinkers may cause irreversible brain damage in both adolescents and adults.
While several rat studies indicate that alcohol is more toxic during adolescence than adulthood, some researchers believe that it remains unclear whether this is also the case in humans. Though heavy binge drinking adolescent humans show impaired brain activity during memory tests and underdeveloped brain structures compared to adolescents who did not binge-drink, they argue that these findings are similar to adult alcoholics who did not abuse alcohol during adolescence. Extrapolation from animal studies to humans is notoriously difficult, and a review by the group Choose Responsibility concluded that alcohol's long-term damage to cognitive processes was the same regardless of whether heavy drinking commenced during adolescence or later.
Pregnancy.
Binge drinking is a more important factor rather than average alcohol intake, with regard to the severity of alcohol induced damage to the fetus. Alcohol has definite long-term adverse effects on the fetus, in particular impaired attentional skills and may lead to psychiatric disorders when the child grows up. Approximately one in five nonpregnant women binge-drinks and one in 25 pregnant women binge-drinks. Binge drinking during pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects as well as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. The affected children after birth can suffer mental retardation and problems with learning, memory, attention, problem solving and problems with mental health and social interactions. Deformities in facial features, skeletal and body organs as well as a smaller head circumference are also sometimes present in these children. Studies in sheep indicate that fetal neurotoxicity induced by alcohol may be due to acidaemia and hypercapnia. Binge drinking three or more times during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth.
Sudden death.
Binge drinking is also associated with strokes and sudden death. Binge drinking increases the risk of stroke by 10 times. In countries where binge drinking is commonplace, rates of sudden death on the weekend in young adults and middle aged people increase significantly. The withdrawal phase after an episode of binge drinking is particularly associated with ischaemic stroke as well as subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage in younger men. In individuals with an underlying cardiac disorder a binge on alcohol increases the risk of silent myocardial ischaemia as well as angina. Binge drinking has negative effects on metabolism, lipid profile, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, blood pressure and vascular tone and is associated with embolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Due to these risks experts believe that it is extremely important to warn people of the risks of binge drinking. Binge-drinking by people otherwise considered to be light drinkers is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems and mortality. Binge drinking increases cardiovascular toxicity due to its adverse effects on the electrical conduction system of the heart and the process of atherothrombosis.
Urinary system.
The bladder may rupture if overfilled and not emptied. This can occur in the case of binge drinkers having consumed very large quantities, but are not aware, due to stupor, of the need to urinate. This condition is very rare in women, but it does occur. Symptoms include localized pain and uraemia (poisoning due to reabsorbed waste). The recovery rate is high, with most fatalities due to septic blood poisoning. A person is more likely to urinate while passed out before the bladder ruptures, as alcohol relaxes the muscles that normally control their bladder.
Acute hazards.
The most common risk of consuming massive quantities of alcohol in a short period of time is a dangerously high blood alcohol level. The result is called alcohol poisoning (overdose), which can be fatal. Choking on (or inhalation of) vomit is also a potential cause of death, as are injuries from falls, fights, motor vehicle and bicycle accidents. Another common risk is a blackout (alcohol-related amnesia), which can cause shame, guilt, embarrassment, harm to personal relationships, injury or death, and is also associated with the loss of personal belongings.
Cause.
Culture as well as peer pressure play an important role in driving binge drinking. In adults, binge drinking is more common in people who have never been married, score a grade B or less in education, and is also higher in adults who are not religious.
The reasons for binge drinking by children and adolescents in Europe include:
Other causes include feeling more grown-up and fitting in with peers and to increase the chance of sexual encounters. Some also drink to alleviate stress or anxiety.
Risk factors for binge drinking among adolescents include: low socioeconomic status, large amount of disposable (pocket) money, sensation/novelty seeking, low self-control, delinquency and having delinquent friends. Other risk factors include: using alcohol as a coping strategy for emotional problems (more common in adolescent girls), excessive drinking among peers, poor relationship with parents, alcohol abuse by parents. Genetic conditions combined with a background of negative environmental factors increase the harmful use of alcohol. Additionally the risk-taking behavior associated with adolescence promotes binge drinking.
Pathophysiology.
Binge drinking has the propensity to result in brain damage faster as well as more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism), due to the neurotoxic effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. During the repeated alcohol free stages associated with binge drinking, a larger amount of glutamate is released than occurs during withdrawal from chronic alcohol abuse; additionally this extreme release of glutamate happens on a repeated basis in binge drinkers leading to excitotoxicity. The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking, which induced immediate and repeated insults to the brain.
Impairments in impulse control in binge drinkers, which is more prominent in female binge drinkers, is due to dysfunction of the frontal lobe. The findings in humans have been largely concordant with animal studies. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas that are involved in learning and spatial memory, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A study in rats found that a heavy 2-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge drinking is known to occur as a result of binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge drinking is done to cause brain damage in humans. One study found that humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a 3-year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol, which occurs in heavy binge drinkers, has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural kindling; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals is believed to be the mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Neuronal kindling also leads to each subsequent acute withdrawal episode being more severe than previous withdrawal episodes.
Blackouts, a form of amnesia that occurs in binge drinkers may be due to suppressed hippocampus function with rebound NMDA (glutamate) activity combined with excessive glucocorticoid release induced by the stress of repeated intoxication followed by acute withdrawal/abstinence is the proposed mechanism of neural kindling leading to neurotoxicity of structures involved in learning and memory within the brain of binge drinkers. Frontal lobe processing may become impaired as a result of binge drinking with resultant neurocognitive deficits and impaired working memory.
Alcohol suppresses brain function during intoxication; but upon withdrawal rebound effects occur in the glutamate/NMDA system and with excess glutamate activity glucocorticoid release; due to the repeated intoxication, followed by acute withdrawal, a neurotoxic effect that damages the central nervous system develops, leading to persisting impairments in verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities as well as impairment of spatial orientation. Due to developmental processes occurring during adolescence including myelinization and restructuring of the synapses, adolescents are thought to be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol.
Age and genetic factors influence the risk of developing alcohol-related neurotoxicity. Adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), is a critical and delicate developmental stage for specialised neuronal and synaptic systems mature. This critical developmental stage is where lifelong adult traits e.g., talents, reasoning and complex skills mature; however alcohol and in particular binge drinking may disrupt and interfere with this developmental process. Adolescence is also a period of development characterised by a high level of novel seeking, thrill seeking and risk taking behaviour and thus alcohol and other drug experimentation and abuse is common. An adolescent rat study found that a relatively short exposure to high levels of alcohol resulted in long-lasting changes to functional brain activity with corresponding abnormalities in EEG brain waves that persisted into adulthood, including persisting disturbances in sleep EEG with a reduction in slow wave sleep. These EEG findings are similar to premature aging. According to one review of the literature, if the developmental stage of adolescence is similar to the developmental stage of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents. Indeed, alcohol can affect the remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions that occurs during adolescence ("see this related article").
Diagnosis.
For the purpose of identifying an alcohol use disorder when assessing binge drinking, using a time frame of the past 6 months eliminates false negatives. For example it has been found that using a narrow 2 week window for assessment of binge drinking habits leads to 30 percent of heavy regular binge drinkers wrongly being classed as not having an alcohol use disorder. However, the same researchers also note that recall bias is somewhat enhanced when longer timeframes are used.
Prevention.
Binge drinking is considered harmful, regardless of a person's age, and there have been calls for healthcare professionals to give increased attention to their patients drinking habits, especially binge drinking. Some researchers believe that raising the legal drinking age and screening brief interventions by healthcare providers are the most effective means of reducing morbidity and mortality rates associated with binge drinking. Programs in the United States have thought of numerous ways to help prevent binge drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests increasing the cost of alcohol or the excise taxes, restricting the number of stores who may obtain a license to sell liquor (reducing "outlet density"), and implementing stricter law enforcement of underage drinking laws. There are also a number of individual counseling approaches, such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral approaches, that have been shown to reduce drinking among heavy drinking college students. In 2006, the Wisconsin Initiative to Promote Healthy Lifestyles implemented a program that helps primary care physicians identify and address binge drinking problems in patients. In August 2008, a group of college presidents calling itself the Amethyst Initiative asserted that lowering the legal drinking age to 18 (presumably) was one way to curb the "culture of dangerous binge drinking" among college students. This idea is currently the subject of controversy. Proponents argue that the 21 law forces drinking underground and makes it more dangerous than it has to be, while opponents have claimed that lowering the age would only make the situation worse.
Reduction.
Research shows ways to reduce binge drinking or engage in dangerous driving. Some computer-based intervention appear to reduce binge drinking, an example of which is "rethinking drinking".
Understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.
Treatment.
Due to the risks especially in adolescents, of cognitive impairments and possible irreversible brain damage associated with binge drinking, urgent action has been recommended. There is some evidence that interventions by employers such as, health and life-style checks, psychosocial skills training and peer referral, can reduce the level of binge drinking. In the US brief motivational interventions have shown some benefit in reducing future binge drinking.
Adolescents who misuse alcohol can benefit from interventions aimed at risk reduction. For more severe cases a psychotherapeutic intervention involving parents or guardians is recommended. An effective strategy of intervention for adolescents whose binge drinking leads to admission to hospital, e.g. for alcohol poisoning or injury, is manualised brief interventions at the hospital in one to four counselling sessions each lasting 30 to 60 minutes conducted by trained staff. Evaluation of personal pattern of drinking and associated risks and an emphasis on personal responsibility in a non-condescending manner is recommended during the intervention; discussing and informing/educating the adolescent of possible negative short and long-term consequences of drinking is recommended. The setting of goals and rules to achieve those goals is also recommended during intervention with problem binge drinking adolescents.
Increasing public information and awareness regarding the risks of binge drinking, conducting interviews in emergency departments of young people suspected of harmful drinking patterns and trying to persuade them to accept individual counseling in youth addiction counseling services are effective strategies for reducing the harm of binge drinking. Encouraging recreational training activities such as adventurous training activities such as climbing or driving can be an alternative "natural buzzes" to alcohol misuse. Additionally the provision of educational content about the risks of binge drinking and a risk assessment are beneficial during intervention with young binge drinkers and a referral in the case of an alcohol use disorder for specialised help.
Epidemiology.
Binge drinking is more common in men than it is in women. Among students in the US, approximately 50 percent of men and 39 percent of women binge drink. Racial differences exist among binge drinking with Hispanics followed by white people having the highest level of binge drinking. It is a common pattern among Native Americans.
Individuals of African descent have a lower level of binge drinking followed by those of Asian descent. In the case of Asians their low level of binge drinking may be due to the presence of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2, Chromosome 12) in many (but by no means the vast majority) that results in poor metabolism of alcohol, which leads to severe adverse effects such as facial flushing.
Men are more likely to binge drink (up to 81 percent of alcohol binges are done by men) than women and men are also more likely to develop alcohol dependence than women. People who are homozygous for the ALDH2 gene are less likely to binge-drink due to severe adverse effects that occur even with moderate amounts of alcohol consumption.
Society and culture.
Binge drinking costs the UK economy approximately £20 billion a year; 17 million working days are estimated to be lost due to hangovers and drink-related illness each year. The cost of binge drinking to employers is estimated to be £6.4 billion and the cost per year of alcohol harm is estimated to cost the National Health Service £2.7 billion. Urgent action has been recommended to understand the binge drinking culture and its aetiology and pathogenesis and urgent action has been called for to educate people with regard to the dangers of binge drinking.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a study in October 2011 that showed that in the United States, binge drinking costs society $223-billion a year, which amounts to $2 per drink. These costs include health care costs for alcohol-related issues, including liver cirrhosis, loss of work productivity, property damage due to drunk driving, and expenditures related to criminal acts.
