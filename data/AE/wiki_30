Société Latham

The Société Latham was a French aeronautical construction company which built seaplanes for the French Navy. It is best known for the prototype of the Latham 47 which disappeared in 1928 with Roald Amundsen onboard during a rescue mission to the North Pole in search of Umberto Nobile (a memorial to which was set up in Caudebec-en-Caux in 1931, by the sculptor Robert Delandre and the architect Léon Rey).
The company was set up in 1916 at Caudebec-en-Caux, on the banks of the Seine by Jean Latham, cousin of Hubert Latham. In August 1933 it launched the Blériot 5190 seaplane, christened "Santos-Dumont", equipped with Hispano-Suiza motors with a total horsepower of 650 ch. The company's work was based in Caudebec-en-Caux until a 1951 restructuring of the Latham, Bréguet and Potez companies, in which it was renamed REVIMA (Révision de Matériel Aéronautique) and merged into the Chargeurs Réunis group.

Lionel Tollemache, 5th Earl of Dysart

Lionel Tollemache, 5th Earl of Dysart (August 1734 – 20 February 1799) was a Scottish nobleman, styled Lord Huntingtower from 1727 to 1770.
Lord Huntingtower received no settlement from his father at his majority, and, feeling he owed him nothing, married without his knowledge or consent. The bride was Charlotte, daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, whom he married on 2 October 1760. Charlotte's uncle Horace Walpole called Huntingtower "a very handsome person". He succeeded to the earldom a decade later.
Charlotte died at Ham House on 5 September 1789. Dysart remarried, on 19 April 1791, to Magdalene Lewis, sister of his brother Wilbraham's wife. He had no children by either wife, and upon his death at Ham House in 1799 was succeeded by his brother Wilbraham.

Ces soirées-là

"Ces soirées-là" is a 2000 song recorded by French-born singer/rapper Yannick. It was the second single from his debut album "C'est comme ça qu'on aime" and was released in March 2000. Based on a Claude François' song ("Cette année-là"), it achieved a smash success in France, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time.
Background and structure.
In 1976, the band Four Seasons recorded the hit single "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)". Many years later, Claude François adapted the song in French-language under the title "Cette année-là" ("That Year"). In 2000, Yannick made a partial cover of François' version: it used almost the same music, but changed the verses. The song, a "dancing and joyful rap", is "festive and lively". According to an analysis of an expert of French charts, the song is characterized by "the brass instruments supportthen punctuat[ing the refrain, the rhythmic tune so characteristic (...) and the bass in the soloist passage".
Chart performances.
In France, the song debuted at #13 on March 25, 2000, then climbed and reached #1 three weeks later. It stayed there for 15 consecutive weeks, then dropped rather slowly. It totalled 24 weeks in the top ten, 36 weeks in the top 50 and 37 weeks on the chart (top 100).

Oleśnica, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship

Oleśnica is a village in Staszów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Oleśnica. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-west of Staszów and south-east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,962, and used to be a town from 1470 to 1869.
During the reign of King Kazimierz Wielki, Oleśnica was the seat of a Roman Catholic parish, which covered the area of 49 square kilometers. The village furthermore served as main residence of the noble Oleśnicki family (later, it belonged to the Zborowski family and the Lubomirski family). The father of Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki was born here. 
Oleśnica received Magdeburg rights in the year 1470, and during the Polish Golden Age, it was a small town, with 12 artisans. Furthermore, since the mid-16th century, it was a local center of the Protestant Reformation, with a Calvinist prayer house, opened here in 1563 by Mikolaj Zborowski. The population of the town remained small - in 1673, it was only 184. Oleśnica was completely destroyed in the Great Northern War, and after the Partitions of Poland it briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, to be annexed in 1815 by the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, where it remained unil 1915. Due to proximity of the tightly locked Austrian - Russian border, Oleśnica's development was halted, and finally, after the January Uprising, it lost the town charter. 
Several notable people were born in or connected with Oleśnica. Among them were Dobieslaw Oleśnicki, the castellan of Wojnicz, Lublin and Sandomierz, the starosta of Krakow, who participated in the Battle of Grunwald and commanded the siege of the Malbork Castle in 1410, and Cardinal Zbigniew Olesnicki, the Bishop of Krakow in 1423–1455, as well as many members of the Zborowski family.

The film is a portrait of three "see lai", a colloquial term used in Hong Kong to describe wives, especially housewives, who are approaching or in their middle ages. Mrs. Chan (Amy Shum) is a housewife with a grown-up daughter who tends to be domineering of her husband. Mrs. Lee (Sydney Suet Lei), on the other hand, is meek, with a chauvinistic husband (Ken Tong) and a young son who is troubling her with his poor grades. Mrs. Wong (Crystal Tin) is a garbage lady who has to support a family of four daughters. Her doting tailor husband (Gordon Lam) is out of a job, and the family has to make ends meet nonetheless. Her life is thrown out of order when she is laid off her job.
Mrs Chan and Mrs Lee originally join the belly dancing classes held by foreign teacher Pasha (Pasha Umer Hood) out of curiosity. Pasha replaces their traditional dance teacher and many in the neighborhood are unwilling to learn the dance as they think it indecent. Before long, Mrs Wong and a younger woman, single mother Cherry (Monie Tung), join them. Cherry is a twenty-something gold digger who nonetheless wants to find a father for her baby boy.
The belly dancing classes become the highlight of the lives of these women, as they try to cope with upheavals and stresses in their private lives. Mrs Chan's husband has an affair with a younger girl and she is thinking of divorce, yet unable to take the definitive step to break with her husband. Mrs Lee's husband objects to her classes and bar her from attending them, especially after her understanding mother-in-law faints after dancing too vigorously during a belly dance gathering. Mrs Wong has to deal with the stress of having no income, even though her husband voices his support for her belly dancing. Cherry intends to end her gold digging ways and settle down with someone who can accept her baby son.
The film ends with each finding solution to her problem: Mrs Chan accepts divorce after support from her grown-up daughter; Mrs Lee reunites with her husband after moving out briefly; Mrs Wong finds a new job, and even Cherry discovers someone who cares enough for her and her baby son.

Fatal Vacation

Fatal Vacation (安樂戰場) is a 1989 Hong Kong action/suspense film written by Nam Yin and directed by Eric Tsang. The project was filmed on locations in the Philippines.
Synopsis.
On a visit to the Philippines, a group of unfortunate Hong Kong tourists find themselves abducted by the NPA, a rebel group. Its purpose is to exchange the Chinese men and women for their leader who has been taken in by the Government of the Philippines. The tourists come from a variety of backgrounds; there is Eric Tsang, the guide, his sidekick midget, Irene Wan, a small boy with his grandparents, a trio of gangsters, a couple of police officers, a pair of twins, a womanizer and even prostitutes. 
The tourists do not appear to get along well during the trip; however, some of them exhibit moral development as they realize that all of them need to stick together. Self-sacrifice is also displayed in certain situations when the NPA executes a number of them in order to coerce the Philippine government to hand over their big brother. Little do the antagonists realize that he has already been killed by the military and the holidaymakers witness more of their own mercilessly fall prey to the NPA's cruelty.
In the end, deciding that they must plan a course of action if they are to escape from the NPA, the remaining survivors shoot their way out of the zone they are held in and seek refuge in a cave. The small boy, apparently in search of his missing grandmother who was killed in action earlier while driving the tour bus, is separated from the group. A search party is organized in which the hiding spot of the tourists is almost given away by the innocent child. In what appears to be a do-or-die situation, a chase scene ensues in which the NPA's second-in-command and his subordinates go after a van driven by the tourists. The military's commander dispatches a large number of men in rescuing the hostages and the NPA is confronted by a seemingly hopeless situation as the soldiers have their guns pointed at them.
Despite being heavily outnumbered and aware of the fact that there is no way out, the NPA's second-in-charge ties a bandanna around his forehead while reminding his remaining soldiers about their slogan; never giving up even in the toughest of situations. 
In an effort to do whatever they can, he and his men passionately chant their motto while charging towards the military. After what seems like an endless hail of bullets fired by the soldiers, the NPA finally meets its fate. The movie ends as the tourists are helped out of the van, each's expressions denoting the trauma they have experienced and the memory of the loss of their loved ones.
Reception.
In August 2010, over 20 years since the film's original release, The "Manila Bulletin" noted that the film's plot was echoed by a recent event in the Philippines, where a discharged policeman took a tour bus and its occupants hostage, writing "it’s quite uncanny how this movie shares 3 elements from what recently happened in the local news; the Philippines as the setting, Hong Kong tourists as characters, and a hostage crisis as plot. I know it shouldn’t be a subject for entertainment, but it really makes you think, is life imitating art?"
Robert Firsching of "All Movie Guide" was reminded of campy films such as Ernst von Theumer's "Jungle Warriors" by this film's "straight-faced melding of naive politics and ludicrously unconvincing gunplay." He writes, "To their credit, Tsang and Nam lay out a convincingly horrific series of dire consequences which could result from Hong Kong's impending reunification, but the political message is lost amidst all the gunfire, racist stereotypes, and Times Square grindhouse-level silliness."
"Cinema Far East" writes"On the formal level, there is thanks to the successful staging and sound by Eric Tsang, who delivers himself well in the role of a tour guide. However, some of the acing was flat, and the brutality and rape incorporated into the film was too black and white, with the kidnappers meeting every cliché, and the Filipino characters coming across as racist. The behavior of the innocent hostages is not very credible. Their metamorphosis from completely intimidated and frightened prisoners to desperate battle machines is not exactly conducive to the story."
They offered that the film had redeeming qualities by writing:""Fatal Vacation"'s staging has good points and is a first-class addition to the film. Especially the rare and not very neatly staged action sequences should provide some entertainment for the audience. The special highlight, however, are the scenes in the prison camp, which already anticipate some of the elements of the bearing scenes from John Woo's "Bullet in the Head" and come up with some very intense moments."
"Cinemania" notes that the films of this period tend to borrow heavily from their Hollywood counterparts, and writes "...the plot is fairly light and can be easily followed enough even with out reading the subtitles or understanding what is being said on screen. This movie is a great example of the violent over the top camp produced during this time from HK without being too strange, silly or getting too involved with cultural themes/topics that will alienate Western audiences." They note that the film has both silliness and heavy-handedness without being too bogged-down by either, offering that the film maintains flow and balance.

Rytwiany

Rytwiany is a village in Staszów County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Rytwiany. It lies on the Czarna Staszowska river, approximately south-east of Staszów and south-east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,827.
Rytwiany, which belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, has a rich and long history. First documented owner of the village was a nobleman named Piotr Bogoria Skotnicki (13th century), and across the centuries, Rytwiany belonged to a number of owners, including Cardinal Wojciech Jastrzębiec, Hieronymus Jaroslaw Łaski, the Lubomirski family, the Potocki family, the Radziwiłł family, and several others. 
In 1425 - 1436, Bishop Jastrzębiec built a defensive Gothic castle in Rytwiany, surrounded by the swamps of the Czarna river. The castle, partly destroyed in 1657 (see Deluge) was inhabited until the 19th century, then fell into a ruin, to be finally demolished in 1859. All that now remains of it is a fortified tower. In the early 17th century, when the village and the castle belonged to the Tęczyński family, it was a cultural center of the region. In 1621, upon request of Jan Tęczyński, Camaldolese monks settled here, building an abbey and a church. The monks moved to Warsaw in 1819, and their church now serves as a local parish church. In the late 19th century, the Radziwiłł family, who were the last owners of the village, built here a palace, which was remodelled in 2005 and now is a hotel.

According to the 2002 Poland census, there were 1,672 people residing in Rytwiany village, of whom 49.5% were male and 50.5% were female.

Douglas Crimp

Douglas Crimp (born 1944) is an American professor in art history based at the University of Rochester.
Biography.
Born in Idaho, Crimp went to Tulane University in New Orleans on a scholarship to study art history. His career started after moving to New York in 1967, where he worked as an art critic, writing for different magazines such as "Art News". In 1968 Crimp started working at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum as a curatorial assistant, and later on he worked briefly for the couturier Charles James, helping him write his memoir. 
Between 1971-1976 Crimp taught at The School of Visual Arts before enrolling graduate school at the Graduate Center at CUNY where he studied contemporary art and theory with Rosalind Krauss as the teacher. In 1977 he was hired to be the managing editor of the journal "October", that had been founded by Rosalind Krauss, Annette Michelson, and Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe in 1976. He was quickly appointed to be a co-editor, and he was a central figure in the journal until he quit in 1990.
Shortly after he left "October", Crimp started teaching in the Visual and Cultural Studies Program at the University of Rochester, where he later has been promoted to be the Fanny Knapp Allen Professor of Art History.
Overview.
Crimp has been an important critic in the development of postmodern art theory. In 1977 he curated the influential exhibition "Pictures" at Artists Space, presenting the early work of Sherrie Levine, Jack Goldstein, Phillip Smith, Troy Brauntuch, and Robert Longo. Two years later he elaborated the discussion of postmodern artistic strategies in an essay with the same title in "October", including Cindy Sherman in what was to be known as The Pictures Generation. In his 1980 "October" essay "On the Museum's Ruins" he applies the ideas of Foucault to an analysis of museums, describing them as an "institution of confinement" comparable to the asylums and prisons that are the subjects of Foucault's investigations. His most important work on postmodernist art and institutional critique was published in the 1993 book, "On the Museum’s Ruins".
In 1985, Crimp was one of numerous art critics, curators, and artists who spoke at a General Services Administration hearing in defense of Richard Serra's controversial public sculpture Tilted Arc, which had been commissioned as a site-specific piece for Federal Plaza in New York and was ultimately removed in 1989. 
In 1987 Crimp edited a special AIDS-issue of "October", entitled "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism". In his introduction to the edition Crimp argued for "cultural practices actively participating in the struggle against AIDS and its cultural consequences." During this time he was an active member of the AIDS-activist group ACT UP in New York. "Mourning and Militancy" (1989) discusses the connections between the artistic representations of mourning and the politic interventions of militancy. Crimp argues that these two opposing positions should be allowed to co-exist. In 1990 he published a book entitled "AIDS Demo Graphics" on the activist esthetics of ACT UP together with Adam Rolston. Crimp’s work on AIDS has been seen as an important contribution to the development of queer theory in the US. In 2002 he published all his previous work on AIDS in the book "Melancholia and Moralism – Essays on AIDS and Queer Politics".
Crimp is currently working on memoir with the working title "Before Pictures", on the relationship between the art world and the gay world in New York in the 1960s and 1970s.

Kurzelów

Kurzelów is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Włoszczowa, within Włoszczowa County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Włoszczowa and west of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,200.
The name of the village probably comes from a person named Kurzel, who was its first owner in the 11th century. After the death of Duke Wladyslaw Herman, a defensive gord was established here. The gord was destroyed in the winter of 1108, during a civil war in the Kingdom of Poland, between Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty, and his brother Duke Zbigniew. In 1136, a Roman Catholic parish was established at Kurzelów, and at that time, the village probably belonged to the Gniezno Archbishops. In 1259 or 1260, the village was burned in a Tatar raid (see Mongol invasion of Poland), and in 1285, Archbishop Jakub Swinka granted Kurzelów the Sroda Slaska town charter.
In the 14th century Kurzelów quickly developed, due to two reasons: convenient location along a merchant route from Krakow to Przedborz, and the support of the Archbishops, who turned the local church into a collegiate of St. Adalbert of Prague. In 1306, Kurzelów became the seat of an archdeaconry, which ruled 72 local parishes. In 1342 - 1360, Archbishop Jaroslaw of Bogoria and Skotnik founded here a new, brick collegiate church of St. Mary. The ancient wooden church was preserved until the 18th century. In 1369, a collegiate church school was established here.
In the late 14th century, Kurzelów became one of favorite locations of Archbishop Bodzanta, and in 1425, a synod of Polish bishops took place here. Kurzelów prospered in the Polish Golden Age, when it belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, and received privileges from Zygmunt Stary and Stefan Batory. The decline began in the early 17th century, and one of the causes was the fact that the town frequently changed owners. Complete destruction of Kurzelów was brought by the Swedish invasion of Poland, and the town never recovered after the wars of 1655 - 1660.
Following the Partitions of Poland, Kurzelów briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915, it was part of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. The town further declined, and lost its Roman Catholic deanery, when it was moved to Wloszczowa. Residents of Kurzelów actively supported the January Uprising, for which Russian government decided to punish the town, reducing it to the status of the village in 1869.
In the Second Polish Republic, Kurzelów belonged to Kielce Voivodeship, and during World War II, it was an important center of anti-German resistance. On November 27, 1943, the Wehrmacht burned the village to the ground, shooting 18 residents.
Main point of interest of Kurzelów is the Gothic collegiate church from 1360, whose vault is supported by one pillar. Inside there is a Gothic baptismal font (1414), and next to the church is a wooden bell tower (late 17th century).

Devika

Devika or Prameela Devi (25 April 1943 – 25 April 2002) was a Tamil and Telugu actress. She is regarded as a versatile and graceful heroine of her era. She was known for her natural beauty which was the key in her casting in mythological films like Karnan, thiruvilaiyadal. Her notable films are Sumaithangi, Nenjil oru Aalayam and Marakka Mudiyuma. She started acting at the age of 12. Her spectacular performances made a heart throbe of many people in those days as expressed by Tamil writer Sujatha in one of his old essays.
Personal life.
Devika is the grand daughter of Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu . Ex-mayor of Madras C.Basudev Naidu was the paternal uncle of Devika. She married Devadas on 14 April 1972; they divorced in the late 1990s. Her only daughter Kanaka is one of the famous Tamil actresses of the 1990s.
Earlier life.
Premila changed her name as Devika, which proved to be lucky. In 1958 she made her debut in Mudhalali paired with veteran film actor S.S.Rajendran With the big Tilagam adorning her forehead, the movie was a Block Buster; Devika represented the quintessential Indian woman, caring, self-effacing and sacrificing. Sivaji and Devika figured in some memorable movies like Karnan, that powerful mythological, and the hilarious Bale Pandiya and Kulamagal Radhai, Neelavanam, annai Illam, Pavamanippu among the best.Devika acted only one film with then powerful Tamil super M.G.Ramachandran in Aananthajothi in 1963 which film was produced by villain actor P.S.Veerappa. 
Neela vanam was one of the best movies for her excellent performance. This movie is always memorable and enjoyable her role with Nadigar Thilakam. Devika also made an indelible mark in family drama, the genre that easily wins the hearts of the audience, both urban and rural. With producers churning out such films, some tear-jerkers and others light, and no dearth of heroines, it was due to her talent and charm that Devika got the opportunity to play memorable roles in films like Vanambadi, Vazhkai Padagu and Nenjam Marappadhillai. If the song Sonnathu needhana... in C.V.Sridhar\'s Nenjil Or Aalayam attained immortality the credit for making it visually poignant goes to Devika, who rendered it in the landmark film. She had carved a niche for herself with her grace and beauty at a time when other heroines vied for the top slot. She did total justice to whatever character she portrayed never failing to give a wholesome performance. She was a blend of grace and charm, a versatile actress Devika acted in about 150 films in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.

<doc id="19521512" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19521512" title="Monmouth Council">
Monmouth Council

Monmouth Council, established in 1917, serves all of Monmouth County, New Jersey.
Organization.
The council is divided into 3 districts:
Forestburg Scout Reservation.
Forestburg Scout Reservation (FSR) is a Boy Scout Camp located in Forestburgh, New York. The property is owned by Monmouth Council, New Jersey and offers year round camping in two distinct but connected camps, the J. Fred Billett Camp and the Dan Beard Camp.
History.
The first summer camp session at Forestburg was held in 1956, following the initial land purchase of the estate of Dr. Thomas Darlington, former Health Commissioner for New York City. The camp nearly doubled in size in 1965 with an additional purchase of the Metauk Rod & Gun Club.
Geography.
The three most notable features of the reservation are Burnt Hope Lake, Tecumseh Rock and Darlington Falls. Burnt Hope Lake is a manmade lake originally named Hope Lake, after the Hope Lumber Company, but renamed after fires in 1805 and 1864 put the company out of business.
Programs.
Forestburg features programs in different areas- Waterfront, which includes swimming and boating on Burnt Hope Lake, Scoutcraft, which features pioneering and outdoor skills, Handicraft, which is where skills in creating things are taught, Field Sports, which has shooting-related merit badges, Environmental Conservation, where classes dealing with nature are taught, Technology Center, which teaches science related badges and houses the W2FSR amateur radio station, and Frontier Camp, where the newest scouts work towards Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class Ranks. Unlike its brother camp, FSR does not feature a "theme".
Quail Hill Scout Reservation.
Until 1964 when Monmouth Council purchased the Quail Hill property from sisters Elizabeth and Grace LeValley, it was a working farm. Early maps show barns, a corn crib, and orchards on the property, and even today foundation stones from the old buildings can be seen. The property was intended to replace Camp Housman, the council’s in-council camp since the 1940s. Camp Housman was too small and swampy for the kind of programs the council wanted to implement, including extensive training courses and enhanced Cub Scout camping and activities. 
Chet Fromm was tapped to develop the LeValley sister’s farm into a proper Boy Scout camp. Chet was a former Army man who had been director of training at Housman and a District Executive as well. He served as the first Ranger until retirement in 1983. Subsequent Rangers have been George Leidy, John Herlihy, Randy Blades, Jim Mechkowski and currently, Adam Schumard. 
Between 1964 and 1967 the camp roads and parking lots were constructed, the Webelos and Scout lodges were built, the pond was enlarged to its present size, the campfire bowl was created, and the all-faiths chapel was built. Also, grass seed was sown in the farm fields to create the activities fields we have today. 
Quail Hill was formally dedicated on October 7, 1967. That weekend was also the huge council camporee, the first activity held at Quail Hill. So many people showed up that cars were parked all the way out to Route 33. 
Later additions to the camp included the pool and shower house, the Ranger's house and shops, renovation of the farm’s garage to become Devlin Lodge, BB and archery ranges, and program shelters at the Webelos lodge and Scout lodge. More recently, the Lawrence Training Center and Lass Lodge and a flush toilet facility have been added to the camp. Lass Lodge is built on the site of the original LeValley farmhouse, demolished in the late 1990s. 
In 1975 the Na Tsi Hi lodge opened the Battle of Monmouth Historic Trail. The eleven mile trail, which begins at Quail Hill, takes hikers to many important points in western Monmouth county relating to the important 1778 Revolutionary War battle, and| finally ends in histor||ic Freehold, the county seat of Monmouth. Scout units hike the trail Saturdays between Labor Day and Memorial Day. 
Quail Hill was the first camp in the Northeast Region to offer a Cub Scout day camp, and it continues that tradition to the present day with an exciting summer program featuring both day and resident (overnight) camping for Cubs and Webelos. Throughout the remainder of the year, thousands of Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts participate in Klondike derbies, camporees, Order of the Arrow events, unit campouts, courts of honor, campfires, picnics, and training courses at Quail Hill. There is not a single weekend when something isn’t happening at Quail Hill.
Na Tsi Hi Lodge.
The Order of the Arrow is represented by the Na Tsi Hi Lodge, one of seven lodges in the Northeast Region, Section 5A (NE-5A). It supports the Scouting programs of the Monmouth Council through leadership, camping, and service.
During the 2008 Lodge/Section Reorganization, Na Tsi Lodge was one of the seven lodges to stay with all its other lodges in the same section.
They were the only section to do so.

Tulele Faletolu

Tulele Faletolu, born 21 December in Wellington, New Zealand, is a Christian singer/songwriter and a former worship leader at Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia.
Tulele is of Samoan descent and started singing at a young age. He moved from Wellington to Auckland with his younger brother Tolu to attend the Excel School of Performing Arts in the early 1990s.
In 1997, Tulele and Tolu joined Revelation, a RNB/Funk/Gospel Live Band formed by bass player Carl Gavet. Tulele shared vocal leads with Marcus Temu, Tolu on rhythm keyboards (later becoming the 3rd Lead Vocalist alongside Tulele and Marcus) alongside fellow keyboardist Louis Collins, and James Clay on the drums.
Revelation then relocated to Sydney, Australia in 1999 where the band began to gig at places like the Marble Bar formerly at the Hilton Hotel, The Cave at Star City Casino, and their more regular gigs at the Basement near Circular Quay. It was not long after that Tulele began attending Hillsong Church at Baulkham Hills, and within the following months, he then volunteered to be in the Hillsong Church choir while still singing lead vocals for Revelation.
At the beginning of 2001, Tulele was elevated from a member of the choir to backing vocals and sang and recorded some adlib worship for the songs "Emmanuel" and "Worthy is the Lamb" for "You are My World" even though he was in choir for that album. He was then put forward as a worship leader when his first solo recording was "Away in a Manger" on the Hillsong album "Christmas" followed by a remake of "My Heart Will Trust" on the studio album, "Amazing Love". The first major Hillsong album he sang on was "Blessed" singing "Magnificent" and "King of Majesty". Tulele then left Revelation to concentrate solely on serving in the worship team for Hillsong and Hillsong United. In 2005 during the Hillsong Live album recording, "God He Reigns", he re-united with Marcus Temu & Tolu Faletolu to sing the Mia Fieldes written "All for Love". This would be the last Hillsong album recording that Tulele would appear on as the later released song "Emmanuel" on the "Celebrating Christmas" album was recorded prior to the "God He Reigns" album.
In early October 2010, Tulele performed at his first major public appearance in over 5 years with his brother Tolu at the very first Samoan Music Awards and also at a live concert at Lalomanu Village where the Tsunami struck over 12 months prior to this event as part of the FOB Music Festival in Samoa.
On Sunday, 1 May 2011, Tulele alongside Barry Southgate and Dee Uluirewa did backing vocals with Darlene Zschech leading worship at The inaugural Hope Unlimited Church album recording. This marked the 1st time in 5 1/2 years since Tulele actively sung on a church stage of any sort as the last time was at Hillsong Conference 2004.
On Tuesday Night, 3 July 2012, At Hillsong Conference, Tulele sung backing vocals alongside Darlene Zschech, Israel Houghton, Sid Mohede, Stan Walker and others marking 8 years since his last time singing on that type of platform.

Matz Robert Eriksson

Matz Robert Eriksson or simple Robban as he is often called, is best known as the drummer of Swedish rock band The Hellacopters, who were active between 1994 and 2008. Eriksson is currently playing With his new band called Tramp and recently reunited Swedish punk band Strindbergs.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Eriksson was born in Eskilstuna and moved a few years later to Edsbyn. He got his first drumkit at the age of 13 but didn't get a hi-hat or a cymbal until the next year when he had saved up enough money. Eriksson soon started discovering bands and artists such as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Hep Stars and The Spotnicks. Later he discovered bands such as Iron Maiden, Kiss and Saxon through a relative who worked at a Swedish booking agency. Soon Eriksson started playing drums in various punk, rock and metal bands and got to know Nicke Andersson the drummer of heavy metal band Entombed.
The Hellacopters.
In 1994 Andersson approached him and offered him to play drums in his new band that he was forming with Dregen and childhood friend Kenny Håkansson. The Hellacopters went on to become one of the more important rock bands in the Nordic region and has released six albums with their own material, a cover album, two non album work compilations and a greatest hits album. The band has also toured all over the world and opened up for bands such as Kiss, The Rolling Stones and ZZ Top. In late 2007 the band announced their retirement after the release of Head Off a collection of their favorite songs recorded by the band. The band finished their with four shows in two days that were filmed and broadcast on the band's MySpace page, a double live album and a DVD is currently in the works.
Tramp.
Eriksson is also working with his currently unsigned rock band Tramp, which features members from the Turpentines, Henry Fiat's Open Sore and Captain Murphy. The band is currently unsigned and have two songs released on their official MySpace, Eriksson describes the band's sound as more dramatic similar to early Alice Cooper records.
Other work.
2003 Eriksson joined an all star lineup of Swedish rock musicians to pay tribute to The Nomads, the members of the band liked it so much that the Wild Kings as they called themselves, decided to start the monthly Wild Kingdom club. In 2004 Eriksson participated in a one day project along with Dregen, (Backyard Babies), Måns P. Månsson (The Maggots) and Urkke T (Mary Slim). The band which named themselves Urkke T & the Midlife Crisis released "Ask Not What You Can Do For Your Country..." in 2004. Currently Eriksson is also working at a youth center that focuses on keeping young people away from drugs and crime and more involved with music. Recently Eriksson posted videos of himself playing a drumsolo on a drum set made of ice at the Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi. Later this year Eriksson will perform with the recently reunited Swedish punkband Strindbergs.
Kit setup.
Eriksson owns and uses a number of different drum kits, however his main kit consists of Pearl EXR drums with Sabian cymbals.

Günter Fruhtrunk (May, 1923 - December 12, 1982) was a German painter and printmaker, who is classified as a geometric abstract artist and whose work relates to Op Art. 
Fruhtrunk studied architecture at the 'Technische Hochschule' in Munich, which he gave up after two semesters to join the army as a volunteer in the fall of 1941. In 1945, Fruhtrunk began to study privately under the painter and printmaker William Straube in Neufrach, who was a student of Hölzel and Matisse. In 1954 he received a scholarship from the Land Baden-Württemberg and the Gouvernement Français and moved to Paris, to work in the studios of Léger and Arp. During the 1960s the painter mainly lived and worked in France. In 1961 he received the Prix Jean Arp in Cologne and in 1966 he was awarded the silver medal of the Prix d'Europe in Ostende. In 1963 he appeared in the film documentary "School of Paris: (5 Artists at Work)" by American filmmaker Warren Forma. In 1967, Fruhtrunk began teaching at the Munich art academy. It was Fruhtrunk who transformed the ideas of Constructivism to a colorful rhythmical pictorial world, by creating a dynamic language of form with vector-like diagonal lines arranged strictly rhythmically according to their alternating colors. Fruhtrunk committed suicide in his studio at the Munich art academy on December 12, 1982.

MTS India

Sistema Shyam TeleServices Limited (SSTL), also known as Mobile TeleSystems and commonly referred to by the abbreviation MTS, is the Indian subdivision of Russian Mobile TeleSystems telecommunication company headquartered in New Delhi, India. It provides wireless voice, broadband Internet, messaging and data services in India. MTS India is a subsidiary of Russian conglomerate Sistema and operates across India with over 16 million customers as on 2012.
History.
Sistema, the largest public diversified corporation in Russia, acquired a 10% stake in Shyam Telelink for a total cash consideration of US$ 11.4 million at the end of September 2007. Shantanu Telecom along with their partner Sistema had applied for UASL licence in 22 telecom circles of India. In August 2008, they became the first new mobile operator to get a pan-India start-up spectrum to start their mobile service operations in the country. They provide mobile services based on CDMA technology under the brand name MTS India. Shyam Telecom gave Project to ZTE and Huawei for their network expansion. MTS launched operations in Uttar Pradesh East and West in October 2010.
On 2 February 2012, the Supreme Court of India cancelled 122 licences of 22 mobile operators, including 21 of MTS' 22 licences, in connexion with the 2G spectrum scam. MTS lost all its licences except the one for Rajasthan circle. The Supreme Court directed the Government of India to conduct fresh auctions for sale of the spectrum within a period of four months, asking the TRAI to come up with fresh recommendations. On 21 February 2013, MTS officially announced that it would participate in the spectrum auction in March 2013, and had filed application in the Supreme Court in January 2013, stating that it intended to do so. On the same date, MTS also announced that it would close operations in 10 telecom circles within 30 days. The 10 circles are - Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, North East, Orissa and Punjab. MTS had approximately 2.32 million subscribers in those 10 circles at the time of the announcement. MTS had a total national subscriber base of 14.88 million. According to MTS officials, the 10 circles where MTS ceased operations constituted 15.62% of its total subscriber base and less than 15% of the company's overall revenue.
In the 2013 spectrum auction, MTS won back licences and spectrum in 8 circles - Delhi NCR, Kolkata, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh (West) & West Bengal. SSTL chose not to bid for Mumbai, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh (East), which meant that it would have to close operations in those circles. MTS had over 15 lakh subscribers in those 3 circles at the time.
MTS Mblaze (EVDO Rev. A).
MTS launched EVDO Rev A based high-speed mobile broadband service, MBlaze, in November 2009 and has seen tremendous market acceptance with over 5 lakh (As per February 2011 Data) customers in a short span of time. In April 2010, MTS launched MTS TV for MTS MBlaze customers. MTS MBlaze have its coverage in 100+ cities as of February 2011. MTS has also announced pan-India roaming for its users in April–May 2010. MTS also provides MBrowse which is CDMA-1x technology based internet service.
According to Vsevolod Rozanov, President & CEO, MTS India, "With a view to enhance customer experience, MTS has prepared a blue print to take the mobile broadband usage in the country to the next level. In a phased manner, MTS will be launching seamless HSD services across some of the busiest highways in the country. 
The National Broadband Plan envisages provision of 160 million broadband connexions including 60 million wireless broadband connections by the year 2014. Hence, there is a huge opportunity for the growth and proliferation of High Speed Mobile Broadband services in the country. MTS is rapidly expanding its high speed data (HSD) network and currently addresses over 92% of data potential across India.
MTS Mblaze Ultra (3GPLUS / EVDO Rev. B Phase II).
On 5 September, MTS India announced the commercial availability of its EVDO Rev B Phase 2 network (dubbed as 3GPLUS) which is capable of offering peak downlink of 9.8 Mbit/s. Started with Jaipur, as Shyam Group's home town MTS MBlaze Ultra will be rolled out in top metros and other cities of India very soon.
On 23 October 2013 SSTL announced its roll out plan of its 3GPLUS network in nine circles namely Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kolkata, Uttar Pradesh (West) and West Bengal. Along with 3GPLUS, the company started offering its MTS Mblaze Ultra data dongles.
National Telecom Award.
MTS, the mobile telephony brand of Sistema-Shyam Teleservices (SSTL) has been conferred National Telecom Award for being the
fastest growing data operator in India. Mr. Vsevolod Rozanov, CEO, Sistema Shyam TeleServices Ltd. received the award on behalf of the company from
Mr J S Sarma, Chairman, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and Mr P J Thomas, Secretary, Department of Telecom, Government of India. The award is
recognition of MTS establishing itself as a fastest growing data operator in the market.
MTS has close to one lakh mobile broadband subscribers in less than six months, for its high speed mobile broadband service, MBlaze. Within a short span time, the company has launched its services in 15 telecom circles (UP East and West is the latest circle) across the country and has 
already achieved an overall subscriber base of 80 lakh customers.
Network presence.
At its peak, MTS operated services in 21 out of 22 telecom circles of India. However, MTS has shut services in 13 circles and currently operates in 9 circles.

Astrid Olofsdotter

Astrid Olofsdotter (Norwegian: "Astrid Olavsdatter"; English: "Aestrith") (died 1035) was the Queen Consort of King Olav II of Norway.
Biography.
Astrid was born to King Olof Skötkonung of Sweden and his Obotritian mistress Edla. She was the half sister of King Anund Jacob of Sweden and sister of King Emund the Old of Sweden. It is said that she and her brother Emund were not treated well by their stepmother, Queen Estrid of the Obotrites, and that they were sent away to foster parents. Astrid was sent to a man named Egil in Västergötland.
In 1016, it had been decided that Norway and Sweden should come to more peaceful relations by a royal marriage alliance. Noblemen of both countries tried to arrange a marriage between King Olav of Norway and the half sister of Astrid, Princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden. King Olof of Sweden agreed at first but broke his promise. King Olav was supposed to have married Astrid's half sister, Olof Skötkonung's legitimate daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden. Ingegerd was, however, after his father's wishes instead married to Yaroslav I the Wise, Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev. Astrid was married to King Olav in Sarpsborg in 1019. Some sources claim that Astrid replaced Ingegerd by the wish of her father. Other sources claim that the marriage took place against the will of her father, by the cooperation of King Olav of Norway and the Swedish jarl Ragnvald Ulfsson.
Astrid was described as beautiful, articulate and generous, and well liked by others. She was probably the mother of Wulfhild of Norway (1020–1070), wife of Ordulf, Duke of Saxony. She was the stepmother of King Magnus the Good, with whom she had a good relationship. In 1030, she was widowed when her husband was killed. She left Norway and settled in the Swedish court, where she had a high position. When her stepson Magnus visited Sigtuna on his way to claim the Norwegian throne, she gave him her official support and encouraged Sweden to do so as well.

Beijing No.4 High School

Beijing No.4 High School (, pinyin: Běijīng shì dìsì zhōngxué), commonly abbreviated as Beijing Sizhong () and sometimes referred to as Beijing High School Four (BHSF), is a highly prestigious public beacon high school in Xicheng District, Beijng, China. It is one of the most reputable high schools in China. It was established in 1907 by the Shun Tian Government (Beijing Government) during the Qing Dynasty, known as the "Shun Tian Secondary School" at the time. After the Xinhai Revolution, the school was renamed as "Capital Public No.4 Secondary School" (京师公立第四中学), which was not changed into the current name until 1949, when the People's Republic of China was proclaimed. The school was among the first to be accredited as "Municipal Model High School" by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education. More than 200 students from the school have won medals in municipal, national and international competitions every year. More than 96 percent of its graduates passed the enrollment line of key universities in National Higher Education Entrance Examination.
History.
Late Qing Dynasty period.
Beijing No.4 High School is one of the oldest schools in Beijing. Its predecessor Shun Tian Secondary School (顺天中学堂) was founded in 1906 by the then Shun Tian Government (Peking Government) of the Qing Dynasty. Along with a few other primary and secondary schools established, the government nullified the imperial examination system and commenced a more institutional system on academic studies and education as a result of the Hundred Days' Reform.
Exchange.
On November 11, 2013 Park Tudor School announced an exchange with the school.
ROC period.
During the ROC period, the Capital Department of Education Affairs (京师学务局) exercised jurisdiction over the school and renamed it Capital Public No.4 Secondary School (京师公立第四中学) on September 29, 1912, which is thus the anniversary commemorated until today.
The May Fourth Movement of 1919 involved representative students from the school to parade and assemble at Tiananmen. After the city was invaded In 1939 by Japan, the school was mandated to conduct education of enslavement by Japan. The surrender of Japan in 1945 ended enslaved education, and the ROC government took over, with Sun Lubing (孙鹿宾) being principal. At that time, the secret service of the CPC had been developing secret CPC members within the school.
In 1945, alumni from Tsinghua University, Yenching University and Peiyang University who argued against the Chinese Civil War propagated their ideas to Senior Grade 3 students in an auditorium in the Beijing No.4 High School. When the local police arrived and besieged the auditorium, a conflict with the students broke out, with several students injured by bayonet. The police then bound the alumni. The Mayor of Peking He Siyuan (何思源) dispatched personnel to unbind them and apologized to the students.
From late 1948 to early 1949, the school was forced to cease its teaching and suspend classes when the KMT army occupied the school, turned its buildings and campus into barracks and battlefield to fight against CPC in the Civil War.
PRC period.
The Communist Party of China assumed control of the city on January 31, 1949. On March 15, the Beijing Military Management Commission (北京市军管会) sent Li Fusheng (李复生) to take over the school as principal. In April, 1949, it set a CYLC branch and a CPC branch, and established a students union. It was at this time that the school was renamed to Beijing No.4 High School (北京市第四中学).
On November 7, 1995, the then CPC General Secretary, Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a visit to the school. He highly praised it, observing:
I’ve long heard of your great name, reverberating like thunder. I’m greatly honored to be here.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) sent an evaluating delegation to inspect Beijing in February 2001. The No.4 High School was the only educational organ that received the evaluating committee. It was believed to have contributed to the success of Beijing in the 2008 Summer Olympics bidding.
On August 6, 2007, IOC President Jacques Rogge visited the school and delivered a speech there.
Incumbent Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited the No.4 High School on September 4, 2007. There, he remarked:
Beijing No.4 High School is supposed to be developed into a world-class one and China should have more schools of this kind. This is our hope.
On August 7, 2008, the day before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, the school was visited by the wife of IOC President Jacques Rogge, Anne Rogge and other foreign guests.
On May 5, 2011, NBA player Roy Hibbert of Indiana Pacers visited the school as a part of the NBA Cares program. The Center taught the students some basketball skills.
School.
Title.
The calligraphic title Beijing Sizhong (北京四中, literally Beijing No.4 High School ) was inscribed by Guo Moruo.
School emblem.
The school emblem features the old school gate built in 1929.
School anthem.
The school anthem "Song of Hope and Ideal" (希望和理想之歌) is composed by composer Shi Guangnan (施光南) and written by the collective.
Campus.
Old campus.
Historically, Shun Tian Secondary School (顺天中学堂) was situated in Wanping Senior Primary School (宛平高等小学堂) Capital Houku (京师后库) (Houku, Xicheng District, Beijing). The very old campus had been renovated and rebuilt many times, while the site was not changed. It occupied 65,733 m², of which the playground occupied 27,067 m², including basketball courts, tennis courts, football pitch, and volleyball courts. On the campus, there were around 1,500 trees and flowers in approximately 100 kinds. It also had a botanical garden where crops grown and a well pavilion.
Current campus.
The People’s Municipal Government of Beijing rebuilt the school in 1983 and it was extended to occupy an area of 46372 m². The school was designed by architect Huang Hui.
The principal’s office (校长室) is the only structure in archaic style, which is conserved from the old campus period. PO has a balcony popularly known as Wang Yue Tai (望月台). The 6-storey Experiment Building (实验楼) has laboratories for chemistry, physics and biology, and computer rooms. On the sixth floor there is an observatory.The Administration Building (办公楼) built in 2003, has space for teachers and staff to work, and provides conference rooms.
The school offers a stadium with plastic field, in which there are a football pitch, two volleyball courts, six basketball playgrounds, and other track and field facilities. A multi-purpose gymnasium is also inside of the school, where there are rooms for table tennis, a gym and a 200-meter swimming pool. There are also cafeterias, auditoria, and students dormitories.
The corridor from Teaching Building to Experiment Building is one of the more notable characteristics in Beijing No.4 High School.
Teaching Building.
Each floor of this four-storey structure has eight classrooms, which are shaped in hexagon instead of rectangle. This design facilitates large capacity, small sight range and small visual angle that are really conducive to teaching and learning in the classrooms. The corridors shaped by the hexagonal classrooms are also convenient for emergency evacuation and break-time amusement.
Beijing No. 4 Online School.
Beijing No. 4 Online School is a distance education platform of Beijing No.4 High School. It is a perfect combination of high technology and good education resources, which connects teachers and students in No. 4 High School and the others in other places.

Exchange.
Park Tudor announced on November 11 that they would be beginning an exchange with the school.

Painted Skin (1993 film)

Painted Skin () is a 1993 Hong Kong supernatural horror film starring Adam Cheng, Joey Wong, Sammo Hung, Lam Ching Ying, and Wu Ma. It was directed by King Hu.
It is based, very loosely, on a famous story in Pu Songling's classic short story collection, "Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio".
Story.
A scholar (Adam Cheng) encounters a beautiful maiden (Joey Wong) in an alley on his way home and leads her to his house, where he tries to marry her as a concubine. By chance, his wife and he discover that she is in fact a ghost, who must "paint" and graft a facial skin mask over her face to look human. Terrified, the scholar enlists the help of two Taoist priests, who give him a magic whisk to keep the ghost at bay. However, it appears that the ghost is benign – she merely wants to escape the clutches of an evil Yin-Yang King, a faceless, powerful spirit-king who shuttles at ease between the mortal world and the spirit, and who seems to be controlling the destinies of some recently deceased souls.
The two Taoist priests battle the King to release the ghost, but realize their magical prowess is not sufficient. Instead, they use the ghost to track down a highly skilled Taoist Master (Sammo Hung) in the countryside. Meanwhile, the Yin-Yang King possesses the scholar and is wreaking havoc in the mortal plane. The priests finally discover and convince the Taoist Master, who decides to destroy the evil spirit-king so as to guide the ghost back to Hades.

Secemin

Secemin is a village in Włoszczowa County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Secemin. It lies historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-west of Włoszczowa and west of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,600, and used to be a town in 1401 - 1869. Its name comes from the local swamps, called sece. 
Secemin has a long and rich history, which dates back to a defensive gord, established in the 13th century among swamps and forests, in the proximity to the medieval merchant routes. Earliest documented mention of Secemin comes from the year 1291, when Duke of Krakow and Sandomierz, Boleslaw V the Chaste met here with monks from Henrykow. In the 14th century, Secemin was a settlement, with a watermill and a forge, as well as a Roman Catholic parish church. 
In 1401, Secemin received Magdeburg rights town charter from King Wladyslaw Jagiello (according to some other sources, Secemin received the charter in the mid-14th century, from King Kazimierz Wielki). The town was allowed to organize two fairs a year, as well as weekly markets. Following the order of King Jagiello, Secemin became property of knight Piotr Szafraniec (Starykon coat of arms), who had distinguished himself in the Battle of Grunwald. Szafraniec funded a stone church, and in the late Middle Ages, Secemin emerged as a local center of artisans, with butchers, shoemakers, potters, clothmakers, two watermills and a bath. The town was located on a very busy merchant route from Gdansk to Krakow. 
Secemin remained in the hands of the Szafraniec family, which resided in a fortified manor house. Krzysztof Szafraniec, the son of Piotr Szafraniec, was a highwayman and a kidnapper. Captured by the starosta of Krakow, he was executed in 1484. In 1519, King Zygmunt Stary confirmed Secemin’s Magdeburg rights, and gave permission for three more fairs annually. In 1540, the population of the town was 600, and during the Protestant Reformation, it became one of centers of Calvinism in Lesser Poland. In 1553, Stanislaw Szafraniec opened here a Calvinist prayer house, and in 1556–1617, as many as 23 Calvinist synods took place here. In the mid-16th century, Secemin was the residence of Felix Cruciger, the superintendent of the Reformed churches of Lesser Poland. Cruciger died here on April 12, 1563. Apart from the prayer house, local Calvinists opened here a renowned school, which was supported, among others, by Mikolaj Rej, who lived in the nearby Naglowice. The school was famous for its rich library, its last chairman was a Frenchman named Jan Poetevinus. 
Secemin prospered in the period known as the Polish Golden Age. The decline of the town began during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland (1650s), when it lost most of the population, which was replaced by Jewish settlers. Secemin remained in the hands of the Szafraniec family until the mid-17th century, when, as a dowry, it was transferred to Jan Samuel Czarnocki (Lis coat of arms), the husband of Zofia Szafraniec. The Czarnockis owned the town until 1788, building here a manor house, which was demolished in the 1970s. 
Until the Partitions of Poland, Secemin belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1815 - 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and in 1821, its population was 833, with 110 houses, most of which were made of timber. In 1862, the town almost completely burned in a great fire, and after the January Uprising, Russian government reduced Secemin to the status of a village. In the Second Polish Republic, Secemin belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. On September 3, 1939, the village was captured by the Wehrmacht. Secemin was an important center of anti-German resistance. In November 1943, a skirmish between the Germans and a Home Army unit took place here. As a reprisal, the Germans shot 44 residents of the village. On October 27, 1944, a large battle took place near Secemin, in which units of the Home Army and the Bataliony Chlopskie fought the Wehrmacht. 
Among points of interest there is a Gothic church (1402), which in 1554 - 1617 was a Calvinist prayer house. There also are remains of a 16th-century moat, which protected the Szafraniec family manor house.

Freddie Viggers

Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Richard "Freddie" Viggers is a former senior British Army officer, who served as Adjutant-General to the Forces immediately prior to his retirement 2008. He served as Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod from 30 April 2009 to 28 October 2010. He also served in Bosnia in the aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia, and in the Iraq War.
Early life.
Viggers was educated at Wellington School, Somerset. 
Military career.
Having attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Viggers was commissioned into the Royal Regiment of Artillery as a second lieutenant on 14 April 1972. He was promoted lieutenant on 14 October 1973, and captain on 14 April 1978, In 1983 he attended Staff College, Camberley and was promoted major on 30 September 1983, and assumed command of a battery of 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery (3RHA). In December 1985 he was appointed Chief of Staff to 1st Infantry Brigade, the brigade's main task was as NATO's "UK Mobile Force", which would have seen it reinforcing Denmark, or the Schleswig-Holstein area of Germany. As a result of his performance in this post, especially for his organisation of British participation in the NATO multi-national Operation Bold Guard, he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1988 New Year Honours. The citation for this honour remarked: "1st Infantry Brigade is closer in size to a normal division[, its] strength rising to over 15,000 when formed into the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF).[...]Viggers enjoys a responsibility and workload far greater than that normally given to a Grade 2 officer. [... His contribution] has been quite outstanding, and far beyond the call of duty expected of an officer of his age and service." He was promoted lieutenant colonel on 30 June 1988, and was initially posted to the directing staff at Camberley before taking command of 3RHA in 1989. The regiment transferred from Germany to Colchester Garrison in early 1990, joining 19th Infantry Brigade.
Viggers was promoted colonel on 30 June 1992, and served at the Ministry of Defence in the Central Staff Directorate of Defence Policy, transferring to the Defence Costs Study Secretariat in 1993. Promoted brigadier on 30 December 1994 (with seniority from 30 June 1994), he became Commander, Royal Artillery in HQ 3 (UK) Division in 1994 and attended the Higher Command and Staff Course before deploying to Bosnia with the division as part of the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR). He was then posted as Director of Manning (Army) in 1997, and was appointed Honorary Colonel of 100th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers) on 31 December 1997, holding that appointment until 17 February 2001.
On 24 March 1999 Viggers returned to Bosnia as Commander Multi-National Division (South-West) in SFOR and was granted acting promotion to major general), substantive promotion followed on 1 September 1999 (with seniority from the date of his acting rank). For his service there, he was awarded the Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service on 3 November 2000. On 9 February 2000 he became Chief of Staff at Land Command and remained there until May 2003. He received a further honorary appointment on 11 May 2000 when he became Deputy Colonel Commandant of the Adjutant General's Corps. In May 2003 he was appointed Senior British Military Representative and Deputy Commanding General, Multinational Force, Iraq, based in Baghdad following its occupation by US and British forces; for his service there he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 23 April 2004. His next post was as Military Secretary and Chief Executive Army Personnel Centre which he took up on 20 October 2003.
Adjutant General.
On 4 April 2005 Viggers became Adjutant General, and was promoted lieutenant general. He became Colonel Commandant Royal Regiment of Artillery on 1 July 2005, and Colonel Commandant Adjutant General’s Corps on 3 November 2003, holding that appointment until 28 July 2008. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the New Year Honours 2007. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire in June 2008.
Viggers's period as Adjutant General coincided with heavy commitments for the British Army, which led to increased media discussion of the pay and conditions in the British Armed forces. He spoke out against the conditions in some barracks, and of the need for improved funding to bring accommodation stock up-to-date. On 7 May 2007 "The Mail on Sunday" published an article claiming that his house had been renovated at the taxpayers' expense, and he was also named in a 26 May article on the amount spent on accommodation and servants for high-ranking army officers. However Viggers complained to the Press Complaints Commission and "The Mail on Sunday" subsequently printed an apology, accepting that the accommodation renovated was in fact an MOD property, and he had not been to blame for the state of military housing. He also issued an apology and authorised the payment of £3 million in compensation to the families of Baha Mousa and nine other Iraqis tortured by British troops.
Viggers retired on 29 October 2008. 
Later life.
In December 2008 it was announced that Viggers had been appointed to the House of Lords position of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. He replaced Sir Michael Willcocks on 30 April 2009 when Willcocks retired. On 18 May 2010, he was due to take part in the ceremonial opening of Parliament following the 2010 general election, but he suffered a multiple stroke and was unable to attend. His place was taken by his deputy, the Yeoman Usher, Ted Lloyd-Jukes. He resigned as Black Rod because of ill health on 28 October 2010.
Viggers is married with two children, and has a keen interest in sport. He is a trustee of the Army Museums Ogilby Trust which assists British Army regimental and corps museums; he is also an Honorary Fellow, and member of the advisory group, of the Institute of Continuing Professional Development; and has assisted in running events for the Army Benevolent Fund. On 9 December 2009, Viggers gave evidence to The Iraq Inquiry in which he was highly critical of the administration of post-war Iraq.

Aruni

In the Hinduism, Aruni or Uddalaka or Uddalaka Aruni was one among the disciples of sage Ayodha Dhaumya, along with Upamanyu and another named 'Veda' (Mbh 1.3). Aruni hailed from the country of Panchala and was known as "Aruni of Panchala".
As per Mahabharata (MBh 1.3), on one rainy night Aruni's preceptor Dhaumya Muni asked him to supervise water flowing through a certain field. Aruni went there and found that water had breached the field and was moving away from its designated path. Aruni tried to stop water by all means but was unsuccessful. Left with no other way, Aruni lay down on the breach and prevented the water flow using his body. Due to this Aruni did not return to the hermitage in the night. Later in the morning, Dhaumya Muni came to the spot in search of Aruni with other disciples. Upon seeing the dedication and sincerity of Aruni, Dhaumya was very pleased upon Aruni and gave him the title "Uddalaka". Later Aruni became very famous under the name Uddalaka Aruni.
Several other scriptures have references to the sage Uddalaka Aruni.
In the Katha Upanishad, Uddalaka Aruni has been portrayed as a very learned sage who had performed numerous yajnas and sacrifices. Uddalaka Aruni was also called Vajashravas because he organised innumerable community feeding programmes. Vajashravas had one negative quality as he had no control over his anger and flew into uncontrollable rage at trifles. His wife was Vishwavaradevi. The son of Vajashravas was the great young seeker Nachiketa. In a feat of rage Vajashravas had given Nachiketa to Yama, the death.
As per the Chāndogya Upanishad, Uddalaka was the son of Aruni and was therefore known as Uddalaka Aruni. Uddalaka was the father and teacher of young scholar Shvetaketu.
Uddalaka Aruni is said to have systematised the Vedic and Upanishadic thoughts. Many Mahavakyas are ascribed to sage Uddalaka Aruni. Among those, "Tat Tvam Asi" illumines the Chāndogya Upanishad, which is a part of the Sama Veda. This great utterance is repeated nine times in this Upanishad as the ultimate Truth, which reveals itself as the conclusion of each inner experiment. The teacher is Uddalaka and the student Svetaketu, his son, engaged in a profound soul-education.

Ruthann Aron

Ruthann Greenzweig Aron (b. October 24, 1942, in the Brooklyn borough of New York) is a convicted criminal, former politician and former real estate developer who ran unsuccessfully for the 1994 Republican United States Senate nomination from Maryland. A member of the Montgomery County Planning Board, she lost the nomination to former Tennessee Senator Bill Brock, who was in turn defeated by incumbent Paul Sarbanes. After Brock lost to Sarbanes, Aron sued Brock for slander based on comments he made about her during the primary campaign. Brock had said, at a September 1994 press conference, "She has been convicted by jury of fraud, more than once."
In reality, juries had ruled against Aron in two civil lawsuits in which former business partners accused her of fraud or other offenses. A federal judge overturned one of the verdicts, and Aron settled both suits out of court after agreeing to pay about $175,000 in each case. At the slander trial, Aron cited Brock's use of the term "convicted" for verdicts that had come in civil court. Lawyer Arthur Kahn, who had prosecuted one of the fraud cases, testified against Aron at the February 1996 trial, which Aron lost. Nonetheless, it was the first time that a losing federal candidate was able to get the winner into court over words spoken in a campaign.
Aron was arrested in June 1997 for trying to hire a hitman, William "Billy" Mossberg, a local landfill owner who immediately went to the police. The police asked Mossberg to work with them and he then agreed to murder her husband and Kahn. She was ousted from the Planning Board in August 1997. At the time of her arrest, she was planning to run, as a Democrat, for an at-large seat on the Montgomery County Council. In her first trial, she used nine psychiatrists/psychologists to argue that a brain injury and her childhood abuse had rendered her incapable of realizing that what she was doing was illegal. Aron was diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder by multiple psychiatrists. One juror held out on her behalf, and a mistrial was declared.
In July 1998, Aron pleaded no contest, and in November 1998 she was sentenced to two consecutive 18-month prison sentences. She was released in 2001 and said she moved to New York City.
Her son Joshua Todd Aron was a graduate of Cornell University who was working at Cantor Fitzgerald at the time of his death. On September 11, 2001, Joshua died in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
Aron's daughter Dana Aron Weiner is a psychologist who works at Northwestern University in Chicago. At Aron's trial, Weiner cried to the judge that her mother should be set free with no jail time.
Aron still lives in New York City.
In 2004, Aron's case was profiled on the Oxygen Network series "Snapped", which profiles female criminals, and also on the truTV series "Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice". In 2006, her case was profiled in an episode of "City Confidential".

Petra Diamonds

Petra Diamonds Ltd is a diamond mining group. headquartered in Jersey. It has a diversified portfolio, with interests in eight producing mines in South Africa and Tanzania and an exploration programme in Botswana. Petra Diamonds' focus has shifted from exploration to production, becoming one of the largest independent producers of diamonds in Africa. In June 2012, Petra owns 5 of the world's most productive mines historically. These mines include the Cullinan Diamond Mine famed for having produced the world's largest rough and polished diamond. 
Petra is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
History.
Petra Diamonds was founded by Adonis Pouroulis in 1997 and was first listed on the Alternative Investment Market later that year. It transferred to the Main Market in December 2011.
Operations.
Petra Diamonds' operations are focused in Africa, which produces circa 60% of the world's diamonds by value. It has grown by acquisition, acquiring five mines in South Africa and Tanzania from De Beers. Petra's exploration activities are focused in Botswana, the world's largest diamond producer by value and host to two of the world's biggest diamond mines, Orapa diamond mine and Jwaneng diamond mine.
South Africa.
Petra Diamonds operates seven producing diamond mines in South Africa. These break down into two categories: the underground kimberlite pipe mines (Cullinan, Finsch, Koffiefontein and Kimberley Underground) and the Fissure Mines (Helam, Sedibeng and Star). Petra Diamonds has a record of turning De Beers' unprofitable South African mines into financial successes. According to Nicky Oppenheimer, Chairman of De Beers, the reason for this was "De Beers was operating the mines with too large a cost structure, something Petra doesn't have." The underground kimberlite mines were purchased from De Beers Consolidated Mines. 
Finsch Mine.
Finsch diamond mine is one of the world's most important diamonds mines and South Africa's second largest diamond operation by production. On 14 September 2011, Petra purchased Finsch as a fully staffed, operating mine from De Beers for a total consideration of ZAR1.4 billion. Finsch is a major producer, having supplied over 126 million carats in its 40 plus year life to date. Petra is currently implementing a development plan to lift production from ca. 1.4 million carats per annum to 1.9 million carats per annum by FY 2017 (involving both underground and tailings production).
Cullinan Mine.
In July 2008, Petra led a consortium which acquired the Cullinan diamond mine from De Beers Consolidated Mines for a total cash consideration of ZAR1 billion. In line with the South African Mining Charter, the Petra Diamonds Cullinan Consortium included broad based Black Economic Empowerment partners. 
The Cullinan kimberlite pipe is the second largest indicated diamond resource in the world by in-situ value. The current operating levels include the B-Cut at a depth of 747 metres, and beneath that lies the Centenary-Cut ("the C-Cut"), a world class diamond resource. The mine hosts a total resource of 202.1 million carats, including 16.5 million carats in tailings dumps. 
The mine, previously known as Premier Diamond mine, is renowned for producing many of the world's largest and most famous diamonds, including the Cullinan Diamond, the world's largest gem diamond, at rough. Sir Thomas Cullinan, the former chairman of the Premier Diamond Mine, presented the Cullinan to England's King Edward VII in 1905. The Great Star of Africa, which sits in the Sceptre of the Crown Jewels, was produced from the Cullinan Diamond, and was until recently acknowledged to be the largest cut diamond in the world, weighing in at . In 1985 it lost the record to the Golden Jubilee, which was found in the same mine as the Cullinan and weighed in its polished state. More than a quarter of all diamonds weighing more than have originated from Cullinan. It is also the world's only significant source of blue diamonds. One of these famous large blue diamonds was cut into several stones and made into a necklace which subsequently became known as the Cullinan Blue Diamond necklace. 
The Cullinan mine continues to produce large stones. The Cullinan Heritage, a white diamond, was discovered in September 2009. This stone was the 19th biggest uncut diamond ever found and was sold in February 2010 to Chow Tai Fook Jewellery for $35.5m, the highest price ever paid for an uncut diamond. The previous record was held by Gem Diamonds' Leseli La Letšeng, which was bought for $18.4m by Graff Diamonds in December 2008.
Koffiefontein.
Koffiefontein mine is one of the world’s top diamond mines by average value per carat and produces exceptional white and coloured diamonds, a regular proportion of which are of between 5 and 30 carats. In 1994, a 232.34 carat diamond was recovered at Koffiefontein, being the largest rough diamond ever produced by the mine. 
Diamonds were first discovered on the Koffiefontein farm in 1870. Mining started in the form of small claims that were later amalgamated into Koffiefontein Mine Limited. De Beers acquired control of Koffiefontein Mine Limited in 1911. Mining operations were then continuous until the advent of the Great Depression in 1932 when work was suspended. Between 1950 and 1953, a prospecting shaft was sunk which was followed by limited production. The mine was reopened in 1970 and preparations for increased production were completed in August 1971. Immediately after completing the preparations, production from the open pit commenced and proceeded to a depth of 270 metres. Underground development started in 1974 through a sampling programme. Underground production briefly took place in 1982 but ceased soon thereafter due to the 1981 slump in the diamond market. These operations were resumed in March 1987. During the period 1972 to the end of 2004, approximately 69.5 million tonnes of kimberlite ore were mined and 6.1 million carats of diamonds were recovered. In February 2006, De Beers ceased mining when the old order mining right for Koffiefontein expired and in July of that year Petra Diamonds commenced operating the mine under care and maintenance conditions. The acquisition of the mine was completed in July 2007 and Petra Diamonds was subsequently able to commence diamond recoveries by starting to process the stockpile through the plant.
Kimberley Underground.
Kimberley Underground comprises three kimberlite pipe mines in close proximity: Bultfontein, Dutoitspan and Wesselton. These mines were integral to the economic development of South Africa as their output effectively financed development of the nascent gold industry. They are currently mining at depths of between 845 and 995 metres below surface. The mines have a history of producing large diamonds and fancy yellows, such as the Oppenheimer Diamond (253 carats rough). The largest diamond ever recovered at Kimberley Underground was +800 carats and the mine is also the source of the Kimberley Octahedral, at 616 carats, one of the largest uncut diamonds in the world.
The mines were closed by De Beers in August 2005 and subsequently Petra operated Kimberley Underground under care and maintenance from September 2007. Petra was given approval to operate the mines under De Beers’ licence and the acquisition completed in May 2010.
Fissure Mines.
The Fissure Mines were acquired by Petra when it merged with Crown Diamonds NL in May 2005, introducing producing assets to what had previously been an exploration company. 
Tanzania.
Petra agreed to acquire the Williamson Mine in Tanzania in September 2008 from De Beers and completed the acquisition in February 2009. The Williamson mine, which was discovered in 1940, has a reputation for the production of large, high value diamonds, with special stones (classified as larger than ) produced regularly. The mine is also famed for its pink diamonds. In 1947, the mine's founder Dr. John Williamson presented Princess Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) with a flawless pink diamond (the Williamson Pink Diamond) on her wedding day. The eventual cut diamond became the centre stone in the Williamson Diamond brooch and is supposedly the basis for the Pink Panther diamond in the film of the same name.
The Williamson Mine currently has a resource of 39.6 million carats (8,000 kg) (984 million tonnes of kimberlite). It has an average mining depth of 65 metres (90m at the deepest point) and a very low stripping ratio. Energy and Minerals Minister William Ngeleja said Petra's entry is "an opportunity to breathe new life into Williamson Mine and Tanzania's diamond mining sector."
Botswana.
Petra commenced exploration in Botswana, following the acquisition of Kalahari Diamonds in September 2005. Petra Diamonds Botswana is the holder of approximately 21,519km2 of diamond exploration ground, all of which is "on craton" (the geological formation known to host diamonds). The company's current focus is on the KX36 kimberlite discovery, in the Kukuma East project area, and the potential for further discoveries in the area.

Bangladesh Police

The Bangladesh Police () is the main law enforcement agency of Bangladesh. It is administered under the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of Bangladesh. It plays a crucial role in maintaining peace, and enforcement of law and order within Bangladesh. Though the police are primarily concerned with the maintenance of law and order and security of persons and property of individuals, it also plays a big role in the criminal justice system.
History of Bangladesh Police.
Ancient Period.
The main sources of the Bangladesh Police force's history come from "Manushanghita", which are the hieroglyphics of Emperor Ashoka, and the stories of renowned travellers. In "Orthoshastra" by Koutilla, nine types of spies are mentioned. During that period, policing was confined in the efforts of collecting intelligence in order to curb anti-governmental activities, and to maintain law and order in the society. The duties of spies were varied, such as conducting surveillance over the activities of ministers, civil, and military officials, for which, different means of temptations and instigations were used.
Medieval Period.
Details of policing activities during the middle age are also challenging to find. However, during the periods of the great sultans, an official holding the position of Muhtasib used to perform the duties of policing. This person was the chief of police, in charge of public works, and the inspector of public ethics simultaneously. In urban areas, Kotwals were responsible for performing police duties. The policing system introduced by Sher Shah Suri was further organized during the period of Emperor Akbar: the Emperor organized his administrative structure introducing Fouzdari (the principal representative of the Emperor), Mir Adal and Kazi (the head of judicial department), and Kotwal (the chief police official of larger cities). This system was effective in maintaining the law and order in cities, and was implemented in Dhaka. Many district sadar police stations are still called Kotwali police stations. In the Mughal period, Kotwal emerged as an institution.
A Fouzdar was appointed to every administrative unit of the government (district), under whom there were some artillery and cavalry forces. There was a disciplined police system during the Mughal period, though there was no professional police force like that in the British period. It has been opined that there was a remarkable development in the maintenance of law and order and criminal administration during the reign of the Muslim rulers.
British Period.
In the early stage of the Industrial Revolution, when England was facing grave crisis due to socio-economic transformation, the necessity of an effective organised police service was keenly felt. Sir Robert Peel, the then Prime Minister, introduced a bill in the British Parliament in 1829 which created an organised civil police in London. The success of the London police in controlling social disorder and crime was admired by not only the people of England but also of European and American countries: New York city copied the London model with some modifications when it organised the first Municipal Police Force, in 1833.
In 1858, full control of the Indian Territory was taken over from the East India Company by the British government. The success of the London police organised under Peel's Act of 1829 prompted the British government to reform the police system in the sub-continent in a similar way to British constabularies. With this end in view, a police commissioner was set up 1840, and on the recommendation of the commission of the Police Act (Act V of 1861), was passed by the British Parliament. Under this Act a police force was created in each province of British India, and placed under the control of the provincial government. The administration of the police force of a province was vested upon an officer styled as the Inspector-general of police. The administration of the police in a district was placed under the Superintendentof Police. The Act is still in force throughout the sub-continent, and regulates the function of police in Bangladesh, as well as the other countries of the sub-continent.
Pakistan Period.
After partition of the sub-continent in 1947, the police force in Bangladesh was first named as the East Bengal Police, and then as the East Pakistan Police, however, it continued to function in the same lines as during the British rule.
Role of Police in Liberation War.
In the Bangladesh Liberation War, Bengali-speaking police officers participated with the citizens, leading to deaths from most ranks, fighting with .303 rifles against the Pakistani. The resistance by the Bengali members of police at Rajarbagh is considered the first chapter of armed struggles during the War of Independence. 
Mr. Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Bir Bikram, the Sub-Divisional Police Officer of Jhenaidah at that time, led the guard of honour given to the members of the Mujibnagar Cabinet when the provisional Government of Bangladesh took oath on 17 April, 1971, during the liberation war.
Bangladesh Period.
After the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country on 16 December, 1971, the police force was recognized and assumed the role of a national police force. At present, Bangladesh Police is primarily responsible for the preservation of peace and order, protection of life and property of the people and prevention and detection of crime. The traditional role of police in Bangladesh has undergone change after the liberation: the role of police is no longer confined to maintenance of law and order and prevention and detection of crime, and to meet the need of an independent and developing country, the police are now required to assist in developing the state and such kinds of activities by providing the basic security required for sustained economic growth of the country. It is further playing a vital role in dealing with insurgency in some areas of the country which impedes development activities and threatens the security of the state.
Organisation of Bangladesh Police.
Bangladesh Police is headed by the Inspector General of Police (IGP), under whose command, Bangladesh Police is divided into different branches.
Branches.
Range & District Police.
Outside the Dhaka region, and other metropolitan cities, police is organised into Police Ranges, which are headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), who control several Police Districts. At present, there are seven Police Ranges in seven administrative divisions and two Police Ranges for railways and highways.
Each Police Range maintains its own Range Reserve Force (RRF) and district police also maintains its own Special Armed Force (SAF) which is responsible for emergencies and crowd control issues. They are generally activated only on orders from the Superintendent of Police, and higher-level authorities. The armed constabulary do not usually come into contact with the general public unless they are assigned to VIP duty or to maintain order during fairs, festivals, athletic events, elections, and natural disasters. They may additionally be sent to quell outbreaks of unrest, organized crime, and communal riots; to maintain key guard posts; and to participate in anti-terrorist operations.
Names of the Police Ranges in seven administrative divisions are:
Another two Police Ranges are:
Metropolitan Police.
In addition to the police ranges, major cities have police forces which follow the Police Commissionerate System. The Chief of the Metropolitan Police is the Police Commissioner.

Strength.
As of December 2012, the strength of the Bangladesh Police is approximately 152,000. The Police:Population ratio in Bangladesh is 1:1133.
Community Policing in Bangladesh.
In Bangladesh police, community policing is an organization with the aims of promoting community, government and police partnerships, proactive problem solving, and community engagement to address the causes of crime, fear of crime and community issues. Bangladesh Police have been trying to implement this philosophy nationwide. The Police Reform Program (PRP), a UNDP funded project, has been providing Bangladesh Police with technical assistance to implement community-policing nationwide.
Bangladesh police has been implementing a community policing system, which is very much similar to that of the western style of community policing forum (CPF). Community policing promotes equal partnership between the police and the community, and the Bangladesh Police have identified two tiers of partnerships.
Strategic Partnership.
Under the strategic partnership there are: 
The Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police units and the Range DIGs of the respective police Ranges also have metro or divisional cells of community policing.
Implementation Partnership.
The implementation partnership starts at the district level:
There is a district community-policing cell in every district under the Superintendent of Police. The Additional SP or an ASP looks after the district community-policing cell.
Secondly, in the police station level, there is a community policing cell with a full-time community policing officer (CPO), who coordinates the community policing activities in the police station jurisdiction.
Beat Policing.
Dhaka Metropolitan Police is implementing the beat policing in Dhaka city. In this regard, each Police Station is divided into some police beats, and for each beat there is an assigned Beat Policing Officer.
Women in Bangladesh Police.
Women first joined Bangladesh Police in 1974, when fourteen women police officers were appointed in the Special Branch, pf whom, seven were at the rank of Sub-Inspector, and seven were at the rank of Constable. The first female uniformed police members were recruited two years later, in 1976, when fifteen women police officers were appointed in the Dhaka Metropolitan Police for the first time. They were also at the ranks of Constable and Sub-Inspector. 
In 1986, there was only one serving female woman police officer: Ms. Fatema Begum was appointed as Assistant Superintendent of Police through 6th Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) examination. After two years, in 1988, four women joined Bangladesh Police through the 7th Bangladesh Civil Service examination.

Nest ferch Cadell

Nest ferch Cadell was the daughter of Cadell ap Brochfael, a late 8th century King of Powys, the wife of Merfyn Frych, King of Gwynedd, and mother to Rhodri the Great, King of both Powys and Gwynedd.
On the death of her brother Cyngen ap Cadell in 855, authority over the Kingdom of Powys passed to her son Rhodri the Great who had previously inherited the Kingdom of Gwynedd on the death of his father in 844, thereby uniting the Kingdoms of Powys and Gwynedd. 
It is unclear why the inheritance of Powys passed through Nest to her son, and not to one of the sons of Cyngen: Elisedd ap Cyngen, Ieuaf ap Cyngen, Aeddan ap Cyngen, and Gruffudd ap Cyngen. The texts of Welsh laws which survive to us were written down no earlier than the 12th century, but they provide no evidence that women were capable of transmitting legal title of kingship or lordship. Equally, although the pedigree in a manuscript in Jesus College Oxford states Nest as the mother of Rhodri the Great, another pedigree in a fourteenth-century manuscript in the National Library of Wales records his mother as Essyllt ferch Cynan. There are no strong grounds to accept either manuscript as reliable, but it is reasonable to believe that the royal house of Gwynedd promoted the view that the Kingdom of Powys had passed to Rhodri the Great through his mother in order to legitimise their control over it. Either way, this possible genealogical manipulation became part of the accepted story of the unification of the two kingdoms.
According to J. Morris, she had a second marriage to Gwerystan ap Gwaithfoed after the death of Mervyn Frych.

North of Ireland F.C.

North of Ireland Football Club is a former Irish rugby union club that was based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was the first rugby club formed in what is now Northern Ireland and only two other clubs - Dublin University and Wanderers - were formed earlier anywhere else in all Ireland. It was founded in 1868 by members of North of Ireland Cricket Club. NIFC also played in the first recorded rugby game in Ulster when they played a 20-a-side match against Queen's University RFC. 
Throughout its history, NIFC was one of the most successful clubs in Ulster rugby, winning eighteen Ulster Senior League titles and eighteen Ulster Senior Cup titles. They also played several seasons in the AIB League before merging with Collegians in 1999 to form Belfast Harlequins.
The club left its historic home on the Ormeau Road (one of the earliest international rugby venues in Ireland) after a series of sectarian arson attacks, including the burning of its pavilion. The club, with a mainly Protestant membership, was perceived as being "isolated in a zone of working-class nationalism".

FIBA Africa Championship 2009

The 2009 FIBA Africa Championship (alternatively the FIBA African Championship) was the 25th FIBA Africa Championship, played under the auspices of the Fédération Internationale de Basketball, the basketball sport governing body, and the African zone thereof. At stake were the three berths allocated to Africa in the 2010 FIBA World Championship. The tournament was hosted by Libya after Nigeria, the original host, withdrew from hosting after not conforming to FIBA Africa guidelines.
Angola won its sixth consecutive African championship and tenth overall by beating Côte d'Ivoire 82-72 in the championship game. Tunisia won the bronze medal game over Cameroon to earn its first ever FIBA World Championship berth. Angola, Côte d'Ivoire, and Tunisia move on to represent Africa at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey. Angola's Joaquim Gomes claimed the tournament's Most Valuable Player award for the second consecutive Afrobasket tournament.
Tournament Overview.
Widely considered among the most coveted sporting competitions in Africa, the 2009 FIBA Africa Championship was hosted by Libya from August 5 to August 15, 2009. Games were played in Tripoli and Benghazi, with four groups being equally divided between the country’s two largest cities.
It is estimated that over 70 media channels covered the engagements, with the top three positioned squads automatically qualifying to represent the continent for the 2010 World Championship, to be held from August 28 to September 12, in Turkey. This historic event also coincides with ongoing celebratory activities marking the 40th anniversary of Libya's 1 September Revolution (Great Al-Fatih Revolution) which brought Muammar Gaddafi to power, and the tenth anniversary of the Sirte Declaration establishing the African Union (AU) on September 9, 1999.
Host Selection Process.
Libya's selection as the host country was decided by the Fédération Internationale de Basketball (FIBA) Executive Committee, approved by the Central Board of FIBA Africa, and officially announced in Tripoli on February 7, 2009. The decision favoring Libya to organize the 25th edition, followed the withdrawal of Nigeria who failed to conform to FIBA Africa guidelines. Signing of the official contract was conducted at a ceremony at Tripoli’s Corinthia Bab Africa Hotel on February 4, 2009, in the presence of Libya’s National Olympic Committee president Mohammad Al-Amariy, Dr. Muhammad Gaddafi, and president of the Libyan Arab Basketball Federation (LBF), Omar El Barshushi.
Before reaching the contract signing stage, and after Nigeria’s withdrawal, an organizing committee was formed by FIBA to investigate the facilities Libya had to offer regarding basketball courts and the possibility of refurbishing sites. At the 4th Session of FIBA-Africa Central Committee meeting in Cairo, Egypt on January 25, 2009, the Libyan organizing committee presented plans and the preparation undertaken in order to successfully host the championships. The Central Board members who also made their recommendations approved the LBF presentation, which has been an FIBA Africa affiliate since 1961, and were described as excellent. The president of the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) invited FIBA Africa’s officials in Tripoli to view first hand Libya’s preparations. To this end, before signing the contract between FIBA Africa and LBF, the Secretary General of FIBA Africa, Dr. Alphonse Bilé, the Assistant Secretary General, Adel Tooma and the President of the Commission for Competitions, Raouf Menjour, checked thoroughly the facilities and basketball courts that will serve the event and gave their approval.
Venues.
Two Libyan cities, Benghazi and Tripoli hosted games in the tournament. Benghazi hosted games in Groups A, B, and E. Tripoli hosted games in Groups C, D, and F, in addition to the knockout round games.
Games in Tripoli were held in the African Union Arena, a modern, 7,000 seat arena built in the capital city in 2006. Games in Benghazi were held in the Suliman Ad-Dharrath Arena, part of the Medina al-Riyadhia (Sports City), the city's largest sporting centre. The 10,000 seat arena was built in 1967 and is therefore quite outdated; however, the stadia has undergone maintenance work in recent years.
Qualification.
Participants were sixteen national basketball teams among the 53 FIBA Africa members. These teams included the host nation, the top three sides at the FIBA Africa Championship 2007 in Angola, one wild card, and the top eleven sides at the 2009 Zone preliminary basketball competitions. None of the countries in Qualification Zone 7 registered for the qualifying tournament, so a second wild card was added. 14 of the 16 teams that competed for the 2007 Championship returned, with host Libya and Congo replacing Liberia and DR Congo. The following national teams competed:
Format.
A revised format will debut in the 2009 championship:
Squads.
Each of the sixteen teams competing was eligible to field a squad of twelve players for the tournament. Only Cape Verde and host Libya did not take advantage of this limit, as both teams sent an 11-man squad to the competition.
Results.
Preliminary Round.
The draw was held on June 26, 2009 in Libya.
All times are in local time UTC+2
Group A.
Group A went according to form, as African powerhouse Nigeria was rarely challenged in the group en route to going undefeated. Côte d'Ivoire grabbed the second eighth final spot out of Group A by winning its last two group games after losing its tournament opener to the Nigerians. Host Libya, making its first tournament appearance since 1978, won its tournament opener over South Africa. This was enough to qualify for the eighth final round as last place South Africa lost its last two games by a combined 85 points.
Group B.
Five-time defending champion Angola surprisingly struggled in its first two games, slipping by Mali by 5 after ending the game on an 8-3 run, and beating Egypt after trailing at the half. Angola again found themselves tied at the half against Mozambique before finally hitting their stride in outscoring their opponents 60-17 in the second half. Mali took control in the second half against Egypt to finish second in the group; both teams advanced by virtue of their victories over last place Mozambique.
Group C.
2005 silver medalists Senegal and 2007 silver medalists Cameroon both cruised to victories in their first two games to qualify for the eighth final round. Senegal won a hard-fought two point victory over Cameroon in the final group game to grab first place in the group. Central African Republic thrashed over-matched Congo 113-61, in what amounted to an elimination game between two 0-2 teams on the last match day, to grab the final eighth final spot out of Group C.
Group D.
Group D was the most tightly contested preliminary round group. These games resulted in the most surprising result of this stage of the tournament as defending bronze medalists Cape Verde were eliminated even after their opening victory over Tunisia in spite of the efforts of Jeff Xavier, who would finish as the tournament's leading scorer. Group D also saw one of the best games of the tournament, as Morocco's Mohamad Hachad single-handedly shocked Rwanda when he hit a three-pointer with 29 seconds left, then stole the ball and passed to Yunss Akinocho for a jumper to erase a four-point lead in an 85-84 victory. Tunisia and Morocco both advanced with victories on the final day of group play after no team had clinched a spot in the eighth final coming into the final games. Rwanda also advanced by virtue of its ten point victory over Cape Verde.
Eighth Final Round.
Group E.
Group E went according to form as defending champion Angola continued its undefeated run in the tournament by dismantling Libya and Côte d'Ivoire in its first two games. Nigeria followed suit, albeit in less than dominating fashion, by slipping by Egypt and Mali to set up a showdown in the final group play match with Angola. Nigeria hung with the defending champions in a hard-fought game that was close the whole way, but the Nigerians could not close the deficit below two in the fourth quarter en route to a 93-85 loss.
Mali coasted to two easy victories over Côte d'Ivoire and Libya to finish third in the group. Côte d'Ivoire pulled away from Egypt in the fourth quarter to grab the final quarterfinal spot of the group. Egypt lost all three games, including a humiliating 75-73 loss to Libya on Raed Elhamali's buzzer beater. This was the first time in 19 appearances at the FIBA Africa Championship that the Egyptians failed to qualify for the semifinals.
Group F.
Unlike Group E, Group F was filled with back-and-forth matches between all six teams. Day 1 of the group saw plenty of action. Rwanda, making only its second tournament appearance, stunned 24-time participant Senegal, which had been undefeated in group play. Tunisia followed that up with a one-point victory over Central African Republic on Amine Rzig's jumper with four seconds left.
On Day 2, Central African Republic returned to form with a dominating 21-point victory over Rwanda. Senegal was upset yet again when Mouhammad Faye missed two free throws with three seconds left in a 75-73 loss to Morocco. Tunisia again won in dramatic fashion with a 68-66 victory over Cameroon when Parfait Bitee missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.
Heading into Day 3, only Tunisia had clinched a quarterfinal spot. Senegal rebounded from two consecutive losses to beat Tunisia and steal first place in the group from the Tunisians. Despite losing to Rwanda, Cameroon finished third in the group. Central African Republic beat Morocco to claim the final quarterfinal spot.
Knockout Round.
The knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament involving the eight teams that qualified by finishing in the top four of their group in the eighth final stage of the tournament. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were: quarter-finals, semi-finals, final. There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. Each finalist and the winner of the third place game would qualify for the 2010 FIBA World Championship.
Quarterfinals.
In the first game of the quarterfinals, Angola closed the third quarter on a 23-6 run en route to an 84-63 victory after Central African Republic had tied the game at 43 early in the second half. The Angolans qualified for the semifinals for the 14th consecutive Afrobasket tournament. Tunisia won a thriller over Mali 74-73 when Mali star Amara Sy missed the second of two free throws with one second on the clock. In the third quarterfinal, Cameroon never trailed in the second half to stun Nigeria, whose only previous loss had come at the hands of Angola. Group E fourth-place finisher Côte d'Ivoire followed the previous game with a shocker of their own in beating Group F first place Senegal. The Ivorians dominated the beginning and end of the game after the team jumped out to a 16-2 first half lead and closed the game on a 16-6 run en route to a six point victory.
Semifinals.
In the semifinals, Tunisia hung with the powerhouse Angolans for much of the game. The Tunisians never trailed by more than eleven in the fourth quarter but could not cut the deficit lower than five en route to a ten point loss. In a match-up between the two teams that pulled quarterfinal upsets, Côte d'Ivoire continued its Cinderella run with a victory over Cameroon. The Ivorians closed the game on an 8-0 run in the final two minutes to turn a 61-60 deficit into a 68-61 victory to qualify for the team's first FIBA Africa Championship final since 1985.
Third-place playoff.
In a game that would decide the third and final African qualifier for the 2010 FIBA World Championship, Tunisia never trailed in winning the bronze medal game over Cameroon in dominating fashion. Tunisian star and All-Tournament First Team selection Amine Rzig scored a game-high 20 points.
Final.
Angola won its sixth consecutive African championship after withstanding a valiant challenge from the upstart Côte d'Ivoire team. Côte d'Ivoire took a surprising one-point lead into the half and kept the game close through the second half as the eventual 10-point margin of victory matched Angola's biggest lead in the game.
Classification Round.
5th-8th places.
In the consolation bracket for quarterfinal losers, Central African Republic continued its strong run in the tournament following an 0-2 start in beating Mali 80-74. In a match-up that most expected would take place in the semifinals, Nigeria regained its preliminary round form in dismantling Senegal in the second game.
Nigeria grabbed fifth place over the Central Africans in an uneventful game. Senegal defeated Mali in the seventh place game to end a disappointing tournament with a 5-4 record after starting the tournament 3-0.
9th-12th places.
In the consolation bracket for eighth final losers, surprising Rwanda continued its strong run in its second ever Afrobasket tournament by finishing ninth and improving on last year's twelve place finish. Egypt finished tenth with a 2-6 record, by far its worst performance in a FIBA Africa Championship. The host Libyans finished in a strong eleventh place for a team making its first appearance in an Afrobasket tournament since 1978 on the strength of Hesham Ali Salem's 25-point, 14-rebound performance in the eleventh place game.
13th-16th places.
In the consolation bracket for opening round losers, Cape Verde finally showed the form that won them the bronze medal at the FIBA Africa Championship 2007 in destroying Congo and Mozambique by 37 and 33 points, respectively. Against Congo, Cape Verde star Jeff Xavier scored a tournament-high 38 points. Mozambique slipped by South Africa 69-67 to grab its only win of the tournament en route to a 14th place finish. In the 15th place game, South Africa claimed its only victory of the tournament and sent the over-matched Congo team home winless.

Steven Benson (murderer)

Steven Wayne Benson (born July 26, 1951) is a convicted double murderer of his mother, tobacco heiress Margaret Benson; and his brother (actually his nephew but later adopted), tennis player Scott Benson. (Margaret Hitchcock Benson was heiress of the Lancaster Leaf Tobacco Co., Lancaster, Pa., and had no connection with Benson & Hedges brand cigarettes manufactured in the US by Philip Morris.)
On July 9, 1985 Benson placed a car bomb on the family car, in which Margaret, Scott, and Steven's sister, Carol Lynn Benson Kendall, (a former Miss Florida runner-up) were waiting for Steven to join them in the vehicle when the Suburban exploded. Kendall survived but was badly burned; Margaret and Scott died instantly from the bomb impact. Represented by attorney Michael McDonnell, Steven Benson was ultimately convicted of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, arson of a dwelling. He avoided the death penalty, and was sentenced to life in prison. Benson has been transferred to different prisons during his time, because of constant threats and abuse from other prisoners. Because of the murder, Benson was attacked by other prisoners while serving his sentence in prison.

<doc id="19522141" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19522141" title="Directed listening and thinking activity">
Directed listening and thinking activity

The directed listening and thinking activity (DLTA) is a strategy that was first identified by Stauffer (1980). It is used with early childhood students or students who are not yet successful independent readers. Teachers use this strategy to establish a purpose for reading with their students. With the use of this strategy students can become engaged in a text that they could not otherwise read on their own. Students are prepared to listen to a story that will be read by their teacher by being given specific information that they are to focus on as they listen. The strategy utilizes pre-reading, reading, and post-reading questions and discussions. Teachers use this strategy in an attempt to build on the knowledge that students already know and apply it to new information and situations. Students are provided with a framework to organize and recall information from storybooks. The directed reading and thinking activity is a very similar strategy that can be applied once this strategy is mastered and students become more advanced, independent readers.
Purpose.
Students need to be explicitly taught strategies for the comprehension of a story. The purpose of this strategy is to give the students skills so that they can eventually internalize reading skills such as, setting purposes for reading and summarizing what they have read. As a result of continuously using this strategy in the classroom students should develop metacognition of their own reading abilities and as a result a better comprehension, understanding, and connections to texts.
Procedure.
Preparing for reading.
The first step in the directed listening and thinking activity is to prepare the students for the read aloud by introducing the story and making predictions. The teacher can do this in several ways; one way is by leading the students through a book walk of the story. This means that the teacher does not read any of the words but flips through each page and lets the students look at the pictures. After they see all the pictures they can then make some predictions about what they saw. The teacher can also have the students look at just the title and the cover and use it to help them make predictions. It is very important for the teacher to accept all predictions that are given. Students need to feel comfortable taking risks in their classroom environment. To establish this level of comfort they must know that their opinions are valued. All predictions should be recorded to come back to after the story has been read.
The teacher will then ask pre-questions, which activate prior knowledge and set the purposes for reading the story. These questions will try to connect with the students’ real-life experiences when possible. They will also relate to the main themes in the story and the objectives for reading. At this time, the teacher is establishing the purpose and what students should be thinking about as the story is read.
Reading the story.
The teacher now begins to read the story. It is important to make sure that students can see all of the illustrations. The teacher should stop one or two times to discuss the story and to ask the students which previous predictions were correct. Students should also continue to make predictions at a few points in the story as well. It is important not to ask too many questions while reading the story. To help students to focus attention on the story, it is better to wait until after reading it through once to ask most of the questions about the students’ reactions, comments, and questions.
Discussion after reading.
This is the final part of the directed listening and thinking activity. At this time there should be a discussion between the students and the teacher that is connected to the objectives and purposes for reading that were originally established. For example, if the skill that was established was sequencing the students will need to recall information about the order of the events in the story. The end is a way to tie together the skills that the students were focusing on and to summarize what they have learned as a result of listening to the story. If the students do not respond to particular questions that are asked about the story it is the teacher’s responsibility to model or scaffold their responses. This can be done by asking a question in a different or simpler way or by giving the student more information. This should also be a time to go back to the predictions that were initially listed and revise and discuss them. After the teacher has discussed the story and the objectives as a group an independent activity can be done to assess what the students have learned.
Reading objectives.
There are a wide range of objectives that you can use with this strategy. Basically any skill that pertains to the text can be employed. Examples of the different types of skills that the directed listening activity can be used to enhance are: literal information such as, sequencing and recalling facts, inferential responses such as, interpreting the feelings of characters, making predictions, relating story events to real-life experiences and visualizing, or critical responses such as, evaluating and problem solving. The strategy can also be used with various genres and story structures. However, it is important to remember that the three steps to using this strategy are always the same:
Conclusion.
In a study conducted by Morrow (1984) children scored higher on comprehension tests when this strategy was utilized in the classroom because of its focus on many skills that are important to good readers. The study also proved that the modeling and scaffolding used by the teacher during this technique better prepared students to understand unfamiliar texts. When this strategy is used in classrooms it will allow students to better comprehend and connect with the texts that are being read to them. If this strategy is done correctly and frequently it will bring students more independence and reading readiness. It will lead to the creation of more engaged and skilled readers who possess the ability to think critically and analyze the texts that they have read.

1952–53 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1952-53 campaign was Town's first season back in the 2nd Division since the 1919-20 season. Under the leadership of Andy Beattie, Town returned to the top flight at the first attempt. They finished in 2nd place behind Sheffield United by 2 points, with 58 points. The main reasons for Town's success during the season were the 45 goals between Jimmy Glazzard and Vic Metcalfe. Also, 7 of Town's players (Jack Wheeler, Ron Staniforth, Laurie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Don McEvoy, Len Quested and Vic Metcalfe) played every game in the season, while Jimmy Glazzard missed just the last game of the season.
Review.
Andy Beattie's first full season in charge of the Terriers had one simple objective - return Town to the top flight as soon as possible. The start of the season saw Town go on a 10-match unbeaten run, abruptly ended by a defeat at home to Nottingham Forest in early October. This was then followed by 5 consecutive wins, followed swiftly by 2 consecutive losses to Leicester City and West Ham United. Town's form continued to improve with Town only losing 5 more matches between December and the end of the season on May 1.
The main reason for Town's success was their defence which remained unchanged all season. The 6-man defence of Jack Wheeler in goal, protected by Ron Staniforth, Laurie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Don McEvoy and Len Quested only let in 33 league goals all season, 22 less than champions Sheffield United. Vic Metcalfe played every game as well, while 30-goal Jimmy Glazzard just missed the final game against Plymouth Argyle, luckily his replacement Roy Shiner scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win, which cemented Town's second place finish, guaranteeing their return to Division 1 after one season out.

Central European Chamber Orchestra

The Central European Chamber Orchestra is a Vienna-based Chamber Orchestra founded in 2005. It came into being due to the enthusiasm and adventurous spirit of students. Many of the original young musicians have matured into excellent instrumentalists, committed composers, experienced arrangers, and promising conductors.
As the orchestra is composed of artists from vatious countries, and with different musical and educational backgrounds, it made it possible for the orchestra to have a great deal of flexibility in terms of its repertoire—classical-romantic repertoire, New Music and Jazz). The expertise of young "all-rounders" was used to the greatest extent possible. In addition to its work on pieces from the classical repertoire, the orchestra aims at establishing close co-operation with artists with backgrounds in the performing arts and visual arts, as well as with artists from the contemporary Viennese dance scene.
The mission of the orchestra is to establish itself as a regionally significant musical entity which does not see Vienna as its sole area of activity, but rather as an important regional centre, the focal point of a realm of Central European culture which transcends national borders. The Central European Chamber Orchestra has given two international guest performances in China, where the careful introduction of interesting, extravagant pieces, resonated well with the audience.

Empire of the Sun (band)

Empire of the Sun are an Australian electronic music duo from Sydney, formed in 2008. The duo consists of longtime collaborators Luke Steele of alternative rock act The Sleepy Jackson, and Nick Littlemore of electronic dance outfit Pnau. 
Their award-winning, 2008 debut album "Walking on a Dream" shot the duo to international success and to date has been certified double platinum in Australia and gold in United States. The album has sparked a number of internationally charting singles including "Walking on a Dream" which peaked at number ten on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and reached number sixty four on the UK Singles Chart, and "We Are the People", which peaked at number fourteen on the UK Singles Chart.
The duo's second album "Ice on the Dune" was released on 14 June 2013 in Australia, and was preceded by lead single "Alive" on 16 April. They are currently signed to EMI Australia and Virgin UK.
History.
Formation.
Luke Steele and Nick Littlemore met in 2000 after being introduced by Steele's A&R executive, Simon Moor, in a bar in Sydney. Both were at the time signed to EMI and had already been working on their own independent projects. Although they did not initially capitalize on their instant creative chemistry, the two consistently collaborated over the years. Littlemore helped write the song "Tell the Girls That I'm Not Hangin' Out", which appeared on The Sleepy Jackson's 2003 debut album, "Lovers", and Steele had artistic input in Littlemore's 2006 art-rock project Teenager. 
The two officially reunited together for two songs on Pnau's self-titled album "Pnau" in 2007—"Freedom" and the opener "With You Forever". Littlemore commented "when Mayes and I wrote 'With You Forever', I knew straight away I had to send it to Luke. A day later, he called me up and sang the whole thing over the phone to me." Luke Steele's contribution to the track was so influential to Nick and Pete that they scrapped over 200 songs worth of material for the album, and began to craft a work more vocally-centered than they ever had before. A track-by-track analysis of the album "Pnau" by Nick and Pete reveals that writing "With You Forever" with Luke Steele was such an exciting experience that it directly inspired the two to begin work on another project together. Littlemore said, "We fell in love with music again with You Forever; I think this is [Pnau's] first great song." The release of "Pnau" unexpectedly brought acclaim from music icon Elton John, who, after befriending Littlemore, became involved in some of the early planning of Nick and Luke's new project.
The new project began to develop into what would later become Empire of the Sun (under the working title of Steelemore). As Steele was living in Perth at the time and Littlemore was in Sydney for the next few months the pair independently continued to write songs for the project and organized meetings in Sydney where they decided on the album's musical direction and style. Eventually the pair went into the studio with Peter Mayes to record the final material, all of which was entirely produced by themselves.
Although the name of the project has been attributed to the 1984 novel of the same name by J. G. Ballard, Littlemore denies this and offers an explanation, saying, "the name comes more from the idea of (and you'll see this in the ongoing videos) the fact that we're traveling around the world going to all the places of empires of the civilization where the sun has been a theme of worship. It's not based on the Ballard novel nor the Spielberg film of the same name."
2008–11: "Walking on a Dream".
After several months of consulting on the material for the album, Littlemore and Steele went into the studio to record their debut album. Titled "Walking on a Dream", the album was released on 3 October 2008. Prior to its release six tracks were put up on the social networking site Myspace for fans to listen to.
The album debuted at number eight on the ARIA Albums Charts and eventually peaked at number six. The album's lead single, "Walking on a Dream", was released digitally on 30 August 2008. The single received airtime from many Australian radio stations and has since reached number ten on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. The second single released from the album, titled "We Are the People", peaked at number twenty-four in Australia. In September 2009 this song was used in an American advertising campaign for Vizio televisions. The third single, "Standing on the Shore" was released on iTunes on 12 June and for general release on 23 June. The video was filmed in Lancelin in April 2009. "Without You" was released as the album's fourth single.
Critical response to the album was generally positive, generating a score of 60 on the review aggregator Metacritic. Martin Robinson in his review for "NME" described their debut as "silly but their songs demand to be taken seriously, just like Prince, Ultravox and Bowie. And yes, they're like MGMT – in that they're great." Under the Radar also rated it favourably describing it as "a highly visual experience". "Rolling Stone Australia" awarded the album a positive 3.5 out of 5, describing it as "gorgeously plaintive electro-pop", but noted "the gold is harder to find in the record's hazy second half".
Critics with mixed reactions largely expressed their discontent with the album's second half, particularly marked by the unsettling introduction of the fifth track, "Delta Bay". Mike Orme of Pitchfork Media claimed that "few buzzes die so abruptly as in the transition of the complex, ethereal melodies of 'We Are the People' into the following cut 'Delta Bay', which sounds like 'Thriller' sung by cats." PopMatters made a similar comment that "We Are the People" "proves the duo's talent for making great music... it's just unfortunate the song bleeds into 'Delta Bay'... why would you want to do that?" Dorian Lynskey of "The Guardian" rated "Walking on a Dream" 3 out of 5 stars, explaining "the slick, pastel-wardrobed MOR of the title track and We Are the People demonstrate melodic agility and sun-dazzled charm" but that the album as a whole is "a ripe cheese, best not consumed whole."
2013–onwards: "Ice on the Dune".
On 11 March 2013, Empire of the Sun revealed the debut trailer for their upcoming second album "Ice on the Dune"—the trailer was produced by Kelvin Optical, Inc., a production division of Bad Robot, and was directed by J.D. Dillard. The album's release date was revealed as June 2013. The newly launched website for the album featured placeholder links for upcoming content, with dates allocated for 15 March, 22 March, 29 March, and 8 April. 
The lead single "Alive" was released on 16 April and on the same day, the album was made available for pre-order on iTunes. The music video for "Alive", also produced by Kelvin Optical, Inc., was directed by Charles Scott and Alex Theurer. On 18 April 2013, the Farrelly brothers announced that the band will score "Dumb and Dumber To".
"Ice on the Dune" was released on 14 June 2013 in Australia and New Zealand. Following the release of the second album, Littlemore revealed details about a potential film in a June 2013 interview:
We've written a treatment for film but I guess we're just waiting for that person with a sackful of money to come along and pay for it. We hope there'll be a film somewhere down the road and a Vegas-style show. We want to do it properly with animals and everything. We've always wanted elephants and tigers.
Steele received global media attention following an interview he completed with music publication "NME" in August 2013 at the Sziget Festival in Budapest. During the interview, Steele compared "Ice on the Dune" with Daft Punk's 2013 album release "Random Access Memories", stating: "They had a great marketing campaign, but we’ve got better songs."
Touring.
On 22 July 2009, Empire of the Sun made a special broadcast in conjunction with the solar eclipse that occurred on that day, which included a sneak preview of their forthcoming performance at the Parklife Festival in Australia. Luke Steele performed "Breakdown" and "Swordfish Hotkiss Night".
Contrary to previous suggestions that they would remain a studio band, Empire of the Sun performed live, alongside Lady Sovereign and La Roux, at Australia's Parklife Festival during September/October 2009.
In September 2009 Luke Steele revealed that his Empire of the Sun bandmate Nick Littlemore had been missing for five months and that he would also be performing a series of upcoming shows in the duo's native Australia solo. Asked whether Littlemore was still a member of the band, Steele said: "I really don't know, hey, he's just left me with the baby." However on 26 November 2010, Littlemore, in an interview with internet music site The Music Network, said, "I talked to Luke (Steele) the other day; we're doing a new record. We've already written a couple of tunes. You know when it's right I guess."
In July 2011, Littlemore announced that Empire of the Sun had gone into the studio at the end of June to begin working on a second Empire of the Sun album. In an interview with Confidential, he explained that he and Steele had not, as reported, fallen out, but that Littlemore had been heavily involved in writing music for Cirque du Soleil and was therefore unable to tour. However, while playing a track from the new album to the interviewer, Littlemore confirmed he would "come on board this time, actually come together and tour."
Media appearances.
In the UK, they gained fourth position on the BBC News website's Sound of 2009 poll.
Empire of the Sun appeared for the first time in a Triple J Hottest 100 with two entries in the 2008 countdown: "We Are the People" at number sixty-eight and "Walking on a Dream" at number four. 
"Walking on a Dream" had been nominated as Song of the Year at the 2009 Australian Performing Rights Association awards.
Empire of the Sun were nominated for six awards at the 2009 ARIA Awards. They were nominated for Album of the Year, Single of the Year, Best Group, Best Pop Release, Best Selling Single and Best Selling Album, winning all but the Best Selling awards. Luke Steele also performed "Walking on a Dream" at the event. Empire of the Sun also received an additional 5 nominations (for Producer of the Year, Engineer of the Year, Best Video and Best Cover Art) as part of the Artisan Awards section of the 2009 ARIA Awards, the winners of which were announced on 10 November, prior to the official ceremony. They won all but 2 of these awards, one nomination of which (for "We Are the People") was in the same category (Best Video) they won in for "Walking on a Dream".
In October 2010, "We Are the People" was used as the soundtrack for a Vodafone TV commercial in Germany and subsequently topped the German Singles Chart.
"We Are the People" is included on the soundtrack for the 2011 film "The Roommate" and "Walking on a Dream" is included on the soundtrack for the 2011 film "Hall Pass".

The Galileo Galilei planetarium, commonly known as Planetario, is located in Parque Tres de Febrero in the Palermo district of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
History.
The idea that Buenos Aires should have a planetarium began to take shape in 1958 by an agreement between Socialist Councilman José Luis Peña and the municipal Secretary of Culture, Dr. Aldo Cocca.
Construction began under the direction of architect Enrique Jan in 1962, and it was inaugurated on December 20, 1966. The first function was carried out on June 13, 1967 for the students of "Escuela Comercial Nº 1" of Banfield and "Santa Unión de los Sagrados Corazones" of Capital Federal. Professor of geography and mathematics Antonio Cornejo showed them the sky over Buenos Aires, Argentine Antarctica and the South Pole, as well as demonstrating the orientation of the southern cross. The facility was officially opened to the public on April 5, 1968.
Structure.
The building has five floors, six staircases and a diameter room with 360 seats. The inside of the 20m semispherical dome is covered with reflective aluminium. 
The planetarium (Zeiss Model M V) itself is located in the centre, it has over 100 projectors and is approximately in height and 2.5 tons in weight. It consists of a cylindrical framework with independent projectors for the Moon, the Sun and the visible planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and two spheres in the extremes that project 8,900 stars, constellations and nebulas.

Tommy Northcott

Thomas Theodore "Tommy" Northcott (born 5 December 1931 in Torquay, died 26 September 2008) was an English professional footballer. Although he played for several clubs during his career, Northcott is particularly remembered for his time at Torquay United, where he is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats and Lincoln City where he was voted as one of their 100 league legends in 2006. He played twice for England at Youth level, against Scotland and Wales.
Career.
Northcott was from the Barton area of Torquay and began his career with local club Hele Spurs before joining his hometown Football league club Torquay United on his 17th birthday. He made his debut in April 1949 against Northampton Town. Within two years he had established himself in the Torquay side and for a short time had a successful forward line partnership with Sammy Collins. 
He also completed his apprenticeship as a plumber and did his National Service before signing for Cardiff City in October 1952, as part of an agreement between the club and Torquay that Cardiff received first option on their players in exchange for regular loan deals. He was put straight into the side and over the following three seasons he established himself in the First Division, scoring some vital goals for the club. 
He left Cardiff in July 1955 to sign for Lincoln City for a fee of £3000, making his debut on 20 August 1955 against Blackburn Rovers. He scored twenty times that season, taking over as the Imps' main striker when Andy Graver was sold to Stoke City, and spent three years with Lincoln before deciding to return to the South-West of England. Despite interest from both Exeter City and Plymouth Argyle, Torquay manager Eric Webber secured Northcott's services in November 1957 for a fee of £5,000.
He again teamed up with Sammy Collins, but also played alongside his younger brother George, a central defender. He scored 13 times during the remainder of the 1957–58 season, twenty the following season and 15 in the 1959–60 season as Torquay won promotion to the Third Division. In 1963 Torquay signed Robin Stubbs from Birmingham City and Northcott quickly established a fruitful relationship with him. The pair scored over 100 goals over the next three seasons and in 1966 helped Torquay to promotion back to the Third Division. However, he was released by manager Frank O'Farrell at the end of that promotion season.
He joined non-league Bridgwater Town and playing alongside former Torquay teammate Ernie Pym helped Bridgwater to the Western League title in 1968. He later played for Barnstaple Town, before ending his career in local football.
On retirement from Football, Northcott ran a plumbing and central heating business in Torquay, but spent his last few years suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. 
He died in Torquay in September 2008 from Alzheimers, leaving his widow, Margaret, three daughters, one of whom married Torquay defender Peter Darke, five granddaughters and a great grandson. His funeral at Torquay Crematorium was marked by a long period of applause and attendees included a number of his former teammates, his former manager Frank O'Farrell and Torquay's current board of directors.

With the naval minister Georges Leygues he tried to get government funding priority for naval re-armament in coastal defence and the fleet, but many of the projects they initiated were delayed or cancelled due to priority instead being given to Army projects such as the Maginot Line (since Germany was seen as the main enemy and thus land re-armament as the priority). He did, however, preside over the opening of new docks and a deep-water basin at Le Havre on Bastille Day 1928, shortly after also presiding over a naval review at the port.

Addison Hutton

Addison Hutton (1834–1916) was a Philadelphia architect who designed prominent residences in Philadelphia and its suburbs, plus courthouses, hospitals, and libraries, including the Ridgway Library (now Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts) and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. He made major additions to the campuses of Westtown School, George School, Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Lehigh University.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Addison Hutton was born on November 28, 1834. He grew up in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, southeast of Pittsburgh. He was the son of Joel Hutton, a Quaker carpenter, and Ann Mains. At an early age, he became fond of the "solid necessities of building" and enjoyed working alongside his father. Like his father, Addison would vary between carpenting and school. A young man named Robert Grimacy gave him lessons in architecture; it was then that Addison Hutton considered it to be a possible direction in his own life.
Career.
Addison Hutton studied architecture with Samuel Sloan, who was a leading Philadelphia architect and author of books on house designs. He supervised construction of the Sloan-designed Longwood in Natchez, MS (1859–62), until construction was abandoned during the American Civil War (stranding Hutton, a pacifist, in the Deep South). He became Sloan's partner in 1864 and was able to bring numerous commissions to their office due to his Quaker connections. By 1868, he had established his own office.
In November 1901, the American Institute of Architects denounced the design competition for the Pennsylvania State Capitol at Harrisburg and strongly urged its members not to participate. Hutton was one of nine architects who submitted designs (his was not selected), and he was expelled from the AIA in February 1902.
Marriage and children.
On October 10, 1865, Addison married Rebecca Morris, daughter of Philadelphia industrialist Israel Morris. They had one child, a girl named Mary, who was born September 1, 1869; Mary married Jame Garrett Biddle. In 1876, Hutton built a house for his family in Bryn Mawr, PA, near those of several of his clients. It still stands at the southwest corner of Montgomery and Morris Avenues.
Death and afterward.
Addison Hutton died on June 26, 1916, and was buried at Short Creek Meeting House, Jefferson Co., Ohio. His granddaughter has written a biography: Elizabeth Biddle Yarnall, "Addison Hutton: Quaker Architect, 1834–1916" (Philadelphia: The Art Alliance Press, 1974).

Tagmar

Tagmar is a roleplaying game (RPG) launched in 1991 by GSA that claims to be the first such Brazilian offering on what was at the time a nascent market.
The game was a typical early 1990s RPG but featured a series of innovations, the main one being that it was a self-contained package with everything necessary to play provided in a single book: rules, setting, magic, creatures and a pre-prepared adventure for beginners. At the time, RPG books were imported to Brazil and it was necessary to have several to play a game.
Based on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, Tagmar faced accusations that it was based on Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), especially from "Dragão Brasil" magazine, at the time edited by Marcelo Cassaro, while others claimed that is was very different. Due to a variety of factors including price, availability and innovation, such as the unprecedented concept of "Heroic Energy", in a short time Tagmar became a success and gathered a large fan base.
During the 1990s, the "world" of Tagmar was enlarged through the publication of complementary books such as the "Creatures Book" ("Livro de Criaturas") and "The Empire" ("O Império"). These books provided details on the appearance, skills and habitat of the creatures of Tagmar as well as information about new geographic regions.
This success continued until 1997 when the publisher GSA closed down leaving Tagmar to stagnate.
Renaissance.
In September 2004, the original authors of Tagmar met and decided to release the commercial rights of the RPG on a non-profit basis. The "Tagmar II Project" then brought together a group of people to create the new version. This project was based on open gaming using the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license whereby all creative and development work was done by volunteers with two main objectives:
At the beginning of the 90s, Tagmar was considered one of the leading RPGs but the game did not follow the trends of other RPGs. As the Tagmar II Project began, a work plan was developed to address the following issues in the original game:
Following one year's development work, Tagmar version 2.0 was released in September, 2005. In March, 2006, version 2.1 added more rules and delivered the long-awaited expanded setting with the launch of the Book of Kingdoms. The current version, Tagmar 2.2 was launched in July, 2007 and brings increments to the professions of Bard and Tracker, an expanded and comprehensive Book of Creatures as well as numerous improvements to the rules.
Published material.
Currently, Tagmar 2 has an extensive list of published titles that can be downloaded for free from the official site. Among these are:

Solar Probe Plus

Solar Probe Plus or Solar Probe+, previously NASA Solar Probe, is a planned robotic spacecraft to probe the outer corona of the Sun. It will approach to within 8.5 solar radii (0.034 astronomical units or 5.9 million kilometers or 3.67 million miles, roughly 1/8 of the perihelion of Mercury) to the 'surface' (photosphere) of the Sun. The project was announced as a new mission start in the fiscal 2009 budget year. On May 1, 2008 Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory announced it will design and build the spacecraft, on a schedule to launch it in 2015. The launch date has since been pushed back to 2018.
Trajectory and mission.
Early conceptual designs for the Solar Probe mission used a gravity assist maneuver at Jupiter to cancel the orbital angular momentum of the probe launched from Earth, in order to drop onto a trajectory close to the Sun. The Solar Probe Plus mission design simplifies this trajectory by using multiple gravity assists at Venus, to incrementally decrease the orbital perihelion to achieve multiple passes to approximately 8.5 solar radii, or about .
The mission is designed to survive the harsh environment near the Sun, where the incident solar intensity is approximately 520 times the intensity at Earth orbit, by the use of a solar shadow-shield. The solar shield, at the front of the spacecraft, is made of reinforced carbon-carbon composite. The spacecraft systems, and the scientific instruments, are located in the penumbra of the shield. The primary power for the mission will be by use of a dual system of photovoltaic arrays. A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside of 0.25 AU, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain operating temperature.
As the probe passes around the Sun, it will achieve a velocity of up to at that time making it the fastest manmade object ever, almost three times faster than the current record holder, Helios II.

Arthur Elvin

Sir Arthur Elvin MBE (born 5 July 1899 Norwich, England - 4 February 1957) left school at the age of fourteen. After a few different jobs joined the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War. Elvin was shot down over France and was a prisoner of war for two years. He died at sea whilst on a trip to South Africa.
Wembley Stadium.
In 1924 He was working at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in a cigarette kiosk. The following year he decided to buy his own shops within the grounds, eight for a total of £100. By the end of the Exhibition he had made over £1000 profit from his shops.
At the end of the exhibition a buildings entrepreneur bought the grounds and Elvin became a buildings demolition contractor to clear the site. He bought the derelict buildings one by one and sold off the scrap. Wembley Stadium went into liquidation at the end of the Exhibition after it was pronounced "financially unviable". Elvin offered to buy the stadium for £127,000, using a £12,000 downpayment and the balance plus interest payable over ten years.
After complications following the death of the original owner, Elvin bought Wembley Stadium at the agreed price with the new owners, (Wembley Company) who honoured Elvin's original deal. They then immediately bought it back from Elvin leaving him with a healthy profit. Instead of cash he received shares which gave him the largest stake in Wembley Stadium and he became chairman.
Wembley Arena.
In 1934 Elvin opened the doors to a new indoor multipurpose sports arena alongside the main stadium at Wembley. The Empire Pool and Sports Arena was built for the 1934 British Empire Games. It was later renamed the Wembley Arena
Greyhound racing.
The first sport Elvin introduced to the stadium was greyhound racing. Elvin had noted the popularity and success of greyhound racing at the Bellevue race track in Manchester and recognised the sport as a good business proposition. The opening meeting was in 1927 and 50,000 people attended to watch the first race won by a greyhound named Spin. The dog racing provided the stadium with its main source of regular income, especially in the early days, and continued to attract crowds of several thousand up until the early 1960s.
Speedway.
In 1929 Elvin decided he wanted to operate a speedway team from the stadium. With the help of speedway promoter Johnnie Hoskins, he constructed a speedway track at a cost of £250,000. Elvin announced that the Wembley Lions would enter the new Southern League. The Speedway World Championship was held at Wembley Stadium from 1936 until 1960 and then seven times more afterwards. The ashes for the speedway track were supplied by Richard Biffa Ltd who's operating base at the time was in Wembley Hill Road. Richard Biffa later became Biffa Waste Services. 
The stadium saw a crowd of 85,000 for the first World Final in 1936 while the largest crowd was for the 1981 World Final when some 92,500 saw the last final held at the great stadium. For one Lions' league meeting in 1948, against the West Ham Hammers, it witnessed a crowd of 85,000 inside and another 20,000 outside unable to get in.
Ice hockey.
The Empire Pool and Sports Arena was housed two teams, the Wembley Canadians (later called the Wembley Monarchs), and the Wembley Lions. In 1990 he was inducted into the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.
Honours.
Arthur Elvin was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1945 and received his knighthood from King George VI in 1947 for the efforts in staging the 1948 Olympic Games.

Anders Lindström

Anders Lindström or Boba Fett as he is often called is a Swedish rock musician most known for being the organist and pianist of the Swedish rock band The Hellacopters and co founder and guitarist of The Diamond Dogs.
Life and career.
Lindström founded The Diamond Dogs along with vocalist Sören 'Sulo' Karlsson in the early 1990s; Lindström was the band's guitarist and released four albums with the band. During this time he also worked as a recording engineer for various bands including some early Hellacopters reordings. Lindström later joined The Hellacopters after the band's grammis award-winning debut album "Supershitty to the Max!" to play the organ and piano. After the departure of guitarist Dregen, vocalist and guitarist Nick Royale handled lead guitar while Lindström temporarily played rhythm guitar during the recording of "Grande Rock" before Robert Dahlqvist joined as their full-time guitarist. During the band's hiatus after the release of the album "By the Grace of God", Lindström rejoined his old band Diamond Dogs to record "Black River Road" in 2004.
In 2005, The Hellacopters returned with "Rock & Roll Is Dead" which would become their last full-length album of their own material. Lindström also formed The Bitter Twins along with former bandmate Sulo to celebrate their 20th anniversary of playing music together. The initial idea was to play the depressive type of music they originally played 20 years ago, however the music sounded more like The Clash in the late 70s and early 80s. The duo also called in guest musicians such as Papa Dee, Magnus Carlson from the Weeping Willows, Mattias Bärjed from The Soundtrack of Our Lives and Stefan Björk formerly of Wilmer X. In late 2007, The Hellacopters announced that they would be breaking up after the release of their cover album "Head Off" and the following "Tour Before the Fall", which ended with four gigs in two days in late October 2008. After The Hellacopters brek-up Lindström worked with front man Nicke Andersson's new band Imperial State Electric.
Lindström is also a recreational fisher and together with bands such as The Hives, Backyard Babies, Millencolin, Weeping Willows, Randy he and The Hellacopters contributed with music for the charity album "Ge Fan i Våra Vatten" to raise money to help save the northern pike and the Atlantic salmon. Recently Lindström worked with Weeping Willows front man Magnus Carlson on soundtracks for several Swedish film projects that have not yet been released.

Holy Cross College (Dublin)

Holy Cross College (also known as Clonliffe College), located in Clonliffe Road, Drumcondra was founded in 1854 as the Catholic diocesan seminary for Dublin by Cardinal Paul Cullen (1803–78)
In 1861 Rector of the Catholic University Dr Bartholomew Woodlock tried to secure land in Clonliffe west to build a new Catholic University, however this plan was shelved due to the expansion of the Railway line. Plans were draw up by the Architect J.J. McCarthy for the proposed new University, McCarthy a famous architect designed the college building.
Following the 1879 University Education (Ireland) Act which incorporated the Royal University of Ireland the Catholic University of Ireland was reconstituted as to comprise all Catholic Colleges including Holy Cross College, Clonliffe. Students would sit exams for the Royal University. Since the royal university was prohibited in awarding degrees in theology, the Catholic University would confer degrees in theology and divinity, such as BD and DD.
In 1882 the Catholic University of Irelands Library (excluding medical books) was transferred from what became University College Dublin to Clonliffe.
Holy Cross College, Clonliffe, the Dublin Diocesan Major Seminary, had been granted power to confer some of the Degrees of the Angelicum University of Rome, students would be award degrees such as BD or STB from the Angelicum.
Seminarian students would have also taken studies in University College Dublin and many "walked in procession" between Clonliffe and Earlsfort Terrace, prior to it moving out to Belfield.
The National University of Ireland, Maynooth validates a number of diplomas and certificates conducted at clonliffe.
In 2001 saw the seminary duties suspended due to a fall in vocations, with students for the priesthood for the diocese being transferred to national seminary in St Patrick's College, Maynooth.
Today.
The College is adjacent to the residence of the Archbishop of Dublin, just north of Croke Park Stadium. Clonliffe is the administrative headquarters of the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, and is used for retreats, meetings and courses. A number of Dublin Diocesan bodies are based in Clonliffe College such as Crosscare which is located in the Red building. The Mater Dei Institute of Education College of Education was established in 1966 on part of the Clonliffe College campus, uses some of the resources of the former seminary such as the Sports grounds.
Archives.
The College houses the archives of Dublin Diocese but also many other documents such as those of Daniel O'Connell's Catholic Association and Repeal Association and religious artefacts. The archive contains the papers of eleven Archbishops of Dublin, a number of auxiliary bishops and of Dr. Bartholomew Woodlock the second president of the Catholic University of Ireland. The College is participating in Culture Night 2013 where its archives and artwork will be on display to the general public, as well as recitals of music and a talk on the 1913 Lockout.
People associated with Clonliffe College.

Pom Pom (film)

Pom Pom (神勇雙響炮; lit. "Supernaturally brave artillery") is a 1984 Hong Kong action comedy film directed by Joe Cheung. It is the first in a series of four Pom Pom films starring Richard Ng and John Shum.
The title of the film is the onomatopoeic representation of a gunshot sound. The title is sometimes suffixed with an exclamation mark - "Pom Pom!". The alternate Hong Kong English title for the film is "Boom Boom!".
The film is something of a spinoff of Sammo Hung's "Lucky Stars" films, and Hung produced "Pom Pom" and released the film through his Bo Ho Films production company. Ng and Shum had been two of the original quintet of Lucky Stars in the film "Winners and Sinners" and their co-stars in that film, Hung, Charlie Chin and Stanley Fung make cameo appearances in "Pom Pom" as their "My Lucky Stars" characters, released in the following year.
Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, who had appeared in the original Lucky Stars trilogy also made cameo appearances as a motorcycle cop and truck driver respectively. The film also features appearances from several of their Hong Kong action film contemporaries, including Deanie Yip, Lam Ching Ying, Philip Chan, Dick Wei and Wu Ma.
Plot.
Ah Chau (Richard Ng) and Beethoven (John Shum) are a pair of cops investigating a drug lord, but their ineptitude threatens to derail the case.
The police are well aware that Mr Sha (Chan Lung) is the boss of the crime syndicate smuggling and trafficking in drugs, and that he keeps details of his criminal transactions in a book which is kept by his mistress. When Beethoven and Ah Chau investigate, they find Sha's mistress dead, and inadvertently compromise all fingerprint evidence in the hideout. Luckily, they are assisted by beautiful cop Inspector Anna (Deannie Yip), who is secretly attracted to Ah Chau. Finally the two make their arrests and become instant heroes.
Sequels.
Pom Pom was followed by 3 sequels:

Iain Cheeseman

Iain Cheeseman investigates the role of the kinetochore, a group of proteins required for cell division and chromosome segregation. This core network of proteins facilitates the attachment of chromosomes to microtubule polymers—the spindle structures that attach to the ends of cells, pulling and dividing them during cell division. The kinetochore is critical to ensuring duplication without loss or damage to the genetic material. Cheeseman is also investigating the activities of the individual molecular machines that make up this structure and how these proteins are controlled and regulated.
Cheeseman is noted for discovering multiple new kinetochore proteins within yeast, the Caenorhabditis elegans worm and human cells. He has focused particularly on the proteins that are required to generate connections with spindle microtubules. He recently demonstrated a critical and direct role for a protein complex called Ndc80 (coded for by the gene NDC80) in directly associating with microtubules.
Because many cancers may be driven by errors in chromosome segregation, it is hoped that Cheeseman’s studies will provide payoffs in cancer research. Certain cancer drugs target the connection between chromosomes and spindle microtubules, and some of the major proteins in the kinetochore complex have been implicated in leukemia and other diseases.
Cheeseman is currently a junior Faculty Member at Whitehead Institute and an Assistant Professor at MIT. He did his undergraduate training at Duke University, and his graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a doctorate in 2002. Cheeseman carried out his postdoctoral work in the lab of Arshad Desai at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in San Diego and the University of California, San Diego.

The Sleepy Time Gal

The Sleepy Time Gal is a 2001 film written and directed by Christopher Munch. The film stars Jacqueline Bisset, Martha Plimpton, Nick Stahl, Amy Madigan, Seymour Cassel and Frankie Faison.
Plot.
Frances (Jacqueline Bisset) has enjoyed a variety of jobs during her adult life and is the mother of two sons, each by a different husband. She also gave birth to a daughter following an affair she had with a married man, but was forced by her mother to give up the baby for adoption. Frances attempts to search for the child she gave away, but she is diagnosed with cancer before she is able to conduct a thorough search. As Frances is attended by one of her sons (Nick Stahl) and a nurse (Amy Madigan), she is unaware that her lost daughter, who is now a corporate lawyer (Martha Plimpton), is conducting her own search for her missing birth mother. Part of her search takes her to a Daytona Beach, Florida, radio station where Frances worked years ago as a late-night disc jockey under the moniker of the Sleepy Time Gal.
Production.
"The Sleepy Time Gal" was the third film directed by Christopher Munch, whose previous work included "The Hours and Times" (1991) and "Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day" (1996). Munch shot the film over a two-and-half year period, and he later told an interviewer the extended stop-and-start shooting schedule was dictated by the lack of finances. "I didn't have a big enough chunk of money at any one point to do the whole thing," he said. "It really was held together by chewing gum and a lot of care."
Munch also stated the inspiration for "The Sleepy Time Gal" was based on his mother's experience in giving birth to a baby girl out of wedlock and giving the infant away for adoption. But unlike the characters in his film, Munch made no attempt to actively locate his long-lost half-sister.
Distribution.
"The Sleepy Time Gal" was first shown at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. However, it was not acquired by a major distributor for theatrical release. Later that year, it was cited by the Village Voice in its annual survey of the year's best undistributed films. The film had a television premiere instead of a theatrical debut, with a debut broadcast on the Sundance Channel on March 29, 2002. 
After its television broadcast, "The Sleepy Time Gal" had several commercial theatrical playdates across the U.S. When the film played in New York City in May 2002, film critic Dennis Lim of the "Village Voice" praised Bisset’s acting, citing a “candid and complex performance that for all its gossamer, death-haunted poetics…conveys the irreducible weight of a singular life.” When the movie played in Chicago in November 2002, "Chicago Sun-Times" critic Roger Ebert praised Munch's screenplay for being “tenderly observant of his characters.”
"The Sleepy Time Gal" was released on DVD on January 28, 2003, by Sundance Home Channel Entertainment.

The Pirate Bay raid

The Pirate Bay raid took place on 31 May 2006 in Stockholm, when The Pirate Bay, a Swedish website that indexes torrent files, was raided by Swedish police, causing it to go offline for three days. Upon reopening, the site's number of visitors more than doubled; the increased popularity attributed to greater exposure through the media coverage. The raid, alleged by Pirate Bay to be politically motivated and under pressure from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), was reported as a success by the MPAA in the immediate aftermath, but with the website being restored within days and the raising of the debate in Swedish culture, The Pirate Bay and other commentators considered the raid "highly unsuccessful". On 31 January 2008, Swedish prosecutors filed charges against four of the individuals behind The Pirate Bay for "promoting other people's infringements of copyright laws".
Execution.
At roughly 11:00 am UTC on 31 May 2006, a major raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place, prompted by allegations of copyright violations and formally ordered by judge Tomas Norström, who later presided on the 2009 trial. Some 65 police officers participated in the raid, shutting down the website and confiscating its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ. The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay. Three people—Gottfrid Svartholm, Mikael Viborg, and Fredrik Neij—were held by the police for questioning, but were released later in the evening. Mikael Viborg, the legal advisor to The Pirate Bay, was arrested at his apartment, brought in for questioning, forced to submit a DNA sample and had his electronic equipment seized.
All servers in the server room were seized, including those running the website of Piratbyrån, an independent organization fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities, including a Russian opposition news agency. In addition, equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and faxes were also seized. The Danish documentary "Good Copy Bad Copy" (2007) includes closed-circuit television camera footage of the raid, and interviews with Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij about the raid and its aftermath.
Political issues.
The Swedish public broadcast network, Sveriges Television, cited unnamed sources claiming that the raid was prompted by political pressure from the United States, which the Swedish government denied. Sveriges Television claimed that the Swedish government was threatened by the World Trade Organization with trade sanctions unless action was taken against The Pirate Bay. 
There have been claims of politicians pressuring other government agencies to take action in connection with this allegation, which is unconstitutional in Sweden. A letter titled "Re: The Pirate Bay" from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to Dan Eliasson, State Secretary at the Swedish Ministry of Justice, was dated two months before the raid and hinted at trade reprisals ("It is certainly not in Sweden's best interests to earn a reputation as a place where utter lawlessness is tolerated") and urged him to "exercise your influence to urge law enforcement officers in Sweden to take much needed action against The Pirate Bay". 
The MPAA wrote in a press release: "Since filing a criminal complaint in Sweden in November 2004, the film industry has worked vigorously with Swedish and U.S. government officials in Sweden to shut this illegal website down." MPAA CEO Dan Glickman also stated, "Intellectual property theft is a problem for film industries all over the world and we are glad that the local government in Sweden has helped stop The Pirate Bay from continuing to enable rampant copyright theft on the Internet." The MPAA press release set forth its justification for the raid and claimed that there were three arrests; however, the individuals were not actually arrested, only held for questioning. The release also reprinted John G. Malcolm's allegation that The Pirate Bay was making money from the distribution of copyrighted material, a criticism denied by the Pirate Bay.
Aftermath.
After the raid, The Pirate Bay displayed a "SITE DOWN" message confirming that Swedish police had executed search warrants for breach of copyright law or assisting such a breach. The BitTorrent community quickly spread the announcement across online news sites, blogs, and discussion forums. The closure message initially caused some confusion because on 1 April 2005 The Pirate Bay had posted a similar message, stating that they were permanently down due to a supposed raid by the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau and IFPI, as a prank. Piratbyrån set up a temporary news blog to inform the public about the incident.
On 1 June 2006, it was reported on The Pirate Bay website that it would be up and fully functional within a day or two. As promised, The Pirate Bay was back up and operational by the end of the next day, their logo now depicting the pirate ship firing cannon balls at the Hollywood sign. The header displayed the name "The Police Bay". The next logo featured the pirate ship as a stylized phoenix, in reference to the servers rising up again after the raid.
The reincarnated website was, as stated by "Peter" in the Chaosradio International interview with Tim Pritlove, running on servers located in the Netherlands. As of 3 June, the search function was not available. It was possible to browse for .torrent files manually and download them, but attempts at downloading .torrent files for most copyrighted materials gave 404 Not Found errors. On 5 June 2006, The Pirate Bay went down, citing database server problems. It was back up the next day, but with limited availability. The Pirate Bay attributed these issues to increased traffic resulting from the recent publicity, and promised that the website would soon be running smoothly again. TPB thereafter fixed a number of minor software bugs and brought new servers online to handle the increased traffic load. By 9 June, the website was once again fully functional. On 14 June 2006, the Swedish newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" reported that The Pirate Bay was back in Sweden due to "pressure from the Department of Justice the Netherlands."
During the afternoon of 1 June, again on 3 June, and again in the morning of 4 June, the website of the Swedish police went down due to high load. It was speculated that this was a retaliatory denial-of-service attack in response to the TPB raid. According to a Swedish article in the IT news website IDG, the downtime resulted from many requests for a specific url—which had been widely circulated via IRC chatrooms and internet forums. According to the article, the purpose was to "show what you think of the police's behaviour."
Demonstrations against the police action took place on 3 June 2006 in Gothenburg and Stockholm, organized by Piratbyrån and the Pirate Party in collaboration with the Liberal Youth, Young Greens and Young Left parties. There were no reports of violence. Approximately 500–600 people showed up at the Stockholm protest and about 300 at the Gothenburg protest.
The Pirate Bay is considered part of an international anti-copyright movement. The documentary "Steal This Film" was produced and distributed (via BitTorrent) in the months following the raid. In the words of its speakers, it aimed to present the other side of the debate, until that time dominated by the media industry. The film was made available free, as donationware. 
Since the raid, Pirate Bay stated their disaster recovery plan of "a few days" worked correctly, but that they are now moving to redundant servers both in Belgium and Russia, and an aim of a few hours restoration time, should the servers be disrupted again. Following the raid the number of Pirate Bay users grew from 1 million to 2.7 million. The number of peers grew almost 5 times, from 2.5 million to 12 million. It has been reported that the Pirate Bay claims more than 5 million active users. Internet traffic ranker Alexa.com ranks Pirate Bay as the 73rd most popular website in the world.
Charges.
In May 2007, prosecutor Håkan Roswall made it clear that he intended to press charges against the administrators of The Pirate Bay. In mid-January 2008 Peter Sunde told Ars Technica: "I'm quite sure we won't be convicted anyhow" and "we are, we'll just appeal all the way to the European Union court. So in five years time this might be settled." 
On 31 January 2008, Pirate Bay operators Fredrik Neij, Per Svartholm Warg, Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström were charged with "promoting other people's infringements of copyright laws." If convicted, the defendants face up to two years in prison and SEK 1.2 million in restitution. Pirate Bay's legal advisor, Mikael Viborg, has stated that because torrent files and trackers merely point to content, the site's activities are legal under Swedish law. Magnus Martensson, legal advisor for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), says the website is damaging to industry and liable for at least contributory copyright infringement.
Allegations.
Soon after the police investigation of The Pirate Bay finished in 2008, the lead investigator, Jim Keyzer, according to Keyzer's since-deleted Facebook profile, left the police force briefly to work for MPAA member studio Warner Brothers. Sydsvenskan reported that Keyzer had already been working for the studio while the investigation into The Pirate Bay was still open. An April 2008 Pirate Party press release called the potential conflict of interest a "bribing scandal". Piratbyrån wrote about the allegations:
These matters have not been resolved in court and even though Keyzer was scheduled to be a witness in the Pirate Bay trial, he was not called.

At age 17, Eliot signed a multi-record deal with Island Records. Eliot spent six months writing and recording her debut album "The Constant" in Sweden with one of her two producers, Klas Åhlund. According to his manager, Christian Wåhlberg, Åhlund had been keen to work with Eliot because he saw the "punk rocker" in her. The electropop sound of her debut album was influenced by Island president Darcus Beese, with Wåhlberg saying that if Eliot had signed to a different label then the music she created with Åhlund would have sounded differently. I Blame Coco's debut single for Island, "Caesar", featuring Robyn, was released in February 2010. Eliot released her follow-up single entitled "Self Machine" on 12 July 2010.

David Gill (film historian)

David Ian Gill (9 June 1928 – 28 September 1997) was a British film historian, preservationist and documentarian who documented the history of motion pictures and helped restore many early, silent films. 
He was born in Papua New Guinea, the son of Cecil Gill, a missionary doctor. His uncle was the sculptor Eric Gill. The family returned to England in 1933 where Gill attended the Belmont Abbey School, Hereford.
Gill died at his home in Huntingdon, England, aged 69, after a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Pauline, and two daughters.
Career.
Gill was trained as a dancer and joined Britain's Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet in 1946, appearing in "The Sleeping Princess", which opened in Covent Garden that year. In 1953, he married dancer Pauline Wadsworth, who later taught at The Royal Ballet School.
Gill left ballet in 1955 to work in television, producing his mime play, "The Way of the Cross", for the BBC before joining Associated-Rediffusion as an editor. He moved to Thames Television in 1968, working mainly on news and documentaries for, amongst others, the "Today" and "This Week" programmes.
Whilst at Thames, he met film historian Kevin Brownlow, with whom he was to work as co-director and producer on several projects including Brownlow's classic book on silent Hollywood, "The Parade's Gone By", "Hollywood – The Pioneers" (1980) and a theatrical presentation of Abel Gance's epic "Napoléon", which was performed in 1980 at the Empire, Leicester Square. Brownlow and Gill formed their own company, Photoplay Productions in 1990, in order to continue their restoration work and documentaries on silent cinema. Among the 25 films they restored are "Ben Hur", "The Phantom of the Opera", "The Thief of Bagdad" and "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse".
Gill's unexpected death, in September 1997, came as he was planning a series of archival films on dance and working on the 1997 Channel 4 Silent, which was to take place at the Royal Festival Hall later in the year.
Documentaries.
His documentaries on Vietnam, South Africa and Northern Ireland were broadcast on the British series "This Week."

1985 Winchester 400

The 1985 Winchester 400 motor race, the sixteenth annual (run yearly since 1970), was held under American Speed Association sanction on September 29, 1985, at the Winchester Speedway, in Indiana (USA).
After coming close on several occasions, 1985 saw Mark Martin finally captured his first "Winchester 400" crown. After passing the ill-handling car of Dick Trickle on the 338th lap, Martin flew to the $13,615 victory that was the largest in the history of the event. He was the first driver since Bob Senneker in 1977 to win the "400" from the pole.
The race.
Martin led the initial 93 laps from his pole position starting spot, before making his first pit stop of the day when a blown tire by Jim Sauter brought out the first caution. His dominance on and off the track was so strong, that the Batesville, AR native never ran lower than fifth during the 200-mile grind. His good fortune was not shared by two-time defending pole winner Dick Trickle and former winners Mike Eddy and Bob Senneker. Eddy managed to finish on the lead lap despite a spin on lap 177, but lost second spot late in the race to a charging Harold Fair. Trickle ran strong, but blew a tire and hit the backstretch wall, eventually dropping to a tenth-place finish. Senneker, who started the race with a broken rib, blew an oil line on lap 111 and hit the first turn wall to end his day. Alan Kulwicki was among the front-runners until a broken spindle forced his Ford into the pits for a lengthy stop on lap 267.
Fair led the race for the first time following Martin’s first stop on lap 93, until Trickle shot by to lead laps 105-217. Fair then went back in front for 13 laps before Trickle again assumed the point. Trickle relinquished the lead on lap 286 when John Wilson hit the fourth-turn wall to bring out a caution. As Trickle cruised down pit road, Eddy and Martin remained on the track and move to the top-two spots. The lead duo made their final stops on lap 318 with Martin winning the race off pit road. Back under green, Martin quickly chased down Trickle and made what would be the pass for the win on lap 338. Fair finished a career-best second ahead of Eddy, Bobby Dotter, and Butch Miller.

The Chaos Experiment

The Chaos Experiment – also billed before release as The Steam Experiment – is a 2009 independent suspense thriller directed by Philippe Martinez and starring Val Kilmer, Armand Assante, and Eric Roberts.
Plot.
A deranged man calling himself James Pettis (Val Kilmer) approaches the Grand Rapids Press demanding that it publish his predictions about the upcoming demise of civilization due to the conditions of global warming, warning that he has trapped a group of six people in a Turkish-style steamroom to demonstrate the effects of this environment on humans. A local police detective Mancini (Armand Assante) tries to get Pettis to reveal information that will help him confirm the truth of his story, and to rescue the hostages, but over the course of the interrogation begins to suspect that either Pettis' story is a delusional hoax, or that the steamroom killing has already taken place. 
As Pettis describes developments in the streamroom to Mancini, the scene is shown of three men and three women meeting in the steamroom of a luxury hotel as part of an online dating promotion, then being locked in there together. When they discover that they have been locked in, they react badly: Frank (Quinn Duffy) becomes abusive to Jessie (Eve Mauro), and is killed in her defense by openly neurotic Margaret (Cordelia Reynolds). Jessie is killed with a nail gun by an unseen assailant when she pokes her head through the small window in the steamroom door; Christopher (Patrick Muldoon) is injured in the hand with a nail as the window is boarded over from outside. Margaret becomes agitated and commits suicide. Grant (Eric Roberts) is bludgeoned by Catherine (Megan Brown) after he accuses her and Christopher of being allies of the perpetrators, and repeatedly holds her head underwater.
Mancini's call to Pettis' psychiatrist finally brings staff from the local state psychiatric hospital, from which Pettis recently escaped. It is revealed that Christopher and Catherine are staff at this facility, and are unhappy with Pettis for going to the news media and police with this story.
Production.
Taking advantage of economic incentives for filming in Michigan, the script was revised to set the story in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Filming took place over four weeks in September 2008, including scenes at the offices of "The Grand Rapids Press", the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel, the Grand Rapids Public Museum, and other downtown locations. The budget for the film was $7 million.
The shots of skyscrapers are actually of the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.
Reception.
The film had a limited theatrical release, playing to small audiences on two screens for one week in Grand Rapids, and for one week in nearby Lansing.

Google Moderator

Google Moderator is a Google service that uses crowdsourcing to rank user-submitted questions, suggestions and ideas. It was launched on September 25, 2008. The service allows the management of feedback from a large number of people, who can vote for the top questions that they think should be posed and ask their own. The service aims to ensure that every question is considered, lets the audience see others' questions, and helps the moderator of a team or event address the questions that the audience most cares about.
Google Moderator was developed by Google engineers Dave S. Young, Taliver Heath, and Colby Ranger in their 20% time, led by project manager Katie Jacobs Stanton.
In December 2008, Google Moderator was used by the President-elect Barack Obama's transition team in a public series called "Open for Questions", in which they answered questions from the general public. The first series ran for less than 48 hours and attracted 1 million votes from 20,000 people on 10,000 questions. The second series ran for just over a week and attracted 4.7 million votes from 100,000 people on 76,000 questions. In January 2009, Obama appointed Stanton to the newly created position of Director of Citizen Participation.
