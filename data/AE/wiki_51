List of preserved steam locomotives in Germany

No.
Reckahn
This list of preserved steam locomotives in Germany makes no claim to being complete. While there are many surviving examples of several locomotive classes, some are in a very poor condition. Thus the list includes partly dismantled or badly corroded locomotives, the technical condition of which cannot really be accurately conveyed in their descriptions.
In many cases the names of organisations, societies and museums have been translated in line with Wikipedia practice. However where they have a standard abbreviation in German, this has been retained. For example the German Railway History Company ("Deutsche Gesellschaft für Eisenbahngeschichte") is abbreviated to "DGEG", its normal (German) abbreviation. In either case the link leads to the English Wikipedia article where both English and German names are given. In addition the following common German abbreviations are used:
Special locomotives.
Replicas of historic engines, that cannot be grouped into a specific class.
Locomotives that can be grouped into the classification scheme.
Class 01.
The Class 01 locomotives were the first production series standard express train locomotives in the Deutsche Reichsbahn. They were of the 4-6-2 or "Pacific" type.
Class 01.5.
The Class 01.5 were reconstructed DRG Class 01 express locomotives ("Rekoloks") reclassfied by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR.
Class 01.10.
The Class 01.10 were standard express train locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The Class 01.10 was an evolutionary development of Class 01 with 3 cylinders and streamlining. On the introduction of computerised (EDP) numbers, the coal-fired locomotives were renumbered to the 011 series and the oil-fired versions to 012.
Class 03.
The Class 03 engines were built between 1930 and 1937 as express locomotives for routes that were only suitable for axle loads up to 18 tonnes.
Class 03.0-2.
The low weight of this locomotive, which was based on the DRG Class 01, was achieved by using a light bar frame, smaller boiler and smaller cylinders. From running number 03 123 the pumps were located in the middle of the vehicle and from number 03 163 the locomotives had larger leading wheels. All locomotives had 2 cylinders.
Class 03.10.
The Class 03.10 was an evolutionary development of the Class 03, comparable to the locomotives of Class 01.10,which were derived from Class 01. Class 03.10 were three-cylinder locomotives equipped with full streamlining on delivering.
Class 05.
Class 05 locomotives were standard express train locomotives of the Deutsche Reichsbahn with full streamlining. Three engines were built, number 05 002 achieved a world speed record for rail vehicles at over 200 km/h.
Class 10.
The Class 10 were express locomotives and the last class of steam locomotives built by the Deutsche Bundesbahn. They were intended to replace the Class 01 and 01.10s. Only 2 units were built.
Class 15.
Before 1925, the Class 15 engine was classified as S 2/6 with the Royal Bavarian State Railways. This 4-4-4 locomotive was specially designed in 1906 as a one-off for express train testing.
Class 17.
Class 17 was assigned to 4-6-0 Express passenger locomotives of the various "Länderbahnen" (state railways)
Class 17.0.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped 2 very similar state railway express locomotive classes into DRG Class 17.0-1: nos. 17 001 – 17 135 (the Prussian S 10) and nos. 17 141 – 17 143 (the LBE S 10)
Class 17.10.
Class 17.10 was assigned to the Prussian S 101.
Class 18.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped those express train, tender locomotives with an axle arrangement of 2'C1' (Pacific), taken over from the state railways, into Class 18. In addition, locomotive number 18 201 is also included in this class. The remaining locomotives in the Deutsche Reichsbahn of the GDR incorporated into Class 02 on the change-over to computerised numbers.
Class 18.3.
The class IV h locomotives of the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway (Deutsche Reichsbahn Class 18.3) are express locomotives with an axle arrangement of 2'C1' (Pacific).
Class 18.4–5.
The steam locomotives of Bavarian class S 3/6, DRG Class 18.4–5, were express locomotives with the axle arrangement 4-6-2 (Pacific). 
Class 18.6 (DB).
In the 1950s the Deutsche Bundesbahn carried out a modernisation of much of its locomotive fleet. This included the conversion of 30 examples of Class 18.5 by the firms of Krauss-Maffei and Henschel. This involved the Reichsbahn locomotives procured roughly between 1927 and 1930 of Bavarian S 3/6 series l to o, that were reclassified into DB Class 18.6. 
18 201.
Locomotive number 18 201 of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) emerged in 1961 at the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Meiningen as a conversion of the Henschel-Wegmann train locomotive, number 61 002, the tender of 44 468 and parts of H 45 024. 
Class 19.
The DRG Class 19 were eight-coupled express train tender locomotives with a 1′D1′ axle arrangement taken over from the Royal Saxon State Railways.
Class 22.
The Class 22 were passenger train locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany, that were converted from former 39.0-2 engines between 1958 and 1962, as part of the reconstruction programme and were renumbered in 1970 under the new computer-generated numbering scheme back to Class 39.10. Several Class 22 boilers were also reused for Class 03.10 locomotives.
Class 23.
The DRG had two examples of the DRG Class 23 "Einheitslokomotive" built, but it was not until after the Second World War that it went into series production with an improved design as the DB Class 23 and DR Class 23.10.
Class 23.10.
In the course of the changeover to computerised numbers the Class 23.10 became Class 35.10.
Class 24.
The locomotives of the Class 24 were standard passenger train locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn.
Class 34.
In Class 34 of the Deutsche Reichsbahn are grouped state railway, passenger train tender locomotives with an axle arrangement of 1'B.
Class 34.742-744.
Class B IX of the Royal Bavarian State Railways were the first express locomotives in Bavaria.
Class 35.
On the introduction of computerised numbering in 1970, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) grouped all its Class 23.10 steam engines into Class 35, renumbering them accordingly..
Class 38.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped all the passenger train tender locomotives with two leading carrying axles and three coupled axles taken over from the state railways, into its Class 38.
Class 39.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn arranged the tender-equipped passenger train locomotives of the Prussian state railways Class P 10 into DRG Class 39 .
Class 41.
The Class 41 were standard goods train locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The computer numbers 042 were for DB locomotives of the Class 41 with oil-firing, but not grouped with Class 42.
Class 42.
The goods train locomotives of the Class 42 built from 1943 onwards were the second, heavy class of so-called war locomotives ("Kriegslokomotiven") ("KDL 2"), intended for duties on routes that were cleared for a higher axle load. Further locomotives were built and sold by LOFAG after the war.
Class 43.
The Class 43 was the second Reichsbahn locomotive class to be built on standard locomotive ("Einheitslok") principles. These two-cylinder locomotives were delivered by Henschel and Schwartzkopff. Several DB Class 44 locomotives were also given computer numbers beginning with 043, but were not part of DRG Class 43.
Class 44.
The Class 44 were standard goods train, steam locomotives with three cylinder engines. Both the DB and the East German DR converted some of the engines to oil-firing, the DB ones being recognisable from their 043 computerised numbers. 20 DR locomotives were fitted with the "Wendler" coal-dust firing system. Several DR locomotives were used as heating engines after being reconverted from oil to coal, but were not given 'coal numbers'; here the last known EDP running number is listed.
Class 45.
The Class 45 locomotives, built by the firm of Henschel between 1936 and 1937, were the most powerful, standard goods train locomotives in the Deutsche Reichsbahn.
Class 50.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn built more Class 50 standard, goods train locomotives than any other class of engine. A total of 3,164 were built between 1939 and 1948.
Class 50.35.
Between 1958 and 1962 the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) had 208 locomotives of Class 50 fitted with newly designed boilers with a mixer-preheater, larger evaporative heating areas and improved suction draught. They were given the designation Class 50.35 and running numbers 50 3501 - 50 3708. Some time later, several locomotives of the series were also converted to oil-firing (BR 50.50) and renumbered to DR "50 00xx-x".
Class 50.40.
The 88 goods train locomotives of Class 50.40 of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) were a new design in parallel with the DR Class 23.10 passenger train locomotives.
Class 50.50.
Between 1966 and 1971, 72 Class 50.35 engines were given oil-firing by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany. To distinguish them they were grouped into a new class, Class 50.50. On the introduction of the EDP numbers in 1970 they were given running numbers 50 0001 - 50 0072. 
Class 52.
The DRG Class 52 was the most numerous of the so-called "Kriegslokomotiven", with more than 6,700 units being produced.
Class 52.80.
The DR Class 52.80 was a series (52 8001 - 52 8200) of "Rekoloks" constructed from the Deutsche Reichsbahn’s fleet of Class 52s in East Germany. They were converted from the old stock in a similar manner to the Class 50.35 around 1960 and fitted with more powerful boilers.
Class 52.90.
In the early 1950s, 25 DRB Class 52 locomotives were converted to "Wendler" brown coal firing at RAW Stendal. On the introduction of the computerised numbers they were grouped into sub-class 52.90.
Class 55.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped all ex-state railway, eight-coupled, goods train, tender locomotives with no carrying wheels into their Class 55.
Class 55.0-6.

Class 55.16-22.
Class 55.16-22 comprised the Prussian G 8 locomotives built between 1902 and 1913 by various manufacturers. They were the first superheated, goods train locomotives in Prussia.
Class 55.25-58.
The Class 55.25-58 were the former Prussian G 8.1 locomotives built between 1913 and 1921, a stronger and heavier evolutionary development of the Prussian G 8, that was initially classed as a "strengthened standard class". 
Class 56.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn incorporated the state railway, goods train, tender locomotives with one leading axle and four coupled axles into Class 56.
Class 56.30.
The Prussian G 8.2 is a variant of the Prussian G 8.3 with two cylinders. The Reichsbahn gave running numbers 56 3001 - 56 3008 to those of the Lübeck-Büchen Railway, which were also used on passenger train duties. 
Class 57.
The DRG Class 57 encompassed various ex-state railway, goods train, tender locomotives with E axle arrangements.
Class 57.10-35.
The Reichsbahn allocated running numbers 57 1001 - 57 3524 to the Prussian T 16 and also the G 10 which had evolved from the Prussian P 8.
Class 58.
The DRG's Class 58 includes various ex-state railway, goods train, tender locomotives with an axle arrangement of 1'E (Decapod). Because they were used by almost all the Länderbahn railway administrations (except Bavaria), they are often described as the first German "Einheitslokomotiven", despite oft-repeated comments to the contrary.
Class 58.2-3.
The Baden G 12 of the Royal Württemberg State Railways was based on the Prussian G 12.1 and a goods train locomotive class with a 1'E axle arrangement built by Henschel for the Royal Ottoman General Division of Military Railways ("Kaiserlich Ottomanische Generaldirektion of the Militäreisenbahnen" or "C.F.O.A.").
Class 58.10-21.
The Prussian G 12 was built for the Prussian state railways and was based on the Prussian G 12.1 and a goods train, locomotive with a 1'E axle arrangement built by Henschel for the Royal Ottoman General Division of Military Railways ("Kaiserlich Ottomanische Generaldirektion of the Militäreisenbahnen" or "C.F.O.A.").
Class 58.30.

The Class 65s were passenger train, tank locomotives with the Deutsche Bundesbahn and East German Deutsche Reichsbahn.
Class 65.10.
Like the DB Class 65, the DR Class 65.10 were intended for commuter traffic on suburban railway lines. The Deutsche Reichsbahn bought a total of 88 engines of this class. 
Class 66.
The DB Class 66 was planned by the Deutsche Bundesbahn for fast freight and passenger train services on main and branch lines. These "Neubaulokomotiven" were intended to replace "Länderbahn" passenger train tank locomotives like the Class 38.10, 78 and 93 and were the penultimate locomotive series built as part of the DB's "Neubau" programme of newly designed engines.
Class 70.
The DRG's Class 70 incorporated all passenger train, tank locomotives with a 1B axle arrangement:
Class 70.0.

Class 95.0.
The Class 95.0 was a ten-coupled tank locomotive with an axle arrangement of 1'E1'. It was procured by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922 for heavy goods train duties on steep main line routes. Because the development of this class was begun by the Prussian state railways, it was designated as the "T 20".
Class 95.66.
The Class 95.66 was a ten-coupled tank locomotive with an axle arrangement of 1'E1', which the Halberstadt-Blankenburger Eisenbahn procured in 1920 for duties on steep routes as a replacemetn for rack railway locomotives. The series, comprising 4 locomotives, was the technical precursor of the Prussian T 20, later DRG Class 95.0.
Class 97.
Rack railway steam locomotives were incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn into Class 97.

Herbert Brook Workman

Herbert Brook Workman (1862–1951) was a leading Methodist and secretary of the Wesleyan Methodist Secondary Schools Trust when they took over Elmfield College in 1928.
Workman was born in London and educated at Kingswood School and Owens College, Manchester. He entered the Wesleyan ministry in 1885 and served as a Circuit minister in England and Scotland until 1903 when he was appointed Principal of Westminster College. In 1930 he was elected President of the Wesleyan Conference.
A distinguished historian, Workman was Cole Lecturer at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee in 1916 and temporary professor of Methodist Church history at the University of Chicago in 1927. He published extensively in the field of Medieval Church history as well as Methodism.
Workman's nickname was "Prinny" and as he was a key figure in the closure of Elmfield College, he came in for some satire when the closure was announced: several angry teachers at Elmfield drew a satirical coat-of-arms on the blackboard in the shape of an upturned dustbin with Dr Workman's legs protruding over the motto ""Prinny suncus tiperi ashes"" (Booth: 40).

Ausbesserungswerk

An Ausbesserungswerk (abbreviation AW or Aw) is a railway facility in German-speaking countries, the primary function of which is the repair (and formerly also the construction) of railway vehicles or their components. It is thus equivalent to a 'repair shop' or 'works'. It is also referred to as Centralwerkstatt (central workshop) or Hauptwerkstatt (main workshop). During the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) period between the two world wars these facilities were called Reichsbahnausbesserungswerke (RAW) (Reichsbahn repair shops). 
Terminology.
Whilst the term "Ausbesserungswerk" was used by the former Deutsche Bundesbahn in West Germany after the war, the railway workshops in the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany continued to refer to them as "Reichsbahnausbesserungswerke" until 1992. The term "Hauptwerkstatt" was also commonly used by state railways ("Länderbahn") or private railways and they are still called that today, for example, in Austria. In general the Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) today uses the term Werk (works); these facilities belonging to the "DB Instandhaltung Gmbh" (DB Maintenance Co Ltd). 
Functions.
In contrast to the Bahnbetriebswerke, that are responsible for routine, everyday tasks, "Ausbesserungswerke" specialise in major repairs, general inspections and the refurbishment of exchangeable components. In addition they handle the conversion and modernisation of vehicles, as well as the construction of new vehicles in some cases. On top of the maintenance of vehicles, most "Ausbesserungswerke" also carry out the manufacture of turnouts, the construction of signal gantries, platform roofing and similar steel structures. Depending on the particular specialisation of an individual "Ausbesserungswerk" it may also be described as a "Reisezugwagenwerk" (coach works), "Güterwagenwerk" (goods wagon works) or "Weichenwerk" (turnout works).
History.
With the expansion of the railway network from the middle of the 19th century a large number of "Ausbesserungswerke" sprang up in the entire German speaking world. During the transition from maintenance-intensive steam traction to the more maintenance-friendly electric and diesel locomotives, as well as the increasing rationalisation of workshop operations, the number of "Ausbesserungswerke" needed could be reduced significantly. Today the Deutsche Bahn only retains the "Ausbesserungswerke" at Neumünster (coaches), Cottbus (diesel locomotives), Chemnitz (components), Paderborn-Nord (goods wagons), Witten (turnout works), Bremen (diesel locomotives), Kassel (diesel railcars), Krefeld-Oppum (electric railcars), Dessau (electric locomotives), Fulda (components), Nuremberg (electric railcars), Meiningen (historic vehicles, goods wagons and snow clearing equipment), Eberswalde (goods wagons), Zwickau (goods wagons) and Wittenberge (coaches). In addition, there are "Hauptwerkstätten" for the Berlin S-Bahn at Berlin-Schöneweide and the Hamburg S-Bahn at Hamburg-Ohlsdorf.
The Deutsche Bahn AG aside, the Austrian Federal Railways, Swiss Federal Railways and large private railways have their own "Hauptwerkstätten". In Weiden, Stendal and Delitzsch "Ausbesserungswerke" belonging to the DB AG and its predecessors have been transferred to private ownership.
A private "Ausbesserungswerk" in Unterhausen (Bavaria) at Neuburg an der Donau maintains goods vehicles, mainly tank wagons.
Typical layout.
The constructional heart of an "Ausbesserungswerk" is usually a large, multi-track, main workshop building (the "Richthalle"), which enables several railway vehicles to be worked on simultaneously at a number of work stations. These stations are equipped with lifting gear in order to be able to jack vehicles up and separate the wagon bodies from their undercarriages. Adjoining the main workshop are mechanical and electrical workshops for the refurbishment and repair of individual components such as undercarriages, brake equipment and motors. The external livery of railway vehicles is carried out in a paint shed, separate from the main workshop.
U-Bahn and tram repair shops.
"Hauptwerkstätten" for railway vehicles are not just found on normal railways, but also on the U-Bahn (underground) and tramways. Due to the comparatively small number of vehicles to be maintained the "Hauptwerkstätten" are in most cases attached to tramway sheds ("Bahnbetriebshöfen"). An example of a tram workshop is the "Hauptwerkstätte" of the Vienna tramway system.
Former "Ausbesserungswerke" in Germany.
In addition to "Ausbesserungswerke" still in use, the Deutsche Bahn AG and its predecessors had "Ausbesserungswerke" and "Hauptwerkstätten" at the following locations:

Harvey Whitehill

Harvey Whitehill (September 2, 1838 - September 14, 1906) was a sheriff of the American Old West, whose life as a lawman was documented in the book "Sheriff Harvey Whitehill; Silver City Stalwart", by author Robert Alexander. Alexander also wrote extensively about Whitehill in "Six-Guns and Single-Jacks: A History of Silver City and Southwestern New Mexico".
Life on the frontier.
Harvey Whitehill, a native of Ohio, ventured into New Mexico Territory about the time of the Apache Wars in the mid-1860s, and he took part in those. In 1874, Whitehill ran for and was elected sheriff of Grant County, New Mexico. The county seat, Silver City, was, at the time, an extremely wild town. Whitehill immediately set to policing it, and quickly gained the respect of its citizens. In early 1875, he befriended and hired gunman "Dangerous Dan" Tucker, a move with which many disagreed, due to Tucker having ridden with outlaw John Kinney, but which ultimately would prove to have been the right choice for that time. With Tucker, Whitehill set about to tame the small frontier town. During this period, both Tucker and he were involved in numerous shootouts with outlaws and trouble-making miners, in addition to conducting several legal hangings following court convictions. Tucker would later be a subject in the book "Deadly Dozen", by Robert K. DeArment, describing Tucker as one of the twelve most underrated gunmen of the Old West.
In April and September 1875, Whitehill arrested Billy the Kid, then known as William Bonney, becoming the first lawman to do so. The first offense was for stealing cheese, and the second for stealing laundry. Whitehill would later state Bonney was an extremely likeable young man, and that his acts of theft were more due to necessity than him being a criminal, since his mother had recently died at the time. Also, Whitehill put to rest the legend that Bonney left Silver City due to having killed a man there, with Whitehill stating the killing was a rumor and never happened. He would personally know outlaw John Kinney, and evidently was well respected by both the citizens and the outlaw element. In 1882, a year after being credited with killing Billy the Kid, lawman Pat Garrett ran against Whitehill for the office of sheriff. It was ironic, in that Whitehill was the first lawman to arrest Bonney, whereas Garrett was the last. Garrett, who was not well liked in the area, was defeated by Whitehill in the election.
The Gage train robbery and after.
On November 24, 1883, a train robbery took place at a way station called Gage, near Silver City, with $830.60 being stolen. During the robbery, the train engineer, T.C. Webster, and the messenger, T.G. Hodgekins, were both shot and killed. Whitehill immediately set out for the robbers, leading a small posse. Whitehill first tracked down robber George Washington Cleavland, capturing him in Socorro, New Mexico. Whitehill convinced Cleavland his fellow robbers had all been captured, and that they had implicated him as the shooter of the engineer. Believing this, Cleavland denied he had killed the engineer, and made a full confession, detailing the robbery and his fellow robbers.
A short time later, Whitehill tracked down the other robbers, Mitch Lee, G.S. Collins, Frank Taggert, and Kit Joy. Less than two weeks later, while under guard by Deputy Dick Ware in the Silver City jail, Taggert and Lee overpowered Ware, while Joy took his guns. They then freed any other prisoners present, including Cleavland, took all guns from the jail, and fled. Whitehill organized a posse, and went in pursuit. Receiving information from a citizen of the escapees' direction of travel, Whitehill set up to capture them at a pass near the Pinos Altos Mountains. The posse opened fire, killing Cleavland immediately. A Mexican prisoner, Carlos Chavez, who had escaped with them was killed next, while the others dismounted and scampered for cover. Lee was mortally wounded a few minutes later, and Taggert, with no ammunition left, surrendered. Joy was able to make a break, shooting and killing posse member Joe Le Fur, while being wounded himself, hence escaping. Then, all of the escaped prisoners surrendered. Usually, those who had survived a shootout were to be taken back to the jail, but instead Whitehill and his posse hanged them on the spot. Only one prisoner, Charles Spencer, who though armed, proved by showing them his pistol and confirming he had not fired, was spared. Joy was later shot and wounded, a wound which caused the amputation of his left leg, by rancher Erichos "Rackety" Smith, near the Gila River. Tried and convicted in Hillsboro, New Mexico for the murder of Webster, he was sentenced to life in prison. He was never tried for the murder of Le Fur. Many years later, he was released, retiring to Bisbee, Arizona.
Whitehill would serve a total of six terms as sheriff of Grant County, marrying his wife Harriet and fathering twelve children. His terms were not consecutive, as he left the office to serve one term in the Territorial Legislature in 1882. Although lesser known than many other lawmen of the Old West, Whitehill is credited by many historians as having been more effective in that role than many who would ultimately become better known, to include his former political rival, Pat Garrett. He died in Deming, New Mexico on September 14, 1906, and is buried in the Masonic cemetery, in Silver City.

The Longest Memory

The Longest Memory is a short fiction novel (only 137 pages long) by British writer Fred D'Aguiar. The story takes place on a Virginian plantation, in the period before the American Civil War (Between 1790 and 1810). The book is told through many different people and in different forms. It begins in first person, with Whitechapel, the oldest and most respected slave on the plantation, recounting the sorrows of his life. From there on in each chapter is narrated by a different character, sometimes speaking through verse, via diary entry or in second person. Most of the chapters are narrated by characters central to the story, however chapter 11 is purely made up of fictitious editorials from the local newspaper known as the Virginian.
Plot.
A young slave, Chapel, falls in love with the daughter of the plantation owner. He attempts to run away and join his lover in the north. However his father, Whitechapel, betrays his whereabouts, fearing that his son will die if he is not captured and returned home to the plantation. Chapel is captured and brought back to the plantation where he is whipped by Sanders Junior, the overseer. Chapel catches a fever after the whipping and dies, due to his weak state. Everybody blames Whitechapel for Chapel's death.
Mr. Whitechapel, the owner of the plantation was away from the plantation that day, and was unaware of the occurrences taking place. He had given specific instructions to hold the slave until he returned, which were not carried out by Sanders Jr. Mr Whitechapel is angered when he finds out that Sanders Jr. whipped his half brother to death. Then the book goes back in time to the diary of Sanders Senior, the memories of Cook and Lydia. It is then finished with extacts from the Virginian local newspaper of the year 1810 having direct connections with the events of the story.
Awards.
"The Longest Memory" was the winner of the Whitbread First Novel Award and the David Higham Prize for Fiction.

<doc id="19604151" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19604151" title="Atomic mass">
Atomic mass

The atomic mass ("m"a) is the mass of an atomic particle, sub-atomic particle, or molecule. It may be expressed in unified atomic mass units; by international agreement, 1 atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom (at rest). When expressed in such units, the atomic mass is called the relative isotopic mass (see section below).
The atomic mass or relative isotopic mass refers to the mass of a single particle, and is fundamentally different from the quantities elemental atomic weight (also called "relative "atomic" mass") and standard atomic weight, both of which refer to averages (mathematical means) of naturally-occurring atomic mass values for samples of elements. Such averages are expected to have a variance according to the sample source for the collection of nuclides that make up a sample of a chemical element (each of which has its own exact characteristic atomic mass). Such mixtures reflect various abundance ratios of isotopes of the element as the ratios naturally occur in the place where the element sample was collected. "By contrast," atomic mass figures refer to identical particle species; due to the exactly identical nature of species of atomic particles, atomic mass values are expected to have no intrinsic variance at all. Atomic mass figures are thus commonly reported to many more significant figures than atomic weights.
The atomic mass of atoms, ions, or atomic nuclei is slightly less than the sum total mass of their constituting protons, neutrons, or electrons, due to binding energy mass loss (as per "E"="mc"2).
Relative isotopic mass: the same quantity as atomic mass, but with different units.
Relative "isotopic" mass is not to be confused with the averaged quantity "relative "atomic" mass," which is the same as atomic weight (see above). Relative isotopic mass is similar to atomic mass and has exactly the same numerical value as atomic mass, whenever atomic mass is expressed in unified atomic mass units. However, relative isotopic mass is a pure number with no units. This loss of units results from the use of a scaling ratio with respect to a carbon-12 standard, and the word "relative" in the term "relative isotopic mass" refers to this scaling relative to carbon-12. 
The relative isotopic mass, then, is the mass of a given isotope (specifically, any single nuclide), when this value is scaled by the mass of carbon-12, when the latter is set equal to 12. Equivalently, the relative isotopic mass of an isotope or nuclide is the mass of the isotope relative to 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.
For example, the relative isotopic mass of carbon-12 is exactly 12, but (as in the case of atomic mass) no nuclides other than carbon-12 have exactly whole-number values in this scale. As is the case for the related "atomic mass" when expressed in unified atomic mass units, the relative isotopic mass numbers of nuclides other than carbon-12 are not whole numbers, but are always close to whole numbers. This is discussed more fully below.
Similar terms for different quantities.
The atomic mass and relative isotopic mass are sometimes confused, or incorrectly used, as synonyms of relative atomic mass (also known as atomic weight) and the standard atomic weight (a particular variety of atomic weight). However, as noted in the introduction, atomic weight and standard atomic weight represent terms for averages of isotopic abundances, not for single nuclides. As such, atomic weight and standard atomic weight often differ numerically from relative isotopic mass, and they can also have different units than atomic mass when this quantity is not expressed in unified atomic mass units (see the linked article for atomic weight). 
The atomic mass (relative isotopic mass) is defined as the mass of a single atom, which can only be one isotope (nuclide) at a time, and is not an abundance-weighted average, as in the case of relative atomic mass/atomic weight. The atomic mass or relative isotopic mass of each isotope and nuclide of a chemical element is therefore a number that can in principle be measured to a very great precision, since every specimen of such a nuclide is expected to be exactly identical to every other specimen, as all atoms of a given type in the same energy state, and every specimen of a particular nuclide, are expected to be exactly identical in mass to every other specimen of that nuclide. For example, every atom of oxygen-16 is expected to have exactly the same atomic mass (relative atomic mass) as every other atom of oxygen-16. 
In the case of many elements that have one naturally occurring isotope (mononuclidic elements) or one dominant isotope, the actual numerical similarity/difference between the atomic mass of the most common isotope, and the relative atomic mass or (standard) atomic weight can be small or even nil, and does affect most bulk calculations. However, such an error can exist and even be important when considering individual atoms for elements that are not mononuclidic. 
For non-mononuclidic elements that have more than one common isotope, the numerical difference in relative atomic mass (atomic weight) from even the most common relative isotopic mass, can be half a mass unit or more (e.g. see the case of chlorine where atomic weight and standard atomic weight are about 35.45). The atomic mass (relative isotopic mass) of an uncommon isotope can differ from the relative atomic mass, atomic weight, or standard atomic weight, by several mass units.
Atomic masses expressed in unified atomic mass units (i.e. relative isotopic masses) are always close to whole-number values, but never (except in the case of carbon-12) exactly a whole number. The difference from whole numbers for these values is due to two factors: the different mass of neutrons and protons acting to change the total mass in nuclides that have a other than the 1:1 ratio of carbon-12; and [2 an exact whole-number would not be expected if there exists a loss/gain of mass signifying a difference in mean binding energy relative to the mean binding energy for carbon-12. Experimentally, this is always the case.
The ratio of atomic mass to mass number varies from about 0.99884 for 56Fe to 1.00782505 for 1H.
Any mass defect due to nuclear binding energy is experimentally a small fraction (less than 1%) compared to the mass of a nucleon, and is an even smaller percentage compared to the average mass per nucleon in carbon-12, which is moderately strongly-bound compared with other atoms. Since protons and neutrons differ from each other in mass by an even smaller fraction (about 0.0014 u), the practice of rounding the atomic mass of any given nuclide or isotope to the nearest whole number, always gives the simple whole number total nucleon count, or mass number. The neutron count (neutron number) may then be derived by subtracting the number of protons (atomic number).
Mass defects in atomic masses.
The amount that the ratio of atomic masses to mass number deviates from 1 is as follows: the deviation starts positive at hydrogen-1, becomes negative until a minimum is reached at iron-56, iron-58 and nickel-62, then increases to positive values in the heavy isotopes, with increasing atomic number. This corresponds to the fact that nuclear fission in an element heavier than zirconium produces energy, and fission in any element lighter than niobium requires energy. On the other hand, nuclear fusion reactions: fusion of two atoms of an element lighter than scandium produces energy, whereas fusion in elements heavier than calcium requires energy.
The difference mass number minus atomic mass is not maximized at iron-56 (where it is around 0.06 atomic mass units), but at heavier elements where it reaches about 0.10 atomic mass units.
Here are some values of the ratio of atomic mass to mass number:
Measurement of atomic masses.
Direct comparison and measurement of the masses of atoms is achieved with mass spectrometry.
Conversion factor between atomic mass units and grams.
The standard scientific unit for dealing with atoms in macroscopic quantities is the mole (symbol: mol), which is defined arbitrarily as the amount of a substance with as many atoms or other units as there are in 12 grams of the carbon isotope C-12. The number of atoms in a mole is called Avogadro's number, the value of which is approximately 6.022 × 10 mol−1. 
One mole of a substance always contains almost exactly the "relative atomic mass" or "molar mass" of that substance (which is the concept of molar mass), expressed in grams; however, this may or may not be true for the "atomic mass," depending on whether or not the element exists naturally in more than one isotope. For example, the relative atomic mass of iron is 55.847 g/mol, and therefore one mole of iron as commonly found on earth has a mass of 55.847 grams. The "atomic mass" of the 56Fe isotope is 55.935 u and one mole of 56Fe atoms would then in theory weigh 55.935 g, but such amounts of pure 56Fe have never been found on Earth. However, there exist in nature 22 mononuclidic elements for which essentially only a single isotope is found in nature (common examples are fluorine, sodium, aluminum and phosphorus), and for these elements the relative atomic mass and atomic mass are the same. Samples of these elements therefore may serve as reference standards for certain atomic mass values.
The formulaic conversion between atomic mass units and SI mass in grams for a single atom is:
where formula_2 is the Molar mass constant and formula_3 is the Avogadro constant.
Relationship between atomic and molecular masses.
Similar definitions apply to molecules. One can compute the molecular mass of a compound by adding the atomic masses of its constituent atoms (nuclides). One can compute the molar mass of a compound by adding the relative atomic masses of the elements given in the chemical formula. In both cases the multiplicity of the atoms (the number of times it occurs) must be taken into account, usually by multiplication of each unique mass by its multiplicity.
History.
The first scientists to determine relative atomic masses were John Dalton and Thomas Thomson between 1803 and 1805 and Jöns Jakob Berzelius between 1808 and 1826. 'Relative atomic mass ("Atomic weight") was originally defined relative to that of the lightest element hydrogen taken as 1.00, and in the 1820s Prout's hypothesis stated that atomic masses of all elements would prove via a whole number rule to be exact multiples of this hydrogen relative atomic mass. Berzelius, however, soon proved that this hypothesis did not always hold even approximately, and in some elements, such as chlorine, relative atomic mass falls almost exactly between two multiples of the hydrogen relative atomic mass. Still later, as noted, this was shown to be an isotope effect, and that the atomic masses of pure isotopes, or nuclides, are multiples of the hydrogen mass, to within about 1%.
In the 1860s Stanislao Cannizzaro refined relative atomic masses by applying Avogadro's law (notably at the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860). He formulated a law to determine relative atomic masses of elements: "the different quantities of the same element contained in different molecules are all whole multiples of the atomic weight" and determined relative atomic masses and molecular masses by comparing the vapor density of a collection of gases with molecules containing one or more of the chemical element in question.
In the early twentieth century, up until the 1960s chemists and physicists used two different atomic-mass scales. The chemists used a scale such that the natural mixture of oxygen isotopes had an atomic mass 16, while the physicists assigned the same number 16 to the atomic mass of the most common oxygen isotope (containing eight protons and eight neutrons). However, because oxygen-17 and oxygen-18 are also present in natural oxygen this led to 2 different tables of atomic mass. The unified scale based on carbon-12, 12C, met the physicists' need to base the scale on a pure isotope, while being numerically close to the chemists' scale.
The term "atomic weight" is being phased out slowly and being replaced by "relative atomic mass", in most current usage. The history of this shift in nomenclature reaches back to the 1960s and has been the source of much debate in the scientific community. The debate was largely created by the adoption of the unified atomic mass unit and the realization that weight was in some ways an inappropriate term. The argument for keeping the term "atomic weight" was primarily that it was a well understood term to those in the field, that the term "atomic mass" was already in use (as it is currently defined) and that the term "relative atomic mass" was in some ways redundant. In 1979, in a compromise move, the definition was refined and the term "relative atomic mass" was introduced as a secondary synonym. Twenty years later the primacy of these synonyms was reversed and the term "relative atomic mass" is now the preferred term; however the "standard atomic weights" have maintained the same name.

Bahnbetriebswerk

A Bahnbetriebswerk is the equivalent of a locomotive depot (or motive power depot) on the German and Austrian railways. It is an installation that carries out the maintenance, minor repairs, refuelling and cleaning of locomotives and other motive power. In addition it organises the deployment of locomotives and crews. In the Deutsche Bahn, a "Bahnbetriebswerk" is known today as a "Betriebshof"; the ÖBB refer to it as a "Zugförderungsstelle" ("Zf"). Many other countries simply use the term 'depot'. The smaller facility, the "Lokomotivstation" (also "Einsatzstelle" or "Lokbahnhof") akin to the British sub-depot or stabling point, is affiliated to a "Bahnbetriebswerk".
N.B. The shortened form Betriebswerk is also used and both are commonly abbreviated to Bw or BW. The plural is Bahnbetriebswerke.
History.
Beginnings.
On 7 January 1835 the first "Bahnbetriebswerk" in Germany was opened. It looked after locomotives on the first railway line in Germany, the "Bavarian Ludwigsbahn" from Nuremberg to Fürth. It was here that the first locomotive in Germany, the "Adler", was assembled and maintained. The inventor or father of the "Bahnbetriebswerk" was John Blenkinsop. He was the first to recognise that smooth railway operations needed well-equipped workshops and suitable personnel and, as a result, was entrusted with the technical direction of the Brunswick State Railway. Soon afterwards the first "Bahnbetriebswerk" was built. Not only did it carry out the usual functions of such a depot, but also others such as the construction of locomotives. In 1845, John Blenkinsop was clear that it was considerably cheaper to service locomotives at regular intervals than not to repair them until they broke down. He therefore laid the foundations for what subsequently became the routine tasks of a "Bahnbetriebswerk", although it was several years before they were divided into "Bahnbetriebswerke" and "Ausbesserungswerke" or repair shops. Gradually all the other German railway companies organised their technical support based on the example of the Ludwigsbahn and Brunswick State Railway.
Because the radius of action of the first steam locomotives was only about 80 km, facilities were installed at all larger stations for the maintenance of locomotives; in particular coal and water supplies had to be replenished. Such facilities also appeared at junctions, which explains why there were so many locomotive sheds of that type.
Länderbahn period.
From the 1860s, all railway companies separated the functions of traffic operating (working the locomotives) and mechanical engineering. Over time, the first repair shops ("Ausbesserungswerke") also appeared, known at that time as "Hauptwerkstätten" (main workshops). On the creation of the German Empire the system described above was adopted by everyone and, in addition, many private railways were nationalised with the result that this approach was eventually followed by those too.
Deutsche Reichsbahn 1920-1945.
With the takeover of the German state railways (the "Länderbahnen") following the state treaty of 30 April 1920 the organisation of engineering services was standardised across the whole of Germany. The Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) set up various Reichsbahn divisions ("Reichsbahndirektionen") and engineering offices ("Maschinenämter"). On 1 August 1935 there were 7 Reichsbahn divisions and 132 engineering offices.
The new organisational regulations introduced in the 1920s proved their worth, nevertheless the number of "Bahnbetriebswerke" rose and fell significantly. Initially the DR turned large "Lokbahnhöfe" into "Bahnbetriebswerke", but on the foundation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft things changed suddenly. A fifth of the reparations that had to be handed to the victorious powers after World War I had to be absorbed by the DRG. In order to be able to manage that, rationalisation measures had to be taken; above all almost all areas had to make savings. In addition the management was streamlined which led to the closure of all smaller "Bahnbetriebswerke". At the same time so-called "Großbahnbetriebswerke" (large locomotive depots) were created. Medium and small facilities were often integrated into these "Betriebswerke". As a result giant depots emerged that had a multitude of maintenance facilities. Examples include: Dresden-Friedrichstadt, Hamburg-Altona, Hamm and Osnabrück. They were often responsible for the maintenance of over 150 locomotives.
Deutsche Bundesbahn 1945-1993.
The Deutsche Bundesbahn began from 1950 to turn smaller "Bahnbetriebswerke" into outstations. This development was accelerated by the changeover in traction, because considerably fewer personnel were needed for diesel and electric locomotives. And the reduction in passenger and goods traffic rendered some of the "Bahnbetriebswerk" capacity superfluous. From 1956 to 1969 the Deutsche Bundesbahn closed a total of 77 "Bahnbetriebswerke". The end of the steam era in the DB led to further closures.
Deutsche Reichsbahn 1945-1993.
Initially the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany went in the other direction. Many smaller stabling points ("Lokbahnhöfe") were promoted to "Bahnbetriebswerke", primarily in order to ensure better maintenance of the locomotives on the spot. Not until the start of the changeover in traction in the mid-1960s did the DR begin to follow a similar pattern to the DB. Smaller "Bahnbetriebswerke" were now closed, but most remained in service as locomotive stables. For diesel and electric locomotive servicing the DR generally made do with existing facilities; the construction of new, modern installations was only carried out in a few cases.
Deutsche Bahn AG since 1994.
With the reform of the railways and the formation of Deutsche Bahn the century old operating concepts were completely changed - the unity of operations and maintenance was given up. These two functions were taken over by the business areas of traction and works. The "Betriebswerke" were renamed "Betriebshöfe", each under its own manager. With this new structure the works now just became suppliers of maintenance jobs that were allocated to them from the traction business area. This totally new arrangement started a wave of rationalisations in Deutsche Bahn that led to the closure of works and "Betriebshöfen". In the former Deutsche Reichsbahn's area (i.e. eastern Germany) even the large "Bahnbetriebswerke" were shut. In order to deploy new motive units, such as the ICE, "Betriebshöfe" had to be enlarged in order to be able to service the new vehicles.
Tasks.
"Bahnbetriebswerke" are responsible for carrying out routine maintenance and minor repairs on locomotives in service. The allocation of crews to train services is also planned and executed in a "Bahnbetriebswerk". At specified intervals (usually once or twice a week), all the components of a locomotive are inspected and tested by the 'inspecting mechanics' ("Nachschauschlosser"). Larger "Bahnbetriebswerke" with more comprehensive equipment also carry out big repairs themselves, such as the replacement of engines or the profile milling of wheelsets using below ground wheelset turning equipment.
Steam era.
The largest amount of work was that which once had to be carried out in order to maintain steam locomotives. In addition to the replenishment of operating supplies - water, coal and braking sand - the cinders had to be emptied from the grate and smokebox daily. Even the oiling of all the bearings was part of the daily schedule of work for a steam locomotive. It was also important to turn tender locomotives in the planned direction of travel. One of the most important maintenance jobs in the "Bw" that was part of the laid-down routine was the washing out of the boiler.
Diesel and electric locomotives.
With the changeover of traction from steam to diesel and electric locomotives, a comprehensive reorganisation of "Bahnbetriebswerke" was necessary. Sites that were only needed for the maintenance of steam locomotives no longer had any significance. And whilst for the servicing of electric locomotives, hardly any special installations were necessary apart from the erection of catenary in the "Bw", the most important measure for the stabling of diesel locomotives was the installation of refuelling equipment.
By comparison the amount of work needed to service electric locomotives is quite small, and is mainly restricted to replenishing the brake sand containers, greasing the relatively few grease points and functional testing – especially of the train safety (PZB) equipment.
The same tasks have to be carried out on diesel locomotives as well. In addition, at regular intervals, the motors and drives have to serviced, including the changing of oil and various filters. Present-day "Bws" have to therefore have the right equipment for oil changes.
Present-day.
Modern diesel and electric locomotives need very little maintenance thanks to a large number of maintenance-light and non-wearing components. For that reason there are only a few "Bahnbetriebswerke" today compared with those in the steam era and they often concentrated on the maintenance and repair of an entire locomotive class. 
In the Deutsche Bahn today's "Bahnbetriebswerke", called "Betriebshöfe", are increasingly independent and divided up between several DB AG business areas. In the ÖBB the "Technische Services" division is responsible for them. In the majority of "Betriebshöfe", jobs are also carried out for other companies, for example, the maintenance of private railway stock. This is because the private railway operators cannot afford to build their own depots and so the task of maintaining locomotives is often handed over to the "Betriebshöfe" of the national railways. 
The "Betriebshöfe" are restricted areas that are usually not open to the public. The work is not just carried out during the day, but predominantly at night, when large numbers of locomotives are not needed for traction duties. ICEs or other multiple units are also stored in the "Betriebshöfe", which is not accessible and therefore there is no graffiti problem, as is often the case when unprotected goods wagons are stored in the open.
At "Betriebshöfe" which still have buildings from the steam era, there are often problems in extending them. Buildings that are under heritage protection may not be torn down. Otherwise "Betriebshöfe" are basically laid out so that they can be extended in any direction. Even in the planning stages, consideration must be given to ensuring there is enough additional real estate that can be bought without difficulty if it is later decided to extend the facility.
Former "Betriebswerke" are often no longer used and completely overgrown. Often the trackage is totally removed and only the buildings under historical protection remain. There is however a project in Germany to turn a former "Bahnbetriebswerk" into the largest railway experience world in the country. This involves restoring all the ramshackle buildings to their original state once again.
Special purpose trains.
As well as the maintenance of locomotives, several "Bahnbetriebswerke" are also responsible for looking after special trains - even the changeover of traction has not changed that. The most important units are emergency trains (to re-rail rolling stock that has derailed) and snow clearance equipment. Up to the 1980s there were also fire trains, whose function has since been subsumed by the railway fire services. For the smooth operation of a "Bahnbetriebswerk" shunters are also needed to move wagons, coaches and locomotives that cannot move under their own power. Up to 20 years ago there were other special trains, such as the used oil trains, that have since all been retired.
Road vehicle maintenance.
The first Deutsche Reichsbahn buses and lorries entered service in 1933. The maintenance and repair of these vehicles was entrusted to newly created vehicle depots, the "Kraftwagenbetriebswerke" ("KBW, KBw"), which were often attached to existing "Bahnbetriebswerke".
Deutsche Bundesbahn.
Until the privatisation and reorganisation of the bus services in the Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1990, they also had "Kraftwagenbetriebswerke" ("KBW"). Amongst other things they handled the engineering aspects of bus services, i.e. the allocation of crews and vehicles, servicing and repairs. In addition other DB road vehicles were maintained, for example the lorries of the DB's own long distance haulage fleet and the heavy transporters with "Culemeyer" trailers and tractors. The DB heavy transport group ("Straße-Schiene" i.e. 'road-rail') was however based in Hagen. The general inspections were carried out by DB staff. "Kraftwagenbetriebswerke" were even attached to some of the DB's own driving schools. Smaller facilities, the "K-Gruppe" were attached to "Bahnbetriebswerke" (e.g. in Hamelin). Locations with "Kraftwagenbetriebswerke" included Hanover, Hamburg, Bremen, Brunswick and Kassel.
Deutsche Reichsbahn.
There were even "Kraftwagenbetriebswerke" ("Kbw") in the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR that were responsible for the servicing and repair of all railway works vehicles. These included a few buses and lorries to supplement rail services, but were mainly internal fault-clearing, delivery, supply or specialised works vehicles.
Deutsche Bahn.
In 1993 the maintenance and distribution of vehicles was changed. The remaining fleet was transferred to the new business area known as the "DB-Fuhrparkservice".

William C. Chase

Major General William Curtis Chase (9 March 1895–21 August 1986) was an American soldier and General in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his service in the South West Pacific Area during World War II and in the Occupation of Japan.
A graduate of Brown University, Chase enlisted in the Rhode Island National Guard in 1913 and served on the Mexican Border. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the cavalry in January 1917, he served on the Western Front in World War I and in the Occupation of the Rhineland. Between the wars, he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, later returning as an instructor. 
Chase was promoted to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. He was chosen to lead the assault on the Admiralty Islands in February 1944. He resisted the temptation to swiftly overrun the island, and thereby overextend his forces, and formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, he was able to defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison. 
In February 1945, Chase's columns pushed into the northern outskirts of Manila, liberating some 3,700 internees at the University of Santo Tomas which had been turned into an internment camp. He took over command of the 38th Infantry Division, which was confronted by enemy fortifications at Zig-Zag Pass on the Bataan Peninsula that took a week of hard fighting to reduce. Chase assumed command of the 1st Cavalry Division on 1 August 1945. He remained with it in the Occupation of Japan until he returned to the United States in January 1949. Later, he was chief of staff of the Third Army at Fort McPherson and head of the Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan. Retiring from the Army, he earned a Master of Arts degree in history from Trinity University and taught political science at the University of Houston.
Education and early life.
William Curtis Chase was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on 9 March 1896, the son of William Beecher Chase and his wife, Doris Evelyn née Curtis. He attended Brown University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts with a Phi Beta Kappa Society key in 1916. While at Brown, Chase enlisted in Battery A, 1st Rhode Island Volunteer Artillery of the Rhode Island National Guard (later Battery A, 103rd Field Artillery) in 1913.
World War I.
On the afternoon of his graduation from Brown in 1916, Chase, now a sergeant, joined A Battery at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where it was mobilised for duty on the Mexican Border. The unit remained in the El Paso, Texas, area for a time, but saw no action. While there, Chase passed an examination for commissions in Regular Army. Chase was posted to Fort Leavenworth in January 1917 for a three month course for newly commissioned officers before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the cavalry.
Chase was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry, then based at Fort Sam Houston. Shortly after the United States declared war on Germany, he was promoted to first lieutenant and posted to the 6th Cavalry on the Mexican frontier. 
Chase attended a machine gun course at Fort Sill, after which he was posted to the 11th Machine Gun Battalion, part of the 4th Division, in April 1918. He served on the Western Front with the 4th Division, participating in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, but came down with jaundice and missed all but the last days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He participated in the Occupation of the Rhineland before the 4th Division returned to the United States in July 1919.
Inter-war years.
On return, Chase was posted to the 16th Cavalry, then in the Rio Grande Valley, although it soon returned to Fort Sam Houston. In 1921 he was posted to Michigan State College for duty with the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. There he met Dorothea Marie Wetherbee. They were married in 1921. They never had children. 
Chase attended the United States Army Cavalry School and United States Army Infantry School, followed by duty with the 14th Cavalry at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, from 1927 to 1929. He then attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. From 1931 to 1934 he served overseas with the 26th Cavalry (Philippine Scouts) at Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines. Returning to the United States, he was posted as an Instructor in Tactics, first at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley and then, from 1938 to 1940, at the Command and General Staff College.
World War II.
In 1941 Chase, now a lieutenant colonel, was posted to VIII Corps, then commanded by Major General Walter Krueger. As such, he participated in the Louisiana Maneuvers. In December 1941, he was posted to the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, then under the command of Major General Holland Smith. Based at Marine Corps Base Quantico, the Amphibious Force practiced Amphibious warfare tactics on Chesapeake Bay.
In 1942, Chase assumed command of the 113th Cavalry, an Iowa National Guard unit. Initially a horse-mechanized unit, the 113th Cavalry soon became fully mechanized. It moved from its original station at Fort Clark, Texas, to Camp Bowie and then to Fort Hood, where it provided school troops for the Tank Destroyer Center.
Chase was promoted to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. The division was then stationed at Fort Bliss but was already preparing to move to the South West Pacific. The 1st Cavalry Division had therefore been dismounted, but the division and brigade commanders and their staffs were still on horseback. The 1st Cavalry Division staged at Camp Stoneman. Chase departed from San Francisco on 3 July on the transport . 
The 1st Cavalry Division arrived in Australia and continued its training at Strathpine, Queensland. Training there was more vigorous than at Fort Bliss, and Chase broke his heel bone in a training accident. In December 1943, the 1st Cavalry Division sailed for Oro Bay, where it staged for its next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign. Chase was chosen to lead the assault. Here, his tactical expertise came to the fore. He resisted the temptation to overrun the island of Los Negros, and thereby overextend his forces, and instead formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, he was able to defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison. The crisis passed, Chase's force was reinforced by the rest of the division, and the 1st Cavalry Division was then able to overrun the islands. Chase was awarded the Bronze Star for his role in the campaign.
The 1st Cavalry Division remained in the Admiralty Islands until October, when it boarded ships there for the invasion of Leyte, which it assaulted on 20 October 1944. Chase's 1st Brigade's initial mission was to reconnoiter the hills on the west side of the Tacloban Valley and establish observation posts from which it could command the entrances to the valley. In November, he was ordered to cover the flank of X Corps' advance up the Leyte Valley, and later into the Ormoc Valley. Chase had to move his brigade across mountainous, roadless, uncharted jungle in frequently appalling wet weather. The advance made slow progress against Japanese troops that fought tenaciously all the way.
The 1st Cavalry Division was down to half strength when it was withdrawn from the front line on Leyte for a brief rest in January 1945, but few reinforcements arrived before it was ordered to move to Luzon, where it disembarked over the beaches at San Fabian on 27 January 1945. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division's commander, Major General Vern D. Mudge, to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. For this, Mudge formed three flying columns. Initially, Chase's 1st Brigade's mission was to follow one of the columns but on 1 February he was relieved of responsibility for the main body of the 1st Brigade and placed in command of all three flying columns.
On 3 February, Chase's columns pushed into the northern outskirts of Manila and seized a vital bridge over the Tuliahan River, which separated them from the city proper. Chase, controlling his columns by radio, suffered slight burns to his hands when a Japanese truck exploded. A squadron of the 8th Cavalry, guided by two Filipino guerrillas reached the sprawling campus of the University of Santo Tomas which had been turned into an internment camp, liberating some 3,700 internees. 
A Japanese raiding party destroyed the bridge over Tuliahan River; Chase's security was not good enough. This prevented the main body of the 1st Cavalry Division from linking up with Chase's force in Manila. Supplies were dispatched through the 37th Infantry Division's zone until engineers could build a new bridge. For his advance on Manila, Chase was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He was also awarded the Purple Heart for the burns to his hands. 
On 7 February 1945, Chase took over command of the 38th Infantry Division, which was then confronted by enemy fortifications at Zig-Zag Pass on the Bataan Peninsula. It took Chase a week of hard fighting to reduce this position. A battalion of the 151st Infantry under Chase's personal command landed at Mariveles on the southern tip of Bataan on 14 February. The 38th Infantry Division participated in the final actions on Corregidor. Units of the 38th Infantry Division assaulted and captured Caballo Island on 27 March, Fort Drum on El Fraile Island on 13 April, and Carabao Island on 16 April. Meanwhile, other elements of the 38th Infantry Division engaged enemy forces in the mountainous Fort Stotsenburg area. In the midst of these operations, Chase was promoted to Major General in March. 
In late April 1945, the 38th Infantry Division moved to the area east of Manila where it relieved the 6th Infantry Division. On 1 May, it began a series of probing attacks prior to an attack on 4 May aimed at capturing the Wawa Dam, an important part of Manila's water supply. Chase had to reduce a series of strongly held Japanese positions. By the end of the month, the dam was secure and the Japanese "Kobayashi Force" was broken.
Chase assumed command of the 1st Cavalry Division on 1 August 1945. At this time, the division was in the Lucena City area but slated for Operation Downfall, in which it would assault Ariake, Kagoshima. The end of the war precluded this. Instead, the 1st Cavalry Division participated in the Occupation of Japan. It embarked from Batangas on 25 August and disembarked in Tokyo Bay on 2 September, becoming the first US division in Tokyo.
Later life.
Chase remained with the 1st Cavalry Division on occupation duties until December 1948, when he temporarily assumed command of IX Corps. He finally returned to the United States in January 1949, and became chief of staff of the Third Army at Fort McPherson in April 1949. From 1951 to 1955 he headed the Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan. He retired from the Army on 31 July 1955.
Chase earned a Master of Arts degree in history from Trinity University. From 1957 to 1965, he taught political science at the University of Houston. His wife Dorothea died in 1957. In 1961 he married Mrs Hallie Barlow Olcott. Chase retired in 1965, having reached the state of Texas' mandatory retirement age. In 1974, Chase joined a party of retired generals associated with General MacArthur on a visit to Australia as guests of Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring and Dame Mary Herring. In addition to Chase, Leif J. Sverdrup, Hugh John Casey, and LeGrande A. Diller and their wives also made the trip. Chase published his memoirs, entitled "Front Line General: The Commands of Maj. Gen. Wm. C. Chase", in 1975. He died on 21 August 1986 and was buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery.

Dark energy

In physical cosmology and astronomy, dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain observations since the 1990s that indicate that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. According to the Planck mission team, and based on the standard model of cosmology, on a mass–energy equivalence basis the universe contains 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy (for a total of 95.1%) and 4.9% ordinary matter. Again on a mass-energy equivalence basis, the density of dark energy (1.67 × 10−27 kg/m3) is very low: in the solar system, there are believed to be only 6 tons of dark energy within the radius of Pluto's orbit. However, it comes to dominate the mass-energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.
Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, a "constant" energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli, "dynamic" quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields which do change in space can be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant because the change may be extremely slow.
High-precision measurements of the expansion of the universe are required to understand how the expansion rate changes over time. In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is parameterized by the cosmological equation of state (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space). Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today.
Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard FLRW metric leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the "standard model" of cosmology because of its precise agreement with observations. Dark energy has been used as a crucial ingredient in a recent attempt to formulate a cyclic model for the universe.
Nature of dark energy.
Many things about the nature of dark energy remain matters of speculation. The evidence for dark energy is indirect but comes from three independent sources:
Dark energy is thought to be very homogeneous, not very dense and is not known to interact through any of the fundamental forces other than gravity. Since it is quite rarefied—roughly 10−29 g/cm3—it is unlikely to be detectable in laboratory experiments. Dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density, only because it uniformly fills otherwise empty space. The two leading models are a cosmological constant and quintessence. Both models include the common characteristic that dark energy must have negative pressure.
Effect of dark energy: a small constant negative pressure of vacuum.
Independently from its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure (acting repulsively) in order to explain the observed acceleration in the expansion rate of the universe.
According to General Relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other things just as its mass density does. This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the stress–energy tensor, which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure and viscosity.
In the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, it can be shown that a strong constant negative pressure in all the universe causes an acceleration in universe expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration in universe contraction if the universe is already contracting. More exactly, the second derivative of the universe scale factor, formula_1, is positive if the equation of state of the universe is such that formula_2.
This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled "gravitational repulsion", which is a colorful but possibly confusing expression. In fact a negative pressure does not influence the gravitational interaction between masses—which remains attractive—but rather alters the overall evolution of the universe at the cosmological scale, typically resulting in the accelerating expansion of the universe despite the attraction among the masses present in the universe.
The acceleration is simply a function of dark energy density. Dark energy is persistent: its density remains constant (experimentally, within a factor of 1:10), i.e. it does not get diluted when space expands.
Evidence of existence.
Supernovae.
In 1998, published observations of Type Ia supernovae ("one-A") by the High-z Supernova Search Team followed in 1999 by the Supernova Cosmology Project suggested that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt and Adam G. Riess for this work.
Since then, these observations have been corroborated by several independent sources. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and the large scale structure of the cosmos as well as improved measurements of supernovae have been consistent with the Lambda-CDM model. Some people argue that the only indication for the existence of dark energy is observations of distance measurements and associated redshifts. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies and baryon acoustic oscillations are only observations that redshifts are larger than expected from a "dusty" Friedmann–Lemaître universe and the local measured Hubble constant.
Supernovae are useful for cosmology because they are excellent standard candles across cosmological distances. They allow the expansion history of the Universe to be measured by looking at the relationship between the distance to an object and its redshift, which gives how fast it is receding from us. The relationship is roughly linear, according to Hubble's law. It is relatively easy to measure redshift, but finding the distance to an object is more difficult. Usually, astronomers use standard candles: objects for which the intrinsic brightness, the absolute magnitude, is known. This allows the object's distance to be measured from its actual observed brightness, or apparent magnitude. Type Ia supernovae are the best-known standard candles across cosmological distances because of their extreme and extremely consistent luminosity.
Recent observations of supernovae are consistent with a universe made up 71.3% of dark energy and 27.4% of a combination of dark matter and baryonic matter.
Cosmic microwave background.
The existence of dark energy, in whatever form, is needed to reconcile the measured geometry of space with the total amount of matter in the universe. Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies indicate that the universe is close to flat. For the shape of the universe to be flat, the mass/energy density of the universe must be equal to the critical density. The total amount of matter in the universe (including baryons and dark matter), as measured from the CMB spectrum, accounts for only about 30% of the critical density. This implies the existence of an additional form of energy to account for the remaining 70%. The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) spacecraft seven-year analysis estimated a universe made up of 72.8% dark energy, 22.7% dark matter and 4.5% ordinary matter.
Work done in 2013 based on the Planck spacecraft observations of the CMB gave a more accurate estimate of 68.3% of dark energy, 26.8% of dark matter and 4.9% of ordinary matter.
Large-scale structure.
The theory of large-scale structure, which governs the formation of structures in the universe (stars, quasars, galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters), also suggests that the density of matter in the universe is only 30% of the critical density.
A 2011 survey, the WiggleZ galaxy survey of more than 200,000 galaxies, provided further evidence towards the existence of dark energy, although the exact physics behind it remains unknown. The WiggleZ survey from Australian Astronomical Observatory scanned the galaxies to determine their redshift. Then, by exploiting the fact that baryon acoustic oscillations have left voids regularly of ~150 Mpc diameter, surrounded by the galaxies, the voids were used as standard rulers to determine distances to galaxies as far as 2,000 Mpc (redshift 0.6), which allowed astronomers to determine more accurately the speeds of the galaxies from their redshift and distance. The data confirmed cosmic acceleration up to half of the age of the universe (7 billion years) and constrain its inhomogeneity to 1 part in 10. This provides a confirmation to cosmic acceleration independent of supernovae.
Late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.
Accelerated cosmic expansion causes gravitational potential wells and hills to flatten as photons pass through them, producing cold spots and hot spots on the CMB aligned with vast supervoids and superclusters. This so-called late-time Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) is a direct signal of dark energy in a flat universe. It was reported at high significance in 2008 by Ho "et al." and Giannantonio "et al."
Observational Hubble constant data.
A new approach to test evidence of dark energy through observational Hubble constant (H(z)) data (OHD) has gained significant attention in recent years. The Hubble constant is measured as a function of cosmological redshift. OHD directly tracks the expansion history of the universe by taking passively evolving early-type galaxies as “cosmic chronometers”. From this point, this approach provides standard clocks in the universe. The core of this idea is the measurement of the differential age evolution as a function of redshift of these cosmic chronometers. Thus, it provides a direct estimate of the Hubble parameter H(z)=-1/(1+z)dz/dt≈-1/(1+z)Δz/Δt. The merit of this approach is clear: the reliance on a differential quantity, Δz/Δt, can minimize many common issues and systematic effects; and as a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter instead of its integral, like supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), it brings more information and is appealing in computation. For these reasons, it has been widely used to examine the accelerated cosmic expansion and study properties of dark energy.
Theories of explanation.
Cosmological constant.
The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is simply the "cost of having space": that is, a volume of space has some intrinsic, fundamental energy. This is the cosmological constant, sometimes called Lambda (hence Lambda-CDM model) after the Greek letter Λ, the symbol used to represent this quantity mathematically. Since energy and mass are related by "E" = "mc"2, Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that this energy will have a gravitational effect. It is sometimes called a vacuum energy because it is the energy density of empty vacuum. In fact, most theories of particle physics predict vacuum fluctuations that would give the vacuum this sort of energy. This is related to the Casimir Effect, in which there is a small suction into regions where virtual particles are geometrically inhibited from forming (e.g. between plates with tiny separation). The cosmological constant is estimated by cosmologists to be on the order of 10−29 g/cm3, or about 10−120 in reduced Planck units. Particle physics predicts a natural value of 1 in reduced Planck units, leading to a large discrepancy.
The cosmological constant has negative pressure equal to its energy density and so causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. The reason why a cosmological constant has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics; Energy must be lost from inside a container to do work on the container. A change in volume "dV" requires work done equal to a change of energy −"P dV", where "P" is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a container full of vacuum actually increases when the volume increases ("dV" is positive), because the energy is equal to "ρV", where "ρ" (rho) is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, "P" is negative and, in fact, "P" = −"ρ".
A major outstanding problem is that most quantum field theories predict a huge cosmological constant from the energy of the quantum vacuum, more than 100 orders of magnitude too large. This would need to be cancelled almost, but not exactly, by an equally large term of the opposite sign. Some supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which does not help because supersymmetry must be broken. The present scientific consensus amounts to extrapolating the empirical evidence where it is relevant to predictions, and fine-tuning theories until a more elegant solution is found. Technically, this amounts to checking theories against macroscopic observations. Unfortunately, as the known error-margin in the constant predicts the fate of the universe more than its present state, many such "deeper" questions remain unknown.
In spite of its problems, the cosmological constant is in many respects the most economical solution to the problem of cosmic acceleration. One number successfully explains a multitude of observations. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, includes the cosmological constant as an essential feature.
Quintessence.
In quintessence models of dark energy, the observed acceleration of the scale factor is caused by the potential energy of a dynamical field, referred to as quintessence field. Quintessence differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In order for it not to clump and form structure like matter, the field must be very light so that it has a large Compton wavelength.
No evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's equivalence principle and variation of the fundamental constants in space or time. Scalar fields are predicted by the standard model and string theory, but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of cosmic inflation) occurs: renormalization theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses.
The cosmic coincidence problem asks why the cosmic acceleration began when it did. If cosmic acceleration began earlier in the universe, structures such as galaxies would never have had time to form and life, at least as we know it, would never have had a chance to exist. Proponents of the anthropic principle view this as support for their arguments. However, many models of quintessence have a so-called tracker behavior, which solves this problem. In these models, the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than) the radiation density until matter-radiation equality, which triggers quintessence to start behaving as dark energy, eventually dominating the universe. This naturally sets the low energy scale of the dark energy.
In 2004, when scientists fit the evolution of dark energy with the cosmological data, they found that the equation of state had possibly crossed the cosmological constant boundary (w=−1) from above to below. A No-Go theorem has been proved that gives this scenario at least two degrees of freedom as required for dark energy models. This scenario is so-called Quintom scenario.
Some special cases of quintessence are phantom energy, in which the energy density of quintessence actually increases with time, and k-essence (short for kinetic quintessence) which has a non-standard form of kinetic energy. They can have unusual properties: phantom energy, for example, can cause a Big Rip.
Alternative ideas.
Some alternatives to dark energy aim to explain the observational data by a more refined use of established theories, focusing, for example, on the gravitational effects of density inhomogeneities, or on consequences of electroweak symmetry breaking in the early universe. If we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration. A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the equivalence principle to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster. While weak, such effects considered cumulatively over billions of years could become significant, creating the illusion of cosmic acceleration, and making it appear as if we live in a Hubble bubble.
Another class of theories attempts to come up with an all-encompassing theory of both dark matter and dark energy as a single phenomenon that modifies the laws of gravity at various scales. An example of this type of theory is the theory of dark fluid. Another class of theories that unifies dark matter and dark energy are suggested to be covariant theories of modified gravities. These theories alter the dynamics of the space-time such that the modified dynamic stems what have been assigned to the presence of dark energy and dark matter.
A 2011 paper in the journal Physical Review D by Christos Tsagas, a cosmologist at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, argued that it is likely that the accelerated expansion of the universe is an illusion caused by the relative motion of us to the rest of the universe. The paper cites data showing that the 2.5 billion ly wide region of space we are inside of is moving very quickly relative to everything around it. If the theory is confirmed, then dark energy would not exist (but the "dark flow" still might).
Some theorists think that dark energy and cosmic acceleration are a failure of general relativity on very large scales, larger than superclusters. However most attempts at modifying general relativity have turned out to be either equivalent to theories of quintessence, or inconsistent with observations. Other ideas for dark energy have come from string theory, brane cosmology and the holographic principle, but have not yet proved as compellingly as quintessence and the cosmological constant.
On string theory, an article in the journal "Nature" described:
Paul Steinhardt in the same article criticizes string theory's explanation of dark energy stating "...Anthropics and randomness don't explain anything... I am disappointed with what most theorists are willing to accept".
Another set of proposals is based on the possibility of a double metric tensor for space-time. It has been argued that time reversed solutions in general relativity require such double metric for consistency, and that both dark matter and dark energy can be understood in terms of time reversed solutions of general relativity.
Implications for the fate of the universe.
Cosmologists estimate that the acceleration began roughly 5 billion years ago. Before that, it is thought that the expansion was decelerating, due to the attractive influence of dark matter and baryons. The density of dark matter in an expanding universe decreases more quickly than dark energy, and eventually the dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the volume of the universe doubles, the density of dark matter is halved, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant in the case of a cosmological constant).
If the acceleration continues indefinitely, the ultimate result will be that galaxies outside the local supercluster will have a line-of-sight velocity that continually increases with time, eventually far exceeding the speed of light. This is not a violation of special relativity because the notion of "velocity" used here is different from that of velocity in a local inertial frame of reference, which is still constrained to be less than the speed of light for any massive object (see Uses of the proper distance for a discussion of the subtleties of defining any notion of relative velocity in cosmology). Because the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, there can actually be cases where a galaxy that is receding from us faster than light does manage to emit a signal which reaches us eventually. However, because of the accelerating expansion, it is projected that most galaxies will eventually cross a type of cosmological event horizon where any light they emit past that point will never be able to reach us at any time in the infinite future because the light never reaches a point where its "peculiar velocity" toward us exceeds the expansion velocity away from us (these two notions of velocity are also discussed in Uses of the proper distance). Assuming the dark energy is constant (a cosmological constant), the current distance to this cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light years, meaning that a signal from an event happening "at present" would eventually be able to reach us in the future if the event were less than 16 billion light years away, but the signal would never reach us if the event were more than 16 billion light years away.
As galaxies approach the point of crossing this cosmological event horizon, the light from them will become more and more redshifted, to the point where the wavelength becomes too large to detect in practice and the galaxies appear to disappear completely ("see" Future of an expanding universe). The Earth, the Milky Way, and the Virgo supercluster, however, would remain virtually undisturbed while the rest of the universe recedes and disappears from view. In this scenario, the local supercluster would ultimately suffer heat death, just as was thought for the flat, matter-dominated universe before measurements of cosmic acceleration.
There are some very speculative ideas about the future of the universe. One suggests that phantom energy causes "divergent" expansion, which would imply that the effective force of dark energy continues growing until it dominates all other forces in the universe. Under this scenario, dark energy would ultimately tear apart all gravitationally bound structures, including galaxies and solar systems, and eventually overcome the electrical and nuclear forces to tear apart atoms themselves, ending the universe in a "Big Rip". On the other hand, dark energy might dissipate with time or even become attractive. Such uncertainties leave open the possibility that gravity might yet rule the day and lead to a universe that contracts in on itself in a "Big Crunch". Some scenarios, such as the cyclic model, suggest this could be the case. It is also possible the universe may never have an end and continue in its present state forever (see The Second Law as a law of disorder). While these ideas are not supported by observations, they are not ruled out.
History of discovery and previous speculation.
The cosmological constant was first proposed by Einstein as a mechanism to obtain a solution of the gravitational field equation that would lead to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity. Not only was the mechanism an inelegant example of fine-tuning but it was also later realized that Einstein's static universe would actually be unstable because local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead to either the runaway expansion or contraction of the universe. The equilibrium is unstable: If the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting. These sorts of disturbances are inevitable, due to the uneven distribution of matter throughout the universe. More importantly, observations made by Edwin Hubble in 1929 showed that the universe appears to be expanding and not static at all. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to predict the idea of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest blunder.
Alan Guth and Alexei Starobinsky proposed in 1980 that a negative pressure field, similar in concept to dark energy, could drive cosmic inflation in the very early universe. Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of the universe slightly after the Big Bang. Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang. However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher energy density than the dark energy we observe today and is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old. It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation. Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.
Nearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the critical density. During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% cold dark matter and 5% ordinary matter (baryons). These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: notably, the model required a value for the Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering. These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background by the COBE spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the Lambda-CDM model and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model. The first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations in 1998 of accelerated expansion in Riess "et al." and in Perlmutter "et al.", and the Lambda-CDM model then became the leading model. Soon after, dark energy was supported by independent observations: in 2000, the Boomerang and Maxima cosmic microwave background experiments observed the first acoustic peak in the CMB, showing that the total (matter+energy) density is close to 100% of critical density. Then in 2001, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey gave strong evidence that the matter density is around 30% of critical. The large difference between these two supports a smooth component of dark energy making up the difference. Much more precise measurements from WMAP in 2003-2010 have continued to support the standard model and give more accurate measurements of the key parameters.
The term "dark energy", echoing Fritz Zwicky's "dark matter" from the 1930s, was coined by Michael Turner in 1998.
As of 2013, the Lambda-CDM model is consistent with a series of increasingly rigorous cosmological observations, including the Planck spacecraft and the Supernova Legacy Survey. First results from the SNLS reveal that the average behavior (i.e., equation of state) of dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological constant to a precision of 10%. Recent results from the Hubble Space Telescope Higher-Z Team indicate that dark energy has been present for at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration.

Mahir al-Zubaydi

Mahir al-Zubaydi (died October 3, 2008 in Adhamiya, Baghdad, Iraq), also known as Abu Assad or Abu Rami, was a key al-Qaeda military commander. Zubaydi is believed to have headed the group behind bombings which killed at least 16 people in Baghdad in October 2008. The U.S. military says Zubaydi was suspected in several other attacks against Iraqis and U.S. forces in past years. Zubaydi also took part in a videotaped killing of four Russian diplomats in June 2006.
Death.
US troops targeted Zubaydi on October 3, 2008, after receiving intelligence following bombings in Baghdad against Shia Muslim mosques. Troops tracked him down to a house in the Adhamiya district of Baghdad, a strongly Sunni Muslim area, surrounded the building and used loud speakers to order him to surrender. The Americans say he responded by shooting at them, so they shot him. A woman reported to be his wife was also killed.

The hospital provides tertiary care to more than twenty million people in the southern part of Tamil Nadu. The hospital was established in 1842 and became a teaching hospital in 1954. The hospital was formerly known as ERSKINE'S HOSPITAL. Madurai Medical College is affiliated to The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University and is recognised by the World Health Organization.
The college was inaugurated on August 2, 1954 by the then chief minister K.Kamaraj and the then union health minister Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. K.P.Sarathy was the first special officer and Sarah J Sowri, the first principal. The college was first affiliated to the University of Madras and permanent recognition was accorded in 1954. Subsequently the Medical Council of India’s recognition came in 1961.
The college was then situated at the Old Taluk building, Fair weather road. The present building was occupied in 1958. In 1963 C.K.Padmanaba Menon became its first Dean. The college has stood the test of time. It celebrated the silver jubilee in 1979 and golden jubilee in 2004.
When the Madurai Kamaraj University was established, the college was affiliated to it. And when the Tamil Nadu Dr.MGR Medical University was started, the college like other medical colleges in the state was affiliated to it.
The college is spread over an area of 18.93 acres, with 360 teaching staff.
The college is a collage of medical talent, spirit of research, availability of advanced infrastructure and sound record in various specialities of Medicine.
Courses.
Courses offered include Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery(MBBS), Bachelor of Pharmacy (B.Pharm), Master of Pharmacy (M.Pharm), Diploma in Pharmacy (D.pharm), Nursing, and other para-medical courses. Selection is based on performance in the Higher Secondary (School) Certificate. Admission is based strictly on merit and the reservation policies enforced by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The college also offers Post graduate degrees in all medical and surgical specialities (Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery), Post Graduate Diplomas (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, DCH, DGO, DLO etc.) and some super speciliaties.
Madurai medical college is one of the oldest medical college next to Madras Medical college and is a famous medical college in south Tamil Nadu.
Clinical Services.
Clinical Services are provided by the Government Rajaji Hospital which is a 1691 bedded Super Speciality Hospital providing free health care to people in the lower income group.
It was opened in 1842 and moved into its present premises on August 31, 1940. It was named after Lord Erskine (Governor of Madras Presidency in 1930s) as he contributed a lot to the hospital growth. The Erskine Hospital was inaugurated in November 1940 by Sir Arthur Hope, the then Governor of Madras. In 1956 the hospital became a teaching hospital, being attached to our college. It was renamed as Government Rajaji Hospital in January 1980. 
Departments.
Department of Anatomy.
The Anatomy dept. was functioning in a shed before the present building was built.It was when Dr. T.S. Chelvakumaran was the Prof. the dept. shifted to the 2nd floor of the main building. There was a separate body lift from the ground floor to the dissection hall which is one of the biggest and had marble tables.
The dissection hall was in the old building near the mess hall. Later in the year 1958 the anatomy dept was shifted to the new building.
Department of Neurosurgery.
Neurosugery department is one of the oldest department in Madurai Medical College. The department of neurosurgery Madurai Medical College, an icon in the development of medical science, was born in 1962, the third of its kind in India next to Chennai and Calcutta, started by a doyen neurosurgeon professor "Dr M Natarajan".The department has been the referral centre for the whole of south Tamil Nadu.

Upstairs at The Gatehouse is a small pub theatre in Highgate in the London Borough of Camden.
The venue is a refurbished 1895 auditorium, upstairs from the "Gatehouse" pub, that has served over the years as a music hall, cinema, Masonic lodge, and a jazz and folk music club that once hosted a performance by Paul Simon. Today, the venue hosts theatrical and cabaret productions. It has presented a mix of off-beat and mainstream shows, including an all-female version of "Hamlet", modernistic interpretation of opera classics and new musicals and dramas. 
In 2012 they staged a sellout run of "Guys and Dolls" as well as a new stageplay "Iceberg - Right Ahead!" to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the maiden voyage of RMS "Titanic".
In July 2013 a revival of Noël Coward's 1956 satirical comedy Nude with Violin had a three-week run staged by the Logos Theatre Company.
Upstairs at the Gatehouse is run by Ovation Theatres Limited, whose two directors John and Katie Plews have served for over twenty years. The "Gatehouse" pub is a Wetherspoon property.

Raphael Mechoulam

Raphael Mechoulam () (born 1930) is an Israeli professor of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. Mechoulam is best known for his work (together with Y. Gaoni) in the isolation, structure elucidation and total synthesis of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active principle of cannabis and for the isolation and the identification of 
the endogenous cannabinoids anandamide from the brain and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) from peripheral organs together with his students, postdocs and collaborators.
Early life and education.
Raphael Mechoulam was born in Sofia, Bulgaria on November 5, 1930. His father was a physician and head of a local hospital, while his mother "who had studied in Berlin, enjoyed the life of a well-to-do Jewish family". He attended an "American Grade School" until his parents were forced to leave their hometown because of anti-semitic laws and his father was subsequently sent to a concentration camp, from which he survived. After the communist takeover of hitherto pro-German Bulgaria in 1944 he studied chemical engineering, which he "disliked." In 1949 his family immigrated to Israel where he later studied chemistry. He gained his first research experience in the Israeli Army working on insecticides. He finished his PhD thesis on the chemistry of steroids under the supervision of Prof. Franz Sondheimer in 1950s. After a postdoctoral stay at the Rockefeller Institute with Prof. S. William Pelletier he became a junior member at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
Academic career.
Raphael Mechoulam, while being a junior member at the Weizmann Institute of Science, succeeded in the isolation, structure elucidation and total synthesis of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active principle of marijuana. He later became a full professor for medicinal chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he established the "Department of Natural Products". His major scientific interest is the chemistry and pharmacology of cannabinoids. He and his research group succeeded in the total synthesis of the major plant cannabinoids Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabigerol and various others. Another research project initiated by him led to the isolation of the first described endocannabinoid anandamide which was isolated and characterized by two of his postdoctoral researchers, Lumír Ondřej Hanuš and William Devane. Another endogenous cannabinoid, 2-AG, was soon discovered by Shimon Ben-Shabat, one of his PhD students. He published more than 350 scientific articles.

A toffee hammer is a very small hammer designed for breaking up sheets or slabs of hard toffee, such as bonfire toffee, into small pieces suitable for consumption. A toffee hammer is sometimes included as a novelty item in gift packs produced by toffee manufacturers.
Toffee hammers were used by suffragettes, in particular members of the Women's Social and Political Union, for breaking windows as a form of protest during their campaign for votes for women.
The term "toffee hammer" may also be used to refer to any unusually small hammer, for example in orthopedic surgery,

Human defecation postures

Humans can defecate in a number of defecation postures. The two most common are the "squatting defecation posture" and the "sitting defecation posture". The squatting posture is used for squat toilets; it is also commonly used for defecation in the absence of toilets or other devices. The sitting defecation posture is used in Western toilets, with a lean-forward posture or a 90-degrees posture. In general, the posture chosen is largely a cultural decision. The defecation posture chosen by an individual may affect certain medical conditions, such as defecation syncope (fainting while defecating), as well as urination.
Anorectal angle.
Some authors believe that the anorectal angle (ARA), the angle formed by the junction of the rectum with the anus, is "one of the most important contributions to anal continence"; its normal value at rest is 90 degrees.
According to a 1996 article in the "Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients",
In persons with anismus the anorectal angle during attempted defecation is typically abnormal. This is due to abnormal movement of the puborectalis muscle, a hallmark of anismus.
Sitting defecation posture.
The sitting defecation posture involves sitting with hips and knees at approximately right angles, as on a chair. Most Western-style flush toilets are designed to be used with a sitting posture. The sitting posture is more widespread in the Western world, and less common in the developing world. Toilet seats are a recent development, only coming into widespread use in the nineteenth century.
Advantages and health benefits.
The sitting position helps protect privacy and leaves little or no chance of getting fecal matter on clothes or ankles. It may feel more comfortable as it can minimize strain in thighs, calves, ankles and lower back . Breathing is also easier while sitting than squatting.
Disadvantages and health risks.
The sitting position causes the defecating human to assume a narrow anorectal angle, which some people believe is obstructive and causes difficulty in emptying the bowels. Critics of this posture say that squatting is "the only natural defecation posture".
The sitting position can cause the defecating human being to repeat the Valsalva maneuver many times and with great force, which may overload the cardiovascular system and cause defecation syncope. Sikirov also published 2004 study in which he compared the length of time needed to defecate using various postures, and concluded that the sitting defecation posture requires "excessive expulsive effort compared to the squatting posture".
A sitting posture may increase diverticulosis of the colon. The magnitude of straining during defecation is at least three times greater than with the squatting posture.
Squatting defecation posture.
The squatting defecation posture involves squatting by standing with knees and hips sharply bent and the buttocks suspended near the ground. Squat toilets are designed to facilitate this posture. It is more widespread in the developing world than in the Western world. In the US, the squatting position is colloquially known as the "catcher's position" or the "catcher's posture" because of its similarity to the posture that baseball players must maintain while playing the catcher position. The phrase "catcher's position" has been widely credited to Dr. M. K. Rizk, a US physician and researcher in the field of modern gastroenterology, and major proponent of the squatting defecation posture.
Advantages and health benefits.
Squatting can be beneficial for patients suffering from the spastic pelvic floor syndrome, due to the increased anorectal angle enabled by the posture.
Defecation postures in space.
Related to work on a zero gravity toilet for use in the space station, there is no evidence that posture affects the ease of urination.

Pink lake

A pink lake is a lake that has a red or pink colour usually due to the presence of algae that produces carotenoids, such as "Dunaliella salina". 
Examples include Pink Lake, near Esperance, Western Australia; Hutt Lagoon and in midwest Western Australia; and Lac Rose in Senegal. Lake Hillier in Australia has a pink coloration, but the cause of the coloration is currently unknown.

Samuel Ndhlovu

Samuel Ndhlovu (27 September 1937 – 10 October 2001) was a Zambian footballer and coach. Nicknamed "Zoom," he led the “Mighty” Mufulira Wanderers to unparalleled league and cup triumphs for almost two decades. He was named Zambian Sportsman of the Year in 1964 and also served the national team with distinction as captain and coach. He is widely regarded as Zambia’s best local coach.
Early life.
Ndhlovu was born in Luanshya and moved to Mufulira as a boy when his family settled there. At the age of eight, he formed his own team with friends of a similar age and they played in the streets or any open ground, against bigger lads and almost always got beaten. He went to Kankoyo Mine School where he excelled in various sport disciplines and it was from there that he joined the Mufulira Mine Team in 1956. The team later changed its name to Mufulira Wanderers Football Club.
Playing career.
By 1959, Ndhlovu was co-opted into the welfare section of mine community development as a club organizer and it was in the same year that he found his feet and became a lynchpin at Wanderers. He earned the nickname "Zoom" when a Wanderers fan who could not fathom how easily he dribbled past defenders started calling him ‘Sumu’ instead of ‘Sam.’ This eventually changed to "Zoom" which would become one of the most famous nicknames in Zambian soccer history. It virtually became part of his name with many referring to him simply as ‘Zoom Ndhlovu’.
Ndhlovu experienced segregation in pre-colonial Northern Rhodesia where two leagues ran side by side – one for whites and one for the Africans. He was the ultimate entertainer for his skill on the ball, close control and deadly shooting were a marvel to witness and few Zambian soccer fans could claim to have never heard of the name "Zoom". 
In 1960 he became Wanderers’ captain and after missing out on the inaugural Zambian National Football League championship of 1962 which was won by Roan United, Wanderers won the title the following year. 
Ndhlovu’s eye-catching performances in the number 10 shirt for both Wanderers and Zambia made him very popular throughout the country and he was rewarded with the Zambian Sportsman of the Year award for 1964. 
In 1965 Wanderers defeated City of Lusaka 5-2 in the Castle Cup final and this qualified them to meet the Castle Cup winners from Southern Rhodesia in the Inter-Rhodesia Castle Cup final. Apart from the prize money of £590, the match carried extra motivation as no Zambian club had won it before and a decision had been taken to do away with the cup by having one last final, after which the winners would keep the trophy for good. 
Wanderers crossed the Zambezi River to square off with City Wanderers on 17 October 1965 at Glamis Stadium in Salisbury. The final turned out to be one of the most famous matches in Zambian football history as the Mighty men lined up before a racially segregated crowd of 18,000. The Zambians took the lead with two quick goals from Willie Kunda and Elijah Mwale but City pulled a goal back through striker Kenneth Makoni. Man of the match Ndhlovu put Wanderers further ahead to leave the scores 3-1 at the break. Wanderers then allowed City back into the game when goals by captain Alan Hlathwayo and Richard Chimiya tied the score line and with extra-time looming, Mwale cut in from the left to score a late and historic winner for a final score of 4-3. Ndhlovu called winning the Super Castle Cup was one of the greatest moments of his career.
On 1 June 1966, a benefit match between Wanderers and Kitwe Sports was held in Kitwe to honour Ndhlovu’s ten years in football and he scored in the 1-1 draw. Later that month, he travelled to England for six weeks to watch the World Cup after which he attended an English FA coaching course in Durham and also trained with English First Division club Blackpool. Later that year, Wanderers retained the Castle Cup with another extra-time win over Kabwe Warriors after coming from behind twice. He scored the goal that tied the game at 3-3 and took it into extra time, and the fifth goal in a 5-3 victory in a match where Warriors curiously wore shirts with no numbers.
Ndlhovu had a chance to play professional football in 1967 after former Wanderers coach Doug Sammons arranged a stint for him with Atlanta Chiefs in the United States, together with Howard Mwikuta, Freddie Mwila and Emment Kapengwe but he turned down the opportunity to concentrate on developing the game in Zambia, and also due to uncertainty over the legality of the league. As a consequence, the other three became Zambia’s first professionals abroad and Chiefs manager Phil Woosnam expressed his disappointment that Ndhlovu would not get to showcase his skills in the newly formed PSL, after drawing coast-to-coast press notices as a result of careful feeding by Woosnam and his publicity department.
For such a talented player whose career spanned three decades - from the 1950s to the 70s - it was not surprising that he would go on to become the most honoured performer of his generation, making Wanderers the ‘winningest team’ in Zambian club soccer, and in the process climbing the rostrum to receive honours far more times than any other player.
With Ndhlovu as captain, Wanderers won the Zambian league championship in 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1969 and numerous cup competitions and earned the tag ‘legendary cup fighters.’
Ndhlovu’s popularity was such that he was featured on adverts for various products and on 25 October 1973, he was bestowed with the Insignia of Honour by President Kenneth Kaunda for his service to Zambian football, the first footballer to get such an award.
Ndhlovu was still playing for Wanderers in 1975 as player-coach, scoring in a 1-1 draw with Uganda’s Express in the East and Central Africa Club championship in Kampala though he did not feature much in Wanderers line-up after that. In September of that same year the Wanderers maestro made another appearance when his experience was called upon in the African Club Champions cup quarter-final against Tonnerre Yaounde of Cameroun but his presence did not help as Wanderers lost the first leg 1-0 on a goal by Roger Milla in Yaounde and were eliminated 3-2 on aggregate.
After a long career spanning three decades, Ndhlovu finally called time on his career and concentrated on coaching.
National Team.
Ndhlovu first featured for Northern Rhodesia in 1956, making his debut against a Congolese Select side as an eighteen yearold. Although there were strong protests against his selection as people felt he was too young, he scored two goals in a match which he described as though he were playing in a dream. He was in the Zambian national team at independence in October 1964 and was reported to have made more appearances than any other Zambian player at the time. He won the Kenya Republic Cup in 1964, the Rothmans International trophy against Kenya in 1965 and the Heroes Cup against Uganda in 1968. 
He was made Zambian captain in 1965, replacing Jackie Sewell. In June 1967 he was succeeded by Dickson Makwaza as captain and in December of the same year was handed coaching duties, leading Zambia to a victorious Jamhuri Cup outing in Kenya as player-coach. 
He however made a comeback for the national team in December 1968 in a CAN 1970 qualifier against Mauritius in Port Louis after Zambia drew the first leg 2-2 in Lusaka. Zambia won 3-2 and qualified to the next round where they faced Cameroun.
Yet again Zambia could only settle for a 2-2 home draw with Ndhlovu scoring the opening goal. They lost the return leg 2-1 in Yaounde and it proved to be Ndhlovu’s last game for his country. Immediately upon arrival from Cameroun, it was reported that Ndhlovu’s conduct during a reception for the team after the match had upset the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) officials and he was suspended from national team matches for the rest of the year and fined.
Ndhlovu defended his behaviour on the Camerounian trip and the matter dragged on in the press and he even considered quitting football altogether as it 'was not the only sport that he could play.' In the end, he apologised for his actions and paid the fine and his ban was lifted.
He made 21 international appearances for Zambia scoring 8 goals from 1964 to 1969.
Coaching career.
Ndhlovu got involved in coaching at Wanderers from as early as 1966 when he became player coach replacing Harry McQuillan. From then on, he was involved as player-coach, coach or technical advisor.
Ndhlovu was first appointed national team trainer in 1967 for a trip to Tanzania in July but was unable to make the trip due to work commitments. He however first handled the national team in December of the same year during the Jamhuri tournament against Kenya in Nairobi, at the age of 30 making him the youngest coach to take charge of Zambia in a full international match. Zambia won the two match series 5-1 and 4-3. Ndhlovu also took charge of Zambia as player-coach for a trip to Uganda in October the following year.
He was appointed national player-coach again when a team was assembled to play Congo DR in Kinshasa. This invitation coincided with the visit of Russian team Leningrad Zeniths. FAZ officials accepted the Congolese offer and decided to send an under-strength team to Kinshasa. The result was Zambia’s heaviest defeat on 22 November 1969 with Congo romping to a 10-1 victory. Ndhlovu said this was the worst game of his career and he was so shattered that he could not eat after the game.
During the seventies, he was Wanderers Technical Advisor as the coaching role changed from George Sikazwe to Makwaza and in 1982 he took over as coach after Makwaza resigned. He went on to nurture players like Ashols Melu, Efford Chabala, Kalusha Bwalya, Charles Musonda and Johnson Bwalya. He was also the assistant coach to Bill McGarry, Wieslaw Grawboski and Geoff Butler and when the Zambia Football Coaches Association (ZAFCA) was formed, he was elected chairman. 
He succeeded Butler as Overseer for Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) sponsored club coaches in February 1987and did a lot to motivate many local coaches. He commanded a lot of respect from players and fellow coaches and was called ‘Sir Zoom.’
After Zambia performed disastrously at the CAN ‘86 and Coach Brightwell Banda was sidelined, Ndhlovu took over the reins. His first game was an All Africa Games qualifier against Malawi in April 1987 in Lusaka which Zambia won 3-1. 
Ndhlovu guided Zambia to the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988 after a 2-1 aggregate win over Ghana, where they were given no chance of progressing from a group containing Italy, Venezuela and Iraq. Zambia defied the odds by topping the group to make it to the quarter-finals after beating both Italy and Venezuela by 4-0 score-lines. They however lost in the quarter-finals to West Germany by the same margin. 
Ndhlovu was a proponent of the attacking game and under him Zambia recorded impressive results. He had an exceptional home record but his Achilles’ heel was that he could never get a result away from home when it really mattered. 
After the Olympic Games, many expected Zambia to qualify to Italia ‘90 but it was not to be as the team won all its home games but failed to collect a single point on the road. The disappointment of missing out on the World Cup was put behind them at CAN ‘90 in Algeria where Zambia finished third.
Ndhlovu won the SADCC Cup with Zambia, beating Zimbabwe 3-1 in Gaborone in August 1990 and he led Zambia to a CECAFA Cup victory in Uganda the following year.
At the 1992 Cup of Nations Zambia disappointed yet again, losing in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Côte d'Ivoire and the team arrived home to a barrage of criticism with fans calling for his resignation. One accusation levelled at him was that he favoured certain local players at the expense of one or two European based professionals. Ndhlovu appealed for calm and reminded fans that 'emotions never win a war.' "Fans must appreciate in football there are losses, wins and defeats. Even if you bring an angel Zambia will experience defeat one time or another." He refused to step down saying he was the best man for the job and resisted calls for German coach Jochen Figge, who at the time was attached to the Ministry of Sport as a Development Officer, to join the squad. Ndhlovu later relented and said he was ready to work with Figge who politely declined.
The criticism against him continued until he suddenly announced his resignation in July 1992, citing criticism from the media and lack of appreciation from fans. He was particularly incensed by a popular radio programme which questioned his reluctance to step aside and give chance to others.
This left the FAZ in a quandary and when Zambia kicked off the 1994 Nations Cup qualifiers unconvincingly with Figge as Technical Advisor and Simutowe as coach, struggling to overcome Mauritius 2-1 at home and defeating newcomers South Africa 1-0 in Johannesburg, Ndhlovu bounced back into the saddle for the 1994 World Cup qualifiers with a convincing 2-0 home victory against Tanzania in Lusaka and a 4-0 win over Namibia in Windhoek. He also led Zambia to third place at that year’s CECAFA tournament with an 8-0 thumping of Zanzibar along the way. However a 2-0 loss away to Madagascar in a World Cup qualifier in December 1992 spelt the end of his reign as coach, only finding out when the FAZ announced in the press that he had been sacked and replaced with a new coaching team of Simwala, Godfrey Chitalu and Alex Chola. He said he was not surprised with the move charging that his dismissal was a fulfilment of a campaign pledge by the newly elected FAZ executive.
Ndhlovu then packed his bags and headed for Lobatse in Botswana where he took charge of one of the country’s top clubs LCS Gunners. As a consequence, he was not with the Zambian squad during the fateful flight in April 1993 when the whole team was wiped out in the Gabon disaster. He heard of the plane crash in Botswana and reflected that he would have been on that aircraft had he not decided to come to Botswana after falling out with the FAZ officials. "I do not know whether I should say I am lucky, but because I had disagreements with those fellows, I decided to come here to take up an appointment as Lobatse Extension Gunners coach," he said. He went on to win the league with the Gunners in 1994 and returned home in 1996 when he decided not to renew his contract. 
Ndhlovu, who worked as a Community Development Officer and then as Chief Community Development Officer for Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) in Mufulira was not for the idea of being employed as full-time coach and he rendered his services to the nation on secondment from ZCCM.
During his time as coach from 1987-1992 he was in charge of Zambia for more matches than any other coach, suffering only 1 home defeat in a 2-1 loss to Egypt in December 1988 in Kitwe and won all his competitive home games. Of the 22 home matches he won 19 drew 2 and lost 1. Of the 66 games played away from home, Zambia won 28 times, drew 16 and lost 22. He had a win rate of 53%.
However, he made another comeback but this time as Technical Advisor when in November 1996, the Government and the FAZ could not reach an agreement with Roald Poulsen over a new contract and Freddie Mwila was appointed coach. The duo’s reign was short-lived as they resigned on 11 April 1997 when Zambia failed to beat Zaire in a World Cup qualifier, drawing 2-2 in Harare. George Mungwa took over as caretaker coach but he could not save Zambia’s campaign as South Africa grabbed the only ticket to France ‘98 in the group.
Ndhlovu then went back to Mufulira to help out at Wanderers and took a low profile until 2000 when he contested the FAZ presidency but lost to Evaristo Kasunga by a landslide margin. He returned to Wanderers as coach and cleared out most of the old guard in preference for youth and paid the price when Wanderers were thrashed 5-0 at home by Zanaco in the first game of the season. When Wanderers’ went 9 games without a win, he was relieved of his duties and replaced by George Lwandamina. At the end of the season, Wanderers were relegated from the Premier league but were saved by a boardroom decision when Rail Express FC, one of the teams that finished above them was disbanded so they continued in the top league.
Other Sports.
Ndhlovu was more than a footballer but was an all-round sportsman. According to former FAZ General Secretary Bennet Simfukwe, Ndhlovu was Northern Rhodesian champion in long jump, high jump and pole vault, and Ndhlovu, Simfukwe and Owen Nkhama were the only black African members of the 1961 Northern Rhodesian basketball team that toured Southern Rhodesia and other British colonies. He was also a good boxer but decided it was rough and switched to soccer and joined Mufulira Mine Team.
Ndhlovu was also an accomplished golfer, a single figure handicap with a consistent and athletic swing. He was a popular member of Mufulira Golf Club and served on the management committee for many years. At a time when Zambians were in the minority in the club as a consequence of financial limitations, he was notable for his support of talented young Zambian golfers.
Death.
Ndhlovu first experienced poor health in February 2000 when he collapsed during a training session at Central Sports Stadium in Mufulira.
In February 2001, he underwent an operation to remove a tumour from his large intestine but his battle with cancer continued until he succumbed and died at Malcolm Watson Hospital in Mufulira on 10 October 2001.
Activities in Mufulira came to a standstill as several former and present Wanderers players were joined by other mourners in paying their last respects to the super footballer called "Zoom." After a requiem mass at Shinde Stadium, he was put to rest at Chatulinga Cemetery next to his daughter with a burial befitting that of a hero. He was survived by a wife and two sons. 
Then Sports Minister Peter Chintala said the country had lost one of its greatest sporting heroes and former teammate Makwaza said ‘Ever since I knew him he was just superb.’ Kalusha Bwalya described him as a great player and true legend who set him on his way to fame. 
In 2002, the Zambian season-opening Charity Shield was renamed the Samuel "Zoom" Ndhlovu Charity Shield in his honour.

The Zero Hour (radio series)

The Zero Hour (aka Hollywood Radio Theater) was a 1973-74 radio drama anthology series hosted by Rod Serling. With tales of mystery, adventure and suspense, the program aired in stereo for two seasons. Some of the scripts were written by Serling.
Originally placed into syndication on September 3, 1973, the series was picked up by the Mutual Broadcasting System in December of that year. The original format featured five-part dramas broadcast Monday through Friday with the story coming to a conclusion on Friday. Including commercials, each part was approximately 30 minutes long. Mutual affiliates could broadcast the series in any time slot that they wished.
In 1974, still airing five days a week, the program changed to a full story in a single 30-minute installment with the same actor starring throughout the week in all five programs. That format was employed from late April 1974 to the end of the series on July 26, 1974. 
Producer J.M. Kholos was a Los Angeles advertising man who acquired the rights to suspense novels, including Tony Hillerman's "The Blessing Way", for radio adaptations. In some cases, the titles were changed. For example, the five-part "Desperate Witness" was an adaptation of "The Big Clock" by Kenneth Fearing. To create a strong package, Kholos followed through by lining up top actors, including John Astin, Edgar Bergen, Joseph Campanella, Richard Crenna, John Dehner, Howard Duff, Keenan Wynn, Richard Deacon, Patty Duke, Nina Foch, George Maharis, Susan Oliver, Brock Peters and Lurene Tuttle.
The opening theme music was by Ferrante & Teicher. Don Hills produced the series for StudioHouse, which also produced the Salvation Army's "Heartbeat Theatre". Counting each five-part show as five episodes, there were a total of 130 episodes. It failed to find a large audience due to the initial weekly serial format and the lack of promotion. According to director Elliott Lewis, "They wanted as much name value as possible to help with sales. They forgot they had to sell it. Everybody sat in the office and waited for someone to call them up and buy the show." 
Highbridge Audio released some of the five-part stories on audiocassettes.

David Barnes (boxer)

David Barnes is a British professional boxer from Manchester in England who competes in the light welterweight division. He is the former holder of both the British light welterweight and welterweight titles.
Early career.
Barnes made his professional debut in July 2001 when at the Manchester Velodrome he stopped Trevor Smith in the 2nd round of their 4 round match. After compiling an undefeated ledger of 12-0 he was just two years later in July 2003 given the opportunity to fight for the vacant British Welterweight title against the experienced Jimmy Vincent. Barnes claimed victory with a narrow score of 115-114 from the referee John Keane in what was described by commentators as ""an excellent match from start to finish"". Barnes early career suffered a hiccup when the boxer was forced to spend six weeks at an army detention centre in Colchester. Unknown to his promoters and after seven straight victories on Sky the boxer had been absent without official leave from the army for a total of 18 months until a passport check by promoter Frank Warren revealed he had deserted from the army. Speaking of the experience to the Daily Telegraph in January 2003 Barnes said "I hated nearly every minute" having joined up as a restless 15 year old.
British Welterweight Champion.
Now the full British champion and still relatively inexperienced with a record of 13-0 Barnes set about defending his title and trying to claim the Lonsdale belt outright. He re-entered the ring in December 2003 to defend for the first time against Scotsman Kevin McIntyre at the MEN Arena in Manchester winning when the fight was stopped after the 8th round. He followed up the win with further defences against Northern Ireland's Glenn McClarnon and England's James Hare which gave him the Lonsdale belt for keeps.
Losing Ground.
Barnes kept busy after the win over Hare with a victory over future European title challenger Juho Tolppola from Finland before meeting the Glossop based Namibian Ali Nuumbembe for the WBO Inter-continental welterweight title. The fight was very close and ended up with the match being declared a draw. 
In June 2005 Barnes fought Ghana's Commonwealth champion Joshua Okine, where he was put down in the 5th round and stopped in the 12th. It was his first career defeat. In choosing to fight Okine, Barnes had not allowed himself enough time to defend his British title and so had to give it up.
British Light Welterweight champion.
Barnes fought five times over the next two years competing against a host of journeymen. In March 2008 he was given the opportunity to fight for a championship again—the British light welterweight version. The opponent at the George Carnall Center in Davyhulme was former European champion Ted Bami and Barnes ran out a comfortable points winner becoming the first man to have held the British title at welter and light welterweight. 
In July 2008 he defended the title for the first time against former champion Barry Morrison from Scotland again winning on points over 12. Barnes was stripped of the title after he pulled out of a mandatory defence against former champion Colin Lynes. Barnes did not fight again until 4 December 2009 when he competed in the light welterweight version of the Prizefighter series and ironically was drawn to face the an he should have defended his British title against, Colin Lynes in the quarter finals. The fight over 3 rounds resulted in a split decision win for Lynes and handed Barnes only his second defeat.

Herbert 'Cowboy' Coward (born 1923, in South Carolina) is an actor who starred in the 1972 thriller "Deliverance".
Career.
Coward began acting in the Wild West amusement park "Ghost Town in the Sky" in Maggie Valley, North Carolina. Coward got the role as the murderous toothless mountain man in "Deliverance" when Burt Reynolds remembered him from working together at the park early in his career. Coward turned up for the audition looking so much like a hillbilly that director John Boorman, who had trouble finding an actor for the part, thought Reynolds had told him what to wear.
In 2007, Coward played the role of Harmon Teaster in the film adaptation of "Ghost Town". It was only his second film role and his first in 34 years. Former co-star Bill McKinney from "Deliverance" played the role of Victor Burnett.

Robert Rede

Sir Robert Rede KS (died 7 or 8 January 1519) was an English Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.
Rede was the son of William Rede of Wrangle, Lincolnshire, a Calais merchant, and his wife Joan. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1467, (although he may have previously been a member of Clement's Inn) and gave his first reading there in 1481. In 1486 he was made a Serjeant-at-law, followed by a promotion in 1494 to King's Serjeant, and an appointment in 1495 as a justice of the Court of King's Bench, where he sat for 10 years under Sir John Fineux, and was knighted for his services in 1501. He was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas in 1506 and promoted to Chief Justice, a position he held until his death.
Rede married the daughter of John Alfegh (or Alphay), a fellow member of Lincoln's Inn, and under the terms of his marriage settlement acquired lands in Hoo. Alfegh had built Bore Place in Chiddingstone, Kent, and this property later came to Rede and his wife in 1489 under the terms of Alfegh's will.
Rede died on 7 or 8 January 1519. He left a £4 annual stipend to finance three lectureships at Jesus College, Cambridge, one for logic, one for moral philosophy and one for the humanities. Although these positions had been provided since 1480, the stipend helped secure the position. From 1858 the fund was used to support a single annual lecture, known as the Rede Lecture, a practice that has continued to this day.
Marriage and issue.
In the 1470s Rede married Margaret Alfegh, daughter of John Alphegh, by whom he had two sons and five daughters:

Ashious Melu

Ashious Jordan Melu (6 June 1957 – 20 January 1997) also known as Ashios or Ashols Melu was a Zambian footballer and coach who captained the national team from 1988 to 1992 and is credited with having one of the hardest shots in Zambian football.
Playing career.
Melu was born in Chililabombwe on June 6, 1957 and attended Chililabombwe Secondary School and turned out for the Konkola Blades before moving to the Mufulira Wanderers in the late 1970s.
Melu played as a striker and was top goal scorer in the Zambian league in 1983, scoring 43 goals in all competitions with most of them scored from distance and free-kicks, and winning the Footballer of the Year award. Melu had the distinction of having the hottest shot in the league and he got called up to the national team but did not hold down a regular place.
Alongside Efford Chabala, Kalusha Bwalya, Frederick Kashimoto, Evans Katebe and the Mulala brothers, and later Charles Musonda, Jonson Bwalya and Gibby Mbasela, Melu would be part of a Wanderers team that was very successful in cup competitions in the 1980s though they never actually won the league championship.
At the beginning of the 1986 football season, a few eyebrows were raised when Melu converted into a defender for Wanderers but his performances in defence were impressive enough to earn him a call-up to the national team and he still weighed in with his share of goals from dead ball situations. Melu represented the country at the African Cup of Nations in 1986, in which Zambia was eliminated in the first round.
In 1987, Melu won his second Footballer of the Year award making it an almost clean sweep by Wanderers players with Kalusha Bwalya (1984) Jonson Bwalya (1986) and Efford Chabala missing out on the award but winning the Sportsman of the Year trophy in 1985. In 1988 Melu took over as Zambian captain when Fighton Simukonda was dropped after the President’s Cup tournament in June in South Korea. Later in the year, Melu led the team to the Seoul Olympic games, in which Zambia became the first African country to reach the quarter finals, disposing of Italy and Guatemala along the way with 4-0 scorelines, losing to West Germany by the same margin.
Already past his 30th birthday, Melu surprised a lot of fans when he signed for Greek club Olympiakos on a three year contract. Melu later played for an Austrian club for a year before returning to feature for Zambia at Africa Cup of Nations in 1992 which proved to be his last outing for Zambia due to stiff competition from Samuel Chomba and Robert Watiyakeni. As a result, Melu was not part of the team that perished in the Gabon disaster the following.
Coaching career.
Melu turned to coaching and was first appointed assistant coach at the Wanderers in 1992 before taking over as head coach. In the interim, he attended a coaching course in Germany.
In 1994, he was named Zambia national team assistant coach to Roald Poulsen. He then led the Wanderers to back to back league championships in 1995 and 1996 achieving what he did not as a player and netting the Wanderers their first league success since 1978.
Before the beginning of the 1997 season with the Wanderers, Melu fell ill and died in early 1997.

British Kenya

Kenya, formally the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, was part of the British Empire in the territory of present-day Kenya. It was established when the former East Africa Protectorate was transformed into a British crown colony in 1920. Technically, "Colony of Kenya" referred to the interior lands. A ten-mile coastal strip, ostensibly on lease from the Sultan of Zanzibar, was the "Protectorate of Kenya", and was only ceded to the Colony of Kenya in October 1963. However, the two were controlled as a single administrative unit. Mombasa, the largest city in 1921, had a population of 32,000 at that time.
Indians in the Kenya Colony objected to the reservation of the Highlands for Europeans, and bitterness grew between the Indians and the Europeans. The population in 1921 was estimated at 2,376,000, of whom 9651 were Europeans, 22,822 Indians, and 10,102 Arabs. 
The colony came to an end in 1963 when independence was agreed with the British. After independence, the former colony became known as Kenya.

Cleversafe

Cleversafe Incorporated is a privately held company based in the United States. Cleversafe sells an object storage system, which it calls the Dispersed Storage® Network or dsNet. The Cleversafe dsNet is used for both private clouds and public clouds, for a range of storage applications including backup, business continuity, archiving, file sharing and cloud storage. Cleversafe’s target markets include Media and Entertainment, Financial Services, Storage as a Service, Advertising/Marketing/Corporate Communications, Federal Government, Photo sharing services, and Telecommunications.
History.
Cleversafe 
Cleversafe was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 2004 by S. Christopher Gladwin and was originally based in IIT's technology incubator. Mr. Gladwin served as CEO from 2004 to 2013 when John Morris joined Cleversafe as President and CEO.
Products & Technology.
The primary technical characteristics of the Cleversafe dsNet are as follows.
The Cleversafe Dispersed Storage Network consists of a combination of appliances of three types. The Slicestor appliances in a dsNet store fragments of data created from objects by applying erasure coding. These fragments are called slices in a dsNet. The use of erasure coding to transform objects into multiple such fragments makes the transformed data fault tolerant such that the loss of one or more fragments does not result in the loss of any data from the original object. The specific erasure coding method used by Cleversafe is Cauchy-Reed-Solomon.
This erasure coding function is performed by Accesser appliances, which receive object data and transform that data into a number of slices when object data is stored to the dsNet. When applications read objects from the dsNet, the Accessers retrieve the associated slices from multiple Slicestor appliances and recreate the original object data, returning it to the requesting application client.
The third type of appliance used to create a dsNet is the dsNet Manager which is used to configure, administer, operate, and monitor the dsNet.
The dsNet Manager, Accessers, and Slicestors are connected to one another and to the application clients that will read and write data to the dsNet using Ethernet. All of the appliances in a dsNet may be in the same location connected via a LAN or geographically distributed across multiple locations using a WAN between those locations.
To date Cleversafe has been awarded over 100 patents.

<doc id="19605624" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19605624" title="Sakura Kinomoto">
Sakura Kinomoto

Creation and conception.
Sakura's character design for the manga was originally developed by Mokona of Clamp. She was designed to capture the image of Mokona's then two-year-old niece Kawaji. The original character's facial expression changed considerably until the manga started. Her many magical costumes were introduced as CLAMP felt it was "sad" for a girl to wear the same magical costume all the time.
Picking a Japanese actress to voice Sakura was difficult. Neither Clamp writer Nanase Ohkawa or anime director Morio Asaka were satisfied with any of the voice actress who auditioned for the role. In the end, Sakura Tange was selected for the role with sound director Masafumi Mima believing her to fit the character thanks to her quiet and strong voice.
In Nelvana's English adaptation titled ""Cardcaptors"", Sakura was originally going to be called "Nikki," but they later decided to keep her first original given name because of the reception of the "Cardcaptors" adaptation plus the difficulty and expense of editing out numerous appearances of her name in "rōmaji" in the Anime series. However, her family name was changed to "Avalon". Her first name is also pronounced differently from the original Japanese. An alternative English dub produced by Omni Productions that aired on Animax Asia, her original full name was entirely kept the way it was in the original Japanese version.
Character.
Sakura is a ten-year-old girl who lives in the town of Tomoeda in Japan, where she attends Tomoeda Elementary School. An extremely energetic and cheerful girl, she is very athletic, being a member of her school's cheerleading squad and excellent at track-and-field activities. She lives with her father and older brother. Her mother died when she was three years old. She has a close relationship with her father, whom she adores. She never fails to greet her mother's picture in the mornings. She often fights with her brother, who teases her, but she truly cares about him. Sakura's smile is undefeatable and is what draws people to her.
Sakura's optimistic and trustworthy character allows her to be friendly with everybody, and the entire series focuses on the friendships she creates with people, whether strangers, loose acquaintances, or rivals. Her personality is a dominating factor in her relationships, especially with Tomoyo.
One of Sakura's most notable traits is her "invincible spell", , which has carried her through innumerable trials and obstacles as she masters her magical skills. While she often comes across as naïve, clumsy, and clueless, Sakura is known for her occasional moments of insight and sensitivity towards the feelings of others. Sakura is so innocent and naive that she fails to recognize Syaoran's feelings for her and unintentionally gets into trouble. Despite this, she retains a determined spirit and attachments to those she cares for.
Magic.
Sakura's most sacred and important items are most likely her sealing wand and cards, since they are her main weapons in magic. Throughout the series, Sakura's magical powers get progressively stronger. This is mostly verified by Cerberus at random points in the series, as Sakura would otherwise appear to have equal expertise in each capture, when she summons Clow Cards. Throughout the Clow Card arc, Cerberus's comments seem to imply that Sakura's magic grows as she battles and captures more Cards. This is also implied in the corresponding anime. In contrast of this, in the second half of the series we are reminded of Sakura’s inexperience as she often collapses after transforming the cards. However, as she grows progressively proficient in changing Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, she becomes less tired and more aware of Clow Reed's presence. She also remembers more details about her prophetic dreams. During the last of Eriol's trials, she is able to transform several cards at once. This sequence of events during the second arc is more or less true in the anime version of the series as well, with only a few changes made. The most obvious of these is that Yue (a character who, in the original version of the series is shown as becoming much closer to Sakura throughout Eriol’s trials to the point of accepting her at least as a valued friend) is shown throwing her a constant stream of criticism as a reminder of Sakura’s lack of experience. Another interesting change made in the anime variation is that, by end of the series, she subconsciously manages to create a new Card, the nameless card (which later becomes the Hope Card), which would later serve as a major plot point for the second movie.
After the Final Judgement, Clow Reed tells her that her magic is not drawn from the sun nor from the moon, but from her own star, which may start small, but is ever-shining with its own brilliant light. However, like Clow Reed's magic, Sakura's is a balance of sun and moon magic. Eriol gave half of his powers to Sakura's father, the other half of Clow's incarnation. This made Sakura the most powerful magician in the world, even surpassing her predecessor Clow Reed.
Relationships.
Sakura is well-known and loved by everyone for her ability to befriend others, including rivals and strangers. Among those she is close to, the series focuses on Sakura's best friendships and love interests.
Relationship with Syaoran Li.
Sakura's relationship with Syaoran is the most recognized in the series, due to Syaoran's change of behavior towards Sakura from rivalry to friendly and romantic. When they first met, Syaoran disliked Sakura and saw her as a rival over the Clow Cards. Despite how he treated her, Sakura never gave back any response towards him. Their relationship remained rocky for a short time due to their mutual goal to collect the cards, but as they spent time together and aided each other, a friendship began to emerge. While Syaoran's feelings quickly developed into romantic, Sakura remained naive and simply thought of him as a close friend. After she is rejected by Yukito and is comforted by Syaoran, Sakura slowly realized about his feelings. When Syaoran finally confesses, Sakura is confused of the situation. However, after learning about his departure, she realizes that she indeed loves him, and promises to Syaoran that she will stay with him forever.
Relationship with Yukito Tsukihiro.
Yukito is Sakura's first crush. He is 7 years older than her, but it never bothers her. Due to him being her brother's best friend, she tries to get him to come over to her house and goes to school with her brother to see Yukito every morning. She makes snacks for him and tries to spend as much time with him as she can. Even when she discovers that he is in fact Yue, her feelings don't change. She eventually confesses to him, only to be gently rejected and she realizes that she loves him the same way as she does for her father. Although heartbroken, she learns to accept that he loves her brother and maintains a deep friendship with Yukito.
Friendship with Tomoyo Daidouji.
Tomoyo is Sakura's best friend and second cousin on their mothers' side. They first met in the third grade, and since then, Tomoyo has adored and worshipped Sakura. They are as close as sisters. Tomoyo tends to exaggerate over Sakura's cuteness; she designs several colourful clothes for Sakura and videotapes her everyday routine. Sakura is a bit bemused by Tomoyo's devotion towards her, but nevertheless loves her. There are hints that Tomoyo has feelings for Sakura beyond typical romantic friendship, but doesn't make them known because of her involvement in pairing Sakura up with Yukito.
Appearances in other media.
In the first "Cardcaptor Sakura" film, Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong, where she meets Syaoran's family and encounters the spirit of a woman angry at Clow Reed who mistakenly calls Sakura to her because of her being the holder of the Clow Cards. In "", she learns that there is a 53rd card, the Sealed card which was created to balance the positive energy of the other cards.
Sakura is a playable character in eight of the "Cardcaptor Sakura" video games, and her character design is featured in the series' version of Tetris. The character design of "Sakura Kinomoto" is reused in the Clamp series ', which presents an alternate world story that also uses characters from many of the group's previous series. In "Tsubasa" the design is used for several characters named Sakura, including the central character named "(Sakura-hime)". Sakura also plays an important role during the last arc of ', in a dream to a reincarnated Princess Sakura. During this vision, Sakura gives her older self the Star Wand and assures her that "everything will be all right". She seems several years older than her final appearance in the manga, but is wearing a similar uniform to that of her old elementary one. The wand is later seen in Yuuko Ichihara's shop.
Sakura also appeared in the OVA "Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations" as a spirit or vision that Princess Sakura sees, which guides her back to where see came from, the Tocho (government building) when she gets lost. She disappears when Princess Sakura sees the building. 
In the short anime film "Shiritsu Horitsuba Gakuen Bangai-hen: Tenkōsei ni Dokkidoki" Sakura appears as a student from the anime's titular school and the younger cousin from "Tsubasa"s Sakura.
Reception.
In both 1999 and 2000 Sakura won the Animage Grand Prix for "Best Female Character". In 2001 Sakura Kinomoto won the "Cutest Anime Girl of the Year" award from All Anime World. In a "Newtype" poll from March 2010, Sakura was voted as the fourth "Most Popular Female Anime Character" from the 1990s. She also won the Anime Saimoe Tournament 2002, an online popularity contest for the "Most Moe Anime Character of the Year".

East Asia

East Asia or Eastern Asia (the latter form preferred solely by the United Nations) is a subregion of Asia that can be defined in either geographical or cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about 15% bigger than the area of Europe.
More than 1.5 billion people, about 38% of the population of Asia and 22% or over one fifth of all the people in the world, live in East Asia. The region is one of the world's most populated places, with a population density of , being about three times the world average of , although Mongolia has the lowest population density of a sovereign state. Using the UN subregion definitions, East Asia ranks second in population only to Southern Asia.
Historically, many societies in East Asia have been part of the Chinese cultural sphere, and East Asian vocabulary and scripts are often derived from Classical Chinese and Chinese script. Sometimes Northeast Asia is used to denote Japan and Korea. Major religions include Buddhism (mostly Mahayana), Confucianism or Neo-Confucianism, Taoism, Chinese folk religion in China, Shinto in Japan, Shamanism in Korea, Mongolia and other indigenous populations of northern East Asia, and recently Christianity in South Korea. The Chinese Calendar is the root from which many other East Asian calendars are derived.
History.
The history of East Asia is predominantly the history of the Chinese Dynasties that dominated the region in matters of trade as well as militarily, such as the Qin and the Han Dynasties. There are records of tributes sent overseas from the early kingdoms of Korea and Japan. There were also considerable levels of cultural and religious exchange between the Chinese and other regional Dynasties and Kingdoms.
As connections began to strengthen with the Western world, China's power began to diminish. Around the same time, Japan solidified itself as a nation state. Through WWII, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan and Eastern China fell under Japanese control. Following Japan's defeat in the war, the Korean peninsula became independent, while Taiwan was returned to the Republic of China.
Uses of the term East Asia.
[[File:Location-Asia-UNsubregions.png|thumb|225px|Regions of Asia as defined by the UN (except for Northern Asia):
]]
The UN subregion of Eastern Asia and other common definitions of East Asia contain the entirety of the People's Republic of China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia and Taiwan.
Culturally, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam are commonly seen as being encompassed by cultural East Asia.
Alternative definitions.
There are mixed debates around the world whether these countries or regions should be considered in East Asia or not.
In business and economics, "East Asia" has been used to refer to a wide geographical area covering ten countries in ASEAN, People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. However, in this context, the term "Far East" is often more appropriate which covers ASEAN countries and the traditional countries in East Asia. Far East describes the region's geographical position in relation to Europe rather than its location within Asia. Alternatively, the term "Asia Pacific Region" is often used in describing the Far East region as well as Oceania.
In contrast to the United Nations definition, East Asia commonly is used to refer to the eastern part of Asia, as the term implies. Observers preferring a broader definition of 'East Asia' often use the term Northeast Asia to refer to the greater China area, the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, and Japan, with Southeast Asia covering the ten ASEAN countries. This usage, which is increasingly widespread in economic and diplomatic discussion, is at odds with the historical meanings of both "East Asia" and "Northeast Asia". The Council on Foreign Relations defines Northeast Asia as Japan and Korea.
Culture.
The culture of East Asia has been influenced by the civilization of northern China. East Asia shares a Confucian ethical philosophy, Buddhism, political and legal structures, and historically a common writing system. The relationship between Northern China and East Asia has been compared to the historical influence of Greco-Roman civilization on Europe.

BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII

The BL 4-inch gun Mk VII was a British high-velocity naval gun introduced in 1908 as an anti-torpedo boat gun in large ships, and in the main armament of smaller ships. It was also used as a defensive weapon on Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships (DEMS) during the Second World War.
Naval history.
The guns armed the following warships :
The gun was succeeded in the "heavy" 4-inch class on new warships commissioned from 1914 onwards by the QF 4 inch Mk V. This new generation of warships were more heavily armed, and the BL Mk VII's role as secondary armament on capital ships and primary armament on cruisers was taken over by the BL 6 inch Mk VII and BL 6 inch Mk XII while the 4-inch calibre became the secondary armament on cruisers and primary armament on destroyers.
In World War II many guns were used to arm merchant ships.
World War I field gun service.
A battery of 4 guns mounted on field carriages was first deployed with the South African Heavy Artillery in the German South West Africa campaign in 1915 and returned to England in September. They were then deployed in the East African Campaign from February 1916 with 11th Heavy Battery (renumbered 15th Battery from April 1916) manned by the Royal Marine Artillery.

Ada Nield Chew

Ada Nield Chew (28 January 1870 - 27 December 1945) was a British suffragist.
Ada Nield was born on a farm near Butt Lane in North Staffordshire on 28 January 1870, daughter of Willam and Jane (née Hammond) Nield. She left school at the age of eleven to help her mother take care of house and family. When she was in her twenties she worked as a tailor in a factory in Crewe, Cheshire, but was dismissed after writing a series of letters to "The Crewe Chronicle" which criticised working conditions in the factory. Following this she became active in the Independent Labour Party and in 1896, she toured the north-east of England in the Clarion Van to publicise the ILP's policies. Shortly afterwards, in 1897 she married George Chew another ILP organiser. Their daughter, Doris, (and only child) was born in the following year. Chew then became an organiser for the Women's Trade Union League.
In the years leading up to the First World War, Chew became an active supporter of the movement for women's suffrage. According to her daughter, Chew as a working class woman, sometimes felt patronised by the middle class leadership of the movement. This was reflected in a lively correspondence with Christabel Pankhurst in the pages of "The Clarion" during 1904. Chew became a member of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and worked for this body as an organiser from 1911 to 1914. The main focus of her work was in winning support for the cause through contacts in the labour movement.
During the First World War Chew adopted a pacifist stance and was active in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and other anti-war organisations.
After the end of the war Chew withdrew from any major involvement in politics, preferring instead to concentrate on building up the mail-order drapery business which she founded. She retired from the business in 1930 and undertook a round-the-world tour in 1935. Her husband died in 1940, and Chew herself died on 27 December 1945 at, Burnley, Lancashire. She is buried in Rochdale. She was survived by her daughter, Doris, who later edited a selection of her writings together with a brief biography.
Archives.
An oral history interview between Brian Harrison and Doris Nield Chew, about her mother, Ada, is held at The Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics, ref 8SUF/B/037. 
It is one of over 200 interviews made in the 1970s as part of 'Oral Evidence on the Suffragette and Suffragist Movements: the Brian Harrison interviews'.

Helicodonta obvoluta

Helicodonta obvoluta is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicodontidae.
The distribution of this species is spread over large parts of Europe, where it inhabits deciduous and mixed forests.
This species is sometimes called the "cheese snail" because the shape of the shell resembles that of a wheel of cheese.
Description.
Shells of juveniles and young adults of this snail are typically covered with hairs 1mm in length. The hair may be absent in older specimens. The dark-brown shell is characterized by a flat upper side with a very slightly sunken spire and a wide umbilicus. The peristome is flattened above and below. The white everted lip is slightly thickened centrally to form a callus in the palatal and parietal region, therefore the mouth seems to be separated into three embayments in some specimens. The shell diameter ranges from 10-15mm; the shell height from 5-7mm. The weight of the adult living snail is about 414.2±6.7 mg. In contrast to many other snail species within the superfamily Helicoidea, this species has no love darts.
Life cycle.
The average life span of "Helicodonta obvoluta" is 2 years, with a maximum of 3 years. The activity period stretches from April to November; daily activity is concentrated in the early morning and at night time. Mating can last for 2–3 hours. There are two periods of reproduction, the first one in spring (April–June), the second in autumn (August–October). 
The eggs are laid in clusters of 9-27 per clutch in rotten wood and are covered with a mucus layer for protection. Juveniles hatch after 14–31 days of incubation time, and reach maturity after 140–624 days. The spring generation may reach maturity in the same year, while the autumn generation has to overwinter as immature snails. "Helicodonta obvoluta" spends most of its lifespan near and in fallen tree trunks, which provide places for egg-laying, feeding, shelter in daytime and hibernation sites in winter. In the case of populations that live in milder, oceanic climates such as Great Britain, snails can also hibernate within leaf litter.
Distribution.
The main distribution zone of this species extends from north western Spain across France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, southern and central Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. There are also isolated populations in southeastern England and northern Germany, which may be remnants of an earlier, more extensive, distribution range. The distribution in Albania, Macedonia and Greece is unclear, as the populations there belong to "Helicodonta albanica", which is assigned as separate species by many authors, while others treat it as subspecies of "Helicodonta obvoluta".

Okhla Sanctuary

Okhla Bird Sanctuary is a bird sanctuary at the Okhla barrage over Yamuna River. It is situated in Noida, Gautam Buddh Nagar district, on Delhi-Uttar Pradesh state border and known as a haven for over 300 bird species, especially waterbirds. In 1990, an area of on the river Yamuna was notified as a bird sanctuary by the Government of Uttar Pradesh under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The site is located at the point where the river enters Uttar Pradesh. The most prominent feature of the sanctuary is the large lake created by damming the river, which lies sandwiched between Okhla village towards the west and Gautam Budh Nagar towards the east.
History.
The areas around Okhla barrage, encompassing the river Yamuna and the marshes associated with it, have been a favorite haunt for birdwatchers, ever since the construction of Agra Canal, which starts from here in 1874. Major-General H. P. W. Hutson recorded the birds of Okhla during the course of his ornithological surveys in the Delhi region during June 1943 to May 1945. Subsequently, Mrs Usha Ganguli also recorded the avifauna from this site in her book, A guide to the birds of the Delhi area. Following the construction of a barrage and the resulting lake in 1986, birdwatching activity has increased at this site.
Spread over on the river Yamuna, the sanctuary is in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh. It was declared a protected area in 1990, under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
Over the years, due to increasing pollution in the Yamuna, and shrinking habitat of marshlands and water areas, the bird count has reduced. The habitat of the sanctuary has been under threat due to rapid urban development and construction activities in the surrounding areas. On August 14, 2013, responding to a petition filed by local environmentalist, National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the Noida authority to stop unauthorised constructions by private builders within a 10-km radius of the sanctuary. It also asked the authority to conduct fresh land-survey in the area.
Attractions.
A total of 302 species have confirmed records from Okhla bird sanctuary and the areas in its immediate vicinity. An additional 27 species have been listed by Harris (2001) as probable, but unconfirmed, occurrence. In January 2011, as a part of Asian Waterbird Census 2011, a leucistic Coot, known for its unusual bright white plumage, was been spotted with the flock of Common Coots, for the first time in India.
The total Okhla list includes: 
Transport.
The sanctuary is approachable from Mathura Road (NH-2), via Sarita Vihar going towards Noida. The nearest stations of Delhi Metro are Sarita Vihar and Jasola Apollo metro station .

Baltimore Pike (SEPTA Route 102 station)

Baltimore Pike is a station on the SEPTA Route 102 (Sharon Hill) trolley in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania. It is officially located near Baltimore Pike & Odgen Street, however the shed is located on the opposite side of this intersection between Glenwood and Bridge Avenues.
Trolleys arriving at this station travel between 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania. The station has a shed with a roof where people can go inside when it is raining. Baltimore Pike is a major stop, not only because it's a commercial strip with a SEPTA bus connection, but because the street itself is also a former state highway that connects U.S. 1 and U.S. 13.

Leonard Hofstadter

Leonard Leakey Hofstadter, Ph.D., is a fictional character on the CBS television series "The Big Bang Theory", portrayed by actor Johnny Galecki. Leonard is an experimental physicist, who shares an apartment with colleague and best friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons). For his portrayal, Galecki was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award in 2011.
Leonard has been described as the straight man of the series. Penny (Kaley Cuoco) is Leonard's next-door neighbor and main love interest, and the teasing of romance between the two of them is a major force driving the series.
Creation and casting.
Leonard is named after actor/producer Sheldon Leonard, and Nobel Prize Laureate Robert Hofstadter.
Johnny Galecki was originally asked to play the role of Sheldon Cooper, but Galecki thought he would be "better suited" for the character of Leonard.
Personality.
Originally from New Jersey and a graduate of Princeton University, Leonard works as a Caltech experimental physicist, mainly working with lasers, and shares an apartment with colleague Sheldon Cooper in Pasadena, California. He is usually seen wearing his characteristic black thick-framed glasses, low-cut black Converse All Stars sneakers, neutral-colored sweat jackets, brown trousers, and physics-themed t-shirts. Penny tried to change his outfits, but to no avail. After dating Priya, he switches to shirts, waistcoats and dark, cloth trousers. After she leaves for India, he switches back to his original outfits, but replaces his brown trousers with jeans.
Although Leonard feels at home with his geek colleagues, he wants to be more social. Among the main characters, he generally has the least amount of difficulty interacting with "non-geek" individuals. He is instantly captivated by Penny, and from the beginning sets out to date her.
In early episodes, Leonard is reluctant to let Penny know about his recreational activities (such as "Klingon" Boggle), as he does not want her to see him as a geek. While certainly a geek by most definitions, he is less socially inept than Sheldon (who is unable to grasp social norms and is often even dismissive of them), Raj (who was unable to talk to women unless he was under the influence of alcohol or anti-anxiety prescription drugs), and Howard (who was often seen as "creepy" when flirting with women, including Penny).
Leonard can also play the cello, although he holds the bow upside down and plays on the finger board. As seen in the season 1 episode "The Hamburger Postulate", he and Leslie Winkle practice their instruments and then leave to have intercourse (which Leonard calls "... a little musical foreplay!")
Despite his attempts to not appear to be a geek, Leonard owns, among other things, "Star Wars" hygiene products, a prop of the One Ring, an expansive Superman comic book collection (and wears Clark Kent-type glasses) and a "Battlestar Galactica" Colonial warrior's flight suit. Early in the series, Leonard tried to get rid of his collectables to impress Penny with his maturity. However, he changed his mind when he saw that Penny was already dating another man.
Because he has lived with Sheldon for many years, Leonard knows him better than his other colleagues. "The Staircase Implementation" features a flashback to when Leonard first moved in with Sheldon. Leonard explains to Penny that he moved in despite the difficulty of living with Sheldon because the rent was so reasonable. Shortly after moving in, during a rocketry experiment Leonard, Raj and Howard conducted, Sheldon observed miscalculations Leonard made in mixing the rocket fuel and managed to avert disaster by grabbing the fuel and placing it in their apartment building's elevator. The resulting explosion disabled the elevator, thus explaining why the elevator is out of order for the duration of the series. Leonard explains that Sheldon, despite his tendency to alienate others, kept quiet about Leonard's destruction of the elevator. (Leonard cites: "He didn't rat me to the building manager, or the police... or Homeland Security."
Leonard often finds himself explaining Sheldon's behavior or serving as a mediator between him and other people in many situations. For instance, when Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Leonard gave Penny Sheldon's mother's phone number so she would call her son and scold him for his behavior, thus ending the fight.
Leonard's primary health concern is his lactose intolerance, breaking wind if he eats any dairy products. According to the (unaired) pilot, he cannot process corn either. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of myopia, and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when his glasses were broken at the movie theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup glasses. In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate through the living room by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers from sleep apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.
At various points in the show, Sheldon also says that Leonard gets carsick unless he sits in the front seat. In season four, it was revealed that Leonard has asthma as well, and also has to use the inhaler after intercourse.
Family.
All of the members of Leonard's family are accomplished scientists, except for his younger brother Michael, who is a tenured law professor at Harvard University.
Leonard's mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist. She has a personality almost identical to Sheldon's, including strict speech patterns, lack of social conventions, and attention to detail, and she is principally responsible for Leonard's difficult childhood. Sheldon and Beverly have a friendly relationship where they share details of each other's lives. Leonard is upset with that fact that she tells Sheldon more than she tells him. After a night out of bonding and drinking with Penny, Beverly kisses Sheldon, but realizes there are no romantic feelings involved.
Due to his mother's views, Leonard never celebrated his birthday when he was a child, and when she visited him she was not impressed with his unoriginal research. Leonard revealed to Penny that he built a "hugging machine" when he was young in order to compensate for the lack of affection from his mother. He further stated that his father used to borrow it. Beverly also belittles Leonard by pointing out that his brother and sister are more successful in their respective fields than he is. Leonard's brother, Michael, is a Harvard law professor and is engaged to the youngest appellate court judge in New Jersey history, and his older sister is a cutting-edge medical researcher working with gibbons to cure diabetes. Leonard also dislikes Christmas because instead of gifts the Hofstadter kids had to turn in papers to "Santa" which were graded the next day and in the course of six years he never got over a "C minus", which in Sheldon's view was a true gift, because, by Sheldon's thoughts, he never deserved over it. Leonard had a childhood pet, a cat named Dr. Boots Hofstadter.
Leonard's father is briefly mentioned as an anthropologist. Sheldon reveals that Leonard's middle name, "Leakey", comes from famed archaeologist Louis Leakey, with whom Leonard's father had worked. Leonard is embarrassed by his middle name and its humorous connotations, and rarely mentions it, as the name is an obvious bum. Apparently his father was not very affectionate towards him either, when he mentions that he had to compete with the bones of an Etruscan kid for his father's favor.
Though little is known about Leonard's extended family, a few references to it have been made. In the first episode, Sheldon and Leonard discuss Leonard's grandmother, who had visited them on Thanksgiving the year before. She has Alzheimer's disease and apparently "had an episode" during her visit, which resulted in her stripping off her clothes and carving the turkey. On Beverly's first visit, she tells Leonard that his uncle Floyd has died, which greatly upsets him (according to him, Floyd was the only family member he really liked). Leonard also has several other uncles, which Sheldon says are all very bald, and when they gather together, they look "like a half carton of eggs." Leonard describes his aunt, however, as being "one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet".
Work.
Leonard has an IQ of 173, and was 24 years old when he received his PhD from Princeton University. Leonard also received a dissertation of the year award for his doctoral paper on experimental particle physics.
Leonard has been established to have been a child prodigy, and a gifted scientist with an impressive knowledge of theoretical physics. His work as an experimental physicist often includes the use of lasers, such as a helium-neon laser or free-electron laser, and his research topics have varied from Bose-Einstein condensates and foundations of quantum mechanics to soft cosmic rays at sea level and development of novel rocket propellants. Leonard designs experiments in order to prove theories but, according to the cynical and childish egotistical theorist Sheldon, his work is mostly derivative and thus unimportant.
Although Leonard's attempts to disprove the existence of dark matter were made moot by the work of another physicist, Leonard helped to solidify proof of the hypothetical matter's existence with a photomultiplier, and was invited as keynote speaker to a topical conference by the Institute of Experimental Physics for his successful research on super solids.
From the season 6 finale, The Bon Voyage Reaction" Leonard heads to the United Kingdom to work on a physics project searching the hydrodynamics equivalent of the Unruh effect, sponsored by Professor Stephen Hawking, for three months on a ship in the North Sea.
Relationships.
Leonard became interested Penny within a short time of meeting her. His infatuation with Penny becomes the major force that drives the series during the first seasons. By the end of the first season, Leonard finally managed to ask Penny out, and they had their first date. Subsequently, they broke up because Penny felt she was not as smart as Leonard would like.
Besides Penny, Leonard has been involved with only a few other women. One of Leonard's former girlfriends that is mentioned in several occasions is Joyce Kim, who did not appear until the third season. Leonard's friends recalled on many occasions that they were together for only 27 days, after which Joyce, later revealed to be a spy, defected to North Korea.
Initially, after feeling that Penny was not for him, Leonard turned his attention to fellow scientist Leslie Winkle. The first time Leonard asked Leslie out, she rejected him, and his further relationships with her proved to be only short-lived casual sex encounters that only happened to satisfy Leslie's libido. Leslie briefly started dating Leonard during Season 2, but when he failed to back her up in an argument with Sheldon, she dumped him.
In the second season, Leonard began a stable relationship with doctor Stephanie Barnett. Although the relationship went well, even earning Sheldon's approval, Leonard felt uncomfortable with Stephanie moving in with him, and the relationship ended.
On another occasion, when Leonard's mother was visiting, he and Penny came very close to having intercourse, but Leonard ruined the moment by suggesting that they were burying their lifelong issues with their parents by doing so, which offended Penny. In the second season finale, when Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, and Raj were due to leave for a three-month scientific expedition to the North Pole, Penny privately expressed sadness, and wish that he would not leave.
In the third season premiere, Leonard and Penny finally started a romantic relationship and had intercourse for the first time. However, the relationship ended after eight months, after Leonard told Penny he loved her and took umbrage at her inability to reciprocate, which led to friction that was exploited by guest star Wil Wheaton who appeared as a fictionalized version of himself, who observed and exacerbated it in order to break them up in the middle of a bowling match Wheaton's team was having against Leonard, Penny, Sheldon.
Shortly after his breakup with Penny, in "The Plimpton Stimulation", Leonard has a one-night stand with Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton (Judy Greer), a physicist he admires, when Sheldon invited her to stay in their apartment for a brief visit. This encounter causes some tension between Leonard and Penny, who is somewhat judgmental of Leonard's doing so. However, the two later resolve their feelings and their friendship continues.
In the third season finale, "The Lunar Excitation", after Penny's failed attempts to move on from her relationship with Leonard, she becomes intoxicated and has sex with him. In the morning, Leonard believes that their relationship has resumed, though Penny tells him that the previous night was a mistake. This causes a strain on their friendship; at the end of the episode, Leonard becomes intoxicated and tries to have intercourse with her, prompting Penny to push him out of her apartment, to which Leonard suspects a double standard. He immediately makes the same advances towards Leslie Winkle, who replies 'Let me think about it" and slams the door in his face.
Leonard also has an affair with Raj's younger sister Priya (apparently every time she comes to town), despite a pinky swear with Howard that neither of them would attempt to make a move on her, and Raj giving his strong disapproval.
Throughout the fourth season, it becomes obvious that Penny is still in love with Leonard. It is unclear whether or not Leonard has noticed this, though he clearly is still interested in Penny. In "The Benefactor Factor", a woman propositions Leonard in exchange for a large donation to the physics department; he initially resists and she admits that she planned to make the donation anyway, after which they engage in a one-night stand. Leonard arrives home the next morning, whereupon Penny recognizes his "walk of shame" and Sheldon thinks Leonard has a future in becoming a gigolo to rich ladies in exchange for donations.
When Priya returns, she and Leonard begin a relationship. Raj strongly opposes this, and Penny is secretly uncomfortable with Leonard dating someone else, eventually breaking down and crying while talking with her friend Amy Farrah Fowler. Once again, Leonard is unaware of Penny's true feelings. Subsequently, Priya pressures Leonard into ending his friendship with Penny, which he does, albeit extremely reluctantly. Penny complies, though it is clear that she does not want Leonard out of her life. Penny eventually resolves to stay in Leonard's life by ingratiating herself to Priya.
In the Season 4 finale, Leonard runs into Penny and Raj as they come out of his room in the morning, just after Leonard and Priya appear to break up upon Leonard's learning that Priya is soon moving back to India. At the start of Season 5, Leonard and Priya are trying to maintain a long-distance relationship via Skype (including a failed attempt at cybersex) with Priya continuing to treat Leonard like a submissive partner. Despite being the most eager to have sex, Leonard proves here he is quite awkward in these situations. Leonard later goes to a wedding with Amy, and they seem to take a liking to each other, though Sheldon disapproves, karate-chopping Leonard and saying, "She's not for you...not for you!". Later, despite feeling that he and Priya were in love and might get married, Leonard finds himself attracted to a comic book artist named Alice. The attraction is mutual, and they even share a kiss. Right when they are about to have sex, however, he tells Alice that he has a girlfriend, thus ending the relationship. Leonard then decides to confess his behavior to Priya via Skype, but he is shocked to learn that Priya has also betrayed him, sleeping with her former boyfriend; Priya defends that they both slipped up a little, but Leonard corrects her saying that he slipped a little, while she slipped a lot, bringing the conversation to a strained end. In the next episode, Leonard tells Sheldon that he is single, implying that he and Priya have broken up; his actions since then have confirmed their split occurred.
Penny is still single and dating, though when intoxicated, has confessed that she regrets breaking up with Leonard. In "The Ornithophobia Diffusion", Leonard and Penny go to the movies as friends. Leonard decides that since they are no longer dating, he can be honest and does not have to pay for everything or do whatever Penny wants. The two bicker all evening and sabotage each other's attempts to chat up people in the bar. Penny decides that she likes the new, more assertive Leonard. Leonard sees this as another opportunity to grovel and try to get Penny to sleep with him, so she leaves.
On the spur of the moment in "The Recombination Hypothesis", Leonard asks Penny out on a date after he imagined what getting back with her might be like. Their real date ends successfully and they agree to take their relationship slow in "The Beta Test Initiation". During their renewed relationship Penny has dismissed comments about him ever leaving or dumping her or about worrying about his unfaithfulness around other women and strippers as in the episode "The Stag Convergence." After Penny suggested having sex in "The Launch Acceleration", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her accidentally. They later meet and Penny does have the courage to tell him "no" and not break up with him as she did two years previously when he told her that he loved her. However, their relationship is still obviously strained. Leonard and Penny finish season 5 watching Howard being launched into space while holding hands to comfort each other. With the start of season 6, he wants a reluctant Penny to define their relationship in "The Date Night Variable".
Penny finally does admit her love to Leonard, in "The 43 Peculiarity". Penny and Leonard awkwardly stared at each other before running off in opposite directions. Leonard, though, was buoyed by optimism over Penny's admission. Alex Jensen asks Leonard out to dinner in "The Egg Salad Equivalency" which boosts Leonard's ego because two beautiful women are interested in him, however, Alex's interest makes Penny insecure. After another dispute with Sheldon, Leonard tries to move in with Penny in "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation" however she is not ready. During their Valentine's Day dinner in "The Tangible Affection Proof", Leonard again tries to propose to Penny and she cuts him off quickly. She admits that she is very happy with him, but she also admits to commitment issues and the thought of being married forever really "freaks" her out. Leonard then tells her that when she is ready to get married, she can propose to him. In the season finale, Leonard leaves for an overseas job for four months and Penny is confident enough in their relationship to wait for him.

Sheldon Cooper

Sheldon Lee Cooper PhD, is a fictional character on the CBS television series "The Big Bang Theory", portrayed by actor Jim Parsons. For his portrayal, Parsons has won three Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a TCA Award, and a Critics' Choice Television Award.
Sheldon is a theoretical physicist at Caltech who shares an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). He is a former child prodigy with genius level IQ, but has an almost total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of humor, and he experiences difficulty recognizing irony and sarcasm in other people, although he himself often employs them. He exhibits highly idiosyncratic and narcissistic behavior and a general lack of humility or empathy. These characteristics provide the majority of the humor involving him, which has caused him to be described as the show's breakout character. Despite speculation that Sheldon's personality traits may be consistent with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder and asexuality, co-creator Bill Prady has repeatedly stated that Sheldon's character was neither conceived nor developed with regard to any of these conditions.
Creation and casting.
The character of Sheldon Cooper was inspired by a computer programmer whom series co-creator Bill Prady knew. He is named in honor of actor/producer Sheldon Leonard and Nobel Prize Laureate Leon Cooper. Chuck Lorre originally intended Johnny Galecki to play the role, but Galecki thought he would be "better suited" for the character of Leonard. Lorre said that when Jim Parsons auditioned for the role, he was "so startlingly good" that he was asked to reaudition "to make sure he hadn't gotten lucky."
Characterization.
Storyline.
Sheldon was raised in Galveston, Texas by his mother, Mary Cooper, an overtly devout Evangelical Christian and George Cooper. The only member of his family to have encouraged his work in science was his grandfather, who died while Sheldon was still a child. His aunt also encouraged Sheldon by giving him medical equipment, "in case his work in physics failed."
He was interested in physics from an early age, and was a child prodigy, although due to his behavioral quirks and his lack of humility about his superior intellect, he was bullied by classmates and neighbors. Sheldon entered college at the age of eleven, and at age fourteen he graduated from college "summa cum laude." From then he worked on his doctorate, was a visiting professor at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, and was the youngest person at the time to receive the Stephenson Award.
He received his Ph.D. degree from MIT at age sixteen and is now a theoretical physicist doing research at Caltech.
Personality.
Sheldon is often described as the stereotypical "geek". He is usually characterized as extremely intelligent, socially inept, and rigidly logical. Despite his intellect, he sometimes displays a lack of common sense. He has a superiority complex, but also possesses childlike qualities, of which he seems unaware, such as extreme stubbornness. The first four episodes of "The Big Bang Theory" portray Sheldon inconsistently with his later characterization. According to Prady, the character "began to evolve after episode five or so and became his own thing."
Sheldon possesses an eidetic memory and an IQ of 187, although he claims his IQ cannot be accurately measured by normal tests. He originally claimed to have a master's degree and two doctoral degrees, but this list has increased. Sheldon has an extensive general knowledge in many subjects including physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, cosmology, algebra, calculus, differential equations, vector calculus, computers, electronics, engineering, history, geography, linguistics, and various languages like Finnish, Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, Persian, Arabic, and Klingon from "Star Trek." He also shows great talent in music, knowing how to play piano and recorder and having perfect pitch. Although his friends have similar intellects to him, his eccentricities, stubbornness, and lack of empathy often frustrate them. Sheldon occasionally uses slang (in a very unnatural fashion), and follows jokes with his catchphrase "Bazinga!" which is now an officially registered trademark of Warner Bros. He is uncomfortable with human physical contact and has germophobia, which makes his exceptionally rare hugs extremely awkward and painful-looking. Sheldon has difficulty coping when he is interrupted, when asked to keep a secret, or when he hears arguing. He is also a notary public and uses his knowledge in law and contracts usually for his own advantage and is always distressed when challenged in a legal aspect that he cannot logically defend. In his mannerisms, Sheldon also shows symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Whenever approaching a person's home, he must knock three times, then say the person's name, and must repeat this at least three times. Upon entering a person's home, he must select the proper seat before sitting down. When it is suggested by Penny that he "Just sit anywhere," his response is "Oh, no, that's crazy!" This extends to his inability to accept change. His rigidity in maintaining homeostasis often causes him frustration.
Like his friends, Sheldon is scientifically inclined and is fond of comic books (especially the DC Universe), costumes, roleplaying games, video games, tabletop games, collectible card games, action figures, fantasy and science fiction. Sheldon has restraining orders from his heroes Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan, and Stan Lee, as well as television scientist Bill Nye. Sheldon often wears vintage T-shirts adorned with superhero logos.
Sheldon has sometimes appeared to show empathy, including lending money to Penny without expecting it back quickly (although that may just have been his logical Spock-like response to a problem to be solved; it was, after all, money he was not using and would not miss) and driving her to a hospital when her shoulder was dislocated. He dislikes gifts, because the "social contract" in his view creates either a debt or burden on the receiver of the gift which will not stop until one of the two involved in the "gift-relationship" dies leaving the other either in debt or with an undue surplus. Sheldon does not take drugs, not even legal ones such as caffeine, due to a promise to his mother, and is hypersensitive when he accidentally consumes them. It has been shown, however, that alcohol often causes Sheldon to loosen up significantly, although it will also cloud his judgment – on occasion, after drinking alcoholic drinks (both deliberately and accidentally), he has done things that he would never do while sober, such as singing out loud, mooning an audience full of people, confronting Wil Wheaton and affectionately slapping Amy's rear.
In response to criticism from his friends that he is mentally ill, Sheldon often retorts, "I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested" – which his mother has confirmed to be true (once while wishing she had gone through with a follow-up examination).
Relationships.
Sheldon contrasts strongly with his family, who are neither scientists nor intellectuals. Sheldon has a twin sister, Missy, a tall, attractive brunette, and a as-yet-unseen older brother, George Jr. Both Missy and George Jr. beat Sheldon up during their childhoods, and their mother describes them to be "dumb as soup." Sheldon is very fond of his maternal grandmother, whom he calls "Meemaw" and who calls him "Moon Pie." He called his grandfather, who died when Sheldon was five, Pop Pop.
Sheldon's closest friends are Leonard Hofstadter, Howard Wolowitz, and Rajesh Koothrappali. Of the three, Sheldon is openly dismissive of Howard and constantly opines that a Master's degree in engineering demonstrates a lesser intellect than that of the others, who all possess science doctorates. Despite that, Sheldon has referred to Howard as a "treasured acquaintance" and a friend at various points. Sheldon is best friends with Leonard, as they live together and can tolerate each other. Prady stated that "the fact that, despite everything, Leonard considers Sheldon his best friend reminds us of Sheldon's essential humanity." Sheldon can only handle having a limited number of friends in his life at a time, but later shows flexibility when he accepts Bernadette and Amy as part of the social group. In Season 6, the guys ask if comic book store owner Stuart can be part of the group while Howard is in space. 
Despite Penny's neither being a scientist nor sharing many of the group's interests), and having constant fights with Sheldon in the early episodes, they became close friends. While some fans support a romantic relationship between Sheldon and Penny, Lorre has stated his opposition to it by saying: "We've stumbled into creating a character who has chosen a lifestyle for himself that is unique. And I don't see any reason to modify it."
Before his relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler, it was speculated that Sheldon may be asexual or aromantic. Series co-creator Chuck Lorre said: "Part of what's wonderful and unique about is he has chosen not to play in the relationship game either way  -- heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, any sexuality." This is referenced in "The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem", when Sheldon unknowingly attracts the attention of grad student Ramona Nowitzki, and Penny, seeing this, asks his friends what his "deal" (i.e., sexual orientation) is, to which Leonard responds, "Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no 'deal'."
In the Season 3 finale, Raj and Howard blackmail Sheldon into meeting Amy Farrah Fowler, with whom they matched him on a dating website. After some obnoxious comments about the dating website, Sheldon finds that Amy agrees with him, and he grows fond of her when she says that coitus is "off the table." The relationship continues in the fourth season, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship. The two enjoy intellectual games they create, and Amy and Sheldon openly express the same type of intellectual superiority. After Sheldon inadvertently infers that Leonard and Amy may have had sex after a wedding reception that both attended, he has an unexpectedly violent reaction, karate-chopping Leonard's neck while telling Leonard "She's not for you . . . not for you!"
In Season 5, Sheldon formally asks Amy to be his girlfriend in "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition" episode. Amy begins a campaign to give Sheldon more attention to increase his feelings for her by embracing his interests. As they watch Howard being launched into space in the season finale, "The Countdown Reflection," Amy is surprised when Sheldon takes her hand for emotional support.
During the first half of Season 6, in "The Parking Spot Escalation" and "The Fish Guts Displacement," Sheldon is pushed further after seeing Amy partially exposed and taking care of her while she is ill. In the episode "The Cooper/Kripke Inversion," after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation," Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during "The Love Spell Potential," Amy and Sheldon's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility. In the Season 7 episode "The Locomotive Manipulation", Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time; though it was more to prove a point, he prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.
He once idolized fictional prodigy Wesley Crusher from "," portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not turn up at a convention attended by Sheldon. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's all-time enemy list. Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers Barry Kripke and Leslie Winkle. Later, Wheaton managed to patch things up with Sheldon, only to inadvertently pass the enemy list spot to Brent Spiner.
Reception.
General.
Jim Parsons' portrayal of Sheldon has received widespread acclaim, and is often cited as the main reason for the program's success by critics and fans alike. James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: "It's hard to imagine what "The Big Bang Theory" would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great portrayal of Sheldon Cooper." Matt Roush of "TV Guide" stated that "there's a spark of divine inspiration in Jim Parsons' uproarious Sheldon Cooper." Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that "Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic."
On July 16, 2009, Jim Parsons was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. He was nominated again for the same award on July 8, 2010 and eventually won the award on August 29, 2010. On August 1, 2009, he won the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy, with the show itself winning the award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy for season two. He was nominated again for the same award in 2010 and 2012. Parsons was also nominated for the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor and a Satellite Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2009, 2010, and 2012. On January 16, 2011, Parsons won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco, for his work on Season 3 and 4. On June 20, 2011, he won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series at the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards for his work on Season 4, and was nominated again for the same award in 2012. On September 18, 2011, he won his second consecutive Primetime Emmy Award and was nominated again for the same award on July 19, 2012. In 2013, Parsons was nominated once again for the Golden Globe and received his first nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series.
The asteroid 246247 Sheldoncooper was named after Sheldon. In 2012, a newly discovered species of bee was named "Euglossa bazinga," after the character's noted catch phrase, "Bazinga!"
In March 2013, the Columbus Zoo named a monkey after Sheldon.
Asperger syndrome.
Some viewers have asserted that Sheldon's behavior is consistent with Asperger syndrome. The writers have stated that they did not use Asperger syndrome as a basis for the character, but instead thought of his actions as "Sheldony". Series co-creator Bill Prady stated: "We write the character as the character. A lot of people see various things in him and make the connections. Our feeling is that Sheldon's mother never got a diagnosis, so we don't have one". Prady also told Alan Sepinwell of the New Jersey "Star-Ledger" that while Sheldon shares traits with people with Asperger's, he was uncomfortable labeling Sheldon as having Asperger's.
In an interview, Jim Parsons noted the writers' response, but added that, in his opinion, Sheldon "couldn't display "more" traits" of Asperger's. Parsons, who plays Sheldon, has read John Elder Robison's memoir "Look Me in the Eye" about his life with Asperger syndrome, and said that: "A majority of what I read in that book touched on aspects of Sheldon". He also stated that "the way [Sheldon's] brain works, it's so focused on the intellectual topics at hand that thinking he's autistic is an easy leap for people watching the show to make".

How to reach Accessed by Boat through the riverfront of Varanasi 
In India, almost all the rivers are polluted by the adjoining urban settlements. Industrial growth & continuous rapid increase in population has further aggravated this pollution problem. The River Ganges, though considered the most sacred, is one of the worst affected. 
In Varanasi, people from all over India bring their dead ones for cremation & last rites, as there is an age old belief that those cremated on the bank of River Ganges at Varanasi will achieve salvation. This in turn leads to further addition to river pollution. In order to check this biological pollution and to make River Ganges free of pollutants, Ganga Action Plan (GAP) Phase I, has started in the year 1986 by the Govt. of India, with a tortoise breeding project with its breeding centre at Sarnath where tortoise (both herbivores & Carnivores) are hatched and reared for one to one and half year and then are left into River Ganges to remove the bio-pollutants like partly cremated and dead bodies directly thrown in the river. The eggs of these turtles are specially procured from river Chambal. Around 2000 tortoise are released annually in the river. Between 1987 and 2010 around 33,356 tortoises were released in the River Ganges by the Kashi Wildlife Division’s tortoise breeding centre, Sarnath. 
To protect these tortoise and secure their habitat Kachhua Sanctuary, spreading over seven km. from Rajghat (Malviya Rail Road Bridge) to Ramnagar Fort, was declared Wildlife Protection Zone, under U.P. Govt. Order (No. 4170/04-3-62/89 dated 21-12-1989) under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, after launching the Ganga Action Plan (GAP). The existence of motor boats and sand mining in the protected zone of the Sanctuary is prohibited, as tortoise lay eggs in the sand of the river banks. Tortoise Sanctuary has its own importance to clean the water. 
In the Kachhua (tortoise) Sanctuary mainly Aspederites Gangetic (self shell turtles), Geoclamis, Hamiltonai, Chitra Indica & Lasimous which are carnivorous species and hard shelled herbivorous tortoise- Pechra, Kachhua, Sundri Kachhua, Kachhua Tentoria, Kachhua Tongoka are in abundance. Rohu, Bhakur, Tengra, Prawn, Nain, Bam etc. fish are also found in the Sanctuary. Gangetic dolphin can also be seen especially during rainy season here. Tortoise and all other aquatic species are conserved/ protected and efforts are being made to increase their population in this sanctuary. 
Fishing & any attempt to temper with the habitat of the animals found in the Sanctuary, has been declared a cognizable offence in this stretch of the River Ganges, under 1972 Act.

FSV Erlangen-Bruck

The FSV Erlangen-Bruck is a German association football club from the suburb of Bruck in the city of Erlangen, Bavaria.
History.
The club was formed on 15 May 1916, during the First World War, under the name of 1. FC Markt Bruck.
For most of its existence, the football department played on local level in the Bavarian region of Middle Franconia. The club came close to "Landesliga" (IV) promotion when it finished second in the "Bezirksliga Mittelfranken-Nord" in 1971, after having been promoted to this league the year before. The club remained in the "Bezirksliga" for a number of seasons without being able to archive quite so well again and eventually was relegated again.
In 1992, the "FSV" regained its "Bezirksliga" status once more. It finished in the upper half of the table in the following seasons, gaining promotion to the "Bezirksoberliga Mittelfranken" in 1996 on the strength of a second place in the league. The club spent eight seasons in the "Bezirksoberliga" before winning the league in 2004 and gaining promotion to the "Landesliga Bayern-Mitte" for the first time.
In the "Landesliga", the club performed well, too, archiving a fifth place in its first season. The following two seasons saw the club finishing third both times. "Bayernliga" promotion was finally achieved when the club won the "Landesliga" in 2008. 
After a 29-year absence, "Bayernliga" football returned therefor to the city of Erlangen. The last club from the city to play at this level was the BSC Erlangen in 1979. 
The club established itself reasonably well in the new league, finishing in fifth place in 2008–09 and eighth in the following year. After the promotion of local rival SC Eltersdorf to the Bayernliga in 2011 the two clubs began to hold merger talks in November 2011. The club made negative headlines when it encountered financial trouble in 2011. "Bruck" averted insolvency in December 2011, caused by outstanding social security payments and wages, when it had to take up a € 220,000 credit. The club announced that it would have to cut the budget of the football department. After initially proceeding with their Regionalliga Bayern licence application the club opted not to apply for a place in this league in April 2012 and instead remain in the Bayernliga, with the clubs chairman Manfred Hopfengärtner stepping down.

Yuan Dynasty

The Yuan Dynasty (, Modern "Yuán Cháo"; Mongolian: Classical , "Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus", Modern , , "Ikh Yuanʹ Üls") also "Mongol Dynasty", was the empire established by Kublai Khan, leader of the Mongolian Borjigin clan, after he conquered the Southern Song dynasty in China. Although the Mongols had ruled territories which included today's northern China for decades, it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style. His realmthe Great Yuan Empire (t , s , p "Dà Yuán Dìguó")was by this point isolated from the other khanates and controlled only most of present-day China and its surrounding areas including modern Mongolia. It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its remnants in Mongolia were known as the Northern Yuan. Almost none of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language, using instead their native language and Mongolian and Pagshpa scripts.
The Yuan is considered both a successor to the Mongol Empire and as an imperial Chinese dynasty. In official Chinese histories, the Yuan Dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven, following the Song Dynasty and preceding the Ming Dynasty. Although the dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu.
In addition to Emperor of China, Kublai Khan also claimed the title of Great Khan, supreme over the other successor khanates: the Chagatai, the Golden Horde, and the Ilkhanate. As such, the Great Yuan Empire was also sometimes referred to as the Empire of the Great Khan. However, although this claim of the emperors of the Yuan Dynasty was at times recognized by the western khans, their subservience was merely nominal and they each continued their own separate development.
History.
Background.
Genghis Khan united the Mongol and Turkic tribes of the steppes and led a series of unprecedented campaigns against the Jin Dynasty, Western Xia, and other surrounding kingdoms in Central and East Asia. Under the reign of Genghis' third son, Ögedei Khan, the Mongols destroyed the weakened Jin Dynasty in 1234 and conquered most of northern China. Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, became Khanate of the Mongols in 1260.
Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke.
In 1259 Great Khan Möngke died while Kublai Khan, his brother, was campaigning against the Song Dynasty in South China and Ariq Böke, his other brother, commanded the Mongol homelands. A "khuraldai", or the great assembly of higher nobility took place in Karakorum, then the capital of the Mongol Empire, which proclaimed Ariq Böke as the Great Khan in the traditional Mongolian style. Hearing of this, Kublai aborted his Chinese expedition and gathered another great assembly at his headquarters in the city of Kaiping (Shangdu in present-day Inner Mongolia) and, in 1260, he was proclaimed the Great Khan. However, this assembly convened by Kublai was deemed illegitimate from the perspective of the Mongolian tradition of throne inheritance: the empire already had Ariq Böke as legitimate Great Khan, who was in the capital. In addition, it was said that that Kublai made extensive use of bribery of princes. Ariq Böke sent an ambassador to his brother: "By the state's law, the Great Khan is proclaimed by the great assembly, but you have ignored the supreme doctrine; sitting in China and, following Chinese laws, you are acting autocratically."
Kublai declared Ariq Böke to be a usurper, and, following the traditional Chinese custom, proclaimed the era name to be "Zhong-tong". According to Chinese history, Kublai Khan gained the title of Emperor ("huang di"), although the Chinese Song Dynasty at that time still resisted him in South China. In 1261–1264, he fought against his brother, and eventually Ariq Böke was defeated and surrendered to Kublai. As the winning Great Khan, Kublai Khan now expected the allegiance of other khanates.
However, at this time the khans of the Golden Horde and of the Chagatai Khanate did not recognize Kublai Khan as the Great Khan. The conflicts between Kublai Khan and the khanates in Central Asia led by Kaidu had lasted for a few decades, until the beginning of the 14th century, when both of them had died. Hülegü, another brother of Kublai Khan, ruled his Ilkhanate and paid homage to the Great Khan but actually established an autonomous khanate, and after Ilkhan Ghazan's enthronement in 1295, Kublai's successor Emperor Chengzong sent him a seal reading "王府定國理民之寶" in Chinese script to symbolize this.
The seal, in Chinese script, reads "Seal certifying the authority of his Royal Highness to establish a country and govern its people". Vatican Archives.</ref> The four major successor khanates never came again under true one rule, and border clashes also frequently occurred among them, although Yuan Dynasty's nominal supremacy was recognized by the other three after the death of Kaidu.
Founding of the Dynasty.
From the beginning of his reign (1260), Kublai Khan had adopted many customs from earlier Chinese dynasties, such as era names and bureaucracy. He had several Chinese teachers attached to him since his early years. Not only did they teach him Chinese history and ideology, but permanently gave advice on governance.
After winning the war against Ariq Böke, Kublai Khan began his reign over his empire with greater aspirations and self-confidence. In 1264, he transferred his headquarters to the Daning Palace northeast of the former Jurchen capital Zhongdu. In 1266, he ordered the construction of his new capital around that site's Taiye Lake, establishing what is now the central core of Beijing. The city came to be known as Khanbaliq ("City of the Khans") and Daidu to the Turks and Mongols and Dadu (, "Great Capital") to the Chinese. As early as 1264, Kublai decided to change the era name from Zhongtong (中統) to Zhiyuan (至元). With the desire to rule all of China, Kublai Khan formally claimed the Mandate of Heaven by proclaiming the new Yuan Dynasty in 1271 in the traditional Chinese style. This would become the first non-Han dynasty to rule all of China.
The official title of the Dynasty, Da Yuan (, "Great Yuan"), originates from a Chinese classic text called "I Ching", "大哉乾元" (dà zāi qián yuán), literally translating to 'Great is the Heavenly and Primal', with "qián" being the symbol of the Heaven, and the Emperor. Therefore, Yuan was the first dynasty in China to use Da (, "Great") in its official title, as well as being the first dynasty to use a title that did not correspond to an ancient region in China. In 1271, Khanbaliq officially became the capital of the Yuan Dynasty.
In the early 1270s, Kublai began his massive drive against Southern Song Dynasty in South China. By 1273, Kublai had blockaded the Yangzi River with his navy and besieged Xiangyang, the last obstacle in his way to capture the rich Yangzi River basin. In 1275, a Song force of 130,000 troops under Chancellor Jia Sidao was defeated by the Yuan force. By 1276, most of the Southern Song territory had been captured by Yuan forces. In 1279, the Yuan army led by the Chinese general Zhang Hongfan had crushed the last Song resistance at the Battle of Yamen, which marked the end of the Southern Song and the onset of a united China under the Yuan. The Yuan Dynasty is traditionally given credit for reuniting China after several hundred years of fragmentation following the fall of the Tang Dynasty.
After the founding of the dynasty, Kublai Khan was put under pressure by many of his advisers to further expand the sphere of influence of the Yuan through the traditional Sinocentric tributary system. However, the attempts to establish such tributary relationships were rebuffed and expeditions to Japan (twice), Dai Viet (twice during Kublai's rule), and Java, would later meet with less success. Kublai established a puppet state in Myanmar, which caused anarchy in the area, and the Pagan Kingdom was broken up into many regions warring with each another. In order to avoid more bloodshed and conflicts with the Mongols, Annam and Champa later established nominal tributary relations with the Yuan Dynasty.
Rule of Kublai Khan.
Unlike his predecessors, Kublai established a government with institutions resembling the ones in earlier Chinese dynasties and made reforms to maintain his centralized rule.
Kublai Khan was seen as a martial emperor, reforming much of China and its institutions, a process that would have taken decades to complete. For example, he consolidated his rule by centralizing the government of China — making himself (unlike his predecessors) an absolute monarch. He divided his empire into "Xing Zhongshusheng" (行中書省), usually translated as "branch Secretariat" or "province", each governing the areas of approximately two or three modern-day Chinese provinces, and this provincial-level government structure became the model for later Ming and Qing dynasties. Kublai Khan also reformed many other governmental and economic institutions, especially the tax system. Kublai Khan sought to govern China through traditional institutions, and also recognized that in order to rule China he needed to employ Han Chinese advisers and officials, though he never relied totally on Chinese advisers. Yet, the Hans were discriminated against politically. Almost all important central posts were monopolized by Mongols, who also preferred employing non-Hans from other parts of the Mongol domain in those positions for which no Mongol could be found. Hans were more often employed in non-Chinese regions of the empire. In essence, society was divided into four classes in order of privilege: Mongols, Semu ("Various sorts", for example: Central Asians), Northerners, and Southerners. During his lifetime, Kublai Khan built the capital of the Yuan, Khanbaliq at the site of present-day central Beijing and made Shangdu (, "Upper Capital", known to Marco Polo as Xanadu) the summer capital. He also improved the agriculture of China, extending the Grand Canal, highways and public granaries. Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant who served under Kublai Khan as an official, described his rule as benevolent: relieving the populace of taxes in times of hardship; building hospitals and orphanages; distributing food among the abjectly poor.
He also promoted science and religion, and strongly supported the Silk Road trade network, allowing the contacts between Chinese technologies and the western ones. It is worth mentioning that prior to meeting Marco Polo, Kublai Khan had met Niccolò Polo, Marco Polo's father and Matteo Polo. Through conversation with the two merchants, Kublai Khan developed a keen interest in the Latin world especially Christianity and sought to invite a hundred of missionaries through a letter written in Latin to the Pope so that they may convince the masses of idolators the errors of their belief. Thus Niccolò and Maffeo Polo served as ambasadors for Kublai Khan to the West. After having completed their mission of accompanying a young Mongol princess to marry the Mongol ruler Arghun, their perilous journey would end with them returning to Venice and meeting young Marco Polo of seventeen in 1271. The three returned to the East and once again met with Kublai Khan, and it was said that Marco Polo served as an emissary of Kublai Khan throughout his domain for seventeen years. Although Niccolò and Maffeo failed to bring back any missionaries with them or a letter from the Pope due to the Great Schism, they were successful in returning with oil from the lamp of God in Jerusalem. Marco Polo's travels would later inspire many others like Christopher Columbus to chart the passage to the "Middle Kingdom" the realm of the East, present day China in search of wealth and splendor.
He issued paper banknotes known as Chao (鈔) in 1273. Paper currency had been issued and used in China before Yuan time; by 960, the Song Dynasty, short of copper for striking coins, issued the first generally circulating notes. However, during the Song Dynasty, paper money was used alongside the coins. On the other hand, Yuan was the first dynasty in China to use paper currency as the predominant circulating medium. The Yuan bureaucrats made paper bills from the mulberry bark paper.
While he had claimed nominal supremacy over the rest of the Mongol Empire, his interest was clearly in China, along with the areas in its traditional Sinocentric tributary system. From the beginning of his reign, the other three khanates of the Mongol Empire became de facto independent and only one recognized him as Khagan. By the time of Kublai Khan’s death in 1294, this separation has deepened, although later Yuan emperors had nominal supremacy in the west til the end of their rule in China. The temple name given for Kublai Khan is Shizu ().
Early rulers after Kublai.
Following the conquest of Dali in AD 1253, the former ruling Duan dynasty were appointed as governors-general, recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era governments, principally in the province of Yunnan. Succession for the Yuan Dynasty, however, was an intractable problem, later causing much strife and internal struggle. This emerged as early as the end of Kublai's reign. Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin () as the Crown Prince () — but he died before Kublai in 1285. Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother Kökejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Temür Khan or Emperor Chengzong for approximately 10 years following Kublai's death (between 1294 and 1307). Temür Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather. He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as the neighboring countries such as Vietnam, which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades. However, the corruption in the Yuan Dynasty began during the reign of Temür Khan.
Külüg Khan (Emperor Wuzong) came to the throne after the death of Temür Khan. Unlike his predecessor, he did not continue Kublai's work, but largely rejected it. Most significantly he introduced a policy called "New Deals", and the central of this policy were monetary reforms. During his short reign (1307 to 1311), the government fell into financial difficulties, partly due to bad decisions made by Külüg. By the time he died, China was in severe debt and the Yuan court faced popular discontent.
The fourth Yuan emperor, Buyantu Khan (Ayurbarwada) was a competent emperor. He was the first among the Yuan emperors who actively supported and adopted the mainstream Chinese culture after the reign of Kublai, to the discontent of some Mongol elite. He had been mentored by Li Meng, a Confucian academic. He made many reforms, including the liquidation of the Department of State Affairs (), which resulted in the execution of 5 of the highest-ranking officials. Starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials, testing their knowledge on significant historical works. Also, he codified much of the law, as well as publishing or translating a number of Chinese books and works.
The next emperor, Gegeen Khan, Ayurbarwada's son and successor, continued his father's policies to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor Baiju. During his reign, the Da Yuan Tong Zhi (Chinese: 大元通制, "the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan"), a huge collection of codes and regulations of the Yuan Dynasty began by his father, was formally promulgated.
Later years of the Dynasty.
The last years of the Yuan Dynasty were marked by struggle, famine, and bitterness among the populace. In time, Kublai Khan's successors lost all influence on other Mongol lands across Asia, while the Mongols beyond the Middle Kingdom saw them as too Chinese. Gradually, they lost influence in China as well. The reigns of the later Yuan emperors were short and were marked by intrigues and rivalries. Uninterested in administration, they were separated from both the army and the populace. China was torn by dissension and unrest; outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening Yuan armies.
Regardless of the merits of his reign, Shidebala (Emperor Yingzong) ruled for only two years (1321 to 1323); his rule ended in a coup at the hands of five princes. They placed Yesün Temür (or Taidingdi) on the throne, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to calm the princes, he also succumbed to regicide. Before Yesün Temür's reign, China had been relatively free from popular rebellions after the reign of Kublai. Yuan control, however, began to break down in those regions inhabited by ethnic minorities. The occurrence of these revolts and the subsequent suppression aggravated the financial difficulties of the Yuan government. The government had to adopt some measure to increase revenue such as selling offices, as well as curtailing its spending on some items.
When Yesün Temür died in Shangdu in 1328, Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by the Qipchaq commander El Temür. He was installed as the emperor (Emperor Wenzong) in Khanbaliq while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support of Yesün Temür's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah. Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh in 1329. Afterwards, Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only 4 days after a banquet with Tugh Temür. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne. Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign. El Temür purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty.
Due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by El Temür, Tugh Temür is known for his cultural contribution instead. He adopted many measures honoring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values. His most concrete effort to patronize Chinese learning was his founding of the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature (), first established in the spring of 1329, and was designed to undertake "a number of tasks relating to the transmission of Confucian high culture to the Mongolian imperial establishment". The academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books, but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named Jingshi Dadian (). He supported Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism and also devoted himself in Buddhism.
After the death of Tugh Temür in 1332 and subsequently the death of Rinchinbal (Emperor Ningzong) in the end of the same year, the 13-year-old Toghun Temür (Emperor Huizong), the last of the nine successors of Kublai Khan, was summoned back from Guangxi and succeeded to the throne after El Temür's death. Nevertheless, Bayan became another powerful official as El Temür was in the beginning of his long reign. As Toghun Temür grew, he came to disapprove of Bayan's autocratic rule. In 1340 he allied himself with Bayan's nephew Toqto'a, who was in discord with Bayan, and banished Bayan by coup. With the dismissal of Bayan, Toghtogha seized the power of the court. His first administration clearly exhibited fresh new spirit. He also gave a few early signs of a new and positive direction in central government. One of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the Liao, Jin and Song dynasties, which were eventually completed in 1345. Yet, Toghtogha resigned his office with the approval of Toghun Temür, which marked the end of his first administration, and he was not called back until 1349.
From the late 1340s onwards, people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts, floods and the resulting famines, and the government's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support. In 1351, the Red Turban Rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising. In 1354, when Toghtogha led a large army to crush the Red Turban rebels, Toghun Temür suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal. This resulted in Toghun Temür's restoration of power on the one hand and a rapid weakening of the central government on the other. He had no choice but to rely on local warlords' military power, and gradually lost his interest in politics and ceased to intervene in political struggles. He fled north to Xanadu from Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing) in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the Míng Dynasty (1368–1644), founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in the south. He had tried to regain Khanbaliq, which eventually failed; he died in Yingchang (located in present-day Inner Mongolia) two years later (1370). Yingchang was seized by the Ming shortly after his death. Some royal family members still lived in Henan today.
The Prince of Liang, Basalawarmi established a separate pocket of resistance to the Ming in Yunnan and Guizhou, but his forces were decisively defeated by the Ming in 1381. By 1388 the remaining Yuan forces in Manchuria under Nahacu had also surrendered to the Ming Dynasty.
Northern Yuan.
The Yuan remnants retreated to Mongolia after the fall of Yingchang to the Ming in 1370, where the name Great Yuan (大元) was formally carried on, and is known as the Northern Yuan (北元). According to Chinese political orthodoxy, there could be only one legitimate dynasty whose rulers were blessed by Heaven to rule as Emperor of China (see Mandate of Heaven), and so the Ming and the Northern Yuan denied each other's legitimacy as emperors of China, although the Ming did consider the previous Yuan which it had succeeded to be a legitimate dynasty. Historians generally regard Míng Dynasty rulers as the legitimate emperors of China after the Yuan Dynasty, though Northern Yuan rulers also claimed to rule over China, and continued to resist the Ming under the name "Yuan" or "Northern Yuan".
The Ming army pursued the Northern Yuan forces into Mongolia in 1372, but were defeated by the latter under Ayushridar and his general Köke Temür. They tried again in 1380, ultimately winning a decisive victory over Northern Yuan in 1388. About 70,000 Mongols were taken prisoner, and Karakorum (the Northern Yuan capital) was sacked. Eight years later, the Northern Yuan throne was taken over by Yesüder, a descendant of Ariq Böke, instead of the descendants of Kublai Khan. The following centuries saw a succession of Genghisid rulers, many of whom were mere figureheads put on the throne by those warlords who happened to be the most powerful. Periods of conflict with the Ming Dynasty intermingled with periods of peaceful relations with border trade. In 1402, Örüg Temür Khan (Guilichi) abolished the name Great Yuan; he was however defeated by Öljei Temür Khan (Bunyashiri), protege of Tamerlane (Timur Barulas) in 1403. A few decades later the new khan Batumongke (1464–1517/43) took the title "Dayan" meaning "Da Yuan" or "Great Yuan". and reunited the Mongols. His successors continued to rule until the submission to the Qing Dynasty, ending the Northern Yuan in 1635.
Impact.
A rich cultural diversity developed during the Yuan Dynasty. The major cultural achievements were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular. The political unity of China and much of central Asia promoted trade between East and West. The Mongols' extensive West Asian and European contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange. The other cultures and peoples in the Mongol World Empire also very much influenced China. It had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia until its decline; the communications between Yuan Dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate, encouraged this development. Buddhism had a great influence in the Yuan government, and the Tibetan-rite Tantric Buddhism had significantly influenced China during this period. The Muslims of the Yuan Dynasty introduced Middle Eastern cartography, astronomy, medicine, clothing, and diet in East Asia. Eastern crops such as carrots, turnips, new varieties of lemons, eggplants, and melons, high-quality granulated sugar, and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the Yuan Dynasty.
Western musical instruments were introduced to enrich Chinese performing arts. From this period dates the conversion to Islam, by Muslims of Central Asia, of growing numbers of Chinese in the northwest and southwest. Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism also enjoyed a period of toleration. Buddhism (especially Tibetan Buddhism) flourished, although Taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of Buddhism from the Yuan government. Confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the Classics, which had fallen into disuse in north China during the period of disunity, were reinstated by the Yuan court, probably in the hope of maintaining order over Han society. Advances were realized in the fields of travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education.
Certain Chinese innovations and products, such as purified saltpetre, printing techniques, porcelain, playing cards and medical literature, were exported to Europe and Western Asia, while the production of thin glass and cloisonné became popular in China. The Yuan exercised a profound influence on the Chinese Ming Dynasty. The Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang (1368–97) admired the Mongols' unification of China and adopted its garrison system.
The first recorded travels by Europeans to China and back date from this time. The most famous traveler of the period was the Venetian Marco Polo, whose account of his trip to "Cambaluc," the capital of the Great Khan, and of life there astounded the people of Europe. The account of his travels, "Il milione" (or, "The Million", known in English as the "Travels of Marco Polo"), appeared about the year 1299. Some argue the accuracy of Marco Polo's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the Great Wall of China, tea houses, which would have been a prominent sight since Europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture, as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the Great Khan. Some suggest that Marco Polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with Persian traders since many of the places he named were in Persian.
The Yuan undertook extensive public works, and of Kublai Khan's top engineers and scientists, was the astronomer Guo Shoujing who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the Yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days out of the year, which was only 26 seconds off the modern Gregorian calendar's measurement. Road and water communications were reorganized and improved. To provide against possible famines, granaries were ordered built throughout the empire. The city of Beijing was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes, hills and mountains, and parks. During the Yuan period, Beijing became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China, which was completely renovated. These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Asia and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe. Chinese travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering. Contacts with the West also brought the introduction to China of a major food crop, sorghum, along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation.
The Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) was the first time that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China. In the historiography of Mongolia, it is generally considered to be the continuation of the Mongol Empire. Mongols are widely known to worship the Eternal Heaven, and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan is considered to be "the beginning of an infinite number of beings, the foundation of peace and happiness, state power, the dream of many peoples, besides it there is nothing great or precious" which conquered the whole China. In traditional historiography of China on the other hand, the Yuan Dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the Song Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty. Note, however, Yuan Dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271, partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu (). Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views (including the government of the Ming Dynasty which overthrew the Yuan Dynasty), there also exist Chinese people who did not consider Yuan Dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China, but a period of foreign domination. The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens, and China stagnated economically and scientifically.
Government.
The structure of the Yuan government took shape during the reign of Kublai Khan (1260–1294). While some changes took place such as the functions of certain institutions, the essential components of the government bureaucracy remained intact from the beginning to the end of the dynasty in 1368.
The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols and Tibetan Buddhists. While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat () to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council () to manage military affairs, and the Censorate () to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions however showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs () mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but usually became abandoned shortly afterwards.
While the existence of these central government departments and the Six Ministries (which had been introduced since the Sui and Tang dynasties) gave a sinicized image in the Yuan administration, the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how Mongolian priorities and policies reshape and redirect those institutions. For example, the authority of the Yuan legal system, the Ministry of Justice did not extend to legal cases involving Mongols and Semuren, where there were separate courts of justice for them. Cases involving members of more than one ethnic group were decided by a mixed board consisting of Chinese and Mongols. Another example was the insignificance of the Ministry of War compared with native Chinese dynasties, as the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council.
Society.
Imperial lifestyle.
Since its invention in 1269, the 'Phags-pa script, a unified script for spelling Mongolian' Tibetan, and Chinese languages, was preserved in the court until the end of the Dynasty. Most of the Emperors could not master written Chinese, but they could generally converse well in the language. The Mongol custom of long standing quda/marriage alliance with Mongol clans, the Onggirat and the Ikeres, kept the imperial blood purely Mongol until the reign of Tugh Temur whose mother was a Tangut concubine. The Mongol Emperors had built large palaces and pavilions, but some still continued to live as nomads at times. Nevertheless, a few other Yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities; an example is Tugh Temur (Emperor Wenzong), who wrote poetry, painted, read Chinese classical texts, and ordered compilation of books.
Kublai and his successors kept a Tibetan lama of the Sakya order at court. Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobels delighted in patronizing Confucian scholars and institutions. A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into Mongolian language.
The average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan Dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure, with income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty. The Mongols practiced debt slavery and by 1290 in all parts of the Mongol Empire Mongol commoners were selling their children into slavery. Seeing this as damaging the Mongol nation, Kublai forbade the sale abroad of the Mongols in 1291, and likewise Ilkhan Ghazan (1295–1304) in Persia budgeted funds to redeem Mongol slaves.
Culture.
In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development. These developments included the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today. Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan Dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan Dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the "qu", which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the "sanqu" type of "qu". One of the key factors in the mix of the "zaju variety show" was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer "qu" form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type which tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the "qu" form of poetry and the "zaju" variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan Dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin, in Japan.
Social classes.
Politically, the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong "colonial" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty had also mentioned about the discrimination existed during the Yuan Dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of "barbarians" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: "... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only "Mongols and Tartars" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them".
The Mongols had employed foreigners long before the reign of Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan Dynasty. But during Kublai's reign a hierarchy of reliability was introduced in China. The population was divided into the following classes:
Partner merchants and non-Mongol overseers were usually either immigrants or local ethnic groups. Thus, in China they were Uighurs, Turkestani and Persian Muslims, and Christians. Foreigners from outside the Mongol Empire entirely, such as the Polo family, were everywhere welcomed.
Despite the high position given to Muslims, some policies of the Yuan Emperors severe discriminated against them, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision, as well as Kosher butchering for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim Generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim Generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had the name in Chinese which meant "baracks" and also mean "thanks", many Hui Muslims claim it is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was named in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.
Administrative divisions.
The territory of the Yuan Dynasty was divided into the Central Region (腹裏) and places under control of various Xing Zhongshusheng (行中書省 or 行省) or the Xuanzheng Yuan (宣政院).
The Central Region, consisting of present-day Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, the south-eastern part of present-day Inner Mongolia and the Henan areas to the north of the Yellow River, was considered the most important region of the dynasty and directly governed by Zhongshusheng (中書省, "Secretariat") at Khanbaliq; similarly, another top-level administrative department called the Xuanzheng Yuan governed the whole of modern-day Tibet and a part of Kashmir.
Xing Zhongshusheng (行中書省, "branch Secretariat" or "en-route Secretariat"), or simply Xingsheng (行省), were provincial-level administrative organizations or institutions, sometimes roughly translated as "Province", though they were not exactly provinces in modern sense. There were 11 Xing Zhongshusheng or Xingsheng in Yuan Dynasty.
Below the level of Xing Zhongshusheng or Xingsheng, the largest political division was the circuit (道), followed by prefectures (府) operating under a prefect and subprefectures (州) under a subprefect. The lowest political division was the county (縣) overseen by a magistrate. This government structure at the provincial level was later copied by the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Edward Klima

Edward S. Klima (June 21, 1931 – September 25, 2008) was an eminent linguist who specialized in the study of sign languages. Klima's work was heavily influenced by Noam Chomsky's then-revolutionary theory of the biological basis of linguistics, and applied that analysis to sign languages.
Klima, much of whose work was in collaboration with his wife, Ursula Bellugi, was among the first to prove that sign languages are complete languages and have complex grammars that have all the features of grammars of oral languages. Widespread recognition of this fact was one of the catalysts to the cultural changes in and towards the deaf community in favor of encouraging the use sign language, which had often been discouraged in favor of lip reading in the past.
Klima studied linguistics at Dartmouth College, earning his bachelor's degree in 1953. Two years later, he received a masters in the same subject from Harvard University. Starting in 1957, Klima worked as an Instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Noam Chomsky. After earning his Ph.D in linguistics from Harvard University in 1965, he joined the linguistics department at the University of California, San Diego. Later he also became an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where his wife is a professor, and director of the Laboratory for Cognitive Neuroscience (of which Klima acted as associate director).

Lucknow Zoo

Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens or popularly known as Lucknow Zoological Gardens (Hindi: लखनऊ चिड़ियाघर, Urdu: لکھنؤ چڑیاگھر "Lakhnaū Ciṛiyāghara") is a zoo located in the heart of the capital city of Uttar Pradesh. The Central Zoo Authority of India categorizes it as a large zoo. The Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens, popularly known as Lucknow Zoological Gardens, was established in the year 1921 to commemorate the visit of His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales to Lucknow. The idea of establishing Zoological gardens at Lucknow emanated from Sir Harcourt Butler, the then Governor of the State.
History.
The Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens, popularly known as Lucknow Zoological Gardens, was established in the year 1921 to commemorate the visit of His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales to Lucknow. The idea of establishing Zoological gardens at Lucknow emanated from Sir Harcourt Butler, the then Governor of the State and it was received enthusiastically by the prominent landlords and the leading citizens of the State who donated liberally for the construction of animal houses and cages and also presented animals and birds for display from time to time.
A Committee of management was formed consisting of donors and other prominent citizens. Colonel Fanthorpe, Commissioner of Lucknow was appointed as the first President and Sheikh Maqbool Husain as first Secretary of the Commission. The Committee was registered under the Societies Registration Act on 17 August 1926.
Mr. Lintle Bogla, M.C., and Chief Engineer of the Lucknow Improvement Trust designed the layout of the Zoo along with its buildings and cages. 26 buildings along with cages were constructed at a total cost of Rs. 2,08,800 during the period from 1921 to 1926. The main gate on the Narahi side known as "Sir Ludovic Porter Gate" facing west was constructed in 1936.
In the year 1950, the Managing Committee was dissolved and an Advisory Committee was formed with the Secretary to Govt., U.P., Public Health Department as its Chairman and the Director of Medical & Health Services, Uttar Pradesh as "Ex Officio" Administrator. In 1966, the administrative control was transferred to the Forest Department and the Advisory Committee was also re-organised with Secretary to Govt., U.P., Forest Department as its Chairman and the Dy. Chief Conservator of Forests (Planning) as "Ex-Officio" Administrator. From time to time, the reorganisation of the Zoo Advisory Committee was done and presently the new Zoo Advisory Committee, constituted vide Government order No. 1652/14-4-2001-866/93 dated 04-08-2001, is under existence. The new Zoo Advisory Committee consists of the Forest Secretary to the Govt, of Uttar Pradesh as Chairman, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Uttar Pradesh as Vice Chairman and Chief Wildlife Warden, Uttar Pradesh as Administrator. The Director of the Zoo is the Member Secretary of the newly constituted Zoo Advisory Committee.
The Uttar Pradesh Govt, vide letter No. 1552/14-4-2001-30/90, Van Anubhag-4, dated 4 June 2001, changed the name of "Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens.Trust, Lucknow" to "Lucknow Prani Udyan".
Management.
The zoo is being managed as a trust by the Zoo Advisory Committee, with Forest Secretary to the Govt. of Uttar Pradesh as Chairman, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Uttar Pradesh as Vice Chairman and Chief Wildlife Warden, Uttar Pradesh as Administrator. An officer of the rank of Deputy Conservator of Forests is posted as Director for over all day-to-day management of the zoo. In 2012, there was a proposition to start a cell-bank or a 'frozen zoo' for the conservation of endangered species. The proposal is still under consideration. 
Attractions.
Different Species.
The Zoo receives about 1,100,000–1,200,000 visitors annually.

A Toy train was started in 1969. The rolling stock consisting of engine and two coaches is the gift of Railway Board. The train was inaugurated on the Children's Day 14 November 1969 by the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. The track is long and has crossings and signals. Rides start from Chandrapuri station and travels to almost every section of the zoo.
The glorious chapter in Lucknow’s history will came to an end on Wednesday, November 21, 2013 as the journey of the ‘toy train’ that chugged in the city zoo for the last four decades, came to a halt. The 44–year–old toy train, that carried lakhs on it, was pulled out of service owing to plans of a revamp. The toy train has been parked in front of the state museum in the zoo premises. It was gifted to Lucknow zoo in 1969 by the Railway Board.
A new ‘Shatabdi–look–alike’ four–bogey toy train made by a Noida based company started operating in the zoo premises on February 28, 2014. The new track alignment laid from 22 November 2013 onwards ensured that the new train could cover the maximum sightseeing area of the zoo.
Vintage train.
A British-era train will be an added attraction for visitors to the city zoo. The train was shifted to the zoo from Maharajganj, where it was lying almost discarded. The train belongs to 1924-period and was mainly used for transportation of timber between Ikma and Chauraha over a track of . In 1978 it was brought over to the forest department for use but being an uneconomical option, it was decided in 1981 that it would be phased out.
State Museum, Lucknow.
The Uttar Pradesh State Museum (Timing: 10.30 am to 4.30 pm; Closed on Mondays and certain public holidays) in Lucknow, was earlier situated in the Chattar Manzil and the Lal Baradari. It was shifted during the year 1963 to the new building in Lucknow Zoo (Banarasi Bag or Prince Of Wales Zoological Garden). The initial collection centered around the arts of Avadh and objects related to the customs, habits, mythology and contemporary objects of Awadh, but later on it was expanded to more interesting excavated antiquities from nearby places of Lucknow particularly where Lord Buddha grew up.
Today, the Museum has become a centre of Lucknow's (Awadh's) sculpture, bronzes, paintings, natural history & anthropological specimens, coins, textiles and decorative arts. The (1000 BC) Egyptian Mummy and wooden sarcophagusure in the Prince of Wales Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) are a centre of attraction. From the vast number of displayed objects, some hundred are rare and of great value. These include an inscribed wine jar bearing the name of Aurangzeb Alamgir (17th century), a jade chamakali with the name Jahangir and the date 1036 AD, a 16th-century painting of a scene from the Kalpasutra depicting an elephof India. Gradually, it expanded to include excavated antiquities from Piparahawa, Kapilavastu, where the Buddha grew up. Today, this has evolved into a multipurpose museum with sculpture, bronuated in the historic Dhoti Chhattar Manzil and the Lai Baradari. Among other attractions is a modern structant rider and a Jain mum, a 16th-century copy of the Harivansha in Persian with nine illustrations, rare silver and gold coins, a prehistoric anthropomorphic figure and a fossilised plant.

1971 Rose Bowl

The 1971 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 1971. It was the 57th Rose Bowl Game. The Stanford Indians defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 27-17. The MVP was Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett.
Ohio State.
Ohio State started the season ranked #1 and proceeded to roll off 5 easy wins by a combined score of 195-60. In their sixth game, they beat #20 Northwestern in Columbus, 24-10. But for some reason, Texas leapfrogged Ohio State to #1 after beating unranked Rice 45-21 that same day. The next week the Buckeyes won at Wisconsin 24-10 and dropped another spot to #3 as Notre Dame moved up to #2. After a 10-7 win at Purdue, they fell to #5 despite still being undefeated, as Nebraska and Michigan passed them. They earned the Rose Bowl berth on the strength of their 20-9 victory over #4 Michigan in the game that decided the Big 10 title and rose back to #3. A week later, Notre Dame was upset by USC and Ohio State was back at #2 behind Texas. After Texas had lost to Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl earlier in the day, Ohio State went into the Rose Bowl with a chance to claim the national championship with a win.
Stanford.
Stanford started the season ranked #10, and in the season opener they upset #4 Arkansas at Little Rock, 34-28. After an easy win over San Jose State, they traveled to Eugene, Oregon for a game that featured a quarterback battle between Stanford's Jim Plunkett and Oregon's Dan Fouts. Stanford won 33-10, but then were caught looking ahead to their showdown with USC and lost at home to Purdue, 24-16. They then beat 3-time defending Pacific 8 champion USC at Stanford, 24-14 (avenging a last second loss to the Trojans the year before). An easy 63-16 win over conference doormat Washington State boosted the Indians to #8. Next up was a showdown with #16 UCLA in Los Angeles for the conference lead. In what was expected to be another quarterback showdown between Plunkett and the Bruins' Dennis Dummit, the defenses dominated in Stanford's key 9-7 win. After an easy win over Oregon State, they rose to #6 before clinching the conference title in the Rose Bowl decider over Sonny Sixkiller and Washington, 29-22. They then suffered a pair of letdowns, losing to #13 Air Force 31-14 and to arch rival California, 22-14. In retrospect, the Pac-8 standings were so tightly bunched, that a win by either Oregon, UCLA, or Washington over Stanford would have sent that team to the Rose Bowl instead.
Aftermath.
Stanford's upset prevented Ohio State from claiming the national championship. That honor went to third-ranked Nebraska, which defeated No. 5 LSU, 17-12 in the Orange Bowl.

The Pacemakers Drum and Bugle Corps

The Pacemakers Drum and Bugle Corps is a Division 2 marching band currently competing in BYBA (British Youth Band Association). The Pacemakers is based in St Mary Cray, in Kent
History.
The Band was originally formed in the early 1950s as the 13th Chislehurst and District Boys' Brigade Band, playing Bb bugles.
On 17 April 1952, band instructor Ron Eden agreed to commence bugle lessons for the Company members.
By 2 July of that year, a drum class had also been started.
On 8 February 1953 the Company band made its first appearance at the monthly Church parade.
13 December saw the band lead the Boys' Brigade Battalion Church parade.
By the late 1950s and early 1960s the band had grown in numbers and standard, taking part in many local and London District BB Competitions. It was in 1965 that the name of The 13th Bromley Boys Brigade first appeared, when the Greater London Boroughs changed their names and the old Chislehurst District became the new Bromley Battalion.
Saturday 11 May 1968 saw the combined bands of both The 13th Bromley Boys Brigade and the 1st St Mary Cray Girls' Brigade play together for the first time at the BB London District Display at the Royal Albert Hall.
The following year(1969) they were also asked to play again at the Girls' Brigade Annual Rally.
During the summer of 1971 the band entered its very first non-BB competition: "The Kent Band Championships" in Maidstone. This required a completely different concept of drill and music than the corps was used to. To everyone's surprise, however, the band won that first contest.
1975 saw the band take part in the Lord Mayor's Show in the City of London.
In 1977 the band participated in the Queen's Silver Jubilee display in Windsor Great Park and the Queen's Parade in Central London.
Between 1976 and 1980 the band was a regular competitor at the Boys' Brigade National Band Championships, winning the Webb Ivory Trophy for the best Bb band five years in a row.
In the '80s, some major changes were put in place. The traditional Bb bugles were switched for American 'G' valve bugles.
In 1980 the Pacemakers became one of the founding members of DCUK (Drum Corps UK) and to the present date are the only one of the original corps still performing.
The first ever DCUK Finals saw the Pacemakers take 6th place.
During this period, the band also became members of BYBA (British Youth Band Association) and still continue that membership at the present date.
In 1990 the Pacemakers returned for the Royal Family's benefit once again, playing a fanfare for HRH, the Queen Mother at the re-opening of the Imperial War Museum in London.
Since 2000 the band has seen an increase in playing members and improving performances. This was demonstrated in promotion to BYBA Division 2, winning the Division 3 finalsand the Boys' Brigade National Championships for the third time, in 2003.
Every year since 2004 the band have performed for the Chelsea pensioners at the Royal Chelsea Hospital, as part of the BB London District Display.
By 2005 the Pacemakers had returned to the BB national Band Championships in Stoke-on-Trent and were competing in Division 2 of BYBA.
In 2007 the Pacemakers undertook some major fund raising, enabling it to refurbish the pit line and purchase a brand new brass line, in Bb once again.
2009 saw the corps compete in BYBA Division 2 and renter DCUK after many years absence.
The 2010 season saw The Pacemakers promoted to the Associate Division in BYBA and compete mainly in DCUK with a brand NEW GUARD LINE.
2011 has seen the corps take a step forward, by taking a step back. Performing a new rendition of the widely popular, with both band and spectators, Jewish Trilogy in their show 'Back to Classics'. This season saw the corps be very successful, they even managed to obtain the BYBA Division Two League Champions Title, and narrowly missed the BYBA Finals winning place.

Old Buckenham Hall School

Old Buckenham Hall School (commonly known as OBH) is a day and boarding preparatory school for boys and girls in the village of Brettenham, Suffolk, England. 
Founded in 1862, OBH currently accommodates about 100 boys and 50 girls between the ages of 2 and 13 years.
Present school.
The School is currently split into the three parts;
OBH is located in about of parkland in the heart of the Suffolk village of Brettenham. The school puts great emphasis on a balanced, well-rounded, 'be the best you can' education driven by family values and Christian principles. Its pupils do well in the Common Entrance system, going on to a wide range of leading public schools such as Uppingham, Harrow, Oundle, Radley and Eton.
History.
The school was founded as a boys school in 1862 by Misses Ellen and Margaret Ringer in the Suffolk coastal town of Lowestoft under the name 'South Lodge Preparatory School'. The school remained there for 75 years before moving to much larger premises at Old Buckenham Hall in the village of Old Buckenham, Norfolk. Here the school really started to grow. In December 1952, disaster struck and the Hall was burnt down by fire. In January of the following year the school found new premises at Merton Hall near Thetford, Norfolk. Here the school tried to pick up the pieces and get back on track but disaster struck again with a second fire in January 1956. The school's survival was seriously put in question and several possibilities were discussed as to what to do next. In short, the school became aware that Brettenham Park in Suffolk had come onto the market and the property was acquired. The school (now known as Old Buckenham Hall School) moved in September 1956 and soon became well established. The school has been on this site ever since, first taking on girls in the 1990s. Current headmaster is John Brett MA - formerly headmaster of St. Mary's Prep School in Melrose, Scotland.
Sports and activities.
The school makes use of its many sports pitches and facilities (2 rugby pitches, 5 football and 6 hockey pitches, 5 cricket squares, 6 tennis courts, all-weather netball courts, a nine-hole golf course and an outdoor heated swimming pool) with the pupils spending 5 afternoons a week playing games. Pupils at OBH play a wide variety of sports including: rugby, hockey, cricket, tennis, football, athletics, gymnastics, cross-country, golf, swimming, netball, squash and badminton.
Being a predominantly boarding school, the school offers a wide range of activities for the pupils including: archery, sailing, riding, lacrosse, clay-pigeon shooting, go-karting and judo.
The Leavers' Programme.
OBH organises a Leavers' Programme for the pupils that are leaving the school in the last few weeks of the summer term after their Common Entrance exams. The Programme starts with a week-long outdoor adventure trip. Afterwards the pupils enjoy two weeks of trips, events and activities. These include trips to London and the West End, talks by distinguished people, a trip to the Wimbledon Championships, concerts, a garden party and a triathlon. It culminates with a Leavers' service and barbecue followed by speech day and the end of term the next day.

Bümpliz-Oberbottigen

Bümpliz-Oberbottigen is a "Stadtteil" (district) of the city of Bern, Switzerland. It is situated to the west of the city center and consists of the "Quartiere" (quarters) Bümpliz, Oberbottigen, Stöckacker, Bethlehem and Brünnen.
As the most recently developed district of Bern, Bümpliz-Oberbottigen is an amalgamation of Bümpliz, a formerly independent suburban municipality, with rural hamlets such as Oberbottigen and Riedbach and modern highrise housing developments. The tower blocks of Gäbelbach, Tscharnergut and Stöckacker, a heritage from the 1960s and 70s, are a prominent part of Bethlehem's cityscape. The most recent quarter, Brünnen, was formally established in September 2008 as part of an ongoing major urban development programme.
Statistics.
In 2006, the district had 31,343 inhabitants, 30% of which were foreigners, mostly South Eastern European nationals. This constitutes more than a third of Bern's entire foreign population. The apartment rents are the city's lowest, and 8.8% of the population received social welfare benefits in 2006, as compared to 4.6% in the city as a whole.
With a surface area of 2,023 hectares, the district is the city's largest. It is a bedroom community, home to 25% of the city's population but only the location of 9% of the city's workplaces.
History.
The area of Bümpliz has been a center of habitation since about the 5th century BC, as indicated by the presence of La Tène and "Völkerwanderung" burial grounds, as well as the remains of an extensive 1st century Roman villa at the site of today's St. Maurce church. In medieval times and under the Ancien Régime, the dominion of Bümpliz – recorded as "Pimpenymgis" in 1016 and "Bimplitz" in 1235 – changed hands from the Empire to the lords of Bern and then numerous times among the patrician families of Bern, who built several palatial residences in Bümpliz.
The municipality of Bümpliz, founded 1798 in the course of the Napoleonic reforms, experienced a swift growth as a suburb of Bern after the 1860s. Financial difficulties forced it to agree to a merger with Bern in 1919. The new district continued to grow, in particular after 1945 with the construction of large-scale housing developments and satellite towns (Tscharnergut 1958–67, Schwabgut 1965–71, Fellergut 1961–64, Gäbelbach 1965–68 and Kleefeld 1968–72).
Ambitious plans to build a high-rise satellite city for 150,000 inhabitants had to be shelved due to the recession brought about by the 1973 oil crisis, and another plan failed in the 1990s due to the collapse of a bubble in the housing market. A much reduced development plan for the new Brünnen quarter was approved in a 1999 referendum. After lengthy court disputes, construction of the residential buildings and of the Westside shopping and leisure complex designed by Daniel Libeskind commenced in 2005. The area is planned to be fully developed in 2018.
Buildings of note.
The "Altes Schloss" (Old Palace) of Bümpliz on Bümplizstrasse 91 is built on the site of a 10th-century Upper Burgundian royal court. A round tower, whose fundaments are visible in the cellar, was built by Peter II of Savoy in the 1260s. The current palace was built after 1488 by Rudolf von Erlach in the late medieval Romantic style and was partially adapted to the tastes of the Baroque by Franz Ludwig von Erlach in 1632. The moat was filled and the palace partially demolished in 1742; a modern extension was added in 1979-80.
Very close to the Old Palace, the "Neues Schloss" (New Palace) – a singular work in Bernese architectural history – was built in 1742 by Albrecht Türler for Daniel Tschiffeli. It housed a boys' school in the 19th century and is now the civil registry office of Bern; all civil marriages in the city are officiated in the palace's richly decorated great salon.
The reformed church of Bümpliz, formerly a Roman Catholic church dedicated to St. Maurice, was rebuilt in 1666 after a fire by Abraham Dünz. It received extensions by Karl Indermühle in 1915 and 1924 as well as by Karl Indermühle in 1952. Also in Bümpliz, the Feller country estate, a 1730 construction, was reshaped in the Classicist style in the 19th century, and is now embedded in the "Fellergut" highrise housing development. In Brünnen, the former lord's estate, a 1648 construction with 1765 extension by Niklaus Sprüngli, features painted wood carvings that are among Bern's best architectural sculptures from the Louis XV period.
In the rural landscape west of Bümpliz many significant works of traditional Bernese countryside architecture remain. The hamlet of Niederbottigen is among the best-preserved such settlements, including among others the "Hochstudhaus", an 1675 farmhouse displaying exceptionally fine craftsmanship, and the "Hans-Franz-Nägeli-Haus", a 17th-century High Baroque country estate in the center of the settlement.
One of the area's first modern housing developments, the "Morgenstrasse-Siedlung" of 1943-44 in Bümpliz by Hermann Rüfenacht, is a testament to the Heimatstil-influenced wartime modern style in Switzerland. The Stapfenacker school, built 1930-31 by Karl Indermühle, is one of Switzerland's first schools in the Neues Bauen style.
The "Tscharnergut" tower blocks, built in Bethlehem in 1958-65 as a car-free satellite town for 5,000 inhabitants, were among the country's first highrise housing developments. In 1965-68, they were complemented by the "Gäbelbach" development, Bern's most architecturally prominent work of large-scale housebuilding. It consists of three immense tower blocks inspired by Le Corbusier's Unités d'Habitation linked by an axis of community buildings. Just south of Gäbelbach, the long-empty Brünnen field is currently being developed into an upmarket residential area. The new quarter's commercial and architectural centerpiece – the Westside complex by Daniel Libeskind – was opened to the public on 8 October 2008.

Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering

Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS) is a scattering technique used to study nanostructured surfaces and thin films. The scattered probe is either photons (Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, GISAXS) or neutrons (Grazing-incidence small-angle neutron scattering, GISANS). GISAS combines the accessible length scales of Small-angle scattering (SAS: SAXS or SANS) and the surface sensitivity of grazing incidence diffraction (GID).
GISAS applications.
A typical application of GISAS is the characterisation of self-assembly and self-organization on the nanoscale in thin films. Systems studied by GISAS include quantum dot arrays,
growth instabilities formed during in-situ growth,
self-organized nanostructures in thin films of block copolymers,
silica mesophases, 
and nanoparticles. 
GISAXS was introduced by Levine and Cohen to study the dewetting of gold deposited on a glass surface. The technique was further developed by Naudon and coworkers to study metal agglomerates on surfaces and in buried interfaces. With the advent of nanoscience other applications evolved quickly, first in hard matter such as the characterization of quantum dots on semiconductor surfaces and the in-situ characterization of metal deposits on oxide surfaces. This was soon to be followed by soft matter systems such as ultrathin polymer films, polymer blends, block copolymer films and other self-organized nanostructured thin films that have become indispensable for nanoscience and technology. Future challenges of GISAS may lie in biological applications, such as proteins, peptides, or viruses attached to surfaces or in lipid layers.
GISAXS interpretation.
As a hybrid technique, GISAXS combines concepts from transmission SAXS and from GID. From SAXS it uses the form factors and structure factors. From GID it uses the scattering geometry close to the critical angles of substrate and film, and the two-dimensional character of the scattering, giving rise to diffuse rods of scattering intensity perpendicular to the surface. GISAXS also shares elements of the scattering technique of diffuse reflectivity such as the Yoneda/Vinyard peak at the critical angle of the sample, and the scattering theory, the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA). However, while diffuse reflectivity remains confined to the incident plane (the plane given by the incident beam and the surface normal), GISAXS explores the whole scattering from the surface in all directions, typically utilizing an area detector. Thus GISAXS gains access to a wider range of lateral and vertical structures and, in particular, is sensitive to the morphology and preferential alignment of nanoscale objects at the surface or inside the thin film.
As a particular consequence of the DWBA, the refraction of x-rays has to be always taken into account in the case of thin film studies, due to the fact that scattering angles are small, often less than 1 deg. The refraction correction applies to the perpendicular component of the scattering vector with respect to the substrate while the parallel component is unaffected. Thus parallel scattering can often be interpreted within the kinematic theory of SAXS, while refractive corrections apply to the scattering along perpendicular cuts of the scattering image, for instance along a scattering rod.
In the interpretation of GISAXS images some complication arises in the scattering from low-Z films e.g. organic materials on silicon wafers, when the incident angle is in between the critical angles of the film and the substrate. In this case, the reflected beam from the substrate has a similar strength as the incident beam and thus the scattering from the reflected beam from the film structure can give rise to a doubling of scattering features in the perpendicular direction. This as well as interference between the scattering from the direct and the reflected beam can be fully accounted for by the DWBA scattering theory.
These complications are often more than offset by the fact that the dynamic enhancement of the scattering intensity is significant. In combination with the straightforward scattering geometry, where all relevant information is contained in a single scattering image, in-situ and real-time experiments are facilitated. Specifically self-organization during MBE growth and re-organization processes in block copolymer films under the influence of solvent vapor have been characterized on the relevant timescales ranging from seconds to minutes. Ultimately the time resolution is limited by the x-ray flux on the samples necessary to collect an image and the read-out time of the area detector.
Experimental practice.
Dedicated or partially dedicated GISAXS beamlines exist at many Synchrotron light sources (for instance APS, CHESS, ESRF, HASYLAB, NSLS, Pohang Light Source) and also Advanced Light Source at LBNL.
At neutron research facilities,
GISANS is increasingly used,
typically on small-angle (SANS) instruments or on reflectometers.
GISAS does not require any specific sample preparation other than thin film deposition techniques. Film thicknesses may range from a few nm to several 100 nm, and such thin films are still fully penetrated by the x-ray beam. The film surface, the film interior, as well as the substrate-film interface are all accessible. By varying the incidence angle the various contributions can be identified.

Manasbal Lake

Manasbal Lake is a lake located in Safapora area of Ganderbal District in the State of Jammu and Kashmir in India. The name Manasbal is said to be a derivative of the Lake Manasarovar. Lake is encircled by three villages viz., Jarokbal, Kondabal (also called Kiln place, is situated on the north-eastern side of the lake) and Ganderbal and is stated to be the deepest lake (at depth) in India. The large growth of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) at the periphery of the lake (blooms during July and August) adds to the beauty of the clear waters of the lake. The Mughal garden, called the Garoka, (meaning bay window) built by Nur Jahan overlooks the lake.
The lake is a good place for birdwatching as it is one of the largest natural stamping grounds of Aquatic birds in Kashmir and has the sobriquet of "supreme gem of all Kashmir Lakes". The rootstocks of lotus plant which grows extensively in the lake are harvested and marketed, and also eaten by the local people.
Access.
The lake is approached from Srinagar by a road via Shadipur, Nasim, Kashmir and Gandarbal. Road to Wular Lake, the largest lake in Kashmir, passes through this lake, via Safapur.
History.
It is believed to be an ancient lake by locals but exact dating is yet to be done. Close to the northern shore of the lake are the ruins of a 17th century fort, called the Darogabagh, built by the Moghuls, used in the past by caravans traveling from Punjab to Srinagar.
Topography.
The lake is surrounded by the Baladar mountains on the east, by an elevated plateau known as 'Karewa' comprising lacustrine, fluviatile and loessic deposits on the north and bounded by the Ahtung hills in the south, which are used for limestone extraction.
Along the course of the Jhelum River, the Manasbal Lake falls under the third series of high altitude lakes of the Himalayas (designated with respect to their origin, altitudinal situation and nature of biota they contain) as the valley lakes (Dal, Anchar Lake, Manasbal etc.) situated at the altitudinal zone of ; the other two types being the high altitude wetlands (altitude amsl) of the second series of lakes (Nilnag) in the lower fringes of Pir Panjal ranges right in the midst of pine forests, and the glaciated lakes of the first series situated on the inner Himalayas between amsl (Alipathar, Sheshnag, Kounsarnag, Tar Sar, Mar Sar, Vishansar, Gangbal, Kishan Sar, Kyo Tso, Pangong Tso, etc.) which have probably originated during the third Himalayan glaciation. A fissure is reported to be running from east to west at the centre of the lake.
Land use.
Important vegetation in the catchment of the lake comprise Orchards (apple, mulberry), some Platanus (Chinar trees) and Salix trees. Safar, a nearby village of Safapur which has a grove of Chinar trees, is known as Badshah Boni, royal Chinar, and was planted in imitation of the Nasim Bagh in Srinagar. Maize, mustard and wheat are generally the main crops grown in the agricultural lands of the catchment. In recent years, land use pattern has changed with more land used for horticulture and also diversion of land for construction purposes. &.
Hydrology.
The drainage basin for the lake, covering an area of , has no major inlet channels and is thus fed mainly by precipitation (rain and snow fall) and springs (more than 1,200 springs). Lake water outflows to the Jhelum River through a regulated outflow channel. The lake is the source of water for fishing and for obtaining food and fodder plants.
The lake not only provides source of water but also offers facilities for navigation and transportation, fisheries, harvesting of economically useful plants, sightseeing, tourism and recreation.
Water quality issues.
Some of the water quality parameters reported relate to:
Flora.
Within the lake water, the flora recorded comprise the following.
Fauna.
The fauna recorded in the lake are the Zooplankton, Benthos and Fish. The economically important fishes reported are:
Note:+ considered economically important
Cyprinus, an exotic species, has proliferated extensively after its introduction in 1956. A decline in the population of indigenous species due to rapid changes in the environment was reported.
Deterioration of the lake.
Eutrophication was recorded and confirmed by the test results in the lake. Ceratophyllum demersum recorded increase in the lake area. Dense mono specific stands have been created by the weeds. Further, decrease in species diversity has occurred, increase in the period of anoxic conditions and accumulation of H2S in deeper waters has been reported. Pollution has also taken place due to lack of waste water treatment plants.
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) which conducted an extensive survey of the lake in 1997 attributed the reasons for the deterioration of the lake, particularly on its banks, gradually turning it into a stinking marsh, due to the following.
WWF recommended several measures to be undertaken for the restoration of the lake.
Lake restoration works.
It was only in the year 2007 that lake restoration measures could be undertaken with the formation of Wular-Manasbal Development Authority (WMDA) under the Government of Jammu and Kashmir.
WMDA undertook the following measures for restoration and to improve the general environment of the lake.
Chief Executive Officer of the WMDA has been reported stating that:
Shikara operators of the Lake area have reported that “there has been a lot of improvement in its condition”
Hindu temple.
Wullar-Manasbal Development Authority has reported unearthing of an ancient Hindu temple, on the eastern shore of the Manasbal Lake, built in the traditional architectural style of ancient Kashmir. The lower half of the temple, which was buried in earth, was found during the restoration works undertaken for the lake. Dated to 800-900 AD, during Avantivarman or Sankaravarman rule, based on epigraphic writings, the temple, constructed in local grey stone, has a unique pyramid-shaped roof top with Corinthian or floral motifs. It is stated to be a new pilgrimage attraction for pilgrims who visit the cave shrine at Amarnath and the Kheer Bhawani temple at Tulmulla in Ganderbal district. Other tourist attractions in the lake area are the Manasbal Temple, the ruins of a terraced Mughal garden and sculptured stones of some Buddhist shrines on the banks of the lake.
Water skiing.
The weather is pleasant in the months of May and August, when the lake offers water skiing sport, which is now becoming an increasingly popular activity in many rivers and lakes in India. Jammu & Kashmir Tourism Department (JKTD) provides essential water skiing equipment and trained instructors to adventure seekers. The lake’s surface sheen and its long length and width attract tourists to water skiing sport. However, the noise and turbulences of waterskiing boats will totally change the environment of this last quiet lake and could risk to take away one of its main attractions: Peace. There is still a discussion going on whether or not a more environmentally sensitive form of sustainable tourism would be more appropriate for this special lake - to not turn it into a second Dal Lake.

Troides cuneifera

Troides cuneifera is a large butterfly belonging to the swallowtail (papilionidae) family found in the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and Borneo.
Being very similar to "Troides amphrysus", the butterfly was originally described as "Ornithoptera amphrisius" var. "cuneifera". The first to separate the two species was Pieter Cornelius Tobias Snellen in 1889. In Sumatra and Java it is a highlands species occurring up to an altitude of , but it occurs as low as in the Thai-Malay Peninsula. The species is in decline in Sumatra and Java due to human activities such as increased cultivation.
"Troides cuneifera tantalus" remains one of the great mysteries of the birdwings. The taxon is known from only one male and one female. When described, the specimens were claimed to originate from Kala Bula Hills or Kala Bala Hills, north Borneo.
Description.
Male: The fore wings are ground colour black. There are some yellow postdiscal stripes which may be faint.. The underside of the fore wings is very similar. The hind wings of are golden-yellow. The veins and the edge of the wing are black. There is a chain of post discal black spots. The underside of the hind wings is very similar.
The abdomen is light-brown and has two black spots. The underside of the abdomen is yellow. The head and thorax are black.
Female: "Troides cuneifera" is sexually dimorphic. The female is larger than the male. The wing ground colour is dark-brown. The veins are bordered by white shading. There is a golden-yellow area with dark veins on the hind wings. At the outer edge there is a marginal chain of yellow spots. The underside is very similar.

1931–32 South Africa rugby union tour

The 1931-32 South Africa tour of Britain and Ireland was a collection of friendly rugby union games undertaken by the South Africa national rugby union team against the four British Home Nation teams. The tour also took in several matches against British and Irish club, county and invitational teams. This was the fourth South Africa tour and the third tour of the Northern Hemisphere.
The tour was extremely successful for the South Africans, as the team only lost a single match. In the tests played the team beat all four home nations. The only team to beat the Springboks was the invitational East Midlands county team. The final tour record saw 26 matches played, with South Africa winning 23, losing one and drawing two.
Criticism of playing style.
Although very successful on the pitch, the touring South Africans were unloved by their hosts and the press back home. Bennie Osler, the South African captain, introduced a style of play which centered around a continual kicking game; either into touch in an attempt to support his large pack or diagonally across the pitch for his wings to chase. This was seen by many critics of the time as 10-man tactics, with the backs taken out of the match, and thus the entertainment brought by previous South African tours removed.
Welsh journalist 'Old Stager' stated "The Africans, by adherence to ten-man rugby, are winning their matches, but are not capturing the hearts and the imagination of rugby followers...". O.L. Owen in his "History of the RFU" concurred with these thoughts, "The least spectacular and, so far as back play was concerned, the most disappointing of the South African touring sides..."

The Lucy poems

The Lucy poems are a series of five poems composed by the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth (1770–1850) between 1798 and 1801. All but one were first published during 1800 in the second edition of "Lyrical Ballads", a collaboration between Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge that was both Wordsworth's first major publication and a milestone in the early English Romantic movement. In the series, Wordsworth sought to write unaffected English verse infused with abstract ideals of beauty, nature, love, longing and death.
The poems were written during a short period while the poet lived in Germany. Although they individually deal with a variety of themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.
The "Lucy poems" consist of "Strange fits of passion have I known", "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", "I travelled among unknown men", "Three years she grew in sun and shower", and "A slumber did my spirit seal". Although they are presented as a series in modern anthologies, Wordsworth did not conceive of them as a group, nor did he seek to publish the poems in sequence. He described the works as "experimental" in the prefaces to both the 1798 and 1800 editions of "Lyrical Ballads", and revised the poems significantly—shifting their thematic emphasis—between 1798 and 1799. Only after his death in 1850 did publishers and critics begin to treat the poems as a fixed group; anthologies since have generally presented them as a series.
Background.
"Lyrical Ballads".
In 1798 Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge jointly published "Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems", a collection of verses each had written separately. The book became hugely popular and was published widely; it is generally considered a herald of the Romantic movement in English literature. In it, Wordsworth aimed to use everyday language in his compositions as set out in the preface to the 1802 edition: "The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men, and at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect." 
The two poets had met three years earlier in either late August or September 1795 in Bristol. The meeting laid the foundation for an intense and profoundly creative friendship, based in part on their shared disdain for the artificial diction of the poetry of the era. Beginning in 1797, the two lived within walking distance of each other in Somerset, which solidified their friendship. Wordsworth believed that his life before meeting Coleridge was sedentary and dull, and that his poetry amounted to little. Coleridge influenced Wordsworth, and his praise and encouragement inspired Wordsworth to write prolifically. Dorothy, Wordsworth's sister, related the effect Coleridge had on her brother in a March 1798 letter: "His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did, as to the "mechanism" in original of poetry, and his ideas flow faster than he can express them." With his new inspiration, Wordsworth came to believe he could write poetry rivalling that of John Milton. He and Coleridge planned to collaborate, but never moved beyond suggestions and notes for each other.
The expiration of Wordsworth's Alfoxton House lease soon provided an opportunity for the two friends to live together. They conceived a plan to settle in Germany with Dorothy and Coleridge's wife, Sara, "to pass the two ensuing years in order to acquire the German language, and to furnish ourselves with a tolerable stock of information in natural science". In September 1798, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy travelled to Germany to explore proximate living arrangements, but this proved difficult. Although they lived together in Hamburg for a short time, the city was too expensive for their budgets. Coleridge soon found accommodations in the town of Ratzeburg in Schleswig-Holstein, which was less expensive but still socially vibrant. The impoverished Wordsworth, however, could neither afford to follow Coleridge nor provide for himself and his sister in Hamburg; the siblings instead moved to moderately priced accommodations in Goslar in Lower Saxony, Germany.
Separation from Coleridge.
Between October 1798 and February 1799, Wordsworth worked on the first draft of the "Lucy poems" together with a number of other verses, including the "Matthew poems", "Lucy Gray" and "The Prelude". Coleridge had yet to join the siblings in Germany, and Wordsworth's separation from his friend depressed him. In the three months following their parting, Wordsworth completed the first three of the "Lucy poems": "Strange fits", "She dwelt", and "A slumber". They first appeared in a letter to Coleridge dated December 1798, in which Wordsworth wrote that "She dwelt" and "Strange fits" were "little Rhyme poems which I hope will amuse you". Wordsworth characterised the two poems thus to mitigate any disappointment Coleridge might suffer in receiving these two poems instead of the promised three-part philosophical epic "The Recluse".
In the same letter, Wordsworth complained that:
Wordsworth partially blamed Dorothy for the abrupt loss of Coleridge's company. He felt that their finances—insufficient for supporting them both in Ratzeburg—would have easily supported him alone, allowing him to follow Coleridge. Wordsworth's anguish was compounded by the contrast between his life and that of his friend. Coleridge's financial means allowed him to entertain lavishly and to seek the company of nobles and intellectuals; Wordsworth's limited wealth constrained him to a quiet and modest life. Wordsworth's envy seeped into his letters when he described Coleridge and his new friends as "more favored sojourners" who may "be chattering and chatter'd to, through the whole day".
Although Wordsworth sought emotional support from his sister, their relationship remained strained throughout their time in Germany. Separated from his friend and forced to live in the sole company of his sister, Wordsworth used the "Lucy poems" as an emotional outlet.
Identity of Lucy.
Wordsworth did not reveal the inspiration for the character of Lucy, and over the years the topic has generated intense speculation among literary historians. Little biographical information can be drawn from the poems—it is difficult even to determine Lucy's age. In the mid-19th century, Thomas DeQuincey (1785–1859), author and one-time friend of Wordsworth, wrote that the poet "always preserved a mysterious silence on the subject of that 'Lucy', repeatedly alluded to or apostrophised in his poems, and I have heard, from gossiping people about Hawkshead, some snatches of tragic story, which, after all, might be an idle semi-fable, improved out of slight materials."
Critic Herbert Hartman believes Lucy's name was taken from "a neo-Arcadian commonplace", and argues she was not intended to represent any single person. In the view of one Wordsworth biographer, Mary Moorman (1906–1994), "The identity of 'Lucy' has been the problem of critics for many years. But Wordsworth is a poet before he is a biographer, and neither 'Lucy' nor her home nor his relations with her are necessarily in the strict sense historical. Nevertheless, as the "Lyrical Ballads" were all of them 'founded on fact' in some way, and as Wordsworth's mind was essentially factual, it would be rash to say that Lucy is entirely fictitious."
Moorman suggests that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders why she would be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It is more likely that Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.
In 1980, Hunter Davies contended that the series was written for the poet's sister Dorothy, but found the Lucy–Dorothy allusion "bizarre". Earlier, literary critic Richard Matlak tried to explain the Lucy–Dorothy connection, and wrote that Dorothy represented a financial burden to Wordsworth, which had effectively forced his separation from Coleridge. Wordsworth, depressed over the separation from his friend, in this interpretation, expresses both his love for his sister and fantasies about her loss through the poems. Throughout the poems, the narrator's mixture of mourning and antipathy is accompanied by denial and guilt; his denial of the Lucy–Dorothy relationship and the lack of narratorial responsibility for the death of Lucy allow him to escape from questioning his desires for the death of his sister. After Wordsworth began the "Lucy poems", Coleridge wrote, "Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph / whether it had any reality, I cannot say. —Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his Sister might die." It is, however, possible that Wordsworth simply feared her death and did not wish it, even subconsciously.
Reflecting on the significance and relevance of Lucy's identity, the 19th-century poet, essayist and literary critic Frederic Myers (1843–1901) observed that:
Literary scholar Karl Kroeber (1926–2009) argues that Lucy "possesses a double existence; her actual, historical existence and her idealised existence in the poet's mind. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant only insofar as it makes manifest the significance implicit in the actual girl." Hartman holds the same view; to him Lucy is seen "entirely from within the poet, so that this modality may be the poet's own", but then he argues, "she belongs to the category of spirits who must still become human ... the poet describes her as dying at a point at which she would have been humanized." The literary historian Kenneth Johnston concludes that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth's muse, and the group as a whole "is a series of invocations to a Muse feared dead. As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate word to describe them, but breathlessly, almost aware of what such a loss would mean to the speaker: 'oh, the difference to me!'" 
Scholar John Mahoney observes that whether Lucy is intended to represent Dorothy, Mary or another is much less important to understanding the poems than the fact that she represented "a hidden being who seems to lack flaws and is alone in the world." Furthermore, she is represented as being insignificant in the public sphere but of the utmost importance in the private sphere; in "She dwelt" this manifests through the comparison of Lucy to both a hidden flower and a shining star. Neither Lucy nor Wordsworth's other female characters "exist as independent self-conscious human beings with minds as capable of the poet's" and are "rarely allowed to speak for themselves."
The poems.
The "Lucy poems" are written from the point of view of a lover who has long viewed the object of his affection from afar, and who is now affected by her death. Yet Wordsworth structured the poems so that they are not about any one person who has died; instead they were written about a figure representing the poet's lost inspiration. Lucy is Wordsworth's inspiration, and the poems as a whole are, according to Wordsworth biographer Kenneth Johnston, "invocations to a Muse feared dead". Lucy is represented in all five poems as sexless; it is unlikely that the poet ever realistically saw her as a possible lover. Instead, she is presented as an ideal and represents Wordsworth's frustration at his separation from Coleridge; the asexual imagery reflects the futility of his longing.
Wordsworth's voice slowly disappears from the poems as they progress, and his voice is entirely absent from the fifth poem. His love operates on the subconscious level, and he relates to Lucy more as a spirit of nature than as a human being. The poet's grief is private, and he is unable to fully explain its source. When Lucy's lover is present, he is completely immersed in human interactions and the human aspects of nature, and the death of his beloved is a total loss for the lover. The 20th-century critic Spencer Hall argues that the poet represents a "fragile kind of humanism".
"Strange fits of passion have I known".
"Strange fits" is probably the earliest of the poems and revolves around a fantasy of Lucy's death. It describes the narrator's journey to Lucy's cottage and his thoughts along the way. Throughout, the motion of the moon is set in opposition to the motion of the speaker. The poem contains seven stanzas, a relatively elaborate structure which underscores his ambivalent attitude towards Lucy's imagined death. The constant shifts in perspective and mood reflect his conflicting emotions. The first stanza, with its use of dramatic phrases such as "fits of passion" and "dare to tell", contrasts with the subdued tone of the rest of the poem. As a lyrical ballad, "Strange fits" differs from the traditional ballad form, which emphasises abnormal action, and instead focuses on mood.
The presence of death is felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, a symbol of the beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays a significant role in the action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 17–20). 
The narrator's conscious presence is wholly absent from the next stanza, which moves forward in what literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman describes as a "motion approaching yet never quite attaining its end". When the moon abruptly drops behind the cottage, the narrator snaps out of his dream, and his thoughts turn towards death. Lucy, the beloved, is united with the landscape in death, while the image of the retreating, entrancing moon is used to portray the idea of looking beyond one's lover. The darker possibility also remains that the dream state represents the fulfilment of the lover's fantasy through the death of the beloved. In falling asleep while approaching his beloved's home, the lover betrays his own reluctance to be with Lucy.
Wordsworth made numerous revisions to each of the "Lucy poems". The earliest version of "Strange fits" appears in a December 1798 letter from Dorothy to Coleridge. This draft contains many differences in phrasing and does not include a stanza that appeared in the final published version. The new lines direct the narrative towards "the Lover's ear alone", implying that only other lovers can understand the relationship between the moon, the beloved and the beloved's death. Wordsworth also removed from the final stanza the lines:
<poem style="margin-left:20px">I told her this; her laughter light
Is ringing in my ears;
And when I think upon that night
My eyes are dim with tears.</poem>
This final stanza lost its significance with the completion of the later poems in the series, and the revision allowed for a sense of anticipation at the poem's close and helped draw the audience into the story of the remaining "Lucy poems". Of the other changes, only the description of the horse's movement is important: "My horse trudg'd on" becomes "With quickening pace my horse drew nigh", which heightens the narrator's vulnerability to fantasies and dreams in the revised version.
"She dwelt among the untrodden ways".
"She dwelt among the untrodden ways" presents Lucy as having lived in solitude near the source of the River Dove. According to literary critic Geoffrey Durrant, the poem charts her "growth, perfection, and death". To convey the dignified, unaffected naturalness of his subject, Wordsworth uses simple language, mostly words of one syllable. In the opening quatrain, he describes the isolated and untouched area where Lucy lived, as well as her innocence and beauty, which he compares to that of a hidden flower in the second. The poem begins in a descriptive rather than narrative manner, and it is not until the line "When Lucy ceased to be" that the reader is made aware that the subject of the verse has died. Literary scholar Mark Jones describes this effect as finding the poem is "over before it has begun", while according to writer Margaret Oliphant (1828–1897), Lucy "is dead before we so much as heard of her".
Lucy's "untrodden ways" are symbolic of both her physical isolation and the unknown details of her thoughts and life. The third quatrain is written with an economy intended to capture the simplicity the narrator sees in Lucy. Her femininity is described in girlish terms. This has drawn criticism from those who see the female icon, in the words of literary scholar John Woolford, "represented in Lucy by condemning her to death while denying her the actual or symbolic fulfillment of maternity". To evoke the "loveliness of body and spirit", a pair of complementary but paradoxical images are employed in the second stanza: the solitary, hidden violet juxtaposed to the publicly visible Venus, emblem of love and first star of evening. Wondering if Lucy more resembles the violet or the star, the critic Cleanth Brooks (1906–1994) concludes that while Wordsworth likely views her as "the single star, completely dominating world, not arrogantly like the sun, but sweetly and modestly", the metaphor is a conventional compliment with only vague relevance. For Wordsworth, Lucy's appeal is closer to the violet and lies in her seclusion and her perceived affinity with nature.
Wordsworth acquired a copy of the antiquarian and churchman Thomas Percy's (1729–1811) collection of British ballads "Reliques of Ancient English Poetry" (1765) in Hamburg a few months before he began to compose the series. The influence of the traditional English folk ballad is evident in the metre, rhythm and structure of "She dwelt". It follows the variant ballad stanza a4–b3–a4–b3, and in keeping with ballad tradition tells a dramatic story. As Durrant observed, "To confuse the mode of the 'Lucy' poems with that of the love lyric is to overlook their structure, in which, as in the traditional ballad, a story is told as boldly and briefly as possible." Kenneth and Warren Ober compare the opening lines of "She dwelt" to the traditional ballad "Katharine Jaffray" and note similarities in rhythm and structure, as well as in theme and imagery:
The narrator of the poem is less concerned with the experience of observing Lucy than with his reflections and meditations on his observations. Throughout the poem sadness and ecstasy are intertwined, a fact emphasised by the exclamation marks in the second and third verses. The critic Carl Woodring writes that "She dwelt" and the Lucy series can be read as elegiac, as "sober meditationon death". He found that they have "the economy and the general air of epitaphs in the Greek Anthology... [If all elegies are mitigations of death, the Lucy poems are also meditations on simple beauty, by distance made more sweet and by death preserved in distance".
An early draft of "She dwelt" contained two stanzas which had been omitted from the first edition. The revisions exclude many of the images but emphasise the grief that the narrator experienced. The original version began with floral imagery, which was later cut:
<poem style="margin-left:20px">My hope was one, from cities far,
Nursed on a lonesome heath;
Her lips were red as roses are,
Her hair a woodbine wreath.
</poem>
A fourth stanza, also later removed, included an explanation of how Lucy was to die: "But slow distemper checked her bloom / And on the Heath she died."
"I travelled among unknown men".
The last of the "Lucy poems" to be composed, "I travelled among unknown men", was the only one not included in the second edition of "Lyrical Ballads". Although Wordsworth claimed that the poem was composed while he was still in Germany, it was in fact written during April 1801. Evidence for this later date comes from a letter Wordsworth wrote to Mary Hutchinson referring to "I travelled" as a newly created poem. In 1802, he instructed his printer to place "I travelled" immediately after "A slumber did my spirit seal" in "Lyrical Ballads", but the poem was omitted. It was later published in "Poems, in Two Volumes" in 1807.
The poem has frequently been read as a declaration of Wordsworth's love for his native England and his determination not to live abroad again:
<poem style="margin-left:20px">
'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for still I seem
To love thee more and more. (lines 5–8)
</poem>
The first two stanzas seem to speak of the poet's personal experience, and a patriotic reading would reflect his appreciation and pride for the English landscape. The possibility remains, however, that Wordsworth is referring to England as a physical rather than a political entity, an interpretation that gains strength from the poem's connections to the other "Lucy poems". 
Lucy only appears in the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in mourning for her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.
Although "I travelled" was written two years after the other poems in the series, it echoes the earlier verses in both tone and language. Wordsworth gives no hint as to the identity of Lucy, and although he stated in the preface to "Lyrical Ballads" that all the poems were "founded on fact", knowing the basis for the character of Lucy is not necessary to appreciating the poem and understanding its sentiment. Similarly, no insight can be gained from determining the exact geographical location of the "springs of Dove"; in his youth, Wordsworth had visited springs of that name in Derbyshire, Patterdale and Yorkshire.
"Three years she grew in sun and shower".
"Three years she grew in sun and shower" was composed between 6 October and 28 December 1798. The poem depicts the relationship between Lucy and nature through a complex opposition of images. Antithetical couplings of words—"sun and shower", "law and impulse", "earth and heaven", "kindle and restrain"—are used to evoke the opposing forces inherent in nature. A conflict between nature and humanity is described, as each attempts to possess Lucy. The poem contains both epithalamic and elegiac characteristics; Lucy is shown as wedded to nature, while her human lover is left alone to mourn in the knowledge that death has separated her from humanity.
"A slumber did my spirit seal".
Written in spare language, "A slumber did my spirit seal" consists of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, soporific movement in which figurative language conveys the nebulous image of a girl who "seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years". The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation from the fact that she is now beyond life's trials, and "at last ... in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures". The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.
Grouping as a series.
Although the "Lucy poems" share stylistic and thematic similarities, it was not Wordsworth but literary critics who first presented the five poems as a unified set called the "Lucy poems". The grouping was originally suggested by critic Thomas Powell in 1831 and later advocated by Margaret Oliphant in an 1871 essay. The 1861 "Golden Treasury", compiled by the English historian Francis Palgrave (1788–1861), groups only four of the verses, omitting "Strange fits". The poems next appeared as a complete set of five in the collection of Wordsworth's poems by English poet and critic Matthew Arnold (1822–1888).
The grouping and sequence of the "Lucy poems" has been a matter of debate in literary circles. Various critics have sought to add poems to the group; among those proposed over the years are "Alcaeus to Sappho", "Among all lovely things", "Lucy Gray", "Surprised by joy", "Tis said, that some have died for love", "Louisa", "Nutting", "Presentiments", "She was a Phantom of delight", "The Danish Boy", "The Two April Mornings", "To a Young Lady", and "Written in Very Early Youth". None of the proposals have met with widespread acceptance. The five poems included in the Lucy "canon" focus on similar themes of nature, beauty, separation and loss, and most follow the same basic ballad form. Literary scholar Mark Jones offers a general characterisation of a Lucy poem as "an untitled lyrical ballad that either mentions Lucy or is always placed with another poem that does, that either explicitly mentions her death or is susceptible of such a reading, and that is spoken by Lucy's lover."
With the exception of "A slumber", all of the poems mention Lucy by name. The decision to include this work is based in part on Wordsworth's decision to place it in close proximity to "Strange fits" and directly after "She dwelt" within "Lyrical Ballads". In addition, "I travelled" was sent to the poet's childhood friend and later wife, Mary Hutchinson, with a note that said it should be "read after 'She dwelt'". Coleridge biographer J. Dykes Campbell records that Wordsworth instructed "I travelled" to be included directly following "A slumber", an arrangement that indicates a connection between the poems. Nevertheless, the question of inclusion is further complicated by Wordsworth's eventual retraction of these instructions and his omission of "I travelled" from the two subsequent editions of "Lyrical Ballads".
The 1815 edition of "Lyrical Ballads" organised the poems into the "Poems Founded on the Affections" ("Strange fits", "She dwelt", and "I travelled") and "Poems of the Imagination" ("Three years she grew" and "A slumber"). This arrangement allowed the two dream-based poems ("Strange fits" and "A slumber") to frame the series and to represent the speaker's different sets of experiences over the course of the longer narrative. In terms of chronology, "I travelled" was written last, and thus also served as a symbolic conclusion—both emotionally and thematically—to the "Lucy poems".
Interpretation.
The series is generally considered to examine two broad themes.
Nature.
According to critic Norman Lacey, Wordsworth built his reputation as a "poet of nature". Early works, such as "Tintern Abbey", can be viewed as odes to his experience of nature. His poems can also be seen as lyrical meditations on the fundamental character of the natural world. Wordsworth said that, as a youth, nature stirred "an appetite, a feeling and a love", but by the time he wrote "Lyrical Ballads", it evoked "the still sad music of humanity".
The five "Lucy poems" are often interpreted as representing Wordsworth's opposing views of nature as well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature. For example, Lucy can be seen as a connection between humanity and nature, as a "boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She reminds us of the traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence." Although the poems evoke a sense of loss, they also hint at the completeness of Lucy's life—she was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others. She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer David Ferry (b. 1924), "not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature", while "her death was right, after all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby".
Cleanth Brooks writes that "Strange fits" presents "Kind Nature's gentlest boon", "Three years" its duality, and "A slumber" the clutter of natural object. Other scholars see "She dwelt", along with "I travelled", as representing nature's "rustication and disappearance". Mahoney views "Three years" as describing a masculine, benevolent nature similar to a creator deity. Although nature shapes Lucy over time and she is seen as part of nature herself, the poem shifts abruptly when she dies. Lucy appears to be eternal, like nature itself. Regardless, she becomes part of the surrounding landscape in life, and her death only verifies this connection.
The series presents nature as a force by turns benevolent and malign. It is shown at times to be oblivious to and uninterested in the safety of humanity. Hall argues, "In all of these poems, nature would seem to betray the heart that loves her". The imagery used to evoke these notions serves to separate Lucy from everyday reality. The literary theorist Frances Ferguson (b. 1947) notes that the "flower similes and metaphors become impediments rather than aids to any imaginative visualization of a woman; the flowers do not simply locate themselves in Lucy's cheeks, they expand to absorb the whole of her ... The act of describing seems to have lost touch with its goal—description of Lucy."
Death.
The poems Wordsworth wrote while in Goslar focus on the dead and dying. The "Lucy poems" follow this trend, and often fail to delineate the difference between life and death. Each creates an ambiguity between the sublime and nothingness, as they attempt to reconcile the question of how to convey the death of a girl intimately connected to nature. They describe a rite of passage from innocent childhood to corrupted maturity and, according to Hartman, "center on a death or a radical change of consciousness which is expressed in semi-mythical form; and they are, in fact, Wordsworth's nearest approach to a personal myth." The narrator is affected greatly by Lucy's death and cries out in "She dwelt" of "the difference to me!". Yet in "A slumber" he is spared from trauma by sleep.
The reader's experience of Lucy is filtered through the narrator's perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar H. W. Garrod (1878–1960), "The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all." Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places ... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version of the death of Pan, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline."
Critical assessment.
The first mention of the poems came from Dorothy, in a letter sent to Coleridge in December 1798. Of "Strange fits", she wrote, " next poem is a favorite of mine—i.e. of me Dorothy—". The first recorded mention of any of the "Lucy poems" (outside of notes by either William or Dorothy) occurred after the April 1799 death of Coleridge's son Berkeley. Coleridge was then living in Germany, and received the news through a letter from his friend Thomas Poole, who in his condolences mentioned Wordsworth's "A slumber":
Later, the essayist Charles Lamb (1775–1834) wrote to Wordsworth in 1801 to say that "She dwelt" was one of his favourites from "Lyrical Ballads". Likewise Romantic poet John Keats (1795–1821) praised the poem. To the diarist and writer Henry Crabb Robinson (1775–1867), "She dwelt" gave "the powerful effect of the loss of a very obscure object upon one tenderly attached to it—the opposition between the apparent strength of the passion and the insignificance of the object is delightfully conceived."
Besides word of mouth and opinions in letters, there were only a few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of "Lyrical Ballads", described "Strange fits" and "She dwelt" as "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of "Poems in Two Volumes" in 1807 had a less positive opinion about "I travell'd": "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in "Strange fits", "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" On "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about."
Many Victorian critics appreciated the emotion of the "Lucy poems" and focused on "Strange fits". John Wilson, a personal friend of both Wordsworth and Coleridge, described the poem in 1842 as "powerfully pathetic". In 1849, critic Rev. Francis Jacox, writing under the pseudonym "Parson Frank", remarked that "Strange fits" contained "true pathos. We are moved to our soul's centre by sorrow expressed as that is; for, without periphrasis or wordy anguish, without circumlocution of officious and obtrusive, and therefore, artificial grief; the mourner gives sorrow words... But he does it in words as few as may be: how intense their beauty!" A few years later, John Wright, an early Wordsworth commentator, described the contemporary perception that "Strange fits" had a "deep but subdued and 'silent fervour'". Other reviewers emphasised the importance of "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", including Scottish writer William Angus Knight (1836–1916), when he described the poem as an "incomparable twelve lines".
At the beginning of the 20th century, literary critic David Rannie praised the poems as a whole: "that strange little lovely group, which breathe a passion unfamiliar to Wordsworth, and about which he—so ready to talk about the genesis of his poems—has told us nothing [...] Let a poet keep some of his secrets: we need not grudge him the privacy when the poetry is as beautiful as this; when there is such celebration of girlhood, love, and death [...] The poet's sense of loss is sublime in its utter simplicity. He finds harmony rather than harshness in the contrast between the illusion of love and the fact of death." Later critics focused on the importance of the poems to Wordsworth's poetic technique. Durrant argued that "The four 'Lucy' poems which appeared in the 1800 edition of "Lyrical Ballads" are worth careful attention, because they represent the clearest examples of the success of Wordsworth's experiment." Alan Grob (1932–2007) focused less on the unity that the poems represent and believed that "the principal importance of the 'Matthew' and 'Lucy' poems, apart from their intrinsic achievement, substantial as that is, is in suggesting the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth's thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply."
Later critics de-emphasised the significance of the poems in Wordsworth's artistic development. Hunter Davies (b. 1936) concluded that their impact relies more on their popularity than importance to Wordsworth's poetic career. Davies went on to claim, "The poems about Lucy are perhaps Wordsworth's best-known work which he did in Germany, along with 'Nutting' and the Matthew poems, but the most "important" work was the beginning of "The Prelude"" (emphasis in original). Some critics emphasised the importance behind Lucy as a figure, including Geoffrey Hartman (b. 1929), when he claimed, "It is in the Lucy poems that the notion of spirit of place, and particularly English spirit of place, reaches its purest form." Writer and poet Meena Alexander (b. 1951) believed that the character of Lucy "is the impossible object of the poet's desire, an iconic representation of the Romantic feminine."
Parodies and allusions.
The "Lucy poems" have been parodied numerous times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned the way many 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a "meta-critical" manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism. Among the more notable is the one by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son Hartley Coleridge (1796–1849), called "On William Wordsworth" or simply "Imitation", as in the 1827 version published for "The Inspector" magazine ("He lived amidst th' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read" lines 1–4). Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author Samuel Butler (1835–1902). Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase "the difference to me!" was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was "most careful not to explain the nature of the difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead ... but he has not said this." Not every work referring to the "Lucy poems" is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist Mary Shelley (1797–1851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.

List of iPod models

[[File:iphone-comparison.png|thumb|right|Size comparison, from top to bottom, between:<br>
- a first generation iPod Nano<br>
- a first generation iPhone<br>
- a fourth generation iPod Classic]]
The Apple iPod line has been upgraded many times, and each significant revision is called a "generation". Only the most recent generation and refurbished units of previous generations of the iPod line are available from Apple for each model (classic, nano, shuffle, touch). Each new generation usually has more features and refinements while typically being physically smaller and lighter than its predecessor, while usually (but not always) retaining the older model's price tag. Notable changes include the touch-sensitive click wheel replacing the mechanical scroll wheel, use of color displays, and flash memory replacing hard disks.
Models.
The software bundled with the first generation iPod was Macintosh-only, so Windows users had to use third-party software like ephPod or XPlay to manage their music. When Apple introduced the second generation of iPods in July 2002, they sold two versions, one that included iTunes for Macintosh users and another that included Musicmatch Jukebox for Windows users. In October 2003, Apple released the Windows version of iTunes, and started selling iPods that included both Macintosh and Windows versions of iTunes so that they could be used with either platform. Current iPods no longer ship with iTunes, which must be downloaded from Apple's website.
In December 2004, Apple unveiled its first limited edition iPods, with either Madonna’s, Tony Hawk’s, or Beck’s signature or No Doubt's band logo engraved on the back for an extra US$50. On 26 October 2004, Apple introduced a special edition of its fourth generation monochrome iPod, designed in the color scheme of the album "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" by Irish rock band U2. It had a black case with a red click wheel and the back had the engraved signatures of U2's band members. This iPod was updated alongside the iPod Photo and fifth generation iPod.
On October 31, 2012, Apple released a special edition 4 GB red iPod nano as part of the Product Red campaign. An 8 GB version was released three weeks later and both of them sold for the same price as the standard models. US$10 from each sale is donated to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis & Malaria. On September 5, 2007, Apple also added a Product Red iPod Shuffle model. They did not disclose how much will be donated to charity from this model. Apple also released Special Edition Harry Potter iPods to accompany the iPod Photo. These were engraved with the Hogwarts Crest on the back and were only available to purchasers of the "Harry Potter" audiobooks. They were updated when the fifth generation iPods were released, but were only available for a limited time.

Middendorf's

Middendorf's, also known as Middendorf, is a famous Louisiana seafood restaurant and a local institution.
History.
Middendorf's was opened in 1934 during the Great Depression by a German couple named Josie and Louis Middendorf. The restaurant was passed down through two generations of the family. In September 2006, a year after Hurricane Katrina, the Lamonte family, the then second generation owners, sold the restaurant to German born chef, Horst Pfeifer, and his wife, Karen. The Pfeifers had just lost their five star New Orleans restaurant, Bella Luna, to the winds from the hurricane and from subsequent looting. Since purchasing the restaurant, the Pfeiefers have preserved the traditional menu, which includes a mixture of three distinct cuisines: Creole, Cajun, and Southern. Its most famous dish is the thin fried catfish, which "Southern Living" magazine has declared, "Possibly the best fried fish in the world."
The restaurant has been referenced in popular novels, including "The Sweet Potato Queen's Big-Ass Cookbook and Financial Planner" and Carl Hiaasen's "Double Whammy".
Location.
Middendorf's is located 40 miles northwest of New Orleans near Manchac. To the south of Middendorf's is Pass Manchac, a seven-mile-long serpentining natural canal that connects lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain. On the north side is the Amite River. The two lakes and two rivers form the boundaries for the hourglass-shaped island named Jones Island. Jones Island is a depleted cypress swamp, whose cypress trees were harvested by loggers from 1897 to 1952.
Hurricane Ike.
Middendorf's received little damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. On September 14, 2008, however, Hurricane Ike caused a ten foot storm surge on the western shores of Lake Pontchartrain. This high surge was the result of Ike's extremely large wind field and the persistent east-southeast winds that drove water into Pass Manchac. The hurricane was never within 200 miles of the area, yet this was the highest storm surge since the Hurricane of 1915, which destroyed the logging settlements of Frenier and Ruddock along the western shores of Lake Pontchartrain. At the water's highest point, four feet of water inundated the old restaurant. 
As a result of the flooding, the future of the old building is uncertain. The newer building reopened for the first time since the flood on October 8, 2008.
In 2009, the restaurant sponsored a 10 mile and 5-K race called Middendorf's Manchac Race for the first time. Runners ran along old Highway 51. In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac brought flooding and damage to the restaurant, which once again suffered the wrath of the elements.

Elizabeth de Badlesmere, Countess of Northampton

Elizabeth de Badlesmere, Countess of Northampton (1313 – 8 June 1356) was the wife of two English noblemen, Sir Edmund Mortimer and William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton. She was a co-heiress of her brother Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere.
At the age of eight she was sent to the Tower of London along with her mother, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere and her four siblings after the former maltreated Queen consort Isabella by ordering an assault upon her and refusing her admittance to Leeds Castle.
Family.
Elizabeth was born at Castle Badlesmere, Kent, England in 1313 to Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere and Margaret de Clare. She was the third of four daughters. She had one younger brother, Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere, who married Elizabeth Montagu, but did not have any children.
Her paternal grandparents were Guncelin de Badlesmere and Joan FitzBernard, and her maternal grandparents were Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond and Juliana FitzGerald of Offaly.
Elizabeth's father was hanged, drawn and quartered on 14 April 1322 for having participated in the Earl of Lancaster's rebellion against King Edward II of England; and her mother imprisoned in the Tower of London until 3 November 1322. She had been arrested the previous October for ordering an assault upon Queen consort Isabella after refusing her admittance to Leeds Castle, where Baron Badlesmere held the post of Governor. Elizabeth and her siblings were also sent to the Tower along with their mother. She was eight years old at the time and had been married for five years to her first husband; although the marriage had not yet been consummated due to her young age.
In 1328, Elizabeth's brother Giles obtained a reversal of his father's attainder, and he succeeded to the barony as the 2nd Baron Badlesmere. Elizabeth, along with her three sisters, was a co-heiress of Giles, who had no children by his wife. Upon his death in 1338, the barony fell into abeyance. The Badlesmere estates were divided among the four sisters, and Elizabeth's share included the manors of Drayton in Sussex, Kingston and Erith in Kent, a portion of Finmere in Oxfordshire as well as property in London.
Marriages and issue.
On 27 June 1316, when she was just three years old, Elizabeth married her first husband Sir Edmund Mortimer (died 16 December 1331) eldest son and heir of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March and Joan de Geneville. The marriage contract was made on 9 May 1316, and the particulars of the arrangement between her father and prospective father-in-law are described in Welsh historian R. R. Davies' "Lords and Lordship in the British Isles in the late Middle Ages". Lord Badlesmere paid Roger Mortimer the sum of £2000, and in return Mortimer endowed Elizabeth with five rich manors for life and the reversion of other lands. The marriage, which was not consummated until many years afterward, produced two sons:
By the order of King Edward III, Elizabeth's father-in-law, the Earl of Mortimer was hanged in November 1330 for having assumed royal power, along with other crimes. His estates were forfeited to the Crown, therefore Elizabeth's husband did not succeed to the earldom and died a year later. Elizabeth's dower included the estates of Maelienydd and Comot Deuddwr in the Welsh Marches. 
In 1335, just over three years after the death of Edmund Mortimer, Elizabeth married secondly William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton (1312–1360), fifth son of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan. He was a renowned military commander and diplomat. Their marriage was arranged to end the mutual hostility which had existed between the Bohun and Mortimer families. A papal dispensation was required for their marriage as de Bohun and her first husband, Sir Edmund Mortimer were related in the third and fourth degrees of consanguinity by dint of their common descent from Enguerrand de Fiennes, Seigneur de Fiennes. Elizabeth and de Bohun received some Mortimer estates upon their marriage. 
By her second marriage, Elizabeth had two more children:
In 1348, the earldom of March was restored to her eldest son Roger who succeeded as the 2nd Earl.
Death.
Elizabeth de Badlesmere died on 8 June 1356, aged about forty-three years old. She was buried in Black Friars Priory, London. She left a will dated 31 May 1356, requesting burial at the priory. Mention of Elizabeth's burial is found in the records (written in Latin) of Walden Abbey which confirm that she was buried in Black Friars:
"Anno Domini MCCCIxx.obiit Willielmus de Boun, Comes Northamptoniae, cujus corpus sepelitur in paret boreali presbyterii nostri. Et Elizabetha uxor ejus sepelitur Lundoniae in ecclesia fratrum praedictorum ante major altare".

John Gell (Royal Navy officer)

Admiral John Gell (1740–1806) was from the Gell and Eyre families of Hopton Hall in Derbyshire. He served with the Royal Navy, fighting in India and taking part in the occupation of Toulon.
Gell was a commander in the Royal Navy for over
thirty years starting in 1762 following two years as a lieutenant. He was promoted to the
rank of Admiral in 1799 after completing duties in Nova Scotia, Portugal, Genoa, the
East Indies and Toulon.
In 1793, Gell's squadron captured a Spanish ship which contained two million dollars and packages valued at over 200,000 pounds.
Biography.
Gell was born in 1740 to another John Gell of Hopton Hall. His father was born John Eyre but had taken the name Gell when he inherited the Gell fortune. Although his father had assumed the name Gell, this Gell was the great Grandson of the parliamentarian soldier, the first baronet, Sir John Gell The children of his elder brother, Philip Gell of Hopton Hall were mentioned in Gell's will.
Midshipman.
The first known reference to Gell's career is when he joins HMS "Prince" in 1757 and was promoted to Lieutenant on board HMS "Conqueror" in 1760 which was to be wrecked the same year.
Captain Gell.
In 1776 he was appointed captain of the three year old HMS "Thetis". With this ship he served in the American, The Mediterranean and the Channel Fleets until he was given command of the "Monarca". This ship was unusual in that it had been built in 1756 and for the first 24 years it had been part of the Spanish Navy before being captured by the British at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in 1780. Gell who was under the orders of Sir Samuel Hood to go to the West Indies. However the ship lost its mast in a storm and was obliged to return to Britain for refitting.
Gell was off the Indian coast during Sir Edward Hughes' five actions against the French admiral Bailli de Suffren when Gell was in command of the 68 gun
HMS "Monarca".
Gell and the "Monarca" did take part in the Battle of Cuddalore in 20 June 1783. The battle was the last of the American Revolutionary War between a rival French and British fleet. The battle which took place off the coast of India near Cuddalore was inconclusive and was remarkable in that peace had already been signed in Europe, but the news had not been heard in Asia. The 200 or so soldiers killed were lost to a war already abandoned.
Gell returned to Europe in 1784 and received no command until 1790 when he was appointed to his last captaincy, of HMS "Excellent".
Admiral Gell.
On 1 February 1793 he was appointed to be an Rear Admiral of the Blue, and raised his flag on HMS "St George". The "St George" was under the command of Captain Foley, later Sir Thomas Foley and "Hero of the Nile". Whilst in the Mediterranean with his division of the fleet, he was able to seize a French Privateer and its Spanish registered prize the "St Jago". These ships were said to be one of the most valuable prizes ever brought to England. The prize was said to contain two million dollars and packages to the value of 200,000 to 300,000 pounds. The capture of this ship and its condemnation as a prize of war (rather than being returned to its Spanish owners) was said to be one of the causes for the subsequent war with Spain.
The ownership of the Spanish ship was a matter of some debate and was not settled until 4 February 1795 when the value of the cargo was put at £935,000. At this time all the crew, captains, officers and admirals could expect to share in this prize, but it was Gell who had commanded the squadron. Admiral Lord Hood's share was £50,000. The ships that conveyed her to Portsmouth were the St George, HMS Egmont, HMS Edgar, HMS Ganges and HMS Phaeton.
In October 1793 his division of the fleet was able to obtain the surrender of a French frigate, the "Modeste" which had abused the neutrality of the port of Genoa. The battle was small and resulted in the death of one Frenchman from musket fire. The authorities at Genoa approved that the "Modeste" was taken as a spoil of war. After this he had to return to England for the last time due to ill health. The capture of the "Modeste" was to have repercussions as again in 1794 the crew of the merchant ship "Betty" were murdered by French forces.
Hughes commissioned Gell's portrait from Sir Joshua Reynolds. He bequeathed the picture to Sir Hugh Palliser who gave the painting to the Greenwich Hospital only a few years later on his death in 1796. Gell was also involved in Hood's occupation on Toulon.
Gell also sat for a portrait in 1785 when he completed his captaincy of the "Monarca". This time the portrait was full length and by the visiting American painter, Gilbert Stuart. Stuart was attempting only his second full length portrait under the guidance of Sir Joshua Reynolds.
Retirement and legacy.
Despite taking no further commands, Gell was able to make his way to be an Admiral of the White as naval promotions were strictly by seniority as superiors either died or were moved aside.
In 1800 Gell was treated to an honour where his name was chosen by the Kymin Club to be among sixteen British Admirals to have their names and victories recorded on a special naval monument. The Kymin Club was a dining club presided over by the Duke of Beaufort who had built a special round house on Kymin Hill east of Monmouth. At the end of the eighteenth century they arranged for a naval monument to be built to honour the sixteen admirals and the second anniversary of the Battle of the Nile.
When Gell died in 1806 at his home in Crickhowell in South Wales, he had left no wife or children who might have inherited the Gell's holdings in Derbyshire. He left over four thousand pounds to his sisters, friends and to Philip Gell's children. His nephew Sir William Gell was a noted archaeologist.

Another City, Not My Own

Another City, Not My Own is a 1997 novel by Dominick Dunne. The roman à clef, subtitled "A Novel in the Form of a Memoir", was inspired by Dunne's experiences in Los Angeles while covering the O.J. Simpson murder trial for "Vanity Fair".
The hardcover edition (ISBN 0-609-60100-8) was released by Crown Publishers. The paperback (ISBN 0-517-3613-96) was published by Random House in February 1999.
Plot synopsis.
Protagonist Gus Bailey, introduced in Dunne's earlier novel "People Like Us", is a successful writer who is assigned to cover the Simpson trial for "Vanity Fair". He firmly believes Simpson is guilty from the very beginning, and in his monthly column "Letter from Los Angeles", he clearly states his position and puts his personal spin on what he observes in the courtroom and beyond. Those involved with the criminal proceedings, including Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden for the prosecution, Johnnie Cochran, F. Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Barry Scheck, and Robert Shapiro for the defense, and Judge Lance Ito, all figure prominently in the story. 
Bailey becomes the darling of Hollywood society, all of whom are eager to include him as a guest at their dinner parties so he can regale everyone with inside tidbits and juicy gossip. Celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Kirk Douglas, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, David Geffen, Roddy McDowall, and June Anderson, social types like Nancy Reagan, Betsy Bloomingdale, and Nan Kempner, royalty such as Princess Diana, Princess Margaret, and Queen Noor of Jordan, and television personalities like Harvey Levin and Larry King make appearances in the book.
Background.
Bailey clearly is the author's alter ego. Like his creator, Bailey is a one-time film producer whose Hollywood career was derailed by alcoholism and other addictions. His daughter was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, and the killer's subsequent sentencing to only a few years in prison inspired him to become an advocate for battered women and seek justice for the underdog. For "Vanity Fair", he covered the trials of Claus von Bülow, William Kennedy Smith, Michael Skakel, and the Menendez brothers, and he authored the books "The Winners", "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles", "People Like Us", "An Inconvenient Woman", and "A Season in Purgatory", all titles by Dunne. His son, a one-time actor who appeared in "An American Werewolf in London", is now a successful film director, his ex-wife is suffering with multiple sclerosis, and for several days his son Alexander is missing in the Arizona desert. All of this mirrors Dunne's life.
Critical reception.
In the "New York Times", Laura Miller said the book "strikes a tone of gossipy nattering from the start and maintains it, with numbing consistency, all the way to its preposterous finale . . . Compounding this tedium is the book's virtually unedited condition, rife with repetitions and errors." 
James Collins of "Time" called it "thoroughly absorbing" and commented, ""Another City, Not My Own" might appear to be an exercise in name dropping, but let's be honest: there is something fascinating about hearing Elizabeth Taylor discuss Dennis Fung. What saves Dunne from seeming like an unbearable show-off is his good-spiritedness about his swell life - he makes it clear he is having a great time." 
Alexandra Jacobs of "Entertainment Weekly" graded the novel B, adding it "doesn't so much turn the case inside out . . . as furnish the hateful thing with a fancy chintz slipcover . . . Dunne bobs and weaves so skillfully from Veronica Hearst to Heidi Fleiss that his fiction (or is it journalism?) is something like delicate needlework. Guiltily mouthwatering stuff." 
In the online magazine "Slate", Alex Ross observed, "Dominick Dunne is a ridiculous man, but in an interesting way. He is not, in the conventional sense, a good writer. His prose lacks even the hasty, spasmodic felicities to which we are resigned in the age of word processing . . . Dunne can be ridiculed not merely for his aimless, dribbling style. What he calls a novel is hardly deserving of the name . . . So why is one inclined to forgive this book's faults? Dunne is nothing if not charming. The flair for gossip that got him into thousands of dinner parties also wears down the resistance of the reader . . . I got a kick out of "Another City, Not My Own". I devoured it in the proverbial single sitting. But the book is ultimately compromised and rendered stupid by the obliviousness of the author . . . It is a shoddy, daffy piece of work, but it provides four or five fine vignettes of Hollywood bedlam in the 1990s."

Song information.
The song was composed by Lionel Florence, who had also previously worked for various artists such as Nolwenn Leroy, and Christophe Maé himself.

In 2008, "On s'attache" won a NRJ Music Awards in the category 'Francophone song of the year'.
In France, the single was directly number-one on the SNEP chart, but dropped very quickly, remaining for four weeks in the top 50 and six weeks in the top 100, because the single was released in a limited edition. On the other hand, the single was the third most downloaded one of 2007.
In Belgium (Wallonia), "On s'attache" was charted for 38 weeks in the Ultratop 40, including a peak at #4 on June 16 and July 7, 2007.

Odostomia

Odostomia is the most speciose genus of minute sea snails, pyramidellid gastropod mollusks. This genus is placed in the family Pyramidellidae in the subfamily Odostomiinae. There are several hundred species in this diverse genus (Schander et al. 1999) 
Most of the description of species in the genus "Odostomia" was carried out by Dall & Bartsch in 1909. Many of the described species are however suspected of being synonyms, or are proven synonyms.
The European and American species of "Odostomia" differ in several anatomical and shell characteristics. They are therefore likely to be assigned to different genera.
Distribution.
The genus "Odostomia" is common in all oceans from the tropics to the polar regions. It is mainly known from coastal areas and sandy shores, and is less common in the deep sea.
Description.
There is little known about their life histories. Most species are only known from their shells.
Most species have a white of yellowish, minute, conical to ovate-conical shell, usually between 2 mm and 5 mm. The apex is rather obtuse or nipple-shaped, sinistrally or dextrally oriented to the teloconch. The protoconch is usually deeply immersed in the first of the succeeding turns. The shells are variously sculptured, usually with a microsculpture. The teleoconch contains in most cases between 4 and 6 whorls. The body whorl is usually large, comprising 50-60% of the total length. The aperture is suboval to ovate with the peristome incomplete behind. There is usually a tooth-like fold on the columella. The shells usually have a small umbilicus or none at all.
Life habits.
The members of "Odostomia" are ectoparasites on other molluscs, and polychaetes. First they pierce the body wall with the buccal stylet and then feed on them by sucking blood with their buccal pump. They have become a pest of oysters, mussels, scallops and slipper limpets. Most of the Odostomia species are host-specific, only a few are not. "Odostomia scalaris" MacGillivray, 1843 is an ectoparasite on a wide range of hosts but especially known as a pest of mussels. "Odostomia turrita" Hanley, 1844 has been found on the European lobster "Homarus gammarus" (Linnaeus, 1758).

Beautiful People (UK TV series)

Beautiful People is a British comedy drama television series based on the memoirs of Barneys creative director Simon Doonan. The series takes place in Reading, Berkshire, in 1997, where thirteen-year-old Simon Doonan and his best friend Kylie dream of escaping their dreary suburban surroundings and moving to cosmopolitan London "to live amongst the beautiful people". The first episode aired on BBC Two on 2 October 2008 and recorded overnight ratings of 1.5 million viewers and positive critical reaction. Episodes are self-contained, but do follow a loose story arc throughout the course of each series. The second and final series finished airing on 18 December 2009.
Series synopses.
Series 1
In 2008 New York City, Simon Doonan, a window-dresser at Barneys, tells his boyfriend Sacha various tales from his childhood in Reading. Most of Simon's stories center around how he came to own some of his most treasured possessions, which he finds a place for in his eccentric window displays. Over the course of the series, young Simon struggles to express his love of music, theatre, and fashion in a working class community, with local hooligans hounding him at school and a supportive but quirky family squashing his efforts at home. While it is implied, sexuality is not relevant.
Series 2
The second series of "Beautiful People" was broadcast in 2009, when Simon returns to Reading to mend his heart after breaking up with his boyfriend Sacha. As in the first series, Simon recounts stories from his childhood in Reading, but speaks directly to the viewer instead of to Sacha. Simon and Kylie's sexuality becomes more overt in the second series as the two lads become more comfortable with themselves. In the series finale, Simon finds himself attracted to a new boy at school, prompting him to come out to his mother after being dissuaded from running away from home.
Production.
The comedy was greenlit in May 2008 by Controller of BBC Two Lucy Lumsden and Controller of Comedy Commissioning Roly Keating. The six episodes were written by Jonathan Harvey ("Gimme Gimme Gimme") and directed by Gareth Carrivick. Studio filming was done at Shepperton Studios and exterior locations at Bushey, Hertfordshire, Harrow, London and New York City. Exterior scenes of the cul de sac where Simon lives are filmed on Crabtree Close in Bushey. Doonan grew up in Reading in the 1960s but Harvey moved the setting forward to the 1990s. Executive producer Jon Plowman hoped audiences would relate to Simon's childhood; "Every teenager thinks they're different [...] I hope the audience will think: 'That's me as a teenager being laughed at. Everyone else was in a gang together, and I was in a gang of one.' But the truth is, everyone is in a gang of one."
Olivia Colman helped the cast to bond on set by arranging a visit from a mobile blood donor unit.
Reception.
Broadcast and ratings.
Series 1 of "Beautiful People " was broadcast on Thursdays at 21:30 on BBC Two, during the channel's "Thursdays Are Funny" strand, and at 22:00 on BBC HD. Series 2 was broadcast at 22:00 on Fridays on BBC Two.
Critical reaction.
The series was previewed by "The Guardian"s Grace Dent as "a sort of camp, working-class British "Arrested Development"". Dent wrote that it "made laugh more than anything [she had seen so far on TV this year". Tim Teeman, the entertainment editor for "The Times", rated "How I Got My Vase" three out of five stars. Teeman complimented Ward-Wilkinson's and Williams's acting but did not believe the 1990s were long ago enough to feel nostalgia for. Hermione Eyre for "The Independent" praised Williams and Colman, and compared the show to "The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole".
Series Two.
The second series began on 13 November 2009 on BBC Two. The flashbacks in the second series are set in 1998. In the present-day scenes, Sacha and Simon have split up and Simon has returned to Reading. An ongoing storyline in 1998 concerns the unplanned pregnancy of Simon's sister Ashlene.
Awards.
In 2010, "Beautiful People" was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for "Outstanding Comedy Series" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.

De fide

De fide (of the faith) is a "theological note" or "theological qualification" that indicates that some religious doctrine is an essential part of Catholic faith and that denial of it is heresy.
The doctrine is de fide divina et ecclesiastica (of divine and ecclesiastical faith), if contained in the sources of revelation and therefore believed to have been revealed by God (de fide divina) and if taught by the Church (de fide ecclesiastica). If a doctrine has been solemnly defined by a pope or an ecumenical council as a dogma, the doctrine is de fide definita.
What is believed to be a truth contained in the sources of revelation thus becomes a "dogma", in the present ecclesiastical sense of this word, only when enunciated by the Church: "According to a long-standing usage a dogma is now understood to be a truth appertaining to faith or morals, revealed by God, transmitted from the Apostles in the Scriptures or by tradition, and proposed by the Church for the acceptance of the faithful."

Paxman Valenta

The Paxman Valenta was an engine that was made by Paxman diesels for the HST (British Rail Class 43 (HST)), and is still in use in various marine applications, such as the Upholder/Victoria class submarine.
The engine as originally fitted to the HSTs was designated 12RP200L and was a V12 four-stroke turbo-charged & intercooled diesel unit of 79 litres which develops 2,250 bhp at 1,500 rpm. The design of the Valenta was based on the Ventura which was fitted to the BR Class 29 diesel locomotives, amongst others.
Replacement.
Since 2005, Paxman Valenta-engined HST power cars have been refurbished with MTU16V4000 engines(except power cars operated by East Midlands Trains which are fitted with Paxman VP185 engines). There is no longer a Class 43 power car still fitted with a Paxman Valenta engine.
Around 20 November 2010, a Riding Inspector reported that the engine of powercar 43084 was blowing oil from the breather vent and crankcase door joints. The Paxman Service Engineer N Swager investigated the problem at the Heaton Maintenance Depot on 24 November. He examined the engine, number S468, and found that cylinder B-2 had low compression. A-2 piston and con rod assembly were first removed to gain access to the big end bearing block of B-2 cylinder. When B-2 piston was removed, it was found to be damaged and had some broken piston rings. This was the cause of S468 blowing oil due to combustion gasses pressurising the crankcase. A new piston was sent from the Paxman factory at Colchester; a new cylinder liner was also fitted from the spares stock at Heaton, and powercar 43084 returned to service. Powercars, 43084 and 43123 were the last two Valenta-engined powercars in service. They were taken out of traffic on 22 December 2010, after 4 farewell tours between York and Sunderland. They have since been fitted with MTU 16V4000 engines.
Restoration.
In May 2011, it was announced that the 125 Group would return prototype HST powercar 41001 to service. The powercar, currently on static display in the York National Railway Museum, will receive a full overhaul subject to technical assessment on both the vehicle and component parts. The overhaul is expected to pay particular attention to cooler group, bogies and electrical and electronic components. 
The powercar will also receive installation of production Paxman Valenta RP200L engine Number S508 (installed new into 43153 in 2001 under Virgin CrossCountry, before re-installation to 43143 of First Great Western after a spell in storage), donated to the NRM from the MTU re-power programme. This will mark a sooner return to traffic of a Paxman Valenta powercar than previously expected. The work is currently being undertaken at East Midlands Trains HST depot Neville Hill T&RSMD.
Australian XPT.
The engine was also fitted to the XPT of New South Wales, which was based on the HST power car design. 18 power car units were ordered, and built in Australia, by Commonwealth engineering Granville. All 18 XP classed units are in service Like the HST, these power cars have since been re-engined with the VP185.

Trochulus lubomirskii

Trochulus lubomirskii is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Hygromiidae, the hairy snails and their allies.
Taxonomy.
Schileyko (1978) placed this species in the subgenus "Plicuteria" Schileyko, 1978. However, based on molecular analyses, this species may not actually belong in the genus "Trochulus".
Nomenclature.
The spelling of the name is currently disputed. In the original source the name was spelled "Helix (Fruticicola) Lubomirski", to be corrected to "lubomirski" under the ICZN Code. Later many authors spelled the name "lubomirskii", but some other authors used the spelling "lubomirski". The 4th edition of the Code (effective since 2000) gives no clear ruling (previous editions of the Code had a clear ruling that "lubomirski" was the correct form), so this case will remain disputed.

<doc id="19607550" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19607550" title="Paxman Ventura">
Paxman Ventura

The Paxman Ventura is a diesel engine for railway locomotives, built by Davey, Paxman & Co.
The type YJ or "Ventura" was developed in the mid-1950s as Davey, Paxman's first high-speed diesel engine. With a view to the forthcoming modernisation and dieselisation of British Railways, it was intended as a successor to Paxman's existing medium-speed engine, the direct injection YH. High-speed engines offered higher power-to-weight ratios, which in turn allowed locomotives to have a lower axle loading and greater route availability. Their construction and reliable use though required more sophisticated manufacture than previously, with better metallurgy and balancing of the moving parts for faster running and a stiffer crankcase to avoid vibration.
Description.
Like its medium-speed predecessor the Paxman YH, the "Ventura" is a 60° V engine with either 12 or 16 cylinders. The engines are similar in many details and broadly similar in capacity and power; their main differences are in their operating speed, the improvements necessary to achieve this, and the Ventura's resulting lighter weight.
The crankcase and cylinder block are fabricated from steel by welding a mixture of steel castings and platework. This gives a more rigid structure than the YH's cast light alloy block. The aluminium frame of the YH and ZH engines had previously given trouble with cracking and had to be replaced in the Class 17 with a cast iron frame, at Paxman's expense. Both have individual aluminium cylinder heads for each cylinder. Centrifugally cast iron wet cylinder liners are used with aluminium pistons are used in both. These pistons have three compression rings and two oil-control rings. The top ring is carried in a cast iron insert. The combustion chamber of this direct injection engine is a toroidal recess in the piston crown.
Both engines were developed for diesel electric locomotives and so their crankshafts have the unusual feature of an additional main bearing at the drive end, to help support the weight of the generator armature, where a single-bearing generator can be otherwise unsupported at one end.
Fork and blade connecting rods are used, with the inner rod running on the outside of a shared bearing sleeve.
There are four valves per cylinder, driven by pushrods and rockers from a single camshaft between the cylinder banks. The fuel injector is centrally mounted between the valves, and is supplied by a pair of inline fuel injection pumps, one per bank.
The single turbocharger is carried above the engine, with its axis longitudinal.
Smaller, single bank six- and eight-cylinder engine, the 6YJ and 8YJ, were derived from the V engine.
Use.
Type 42 destroyer, as a set of four generator sets, each rated at 1 MW.

The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam Prisoners of War

The Code of Conduct and the Vietnam War is a report from an individual research project conducted by John McCain, Commander, United States Navy, at the National War College. It has a 44 pages and was released on April 8, 1974.
The purpose of this paper was to review the Code of Conduct in the perspective of the Vietnam prisoner of war experience and to make recommendations for changes to the code itself and to the training and indoctrination of the members of the Armed Forces in the Code of Conduct. Additionally, recommendations are presented for the education of the members of the Armed Forces and the U.S. public in order to minimize the use of POWS in the future as political hostages and propaganda vehicles.
The Vietnam War was the first test of the Code of Conduct. The majority of the American POWS were held captive longer than in any other war engaged in by Americans. The paper discusses the Code of Conduct, article by article, and assesses its value and viability as they related to the Vietnam War experience. The report compares conditions and treatment American POWs experienced in Vietnam, and how it affected their ability to live up to the code.
In the report Commander McCain writes that, "The American people have been inoculated with too many John Wayne movies and other examples of unbreakable will and super human strength. It has been amply proved that every man has a breaking point."

<doc id="19607653" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19607653" title="Aka Island">
Aka Island

The island is commonly known as Aka or Aka-shima and is located some 15 miles to the southwest of Okinawa Island. It has a subtropical climate and a population of approximately 330 people.
Coral reefs and wildlife.
The water surrounding Aka-jima is supplied from the Kuroshio current. Healthy coral reefs, with a rich diversity of sea life, make the area a treasure trove for marine scientists, divers and snorkelers.
In 1988 Akajima Marine Science Laboratory (AMSL) was established under the auspices of the Japanese Science and Technology Agency. A number of scientists visit AMSL every year to research the coral reef ecosystems.
Around 360 fish species and 1,640 invertebrate species (including hermatypic corals) and 220 seaweed species have been recorded in the Kerama Islands, but many groups of organisms have not yet been surveyed. Green turtles, loggerheads, and hawksbill turtle lay eggs on the beaches in summer. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are regular visitors in January to April and use the Kerama Islands as their breeding ground.
Akajima is also noted for its terrestrial wildlife, especially its birds, butterflies and Golden silk orb-weaver spiders. Kerama deer (a subspecies of the Japanese deer) are unique to the Kerama islands group and are able to swim between the islands. These deer have been designated a national protected species of Japan.
Climate.
Summers have extreme oceanographic conditions and about five typhoons approach Akajima every year, especially in early summer. The northern monsoon brings strong north winds and large swells from October to April.
Transport.
Akajima port has a regular ferry service that links the island with neighbouring Zamami and the capital of Okinawa (Naha). The Island is also served a small airstrip on Gerumajima, the two islands being linked by a small road bridge.
History.
Historically, the Kerama Island group was a part of the Ryukyu Kingdom. For some 600 years, the islanders were employed as navigators for the Kingdom’s trading vessels between Okinawa and China. The islands also provided good moorings on the sea route. A house of the Takara family, one of the captains of these vessels, is preserved as an Important Cultural Property of Japan.
Aka was one of the first landing places for US Forces in the Battle of Okinawa. US Forces landed on March 26, 1945 and went on to take islands of Zamami, Geruma and Tokashiki. Over 500 residents committed suicide by order of the Japanese troops in order to avoid capture.
Aka-jima is also famous for the story of two dogs: Shiro on Aka-jima and Marilyn on Zamami-jima. They met when Shiro travelled on his owners boat to Zamami but the passion was such that he started swimming over every day to rendezvous with Marilyn on Zamami's Ama beach.
The locals frequently sighted Shiro paddling across the (3 km) strait. His feat was so amazing that it gained national recognition and inspired the film: Marilyn ni Aitai (I want to see Marilyn). Marilyn died in 1987, bringing an end to Shiro's seafaring days, and he himself died at the advanced age of 17. There is a statue of Shiro on Nishihama beach (his point of departure) and a similar monument to Marilyn also exists on Zamamijima.

Angelos Kitsos

Angelos Kitsos (; 1934 – 6 August 2008) was the president of Rizarios Foundation (Ριζάρειο Ίδρυμα).He was a Greek from Monodendri, Zagori. He was member of the Councils of the Foundation for the Restoration of Greeks from Albania (Ίδρυμα Αποκαταστάσεως Ομογενών εξ Αλβανίας,I.A.O.A.) and the Foundation of Research of the Ionian and Adriatic space. He was a towering figure for Zagori and the rest of Epirus and Western Greece. Kitsos was a lawyer, but he also worked on script-writing for a number of documentaries, and wrote a number of books.
Early life.
He was born in Corfu, Greece. His father was Athanasios Kitsos and also was a lawyer. Angelos went to the historical Kaplaneios School for primary education till 1945, that he entered the (also historical for Ioannina) Zosimaia School. His classmate during primary and secondary, Christos Makris, says: ""The entire class was depending on him![...] While we read "Thesaurus", "Romance" and the "Mask", he read Dostoevsky, Tolstoi, Hemingway, Rousseau, Voltaire, Nitsche..."'" Angelos studied law, at the Law School of Athens.
Career.
In 1960, he was employed in the National Foundation (Εθνικό Ίδρυμα), where in 1961 he was given responsibility of the Sector of Programme of Communal Development. In 1971, he was elected as lifelong member of the Council of the Rizarios Foundation. In 1974, he became Director of Cultural Programmes in the National Foundation. More specifically, in the National Foundation, he worked mainly on the programmes of local development of Thessaloniki, Chalcidice and Eurytania.
Co-operations for development.
Kitsos co-operated with the American Agricultural School, the Bureau of Social Affairs of the United Nations, the EOEX, the CARE Organisation, the National Centre, the Greek Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Greek Ministry of Agriculture, the Greek Ministry of Education, the Centre of Constant Training of Public Servants. E.R.A. (Ελληνική Ραδιοφωνία), the state radio station, often consulted Angelos's large disc library, that already numbered over 9000 discs in the 70s. <br> 
<br>In co-operation with the "Stavros S. Niarchos" foundation and the University of Athens, Angelos managed to build the Social Hospice, the International Centre of Culture and Tradition and the Unit of Natural Medicine. He also co-operated with the director group of Roberus Manthoulis, Photis Mesthenaios, Hercules Papadakis and as executive producer and script-writer produced, on the account of the National Foundation a number of films and documentaries. He also co-operated with Kostas Fronzos to build the 1st Student Hospice and with Froso Ioannidi to build the Pupil Hospice of Tsepelovo. In the Foundation for Restoration of Greeks from Albania, he built the Centre of Professional Training of Pogoniani, a move characterised by the Wall Street Journal as " major lesson of diplomacy in the Balkans".
Activities in the Rizarios Foundation.
Angelos Kitsos has connected his name with all attempts of development of the wealth of Rizarios foundation in favor of Epirus. He was the main negotiator with the Karamanlis government (1979) for the exchange of an area in Vassilisis Sofias Avenue in Athens, for the Ionian School, 17.000m2 in the Delta of Phalero and equal area in Ioannina, including the Agricultural Boarding School. Also, in co-operation with Stathi Lampridi, Yanni Sarali and Thanasi Liouma, he managed that 30% of the annual income of Rizarios Foundation went in favor of Zagori. As president of the foundation,Kitsos was the instigator of building the Rizarios Handcraft Centre, the Rizarios Exhibition Centre, the Open-Air Theatre and Sports Stadium of Monodendri, the first of which is to be named after him. In co-operation with the Latsis Group and the "Stavros S.Niarchos" foundation, Angelos Kitsos brought to Monodendri a number of rare exhibitions, some of which were opened by the President of the Hellenic Republic himself.
