Big Kuntry King

Sean Merrett (born c. 1978), better known by his stage name Big Kuntry King is an American hip hop recording artist from Atlanta, Georgia. He's a member of southern hip hop group P$C, along with longtime friend and fellow Atlanta rapper T.I.. He is currently signed to Grand Hustle and Atlantic Records and is also the founder of his own record label, Bread Box Muzic. His debut studio album "My Turn to Eat" was released September 30, 2008.
Biography.
1978-2007: Early life and career beginnings.
Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Big Kuntry King was raised in a house that held his mother, sister, and close to ten members of his extended family. When he reached the fifth grade, Kuntry moved to Atlanta with his mother, who sought a better life for her kids. While his mom worked two jobs and pursued a community college degree, Kuntry gravitated to street life, where his family had a notorious history. “I was born in the game,” says Kuntry. “My Grand Momma was in it before she died. My Auntie was in it; everybody was in it.”
A couple of years after his father was released from a seven-year stint in federal prison, Kuntry started rapping as a way to earn extra money. In 1996, Kuntry befriended local up-and-coming rapper T.I., who was already known around Atlanta as a skilled lyricist, and together they sold mixtapes out the trunk of their car. “The raps, that was our dope,” Kuntry says. “We was rapping because we knew we could make us enough money to buy something and get out. And it made us look good in our neighborhood and every other neighborhood in the A.”
Big Kuntry King’s first major feature spot came on T.I.’s debut studio album, "I'm Serious" (2001), on the song "Heavy Chevys." In between appearing on subsequent T.I. albums like "Trap Muzik" (2003) and "Urban Legend" (2004), Big Kuntry recorded and released several songs on his own, including "Still Country" and "Throwback." As a member of P$C, the Grand Hustle-signed five-man group released their debut album, "25 to Life", in 2005, which spawned the lead single, "I'm a King" featuring Lil' Scrappy. With the release of the P$C album, Big Kuntry was suddenly introduced to a nationwide audience but unfortunately for him, it wasn’t his star that T.I. and Grand Hustle focused on making the brightest: "They had just signed Young Dro, and Tip made this song ‘Shoulder Lean’ for him, he threw some verses on it and it was a smash song. We was like damn, we’ve been here since day one killing it and you’re going to come out with Young Dro? That’s when I said man, I have to step this up."
In 2006, he was featured on the remix to T.I.'s "Top Back", also featuring Young Jeezy, Young Dro and B.G.. The remix was included on the Grand Hustle compilation album "" (2006).
2008-present: "My Turn to Eat".
While T.I. and the rest of the camp were overseas playing shows in Japan, Kuntry was in the studio by himself recording solo material. It didn’t take long for Kuntry to craft the catchy tracks, "Yeah I’m On It" and "That’s Right," which both featured Kuntry’s drawn out signature adlib, "You know who this is man, Big Kuntry King!". "I took all of my money and pressed up the ‘Yeah I’m On It’ record,” he says. "And by the time they came back from Japan, I had two records on the radio and playing in the clubs." Determined to succeed, Kuntry was signed as a solo artist to Atlantic Records, where he released his solo debut studio album, "My Turn to Eat": "I always thought it was my turn to eat cause I’m hungry. All these people are eating more around me, so either I have to take some food off their plate."
After recording for close to a year, Kuntry’s debut was a solid collection of songs produced by some of Atlanta’s trend-setting track masters, including Shawty Redd and Marvelous J. On the song "Pots and Pans," Kuntry breaks down the difference between the music he was raised on Down South as opposed to what people up North were accustomed to hearing. On the Nard & B produced cut "Soul of a Man," Kuntry talks about the heavy expectations that are placed on men everyday, and the common struggle to always do the right thing. Kuntry’s track "Posse" is all about repping where he’s from and the company that he keeps: "If you listen to my album you’re going to be rockin’ the whole time,” he says. “I hand-picked all of my beats and I’m very picky. A lot of people tell me I got an ear and I appreciate it ‘cause this ear is going to get me paid.” Cha-ching!". "I think my music is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” he says. "It’s like, he’s funny, he’s cracking jokes but he’s serious ain’t he? It’s a psychological thing; I don’t think a lot of rappers are like that." The album, released September 30, 2008, debuted at #98 on the "Billboard" 200.
On February 27, 2012, Big Kuntry King released a mixtape titled "100% (KANE)", including production from Zaytoven, Nard & B and Two Band Geeks and features a guest appearance from T.I. On December 12, 2012 Big Kuntry King released another mixtape, "Dope & Champagne".

DuMont Building

The DuMont Building (also known as 515 Madison Avenue) is a 532 foot (162 m) high building at 53rd Street and Madison Avenue in New York City.
The building was built in art deco and neo-gothic style by John H. Carpenter and designed by his brother, architect J.E.R. Carpenter who also designed Lincoln Tower as well as nearly 125 buildings along Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue.
One of the building's most distinctive features is a broadcasting antenna that traces back to the building's role in the first television broadcasts of WNYW in 1938. 
In 1938, Allen B. DuMont began broadcasting experimental television W2XWV from the building. In 1944, the station became WABD, named for his initials. The station was one of the few that continued to broadcast through World War II. The broadcast of news about the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki in 1945 was considered the beginning of the DuMont Television Network. 
After the war, the network/station moved to bigger studios - first at the old Wanamaker's store at Ninth and Broadway in Greenwich Village, then the Adelphi Theatre, the Ambassador Theatre, and in 1954 to the Jacob Ruppert Central Opera House at 205 East 67th and which today is the Fox Television Center.
In 1947, the building was the site of a protest by 700 picketers demanding that the United States end diplomatic relations with Spain as a protest against the government of Francisco Franco at the site of the Spanish consulate, located in the building.
In 1962, the building was sold to Newmark & Co. which still owns and manages it. 
In 1977, WKCR-FM, the radio station of Columbia University, became the first radio (or television) station to transmit from the antenna atop the World Trade Center, having previously broadcast from an antenna atop the DuMont Building for 19 years, until the construction of other surrounding skyscrapers started interfering with the station's signal.

1983 Winchester 400

The 1983 Winchester 400 motor race, the fourteenth annual (run yearly since 1970), was held as the Silver Creek Winchester 400 under American Speed Association sanction on October 2, 1983, at the Winchester Speedway, in Indiana (USA).
Proving once again to be one of the most dominant drivers in "400" history, Mike Eddy collected his second win in the 1983 running of the fall classic. After, once again, dominating most of the day, Eddy overcame some late pit strategy to score the win. Wisconsin’s Dick Trickle started from the pole, but it was Bob Strait shooting into the lead at the drop of the green. Starting third, Eddy quickly worked to the front and took over the lead on lap 14. The first round of pit stops came on lap 96, when the caution waved for a spin by Dennis Vogel. Under caution, Trickle would assume the lead for one lap before giving way to Alan Kulwicki. Strait went back to the lead on lap 114, but began to suffer tire problems as Eddy reassumed the lap on lap 133.
The race.
The eventual-winner got a big scare on lap 183. Attempting to lap the now ill-handling car of Kulwicki, Eddy and he made contact sending Kulwicki hard into the outside wall. Eddy lost the lead as he pitted to repair some minor damage, but was able to charge back through the field, passing Harold Fair for the lead on lap 200.
As usual, the demanding Winchester highbanks proved to be hard on equipment. Defending race winner Rusty Wallace lost three laps with a flat tire. Five-time winner Bob Senneker suffered rear end problems and would later crash out of the event on lap 252. Mark Martin dropped out with ignition trouble, but returned to the race as a relief-driver for Bob Sensiba in the middle stages of the race. After leading for a brief stint, Strait retired with overheating problems.
Back behind the wheel, Sensiba spun on lap 375 to bring out the final caution of the race. Under the yellow, Eddy gave up the lead to pit for fresh tires while runner-up Butch Miller decided to gamble and try to hold off the field on older tires. The gamble failed as Eddy stormed by for the lead on lap 387 and pulled away for his second win in the past three years. Miller came home second followed by Jim Sauter, 1980 winner Terry Senneker, and Tom Jones. Eddy collected $10,800 for his day’s work.

Fatu Feu'u

Fatu Akelei Feu'u, ONZM (Born 1946) is a noted Samoan painter. 
Feu'u grew up in the village of Poutasi in the district of Falealili in Samoa. 
Feu'u emigrated to New Zealand in 1966. He has established a reputation as the elder statesman of Pacific art in New Zealand. Feu'u has been an exhibiting artist since the early 1980s and became a full-time artist in 1988.
Feu'u was appointed a Honorary Officer of New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2001 New Years Honours List.
Exhibitions.
Feu'u has exhibited in numerous exhibitions in New Zealand and internationally with works in national and private collections world wide. He has exhibited in solo and major group exhibitions including "Samoa Contemporary" (2008) at the Pataka art gallery in Porirua. 
Feu'u was part of the major group exhibition "Le Folauga: the past coming forward - Contemporary Pacific Art from Aotearoa New Zealand", at the Auckland Museum. "Le Folauga" later toured to Taiwan and became the first exhibition of contemporary Pacific art from New Zealand to be shown in a major fine arts museum in Asia. "Le Folauga" opened at the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts in Taiwan from 13 December 2008 to 5 April 2009.
Artistic mediums.
While primarily a painter, Feu'u explores a range of other mediums including bronze, wood and stone sculpture, pottery design, lithographs, woodcuts and glass works (both stained and etched).
Polynesian influences.
Feu'u's work is inspired by Polynesian art forms such as siapo (tapa cloth), tatau (tattoo), weaving, carving and ceremonial mask making. In these forms he uses a rich lexicon of motifs and compositional structures. His works frequently blend traditional and contemporary elements, incorporating a range of influences, inspirations, techniques and motifs from Samoa and Aotearoa and more generally from Euro-American to Pacific cultures.
Fa'asamoa.
Fa'asamoa is the unifying element of Feu'u's work. The term "fa'asamoa" is generally defined as 'the Samoan way'. The social structure of Samoan society is held together and actively maintained by an adherence to unwritten but understood cultural conventions embodied in "fa'asamoa" which binds family networks to traditional customs and ceremonies.
Collections.
Feu'u's work is included in a number of prestigious national and international collections including the National Gallery, Brisbane; Auckland Art Gallery; Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington and Waikato Museum of Art and History, Hamilton. His work is also included in an extensive number of private collections in New Zealand, Australia, United States of America, England, Holland, American Samoa, Samoa and Japan.
Tautai arts organisation.
Tautai, an organisation of contemporary Pacific artists in New Zealand, was founded in the 1980s as an informal network from an initiative by Feu'u and artist friends. This group shared a goal of mutual support for the promotion of Pacific visual art artists, at a time when Pacific art was in the very early stages of recognition as a particular genre. In 2005, Tautai celebrated its 10th anniversary as a formalised organisation. Members include other established Pacific artists such as painter and sculptor Johnny Penisula, multi-media artist Shigeyuki Kihara and Michel Tuffery.

Björn Kjellström

Björn Kjellström (9 September 1910 – 26 August 1995), originally from Sweden, was a ski orienteering champion in Sweden and co-founder of the compass manufacturing company Silva Sweden AB. More than 25 million Silva compasses have been sold since the founding of the company.
Early life.
Kjellström competed in his first orienteering race in Sweden in May 1928 at the age of 17, where he finished last in the beginners' class. However, by fall of the same year he won a district orienteering championship race outside Stockholm. During the years that followed Kjellström and his brothers won many orienteering races, both individually and as a three-man team.
Silva Company.
In 1932, working with his two brothers and a machinist, Gunnar Tillander, Kjellström helped perfect a new type of compass for terrestrial navigation, featuring a liquid-damped magnetized needle housing com and a protractor built into a transparent baseplate.
In 1946, he moved to the United States, where he founded the U.S. operations of the Silva Company (later Silva, Inc.) in La Porte, Indiana. Two years later, he organized Silva Ltd. in Toronto, Canada for sales in Canada. Kjellström also organized Silva Orienteering Services of La Porte Indiana to provide training and company sponsorship for the sport of orienteering in North America.
In 1955, Kjellström published a hugely popular book on outdoor land navigation and the sport of orienteering, "Be Expert With Map and Compass". To date, "Be Expert With Map and Compass" has sold more than 500,000 copies in English and has been translated into several languages, and has remained continuously in print since its first publication.
Kjellström co-founded the United States Orienteering Federation in 1971 and served as vice president of the International Ski Federation from 1951 to 1979. Johnson Worldwide Associates (JWA), later Johnson Outdoors, Inc. bought Silva Inc. in 1973, and production shifted back to Sweden in 1981. As of 1995, the Silva compass was made in more than 50 models.
Later years.
In later years, Kjellström moved to Pound Ridge, N.Y., where he helped develop trails in a county park and forest reserve called Ward Pound Ridge Reservation and to produce a detailed orienteering map of the area. He continued to be active until his death in promoting the Silva compass and the sport of orienteering, as well as conducting promotional book tours for revised versions of "Be Expert With Map and Compass".
Kjellström died 26 August 1995 in a hospital in Stockholm, Sweden due to complications of Parkinson's disease.
Postscript.
After Kjellström's death, the Swedish parent company, Silva of Sweden AB, decided to end its North American distribution agreement with Silva Inc./Silva Ltd. and JWA. After two years of litigation, Silva of Sweden AB and JWA agreed to confirm JWA (Johnson Outdoors) exclusive right to distribute compasses under the Silva name in North America. Since 1998, Johnson Outdoors has distributed Silva compasses in North America made its specifications by third-party manufacturers, while Silva of Sweden AB distributes compasses assembled at its Haninge, Sweden facility to markets outside North America.

Clifton Savings Bancorp

Clifton Savings Bancorp, Inc., d/b/a Clifton Savings Bank, is a publicly traded American retail savings bank located in Clifton, New Jersey, USA. The bank operates twelve branches in northern New Jersey.
History.
Clifton Savings Bancorp was founded as Botany Building and Loan Association in 1928 in Clifton's Botany Village section of town. The bank became known as East Clifton Building and Loan two years later and assumed the name Clifton Savings and Loan Association in 1954, all while remaining in the Botany section of Clifton; the bank served as the company's headquarters until 1998, changed addresses three times, and closed in July 2010.
The bank's first branch office was opened in the Richfield section of Clifton in 1954, and is located on the portion of Clifton Avenue designated NJ 161. Fourteen years later Clifton Savings added a third branch in Clifton's Athenia section, in a storefront located on Van Houten Avenue. Two more branches opened in 1970 and 1971, on Lakeview Avenue and Valley Road in the Lakeview and Albion sections of town.
In 1975 Clifton Savings expanded their operations to outside of their base, opening a branch on Palisade Avenue in neighboring Garfield. Two years later a second Garfield branch opened on Lanza Avenue.
In 1981, Clifton Savings opened two new locations. Both were located on Van Houten Avenue; one was a replacement for the old Athenia storefront branch and the other was a large branch in the Maple Valley section of the city which served as both a bank and the headquarters for Clifton Savings' mortgage lending department (which the bank has since moved to a separate office space in the Allwood section of Clifton). In 1998, during a massive remodeling, the Maple Valley branch became the bank's base of operations, as well as becoming the first branch to install an ATM; an ATM has since been installed at all but three branches. The Maple Valley branch was also the last new, non-replacement branch to be built for over twenty years.
Clifton Savings opened six new branches in the 2000s. Of the six, three were built to replace existing banks; those locations were in the Athenia section of Clifton and Garfield (as both of the bank's branches were replaced). The other three branches are located in Wallington, Wayne, and Fair Lawn, New Jersey; the former two branches opened in 2003 and the latter in 2009. Clifton Savings' most recent openings are in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, at the site of a former TD Banknorth branch, and in Woodland Park, New Jersey, at the site of a former Capital One Bank branch. Both of these branches were opened in 2010. Clifton Savings' last three openings have been in locations that formerly housed other financial institutions; the Fair Lawn branch was a former Washington Mutual branch that JPMorgan Chase elected not to convert to a Chase branch.
At Clifton Savings' twelve branches, there are ten ATMs and eight drive-up windows. The Lakeview, Wayne, and Woodland Park branches do not offer drive-through banking, and the Richfield branch does not have an ATM. The Albion branch does not offer either option because the bank is in a very small strip mall that does not have enough room and also has several businesses that offer ATMs.
Going public.
In 2004, as part of a reorganization, Clifton Savings Bank was reincorporated as a federal mutual holding company and took its current name. Later that year, using the ticker symbol CSBK, the company became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock market. The bank became a federal savings bank in 2007.

Tumulla was a crossing loop part way up the steep Tumulla Bank.
Overview.
The loop opened in 1910, and was signalled for Up and Down Working. The loop was about 400m long.
Because of the steep grades, there was a safety siding at the down hill end of the up loop in case of runaways.
There was also a catchpoint at the down hill end of the down loop.
The loop was closed around 1990.

1984 Winchester 400

The 1984 Winchester 400 motor race, the fifteenth annual (run yearly since 1970), was held under American Speed Association sanction on September 30, 1984, at the Winchester Speedway, in Indiana (USA).
After five-straight wins followed by five-straight years of frustration the undisputed king of the "Winchester 400" reassumed his throne as Bob Senneker scored his sixth win in the closest "400" finish to date. Starting from the pole for the second-straight year, Wisconsin’s Dick Trickle jumped into the lead at the drop of the green. Holding off ASA Championship rivals Jim Sauter and Senneker, Trickle set a torrid pace in the early stages. Trickle made his first appearance on pit road on lap 128, handing the lead to Senneker. The race would continue on a record pace as Senneker led until lap 224 when Mark Martin moved in front.
The race.
Racing in the top-five all day, Sauter began encountering steering problems and spun. Senneker reassumed the lead during a round of pit stops, but would give up the lead on lap 242 when he pitted for another set of fresh tires. That would give the lead back to Martin who would stay in front until he pitted on lap 305. Bobby Dotter then assumed the lead, but it would be short-lived as Senneker went back in front on lap 317. After going down a lap early in the event with tire problems, defending race-winner Mike Eddy worked his way back onto the lead lap, only to have a shock absorber fail and send him spinning on lap 336.
Under the resulting caution, Martin made his final pit stop and took on tires to try to chase down his first "400" win. The late stages of the race saw shades of Martin and Eddy in 1980, as Martin once again tried lap-after-lap to pass an ASA legend. Martin was able to pull alongside Senneker on several occasions, but was unable to compete the pass. At the checkers, Senneker held off Martin by four-car lengths (0.650 seconds), with Trickle a mere 12 seconds behind the winner in third. Butch Miller also completed all 400 laps to finish fourth while Dotter was fifth, one lap off the winner’s pace. Senneker collected an event-record $11,670 for his sixth win.

Gojoseon–Han War

The Gojoseon–Han War was a campaign launched by the Han empire against Wiman Joseon of the Gojoseon kingdom between 109 and 108 BC. It resulted in the fall of Gojoseon.
Background.
Since the time that Wiman took the Gojoseon throne, relations between Han and Gojoseon had been deteriorating. King Ugeo of Gojoseon interrupted direct contact with envoys sent by chiefs of various tribes on the Korean Peninsula to the Han empire, thus Emperor Wu of Han dispatched the emissary She He (涉何) to Gojoseon. After an audience with the king, She He failed in securing the safe passage of the envoys. While returning to his nation, She He killed Jang (長), an assistant of the Gojoseon king. Due to this action, the king sent out troops to kill She He. The direct pretext for war thus came when King Ugeo had the Han envoy executed, which had angered Emperor Wu considerably. However, it is thought by modern historians that the initiation of war was also brought by the desire to remove the possibility that Gojoseon would ally with the Xiongnu against the Han or by the deteriorating relations between Han and Gojoseon when Wiman Joseon prevented trade between Chinbon and Han.
Course of the war.
In 109 BC, Emperor Wu launched a Han military campaign into Gojoseon. Two forces—totaling about 50,000 troops led by Yang Fu (楊僕) and Xun Zhi (荀彘) respectively—set out from the Han empire to invade the kingdom. A navy sailed from Qi (present-day Shandong Province) across the Bohai Sea towards Gojoseon, while an army marched through Liaodong and headed towards Wanggeom, the capital of Gojoseon.
In a series of unsuccessful attempts by the Han forces to take the city in the first year of the war, King Ugeo kept Wanggeom from the Han forces. Xun Zhi, having overall command by the Emperor Wu, imprisoned Yang Fu and unified the whole Han forces and the attacks became stronger. Wiman Joseon officials such as No In (朝鮮相 路人), Han Eum (相 韓陰), Sam (尼谿相 參), Wang Gyeop (王唊) insisted to surrender to Han. But King Ugeo disagreed. Eventually, in April of 108 BC, three of the ministers surrendered to Han and Sam later let King Ugeo be assassinated. Under the leadership of Minister Seong Gi (成己), Gojoseon people still struggled against Han. But, Seong Gi was also assassinated and the city finally fell to Han.
Aftermath.
After the war, four Han commanderies were founded to administer the former Gojoseon territories, namely Lelang, Xuantu, Zhenfan, and Lintun. The most significant commandery was located in Lelang (near present-day Pyongyang), which controlled the region until 313 AD. The conquest of Gojoseon in 108 BC by Han, ultimately led to the Proto-Three Kingdoms period of Korea.

New South Wales 45 (later 71) class locomotive

The 45 class was a class of mainline electric locomotive built in-house in 1952 by the New South Wales Government Railways' Chullora Railway Workshops. With only a single locomotive in the class, 4501 was renumbered 7100 in October 1961 freeing up the number range for the 45 class diesel locomotives.
Construction.
The sole member of the class was designed by the New South Wales Government Railways and was built at their Chullora Railway Workshops using components supplied by Commonwealth Engineering. It was completed in June 1952 and numbered 4501.
Operation.
4501 had a one-hour power rating of with a total weight of . Its maximum speed was It had a driving compartment at each end of its very box-shaped body. Its colour scheme being bottle green, with chrome lining, it became affectionately known as the "Green Beetle".
Its purpose was to provide experience of operating powerful electric locomotives prior to the arrival of the 46 class locomotives which had been ordered from England for use on the electrified line to Bowenfels. Once the electrification project had reached Penrith in October 1955, 4501 had its first opportunity to haul passenger trains. Six months later, when the first 46-class arrived, the locomotive became a regular assistant locomotive for steam powered trains between North Strathfield and Hornsby.
In 1957 it was transferred to the Flemington Maintenance Depot where it was employed as a shunter. At the time, Flemington was the base for all locomotive hauled air-conditioned trains.
In October 1961 it was re-numbered 7100. In 1968 it received a major overhaul where several tonnes of additional ballast was added. Main-line safeworking equipment was provided to allow it to haul coal trains over the newly electrified Main South from Glenlee, south of Macarthur to Rozelle.
Demise.
Failures dogged the veteran locomotive and it was withdrawn in June 1974. Following an extended period of storage, it was placed at the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum moved to Thirlmere. In April 2009 it was relocated to the former Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot. It is now on RailCorp's heritage list.

Western Australian state election, 1965

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 20 February 1965 to elect all 50 members to the Legislative Assembly and 15 members to the 30-seat Legislative Council. The Liberal-Country coalition government, led by Premier Sir David Brand, won a third term in office against the Labor Party, led by Opposition Leader Bert Hawke.
Electoral changes.
The Legislative Council election held on the same day was the first since significant changes to the Council's structure and manner of voting under the "Constitution Acts Amendment Act (No.2) 1963" (No.72 of 1963). The Act abolished the 10 three-member provinces which had existed almost unaltered since 1900, and created 15 new two-member provinces. Voting became compulsory and the property franchise was abolished, and the practice of having separate Legislative Council elections in May of every even-numbered year was abolished—the Council's members would now go to the voters at the same elections as members of the Legislative Assembly, although the rotational system where one member per province would retire at each election remained in effect, and unlike the Assembly, the Council's term expired on 22 May every three years, rather than at the election itself.
A number of transitional arrangements were necessary to put these changes into effect. Those who had terms expiring on 21 May 1964, and five of the ten whose terms were to expire on 21 May 1966 (those who had the lowest winning margins at the 1960 election) would retire on 21 May 1965. The remaining 15 members were eligible to be appointed to new provinces for terms expiring on 21 May 1968.

1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game

The 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 41st midseason exhibition between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was played on July 14, 1970 at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, home of the Cincinnati Reds of the National League. The game resulted in a 5-4 victory for the NL.
Riverfront Stadium had barely been open two weeks when it hosted its first All-Star Game. The game had been hosted by the Cincinnati Reds twice before (1938 and 1953) when their home park had been Crosley Field. The Reds would host one more All-Star Game at Riverfront Stadium in 1988. So close was the opening of the stadium and the scheduled exhibition game, that Major League Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn did not confirm that the game would "definitely" be played in Cincinnati until June 1. Atlanta had been the alternative site.
Undeniably, the most remembered moment of the game was the final run, scored in the bottom of the twelfth by Pete Rose. The ball had been relayed to the American League catcher, Ray Fosse, in time to tag Rose out, but the tenacious Rose bowled Fosse over. Both players were injured, Fosse enough to drop the ball, giving Rose credit for the game-winning run.
Fan balloting returns.
For the first time since 1957, Major League Baseball restored the selection of the eight position players on each All-Star team to the fans. Fan balloting had been revoked after ballot-stuffing campaigns over a number of years. To avoid a repeat of the problem, the 26 million ballots were evenly distributed to 75,000 retail outlets, and 150 minor and major league stadiums. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn also announced a special panel would be in place to review voting to determine if ballot stuffing had occurred.
American League roster.
The American League roster included 8 future "Hall of Fame players".
National League roster.
The National League roster included 13 future "Hall of Fame players and coaches" as well as all-time hits leader Pete Rose.
Starting lineups.
While the starters were elected by the fans, the batting orders and starting pitchers were selected by the managers.
Scoring summary.
Scoring opened in the top of the sixth inning for the AL, with Gaylord Perry pitching in relief for the NL. Ray Fosse singled, and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Sam McDowell. Two batters later, with one out, Carl Yastrzemski singled home Fosse to give the AL a 1-0 lead.
The American League added another run in the top of the seventh inning. With one out, Brooks Robinson singled. Tony Oliva walked, with Robinson advancing to second base. Davey Johnson singled to load the bases. Ray Fosse then hit a sacrifice fly, allowing Robinson to score, pushing the AL advantage to 2-0.
The NL answered in the bottom of the seventh inning. Jim Perry had entered to pitch in relief for the AL, and gave up a single to Bud Harrelson to start the inning. Cito Gaston walked, sending Harrelson to second base. Jim Perry then hit Denis Menke with a pitch to load the bases. Willie McCovey, pinch hitting for Gaylord Perry, grounded into a double play, permitting Harrelson to score and cutting the AL lead to 2-1.
The AL increased their lead in the top of the eighth inning. With one out, Carl Yastrzemski and Willie Horton hit back-to-back singles, putting runners at first and second bases. Amos Otis flew out, permitting Yastrzemski to tag up and move to third. Brooks Robinson tripled, scoring Yastrzemski and Horton. The AL now led 4-1.
In the bottom of the ninth inning, Catfish Hunter entered to pitch in relief for the AL, and promptly gave up a home run to Dick Dietz. Bud Harrelson singled. One batter later, with one out, Joe Morgan singled, sending Harrelson to second base. Fritz Peterson entered to relieve Hunter. The first batter he faced, Willie McCovey, singled, scoring Harrelson, and moving Morgan to third base. Mel Stottlemyre was sent in to relieve Peterson, as Roberto Clemente was sent to pinch hit for the pitcher, Bob Gibson. Clemente hit a sacrifice fly, permitting Morgan to score. The inning ended with Pete Rose striking out. The 4-4 score sent the game to extra innings.
In the bottom of the twelfth, NL batters were facing Clyde Wright, in his second inning of relief pitching for the AL. With two outs, Pete Rose and Billy Grabarkewitz hit back-to-back singles to put runners on first and second bases. Jim Hickman singled to Amos Otis in center field. Otis fired the ball to catcher Ray Fosse as Pete Rose ran past third base, heading to home. Otis' throw was on target on the third base side of home plate, and arrived as Rose reached Fosse. Rose bowled over Fosse, forcing him to drop the ball. Rose scored to end the game.
Game notes and records.
Claude Osteen was credited with the win. Clyde Wright was charged with the loss. Mel Stottlemyre, who permitted the tying run to score in the bottom of the ninth, was charged with a blown save.
Rico Carty became the first player in history to be elected to the All-Star team by the fans as a write-in candidate.
23 year old Ray Fosse suffered a fractured and separated left shoulder when Pete Rose collided with him on the last play of the game. The damage was not immediately noticed in X-rays taken that evening. While he continued playing for about a month, by his own admission, he never regained his swing and never returned to the level of play that he played at before the injury. In a 1999 "San Francisco Chronicle" interview, he demonstrated that he still could not lift his left arm, and suffers from arthritis as a result of the injury.
This was the NL's eighth consecutive win. The AL would end the streak next year.
Carl Yastrzemski tied the All-Star Game record for hits in a game (4), and singles in a game (3).
Carl Yastrzemski became the second and (as of 2008) last player to win the MVP award while playing for the losing team.
Prior to this year, the award given to the MVP of the game had been called the "Arch Ward Memorial Award". Starting this year, the award would be called the "Commissioner's Trophy". It would be restored to its original name in 1982 before being renamed for Ted Williams in 2002.

Western Australian state election, 1962

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 31 March 1962 to elect all 50 members to the Legislative Assembly. The Liberal-Country coalition government, led by Premier Sir David Brand, won a second term in office against the Labor Party, led by Opposition Leader Bert Hawke.
The election resulted in a confirmation of the status quo, with the only apparent seat changes since the 1959 election being due to the changes of affiliation of the two Independent Liberal members. Edward Oldfield, representing Mount Lawley, had joined the Labor Party during the previous term, whilst Bill Grayden, representing South Perth, had joined the Liberal Party. Both were re-elected. 
Two seats changed between the Country and Liberal Parties. In Avon, the sitting member James Mann (Liberal) retired after 32 years in Parliament, and Harry Gayfer, one of the two Country Party candidates, succeeded him in the seat. Meanwhile, in outer-metropolitan Darling Range, Liberal candidate Ken Dunn defeated the sitting Country member Ray Owen. The Labor candidate (Jack Metcalfe) narrowly won the primary vote, whilst Dunn polled one vote ahead of Owen, meaning Owen was eliminated and his votes distributed between Dunn and Metcalfe. A petition was filed and the Court of Disputed Returns ordered a fresh election for 22 July 1962, which widened the gap to 15 votes.

1995 Philadelphia Eagles season

The 1995 Philadelphia Eagles season was their 63rd in the league. The team improved upon their previous output of 7–9, going 10–6 under new head coach Ray Rhodes and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. 
It wasn't an auspicious start. Ricky Watters, signed as a free agent from the Super Bowl champion 49ers, infamously came up short on a pass over the middle in the Birds' season-opening 21–6 home loss to Tampa Bay. Following the contest, when asked why he didn't commit to catching the ball and taking a hit, he replied "For who? For what?"
Three weeks later, the Eagles were thumped by a 31-point margin against the Raiders in Oakland. However, the momentum swung in a positive direction after that, as Philly won four straight and seven of their next eight to get back in the playoff hunt.
On a frigid December 10 at the Vet against the Cowboys, the Eagles defense twice stopped Emmitt Smith on 4th-and-1 in Dallas territory late in the fourth quarter of a 17–17 tie. The change of possession resulted in the game-winning field goal from Gary Anderson and bragging rights forever. A win over Phoenix the next week clinched a playoff berth, but a loss at Chicago in the season finale on Christmas Eve torpedoed any hopes of an NFC East crown.
Off Season.
The Eagles' training camp was held for 16th and final year at West Chester University of Pennsylvania's John A. Farrell Stadium in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The camp was about 20 miles from their home stadium in south Philadelphia. In 1996 the Eagles would move to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania about 50 miles away.
NFL Draft.
The 1995 NFL Draft was held April 22–23, 1995. The league also held a supplemental draft after the regular draft and before the regular season.
With a 7–9 record in 1994, and tying with 4 other teams, the Eagles would rotate picking between the 8th pick to the 12th pick in the 7 rounds. They would choose 8 players in the 5 rounds they had picks.
The Eagles would make a trade with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, for Draft picks to move from 12th to 7th on the 1st round.
With their 1st pick in the draft, acquired from Tampa Bay, the Eagles chose Mike Mamula a Defensive End out of Boston College
The Cincinnati Bengals made a trade with the Carolina Panthers to get the overall 1st pick in the draft. They choose Ki-Jana Carter a Running Back that went to Penn State

List of Portuguese wine regions

Portuguese wine regions are grouped into three levels of classification. At the top are the "Denominação de Origem Controlada" (or DOCs) which are Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWpsr) under the European Union wine regulations and thus correspond roughly to the French "Appellation d'origine contrôlée" (AOC) and Spanish "Denominación de Origen" (DO) classifications. The second group consist of "Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada" (IPRs), and are also QWpsr. IPRs are used for DOC candidates "in training", and this level roughly corresponds to the French "Vin Délimité de Qualité Superieure" (VDQS) system. The final group are the Vinho Regional (VRs), which are table wines with a geographical indication under EU regulations. VRs each cover a larger area and are similar to the French "Vin de pays" at regional/departmental level.
The early 2000s has seen many changes in the classification and naming of Portuguese wine regions. Many previous IPRs have been elevated to DOC status, either on their own or to create a new, larger DOC from either IPRs or a mixture or smaller DOCs and IPRs. At the same time, the name of some VRs have been modified to allow them to be differentiated from some newly created DOCs which have taken over names of former VRs.
As of 2009, there were 26 DOCs for wine (not counting special designations and subregions), 4 IPRs and 11 VRs.

International Federation of Cheerleading

The International Federation of Cheerleading (IFC) was formed in 1998 and is a non-profit federation based in Tokyo, Japan and is the world governing body of Cheerleading. Its primary activities are organized through standing Commissions that are each responsible for some aspect of the development of cheerleading worldwide. The IFC sponsors a variety of international cheerleading competitions, including the Cheerleading World Championships.
History.
The IFC was formed in 1998 during the 3rd meeting between the European Cheerleading Association (ECA) and the Japan Cheerleading Association (JCA) on July 5, 1998 at the Sky Bridge Hotel in Malmo, Sweden.
At the Annual General Meeting in Oslo, Norway in 2006 the ICF members voted to change from ICF to IFC to disambiguate from the International Canoe Federation (ICF).
Objectives.
The objectives of IFC are to promote cheerleading worldwide, to spread knowledge of cheerleading and to develop friendly sporting relations among the member associations/federations.
Governance structure.
The IFC has an elected President, a Senior Vice-President, two Vice-Presidents, and other council members. Day-to-day operations of the IFC are the responsibility of the IFC Secretariat and Assistant to the Secretariat. Several standing commissions of the IFC are responsible for the development of cheerleading world-wide. These commissions include:
IFC Memberships.
IFC is open to all recognised national associations/federations controlling cheerleading at a national level. However, cheerleading organisations in countries or regions where there is no approved or recognised national association/federation in existence may also apply for membership.
Fundamentally, any applicant must be non-profit and only one member from each country or region may be affiliated, and such a member shall be recognized by the IFC as the only national governing body for all cheerleading in such a country or region.

Western Australian state election, 1959

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 21 March 1959 to elect all 50 members to the Legislative Assembly. The result was a hung parliament—the two-term Labor government, led by Premier Bert Hawke, was defeated with an average swing against it of about 7 per cent, but the Liberal-Country Party coalition, led by Opposition Leader David Brand, won exactly half of the seats, and needed the support of at least one of the two Independent Liberal members to obtain a majority in the Assembly. The situation remained precarious throughout the term—while Bill Grayden joined the Liberal Party the following year, giving the Coalition a one-seat majority, the other Independent Liberal, Edward Oldfield, joined the Labor Party.

Tom Pauken

Thomas Weir "Tom" Pauken (born January 11, 1944) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party.
Pauken is a former member and chairman of the Texas Workforce Commission. A former long-term resident of Dallas, who now resides in the resort community of Port Aransas in Nueces County on the Texas Gulf Coast, Pauken is a businessman, lawyer, and the author of two books. He served as chairman of the Texas Republican Party from 1994 to 1997 during the transition period when the party leaped quickly from minority to majority status at the statewide level. A staunch conservative, Pauken also served on President Ronald W. Reagan's White House staff.
On August 21, 2006, Governor Rick Perry named Pauken to chairman the Texas Task Force on Appraisal Reform (TFAR) to study and make recommendations on how to address Texans' continuing concerns over property appraisals. In March 2008, Perry appointed Pauken chairman of the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), which administers state unemployment compensation benefits, provides workforce development services, and maintains and issues state labor market data.
During his time as TWC chairman, which ended in May 2012, Pauken oversaw the development of the Texas Back to Work program and the Texas Veterans Leadership Program (TVLP).
He was a candidate for Governor of Texas, withdrawing early on.
Education and personal life.
Pauken was born on January 11, 1944 in Victoria, Texas. A graduate of the Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Pauken attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., from which he received his Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1965. From 1967 to 1970, he served in the United States Army, with a tour of duty in Vietnam. He obtained his Juris Doctor degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1973.
Pauken is married to Ida Ayala, and the couple has seven children: Thomas, Michelle, Angela, Elizabeth, Daniel, Monica, and Victoria. The Paukens are Roman Catholic.
Georgetown University, College Republicans, Vietnam.
Pauken entered Georgetown University in 1961 and became involved in politics as a "foot soldier in a small but growing conservative army" that was known for their support of the U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater. 
Pauken was elected national chairman of College Republicans and served from 1965 to 1967. The issue of the Vietnam War dominated his time as chairman; Pauken organized the bipartisan National Student Committee for the Defense of Vietnam. The group collected more than half a million signatures from students across the nation for a petition expressing support for American soldiers in Vietnam that was presented to Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. 
Upon completion of his term as the chairman of College Republicans, Pauken enlisted in the Army, because "I knew . . . I would be nothing but a hypocrite if I ducked my own obligation to serve." Pauken served as a military intelligence officer in Vietnam and returned to America at the end of December, 1969
Reagan White House.
Pauken was asked to serve on President Reagan's transition team after the 1980 election. On February 3, 1981, Pauken was nominated by Reagan to serve as director of the ACTION agency, now known as AmeriCorps. Under Pauken's leadership, the staff at ACTION was reduced from 1,000 to 500 and the budget was reduced 25%, from $160 million to $120 million. Pauken also ended ACTION's funding of liberal organizations, many of whom had ties to Saul Alinsky.
During his tenure at ACTION, Pauken established the Vietnam Veterans Leadership Program" an organization "created for Vietnam Veterans and led by Vietnam Veterans who were committed to helping our fellow veterans who were unemployed, underemployed, or who had lingering problems associated with their Vietnam experience." 
At ACTION, Pauken oversaw the implementation of the Just Say No to Drugs program in which Nancy Reagan served as chief spokeswoman. He was awarded the Ronald Reagan Medal of Honor by Reagan administration alumni. 
In 1985, Pauken left the Reagan administration to return to Texas to enter private business. He joined a Dallas-based venture capital company in 1986.
Chairmanship of the Texas GOP.
In 1994, Pauken was elected chairman of his state party organization with strong support from Reagan conservatives and social conservatives disenchanted with the so-called "stand-patism" and moderation of the outgoing chairman, Fred Meyer, an ally of former President George H. W. Bush. Pauken won the chairmanship by defeating a last-minute challenge waged by still serving U.S. Representative Joe Barton of Ennis, whose district at the time stretched from the Dallas southern suburbs to Bryan-College Station. 
During Pauken's tenure as chairman, the Republican Party gained majority status in Texas, and he was re-elected chairman in 1996. He chaired the Texas delegation to the Republican National Convention in 1996. 
The party continued to experience divisions between its establishment faction and its conservative wing. In 1996, Bill Price, a social conservative who had opposed Pauken when he ran for state chairman in 1994, led an effort to deny the naming of U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in San Diego, California, on the grounds that Hutchison is not pro-life. Pauken supported the selection of Hutchison as a delegate to the national convention, and she was elected a delegate at the state convention. The issue became divisive at the state convention even though Senator Robert Dole already had secured enough delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.
Chairmanship of Texas Workforce Commission.
Pauken served as chairman of Texas Workforce Commission from March 2008 through April 2012. Upon the completion of his tenure as chairman, Pauken remained at TWC as the commissioner representing employers. During his tenure he established the Texas Veterans Leadership Program (TVLP). TVLP is led and staffed by veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan and provides outreach to returning veterans from those wars aimed at helping the veterans to find employment. As of March 2012, about eight thousand returning veterans have received assistance from the program.
Pauken also initiated the creation of the Texas Back to Work program, which offers an incentive of up to $2,000 to employers for hiring qualified out-of-work Texans who lost their job through no fault of their own. More than 25,000 workers have obtained jobs through the program, which received the Unemployment Insurance Innovation Award for Reemployment in October 2010.
From the start of his tenure as chairman, Pauken has been a vocal advocate of the need to rebuild the American manufacturing industry and to place greater emphasis on the skilled trades, especially at the secondary school level.
Pauken announced his retirement from TWC effective March 1, 2013.
Political campaigns.
In 1978, Pauken challenged the freshman Democratic Representative Jim Mattox of Dallas for Texas' 5th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives, a position held by earlier Republicans Bruce Reynolds Alger and Alan Steelman. Mattox was assisted in his campaign by visits from President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalyn Smith Carter. Pauken offered a conservative alternative in sharp contrast to Mattox. The Democrat prevailed, with 35,524 votes (50.3 percent) to Pauken's 34,672 (49.1 percent). In their rematch in 1980, Pauken lost by 3,044 votes: 70,892 (51.0 percent) to 67,848 (48.8 percent). While Ronald Reagan was a winner in the Fifth District, he had no presidential coattails sufficient to lift Pauken to victory. Indeed, Pauken ran .3 of 1 percent below his initial 1978 showing.
After the congressional losses, Pauken joined the transition team of President-elect Reagan. After his tenure at ACTION and his return to Texas, Reagan called upon Pauken again on April 22, 1987, to become a director of the Inter-American Foundation.[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/042287d.htm]
In 2010, Pauken endorsed Perry for renomination in his successful race against Senator Hutchison and for reelection in the fall campaign against the Democrat Bill White, a former mayor of Houston, Texas. However, Pauken remained neutral in Perry's unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.
As book author.
Pauken is the author of two books, "The Thirty Year War: The Politics of the Sixties Generation" and "Bringing American Home: How America Lost Her Way and How We Can Find Our Way Back."
Published in 1995, "The Thirty Year War" is a memoir in which Pauken explains his involvement in politics beginning in the 1960s. The book traces Pauken's early interest in politics as a debater at Jesuit High School in Dallas; his time at Georgetown in which he was embroiled in the campus conflicts over the Vietnam War; his service in Vietnam and frustration with the execution of the war; his work for and ultimate disillusionment with the Richard M. Nixon White House, and his time in Reagan administration when he was director of ACTION. The noted conservative reporter and commentator Robert Novak, wrote in a forward to the book, that the "The Thirty Year War" demonstrates how "Pauken believes in what he says, and performs accordingly..." Novak concluded by writing that "Tom Pauken cherishes and nourishes the dangerous idea that the Republican Party should stand for something. He gives every indication that after fighting for 30 years, he is just getting his second wind."
In "Bringing America Home" (2010), Pauken outlines what he believes to be the causes of America's economic downturn, misguided foreign policy, and moral decline. Like the columnist and former presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan, Pauken places much of the blame on neoconservatives within the Republican Party leadership. He outlines a plan for addressing the nation's ills rooted in the Founding Fathers and traditional conservative principles. Booklist described the book as a "conservative manifesto of the highest caliber — humane, civilized, expressed by an active, living conscience." "Bringing America Home" argues that the George W. Bush presidential administration squandered the conservative political capital of the Goldwater-Reagan years.</ref>
As political commentator.
Pauken is a frequent political commentator on Texas radio stations and television programs in addition to regular speeches to civic clubs and conventions. He is also a guest opinion column contributor to several Texas newspapers and blogs. Pauken is a regular contributor to "Chronicles", a paleoconservative magazine published by the Rockford Institute in Rockford, Illinois.
On property taxation.
On April 26, 2006, Pauken endorsed the Texas Tax Reform Commission's plan for property tax relief and business tax reform. A portion of his statement follows:
"Those who know me know that I have never been shy about encouraging elected leaders to adhere to the Republican Party's conservative philosophy when dealing with the issue of taxes. As former chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, a former member of the Reagan administration and a conservative, grassroots activist for more than four decades, I have been unequivocal in my support for conservative tax reform, even if the byproduct is a few ruffled feathers. There is no doubt that, if this plan flouted conservative principles, I would be among the first to publicly call for its defeat. Instead, I am urging lawmakers to adopt this plan as soon as possible because it would be a tremendous victory for Texas homeowners and taxpayers. At the same time, this legislation encourages job creation and economic growth, particularly in the manufacturing sector." 
The proposal was adopted near the close of the special session of the Texas Legislature, which met a June 1, 2006, deadline, set by the Texas Supreme Court in regard to school funding.
On education reform.
In mid-2012, Pauken emerged as a leading opponent of Texas' current model of mandatory testing and college preparation. Pauken contended a system of “test learning” de-emphasizes a more wholistic educational approach and leads to a higher number of dropouts. He proposed a multi-pathway system by which high school students can learn career-centric math and science skills, while earning certifications and licenses in their preferred fields. Each pathway would lead to the same diploma, and college preparation would still be an emphasis for students who wish to pursue higher education.[http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20120808-editorial-academic-rigor-is-helping-students.ece] Several of these reforms appeared in the Pauken-supported Texas House Bill 5, which became law in June 2013.
Pauken said in an op-ed appearing in the "Texas Tribune": "For those on the career path, certification or licensure in their fields is the best way to show whether or not their education was successful. And for those going to a university, there is no reason we can’t use the same tests that universities use in determining admission, like the SAT or ACT. Performance measures ought to be tied to the actual outcomes that we seek for our students." [http://www.texastribune.org/texas-education/public-education/guest-column-schools-should-offer-multiple-paths/]
2014 gubernatorial campaign.
Pauken announced his gubernatorial candidacy on March 21, 2013.[http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/03/gop-stalwart-tom-pauken-to-run-for-governor-says-texas-needs-a-different-style-of-leadership.html] His decision to seek the governorship, he indicated, is not predicated on what other candidates may also enter the field, meaning Governor Perry, a potential candidate for reelection to a fourth full term, and Attorney General Greg Abbott, now in his third term in that position. Pauken said that he wants to end "crony capitalism" and repair long-term problems of public education.
"We just need a different style of leadership and a different approach to addressing the issues," Pauken said. He vowed to run a common-sense issues campaign, not one based on "consultant-driven sound bites".
He withdrew from the race on December 5, 2013, citing his "financial and organizational" difficulties and the lack of a "realistic path to victory".
Pauken supports term limits for state officials. and opposes the "Robin Hood" transfer of money from property-rich school districts to those with fewer resources. He claims that the state should make up the difference in funding between the wealthier and the poorer districts in a "revenue-neutral" fashion by replacing a portion of property taxes with consumption taxes or by expanding the sales tax. He supports expanded vocational education, greater local control of schools, and reduced emphasis on standardized testing.
Pauken said that when he ran for state GOP chairman in 1994, "We didn’t have much money and we had (political operative) Karl Rove against me and (U.S. Senator) Phil Gramm — the entire establishment — against us. And we won.
In 1998, the last time that Pauken sought elected office, he finished with 29.7 percent in a three-candidate field for the office of Texas attorney general. The winner of the primary runoff election was John Cornyn, the state's current senior U.S. senator and a candidate for reelection to a third term in 2014. Coincidentally, the Democrat that Cornyn defeated in the general election held on November 3, 1998, was former Attorney General Jim Mattox, the same candidate who had defeated Pauken for the Dallas-based congressional seat in 1978 and 1980.

Gas depletion

Gas depletion is the decline in gas production of a well, gas field, or geographic area.
Depletion "date".
According to the US Energy Information Administration, in 1980 the world had enough proved gas reserves to last 48 years at the 1980 rate of production. Cumulative world gas production from 1980 through 2011 was greater than the proved gas reserves in 1980. In 2011, world proved gas reserves were enough to last 58 years at 2011 production levels, even though the 2011 production rate was more than double the 1980 rate.
Role of new technology.
As new technologies for natural gas production are discovered, the world's ultimate reserves can grow. Although some predictions of ultimate reserve recovery include provisions for new technology, not every magnitude of breakthrough can be accurately accounted for.
More than half the increase in US natural gas production from 2006 to 2008 came from Texas, where production rose 15% between the first quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. This was mostly due to improved technology, which allowed the production of deepwater offshore and "unconventional" resources. An important new development was the horizontal drilling in a geologic formation known as the Barnett Shale, underlying the city of Fort Worth, which is a highly impermeable formation and difficult to produce by conventional means. The Barnett Shale now produces 6% of US natural gas. Other shale gas formations in the lower 48 states are widely distributed, and are known to contain large resources of natural gas.

Black Owl

The Black Owl is the name of two fictional superhero characters, one of which is the successor of the other. Both appeared in the Prize Publications title "Prize Comics" in the 1940s.
Fictional biography.
Doug Danville.
In 1940, Doug Danville, being a bored and wealthy playboy, decided to add meaning to his seemingly pointless life by fighting the criminal element hand to hand. Originally calling himself “K the Unknown,” he quickly changed his identity to that of The Black Owl. His original outfit was a tuxedo and an owl mask, but he soon switched to a blue and red costume.
At one point during his career, The Black Owl fought alongside The Green Lama, Yank & Doodle, and several other heroes to defeat Frankenstein's monster.
Finally, after more than three years of crimefighting, Danville decided to do something even more meaningful with his life; he joined the army and fought in World War II. Before leaving, he passed on the costume and identity of The Black Owl to Walt Walters. Whatever became of Danville after the war is not yet known.
Walt Walters.
Walt Walters was already indirectly connected to superheroing; his twin sons, Rick and Dick, were the costumed heroes Yank & Doodle. After Walt took up the mantle of The Black Owl in 1943, he and his sons worked as a team, with Rick and Dick essentially being his sidekicks.
In 1947, Walt suffered a bullet wound and found himself reconsidering being an active superhero; from that point on, he simply served as an adviser to Yank & Doodle. Whatever became of the three of them after the 1940s is not yet known.
History.
In 1940, Prize Publications, which was already established as a producer of pulp magazines, jumped onto the superhero bandwagon with a new title named "Prize Comics". The first issue featured a Batman-type hero named “K the Unknown,” whose name was changed to The Black Owl in issue #2 (April, 1940). In issue #24 (October, 1942), The Black Owl was part of a large crossover in which several heroes, including The Green Lama, fought together against the Frankenstein monster; the “team,” however, never got together again, and thus didn’t form a group like the Justice Society.
In issue #34 (September, 1943), the identity of The Black Owl was passed on from Doug Danville to Walt Walters, a character who was already established as the father of Yank & Doodle; the two series were merged. In issue #64 (June, 1947), the father was sidelined by means of a bullet, and the focus was almost entirely on Yank & Doodle.
With issue #69 (April, 1948), "Prize Comics" became "Prize Comics Western", and everything that didn’t fit the new Western format — including Yank, Doodle, and The Black Owl — was discarded. The three characters have since fallen into the public domain.
Modern Appearances.
In 2008, the online superhero fiction site Metahuman Press debuted the series "Living Legends" which featured the first Black Owl as part of its cast. The second Black Owl appeared briefly in "Fantastic Comics" #24, the first issue of the Next Issue Project. In issue #6 of "Project Superpowers", The Black Owl and Yank & Doodle were included in a two-page layout of Golden Age character sketches; In the one-shot "Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude", it was stated that the three of them would appear in the second volume of this comic title, and that The Black Owl (which one is not yet known) would be transformed into a living black hole.

Tucker Eskew

Tucker Eskew is a Republican political consultant in the United States who served as "chief of staff and permanent companion on the campaign trail" to Sarah Palin. He is the founding partner of the Eskew Strategy Group, an Alexandria based Republican communications firm. In 2005, he merged the Eskew Group into a new communications firm called ViaNovo. Other notable partners in ViaNovo include Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney 2004 campaign.
Background.
After graduating with a Political Science degree from the University of the South, Eskew began his career on President Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign. Tucker became a press secretary to South Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell at age 25. He served Campbell for eight years as Press Secretary and Communications Director. He worked closely with infamous GOP operative Lee Atwater, as seen in the political documentary . In the film, Tucker says “Can you understand American politics if you don’t understand Lee Atwater? I believe not.” In the mid-90s, he co-founded an electronic commerce business and later started a South Carolina-based public relations and business-consulting firm.
2000 George W. Bush campaign.
During the presidential primary campaign in 2000, Tucker directed South Carolina communications for George W. Bush in his hard-fought campaign against John McCain. A New York Times report on the South Carolina Republican primary described him as "Mr. Bush's spokesman here and a longtime political operative," quoting his pushback against crossover voters: "I think this alliance between the limousine-liberal Democrats and the McCain campaign is distorting the intent of real Republican voters."
According to ABC News, "When the media first reported push-poll phone calls from Voter/Consumer Research, a company hired by the Bush campaign, asking South Carolinians if they knew about McCain’s role in the S&L crisis and his scandal as a member of the Keating Five, it was Eskew -- Bush’s South Carolina spokesman – who acknowledged, and defended, the calls." 
After the Bush upset victory over McCain in South Carolina, Eskew became a top advisor to the Bush national campaign. He also served as spokesman for the Bush/Cheney recount committee in Florida.
George W. Bush administration.
After Bush took office in January, 2001, Eskew became the director of Bush's Office of Media Affairs at the White House, the number two public relations position under chief media chief Karen Hughes. But in November 2001, Eskew was moved to the Foreign Office in London to help plan media strategy in opposition to Osama bin Laden, " for the Coalition Information Centre, a three-pronged rebuttal and publicity operation based in Washington, London and Islamabad ... mainly driven by the US and UK."
2008 John McCain presidential campaign.
According to ABC News, Eskew was brought on board the McCain campaign to "help Palin prepare for her Wednesday night acceptance speech at the GOP convention and for her stump speech as she hits the road, brief her on policy matters, and help her handle the media scrutiny a lifetime in Alaska does not necessarily prepare one for." 
The Chicago Tribune (September 11, 2008) described Eskew as "a constant by Palin's side this week, as she has hopped between SUVs and campaign planes, all the while reading briefing materials or receiving quick tutorials from policy advisers who have dipped on and off the campaign trail to visit with her."

John Thomas David, Sr. (August 30, 1897–April 5, 1974), was from 1946 to 1955 the Democratic mayor of the small city of Minden, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana. After scandal forced him from the mayor's office, he remained the chief of the Minden Volunteer Fire Department (1934–1971) and served three terms from 1956 to 1968 on the Webster Parish Police Jury (the equivalent to county commission in other states). As mayor, David sought to increase available housing in the post-World War II era when military personnel returned home, married, and started families.
Mayoral tenure.
Mayor J. Frank Colbert, a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, did not seek reelection in 1946. David and three other candidates, insurance agent Castle O. Holland (1895–1981), former Mayor David William Thomas, and businessman Homer D. Acklen, hence entered the Democratic primary. Holland, who had been a member of the United States Marine Corps during World War I, was active in the American Legion, the Minden Chamber of Commerce, and the Lions Club. He was later named president of the former People's Bank and Trust Company in Minden. Holland led David in the primary by 19 votes, and the two entered a May 7 runoff election, in which David prevailed, 1,064-844.
Once in office, David and the new streets and parks commissioner, Jack Batton, later the mayor from 1978 to 1982, procured council passage of a plan to blacktop eight miles of dirt streets in the city. The project began with the link from Bayou Avenue to the Minden Cemetery. That initial phase was completed in three months.
In 1950, David narrowly won his third term as mayor in a runoff, again, against C. O. Holland, 1,172 to 1,039 votes. A 27-year-old attorney, A. Eugene Frazier, had been eliminated in the first round of primary voting. In 1952, David again was a narrow winner for another two-year mayoral term. In the primary, David led A. Eugene Frazier, who made a second mayoral bid, this time on a platform calling for fluoridation of municipal water, and another young lawyer, Henry Grady Hobbs (1923-2012), a Sarepta native who subsequently served eighteen years as the Minden city attorney. The tabulations were 1,257 to 1,171 to 296, respectively. In the runoff election on May 13, David defeated Frazier, 1,593 to 1,250.
On July 1, 1954, David was sworn into his fifth two-year term as mayor. He had defeated by 87 votes businessman and furniture store owner Paul Wallace (1896–1969), a former member of the Minden City Council. The tally in the April 6 Democratic primary was, 1,437 (51.6 percent) for David to 1,350 (48.4 percent) for Wallace. In his last successful race for mayor, David ran an advertisement in the local newspaper proclaiming himself as "Fair, Courteous, Impartial, Independent." David advocated a four-year term for the office of mayor, a change approved by the Louisiana State Legislature.
On February 23, 1955, David resigned as mayor when the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld his conviction of two misdemeanors for illegal liquor sales in his Minden drugstore, a common practice known as bootlegging in a prohibition city. Judge James E. Bolin, Sr., sentenced David to a $600 fine and 120 days at the Webster Parish Penal Farm. His resignation was confirmed in a February 23, 1955, letter to then Governor Robert F. Kennon, himself a former mayor of Minden. The penal farm is managed by the police jury, the body to which David was elected in 1956, 1960, and 1964. In his first term on the police jury, David served from the former Ward 4 with Leland G. Mims, W. Nick Love, and Claude R. Huckaby.
David served the second-longest tenure of any Minden mayor, surpassed only by Bill Robertson, who served from January 1991 until his death in office on June 27, 2013. 
David had been allied with pro-Long elements within the Democratic Party but had not been an open enemy of the hometown Governor Kennon, then a leader of the anti-Long faction of the dominant party. Anti-Long elements in Minden sought to remove David as mayor, and the state police raid which netted David in November 1954 proved fortuitous from their standpoint.
Paul Wallace ran in the special election to complete David's term but was again defeated. Businessman Jasper Goodwill prevailed over Wallace, 944 (52.4 percent) to 858 (47.6 percent).
On April 7, 1962, David attempted a comeback in the Democratic primary for mayor but lost to incumbent Frank T. Norman, 1,536 to 578. A third candidate, W. O. Cook, polled 236 votes.
Webster Parish Police Jury.
After he left the office of mayor, David served three terms on the parish police jury, but he was unseated in the Democratic runoff election held on December 16, 1967. James Tenney Branch, Jr. (1927-2010), a Minden businessman, polled 2,126 votes to David's 1,778 ballots. A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Branch was a graduate of Louisiana State University, a former president of the local American Legion, chairman of the Minden Medical Center board, and the 1984 Minden "Man of the Year". Branch was subsequently the police jury president and in 1982 an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Minden.Another candidate defeated in the police jury election that year was future long-term Minden Mayor Bill Robertson.
Personal life.
In addition to his David Drugs, he operated David Furniture in Minden and was part-owner with Harold Martin Turner (1911–1988) of the former Southern Kitchen Restaurant in Minden. He was a founding member of the Emmanuel Baptist Church, which was organized in 1959 near the David home on the Homer Road in Minden through the work of the Reverend T. W. Leachman. David and his wife, the former Irma Mizell (February 5, 1903—September 29, 1989), a native of Heflin in south Webster Parish, had a son, John T. David, Jr. (November 12, 1922—September 15, 1991), a corporal in World War II.
John David, Jr., and wife, Yvonne David, had four children, Mayor David's grandchildren: Johnny Ross David (born 1943), Dinah David Garcia (born 1947), Sally Irene David (born 1957), and Joe David, and six great-grandchildren. He also had two brothers, Larkin C. David (February 16, 1902—July 12, 1988) and J. B. David, and five sisters. John David's niece, Leatrice David West, was the daughter-in-law of Minden department store owner H.O. West. David died in Minden Medical Center and was interred in the family plot at the Minden Cemetery.

Stockbridge Militia

The Stockbridge Militia was a military unit from Stockbridge, Massachusetts which served in the American Revolutionary War. The militia was composed of American Indians, mostly Mahican, Wappinger, and Munsee from the Stockbridge area. While most northeastern tribes, such as Joseph Brant's Mohawks, aligned themselves with the British, the Stockbridge tribes cast their lot with the colonies. Led by Jehoiaikim Mtohksin and Abraham Nimham, it was the first native unit to fight against the British during the revolution.
Early history.
In 1774, as the revolution began to get under way in Massachusetts, members of the Stockbridge tribes met at the Red Lion Inn to pledge their loyalty to the American cause:Wherever your armies go, there we will go; you shall always find us by your side; and if providence calls us to sacrifice our Lives in the field of battle, we will fall where you fall, and lay our bones by yours. Nor shall peace ever be made between our nation and the Red-Coats until our brothers -the white people- lead the way.
This first incarnation of the militia served at the Siege of Boston and the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. This militia disbanded soon thereafter, with some Indians returning to their homes and others continuing to serve as scouts for various units. 
In 1777, a new militia was gradually formed as Stockbridge men from the 8th Massachusetts Regiment, Nixon's Brigade, and other units gathered under the command of Major General Horatio Gates. This new, loosely-organized Stockbridge Militia, now part of the Continental Army, was led by Jehoiaikim Mtohksin. Abraham Nimham, son of famed sachem Daniel Nimham, joined the unit as Mtohksin's second-in-command. From 1777 to 1778 they participated in the Siege of Ticonderoga, the Battle of Saratoga, and the Battle of Monmouth.
The Stockbridge Massacre.
In August 1778, the Stockbridge Militia was stationed at an outpost in what is now Yonkers, New York. Their opposition came mainly from the Queen's Rangers, a unit descended from Rogers' Rangers, in which many Stockbridge had served during the French and Indian War. 
On August 31, nearly forty Indians—including Abraham Nimham, his father Daniel, and twelve other Stockbridge natives—were killed in an ambush by the Rangers in the area of The Bronx that is now Van Cortlandt Park. Lieutenant colonel John Graves Simcoe led the British attack; although he was wounded along with several others, the skirmish was a decisive British victory. After the fighting, Hessian captain Johann Von Ewald sketched a Stockbridge warrior based on one of the dead who had been left behind. The picture is the only known contemporary depiction of a Revolutionary-era Stockbridge militiaman. Von Ewald described the Indian casualties after his examination:
Their costume was a shirt of coarse linen down to the knees, long trousers also of linen down to the feet, on which they wore shoes of deerskin, and the head was covered with a hat made of bast. Their weapons were a rifle or musket, a quiver with some twenty arrows, and a short battle-axe, which they know how to throw very skillfully. Through the nose and in the ears they wore rings, and on their heads only the hair of the crown remained standing in a circle the size of a dollar-piece, the remainder being shaved off bare. They pull out with pincers all the hairs of the beard, as well as those on all other parts of the body.
The bodies of the Indians were left on the battlefield. Soon after, local residents discovered the corpses being scavenged by dogs, and they buried them in a mass grave. By the 19th century the spirit of their sachem was said to haunt the land of "Indian Field".
End of service.
That engagement was the last of the war for the militia; Abraham's father, Daniel Nimham, was a man of great standing among the Wappinger, and the other casualties represented a significant loss to the total population of the tribe back in Massachusetts. Requesting leave to return home to help the families of the dead, the company was paid $1,000.00 for their service and discharged by order of George Washington in September 1778.
After the war, the militia saw brief action once more as they defended Stockbridge from insurgents during Shays' Rebellion. It has been suggested that their service created strong support for Indian suffrage in the new Commonwealth of Massachusetts; although article five of the first draft of the state's new constitution excluded Indians as eligible voters, it was soundly defeated and the second draft gave all men the right to vote.
Most of the Indian survivors eventually settled in Oneida County, New York and were later moved to Wisconsin, forming the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe.

Andrieu Contredit d'Arras

Andrieu Contredit d'Arras ("c."1200–1248) was a trouvère from Arras and active in the Puy d'Arras. "Contredit" is probably a nickname. He wrote mostly "grand chants", but also a "pastourelle", a "lai", and a "jeu-parti" with Guillaume li Vinier. 
Andrieu is probably the "Andreas Contredit, miles ministerellus, crucesignatus" who in 1239, according to French royal documents, joined the Crusade of Theobald I of Navarre as a knight and minstrel. His appearance in royal documents may indicate his service (probably as a minstrel) to Louis IX, and he addressed his song "Au mois d'avril" to Louis. 
His song "Ja pour nul mal" was addressed to the Puy. One of the most important sources on his life is the register of the Puy. It records his death at Arras in 1248 and the death of his wife in 1225. Besides the register of the Puy are Andrieu's poems themselves, since he wrote twenty and named himself as author in fourteen. He addressed "Bone, bele et avenans" to a "Marote", probably fellow trouvère Maroie de Diergnau de Lille. He praised the city of Arras in "L'autrier quant je chevauchoie". Andrieu twice refers to himself as "messire" (mister), a title reserved for nobility. His blason had once decorated chansonnier known as MS 844 in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, but it has now been lost. 
Andrieu's verses show little variation of form. They all begin with the same rhyme scheme (ABAB), all are in regular metre, and all use the same few lengths of line. Andrieu's music is more varied, though it is all in bar form. The melodies are frequently non-repetitive and sometimes motivic.

John Mauran

John Lawrence Mauran, FAIA (1866, Providence, Rhode Island – 1933) was an American architect responsible for many downtown landmarks in St. Louis, Missouri, and also active in Wisconsin and Texas. 
Life.
Mauran studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1885 through 1889 under the French-American educator Eugene Letang, and entered the Boston office of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge as a young draftsman. There he helped design the 1893 Chicago Public Library (now the Chicago Cultural Center) and the 1894 Art Institute of Chicago. 
Sent by the firm to establish a branch office in St. Louis, his employers closed shop there in 1900 and Mauran formed his own partnership, Mauran, Russell & Garden, which evolved into Mauran, Russell & Crowell in 1911. The firm carved out a niche designing Carnegie libraries in towns in Missouri, Wisconsin, and Kansas. Mauran had also married a local socialite, Isabel Chapman, in 1899, which aided his social connections, bringing commissions for local churches, office buildings, and a number of sizable mansions in St. Louis's new private places. He himself lived at #40 Vandeventer Place, on the most prestigious street in the city. 
From 1902 Mauran became a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and was appointed by Theodore Roosevelt to the first United States Commission of Fine Arts in 1910. In 1915 he was elected President of the AIA; in 1925 he served as head of the St. Louis Memorial Plaza Commission. Mauran died unexpectedly after an appendicitis attack in 1933, at the family's summer home in New Hampshire. 
Work.
Stylistically versatile through its decades of activity, Mauran's office was more commercially than artistically oriented, with work concentrated in the St. Louis area and a large number of hotel commissions in Texas. The St. Louis high-rises of the 1900s and 1910s show a clear influence from the Sullivan skyscrapers they stand next to, like the Wainwright Building, without Sullivan's distinctive ornament. 
The stripped-classical style of the St. Louis Soldiers' Memorial, in 1939 a late example of its kind, is appropriate for its civic presence. Like other public buildings in the downtown Civic Plaza, the initial plans were far more elaborate, before delay and budget pressures left the actual results simplified and scaled down. 
W.O. Mullgardt joined the firm in 1930. When Mauran died in 1933, this left William Crowell as its principal designer. The modernist 1941 Post-Dispatch Printing Plant, with its long ribbons of windows, anticipated other International Style buildings in St. Louis by about nine years. This was the firm's final major work.
Work.

Modelhouse

Namuna Ghar (The Model House) in Bhaktapur is a typical traditional Newari house, which had been neglected for a long time, until Mr. Rabindra Puri decided to buy and renovate it. Having a great passion for Newari architecture, Mr. Puri believed that he needed to set an example in order to convince other home owners to restore their houses, rather than to demolish and rebuild.
The house was in a very bad state. Nobody lived in the house for ten years and there were rumors that the house was haunted. It was used as a chicken farm for the last five years before it was restored. When the restoration work started certain elements were found which indicated the house to be about 150 years old.
The house has been restored in its original shape, reusing most of the materials. The weakest part of the house had to be demolished and rebuilt in traditional style. It was a major challenge to save all the wooden frames, windows and bricks. Only a few materials and materials for modern facilities, like the bathroom, are new. For the interior decoration traditional and local materials were used. The restoration methodology was totally traditional. Some modern earthquake resistant measures were also adopted.
The area of the project is 259.21 square meters but the house is built in an area of 84.8 square meters and there is a garden and a lawn in front of the house. The total cost in restoring the house is 17,000 $U.S. which was financed by its owner.
The house was reconstructed in a time span of about a year and a half. The construction work was started in September 1999 and it was completed in March 2001.
Awards and Appreciation.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO has recognized the outstanding restoration of Namuna Ghar, Bhaktapur at a ceremony held on October 24, 2005. The conservation of this private building was awarded an Honorable Mention in the 2004 annual UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards.The head of the UNESCO Office in Kathmandu, Ms. Koto Kanno, presented the award to Mr. Rabindra Puri, owner of the Namuna Ghar.
Total of 37 entries were received on 2004 from 12 countries and administrative areas in the Asia-Pacific region. A variety of types of projects were submitted for the Awards, including: seven religious buildings, fourteen institutions, eight residential buildings, three commercial projects, three urban conservation programs, and two cultural landscapes.
The house became so popular in such a short time that in June 2001 the house was declared a model house from the Bhaktapur Municipality. The appreciations and success of the project were proven by the visitors of the house (thousands), articles written by almost all the newspaper of Nepal and 5 different documentary films shown by Nepal Television and Channel Nepal as well as by an Indian Channel called B4U Music.
Summary.
Namuna Ghar set an example that one could maintain the ancient architectural method building a house using modern amenities without destroying its ancient looks and values. Many foreigners as well as Nepalese people come to visit the house, making the house more or less like a museum. Exhibitions and cultural events are also organized in the house. The house's guest room is used by scholars who come to Bhaktapur for studies and research.

Heinrich Kroll

Oberleutnant Henrich Claudius Kroll (3 November 1894–21 February 1930) Pour le Merite, Knight's Cross of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern, Saxony's Albert Order Knight Second Class with Swords, Iron Cross First and Second Class, was a World War I fighter ace credited with 33 victories.
Early life.
Kroll was born in the village of Flatzby near Flensburg, Germany, the son of a school teacher. Kroll the younger also aspired to become a teacher. He passed his examinations at Kiel and was being credentialed as a teacher when World War I started. He was also active in athletics as a member of the Kiel sports club.
He volunteered for service in the "Queen Augusta Victoria" infantry regiment, Fusilier Regiment No. 86, in Flensburg, on 6 August 1914. From there he transferred into Reserve Regiment No. 92. He was in heavy fighting around Hartmannswillerkopf in Alsace, the battle for which began on 31 December 1914. He earned an Iron Cross Second Class, and was commissioned an officer in May 1915.
He then applied for a transfer to the Air Service in January 1916.
Aerial Service.
Kroll trained with Replacement Division 3 at Gotha. From there he went to FA 17 based at Rethel, France, to fly the Rumpler C.I. He was the only officer pilot in FA 17; commonly, in these early days of aviation reconnaissance the observer was an officer and the pilot a non-commissioned "chauffeur". Following this practice, Kroll's observer was Lieutenant Holzhausen.
In October, 1916, two new Albatros fighters were assigned to the unit, and Kroll started flying one occasionally. The unit was reorganized into Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 9, operating Fokker E.IIIs.
In November 1916 he was posted to Jasta 9. On 12 February 1917, Kroll was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. It was about this time that Kroll wrote about the difficulty of confirming victories: "It is difficult to get confirmation of a victory–especially the first one! It must be confirmed by our own ground troops...this is even more difficult if hazy conditions prevail."
After being shot down and forced to land by a Caudron in November 1916, Kroll's first victory was on 1 May 1917, over a Spad. He downed four more Spads in May, his fifth victory being one of the most significant victories; on 25 May 1917, he shot down and killed the man who was then the second highest scoring ace in the French Air Force, René Dorme. As Kroll's diary related, the two pilots had locked in a circling dogfight beginning at 5300 meters (about 17,400 feet) and devolving down to 800 meters (about 2600 feet). Dorme's Spad suddenly nosed over and barreled straight into the ground, bursting into flames upon impact. Dorme's body was so disfigured it could only be identified by his watch.
This victory was influential in Kroll being appointed commanding officer of Royal Saxon Jasta 24 on 1 July 1917. He would command this unit, with brief interregnums, until just before the end of the war.
He would score once in July, on the 20th.
On 27 July he was shot down in flames by Captain Clive W. Warman of No 23 Squadron, but escaped uninjured. Warman's machine gun fire set Kroll's airplane's carburettor on fire, but Kroll killed the engine to starve the flames, tore off his oily goggles so he could still see, and landed dead stick, trailing telephone wires.
On 27 September 1917 with his score at 12, he received the first Pfalz D.III assigned to his Jasta. The Pfalz would almost end his life. Kroll apparently still used his Albatros D.V, marked with a taijitu on a tan background. Kroll considered the Pfalz to be the Albatros's inferior in performance; He thought the Pfalz the slower of the two planes, climbed no better, but could be faster in a dive. Whichever aircraft he used, he rounded off 1917 by scoring his 15th victory on 4 December.
On 25 January 1918, after he shot down a Bristol F.2b Fighter for number 17, the rear spar of the Pfalz he was flying broke, and the left aileron tore badly, almost separating from the plane. It took all Kroll's skill to land safely. His complaint to higher authorities gained him a promise of three Fokker Dr.Is for his Jasta, but nothing else. He and his Jasta would have to suffer with Pfalzes until the new Fokker D.VII arrived on 28 May.
His 20th victory on 18 February brought an award of the Knight's Cross of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern and made him eligible for the Pour le Merite. The "Blue Max" duly arrived on 29 March 1918.
On 25 May, his Jasta finally received Fokker D.VIIs. At about this time, Kroll also became the commander of Jagdgruppe 12, which consisted of his Jasta 24, and Jastas 44 and 79b. Kroll continued as Jasta 24's leading ace, steadily racking up his score, mostly against enemy fighters. An SE-5a fell on 9 August 1918 to finish his tally at 33.
On 14 August 1918 he was so seriously wounded in the left shoulder that he never flew in action again.
The 28 victories he scored with Jasta 24 made up almost a third of its 90 claims; he and Friedrich Altemeier combined for over half the squadron wins. Despite being handicapped by the poorly built Pfalz, the Jasta under Kroll's leadership had suffered only 15 casualties. Most striking of all, only four of Kroll's victims had been two seater reconnaissance aircraft. Kroll shot down about as many enemy fighters as his more famous compatriot, Manfred von Richthofen.
Post war.
The end of the war saw him an Oberleutnant. He then joined the Hamburg Police as a captain. While there he witnessed the attempted Kapp Putsch against the Weimar government. In its aftermath he recovered the body of fellow fighter ace Rudolf Berthold, who had been murdered by German communists.
There followed a quiet period during which he was a clerk.
He joined the Hamburg Flying Club in 1928 and reclaimed his pilot's license. He flew pioneer commercial aviation routes to Berlin and to the northern islands. He also used a Junkers F 13, which was the first all-metal civil aviation craft, for sightseeing flights over Hamburg.
He died of pneumonia on 21 February 1930 and was buried in Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.
The Luft Hansa later named one of its Junkers 52/3m transports HEINRICH KROLL (D-AHUS,W.Nr.4049) to honour him.

Giovanni Canestrini (December 26, 1835 – February 14, 1900) was an Italian naturalist and biologist who was a native of Revò. 
He initially studied in Gorizia and Meran, then furthered his education in natural sciences at the University of Vienna. From 1862 to 1869, he was a lecturer at the University of Modena, and in 1869 became a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Padua. 
In 1862 he founded the "Società dei Naturalisti Modenesi" (Modena Society of Naturalists), and in 1871, the "Società Veneto-Trentina di Scienze Naturali" (Trento-Venetian Society of Natural Sciences). He is credited with establishment of the bacteriology laboratory at Padua.
Canestrini made contributions in several biological disciplines, performing important research in the field of acarology. He was an advocate of Darwinism, and was responsible for translating Darwin's works into Italian. Through these translations, Canestrini was a principal factor concerning the popularity of Darwinism in 19th century Italy. During his career he was the author of almost 200 scientific publications.

New South Wales 43 class locomotive

The 43 class were a class of Australian diesel locomotives built by A Goninan & Co, Broadmeadow for the New South Wales Government Railways in 1956/57.
Construction.
The class of six locomotives was built by A Goninan & Co, Broadmeadow, as sub-contractor to Australian Electrical Industries.
These locomotives were unique in Australia in having Alco power units in GE Transportation Systems designed bodies, a legacy of the former Alco-GE partnership which was dissolved in 1953. Although their design originated in the United States, only two similar UM20 cab and two booster units were ever built in that country, for the Erie Railroad.
Operation.
The 43 class were initially used on the Main Western line from Sydney to Orange, prior to electrification of the line to Lithgow in June 1957, appearing regularly on the "Central West Express". Subsequently, they were transferred to Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot operating from Gosford to the Queensland border via both the North Coast and Main North lines. They also saw service on the Main South line.
The 43 class were not popular with the train crews, but they did pave the way for a long line of Alco powered locomotives. They did receive some improvements in the late 1950s with water cooling of the turbo-superchargers replacing the air-cooled units.
Demise.
In August 1974 4301 was taken into Chullora Workshops for a regular overhaul, however a decision was made to use it as spares for the remaining units.
The last was withdrawn in October 1979 with 4306 placed by the Public Transport Commission in the custody of the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. It is now a designated NSW heritage item. It was transferred to Thirlmere in March 1980. In 1986 the Illawarra branch of the Rail Transport Museum commenced overhauling 4306 at Yallah. The locomotive returned to traffic in June 1996 and has since been used extensively on charters in New South Wales as well as interstate to Brisbane and Melbourne.

1961 NFL Expansion Draft

The 1961 NFL Expansion Draft was a National Football League (NFL) draft in which a new expansion team, named the Minnesota Vikings, selected its first players. That selection was provided by the expansion draft, held on January 26, 1961.
In August 1959, a group of Minneapolis businessmen were awarded a franchise in the new American Football League (AFL). In January 1960, they forfeited their AFL membership and were awarded a 90% stake in the 14th franchise of the NFL (the other 10%, under a decades-old agreement, went to former Duluth Kelleys/Eskimos owner Ole Haugsrud). Though the ownership group had participated in the 1960 American Football League Draft before jumping leagues to the NFL, they did not take any of the players they selected in that draft with them. As such, they entered the 1961 draft with an empty roster. So that the Vikings could become competitive with existing teams, the league awarded the Vikings the first pick in the 1961 NFL Draft and gave them the opportunity to select current players from existing teams. In the expansion draft, the existing franchises listed players from which the Vikings could select to switch to the new team.
Rules of the Draft.
Every existing NFL team except the Dallas Cowboys listed eight of its thirty-eight players, and the Vikings selected three players on the list from each team.

Fountain of Qasim Pasha

The Fountain of Qasim Pasha () also known as the Fountain of the Bitter Orange ("al-Naranj Sabil") is an ablution and drinking fountain located in the western esplanade of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is situated in front of the Chain Gate. 
History.
The fountain was built by Qasim Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Jerusalem in 1527 during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, making the first public structure to be built on the Haram al-Sharif/ Al-Aqsa Mosque by the Ottomans. Earlier Ottoman works on the site were not the construction of newer buildings but the restoration of the walls. 
A wooden colonnade was added to protect the benches and steps surrounding the Fountain of Qasim Pasha from rain and the summer-time sun in the 1920s restoration by the Supreme Muslim Council. The Dome was rebuilt during the restoration, and covered with lead panels that bestowed upon it a pointed shallower profile. In 1998, the lead sheeting was replaced by a finely crafted stone.
Architecture.
The fountain consists of an octagonal building over a cistern, around which is a wooden shelter that protects worshippers from the sun and the rain while performing ablution. There are eight water taps at the fountain, one on each side of the octagon, which are still used for ablution. The fountain structure, enclosing a cistern, is sunk about one meter below the Al-Aqsa Mosque platform. The structure is preceded by a square shallow pool, with marble paving and a modern fountain in its center. The dome of the structure is built atop an octagonal drum.

America's Toughest Jobs

"America's Toughest Jobs" is a reality television show that lasted one season and aired on the American television network NBC. It pitted contestants against each other as they attempted a series of difficult and dangerous jobs. The prize was the sum of the salaries that would be earned by people doing these jobs in their first year.
The show's creator and executive producer was Thom Beers, notable for creating shows such as "Deadliest Catch" and "Monster Garage". Some of the jobs he chose to be featured on "America's Toughest Jobs" were featured on shows he previously created. The host was Josh Temple, a character actor who had minor roles in shows such as "Will & Grace" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm".
In each episode, contestants took part in tasks associated with a job, and were supervised and evaluated by workers or employers in that business. After spending time on the job, the supervisors selected one or more top employees for praise, and selected the employees who had the worst performances (the bottom four in the first five episodes, and the bottom two thereafter). Those employees were required to compete head-to-head in an additional challenge to determine who would be eliminated. For example, in the gold digging episode, the bottom four contestants were required to spend additional time digging for gold with the contestant who found the least amount eliminated. Once there were four contestants remaining, timed challenges were held for three of the season's toughest jobs with the contestant who had the slowest time at each eliminated until a winner was determined. At the end of each episode, an information screen was shown that detailed what the eliminated contestant decided to do after the show.
Ben Coleman was named the winner of season one on October 25, 2008. The results were accidentally posted on NBC's website several hours before the show aired.
On March 13, 2009, it was confirmed that the series had been canceled and would not be returning for a second season.

<doc id="19505008" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19505008" title="History of Partick">
History of Partick

This article deals with the history of the Partick area of Glasgow in Scotland.
Etymology of Partick.
The place name "Partick" is derived from the Cumbric word for 'thicket'. This etymology reflects the fact that the inhabitants of the Glasgow/Strathclyde region were speakers of this Old Welsh dialect. Gaelic only became of predominant in this area with the waning and disappearance of the British Kingdom of Alt Clut/Strathclyde, perhaps in the eleventh century.
Dark Ages Royal centre.
There is some evidence that Partick was an important centre for the Kings of Alt Clut/Strathclyde. According to the Cistercian monk and hagiographer of St Kentigern, Jocelin of Furness, King Rhydderch had a residence in 'Pertnech' (Partick). Some archaeologists have deduced that the royal Partick estate was part of a larger elite centre of the kingdom, which included the ecclesiastical establishment just across the River Clyde at Govan. Partick and Govan may have come to prominence as a political centre following the Vikings' sack of Dumbarton in 870. 
The lands of Partick remained royal property until King David granted them to the Bishops of Glasgow on the cathedral's dedication to Saint Kentigern, along with the lands of Govan.
Bishop's Residence.
From the time of King David's grant of land to the Bishops of Glasgow, the country residence of the Bishops of Glasgow was situated in Partick. This is supported by the existence of a deed of 1277 in which Maurice, Lord of Luss made a contract at "Perthec" for the sale of timber to the authorities at Glasgow Cathedral. 
The Bishops' residence is depicted on the former Burgh of Partick's coat of arms as a castle. In 1362, a settlement of a dispute between the Bishop and his chapter house was made at his "manor-house of Perthic". Glasgow's Bishops continued to use their residence in Partick until the reformation in 1560, when Bishop James Beaton II fled to France from there, taking with him the sacred relics from Glasgow Cathedral.
The Reformation and after.
After the reformation in 1560, ownership of the lands returned to the Scottish Crown. From that time on to the nineteenth century, Partick was part of Govan parish and therefore in Renfrewshire. The boundary between Glasgow and Partick was the River Kelvin (but with a small area over the river at Pointhouse also in Partick).
Partick was the main crossing point of the River Kelvin for the road between Glasgow and Dumbarton. From earliest times, the river was crossed by a ford. Later came a wooden bridge for foot passengers. It is commonly thought that the first permanent stone bridge over the river was built by Captain Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill, who was Provost of Glasgow at the start of the seventeenth century.
The building known as Partick Castle lay close to Partick's original ford. It was built by the Glasgow benefactor, George Hutcheson, and was derelict by the late eighteenth century.
Milling Centre.
Partick remained a relatively small village until the early nineteenth century. The steep drop of the River Kelvin between what is now Glasgow's Botanic Gardens and the river's mouth, led to Partick becoming an important centre of milling, especially grain milling. While Glasgow's Molendinar Burn powered a few mills during the medieval period, its flow was insufficient for the needs of the growing burgh, perhaps as early as the twelfth century. So the city came to depend on the rapidly flowing River Kelvin for its milling as well as two other locations: Bedlay (Cadder) and Clydesmill (Carmyle).
Records of Partick as a milling centre go back to the Middle Ages. A prophecy of Thomas the Rhymer (thirteenth century) predicts:
'you may walk across the Clyde on men's bodies, and the miller of Partick Mill ("muileann Pearraig"), who is to be a man with seven fingers will grind for two hours with blood instead of water.'
Before the reformation, the inhabitants of Glasgow used to grind their grain at either the Town Mill of Partick or at a nearby small mill belonging to Glasgow's Archbishop. 
By 1820, Partick was a major milling centre, with several located in its vicinity. These included: the Old Mill (on the site of the building now known as the Bishop's Mill), the Slit Mill, the Archbishop's Mill (later Bunhouse/Regent Mill), the Waulk Mill (now Scotstoun Mill) and the Wee Mill. A little way upstream of Partick, there was also Clayslaps Mill (just below what is now Kelvingrove Museum & Art Gallery). Such a concentration of mills eventually resulted in the Clyde Navigation Trust building its colossal granaries at Meadowside in Partick in 1911–1913 (with subsequent extensions in 1936, 1960 and 1967). These were demolished in 2004 to make way for the Glasgow Harbour residential development
Of Partick's mills, only Scotstoun Mill, now owned by Rank Hovis MacDougall, is still in operation.
Nineteenth Century Development.
During the nineteenth century Partick developed from a small village into a relatively populous centre as a result of the fast pace of industrial development along the River Clyde and improving communications. The table below summarises the population of the Burgh of Partick during the nineteenth century:
The development of the Clydeside ship building industry, in particular, gave momentum to Partick's rapid expansion. This in turn was made possible by the steady canalisation of the River Clyde between 1773 and 1830's, which deepened and narrowed the river, to make it navigable by large ships. Canalisation also created 'firmer' banks along great stretches of the River Clyde, enhancing the prospect of their industrial development. In 1844 Messrs David Tod & John McGregor moved their shipbuilding operation from Govan to Partick. In 1858 a major step for their enterprise, was the opening of a new graving dock at their Meadowside site. Subsequently, several other shipyards opened along the north bank of the Clyde, including one directly across the mouth of the River Kelvin at Pointhouse (in 1845). Further west along the River Clyde, Barclay Curle's shipyard opened in 1855, precipitating the rapid development of the Whiteinch area. This was followed by the opening of Connell's shipyard (1861) and the Yarrow shipyard (1906) both yet further west in Scotstoun.
The transport of people and goods along the north bank of the River Clyde (between residential and industrial areas) was facilitated by the construction of the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway, which opened in stages between 1894 and 1896.
A Police Burgh.
The Police of Towns (Scotland) Act, 1850 (Lock’s Act) made it easier for Police Burghs to be created. Any “populous place” from this time on was able to adopt a police system and become a burgh.
The pressures caused by Partick's very rapid demographic and industrial expansion proved to be too much for the village's mid-nineteenth century infrastructure. In June 1852, at a public meeting, the householders of Partick agreed to constitute themselves into a Police Burgh to remedy a range of common concerns including:
...the defective state of the drainage, the disrepair of the streets and roads, the number and increase of nuisances in the locality, and the inability of the inhabitants to either to compel a proper and efficient system of drainage or to control or abate any nuisance, or to make any sanitary or other regulations for the well being of the community... 
Twelve householders were elected as Commissioners. From among them, the shipbuilder David Tod was elected Partick's first Provost. According to the contemporary local historian, James Napier, these Commissioners (including himself) acted immediately:
The Commissioners now began to carry out a system of drainage and other sanitary measure with considerable promptitude, and, as the following facts show to great advantage. The first three years after 1854, the average death rate was 34.5 per 1000 of the population; the average of the last three years ("he was writing in 1875"), including 1872, is 21 per 1000 of the population, showing a saving of many hundred of lives to the community.
By 1853, the Commissioners had built a small adminsistrative building for the Burgh in a palazzo style. This eventually became Partick's police building which can still seen in Anderson Street (though Partick's Police Station has now been moved to the Thornwood stretch of Dumbarton Road). In 1872, the larger Partick Burgh Halls were built (in a Francois I style) to a design by William Leiper.
In 1912, the Burgh of Partick ceased to exist having been incorporated into the ever expanding Glasgow Corporation. A contemporary account relates:
While the Burgh Organist played "Lochaber no More", the Provost's chain of office was removed from his neck, and as his robe was laid aside the Provost said, "There they lie, the abandoned habits of the Provost of Partick, taken from him by Act of Parliament."
List of Provosts of Partick.
Partick's last Provost was born in Markinch, Fife on 8th Jan 1855 to Robert Brown and Mary Stark; the 4th of 7 children.

Matrix clock

A matrix clock is a mechanism for capturing chronological and causal relationships in a distributed system.
Matrix clocks are a generalization of the notion of vector clocks. A matrix clock maintains a vector of the vector clocks for each communicating host.
Every time a message is exchanged, the sending host sends not only what it knows about the global state of time, but also the state of time that it received from other hosts.
This allows establishing a lower bound on what other hosts know, and is useful in applications such as checkpointing and garbage collection.

Tule Springs Archaeological Site

Tule Springs Archaeological Site is an archeological site listed on the National Register of Historic Places that is located in the Las Vegas Valley of Nevada. It is one of a few sites in the United States where humans were once thought to have lived alongside, and potentially hunted, extinct Ice Age megafauna, although this view is not supported by the available scientific data and is no longer generally accepted.
The archeological site is marked as Nevada Historical Marker 86 and is located within the Floyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs which is operated by the City of Las Vegas.
History.
In 1933, the Tule Springs Expedition, led by Fenley Hunter, was the first major effort to explore the archaeological importance of the area surrounding Tule Springs.
The Nevada State Museum explored the springs area in 1962 and 1963 confirming that the area was home to Ice Age species as well as early North American Paleo-Indian peoples. Richard Shutler directed the project, and Vance Haynes studied the sedimentary layers, using radiocarbon dating to determine their ages. Animals discovered ground sloths, mammoths, prehistoric horses and American camels and the first giant condors in Nevada.
The springs site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 20, 1979.

The building are part of the Floyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs which is operated by the City of Las Vegas.
History.
The ranch district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 23, 1981.
The first establishment at Tule Springs may have been the U.S. Hotel owned by a Mr. Levandowski (ca. 1905). In 1916 a Mormon settler, Bert Nay, filed for water rights on the site. Nay sold the ranch to Gilbert Hefner in 1928, who owned the property until 1941 when he sold it to Sheriff Gene Ward, who in turn sold it to Prosper Jacob Goumond. Most of the buildings on the ranch date from the 1940s, when Goumond was developing the Tule Springs Ranch into a "divorce ranch."

Critical response.
The Guardian editor Alex Macpherson praised the production: "Thr33 Ringz' humour is still superbly crass and mostly enjoyable, especially when allied with the skittering beats and post-funk bounce of Freeze." Jesal 'Jay Soul' Padania of RapReviews.com called this song nice enough. Eric Henderson wrote a positive review: "Freeze" might be another freeze-dried Chris Brown upper, but it boasts the cleanest production this side of Ne-Yo."

Career.
Loukas had been signed to Priscilla's Model Management in Australia for less than a year after her stint on Australia's Next Top Model, before deciding to quit modelling because she had been sick of always being turned down for shows and for being told to lose more and more weight. When Loukas was still signed to Priscilla's Model Management, she had walked for numerous fashion shows, most notably for walking and opening the Christian Audigier in Los Angeles, as well as Fashion Assassin during the Spring/Summer Australian Fashion Week in 2007. She has also appeared in a television advertisement for Impulse. Loukas has also appeared in an edvertising in store campaign for Australian clothing brand, Jay Jays, in addition to an editorial in Dolly magazine. Loukas has a role in the psychological thriller "Next Door to the Velinskys" starring Matt Doran and Chloe Traicos. Loukas has been known to have a huge love for farm animals, mainly the goat however, she has stated that she could never become a vegetarian and support animal rights as she "enjoys meat way too much".
Australia's Next Top Model.
Loukas came third in the Fox 8 production, Australia's Next top Model. She was almost not picked for the show, due to her lack of model ideal height. Loukas dealt with the bitchiness of the girls, especially Paloma, but has now become best friends with winner of same cycle, Alice Burdeu.
Since Australia's Next top model, Loukas has appeared in an Impulse commercial, advertising 'New York Sass', She has had an eight page spread in Dolly Magazine, made a guest appearance at the Australian Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards, made various appearances on the red carpet and had been signed with Priscilla's Model Management where she walks various shows.
Runway To LA.
After a whirlwind of a couple of months, Fox 8 produced and aired a spinoff of Australia's Next Top Model, Runway to LA, which featured Charlotte Dawson as Jordan's mentor, as she works her way to Los Angeles. The show starts off in Sydney, emphasising the cultural differences between Dawson's and Loukas's life, but then follows the pair to Melbourne, where Jordan once again encounters Paloma, and then eventually to LA, where Jordan does media interviews, and meets the likes of Perez Hilton and Christian Audiger, whom she opens the Ed Hardy show for. The show is similar to 'Janice & Abbey: Beauty and the Best'. Where Britain's Next Top Model runner up Abigail Clancy is mentored by former America's Next Top Model judge and supermodel Janice Dickinson, and is taken from her hometown of Liverpool to Los Angeles, doing exactly the same tasks as Jordan in Runway To LA. She is also designing a new bikini line called "Dirty Lullaby".
Channel V Presenter Search.

Rawatpara

Rawatpara is one of the oldest localities of the historic city of Agra. It is situated very close to Agra Fort and also the river Yamuna. Rawatpara draws its name from the title Rawat. The Hindi dictionary meaning of the word "Rawat" conveys expressions that are akin to titles that used to be conferred by the Mughal emperors upon those whom they considered to be worthy of their salt. The legend is that Akbar's son Salim had raised the flag of revolt. During this period once Akbar's life was in danger owing to some surprise skirmish that was secretly planned and executed by those close to Salim. At that time Akbar was on a hunting trip some distance away from Agra and one Brahmin protected him and also gave him shelter till his troops arrived. Out of his gratitude Akbar conferred the title of RAWAT upon this Brahmin. Besides giving vast stretches of land, Akbar also gave a Haveli close to the Agra Fort to enable this BRAHMIN to stay close to the AGRA FORT. This place became an abode for the BRAHMIN and his family and came to be known as RAWATPARA. The family and kinsmen of the BRAHMIN saviour of Akbar continued to lead a prominent role as a part of the Mughal administration and prospered well owing to their proximity to the rulers and the place they had acquired in the power structure. They continued to profess their Hindu religion and Akbar being a liberal never had any problem on this count. Even his successor Shahajahan had no issue with some of his close courtiers being Hindus. However, Aurengzeb had different views on this issue. He wanted all those close to or part of the administration convert to Islam. This became a sort of Emperor's Writ. Forcible conversions became the order of the day. At that time, the Rawats of Rawatpara had two options either to convert to Islam or escape to the wilds with whatever they could carry with them. They exercised the second option. They left their abode at Rawatpara and moved towards the ravines of Chambals. In the process, the kin broke into small groups many of whom settled down in the areas outside Agra towards Kanpur and Shivpuri. The Haveli of Rawats at Rawatpara became abandoned. Over the years the place has assumed a new identity as a wholesale market for grains, pulses, spices etc. 
The best place to buy the famous Agra Petha and Dal Moth is Rawatpara. Most of the shops there are very old; some have been there since the Mughal period. Its is also very close to Johari Bazar and Kinari Bazar, which are the most popular shopping markets for the locals and tourist alike.

Deadly Cults

Deadly Cults: The Crimes of True Believers is a book on the subject of cults by Robert L. Snow. It was published November 30, 2003 by Praeger Publishers in hardcover format. Snow, a retired police captain and former commander of the homicide branch of the Indianapolis Police Department, has authored several other books on crime including "SWAT Teams" and "Technology and Law Enforcement".
Snow primarily relied on published material for reference, but also includes quotes from witnesses and experts. The book includes nine chapters and is structured by type of group. Snow discusses how individuals are led to conform to the "rules" of the groups, and a chapter of the book includes advice on how to avoid joining them. Deadly Cults received a positive review in "Booklist", and a reviewer for "Library Journal" said it "belongs in all public libraries".
Author.
Robert L. Snow is a retired police captain. He served as commander of the homicide branch of the Indianapolis Police Department. Snow is the author of several other books on crime including: "Sex Crimes Investigation", "Murder 101", "Stopping a Stalker", "Family Abuse", "SWAT Teams", "Technology and Law Enforcement", and "The Militia Threat".
Contents.
In the book's nine chapters, Snow presents case studies of controversial groups and movements and outlines how individuals are led to follow the "rules" of these organizations. The chapters are structured by the types of groups, such as "Religious Cults", "Occult Cults", "Millennial Cults", "New Age Cults", "UFO Cults", "Doomsday Cults", and "Suicide Cults". Snow primarily relies on published material for references as opposed to first-hand reporting. The majority of the book's references are secondary sources including magazines and newspaper articles, though Snow does also include quotes from experts and witnesses.
Groups including the Branch Davidians, Church Universal and Triumphant, the Church of Satan, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments, the Peoples Temple, Heaven's Gate, and the Unification Church are discussed in the book. Snow recounts results from a study of 353 former members of 48 cults in the United States, who recounted experiences after leaving their respective groups. After leaving the groups, 23 percent of former members stated they had attempted suicide, 63 percent had suicidal ideation, and 93 percent had experienced anxiety attacks. Snow devotes a chapter to deprogramming and advice on how individuals can avoid joining these groups from the outset.
Reception.
David Pitt wrote favorably of the book in a review in "Booklist", and described it as an "insightful look at cults and their charismatic leaders". A review in "Reference & Research Book News" commented that Snow: "does not bother with groups that are demonized as cults merely because they diverge from someone else's idea of truth or proper deportment, but focuses on those that are responsible for major crimes such as murder and torture". The book received a positive review in "Library Journal", and Michael Sawyer wrote: "Well written and researched, this book belongs in all public libraries and should be considered in academic libraries where there is an interest in cult history."

Allen Forest Zoo

Allen Forest Zoo (Hindi: कानपुर चिड़ियाघर / कानपुर प्राणी उद्यान, also called the Kanpur Zoo) is a zoo in Kanpur, the industrial hub of Uttar Pradesh in North India. It is the largest open green space in kanpur. Originally a natural habitat for fauna, it is one of the few zoos in India which were created in a natural forest.
The Allen Forest Zoo is located about two kilometers from the city’s center. In earlier colonial records it is mentioned as being close to Nawabganj, some distance away from Bithoor. Currently, the zoo is nearby the Azad nagar locality of Kanpur. The zoo is an oasis of green, a natural lake, and ancient trees, and encompasses the largest land area of any zoological garden in Asia.
The zoo is open for visitors on all days from 9 to 4.30, barring Monday. Given the vast spread, private four-wheeler vehicles are also allowed inside the zoo on payment of extra charges. Plastic bags are strictly banned inside zoo, even water is provided via coolers and not bottles.
The name of first appointed doctor of zoo was Dr. Ashwani Kumar Tripathi, he joined in 1975, was in team who bought modern technology to keep animals fit and healthy.
History.
The Zoological Park in Kanpur, (Cawnpore, Manchester of Asia, in British colonial period) was the brainchild of one Botanist Sir Allen, a member of the British Indian Civil Service. Sir Allen wanted to open the zoo in a natural forest, but his plans were stuck in bureaucratic red-tape and did not materialize. When the zoo was opened in 1971 by the government of independent India, it was named after him.
Allen forest was developed during the British rule between the years 1913-1918 by Mr. George Burney Allen, a famous British industrialist of Kanpur on the banks of the river Ganga.
The construction of the zoo was carried between 1971 to 1973.The 1st animal that came to the zoo was an Otter, which was caught by fisherman from the river Chambal.
The first doctor appointed at the Zoo is Dr. Ashwani Kumar Tripathi (1974/75), he graduated from College of Veterinary & Animal Sciences, GBPUAT,Pantnagar (G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology (GBPUA&T), Pantnagar) 
The enclosures for animals and birds were designed on the latest trends in the field of zoo building technology, well spread along the lake on either side of a semicircular arterial road of about 9 km. length.
Animals.
Mammals at the zoo include White Asian tigers, Asiatic lions, cheetah, leopard, jaguar, hyena, black bear, grizzly bear, sloth bear, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, monkeys, langoor, baboons, Musk deer, deer, and antelope. Chimpanzees (one of them named Chhajju, around 26 years of age) and orangutans (named Mangal, aged 0ver 30 years) have their own island. Some monkeys and deer are allowed to roam outside the enclosures as natural inhabitants of the zoo.
Amphibians at the zoo include Indian gharial.
The Lion at the zoo died of an unknown disease during the month of November 2010. Talks are on to bring a new Lion from another zoo in exchange of an animal.
Recently a new tigress has been brought in the zoo.
Attractions.
The zoo houses a botanical garden with a collection of some of the country’s rare species of plants that is dotted with sylvan lakes. The zoo grounds are also professionally maintained by forest conservationists, and it records large attendance from all age groups and communities in Kanpur. It is a popular destination for picnics, nature walks, and outdoor recreation, as well as teaching school students about natural habitats, environmental issues, and responsible eco-friendly living.
A rainwater lake is the centre of attraction at Allen Forest, and visitors can see hundreds of deer grazing in open savannah-like land without fear of any predator.
The Aviary includes birds from all over the world, including Ostrich from Africa and Emu from Australia and New Zealand, parrots, crane, parakeets, various Indian birds as well as European fowl, and Latin American birds..
Night creatures are housed in a separate building. These include porcupines, toddy cat and others.
The zoo includes an aquarium.
There are life size sculptures of pre-historic dinosaurs.
Conservation.
The zoo included a veterinary hospital that treats up to 1,400 animals at a time, including hyenas, jaguars, and elephants that are brought into the zoo, usually after bad encounters with humans.
Vehicles are allowed inside the zoo, but there is extra charge for this. Plastic water bottles and polythene bags are banned inside the park. Although photography is permitted, the zoo discourages visitors from feeding animals except in designated areas.
Sponsors.
The zoo authorities encourage local Kanpur and Uttar Pradesh based industrialists to take interest in the development and preservation of the ecological heritage of the Kanpur Zoo and its potential for development as a rare natural habitat based zoo.

Michael Bradford

Michael Bradford (born 1961 in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan) is an African American musician. He was born and raised on Detroit's East Side, an area that was once a working-class neighborhood, but quickly deteriorated into decay after the city's tumultuous riots in 1967.
The late 60s and early 70s were also a remarkable time in Detroit for music. The Motown Sound was sweeping the nation, but also local bands like The Rationals, Bob Seger and The Frost were getting constant exposure on local radio, along with rock from bands like The James Gang, Sly and the Family Stone and Vanilla Fudge. Many of these bands performed at a local concert venue, The Eastown Theatre, on Harper Avenue. The theatre was a converted movie theatre, and was a short distance from the Bradford home. Due to the influence of the rock crowd, the theatre had gotten a reputation for being "one of the city’s most notorious drug-infused rock venues". Michael's early exposure to rock music made him want to pursue a career in rock, rather than the more obvious choice of R&B.
In 1973, Michael was admitted to University Liggett School, a private school in Grosse Pointe Michigan. Fellow classmates included Jeffrey Eugenides, who would go on to write "The Virgin Suicides" and "Middlesex". Michael stayed at ULS, graduating from the 12th Grade in 1978.
Gerard Smerek.
Eventually, Michael started playing with local bands, and getting work in local Detroit recording studios, such as United Sound, Sound Suite and Ambience Recordings, in suburban Farmington Hills, MI. Ambience was a premiere studio at the time, and many records, commercials and industrial film soundtracks were recorded there. At Ambience, Michael met engineer Gerard Smerek, a local whiz who had production and allowing Michael to assist him recording sessions. Gerard's work ethic, combined with his reminder to become "necessary and useful" to his clients by anticipating their needs, inspired Michael to want to work behind the scenes, at the side of the artists who came into the studio.
Earl Klugh.
In 1981, Michael met jazz guitarist Earl Klugh, while working at Ambience. Earl was extremely successful at the time, making albums such as "Crazy For You". Earl was one of the most successful of the new instrumental jazz artists, and his compositions were heard on radios all over the world. Earl is still considered to be "one of the finest acoustic guitar players" on the music scene, but what also impressed Michael was the income that Earl was producing from his album sales and the royalties from airplay and TV and film licenses. Earl tutored Michael in composition, using examples from composers like Antonio Carlos Jobim. Earl also educated Michael about the mechanics of publishing, copyright and licensing. This information inspired Michael to become serious about songwriting as a career in which he could make a living.
Anita Baker.
Another artist who recorded at Ambience was Anita Baker. Gerard Smerek was her engineer as well, and Gerard brought Michael into Anita's camp to help with keyboard sounds and drum programming, using drum machines, samplers and recordings of percussion instruments to spice up the sound. This eventually led to receiving a production credit on Anita's 1994 album "Rhythm of Love". The album went double-platinum, getting great reviews and opening more doors for Michael.
Paul Buckmaster.
After the success of "Rhythm of Love", Michael was faced with a small dilemma. In 1994, faced with the choice between New York and Los Angeles, Michael chose Los Angeles, for the more agreeable climate. Upon his arrival, Michael was introduced to Paul Buckmaster, a legendary arranger for artists such as Elton John, Carly Simon and Train, and composer for films such as "12 Monkeys". Paul hired Michael as his programmer and engineer. Once again, a mentor relationship developed, and Paul taught Michael about arranging for orchestras, as well as giving Michael a basic understanding of film score techniques. Paul enlisted Michael's sound design and programming skills on independent films such as "The Maker", starring Matthew Modine and "Murder In Mind", starring Mary-Louise Parker. These sessions began a friendship and collaborative relationship that is still ongoing.
New Radicals.
While working with Paul Buckmaster, Michael was introduced to Gregg Alexander, whose band New Radicals had recently been signed to a record contract with MCA Records. Michael was hired to be an engineer for the album, specializing in editing the dense and complex tracks in order to yield a cohesive set of songs that sounded live and spontaneous. Michael's inspiration for this technique came from reading about the production of Rolling Stones albums, such as "Some Girls", that were edited performances that sounded live. Another influence was Paul Buckmaster's stories of Miles Davis and the edited nature of his albums.
Released in 1997 "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too" was a critical and commercial success, going Platinum in the U.S.A., and gold in several other countries.
Madonna.
A recurring theme in Michael's life has been his association with artists from his home state of Michigan. Anita Baker, Earl Klugh and Gregg Alexander were all from the Detroit area. For his next project, Michael was introduced to Madonna by New Radicals producer Rick Nowels. Rick enlisted Michael to create electronica-inspired drum loops and beats, which were used as building blocks for songwriting sessions that Rick was having with Madonna. Some of these songs were finished, and became part of Madonna's 1998 album "Ray of Light". Madonna took a liking to Michael, as he was from her home state of Michigan, and took to calling him "Detroit Mike", a nickname that he still is known by today.
Kid Rock.
In 1998, Michael had been given a demo by another Michigan native, Kid Rock. Michael called Rock, to express his interest in his music, and to offer to introduce him to record executives in California. Although Kid Rock eventually found his own way to a deal with Atlantic Records, he never forgot Michael's belief in him, and invited Michael to join him on his tour, opening for Limp Bizkit. Michael built a small "rolling studio" on Kid Rock's tour bus, and during this period, they recorded tracks for Kid Rock's triple-platinum album "The History of Rock". Also, at this time, Michael met Kid Rock's DJ, Matt Shafer, aka Uncle Kracker. Uncle Kracker was signed to Kid Rock's Top Dog Records, and during the tour, production began on Uncle Kracker's first album, "Double Wide".
With Kid Rock, Michael also created music for films such "", "Any Given Sunday" and "Shanghai Noon". Michael also contributed to Kid Rock's collaborations with Tommy Lee's Methods of Mayhem and remixes for the band Mindless Self Indulgence.
Uncle Kracker.
Uncle Kracker and Michael became frequent collaborators, starting with the co-writing of Kracker's breakout single "Follow Me". This song propelled "Double Wide" to eventually selling more than 2 million copies in the United States, with "Follow Me" becoming a top ten single in many countries around the world. Michael was also named as a producer of Double Wide, along with Kid Rock.
Michael stayed on to produce Uncle Kracker's next album, "No Stranger to Shame", which went gold, and yielded the successful singles "In A Little While" and "Drift Away", a song that broke the record for the most weeks at #1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Chart.
The next Uncle Kracker album was "Seventy Two and Sunny" also produced by Michael Bradford. This album explored Bradford and Kracker's fondness for 70's radio pop, and included guests Phil Vassar, Bret Michaels of the band Poison and Kenny Chesney.
For Uncle Kracker's fourth album, "Happy Hour" (2009), producer Rob Cavallo was brought in to make new recordings. However, some of Michael's songwriting was included, including "I'm Not Leaving" and "Another Love Song". Michael's production of "I'm Not Leaving" was also released on "" (2010), an EP of mixes, geared towards the country music market. This album also included "Letter To My Daughters", from "No Stranger to Shame".
Another song originally intended for "Happy Hour" was called "Some People". This song has subsequently been recorded by the Georgia band REHAB.
In addition to album production, Michael and Uncle Kracker have created music for several films, including "Good Boy", "Clockstoppers", "Osmosis Jones" and "American Pie 2".
Beth Hart.
In 2001, Michael was introduced to Beth Hart by Lava Records' President, Jason Flom. Michael and Beth began a musical collaboration that eventually yielded the 2003 album "Leave the Light On". The album featured Beth Hart's live band, with arrangements by Michael. Michael also played some additional keyboard and guitar overdubs during the post-productionphase of the album.
Deep Purple.
In 2002, Michael was contacted by Bruce Payne, manager of Deep Purple, and invited to come to one of their concerts in Brighton, England. Upon arriving, Michael met the band and was presented with the opportunity to produce their next album. After the tour ended, Michael and the band set up camp in Los Angeles, to write and record the album "Bananas", which was released in 2003. Reviews were positive, with Prog Archives Magazine commenting that Michael "proves himself to be a good songwriter, not just a great producer". The "Bananas" Tour went on to being a very successful run for the band, and Michael appeared onstage with Deep Purple several times during the promotion of the album.
In 2005, Deep Purple reconvened with Michael to record their next album, "Rapture of the Deep". This album was recorded at Michael's private studio in Tarzana, California. The album was recorded quickly, due to Bradford's concern that taking a long time would lose the spontaneity of the band. Although some band members felt rushed, the result was an album that caused the BBC to report, "lengthy jams, heavy riffs, chugging basslines, and waves of deliciously smoking Hammond organ signal an intent within the Purple camp. They're back, and they are on form". The Rapture of the Deep tour found the band circling the globe yet again, and once again, Michael joied them on stage periodically, culminating in a 2006 performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, the site first mentioned in Deep Purple's classic song "Smoke on the Water".
Dave Stewart.
In 2007, Michael met artist Dave Stewart, formerly of Eurythmics, who was looking for someone who could put together a band for him to perform a retrospective of his famous songs with, and also to write arrangements so that the songs could be performed with an orchestra. The first of these shows was to be a performance at the Tower Music Festival, in front of the Tower of London. In August 2010, Stewart and Bradford traveled to Blackbird Studios in Nashville, TN to record a new album of songs with local musicians.
Film/TV.
Michael has been active in television and film music, with songs and productions of his appearing in movies as diverse as Disney's ', ', "Freedom", the television series (Fox TV), "Hannah Montana", "Jump In" and "The Fan", starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes.
Bass Renaissance.
<br>Ringo Starr and Mike
Although known as an accomplished songwriter and producer, Michael has always considered himself a bassist. featuring Bradford on bass on certain tracks, along with fellow bassist Sir Paul McCartney on others. In July 2010, Michael was brought in by Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard to play bass on the upcoming Stevie Nicks album. Michael joined an A-List group of musicians for the album, including Waddy Wachtel, Steve Ferrone, Mick Fleetwood, Mike Rowe and Zac Rae. Michael has also enjoyed live performance in 2010, primarily with Jazz pianist Kevin Toney.
Bass Sound.
Michael is a proponent of Gibson Basses, primarily the Thunderbird 5-string model. Michael uses the Ampeg SVT-VR Bass Head with the matching 810E speaker cabinet. For live performances he prefers 2 heads and 2 cabinets. Michael uses a rack of effects by Line 6, including their Pod X3 Pro, Filter Pro, Mod Pro and Echo Pro rack-mount effects. Michael also uses the SWR Interstellar Overdrive Bass Preamp as a direct box signal. His slightly overdriven sound was inspired primarily by Deep Purple's Roger Glover, but also by the melodic styles of Jack Bruce, John Paul Jones and Mel Schacher of Grand Funk Railroad.
In addition to his Gibson Basses, Michael has a series of custom 5, 6 and 8-string basses made for him by Washburn. His most prized, and rarely seen bass is a one-of-a-kind fretless bass made for Michael by Joseph Santavicca, a luthier from Detroit. Joe has since passed away, making the bass truly irreplaceable. The bass took 2 years to complete, earning it the nickname "Slow Joe". It is usually kept in storage.
Guitar Sound.
Although primarily a bass player, Michael has played guitar since he was six years old. He has a large collection of electric and acoustic guitars, and is a lover of small-wattage, "boutique" amplifiers from THD, Gerhardt, Komet, and Blockhead. Michael also uses the larger ENGL Powerball, a four-channel amp with a 100 watt power rating. Michael uses 2 custom pedalboards with a variety of effects including the vintage A/DA Flanger and the Foxx Tone Machine, along with a Pete Cornish distortion box.
Production Style.
Although known for rock albums, Michael tends to take an old-school acoustic approach to recording, relying on microphone placement and room acoustics rather than outboard gear and effects. Working with the artist, Michael prefers a pre-production period where the songs can be written, played and critiqued before entering the studio to record. This requires the full involvement of the artist, and exposes any problems with the material before committing it to being recorded.
Once in the studio, Michael records quickly, following his often-spoken adage "If it takes too long, you are doing it wrong". This comes from Michael's experience with artists who, in search of perfection, end up undoing good work by constantly trying to improve it.
There is no signature "Bradford Sound", as he tries to do what is best for each artist. However, big guitars, simple lyrics and strong drums are his favorite hallmarks.
Michael plays many instruments on his productions, especially if the artist does not have a band, and he also does most of his own engineering and mixing. He is an avid user of Pro Tools software for recording and editing, but he has also been known to record basic tracks to tape.
Michael has had extensive experience recording vocalists including Anita Baker, Terence Trent D'arby and Mick Jagger. Michael prefers the CAD VX2 Microphone, along with a hand built preamp from Frank DiMedia Labs and Manley Labs' Opto-Compressor.
In "Sound on Sound" magazine, Michael summed up his philosophy this way: "For me it's really crucial to understand what the artist is basically trying to say through the record," Bradford explains. "That is, assuming the artist is actually trying to communicate some sort of deeper message, as opposed to just singing the song. Both kinds of record are valid — some are purely entertainment, whereas others have this whole level of communication going on, and if you are lucky enough to be part of one of those records, I think it's really important to listen to what the artist is trying to say. You can be of maximum use by just helping him or her to bring that out and get their point across."

Encostas d'Aire DOC

Encostas d'Aire is a Portuguese wine region located on the limestone hills extending across the northern end of the wider Lisboa wine region into the southwestern corner of the Beiras region. The region was initially an "Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada" (IPR) region, but in 2005, it was elevated to "Denominação de Origem Controlada" (DOC) status, and at the same time the Alcobaça IPR was merged into Encostas d'Aire to form a subregion.
Despite similar names, the Encostas d'Aire DOC is quite distinct from the former Encostas da Nave IPR located in the northern half of the Beiras region, which is now part of Távora-Varosa DOC and no longer used on wine labels, reducing the risk of confusion.
Grapes.
The principle grapes of the Encostas d'Aire region include Arinto, Baga, Fernao Pires, Periquita, Tamarez, Tinta Amarela and Vital.

Dick Thomas (rugby union)

Edward John Richard 'Dick' Thomas (14 October 1883 – 7 July 1916) was a Welsh international rugby union back who played club rugby for Mountain Ash.
Rugby career.
Thomas first played rugby for local Rhondda clubs, Ferndale and Penygraig before moving to Mountain Ash, the team he would captain during the 1904/05 season. He faced his first international opposition when he was chosen to represent Glamorgan, an invitational county team that faced the touring South Africans in 1906. Glamorgan played well but lost 6-3 though if Bert Winfield had completed his kicks the Welsh would have won. Thomas would gain his first cap later that year, when a Welsh team was formed to face the same South African team. Thomas, along with the other newly capped players, John Dyke and John Jenkins were judged not to show great ability, but were far superior to the other non-capped players available. Wales lost the game, which saw the end of many great Welsh players.
Unlike Dyke and Jenkins, Thomas was reselected for his country again, but he needed to wait until the 1908 Home Nations Championship, when he was chosen to face France at the Cardiff Arms Park. Under the captaincy of Teddy Morgan Wales were victorious, as they were two weeks later when Thomas won his third cap against Ireland in Belfast. Thomas's last game was the following year in a match against Scotland. Billy Trew not only led the team but scored the winning try which Jack Bancroft converted.
International games played.
Wales
Later life.
During World War I, Thomas was posted to France as a member of the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, 16th Battalion, and as a Company Sergeant Major was killed in action in the taking of Mametz Woods. He is commemorated at the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. Another Welsh international died in the same military action, wing player Johnnie Williams.

The New Addams Family

The New Addams Family is an American-Canadian sitcom that aired from October 1998 to August 1999 and aired on YTV in Canada and Fox Family in the United States. It was produced by Shavick Entertainment and Saban Entertainment as a revival of the 1960s series "The Addams Family".
Synopsis.
The new series features an entirely different cast and was well received. Gomez and Morticia were played by Glenn Taranto and Ellie Harvie respectively. The show reworked several storylines from the original series while incorporating modern elements, jokes, and references into the episodes. John Astin (Gomez from the original series) played Grandpa Addams, Gomez's grandfather. One of the most notable differences between the original show and the new series was that Wednesday and Pugsley were given expanded roles that demonstrated their more violent and sadistic personalities that were made popular by the films.
65 episodes were made, one more than the original series. It was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and ended in 1999 and 2000 in the United States. It was shown in reruns until Fox Family became ABC Family.
Theme.
The new theme, performed by the cast, was a complete departure from the familiar tune that had served (almost) all previous adaptations of the series. The familiar finger-snapping was present, albeit at a faster pace, and accompanied by two different characters (first Lurch, then Gomez) saying the word "snap" twice in rapid succession to match the beat. It was written by Barron Abramovitch, Jeremy Sweet, and Michael Whittaker.

The gun was intended to be a more powerful alternative to the 3-inch QF 12 pounder gun.
It was mounted on the following ships :
Its 25-pound shell proved insufficiently powerful to make it much of an improvement on the 12-pounder. From 1907 onwards it was succeeded in its class on new warships by the BL 4 inch gun Mk VIII, which fired a 31-pound shell.

He has represented Norway three times in the Chess Olympiad, 1996 (second reserve), 2000 (board two) and 2004 (second reserve). Apart from chess, Elsness is a medical doctor. 
Elsness was away from chess after dropping out of the Gausdal Classics tournament in 2001. The cause was an incident in the fifth round game against Kristian Trygstad, where Elsness was trying to win a rook and pawn versus rook endgame. Theoretically, the position should have been drawn, but Trygstad was in time trouble, and had asked the arbiter to declare the game drawn based on article 10.2 of the laws of chess, which allows the arbiter to end the game if the opponent is "making no effort to win the game by normal means". The arbiter Hans Olav Lahlum postponed the decision and watched the game's progress before granting Trygstad's claim when his time expired. Elsness played round 6, but dropped out of the tournament in protest against the decision in the Trygstad game. Elsness' return to organized chess came in 2004, where he finished fourth in the Norwegian championship. In 2007, Elsness won the Open Norwegian Championship for rapid chess.
Elsness' first Norwegian Chess Championship came in 2008. Elsness and Jon Ludvig Hammer both finished with 6.5/9 points in the main event in Tønsberg in July. The play-off between the two players was arranged September 26–27 in Moss. Elsness won the first game with White, and held the draw with Black, securing a 1.5-0.5 victory, and his first championship trophy.

Pico IPR

The Pico IPR is a Portuguese wine region located on the island of Pico in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The region is designated a second-tier "Indicação de Proveniencia Regulamentada" (IPR) classification, and potentially may be reclassified as a product of Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). 
The region is primarily known for fortified wines and historically for the UNESCO designation associated with the Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture.
History.
It is assumed that Franciscan monks brought the first grapes into the lands of Pico during the period of settlement and discovery. This clerics originally constructed churches and imported wine, essential in the celebration of masses through the archipelago. After verifying that the climatic conditions were comparable to Sicilly, they began to import various plants and wine castes, in particular, Verdelho. The vine began to proliferate easily throughout the island. Quickly, the wine produced turned famous and began to be exported into northern Europe and Russia.
With a climate characterized by weak temperature oscillation and elevated precipitation, and distributed throughout the year, allowed the production of white liqueur wines. This wine resulted from the grapes produced predominantly in the "Lajido" soils of the parishes. The basalt rocks are gathered together to form walls of loose volcanic rock, that protect the vines, that grow as high as above sea level. This tradition, which first began on Pico and that continues today was behind the designation of Pico's Vineyard Culture as a UNESCO Heritage Site.
Geography.
The geographic area of the IPR covers the municipalities of Madalena (specifically the civil parishes of Madalena, Candelária, Criação Velha and Bandeiras), São Roque do Pico (parishes of Santa Luzia, Prainha and the locality of Baía de Canas), and Lajes do Pico (specifically in the parishes of Piedade, and the localities of Engrade and Manhenha), as well as areas throughout the island above sea level.
Grapes.
The Pico IPR wine is commonly a white liqueur wine produced from grapes grown on rocky soils, located near the western coast of the island of Pico. The area of vine is quite reduced; vines are divided in tiny plots, called "currais", edged by walls made of loose pebbles, with the purpose of protecting the plants from the wind.
The principle grapes of the Pico region include Arinto, Terrantez and Verdelho.

Stichelton

Stichelton is an English blue cheese. It is similar to Blue Stilton cheese, except that it does not use pasteurised milk or factory-produced rennet. Randolph Hodgson of Neal's Yard Dairy and American Joe Schneider produce Stichelton in small batches in a dairy at Cuckney on the northern edge of Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. They use raw milk, rennet from calves' stomachs and hand-ladling and smoothing. The name comes from a form of the name of Stilton village in the 1086 "Domesday Book" ("Stichiltone/Sticiltone"), as the name Stilton cannot legally be used for the cheese.
History.
Although most Stilton cheeses have been made with pasteurised milk for many years, until 1989 the Colston Bassett dairy did make one Stilton with unpasteurised milk. However, following an outbreak of food poisoning incorrectly linked to the dairy and subsequently revealed to be unfounded, they decided to end production of the unpasteurised cheese. In 1996, this decision was permanently enshrined when Stilton was awarded Protected Designation of Origin status by the EU, with one of the criteria being the use of pasteurised cows milk.
Stichelton is produced by a partnership including Randolph Hodgson who owns the specialist cheese retailer Neal's Yard Dairy, and Joe Schneider who is an American who had been a cheesemaker in the Netherlands and the UK. In late 2004 Schneider and Hodgson discussed the possibility of recreating an unpasteurised Stilton-style cheese. They eventually found premises in which to start their dairy, on the Welbeck Abbey Estate near Worksop in Nottinghamshire.
Unable to be described as a Stilton, the new cheese was named Stichelton, which its makers say was based on the original name of the village of Stilton (the spelling "Stichelton" appears in the 13th century Lincoln Rolls). The first Stichelton cheese was produced in October 2006, reportedly from a starter culture obtained from the original producer by Hodgson's colleague, and subsequently kept alive for fifteen years.
Manufacture.
Stichelton is made in a dairy, from the unpasteurised milk of Friesian-Holstein cows at Collinthwaite Farm, on the Welbeck Estate in Nottinghamshire. "ForbesLife" magazine described it as a "sumptuous cheese that sets a full-flavored, succulent, complex chain of sensations going in your mouth: fruity and salty, buttery, and earthy, sharp and creamy. Robin Hood never had it so good." The starter culture for the cheese is known as MT36, the original culture used in the pre-1989 unpasteurised Stiltons, and is different from the culture that is used in modern pasteurised ones. MT36 was nearly lost to the cheese world forever, but fortunately a vial of it was sent to Ray Osborne, a starter producer, who kept it alive for 18 years.

Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion

Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion is an 1812 oil painting by John Martin. It has been called "The most famous of the British romantic works...;" it was the first of Martin's characteristically dramatic, grand, grandiose large pictures, and anchored the development of the style for which Martin would become famous. 
The painting shows a tiny human figure climbing in a mountain landscape. The man struggles to surmount a rocky outcrop beside a pool and waterfall; more jagged cliffs and peaks loom in the background, vastly receding.
Martin later stated that he finished the work in a month. And he wrote, "You may easily guess my anxiety when I overheard the men who were to place it in the frame disputing as to which was the top of the picture! Hope almost forsook me, for much depended on this work." (At the time, Martin had left his £2-per-week job as a glass painter in a china factory, and was attempting to establish himself as an independent artist.)
The artist's anxiety was unnecessary; displayed in the Royal Academy exhibition at Somerset House, the picture was a popular success. It was purchased for fifty guineas by William Manning, a member of the board of governors of the Bank of England. Reportedly, the Manning's "dying son had been moved by its depiction of the slight solitary figure clinging perilously to a ledge."
"What makes the work so remarkable is its persuasive combination of science and fantasy: while the scale seems beyond terrestrial experience, the attention given to geological and meteorological phenomena is that of the knowledgeable observer." Critics who accept the conventions of Romanticism in art have appreciated Martin's "Sadak"; those who do not have regarded the picture as lurid or puzzling.
Sadak is a fictional character in a story in James Ridley's "Tales of the Genii" (two volumes, 1764); it is a "faux"-Oriental tale allegedly from a Persian manuscript, but actually the work of Ridley himself. In Ridley's story, the hero Sadak is sent by his Sultan, Amurath, to find the memory-destroying "waters of oblivion." The Sultan maliciously intends to use the waters on Sadak's wife Kalasrade in a seduction attempt. Sadak endures a range of trials — a tempest at sea, a plague, evil genii, a subterranean whirlpool — before he attains his goal. In the end, the Sultan himself falls victim to the water's effect. Amurath dies; Sadak becomes Sultan. Martin's picture portrays Sadak at the climax of his struggle, just before he reaches the waters of oblivion.
The picture was reproduced as a steel-plate etching in 1828. The print bore a poem on the same subject, "Sadak the Wanderer," which was attributed by some to Percy Bysshe Shelley. Modern editors of Shelley are skeptical.
With this and his subsequent paintings, Martin gained a reputation for replicating the effects of stained glass on canvas. He employed a strong "chemical red" hue to express volcanic landscapes.
For many years the painting was known only in a reduced version in the Southampton Art Gallery. The full-size original was discovered in Sweden and acquired by the Saint Louis Art Museum in 1983. 
Martin followed "Sadak" with "Adam's First Sight of Eve" (1813) and "Clytie" (1814), both shown at the Royal Academy.

<doc id="19505797" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19505797" title="Amendments under the European Patent Convention">
Amendments under the European Patent Convention

Article 123 of the European Patent Convention (EPC) relates to the amendments under the EPC, i.e. the amendments to a European patent application or patent, and notably the conditions under which they are allowable. In particular, prohibits adding subject-matter beyond the content of the application as filed, while prohibits an extension of the scope of protection by amendment after grant.
Article 123(1) EPC.
Article 123(1) EPC provides the right for an applicant, in proceedings before the European Patent Office (EPO), to amend its European patent application and for a patent proprietor (during opposition proceedings) the right to amend its European patent. This must however be done in accordance with the Implementing Regulations, considering that the applicant is given "at least one opportunity to amend the application of his own volition." According the Implementing Regulations, amendments before receiving the (extended) European search report are generally not allowed, amendments are allowed in response to the extended European search report (i.e., in response to the communication under ), and amendments are also allowed shortly after entry into European phase of a PCT application (namely, in response to the communication under ), but any further amendment is subject to the consent of the Examining Division.
Article 123(2) EPC.
Article 123(2) EPC provides that a European patent application, or European patent, may not be amended (during prosecution for an application, and after grant for a patent) in such a way that it contains subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed. In other words, an amendment cannot go beyond the original disclosure of the application. The amended subject-matter must be directly and unambiguously derivable from the content of the application as filed. The underlying idea of Article 123(2) EPC is that an applicant should not be allowed to improve his position by adding subject-matter not disclosed in the application as filed, which would give him an unwarranted advantage and could be damaging to the legal security of third parties relying on the content of the original application. This legal provision illustrates the importance accorded by the Convention to the content of a European patent application as filed –i.e. on the filing date– in respect of its legal effects.
An extension of the subject-matter of the European patent beyond the content of the application as filed is a ground of opposition, and revocation.
Application.
The provisions of Article 123(2) EPC do not concern whether amendments have introduced an expression not present in the application as filed, but whether the amendments have introduced subject-matter extending beyond the content of the application as filed. In other words, the only relevant question is whether the skilled person is confronted, in the amended version of the application or the patent, with additional technical information compared to the technical information contained in the application as filed. If so, Article 123(2) EPC is violated.
When assessing the content of a European patent application as filed, the applicable standard of proof is a rigorous standard, namely the certainty "beyond reasonable doubt" rather than the "balance of probabilities", the normal standard of proof in civil proceedings.
Disclaimers.
A disclaimer defines, in a claim, subject-matter which is not claimed. By extension, a disclaimer may also mean the action of introduction a negative limitation in a claim, i.e. "an amendment to a claim resulting in the incorporation therein of a "negative" technical feature, typically excluding from a general feature specific embodiments or areas". The allowability of disclaimers is subject to particular conditions.
Under the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, disclaimers are allowed only in certain circumstances, as confirmed in G 1/03 and G 2/03 decisions:
In decision G 2/10, the Enlarged Board of Appeal further decided that:
Therefore, in G 2/10, the Enlarged Board of Appeal has essentially restored the possibility for an applicant or patentee to renounce part of its patent monopoly, subject to certain conditions.
Article 123(3) EPC.
Article 123(3) EPC prohibits amendments to granted claims during opposition proceedings in such a way as to extend the protection conferred by a European patent. It is for instance "not allowable to replace a technical feature of a granted claim with another technical feature which causes the claim to extend to subject-matter which was not encompassed by the granted claim." "Article 123(3) EPC is directly aimed at protecting the interests of third parties by prohibiting any broadening of the claims of a granted patent, even if there should be a basis for such broadening in the application as filed." While, before grant, the legal security of third parties has been considered to be "sufficiently protected by the prohibition of extending the content of the application by amendment beyond what was originally disclosed", without therefore prohibiting a broadening of the claims before grant, the situation is different after grant. After grant, "the interests of third parties are further protected by Article 123(3) EPC that the patentee's right to amend the claims is limited by the scope of the granted patent."
According to Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G 2/88, "it is the totality of the claims before amendment in comparison with the totality of the claims after the proposed amendment that has to be considered". If for instance the subject-matter of the claims is changed during opposition proceedings to a different embodiment and if, thereby, the scope of protection of the claims has been extended, the amendment, or change, is contrary to Article 123(3) EPC.
Inescapable Article 123(2) and (3) EPC trap.
If a European patent contains a feature which was not disclosed in the application as filed (in contravention of Article 123(2) EPC) and if the removal of this feature would extend the scope of protection beyond the scope conferred by the patent as granted (in contravention of Article 123(3) EPC), the European patent has, in principle, to be revoked. In principle again, it does not matter whether the amendment leading to such a situation may have been approved during prosecution by the examining division, since the responsibility for any amendment always lies with the applicant.

Jay R Sillona

Gaudencio Sillona III (born February 1, 1981), who performs under the mononym Jay R, is a Filipino singer-songwriter, actor, record producer and model. In 2003, he released his debut album, "Gameface", under Universal Records. The album containted the number one single, "Bakit Pa Ba", received numerous awards, and was certified Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry. He made his big screen debut in the 2004 feature film "Happy Together", and later, released his self-titled second album in 2005.
In 2006, he built a recording studio inside his mansion, followed by a recording label called JAYRS Music. He later renamed it as Homeworkz Records. In the same year, he released a Christmas album, "Christmas Away from Home", and dedicated it to his late uncle Reny. The album was re-released in 2008, where he donated the proceeds from the sales to GMA's Kapuso Foundation. Also in 2008, he released a cover album, "Soul in Love", which became his highest-rated and biggest-selling album.
He released an all-Tagalog album early in 2010, "Jay R Sings OPM Love Classics", which consists of revivals of Original Pilipino Music love songs. Later, he recorded a Bahasa song, which is slated for release in Indonesia. He is part of TV musical variety show "Party Pilipinas" on GMA, and hosts the Philippine adaptation of dating game show "Take Me Out" on the same network.
Early life.
Gaudencio Aquino Sillona III was born on February 1, 1981 in Glendale City, Los Angeles, California, United States, where he was raised by his parents Gaudencio Sillona, Jr., a pianist, and Amparo Aquino Sillona, a singer. He is the youngest among four siblings. On his father's side, he has five brothers, saying "Before my parents got together, my father was married to somebody else". He speaks fluent Tagalog. Among his musical influences as a young man were Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross and Gary Valenciano. He attended St. Genevieve's School in Panorama City. He was second-year college, taking up Computer Engineering at DeVry University in Los Angeles, California, when he decided to fulfill his dream of becoming a singer.
Music career.
1997–2002: Early works and debut.
At the age of sixteen, Sillona already belonged to a group called FI (First Impression). The group consisted of five members namely—Mike Gabriel, Alex Bacani, Jay R Sillona, Jimmy Martinez (who came with him to Manila and is now Jimmy Muna) and Owen Amurao. When Mike, Owen and Alex went their separate ways, he and Martinez continued the group by adding another talented singer named Kris Cadevida (later known as Kris Lawrence). They would do gigs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Michigan. He was also the lead singer, with his sister Jhing, of another band that was led by his uncle, Robert Sillona, called The Howlers. Later, Jhing collaborated with him in creating hit songs.
Sillona later started performing gigs all around Southern California. He also did back-up vocals for major artists, whose albums were released in the United States, Latin America, Philippines and other territories. Later, he started co-writing songs with international artists. He collaborated with Ray Brown, Troy Johnson, Jason Edmonds, 3AM, Steve Singer, Gary Brown, The Triangle, Dutch Cousin, Chuck Cymone and many other talented producers.
2003–2005: "Gameface" and self-titled album.
In 2003, Sillona signed a contract under Universal Records label. His first album, entitled "Gameface", consists of twelve tracks, containing two original Tagalog songs—“Kaibigan”, written by his sister Jhing Sillona, and “Bakit Pa Ba”, written by Vehnee Saturno. Most of the other songs on the album are R&B cuts, and were co-written by him. Ten of the tracks were produced by respected American producers Troy Johnson, Ian Boxhill and Bryson Evans. His first single, “Design for Luv”, is a R&B, hip-hop single, and had its music video filmed and produced in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California with the help of good friend Ray Brown. Following the first single, he released a Tagalog ballad penned by Vehnee Saturno, entitled "Bakit Pa Ba". It reached the top of Philippine single charts, becoming the biggest hit not only from the album, but also from the artist. In 2004, the album was re-released with two new songs that were later used as singles. The album was well-received both commercially and critically. It was certified Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry. It was also nominated in numerous categories of major music awards. On the 2004 MTV Pilipinas Music Awards, "Bakit Pa Ba" won Sillona the Favorite Male Artist award, also allowing him to grab the "Best Ballad" title on the Awit Awards of the same year. In April 2004, he accomplished his first ever three-night solo major concert which was entitled Gameface the Concert at the Music Museum, immediately followed by Gameface Reload in September 2004.
After the success of his debut album, Sillona focused on doing a more complex R&B sound. He covered the Billy Joel original "Just the Way You Are", making a whole different arrangement, complete with street-beat rap and his distinct R&B flavor. In addition, he recorded an alternate version of the song, featuring Irish pop singer, Samantha Mumba. Alongside the single, his self-titled album was released. Among the album's collaborators are rappers Young Clipp, Jdimes, and Sillona's best friends, Jimmy Muna and Kris Lawrence. "Ngayo'y Narito", another ballad by Saturno, was released as the album's second official single. "Hey Ma" was sent to radio in 2006 to boost up album sales and popularity, but it failed to make an impact to the public. The album received positive reviews, with "Titik Pilipino" stating "I can't find a bad word for Jay R (the artist and "the album") because he and his album are good". Despite high ratings, it failed to gather any award it was nominated for. Still, the album managed to reach gold status by the PARI. In 2005, he was part of "Footloose: The Musical", together with Iya Villania. In the same year, he appeared on Karylle's album, "You Make Me Sing", as a featured artist, songwriter and producer.
2006–2009: Homeworkz Records and "Soul in Love".
In 2006, Sillona built a recording studio inside his two-story mansion. With a studio, he had to follow it up with a recording label, and he did. It was called JAYRS Music. In an interview about his recording studio, he explained "It’s a necessity for a recording artist [...] It saves a lot of money in the long run and it’s very convenient. You can work on the recordings at any time of the day". The studio occupies a large room that was originally one of the bedrooms. Sillona himself was the one who conceptualized the look, which pictures a modern bachelor’s pad with dark carpeting and sofas, and a bar for small parties. Although, it has everything a recording artist needs—recording equipments he acquired in the U.S., personal computer, a black upright piano and a recording booth. In 2008, he renamed it as Homeworkz Records.
In November 2006, he released his first ever Christmas album, "Christmas Away from Home". The album consists of classic Christmas songs and two originals, one featuring his sister Jhing entitled "Spread the Love". It, also, was inspired by and dedicated to his late uncle Reny. He stated, "The entire album is actually inspired by him [...] His death triggered something in me, and I knew that a tribute was the best way to thank him and cherish his legacy". Produced by JAYRS Music, it marks his initial attempt at running his own independent record label. He single-handedly produced, arranged, mixed, mastered and attended to all details. The album was re-released in 2008 as "Holiday of Love", including six additional Christmas songs, replacing the three instrumentals. Album sales and proceeds were entirely donated to GMA-7's Kapuso Foundation. He stresses the album's title, saying "It’s Christmas after all [...] it’s only fitting that I practice what I preach. It’s all about giving". In 2007, he was featured on Amber's song, "FYI".
Early in 2008, Sillona released another studio album, "Soul in Love". It was his second cover album, containing classical R&Bs and jazzes that he grew up listening to. The album has received the highest ratings among Jay R albums, and has even sold impressively, certifying gold in the Philippines without any initial promotion. It has also helped him gain new audience and group of fans. "Titik Pilipino" gave the album a perfect rating of five out of five stars, saying "As everybody should be well aware of by now, Jay R is a very talented artist". It has also earned Sillona numerous awards and nominations on awarding events. On the 2008 Philippine Hip-Hop Awards, he won the R&B Artist of the Year award for the first time.

Other ventures.
Sillona has admitted himself as a business-minded person, saying that unlike show business, he wanted something stable and something that's working already. In 2007, he built a recording studio in his house called JAYRS Music, which was later renamed as Homeworkz Studio. With a studio, he had to follow it with a recording label, and so he did. It was named as Homeworkz Records. Under the label, he self-handedly writes and produces songs, and has recorded three of his albums—"Christmas Away from Home", "Soul in Love" and "Jay R Sings OPM Love Classics".

After the disaster, he decided to just focus and invest on a Ministop outlet that he bought at Wilson Street in Greenhills Shopping Center, instead of reconstructing his club. He stated in an interview that Katya Santos was the one who recommended him to go into this kind of business. He also had ideas of owning a Burger Machine branch, but as he inquired, he knew that the business has no franchise.

Roll-O-Plane

The Roll-O-Plane also known as the Bullet is an amusement park ride that originated in America. It was invented by the Eyerly Aircraft company of Oregon as an updated and more exciting version of the Loop-O-Plane. The ride is commonly nicknamed the "Salt and Pepper Shakers".
The ride consists of a rotating arm mounted to a pivoting hinge on a central support column. The arm has two enclosed cars (one at the top and bottom). Each car holds four riders seated in pairs facing opposite directions making the maximum capacity eight riders. 
When in motion, the arm swings until it makes a complete loop; however, the riders never become inverted (upside-down). This is because ride has two "twists" the older version didn't. First, the arm pivots while the ride is in motion. Second, the cars are free to rotate horizontally or "roll" while the ride is in motion, always keeping the riders right-side-up.
This once common ride can now only be found in a handful of parks including:

Lloyd Mathews

Sir Lloyd William Mathews KCMG, CB (7 March 1850 – 11 October 1901) was a British naval officer, politician and abolitionist. Mathews joined the Royal Navy as a cadet at the age of 13 and progressed through the ranks to lieutenant. He was involved with the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1873–4, afterwards being stationed in East Africa for the suppression of the slave trade. In 1877 he was seconded from the navy to Sultan Barghash of Zanzibar in order to form a European-style army; he would remain in the employ of the government of Zanzibar for the rest of his life. His army quickly reached 6,300 men and was used in several expeditions to suppress the slave trade and rebellions against the Zanzibar government.
Mathews retired from the Royal Navy in 1881 and was appointed Brigadier-General of Zanzibar. There followed more expeditions to the African mainland, including a failed attempt to stop German expansion in East Africa. In October 1891 Mathews was appointed First Minister to the Zanzibar government, a position in which he was "irremovable by the sultan". During this time Mathews was a keen abolitionist and promoted this cause to the Sultans he worked with. This resulted in the prohibiting of the slave trade in Zanzibar's dominions in 1890 and the abolition of slavery in 1897. Mathews was appointed the British Consul-General for East Africa in 1891 but declined to take up the position, remaining in Zanzibar instead.
Mathews and his troops also played a key role in the ending of the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 which erupted out of an attempt to bypass the requirement that new Sultans must be vetted by the British consul. During his time as first minister Mathews continued to be involved with the military and was part of two large campaigns, one to Witu and another to Mwele.
Mathews was decorated by several governments, receiving appointments as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, Companion of the Order of the Bath and as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George from the British government and membership in the Prussian Order of the Crown. Zanzibar also rewarded him and he was a member of the Grand Order of Hamondieh and a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar. Mathews died of malaria in Zanzibar on 11 October 1901.
Early life and career.
Mathews was born at Funchal on Madeira on 7 March 1850. His father, Captain William Matthews was Welsh, and his mother Jane Wallis Penfold, was the daughter of William Penfold and Sarah Gilbert. Her sister, Augusta Jane Robley née Penfold was the author of a famous book about the flora and fauna of Madeira, which is now in the Natural History Museum. Mathews became a cadet of the Royal Navy in 1863 and was appointed a midshipman on 23 September 1866. From 1868 he was stationed in the Mediterranean but his first active service was during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1873–4 where he qualified for the campaign medal. He was promoted to lieutenant on 31 March 1874. On 27 August 1875 Mathews was posted to , a depot ship and the Royal Navy headquarters for East Africa, to assist in the suppression of the slave trade in the area. Whilst onboard he drilled his own troops, captured several slave dhows and was commended for his actions by the Admiralty.
Commander in Chief of Zanzibar.
In August 1877, Mathews was seconded from the Navy to Sultan Barghash of Zanzibar to form a European-style army which could be used to enforce Zanzibar's control over its mainland possessions. The army had traditionally been composed entirely of Arabs and Persians but Mathews opened up recruitment to the African majority on the island and had 300 recruits in training by the end of the year. In addition, Mathews employed some unorthodox recruitment methods such as purchasing slaves from their masters, using inmates from the prison and recruiting from Africans rescued from the slavers. In June 1877, at the instigation of John Kirk, the explorer and friend of the Sultan, the British government sent a shipment of 500 modern rifles and ammunition as a gift with which to arm the troops. Mathews introduced a new uniform for the troops consisting of a red cap, short black jackets and white trousers for the enlisted ranks and dark blue frock coats and trousers with gold and silver lace for the Arab officers. The latter was possibly modelled on the Royal Navy officers uniform with which he was familiar. The army grew quickly; by the 1880s Mathews would command 1,300 men, his forces eventually numbering 1,000 regulars and 5,000 irregulars.
One of the first tasks for the new army was to suppress the smuggling of slaves from Pangani on the mainland to the island of Pemba, north of Zanzibar. The troops completed this mission, capturing several slavers and hindering the trade. Mathews retired from the Royal Navy in June 1881 and was appointed Brigadier-General of Zanzibar. In 1880, the Sultan dispatched a military force under Mathews to bring his unruly African mainland territories under control. Mathews' expedition was initially intended to reach Unyanyembe but his men refused to march inland and, when made to do so, deserted in large numbers. The expedition ended instead at Mamboya where a 60-man garrison was established. This had been reduced to a mere handful of men by the mid-1880s but the expedition proved that the Sultan was serious about maintaining control of all of his possessions. Mathews' men were also involved in several expeditions to halt the land-based slave trade which had developed once the seas became too heavily policed for the traders.
In 1881 Mathews' old vessel, the , had been made seaworthy once more and was captained by Charles J Brownrigg. This vessel and her crew made several patrols aimed at hindering the slave trade and, on 3 December 1881, caught up with a slave dhow captained by Hindi bin Hattam. This dhow had around 100 slaves on board and was transporting them between Pemba and Zanzibar. Captain Brownrigg led a boarding party to release the slaves but bin Hattam's men then attacked the sailors, killing Brownrigg and his party before sailing away. Mathews led a force to Wete on Pemba and, after a short battle, took a mortally wounded bin Hattem prisoner before returning to Zanzibar.
Mathews returned to the African mainland territories once more in 1884 when he landed with a force which intended to establish further garrisons there to dissuade German territorial claims. This attempt ultimately failed when five German warships steamed into Zanzibar Town harbour and threatened the Sultan into signing away the territories which would later form German East Africa. Further territories were ceded to the German East Africa Company in 1888 but unrest amongst the locals against them prevented them from taking control and Mathews was dispatched with 100 men to restore order. Finding around 8,000 people gathered against the German administrators Mathews was forced to return with his men to Zanzibar. He landed once again with more troops but found himself subject to death threats and that his troops would not obey his orders and so returned again to Zanzibar.
First Minister.
In October 1891, upon the formation of the first constitutional government in Zanzibar, Mathews was appointed First Minister, despite some hostility from Sultan Ali bin Said. In this capacity Mathews was "irremovable by the sultan" and answerable only to the Sultan and the British Consul. His position was so strong that one missionary on the island is quoted as saying that his powers defied "analytical examination" and that Mathews really could say "L'état est moi" (). Mathews was also known as the "Strong man of Zanzibar". The principal departments of government were mostly run by Britons or British Indians and Mathews' approval was required before they could be removed from office. Mathews was rewarded by the Zanzibar government for his role with his appointment as a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar, which he was granted licence by Queen Victoria to accept and wear on 17 May 1886. Mathews used his position to suppress slavery in the country and in 1889 convinced the Sultan to issue a decree purchasing the freedom of all slaves who had taken refuge in his dominions and, from 1890, the prohibiting the slave trade. On 1 February 1891 Mathews was appointed Her Majesty's Commissioner and Consul-General to the British Sphere of Influence in East Africa. He never took up the post and instead chose to remain in Zanzibar.
Mathews was rewarded for his service in Zanzibar by the British government which appointed him a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1880 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 24 May 1889. Despite becoming renowned in East Africa as a man who ran a fair administration and was strict with criminals, unhappiness with effective British rule and his halting of the slave trade led some Arabs to petition the Sultan for his removal in 1892. In 1893 Mathews purchased the island of Changuu for the government. He intended it to be used as a prison but it never housed prisoners and was instead used to quarantine yellow fever cases before its present use as a conservation area for giant tortoises. Mathews was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1894. He was also awarded membership of the Order of the Crown by the German government.
Matters came to a head when Khalid bin Barghash attempted to take control of the palace in Zanzibar Town upon the death of his uncle in August 1896, despite failing to gain the consent of the British consul there. Mathews opposed this succession and, with British agreement, called up 900 soldiers in an attempt to prevent it. This situation eventually led to the Anglo-Zanzibar War and Mathews, with the support of Admiral Harry Rawson and five vessels of the Royal Navy, bombarded the palace and secured the end of Khalid's administration. Mathews' helped to arrange the succession of a pro-British Sultan, Hamoud bin Mohammed, as Khalid's successor. Mathews continued his reforms after the war, abolishing slavery in 1897 and establishing new farms to grow produce using Western techniques. He was appointed a member of the Grand Order of Hamondieh of Zanzibar and was permitted to accept and wear the decoration on 25 August 1897.
Military expeditions.
Mwele.
In addition to the smaller-scale expeditions described earlier, Mathews embarked on two much larger expeditions to the African mainland during his tenure as first minister, the first at Mwele. The initial rebellion in the area had been led by Mbaruk bin Rashid at Gazi, which Mathews had put down with 1,200 men in 1882. However in 1895 Mbaruk's nephew, Mbaruk bin Rashid, refused to acknowledge the appointment of a new leader at Takaungu. This led to open rebellion at Konjoro in February of that year when the younger Mbaruk attacked Zanzibari troops under Arthur Raikes, one of Mathews' officers. Mathews was part of an Anglo-Zanzibari expedition sent to quell it, which consisted of 310 British sailors, 50 Royal Marines, 54 Sudanese and 164 Zanzibari troops. Konjoro was destroyed and the leaders fled to Gazi where the older Mbaruk failed to turn them over. Another force, under Admiral Rawson, with 400 British marines and sailors, was sent after them. This further expedition failed to capture the ringleaders and a third expedition was organised by Rawson with 220 sailors, 80 marines, 60 Sudanese and 50 Zanzibaris, which destroyed Mwele. During the latter action Mathews was wounded in the shoulder.
Witu.
Following the death of a German logger who had been operating illegally, the Sultan of Zanzibar and the British government dispatched an expedition on 20 October 1890 to bring the Sultan of Witu to justice. Nine warships and three transports carrying 800 sailors and marines, 150 Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEA) Indian police, 200 Zanzibari and 50 Sudanese troops were sent, defeating the Sultan and establishing a British protectorate. The IBEA was given control of the area and established a force of 250 Indian police to maintain the peace. The police were withdrawn in July 1893 following threats of violence from the new Sultan of Witu, Oman, and another expedition was dispatched to the region. This consisted of three warships: , HMS Sparrow and the Zanzibari ship HHS "Barawa". The latter carried Mathews with 125 Askaris and 50 Sudanese under Brigadier-General Hatch of the Zanzibar army.
Mathews and an escort force went to Witu where, on 31 July, they removed the flag of the IBEA company and replaced it with the red flag of Zanzibar, before destroying several villages and causing Oman to retreat into the forests. The British troops then withdrew, having suffered heavily from malaria, but the Sudanese and Zanzibari troops remained. A further expedition was sent of 140 sailors and 85 other troops but Oman died soon after and a more pliable sultan, Omar bin Hamid, was appointed to govern on behalf of Zanzibar, bringing the affair to a close. In return for this action, Mathews received the British East and West Africa campaign medal.
Later life.
Mathews died of malaria in Zanzibar on 11 October 1901 and was buried with full military honours in the British cemetery outside Zanzibar Town. His successor as first minister was A.S. Rogers. Changuu island, which Mathews bought for a prison, now has a restaurant named in his honour and also a church. Mathews House, at the Western end of Zanzibar Town, is also named for him.

Envy (software)

Envy was an open source application that was written in python and pyGTK. It was intended to make the process of installing and uninstalling ATI or Nvidia proprietary graphics drivers on Linux distributions easier. Envy automatically detected the correct graphics card, installed the appropriate driver from online software repositories and configured the X server. However development stopped in February 2010, due to lack of time on the developer's part and it no longer works with current Linux versions.
Early Development.
The Envy project was started by Alberto Milone, an open source enthusiast. Envy Legacy was developed and maintained by Alberto Milone himself, however, EnvyNG (Envy's Next Generation) is developed and maintained collaboratively by Ubuntu developers and Alberto Milone.
Release History and supported operating systems.
There were two versions of Envy available: Envy Legacy and EnvyNG.
EnvyNG.
EnvyNG was included in Linux Mint Elyssa's default installation. PowerPC architecture, however, was not supported.

<doc id="19506035" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19506035" title="It Hurts Me Too">
It Hurts Me Too

"It Hurts Me Too" is a blues standard that is "one of the most interpreted blues ". First recorded in 1940 by American blues musician Tampa Red, the song is a mid-tempo eight-bar blues that features slide guitar. It borrows from earlier blues songs and has been recorded by many blues and other artists.
Origins.
"It Hurts Me Too" is based on "Things 'Bout Comin' My Way", recorded by Tampa Red in 1931 (OKeh 1637). The melody lines are nearly identical and instrumentally they are similar, although the latter has an extra bar in the turnaround, giving it nine bars. "Sam Hill from Louisville", one of several pseudonyms of Walter Vinson (or Vincson), recorded "Things 'Bout Coming My Way" shortly before Tampa Red (1931 Brunswick 7216). Vinson's version is based on his earlier recording with the Mississippi Sheiks, "Sitting on Top of the World" (1930 OKeh 8784). Both songs share several elements with "You Got to Reap What You Sow", recorded by Tampa Red in 1929 (Vocalion 1404) and by Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell in 1928 (Vocalion 1232). The melody lines, played on slide guitar by Tampa Red and sung by Carr, are similar to those in the later songs. Carr and Blackwell's song has elements of their own earlier 1928 song "How Long, How Long Blues" (Vocalion 1191). "How Long, How Long Blues" has been described as one of the first blues standards and the inspiration for many blues songs of the era.
In 1949, Tampa Red recorded a variation of "It Hurts Me Too", titled "When Things Go Wrong with You" (Victor 22-0035). The song was recast in the style of a Chicago blues, with electric guitar and a more up to date backing arrangement. The song was a hit and reached No. 9 in the Billboard R&B chart in 1949. (The original "It Hurts Me Too" was released before Billboard or a similar reliable service began tracking such releases, so it is difficult to gauge which version was more popular, although the former's title won out over the latter's.) Although the song retained the refrain "When things go wrong, so wrong with you, it hurts me too", Tampa Red varied the rest of the lyrics somewhat. This would become the pattern for future versions, in which succeeding artists would interpret the song with some of their own lyrics.
Elmore James versions.
Several versions of "It Hurts Me Too" were recorded in the 1940s and 1950s, including those by Stick McGhee and Big Bill Broonzy. When Elmore James recorded it in 1957 (Chief 7004), he (or Chief's owner, Mel London, who is credited on the release) supplied some of the lyrics that are most familiar today:
James' 1957 Chief version did not appear in the charts, but after he recorded the song again in late 1962 or early 1963 for the Fire/Fury/Enjoy group of labels, it became a hit. The song used the same lyrics as his earlier version, but featured more prominent slide guitar work. When it was released in 1965 (Enjoy 2015), two years after James' death, "It Hurts Me Too" spent eight weeks in the R&B chart, where it reached No. 25. The song also appeared in the Billboard Pop chart at No. 106, which was James' only single to do so. Subsequent versions of "It Hurts Me Too" often showed Elmore James' influences, either in the lyrics or guitar parts.
Junior Wells versions.
Junior Wells made the song one of his standards and often used James' lyrics. He recorded it several times, including as a single in 1962 (Chief 7035), for the 1966 compilation album "Chicago/The Blues/Today! Volume 1" (Vanguard VSD 79216), and in 1979 for his "Pleading the Blues" album with Buddy Guy (Isabel 900.501).
Other versions.
"It Hurts Me Too" has been recorded by many blues and other artists, including: John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers (from the expanded "A Hard Road" album 1967), Chuck Berry ("Live at Fillmore Auditorium" 1967), Savoy Brown ("Blue Matter" 1968), Bob Dylan ("Self Portrait" 1970), Hound Dog Taylor ("Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers" 1971), Grateful Dead ("Ladies and Gentlemen... the Grateful Dead" 1971), Foghat ("Stone Blue" 1978), Eric Clapton ("From the Cradle" 1994), Susan Tedeschi ("Better Days" 1995), Gov't Mule with Little Milton ("Mulennium" 1999), and Keb Mo ("The Door" 2000).
Recognition.
In 2012, Tampa Red's 1940 "It Hurts Me Too" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in the "Classic of Blues Recording - Single or Album Track" category.

Jamboree 2008 (Northumberland)

Jamboree 2008 was developed as "an Inter-organisational & International event" which was intended to "bring 600 young people from Scouting and Guiding together — to develop skills & friendships that will lay the foundations for the next 100 years of Scouting". The Jamboree was set up to be independent of Associations, and hoped to involve members of the World Federation of Independent Scouts (WFIS), the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).
Jamboree 2008 was held at Green Carts, Humshaugh, Northumberland and ran for eight days, between 16 and 22 August. The final day marked 100 years since Robert Baden-Powell met thirty Scouts at Fourstones Railway Station (about a mile south of Carr Edge) and marched them up to the camp site for the Humshaugh Camp, accepted as the first official Scout Camp to be run by Baden-Powell.
Purpose.
Jamboree 2008 was established to be an event allowing young people from all the uniformed youth movements, including the Boy's Brigade, to work together whilst celebrating the centenary of the Humshaugh Camp The Jamboree was established independent of any Association, and was intended to be open to members of all Scouting organisations.
It was hoped that the specialist training given to volunteer leaders would continue to have an impact on the wider movement. It was also intended to highlight how Scouting has developed to meet the needs and interests of today's young people. Another intention was for the jamboree to develop links between the different Scouting organisations.
Participation.
The event was attended by 600 Scouts from many parts of the United Kingdom and from Portugal. The majority of the attendees were from the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association, with local members of The Scout Association choosing to mark the centenary through a display in a local town rather than attending the event. Although the Scout Association decided not to support the event, they also did not issue a blocking statement, so a number of SA members attended.
Jamboree 2008 was proud to host the President of the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association, Lawrie Dring, one of the founding members of the BPSA and of WFIS. Johnny Walker — the author and publisher of the Scouting Milestones website also attended the event, bringing a display of memorabilia and giving talks on Scout history.
The event also welcomed a number of volunteers from outside of Scout organisations — these included friends, family and colleagues of the organisers and participants of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award. In line with the event's Child Protection policy, all adults were checked for their suitability to work with children by the Criminal Records Bureau.
Events.
Despite heavy rainfall, the event proved a success by allowing the participants to access all manner of traditional Scouting activities including:
Hubs.
The Jamboree was divided into four hubs. These were named after patrols created by Baden-Powell at his camp, Bulls, Kangaroos, Ravens and Wolves.
Training scheme.
In addition to a week long event, Jamboree 2008 embarked upon a training scheme which enabled the participating adult volunteers to access a number of training schemes including:
These qualifications were then utilised for the Jamboree 2008 camp itself. The goal of the training scheme was to develop a lasting legacy beyond the camp itself.
Funding.
The Jamboree 2008 project was set up as a not-for-profit event and so costs were intentionally kept to a minimum. This enabled the cost of the camp to be £50 per person for the week including all memorabilia and access to all events. In addition to this, centralised catering was made available for a cost of £37.50 per person for the week. The event aimed to be as inclusive as possible by keeping these costs as low as possible.
The project received additional funding from the following organisations:
Media coverage.
The event itself generated substantial media interest including various local and regional newspaper acticles. The BBC 1 Look North Regional News spent the day at the campsite and filmed a midday and evening feature covering the Jamboree. In addition to the news presenter partaking in the activities alongside the Scouts, the weather forecast also took place from the water-logged campsite.
Supporting Companies.
The Jamboree 2008 project was supported by the following companies:

Malalai Kakar

Malalai Kakar (1967 – 28 September 2008) was the most high-profile policewoman in Afghanistan after the ousting of the Taliban in 2001. A Lieutenant Colonel, she was the head of Kandahar's department of crimes against women. Kakar, who received numerous death threats, was assassinated by the Taliban on September 28, 2008.
Kakar joined the police force in 1982, following in the footsteps of her father and brothers. She was the first woman to graduate from the Kandahar Police Academy, and the first to become an investigator with the Kandahar Police Department.
Gender issues in Afghan law enforcement.
The fate of Malalai Kakar illustrates the intricacies of gender issues in law enforcement in Afghanistan. Female Afghan police officers leave their homes hidden by a burqa, to don a police uniform and weapon at the police station to do their job.
By the end of 2009 there were about 500 active duty policewomen in Afghanistan, compared with about 92,500 policemen. A few dozen serve in the southern provinces Kandahar and Helmand, where the influence of the Taliban is strongest.
Policewomen play an essential role in the war against insurgents in Afghanistan. In a culture that is marked by a strict separation of the sexes, the security forces need women to perform special tasks, like the searching of women and homes. They are essential to conduct home searches, since Afghans are deeply offended when male soldiers or police enter premises where women are present, and at checkpoints men cannot search women for concealed weapons and other contraband.
In December 2009, Col. Shafiqa Quraisha, the head of the Gender Issues Unit of the Afghan police, described a raid in which insurgents had collected women into a room where weapons were hidden. She was able to search both the women and the room, finding the weapons. Raiding a house, when a female officer is the first one to enter, male residents cannot complain that police had violated decorum by entering a residence with women inside.
Other women have shared Malalai's tragic fate. Hanifa Safi and Najia Sediqi, heads of women affairs in Laghman Province, were assassinated in 2012. On Thursday 4 July 2013, Islam Bibi, a 37-year-old mother of three and the leading female police officer in Helmand, was gunned down on her way to work. A few months later, on 15 September, Bibi's 38-year-old successor, Negar, was also shot; she died the following day.
Death.
Malalai Kakar was shot dead between 7:00am and 8:00am in her car outside of her house while on the way to work 28 September 2008. When Kakar was killed she was reported to be either in her late 30s or early to mid 40s and had 6 children.

The Florida Bible Christian School was a preschool through twelfth grade religious school that served families from the Miami-Dade and Broward counties.
The school was accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
History.
The Florida Bible College's staff were convinced of the need to provide K-12 Christian education in South Florida. The school opened in 1976 and operated within the facilities of Florida Bible College until the fall of 1980, when the college relocated to Central Florida. At that time, Florida Bible Christian School was placed under the ministry of Florida Bible Church.
As the school improved and its programs and enrollment increased, a new location was sought. In the fall of 1983, the church and school moved to its present campus in Miramar, Florida. When the church auditorium building was completed in 1988, the school acquired fourteen more classrooms, an art room, storage rooms, a choir room, and computer labs. A media center was added in 1996, as were additional classrooms and a science lab. Additional construction and facility improvements were anticipated through the “Building a Legacy” capital campaign, which was launched in 2004.
The Florida Bible Christian School shut down operations in June 2011.

<doc id="19506230" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19506230" title="Elite pact">
Elite pact

An elite pact, settlement or political settlement is an agreement or understanding between political elites which moderates the violence and winner-takes-all nature of unrestrained conflict. Such settlements tend to transform society from an autocratic mode into more pluralistic, democratic forms.
This concept in political theory is part of elite theory and state-building. Joel Migdal has suggested that the concept of political settlements has a pedigree going back to the work of Barrington Moore. Political settlements are the frameworks for governing a state established by elites, either through formal processes or informally over time. Attempts to clearly define the concept are relatively recent and the political scientist Alan Whaites has suggested that 
Political settlements are the deeper, often unarticulated, understandings between elites that bring about the conditions to end conflict, but which also in most states prevent violent conflict from occurring. Political settlements happen because of self-interest (hope of greater benefit from a common state-building project) or due to a strong sense of shared ethos (such as religious or ideological conviction). 
He goes on to suggest that many political settlements contain the seed of their own eventual failure through inherent inflexibility. 
Most political settlements now have an explicit articulation (enshrined in an evolving
document – usually a constitution). Ultimately, however, no political settlement can
afford to be static. For a political settlement to endure it must absorb social
change, for example settlements formed by elites that exclude a growing
middle class usually become subject to a step change; a `Great Reform Act,’
suffragettes struggle or people’s movement. It has been suggested that in most
states constitutional reform has become the metaphor for the renegotiation of
power.
Whaites offers categories for different types of political settlements, including `engineered' and imposed.
Verena Fritz and Alina Rocha Menocal published a paper in 2007 arguing that political settlements are a `domain' at the heart of all state processe. They relate the concept to broader state theory (including the issues of elections and legitimacy). They stress that political settlements are not one-off events but evolve over time.
Important contributions on the establishing of political settlements in modern (particularly newly democratic) states have also been made by Thomas Carothers and Marina Ottaway of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Also of note is JC Scott's work `Seeing Like a State' which explores the routes through which political settlements in medieval Europe began to consolidate formal state structures. 
In political science the concept of `political settlements' is distinct from short-term processes aimed at elite agreements, such as a `peace process' or `peace agreement.' Peace negotiations and agreements may be part of the process of achieving a political settlement, but the settlement itself is the period of time for which an elite agreement holds, which could last for days or centuries. 
Controversially the political scientist Patrick Chabal has suggested that the concept of political settlements is often less useful than that of `political sedimentation,' the residue of elite accommodation that is left after a period of contestation or explicit conflict, (quoted from Whaites above) see also.

Neoavanguardia

The neoavanguardia ("New Vanguard") was an avant-garde Italian literary movement, characterized by a strong push towards formal experimentation in language. Authors involved include Nanni Balestrini, Edoardo Sanguineti, Umberto Eco, Antonio Porta, Elio Pagliarani, Alfredo Giuliani, Giorgio Manganelli, Luigi Malerba, Germano Lombardi, Francesco Leonetti, Alberto Gozzi, Massimo Ferretti, Franco Lucentini, Amelia Rosselli and Lello Voce among others.
Neoavanguardia poets, inspired by modernist English language writers such as Ezra Pound and TS Eliot, were opposed to the "crepuscolarismo" (intimistic view) which had characterized Italian poetry in the 20th century, and, above all, to what they defined as 'neo-capitalistic' language. The result was quasi-parodistic language that often led to meaningless verses ("non-significanza") and the so-called "art as a plaything in itself."
The movement originated as the Gruppo '63, which was founded in a hotel at Solunto, near Palermo, mostly by writers who had collaborated with the "Il Verri" literary magazine. The conference included a theatre spectacle on works by Balestrini and Sanguineti among others. The appearance of the movement spurred fierce polemics in the Italian literary world: they were accused of being "irrational formalists", "dangerous Marxist revolutionaries", "late Futurists" or the creators of a "renewed Arcadia".

Ossie Male

Ossie Male (31 December 1893–23 February 1975) was a Welsh international full back who played club rugby for Cardiff and was capped 11 times for Wales and captained his country on three occasions. In 1924, Male was at the centre of an embarrassing decision made by the Welsh Rugby Union that prevented him facing the French rugby team. Male was one of six siblings and was the youngest boy.
Rugby career.
When Male was first capped for his country, he was playing for Cross Keys. He turned out in the Welsh side that beat France at the Cardiff Arms Park on 26 February 1921, but the presence of Swansea's Joe Rees and Mountain Ash's Fred Samuel kept him out of the Wales team until 1923. Male was chosen for one game in the 1923 Five Nations Championship while at Pontypool and after moving to Cardiff, two games in the 1924 tournament; including the disastrous 1924 game against Scotland. Even though Male scored two conversions in the match, Wales were overrun as Scotland scored eight tries.
In 1924 Male was "en route" for the final game of that year's Five Nations Championship when he was involved in an embarrassing situation regarding the Welsh selection process. The Welsh team were travelling to France by train, via London, when the Welsh Rugby Union selection committee emerged from their carriage and announced that Male was to be suspended and would leave the party at Paddington. The reason for the WRU's decision was that Male had played for Cardiff within six days of the international game, breaking WRU rules. The fact that the WRU had waited until they were travelling was heavily criticised, not only to spare Male, but because the team now had to play out of position, with Penarth's Melville Rosser being pushed into the full back position, and Swansea's Joe Jones coming into three-quarters.
In 1927, Male was back in favour and back in the Welsh squad after Tommy Rees of London Welsh broke his leg at the end of 1926. Male played the entire 1927 Five Nations Championship, captaining Wales against Scotland, and in 1928, although missing the England game, he was back for the final three games of the tournament captaining Wales in two of the games. The final game was against France, and Wales lost against the French for the first time in their history. The defeat was made all the worse as French played threequarters of the game without Andre Camel. Male never played for Wales again.

Family.
Male was one of six siblings and was the youngest boy. He married his wife, Muriel Male at a young age. The couple had only one daughter, Muriel Patricia Male (Pat) in late October 1928. Patricia went on to become a teacher, and later married Frank Emery (1930–1987), fellow professor and author of "The Red Soldier". The couple had two daughters, Susan Elisabeth Emery (1961) and Caroline Mary Emery (1966).

St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament

The tournament celebrated the tenth anniversary of the St. Petersburg Chess Society. The president of the organizing committee was Peter Petrovich Saburov. Members of the committee were: Boris Maliutin, Peter Alexandrovich Saburov, and O. Sossnitzky. They intended to invite the present top twenty chess players, with world champion Emanuel Lasker, challenger José Raúl Capablanca, and the two winners of the All-Russian Masters' Tournament 1913/14 (Alexander Alekhine and Aron Nimzowitsch). Unfortunately, Amos Burn, Richard Teichmann, and Szymon Winawer declined for reasons, such as old age. From the other side, Oldřich Duras, Géza Maróczy, Carl Schlechter, Rudolf Spielmann, Savielly Tartakower, Milan Vidmar and Max Weiss could not accept due to tensions of Russia with Austria-Hungary in the year 1914. Finally, eleven top players from Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States, Cuba, and Russian Empire were accepted.
According to the unofficial Chessmetrics ratings, the tournament was (as of March 2005) the 13th-strongest tournament in history (in terms of the top players participating), and the 5th-strongest ever held up until that time.
The players were well compensated for their expenses. Lasker got an additional 4500 Rubles for playing in his first tournament in five years. Prizes or money for draws and wins had to be earned. The main event lasted from 21 April to 22 May 1914. The games were played at the St. Petersburg Chess Club in the afternoon and evening. The time control was 30 moves in 2 hours, followed by 22 moves in 1½ hours and 15 moves per hour for the rest of the game. 
Preliminaries.
The preliminaries were held as a single round-robin tournament, with the top five places qualifying for the final. Capablanca played superior chess in the preliminaries. The great surprise was the elimination of Akiba Rubinstein. The elite of Sankt Petersburg was present on a grand banquet at the end of the preliminaries. Sergei Prokofiev gave a piano recital.
The results and standings:
Final.
The final tournament was a double-round tournament among the five players. Since the results of the preliminaries carried over into the finals, Capablanca with a 1½-point lead was a heavy favorite to win the tournament. In the first half of the finals, Lasker narrowly escaped a loss against Capablanca, which would have virtually decided the tournament. Lasker made up half a point of the difference between himself and Capablanca, with the scores standing at Capablanca 11, Lasker 10, Alekhine 8½, Marshall 7, Tarrasch 6½.
In the 19th round, Lasker won a now-famous game against Capablanca with the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, trading queens on the sixth move (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.d4 exd4 6.Qxd4 Qxd4 7.Nxd4) and then outplaying Capablanca in the endgame. Luděk Pachman remarks that Lasker's choice of opening was a masterstroke, since Capablanca was intent on simplifying the game to obtain a draw, and the line Lasker chose requires Black to play actively in order to exploit his advantage of the bishop pair and not allow White to exploit his superior pawn structure. Capablanca, intent on avoiding complications, played too passively and was routed by Lasker. In the following round, a shaken Capablanca lost as White from a superior position against Tarrasch. This allowed Lasker (who scored a remarkable 7/8) to overtake Capablanca, winning the tournament by a half point.
Lasker won 1200 rubles, Capablanca 800 rubles, Alekhine 500 rubles, Tarrasch 300 rubles, and Marshall 250 rubles. In addition, there was a Brilliancy Prize Fund, of which Capablanca was awarded 125 rubles for his win over Bernstein, Tarrasch was awarded 75 rubles (Second Prize) for his win over Nimzowitsch, and Blackburne won 50 rubles (Special Brilliancy Prize) for his win over Nimzowitsch. The prize fund was more than covered by the record "gate" of 6,000 rubles from the spectators.

UGENE

UGENE is free open-source cross-platform bioinformatics software.
It integrates dozens of well-known biological tools and algorithms, providing both graphical user and command line interfaces. Using UGENE Workflow Designer, one can arrange the required tools and algorithms into a workflow schema.
In order to provide maximum possible performance UGENE utilizes multicore CPUs and GPUs to optimize some of its computational routines. Another way to speed up computations is to use Amazon EC2 cloud resources.
Key features.
The software supports the following features:
User interface.
The software has three main views to display biological data on the user's screen.
UGENE Workflow Designer.
UGENE Workflow Designer allows creating and running complex computational workflow schemas.
The elements that a schema consists of correspond to the bulk of algorithms integrated into UGENE. Using the Workflow Designer one can also create custom workflow elements.
The workflow schemas can be run both locally and remotely, either using the graphical interface or launched from the command line.
UGENE Query Designer.
UGENE Query Designer allows a user to analyze a nucleotide sequence using different algorithms (Repeats finder, ORF finder, Weight matrix matching, etc.) at the same time imposing constraints on the positional relationship of the results obtained from the algorithms.
A schema of the algorithms and constraints is either created from the GUI or edited as a plain text.
The results are saved as a set of annotations to a specified file in the GenBank format.
UGENE Assembly Browser.
UGENE Assembly Browser project was started in 2010 as an entry for Illumina iDEA Challenge 2011. The Assembly Browser allows a user to visualize and browse large (up to hundreds of millions of short reads) next generation sequence assemblies. The only format currently supported is BAM (which is the binary version of SAM). To browse assembly data in UGENE an input file should be converted to a UGENE database file. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages are that the conversion may take time for a large BAM file and there should be enough disk space to store the database. On the other hand this allows to overview the whole assembly, navigate in it and go to well-covered regions rather rapidly. In addition before the conversion the user can choose contigs to be extracted from the BAM file. By this mean it is possible to open big files such as 1000 Genomes Project data.
Release cycle.
UGENE is primarily developed by Unipro LLC. Each iteration lasts about 6 weeks. By the end of iteration a release comes out. One can also download a development snapshot of the software.
The features to be included into the next release are mostly initiated by users.

Umikaze-class destroyer

The were a class of two destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were the first large destroyers designed for open ocean service to be built in Japan.
Background.
The "Umikaze"-class destroyers were designed after the Russo-Japanese War, as the Imperial Japanese Navy realized that the vessels in its current fleet of destroyers were too small and poorly designed for extended “blue water” operation.
Two vessels were built, based largely on British designs, one at Maizuru Naval Arsenal and the other at the Mitsubishi shipyards in Nagasaki.
Design.
The "Umikaze"-class ships were based largely on the Royal Navy Tribal-class destroyers. In terms of displacement, each vessel was almost three times larger than the previous destroyers in the Japanese Navy.
Externally, the design retained the four-smokestacks of the , however, internally the coal-fired triple expansion steam engines, were replaced with heavy oil-fired Parsons steam turbine engines, which was a first for Japan. The rated power of 20,500 shp gave the vessels a high speed of , however fuel consumption severely limited range.
Armament was increased over the previous classes, with a pair of QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I - IV guns, with one gun mounted on a small shelter forward and another on the quarterdeck and five QF 3 inch 12 pounder guns mounted staggered to port and starboard. The number of torpedoes was initially three in unreloadable tubes; but this was quickly changed to two in reloadable tubes in operational service.
Operational history.
The "Umikaze"-class destroyers proved to be largely experimental ships. The use of Parsons steam turbines pushed the design to the limits of capability of contemporary engineering and production technology, and the engines were plagued with maintenance issues, as well as tremendous fuel consumption. In an effort to reduce running expenses and to increase range, the boilers were modified from all heavy oil to two heavy oil and four coal-fired boilers. Even with the modification, the "Umikaze" vessels were largely retained for coastal patrol duties.
The "Umikaze" ships were rated at first-class destroyers on August 28, 1912, and served to June 1, 1930 when both were converted to minesweepers. Both were subsequently scrapped in 1936.

SANReN

SANReN (South African National Research Network) is a project to create a new National Research and Education Network in South Africa. However, unlike most other NRENs, SANReN will provide its clients with both connectivity to the world's research networks as well as commodity Internet access. 
In 2005, the South African Department of Science and Technology obtained funding from treasury for a ZAR 365 million, three-year project to build a world-class National Research and Education Network to further the country's research aims. The DST then tasked the Meraka Institute with the planning and deployment of this network, to be completed by the middle of 2010.
An initial Request for Information was published in 2005, followed by two Request for Proposals in 2006. The original proposal called for inter-institution links of up to 500Mbit/s and international bandwidth of 1Gbit/s. Due to budget constraints, the implementation of the network proceeded in phases with a prioritisation of institutions, such as the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory site, that were of particular strategic importance to the South African science initiatives.
The scope of SANReN's network has changed somewhat since the original RFPs were published, with most sites now expecting to connect at speeds of up to 10 Gbit/s. With further phases of the project coming on line, most of the public universities in the country will be included. Initially international Internet connectivity will be provided over the SEACOM submarine fibre cable, in a deal unrelated to the original SANReN RFP. It is expected that SANReN will also take advantage of other cable projects once they come online.
Late in 2007, Meraka announced that it had partnered with the then provider of academic networking in South Africa, TENET. Under their memorandum of understanding, Meraka would build SANReN and TENET would operate it. This arrangement is very similar to the relationship between GÉANT and DANTE in Europe.
As of September 2008, SANReN has connected three higher educational institutes in Gauteng: the University of the Witwatersrand, the University of Johannesburg, the University of Pretoria, the Tshwane University of Technology and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (of which Meraka is part).

Mohammad Al Gaz

Mohammad bin Abdallah bin Mohammad Al Gaz (), was a significant figure in Dubai politics and business during the thirty year period after the 1950s.
Born in what is now Dubai, U.A.E., circa 1930, Al Gaz was from the Al Bu Falasah family, a sub-sect of the larger Bani Yas tribe, which has ruled Dubai for almost two hundred years.
Often pictured in photographs with the late ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Al Gaz's role in politics was primarily as a friend and aide to the late ruler, and later as the first Chairman of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates.
As the first major businessman from the ruling tribe of Dubai, Al Gaz was part of a small group of highly ambitious businessmen in the 1960s who pursued the goal of modernizing the city, notables of them include Al Gaz's longtime business partner Jumaa Al Majid, Majed Al Futtaim and his cousin Abdullah Al Futtaim, Abdullah and Saif Ahmad Al Ghurair, and Obeid Al Mulla. In his early efforts after the federation of the country to bring in foreign companies, Al Gaz's holding company, United Arab Agencies, acquired a large number franchises, including Pepsi Co., Nissan Motors, Royal Philips Electronics, Opel Cars (owned by General Motors), etc. By the 1980s, Al Gaz was also a major property owner with approximately 40 high-story buildings developed and owned by his private company. In addition to his business interests, Al Gaz was a devoted philanthropist and is credited with the development of the first private charitable society in Dubai's history.
Al Gaz dropped out of the public eye in the 1980s, during which he retired from public service and divested from his former interests in retail franchises, although he maintained a real estate holding firm. He is often recognized on Dubai roads by his unique license plate - Dubai code A no. 2. In his old age, Al Gaz continues to host guests in his "mejlis," where it is said the current ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum, as well as his children sometime visit to pay their respects.
Succeeded by eight sons, Mohammad Al Gaz relinquished the control and management of his holding firm to his eldest son, Abdallah Al Gaz, during his lifetime.
Trivia.
Al Gaz was one of the passengers on the doomed BI Dara voyage, which was bombed in 1961 in Dubai waters.

Tshifhiwa Munyai

Tshifhiwa Munyai is a professional boxer from South Africa who has competed in the bantamweight and featherweight divisions. He is the current holder of the WBA inter-continental bantamweight title and is a former holder of the Commonwealth bantamweight title.
Professional Boxing Career.
Early Professional Career.
Munyai spent the early part of his career boxing in the townships of his native country South Africa. He had compiled a record of 10-0-1 by the time he left the country to box abroad for the first time as a professional.
His big opportunity came when he was given the opportunity in June 2006 to fight England's Martin Power for the vacant Commonwealth bantamweight title. Power came into the contest with an undefeated record of 19-0 and was the holder of the British bantamweight title at the time. Munyai stunned the boxing world by beating Power with a 9th round TKO in London's York Hall.
Commonwealth champion.
Following his victory Munyai returned to the York Hall to defend against former Commonwealth Flyweight champion Lee Haskins. He won the contest in the 6th round when referee Micky Vann stepped in stop the contest after Haskins came off worst after being caught with a number of body shots. In January 2007 Munyai once again met Martin Power this time at the Goresbrook Leisure Center in Dagenham. This time the victory was emphatic with Munyai winning four one sided rounds before Power was pulled by his corner in the fourth. Power claimed in an interview with the BBC that an elbow injury had hampered his performance saying ""I picked up an elbow injury after the second round and it was restricting me. It was hard enough to fight him with two hands, but with just one I was struggling. I wanted to carry on but my corner wouldn't let me."" A confident Munyai said simply ""I knew from the first fight that I could beat him and, if anything, this fight was even easier for me.""
WBA Inter-continental champion.
Following his victories Munyai fought twice more in the UK and moved up to featherweight with 8 round wins over Harry Ramogoadi and Abdul Tebazalwa before returning to South Africa as a bantamweight. In February 2008 he challenged the Argentinian Julio David Roque Ler for the WBA Inter-continental bantamweight title in Bloemfontein and came out a unanimous points winner. In July 2008 Munyai returned to the UK and to the Goresbrook Leisure Centre the scene of his second victory over Power. Returning featherweight he suffered his first defeat as a professional losing to the Ghanaian boxer Osumana Akaba over 8 rounds. After the fight Akaba responded to comments that he had just been there to make up the numbers saying "“I know that people didn't rate my record and thought they were going to use me as a stepping stone, just as a journeyman. I knew going into the fight that he'd beaten a lot of good people, but they were afraid of him.”"
Munyai returned to action back in South Africa in November 2008 and defeated fellow countryman Bongani Mahangu in a return to bantamweight. The fight was the first defence of Munyai's WBA intercontinental title and ended with a split decision win over Maglangu who at the time was also the WBA Pan African bantamweight title holder. Munyai next boxed in July 2009 and in a non title fight defeated Galley Cudjoe with a first round stoppage in Johannesburg. 
He made the second defence of his intercontinental title on 27 February 2010 defeating the Philippines Daniel Ferreras at the Kempton Park in Gauteng over 12 rounds. On 28 July 2010 he stopped Ghanain Prosper Ankrah in the 3rd round of another non-title fight at the Emperor's Palace and then just a week later on 8 August 2010 found himself in the frame for a trip to Mexico City and a shot at the vacant WBC Silver bantamweight against Mexico's Cristian Esquivel. Despite the shot at the title coming at short notice Munyai traveled to Mexico and went the full 12 round distance although ended up losing for the second time in his career.
IBO super bantamweight champion.
On 26 March 2011 Munyai fought Philippine boxer Danilo Pena at the Kempton Park winning on all the judges scorecards to win the vacant IBO super bantamweight championship.

Charles Thorp Comprehensive School

Charles Thorp Comprehensive School (formerly Ryton Comprehensive School) is a secondary school in Ryton, Tyne and Wear, England. The school teaches students who come mostly from the local Ryton and Crawcrook area, though some students residing in Greenside, Prudhoe and Winlaton also attended.
The school is named after Charles Thorp who was a rector of the parish of Ryton, and later, Archdeacon of Durham and the first warden of the University of Durham.
History.
Ryton Comprehensive School was a popular oversubscribed school but was nevertheless threatened with closure as part of a review of secondary education in Gateshead in 2009. It was eventually decided that the school should remain open. The school's rating declined during this time from "good, with outstanding features" (Ofsted, 2008) to receiving a Notice to Improve (2011) which was removed in March 2012 when the school was judged Satisfactory.
At the turn of the century, the school was fortunate to benefit from a £3 million investment by a mixture of Gateshead LEA and the Big Lottery Fund in enhanced facilities. That development saw the construction of an additional sports hall, three new science laboratories, a purpose-built drama studio, a suite of music rooms, enhanced art and graphics areas and new modern foreign language classrooms. More recently the LA invested £2 million in a new classroom block housing Learning Support and Art/Media.
The school also boasts a state-of-the-art Millennium Centre, providing excellent facilities for independent study, and an extensive range of literature.
In 2011, the school welcomed year 10 pupils from nearby Hookergate school in High Spen, which was closed on August 31 due to falling numbers, and a larger number of year 7 pupils from a widened catchment area. The Hookergate site remained open for a further academic year (2011–12) to provide education for years 8, 9 and 11. 
To acknowledge and celebrate the changes a new identity was developed for the school which change its name to Charles Thorp Comprehensive School in September 2011. The uniform also changed from a maroon blazer, blue shirt, blue striped tie and grey trousers to a blue shirt, grey jumper and black trousers.
The school today.
The school building will undergo further development under a central Government building scheme in 2015. 
The school also enjoys a long-running partnership with local sports clubs Ryton F.C., Ryton Rugby Club and Ryton Cricket club.

Lo Russo clan

The Lo Russo clan is a Neapolitan Camorra clan operating on its territory within the city of Naples, concentrated specifically in the area of Miano.
History.
The Lo Russo clan was formed in the late seventies by the Lo Russo brothers, Salvatore, Vincenzo and Giuseppe aka ""i Capitoni"" (The Captains). 
After its formation, it immediately merged into the Nuova Famiglia (NF), a federation of Anti-Cutolo Camorra clans consisting of Michele Zaza (a Camorra boss with strong ties with Cosa Nostra), the Gionta clan from Torre Annunziata, the Nuvoletta clan from Marano, Antonio Bardellino from San Cipriano d'Aversa and Casal di Principe, the Alfieri clan led by Carmine Alfieri, the Galasso clan of Poggiomarino led by Pasquale Galasso, the Giuliano clan from Naples' quarter Forcella led by Luigi Giuliano and the Vollaro clan from Portici led by Luigi Vollaro. It was formed to contrast the growing power of Raffaele Cutolo's Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO).
The war against the NCO resulted in the victory of the Lo Russo's and other NF clans. However, the NF alliance soon disintegrated into many feuding clans, with a war breaking out between the Casalesi and Nuvoletta clans towards the end of 1983. After the end of the NF alliance, the Lo Russo clan joined the newly formed Secondigliano Alliance), a coalition of powerful Camorra clans which controls drug trafficking and the extortion rackets in many suburbs of Naples.
During the Scampia feud, the Lo Russo clan had a role as an intermediary between the Di Lauro clan and the so-called "secessionists" (Italian "scissionisti"), a breakaway fraction from the Di Lauro clan in the northern suburbs of Naples that tried to assert its control over drugs and prostitution rackets in the area. The Lo Russo clan, for its good organization, also had a leading role in a conflict with the Stabile, both in the Sanita neighborhood, where Salvatore Torino has created a division within the Misso clan. 
On August, 2007, the boss Salvatore Lo Russo was arrested by the carabinieri in his home at Capodimonte, together with his protégé Rafaelle Perfetto. The carabinieri executed an order of custody issued by the District Anti-Mafia Directorate Parthenopean for conspiracy to commit murder and other Camorra-type crimes.

He has also built a five strings fretless bass for Trevor Dunn of the American band Mr. Bungle.
Construction.
All instruments are built on individual basis with each customer. Lawrence avoids the use of endangered woods and advocates the use of "Responsibly Harvested" rain forest hardwoods for his instruments. Bodies are usually made in Ash, Alder, or Mahogany but other types of wood are available if the customer demands it (such as Jamaican blue wood
. All necks are made of eastern hard rock maple and is usually fitted with fretboards in grenadillo or katalox. All bass guitars can be ordered in different finishes, with or without frets and with a variety of different pickups and preamps.

Buses in Prague

The bus service in Prague is provided by several transport operators, chiefly by Dopravní podnik hlavního města Prahy, a.s. ("Prague Public Transit Co. Inc."). The base system of metropolitan and suburban transport is Pražská integrovaná doprava (Prague Integrated Transport) organized by Prague municipal organization ROPID but several urban and suburban lines don't belong to it. PID system includes also metro and tram lines, Vltava ferries, a funicular and partly railway transport.
History.
The first buses in Prague were experimentally operated in 1908 in the Malá Strana district, but due to unreliable technology at the time it was declared a failure after 20 months. Regular service was started on 20 June 1925 and is in operation continuously since.
In 1990s and 2000s, metropolitan system was integrated and expanded with suburban transport as Pražská integrovaná doprava (PID, Prague Integrated Transport). Some directions (Kladno) remain not integrated in this system. 
The buses are fulfilling many different roles in the Prague's public transport. Many lines serve as connections between the metro and housing quarters. There are also plans to gradually introduce trunk services, similar to bus rapid transit systems in Latin America.
The buses are fulfilling many different roles in the Prague's public transport and they were several times changed during years. Many lines serve as connections from housing areas to the metro, railway or tram stations, many lines serves as local net or tangential connection (metro and tram lines are prevalently diagonal). Main terminals of metropolitan buses are near metro stations: Černý Most, Zličín, Háje, Letňany, Nové Butovice, Želivského, Českomoravská, Kačerov, Budějovická, Depo Hostivař, Dejvická, Na Knížecí (Anděl), Skalka, Palmovka, Nádraží Holešovice, Florenc etc. Suburban and long-distance buses use some of them. The main stations of long-distance buses are ÚAN Florenc, Černý Most and Zličín. 
Since 2008, ROPID is implementing a plan to differentiate rachial lines with small intervals and articulated buses. Some telematic systems are widely implemented (GPS monitoring, traffic signal preference).
Line numbering.
Bus lines belonging to the PID system are numbered within number series:

Swedish Pro Tennis Championships is a now defunct tennis championship only played in 1972 and 1973.
History.
The "Swedish Pro Tennis Championships" were created in Gothenburg, Sweden, as part of the 1972 WCT circuit, as one of the four non-American events of the tour, with the Canada International of Essen, Germany, and the Rotterdam Indoors of Rotterdam, Netherlands. The first tournament in 1972 (which field included a sixteen-year-old Björn Borg), saw the victory of eventual WCT year-end No. 1 John Newcombe, and the second, of 1973's Group A leader Stan Smith. Like many events of the WCT, the "Swedish Pro" was quickly discontinued as the circuit was searching for new locations to improve its list of tournaments. Gothenburg continued to host Sweden's national championships, as well as Davis Cup ties, and several exhibitions, like the 1976-Rod Laver/Björn Borg challenge match, but the city's international tennis tournament was never revived.

The Titan Wind Project is 25MW wind farm with a proposed expansion to 5,050 MW, formerly known as Rolling Thunder, based in South Dakota. The project developers, Clipper Windpower and BP Alternative Energy, expect to build Titan in several phases and, when completed, it will be one of the largest wind farms in the world.
The complete wind farm would use up to 2,020 of Clipper's Liberty 2.5 MW wind turbines. However, this is unlikely, as Clipper Windpower has since ceased production of wind turbines due to financial problems.
Production.
Operating at full capacity, the project would be able to supply the electricity for 100% of the households in the state several times over. South Dakota's entire electricity consumption in 2005 was 9.811 TWh. At an assumed capacity factor of 25% (probably conservative for windy South Dakota), a 5.05 GW nameplate capacity would correspond to an annual generation of: 
Phase I.
Construction of phase I began in 2009 on a site in Hand County in the Ree Hills south of Ree Heights. The project was complete by the end of the year. Phase I consists of 10 Liberty C89 2.5 MW wind turbines for a combined nameplate capacity of 25 MW. Northwestern Energy has a long-term power purchase agreement.
Renewable Energy Objective.
In 2008, the South Dakota legislature passed a Renewable Energy Objective. The bill is mostly a symbolic gesture, as it's not a mandate, only an objective. Furthermore the objective is only 10% by 2015. Considering that hydroelectric dams already produce about 45% of the state's electricity, that objective will likely be met.

Maiden Lane (Manhattan)

Maiden Lane is an east-west street in the Financial District of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Its eastern terminus is at South Street, near the South Street Seaport. It continues west, terminating at Broadway, near the World Trade Center site.
The street received its name in New Amsterdam, as "Maagde Paatje", a "footpath used by lovers along a rippling brook" according to the "WPA Guide to New York City", a "pebbly brook" that ran from Nassau Street to the East River. where wives and daughters washed linen according to the city historians Edwin Burrows and Mike Wallace. 
The street was formally laid out in 1696, the first street north of still-palisaded Wall Street. By 1728, a market was held at the foot of Maiden Lane, where it ended at Front Street facing the East River; by 1823, when it was demolished and disbanded, the Fly Market, selling meat, country produce and fish under its covered roofs, was New York's oldest. 
In September 1732, a company of professional actors arrived from London and took an upstairs room near the junction of Pearl Street which was fitted up with a platform stage, and marked the origin of professional theater in New York; by the time the company was disbanded in 1734, their building was known as the Play House.
In the Spring of 1790, Thomas Jefferson rented a house at 57 Maiden Lane when he moved to New York to serve as the Secretary of State under George Washington. 
Maiden Lane was a street of shops by the end of the 18th century, even before the new fashion for multi-paned shop windows caught on in the city. In 1827 the skylit New York Arcade, banking on the fashionable success of London's Burlington Arcade (1819), spanned the block between Maiden Lane and John Street east of Broadway with forty smart shops; "it had not the success that had been anticipated," Charles Haynes Haswell recalled, "and survived but a few years". Maiden Lane was soon one of the first city streets to be lit with gas lamps. 
The slip at the foot of Main Lane was infilled in the early 19th century, accounting for the widened stretch in the last blocks before South Street, the present waterfront. The water of the erstwhile brook ran down the center of the street, until 1827, when a suggestion was made in Common Council to close it over and lead rainwater to the side gutters.
One of the handful of mid-19th century commercial structures still standing in the Financial District, is the building 90-94 Maiden Lane, built for Roosevelt & Son, with a cast-iron front (attributed to Charles Wright, 1870–71) by Daniel D. Badger.
Until the early 20th century Maiden Lane was the center of the jewelry district, which relocated on West 47th Street. At Broadway, the bronze and glass clock embedded in the sidewalk by William Barthman Jewelers still keeps time; in 1946 the New York police department estimated that it was walked on by 51,000 people every weekday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

The Death of Richie

The Death of Richie is a made-for-TV movie drama which premiered on the NBC television network on January 10, 1977. It is based on "Richie", a nonfiction book by Thomas Thompson about the 1972 death of George Richard "Richie" Diener, Jr. at the hands of his father, who was ultimately not charged with the shooting death of his son.
Plot.
The film opens with a scene of a burial in a large suburban cemetery, with mourners, many of them young people, surrounding a casket while a minister prays. An older couple dressed in black is closest to the casket, suggesting that they are the deceased's parents. The grief-stricken father weeps openly as he is comforted by his wife.
The story then cuts from the cemetery and to a car swerving erratically on a street, focusing on a young man, 17-year-old Richie Werner (Robby Benson), who is doing drugs in the car with his three friends. The driver, Brick, is then pulled over for his erratic driving. The police officer tells Brick he is willing to let him off the hook as a favor...and that he expects favors in return for those he does favors for. Brick agrees.
This is the beginning of a series of episodes that bring Richie into conflict with his father, George (Ben Gazzara), a stern man who loves his son, but has trouble expressing his feelings. Eileen Brennan plays Richie's loving but weak mother Carol, and Lance Kerwin plays his younger brother Russell, whom Richie, despite his demons, is very protective of.
Both men make genuine attempts to meet each other halfway, yielding some success, with Richie getting a job (but loses it later after Brick and his thugs show up at Richie's job) and George helping his son get closer to Shiela (Cynthia Eilbacher), a girl from school that Richie likes. However, the relationship between George and Richie worsens as social pressures and personal failings drive Richie deeper into his drug addiction.
The interaction between father and son continues to deteriorate, largely due to Richie's escalating drug abuse and his father's unwillingness to enter family counseling.
The movie's climax comes when George intervenes by informing the police of his son's activities, in a desperate attempt to save his life at all costs. Richie confronts his father in a drug-induced rage (from ingestion of what is referred to as "reds", usually slang for barbiturates
), threatening him with an awl. George retreats to the basement in the family's home, where Richie follows him. George retrieves a revolver from his toolbox and aims it at Richie, but does not fire it, cocking the hammer back in an attempt to convince his son that he is not bluffing. Richie screams repeatedly for his father to shoot him. George manages to overpower Richie by knocking the awl from his hand, but Richie retreats upstairs and returns to the basement with a pair of scissors and taunts his father over and over again, daring him to shoot him, approaching him closer, thinking that George doesn't have the nerve to do it.
With a steady hand, George pulls the trigger. A blinding flash from the gun's barrel then morphs into a bouquet of flowers on a mahogany casket in the same cemetery, surrounded by the same mourners in black. Following Psalm 23, a brief eulogy is read by Shiela:
The movie ends with a brief written epilogue over a still shot of George placing a rose on Richie's casket, stating that a grand jury voted unanimously not to indict George Werner for the shooting death of his son, and that he lives as a free man.

National Forest Corporation (Chile)

The National Forest Corporation ("Corporación Nacional Forestal", or "Conaf") is a Chilean government agency that is part of the Ministry of Agriculture of Chile. It administers the forest policies of Chile and promotes the development of the sector with sustainable forest management. Conaf was created on May 13, 1970 as the "Reforestation Corporation" ("Corporación de Reforestación"). In 1973 it acquired its current powers, organization and name. Conaf is also the governing body of all National parks of Chile, including those without forest or major vegetation such as Llullaillaco National Park. In 1976 it adopted Forestín, a coypu, as mascot. 
Technically, CONAF is currently NOT a Chilean government agency. It is a private corporation ("corporación de derecho privado") and wholly dependent upon the Ministry of Agriculture. The function that the present corporation performs was under the name "Reforestation Corporation" ("Corporación de Reforestación") (COREF) which was created in 1970. 
In 1984, under Chilean law Nº 18.348, a move was made to modify the private corporation status of CONAF and make it a government agency. However, as of October 2012, such a status change has not taken place. 
Despite the "private corporation" legal status of CONAF, its executive director is appointed by the president of Chile. 
In October of 2012 the Chilean senate considered, and rejected, a proposal to convert the "private corporation" nature of CONAF to that of a public (government) agency. The rejected proposal would have created a National Forest Service "(Servicio Nacional Forestal"). During the legislative proceedings, there was testimony that addressed the "anomolous" nature of a private corporation performing functions that should be performed by a wholly government agency or agencies.

After her graduation she worked as a doctor of Romance studies at The George Washington University (1966–1972) and at the World Bank. In 1972, she was employed by the Center for Hellenic Studies as an administrative worker. Between 1987 and 1992, she worked at the US branch of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and as a "Voice of America" journalist. From 1972 on, she was a member of the Bulgarian National Committee in the United States, founded by her father.
Dimitrova returned to Bulgaria in 1992 (after the Revolutions of 1989 had made it a democratic country) and joined the country's political life. She founded and headed the conservative agrarian party Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union–People's Union from 1992 to 1997. She has been a member of the National Assembly of Bulgaria's 37th—40th sessions, from 1995 until today.

Alexander Park Leitch, Baron Leitch (b. Fife, Scotland 20 October 1947) is a British Labour peer and Chairman of Bupa and Intrinsic Financial Services. Having just stepped down as Deputy Chairman at Lloyds Banking Group plc and as Chairman of Scottish Widows plc, he is currently adviser to Lloyds Banking Group’s Chairman and to the CEO. He is also a Trustee of the Lloyds Banking Group Charitable Foundation. He is Chancellor of Carnegie College, Chairman of a new think tank called ‘The Centre for Modern Families’ and strategic adviser to a Prince of Wales charity called PRIME.
Lord Leitch's previous experience includes:
Biography.
Leitch is the son of a Scottish coal miner and endured a childhood in near poverty following the Second World War. He was left paralysed down one side of his body during his 30s due to a lesion on his brain and thus "learned from personal experience the value of life insurance." He was educated at Dunfermline High School and was offered a place at university two years early, at just 16 years of age. However, he turned his place down and instead headed to London to work in the IT department of an insurance company. In 1965, Sandy started his career as a computer programmer, writing the first ever life assurance ‘search engine’ program in 1967. He remained in the insurance industry throughout his career, rising to become Chief Executive of Allied Dunbar before it was eventually merged with Zurich Financial Services in 1998. He was then appointed Chief Executive of Zurich Financial Services UK and retired in 2004.
Leitch became a life peer as Baron Leitch, of Oakley in Fife on 7 June 2004. In 2000, prior to becoming a peer, Leitch headed the New Deal scheme which aimed to encourage companies to take on school leavers. Having demonstrated his commitment to public service, he became Chairman of the National Employment Panel in 2004 and also led the Leitch Review of Skills which was published on 5 December 2006. The objective of the review was "to identify the UK's optimal skills mix for 2020 to maximise economic growth, productivity and social justice, set out the balance of responsibility for achieving that skills profile and consider the policy framework required to support it."
2004 Blunkett scandal.
Leitch became involved in the 2004 scandal over the then Home Secretary's extra-marital affairs. It was revealed by the British press that Leitch had had a relationship, during 1999, with Kimberley Quinn, the publisher who later had an affair with David Blunkett.
Relationship with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.
Lord Leitch is a close friend of Tony Blair and it is suspected that he helped Blair to gain work with Zurich following his retirement as Prime Minister. He became one of Blair's "most trusted business advisers" during his tenure at No. 10. Leitch is also described as a "confidante" of Gordon Brown.
Personal life.
Leitch has been married twice: firstly to Valerie Hodson, whom he divorced in 1997, and secondly to Noelle Dowd in 2003. He has three daughters from his first marriage, and a young daughter from his second. He lives in South Kensington, London and has a home in Edinburgh.
He is a keen follower of his local Scottish football team (Dunfermline Athletic) as well as having a passion for antique collecting and fine malt whisky.
He is a Freeman of the City of London. He has an honorary doctorate in Business Administration and a Fellowship from Carnegie College.

<doc id="19506896" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19506896" title="Ostrea conchaphila">
Ostrea conchaphila

The Olympia oyster, "Ostrea conchaphila", is the native oyster of the Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to Mexico. The name is derived from the important 19th-century oyster industry near Olympia, Washington, in Puget Sound.
Distribution.
Distinct from "Ostrea lurida", which exists north of Baja California, "O. conchaphila" lives in the Pacific Ocean south of Baja California.
Use by Native Americans.
Native American peoples consumed "O. conchaphila" everywhere it was found, with consumption in San Francisco Bay so intense, enormous middens of oyster shells were piled over thousands of years. One of the largest such mounds, the Emeryville Shellmound, near the mouth of Temescal Creek and the eastern end of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge, is now buried under the Bay Street shopping center.
Decline and return in California.
"O. conchaphila" nearly disappeared from San Francisco Bay following overharvest during the California Gold Rush (1848-50s) and massive silting from hydraulic mining in California's Sierra Nevada (1850s-1880s). California's most valuable fishery from the 1880s-1910s was based on imported Atlantic oysters, not the absent native. But in the 1990s, "O. conchaphila" once again appeared in San Francisco Bay near the Chevron Richmond Refinery in Richmond, California.
Restoration efforts.
Species restoration projects for the Olympia oyster funded by the US Government are active in Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay. An active restoration project is taking place in Liberty Bay, Washington. This Puget Sound location is the home of an old and new Olympia oyster population. Intertidal areas with native oyster populations or evidence of past populations are strong candidates for re-introduction. The re-establishment of the population is currently threatened by the invasive Japanese oyster drill "Ocinabrina inorata". This species preys on the oysters by drilling a hole between the two valves and digesting the oyster's tissues. "O. inorata" is a threat to the oyster especially in areas with low populations of the mussel "Mytilis".
The Nature Conservancy of Oregon also has an ongoing restoration project at Netarts Bay, Oregon.

Jan Erasmus Reyning

Jan Erasmus Reyning (1640–1697) was a Dutch pirate, privateer and naval officer.
Jan Erasmus Reyning was born in Flushing in 1640 as the son of a Danish mariner and a Zeeland woman. As a boy, he went to sea with his father and later started a seaman's career of his own. He was taken prisoner during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667), and later served as an "engagé" (servant) on a French plantation on the island of Hispaniola. Around 1667 he became a buccaneer, i.e. a hunter in central Hispaniola, and around 1669 he started a career as a pirate or filibuster.
Although documentary evidence is limited, Reyning is believed to have fought as a privateer captain with French or English letters of marque between 1669 and 1672. His partner was one Jelle Lecat (probably born in Frisia as Jelle de Kat). Reyning must have co-operated with renowned pirates as Roche Braziliano and Henry Morgan. According to reliable Spanish documents, Reyning offered his services to his former Spanish enemies at Campeche around January 1672. The Spanish accepted his services and he even took catechisation lessons from a Catholic priest. later that year, when Reyning learned that his home country, The Netherlands, was at war with England and France (in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War), he sailed to the Dutch colony of Curaçao. He became a sort of Robin Hood for Curaçao that was threatened by many enemies.
In his later years Reyning was a Dutch gentleman and marine officer who died at full sea in the Gulf of Biskay in a storm on 2 February 1697.

Czech Republic–Germany relations

Czech–German relations have a long and complicated history.
There had been a German minority in Bohemia and Moravia ("Czech lands") for centuries. The regions later called Sudetenland were situated on the borders of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which also consisted of Moravia (and later Silesia) and was in turn part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Slavic people settled in the area from the 6th century. After the extinction of the Czech Přemyslid dynasty, the kingdom was ruled by the Luxemburgs, later the Jagiellonians and finally the Habsburgs. Starting from the 13th century onwards the border regions of Bohemia and Moravia, called Sudetenland in the 20th century, were settled by Germans, who were invited by the originally Slavic Bohemian nobility.
The Czech estates were defeated at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 and after Thirty Years' War from 2.6 million inhabitants of Bohemia and Moravia, here remained only approximately 1.55 million inhabitants. Renewed Constitution of 1627 () the German language was established as a second official language in the Czech lands. The Czech language remained the first language in the kingdom. Both German and Latin were widely spoken among the ruling classes, although German became increasingly dominant, while Czech was spoken in much of the countryside. In Habsburg Monarchy, especially from the 17th century onwards the German-speaking population became the privileged ethnic and linguistic group, while Czechs felt increasingly sidelined.
The Habsburgs integrated the Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia into their monarchy, of which it remained a part until the modern nationalism gained power in the 19th century. However, Czech kings continues to be crowned within the Kingdom of Bohemia until the establishment of Czechoslovakia. Conflicts between Czech and German nationalists emerged, for instance in the revolution of 1848: while the German-speaking population wanted to participate in the building of a German nation state, the Czech-speaking population insisted on keeping Bohemia out of such plans.
The relationship between the German-speaking and Czech-speaking populations radically changed after World War I when independent Czechoslovakia was established. The ultimately successful Czechoslovak demands for the German majority territories were viewed favorably by France and the UK, but negatively by the U.S. who favored the Sudeten German demands for self-determination (But Czechoslovakia could not exist without so called Sudetenland).
Before the 1938 German annexation of the Sudetenland, roughly 20% of the population in Czechoslovakia had been ethnic Germans.
In the Czech lands they constituted more than 30% of the population. Ethnic German nationalists backed by Hitler demanded the union of German-speaking districts with Germany. Threatening war, Hitler seized through the Munich Agreement in September 1938 the cession of the Bohemian, Moravian and Czech-Silesian borderlands: Sudetenland. In November 1938, Czechoslovakia was forced by Germany and Italy to also cede southern Slovakia (one third of Slovak territory) to Hungary. The Czechs in the greatly weakened Czechoslovak Republic were forced to grant major concessions to the non-Czechs. Eventually Germany seized all of Czechoslovakia.
Reasons for the expulsion have the roots in the irredentist "Heim ins Reich" (Back to Reich) policy of Sudeten German Party () that was Pan-German and Nazi oriented. The SdP was from 1935 financed and supported by Nazi Germany. From 1937 the leaders of SdP coordinated the policy with Nazi leaders in order to destroy the Czechoslovak state and its parliamentary democracy and "reintegrate Bohemia and Moravia back to Nazi German Empire". This Nazi German policy took the form of so-called "Grundplanung OA" (Basic planning) from summer 1938 (which included extermination of Czech nation) and later during German occupation of Czechoslovakia it was part of interior policy of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia within "Generalplan Ost".
Leader of SdP Konrad Henlein met with Adolf Hitler in Berlin on March 28, 1938, where he was instructed to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On April 24, the SdP issued the so-called Carlsbad Decrees, demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess Nazi ideology.
The policy of SdP succeed in September 1938 by annexation of Sudetenland into Nazi Germany enabled by the Munich Agreement that caused shock and indignation of the Czechs because the Czechoslovak government was not invited to negotiations of the Munich Agreement at all and was only told of its results so it was received as dictate or ultimatum.
During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, most of the Czech resistance groups demanded, based on German Nazi terror during occupation, the "final solution of the German question" () which would have to be "solved" by deportation of the ethnic Germans from their homeland. The final agreement for the expulsion of the German population however was not reached until 2 August 1945 at the end of Potsdam Conference.
In the months following the end of the war the expulsion happened from May till August 1945. These expulsions were encouraged by hate-inciting speeches made by several Czechoslovak politicians. The expulsions were executed by order of local authorities mostly by groups of armed volunteers. However in some cases it was initiated or pursued by assistance of the regular army. Several thousand died violently during the expulsion and many more died from hunger and illness as a consequence. The expulsion according the Potsdam Conference proceeded from 25 January 1946 till October of that year. An estimated 1.6 million ethnic Germans were deported to the American zone of what would become West Germany. An estimated 800,000 were deported to the Soviet zone (in what would become East Germany).
Today, both countries share 815 km of common borders. The Czech Republic has an embassy in Berlin, 3 general consulates (in Bonn, Dresden and Munich), and 6 honorary consulates (in Dortmund, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Nürnberg, Rostock and Stuttgart). Germany has an embassy in Prague. Both countries are full members of NATO and of the European Union.

Frank Charles (speedway rider)

Frank Charles (born 10 March 1908 Barrow-in-Furness, England - died 15 July 1939) was a former international motorcycle speedway rider who won the Star Riders' Championship in 1935 and rode in the first ever World Championship final in 1936.
Career summary.
Prior to taking up speedway, Charles worked as a baker and grocer, and performed in music halls with a piano accordion. In 1929 Charles rode for Burnley, in 1930 for Manchester White City and then for Leeds Lions and Belle Vue in 1931 but was badly injured and lost his form, and so retired from the sport. In 1933, the Belle Vue Aces tempted him out of retirement, and looked to have regained his former form when he won the Wembley championship that year, also breaking the track record. In 1934 Charles' father died, so he returned to the family business. In 1935 Wembley Lions paid £1,000 to sign Charles, where he became the club's top scorer and was selected to ride for England against Australia. He went on to win the Star Riders' Championship despite only initially taking part in the competition as a replacement for Ginger Lees. In 1936 he topped the club's scoring again, was top scorer for the England Test team, and qualified for World Championship final, tying for fourth place with Cordy Milne, and broke the track record during the meeting. He qualified again for the 1937 final. At the end of the 1938 season he decided to retire to concentrate on his long-term hobby of gliding.
Death.
On 15 June 1939 he made a return to the Wembley Lions team. However, after being excused a test call up on 15 July 1939, Charles was killed whilst taking part in a national gliding competition.

Uvis Helmanis (born June 10, 1972 in Talsi, Latvian SSR, USSR) is a former Latvian professional basketball player who played power forward position. After retiring he became a coach, and is currently working as a head coach for BK Liepājas Lauvas.
Player profile.
Experienced and powerful, Helmanis has been a key player for the National Team since the nineties. Some coaches were trying to put this 2.04 m player under the basket but his style tends to draw him away from the hoop. Helmanis can use his big body in the paint, especially on defense, but his most effective weapon is his ability to knock down the three-point shot. He doesn’t look very quick, but he is adept at getting himself open from behind the three-point line. Helmanis has been a National Champion in three different countries in his career: Latvia, Poland and Germany. After four good years at Bamberg, Helmanis came back to Latvia and celebrated his homecoming with "eternal" national champs BK Ventspils and showed all his best assets in the Baltic league and in ULEB Cup games. He is not a vocal leader, but an irreplaceable member of the team. In the summer of 2009 Helmanis became the first Latvian to play in five EuroBaskets. 
After winning the Latvian Championship with Barons LMT in 2010 he retired as a player and became a head coach of the team. After unsuccessful results he was fired in midseason and went to Poland to work for the assistant of Dainius Adomaitis, head coach of Czarni Słupsk. After one season Uvis came back to Latvia and joined a coach room of BC VEF Rīga, becoming an assistant of head coach Ramunas Butautas. He became head coach of BK Liepājas Lauvas in 2013.

Festival Cruises (known as First European Cruises in North America) was a Greece-based cruise line that operated between 1994 and 2004. It was founded in 1992 by the Greek entrepreneur George Poulides using second-hand ships. The company acquired three new-built ships between 1999 and 2002, but was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2004.
History.
George Poulides founded Festival Cruises in 1992. The company begun operations in 1994 after purchasing from Chandris Cruises. The following year the company acquired MS "Starward" from Norwegian Cruise Line, renaming her . A third second-hand ship followed in 1997, when MS "Southern Cross" was acquired from Premier Cruise Line and renamed for service with Festival.
Festival Cruises acquired their first newbuilt ship in 1999, when was delivered from Chantiers de l'Atlantique in France. In 2000 Festival Cruises announced that the company would be merged into Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), with the Festival Cruises brand being maintained under P&O ownership. The merger plan was abandoned later that year due to low value of cruise line shares at the time. Two additional newbuilt ships based on an enlarged version of the "Mistral" design were delivered in 2001 and 2002 as and , respectively. Following delivery of the new ships the "Bolero" and "Flamenco" were chartered to other opeators. Festival Cruises had an option for two more ships of the enlarged "Mistral" design, but the company decided not to use the option. Two more "Mistral" class ships were however built for MSC Cruises as "MSC Lirica" and "MSC Opera".
Festival Cruises went bankrupt in early 2004, with all the company's ships were laid up and subsequently auctioned to other operators; "European Stars" and "European Vision" were sold to MSC Cruises, "Mistral" to a French investor group who chartered her to Iberojet, "The Azur" to Mano Maritime, "Bolero" to Orient Queen Shipping and "Flamenco" to Cruise Elysia.

<doc id="19507208" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19507208" title="Bradford Festival Choral Society">
Bradford Festival Choral Society

Bradford Festival Choral Society was founded as a direct result of the opening of St George’s Hall in 1853. A massed choir of over 200 singers from far and wide was formed for the first Bradford Musical Festival which took place that year. When the second festival took place in 1856 another choir, consisting of rather more locally based singers, was formed and at the end of the festival it was felt wasteful to disband a group which had already gained such a high reputation. A meeting was held on 17 November 1856 under the chairmanship of Samuel Smith, the original instigator of the construction of St George’s Hall, and Bradford Festival Choral Society came into being with Mr Smith as its first President. The conductor was William Jackson who had been the highly successful trainer of the chorus for both festivals. The choir sang and rehearsed at the Hall and soon gained the nickname of the “Coffee and Bun Society” as refreshments were provided for those members travelling from a distance. This arrangement was also intended to discourage possible visits to licensed premises before rehearsal!
The choir’s rise to fame was so rapid that it was summoned to sing before Queen Victoria in June 1858. It is hardly surprising that there was a sudden glut of applicants to join the Society and high standards could be demanded of singers. The group left Bradford by special train on 28 June 1858 and performed at Buckingham Palace for the large royal party that same evening. The concert was a huge success and the choir went on to sing twice at The Crystal Palace and also at St Martin’s Hall, as well as at the Handel Festival, during the rest of its week long stay in London. On its return to Bradford, the choir repeated its London programme in St George’s Hall and Peel Park before the end of what must have been its annus mirabilis.
The next festival featuring the choir took place in 1859 and was an artistic success but, as is so often the case, was not very rewarding in financial terms. As a result, the next festival was postponed and eventually cancelled. No more triennial festivals took place in Bradford.
Without festivals, the choir settled down to a regular routine of concerts in St George’s Hall, the equilibrium only shattered by the sudden and much lamented death of its conductor William Jackson in 1866. Such was the esteem in which he was held that the Society undertook all the funeral arrangements and was also responsible for the monument in Undercliffe Cemetery and also the one in Masham – Jackson’s birthplace. Performances of Jackson’s oratorio, The Deliverance of Israel from Babylon, were given to raise money for these projects.
Shortly after this, in 1870, the close association with St George’s Hall was relaxed and, although the Hall remained the venue for concerts, rehearsals moved to the Mechanics’ Institute, where they remained for the next 100 years until the building was demolished.
In 1906 the choir was eagerly planning, in spite of great financial problems, celebrations for its Golden Jubilee. Fortuitously, an invitation was received from the London Philharmonic Society to sing in the Queen’s Hall. The Chairman, Henry J Mason, generously offered to fund the trip and 323 singers left by special train, reputed to be (at 200 yards long) the longest train ever to leave Bradford. The concert, consisting of the double motet Sing ye to the Lord (Bach) and Beethoven’s Choral Symphony, was greeted with acclaim and the choir returned home at 4am, no doubt exhausted.
In Bradford, the choir enjoyed celebratory concerts and a grand ball in St George’s Hall. It was also during this jubilee year that it was presented with an original Schubert masterpiece by a former President, Mr W. M. Hertz. This manuscript was later almost forgotten until it was rediscovered by the librarian at the time of the centenary and subsequently deposited in the Bradford Archives. In 2005 it was deemed necessary to realise all possible assets in order to continue the work of the Society and the manuscript was sold.
The 20th century led to great changes. The Society survived two World Wars with attendant problems of a lack of male singers and of blackout restrictions. Sir Malcolm Sargent became the Society’s conductor in 1925 and was instrumental in raising the choir’s profile during the 26 years of his reign. During this time too, BFCS had to leave St George’s Hall when it became a cinema in 1926. A new home was found at Eastbrook Hall where the choir remained until the reopening of St George’s as a concert hall in 1953. It was a real landmark when BFCS took part in the concert, broadcast by the BBC, to celebrate the opening. In the same year, the choir had a great artistic triumph when it featured in the first live performance of Janáček’s Glagolitic Mass in Leeds Town Hall.
It was greatly appreciated that the centenary season could be held back in ‘the old home’ and celebratory concerts and a dinner were held. The Society was set fair for another 100 years.
This certainly seemed the case as Sir David Willcocks (or Mr Willcocks as he then was) took up the baton as the Society’s conductor. During the time of his appointment he had a real rapport with the choir and many were the successes over which he presided. Two performances of Britten’s War Requiem, in 1964 and 1967, are particularly remembered. It was greatly appreciated that when Sir David Willcocks had to relinquish his position 17 years later, he still returned for many years to preside over the annual Carol Concert.
Other eminent conductors have been Sir Charles Groves, who conducted a memorable performance of Delius’ A Mass of Life, Richard Hickox, David Lloyd Jones, Brian Kay and guest conductors such as John Rutter, Meredith Davies, Sir John Barbirolli and many others. Most of the great works in the choral repertoire have been performed and the choir has never flinched from singing contemporary works by Bliss, Julius Harrison, John Rutter, David Fanshawe and Peter Maxwell Davies to name but a few.
Recent years.
Today Bradford Festival Choral Society is Bradford's largest choir and one of the biggest in the North of England. With a current singing membership of around 100 voices the choir performs all the major works in the choral repertoire at St George's Concert Hall and other venues in the Bradford area. The choir enjoys a busy season of concerts including major programmes in November and early Spring, concerts in the summer and at Christmas as well as Bradford's traditional Christmas performance of Handel's Messiah.
Since 2008 the choir has been enjoying a revival under the baton of its young and dynamic Musical Director Thomas Leech, who has led the choir into new musical territory while constantly encouraging excellent performances of choral classics. Choir membership and audience attendance continues to grow as the society re-establishes itself amongst the leading choral societies in the north of England. Recent performances have included the opening concert of the revived Bradford Festival in July 2013, traditional choral works, collaborations with living composers (including Duncan Druce - Mozart Requiem completion - and Will Todd - Mass in Blue), community projects (several long-term 'Learn to Sing' courses) and of course the core choral repertoire.

Geoff Barton

Geoff Barton is a British journalist who founded the heavy metal magazine "Kerrang!" and was an editor of "Sounds" music magazine.
He joined "Sounds" at the age of nineteen after completing a journalism course at the London College of Printing. He specialised in covering rock music and helped popularise the New Wave of British Heavy Metal after using the term for the first time (after editor Alan Lewis coined it) in the May 1979 issue of "Sounds". In 1981 he edited the first issue of "Kerrang!", which was published as a one off. This was successful so it became a fortnightly magazine. He left the magazine in 1995.
Barton's articles for "Sounds" which covered the NWOBHM helped to create the sense that an actual movement was taking place, and in a sense helped to create one in the process. Barton recalls: "The phrase New Wave of British Heavy Metal was this slightly tongue-in-cheek thing...I didn't really feel that any of these bands were particularly linked in a musical way, but it was interesting that so many of them should then be emerging at more or less the same time." 
He currently works for "Classic Rock Magazine".

Robert Steinberg (chocolate maker)

Robert Wayne Steinberg (March 4, 1947 – September 17, 2008) was an American physician who co-founded Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker in 1996 with John Scharffenberger, his friend and former patient.
Early life.
Robert Steinberg was born on March 4, 1947, in Boston, Massachusetts, to parents Arthur and Selma Levinson Steinberg. His mother was an elementary school teacher while his father was a clinical psychologist. Steinberg's father died of Hodgkin's disease when he was a child.
Steinberg received his bachelor's degree in 1969 from Harvard University. He later earned his medical degree from the University of Connecticut in 1974. He first moved to San Francisco as part of a medical internship. He remained in the area and ran his own family practice for approximately twenty years in San Francisco and Ukiah, California.
Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker.
Steinberg was diagnosed in 1989 with lymphoma, a disease which he would battle for nearly twenty years. At the time, Steinberg was given a 50% chance of succumbing to the disease within ten years of his diagnosis. He realized that his full-time profession as a physician would be difficult with the necessary medical treatment. As a result of his diagnosis, Steinberg began exploring his own interests and alternative career paths.
A friend of Steinberg's introduced him to chocolate making and gave him a 600-page book on the "science of chocolate making". Steinberg, who was a self-proclaimed foodie, had been interested in food and cooking since he was a child. The concept of making chocolate caught Steinberg's attention. Following his diagnosis, Steinberg travelled to Lyon, France, in 1993, where he became an apprentice at a small family-owned chocolate maker called Bernachon for a few weeks. His new interest in chocolate would later take him to a number of cacao growing nations including Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela.
Steinberg returned from Lyons to California following the end of his Bernachon internship. He soon ran into his neighbor and former patient, John Scharffenberger. Scharffenberger was in the process of selling his winery, called Scharffenberger Cellars, at the time. Steinberg gave Scharffenberger a sample of the Bernachon French chocolates. The chocolate had been in Steinberg's pocket for a long time, but Scharffenberger declared it, "tasted better than anything I'd ever had." The two soon began talking about joining forces as partners.
Steinberg and Scharffenberger set up a test kitchen in Steinberg's home kitchen to experiment with approximately thirty different varieties of chocolate and their potential recipes. The tools they used in Steinberg's kitchen to develop the future Scharffen Berger brand chocolate included a mortar and pestle, a coffee grinder and a hair dryer, which they used to keep the chocolate's viscosity.
In 1996, Steinberg and Scharffenberger opened a small chocolate factory and factory store in southern San Francisco, where they produced their first chocolate products for sale in the marketplace. The employed several antique German chocolate machines to make their products in small batches The new small business was called Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, which took advantage of John Scharffenberger's name recognition in the San Francisco Bay Area. (Scharffenberger had previously been in the winemaker).
Scharffen Berger Chocolate hit the San Francisco Bay Area markets at a time when Americans were becoming interested in consuming higher quality, speciality foods such as wine, coffee and chocolate. Scharffen Berger chocolate bars, which were known for a bittersweet chocolate with intense fruity notes, quickly gained a following as their products became available in supermarkets and specialty stores in the Bay Area.
Consumer demand led Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker to relocate to a larger factory in 2001, complete with a cafe and gift shop, in Berkeley, California. The company also expanded its product portfolio from chocolate bars to include ganache, caramel, mints, hot cocoa and chocolate-dipped fruit.
Scharffen Berger was acquired by The Hershey Company. Hershey's began marketing and distributing Scharffen Berger Chocolate as its high end product line.
Death.
Robert Steinberg died on September 17, 2008, of lymphatic cancer at the age of 61. He was survived by his mother, Selma Levinson Steinberg, sister, Nancy Steinberg, and stepsister, Judith Margolin.

Koreans in Poland

Koreans in Poland do not form a very large population. They consist of both North and South Koreans.
Migration history.
Pre–World War II and communist era.
Poland's first Korean residents were believed to have come as staff members of the Japanese embassy in the 1930s, when Korea was a part of the Japanese Empire. One, a dentist named Yu Dong-ju, stayed behind in Poland after World War II and began teaching the Korean language to local East Asian studies students; however, he ceased teaching upon the arrival of officially-dispatched language teachers sent by the newly established North Korean government. North Korea also sent some students to Poland over the years; in May 1989, while Poland and South were still making overtures towards establishing full diplomatic relations with each other, two North Korean exchange students in Poland, Kim Un-hak and Tong Yŏng-jun, held a press conference to announce their defection to the South.
Post-communist era.
As of 2006, an estimated 75 North Koreans were employed at various Polish firms in the Baltic Sea coastal towns of Gdańsk, Gdynia, and Sopot, including some working as welders at the famous Gdańsk Shipyard where the Solidarity trade union was founded. The workers' salaries are paid to a holding company which is suspected to share the money with the North Korean government; they are accompanied by supervisors who speak fluent Polish but do not share in their work. They live in a dormitory in Olszynka and are taken directly to their job by bus; they have no contact with their neighbours. There were also some working for no pay on in Kleczanów on the farm of Stanislaw Dobek, the president of the Polish-Korean Friendship Association. When informed of the long hours the workers were required to put in, seven days a week, and the possibility that their salaries were directly funding the North Korean regime, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy vice-minister Kazimierz Kuberski claimed that there was nothing he could do. In June 2008, North Korea dispatched a further 42 labourers to cities in northwestern Poland to engage in construction work.
The community of South Koreans in Poland is not very large; between 1997 and 2005, their numbers fell by nearly four-tenths, from 825 to 516, before rebounding to 1,034 by 2009, according to the statistics of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. MOFAT statistics continued to record growth after that, showing 1,156 Koreans living in Poland in 2011, up by 11% from the 2009 survey. 52 were permanent residents, 248 were international students, and the remaining 856 had other types of visas. The LG Group and other South Korean electronics companies have established factories in Wrocław, and sent a number of Korean expatriate staff to live there. During the startup of these companies (in 2007) they had trouble finding local workers and considered to obtain permission to import guest workers from China.
Religion.
The South Korean government lists one Korean Buddhist congregation and three Korean Christian churches in Warsaw, as well as two Korean Christian churches in Wrocław. According to the Buddha Dharma Education Association, there are a total of twelve Korean Zen Buddhist temples throughout Poland.

Duryodhana asks Veda Vyasa for an explanation. He is then told that, since his mother, Gandhari had an astrological defect, she is first married of to a donkey and then married to his father. Duryodhana gains animosity towards the kingdom of Gandhara where the king, the father of his mother Gandhari, rules. He attacks Gandhara and lays waste of the whole kingdom.
He them imprisons the royal family in his prison. He gives them only one rice grain per prisoner. The king of Gandhara then stops everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided. He says that instead of everyone dying, they could keep at least one of their princes alive. He chooses Sakuni to be alive. Sakuni takes an oath that he will do everything he can to destroy the entire Kaurava clan. He makes magic dice from his father's spinal cord. The magic dice show exactly the number that he would want. Duryodhana takes pity on the lone prisoner, Sakuni after the rest of the Gandhara royal family dies in prison out of starvation. Sakuni joins the evil of coterie of Duryodhana, Karna and Dushyasana.
The wax house.
Sakuni schemes an evil plan to kill the Pandavas through trickery. He constructs a house made of wax in Varanasi. Pandavas are ordered to go on pilgrimage to Varanasi until the troubled affairs of the state are resolved. Krishna sees through the plan of the evil Sakuni. He warns Bheema to keep an eye on miscreants trying to burn the house. He later orders Bheema to dig an underground tunnel from the wax house into a forest nearby, which Bheema does. On a midnight, as Krishna predicted, the house is burned by fire on the orders of Duryodhana.
Hidimbi.
Bheema however carries his four brothers and mother on his back and races through the tunnel and takes them to the hiding spot. There a certain cannibal rakshasa named Hidimbasura lives with his sister Hidimbi. He smells the scent of human beings and orders his sister to bring them. Hidimbi however fall in love at first sight with Bheema. Unable to wait any longer, Hidimbasura comes to kill the humans himself. Bheema however kills him very easily. Hidimbi is married to Bheema.

The Pandavas live under the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very powerful monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.
Bheema sets of to the monster's place, but on the way he eats all the food. After a very ferocious fight with the monster, he does kill it in the end. Bheema emerges as the victor.

Jarasandha chooses Bheema as his sparring partner. During the fight, Krishna signals Bheema to tear Jarasandha vertically apart into two pieces so the latter will be killed for good. However the body parts of Jarasandha rejoin because of a boon he possesses, and he regains his life.

Château de Beauregard, La Celle-Saint-Cloud

Château de Beauregard is a former house in La Celle-Saint-Cloud south-west suburbs of Paris, five kilometres north of Versailles.
The name of the domain seems to have its roots in the Middle Ages. The château was built on a top of a hill between La Celle-Saint-Cloud and Le Chesnay.
In the early 17th century, the house was owned by the du Val family, Pierre du Val was the House master of king of France. Then the château was the property of the Montaigu family, which rented it. During the Revolution and Empire eras, ownership of the château changed often.
In the mid 19th century, Harriet Howard bought the house and its park. She also bought the Béchevet farm and the Bel-Ébat stud farm, marking a very large 184 ha property. The château was in a poor condition; she rebuilt it in a neo-classical style. She also enclosed the whole area with a wall. From this château, she worked for the success of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (later Napoleon III), of whom she was mistress and financial backer. She died in 1865.
Her son Martin-Constantin Haryett, created comte de Béchevet by Napoléon III, was a spendthrift, and had to sell the château in 1870 to the duchesse de Beauffremont.
But a few months later, the Franco-Prussian War broke out.
The Prussians, installed in La Celle Saint-Cloud made Beauregard their headquarters, and built some fortifications.
The duchesse de Beauffremont was ruined, was not able to rehabilite it, and the house was seized.
In 1872, it then became the property of baron Maurice de Hirsch, who fully restored it.
Although having a town house in rue de l'Élysée in Paris, he and his family frequently stayed at Beauregard.
At his death in 1896, the château was bequeathed to Maurice Arnold Deforest, comte de Bendern (Liechtenstein title).
He owned several properties across Europe, and did not come so often to Beauregard, leaving the château abandoned.
In 1939, there was a plan to install an auxiliary hospital, but the poor condition of the château did not allow it.
It then became a military depot and was bombed in 1940.
During the Occupation, the organisation Todt used it as a base, and then it became an annex of the Fresnes prison and a Russian prison camp.
After the war, Beauregard was in ruins.
Its owner, the comte de Bendern, thought to transform it into a forest reserve open to the public, but he was not able to do it, and eventually gave it to the city of Paris in 1949 for social housing.
In 1956, the château ruins were cleared. Only the front-core (front door) still stands (but very deteriorated), surrounded by a group of buildings built in the late 1960s in the so-called Beauregard neighborhood, 300 metres north of the A13 motorway.
