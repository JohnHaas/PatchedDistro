Karakuri Dôji Ultimo

The pilot chapter was originally published in a special issue of "Jump Square", called "Jump SQ. II (Second)", on April 18, 2008. The series "Ultimo" was first serialized in "Jump Square" in March 2009, and it continues monthly serialization. Shueisha also publishes "Ultimo" in "tankōbon" format—the first published on July 3, 2009, and the fifth on November 4, 2010.
Viz Media later licensed the manga for an English language adaptation in North America and published "Chapter: 0" in the September 2008 issue of "Shonen Jump". In promotion of the English adaptation, a press conference was held at the 2008 New York Comic Con with promotional artwork. The series "Ultimo" was serialized monthly in "Shonen Jump", beginning in the July 2009 issue and ending serialization in the February 2011 issue. It is now published directly into volumes, each containing multiple chapters of the series. Starting from volume 7, Ultimo was changed to Shonen Jump Advanced while it was marked as just Shonen Jump in volumes 1-6.
Plot.
Pilot chapter.
Ultimo and Vice were created in feudal Japan to be "perfect good" and "perfect evil" as Dr. Dunstan's "last curse upon this world." A thousand years later, a monster wearing a Noh mask wreaks havoc in Farmless City of West Tokyo, while the S.K.A.T. Police unit cannot stop it. Ultimo plunges in to destroy the monster, explaining that the creature is about to show its true form, Vice, Ultimo's evil counterpart. The mechanical boys end their fight both badly damaged, and the movement of select groups around Japan begins.
Serialization.
Yamato Agari is a 21st-century reincarnation of a bandit from the Heian period. As in the past, Yamato meets the "Karakuri Dôji," mechanical boys, that transform his otherwise normal life into a battle of good versus evil. Immediately after Yamato meets the dôji Ultimo, another one called Vice appears, and he barely escapes from their fight. Now acquainted with Ultimo, Yamato is confronted by many other dôji, both evil and good.
Yamato's fights become increasingly dangerous as the fifteen prominent dôji meet on the day of the "Hundred Machine Funeral," the last day of the world as we know it. With imminent destruction at hand, Yamato uses Ultimo's ability to bring the world back to the day he first meets the dôji. In order to avoid the catastrophe from repeating itself, Yamato plans to learn for himself the meanings of "good and evil" by meeting each of the dôji himself.
Dunstan later reveals that the Hundred Machine Funeral isn't a fight to the death, which most of the doji believed; they are instead supposed to try winning a Good/Evil doji over to their side within a time limit. The side that has the most doji on it at the end of the time limit is the winner. Observing the contest for Dunstan is his own daughter.
Production.
"Karakuri Dôji Ultimo" was first announced as an unnamed work between Stan Lee, the co-creator of iconic superhero titles such as "Spider-Man" and "X-Men", and Hiroyuki Takei, the creator of "Shaman King". According to Stan Lee in an audio interview, he was called by Dream Ranch and JEA who said that they wanted him to create a manga with them, and that it was to be published by Shueisha. Stan Lee stated that he has never made a comic about two robots of the same level of power, with one not being as heroic as the other. In conceptualizing "Ultimo", Stan Lee wanted to create something that both Japanese and American readers would enjoy. The first fully colorized picture of Vice and Ultimo was released on the "Jump Square" website on April 4, 2008. The pilot chapter was finally finished and published in "Jump SQ. II".
On the same day as the release, Viz hosted a press event in the "Shonen Jump" panel, attended by Stan Lee, Takanori Asada ("Jump Square" editor), and Marc Weidenbaum ("Shonen Jump" editor-in-chief) at the 2008 New York Comic Con. Two promotional art pieces by Hiroyuki Takei were created, one with Ultimo and the other with Dr. Dunstan both including the manga's logo. "I'm so happy that we can work with such a great creator as Stan Lee. I am so happy that two great actors are working together, and I know that "Ultimo" will be a great work," said Takanori Asada at the press event.
Manga.
The 32-page pilot chapter "Karakuri Dôji Ultimo Chapter: 0" premiered in the first issue of "Jump SQ. II (Second)" on April 18, 2008, with the first three pages in full color. The first three pages were earlier revealed as part of a preview for "Jump SQ. II" on Shueisha's S-Manga.Net. "Chapter: 0" was later adapted into English by Viz Media, and published in the September 2008 issue of their "Shonen Jump" manga anthology, which went on sale on August 5, 2008.
The main series "Karakuri Dôji Ultimo" continues publication in the main "Jump Square" anthology, beginning serialization in its March 2009 issue. Viz Media has licensed the series for North American distribution in "Shonen Jump", and has been serialized since its July 2009 issue.
Characters.
The major characters in "Ultimo" possess their own Karakuri Dôji, humanoid dolls each based on the Six Perfections or Seven Deadly Sins, good or evil respectively.
Reception.
The English adaptation of the "Karakuri Dôji Ultimo" pilot chapter was reviewed by Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin. "This prologue of "Ultimo" doesn’t really offer enough to evaluate it, except to say that the dialogue and exposition are awkward and clunky enough to seem like the work of an amateur rather than a seasoned veteran" said Leroy Douresseaux. Leroy referred to "Ultimo" as a blend of mecha manga, "Dragon Ball", and "Green Lantern". "I’m too intrigued to be disappointed by what I read. Stan Lee’s best work was created when he riffed off unique and powerfully imaginative creators (Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko), so I’m curious to see what this combo of Lee and a manga-ka like Takei can do."

Caspian Sea

The Caspian Sea (, , , , ) is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. The sea has a surface area of (not including Garabogazköl Aylagy) and a volume of . It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) and is bounded to the northwest by Russia, to the west by Azerbaijan, to the south by Iran, to the southeast by Turkmenistan, and to the northeast by Kazakhstan.
The ancient inhabitants of its coast perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean, probably because of its saltiness and seeming boundlessness. It has a salinity of approximately 1.2%, about a third the salinity of most seawater.
Etymology.
The word Caspian is derived from the name of the Caspi (), ancient people who lived to the south-west of the sea in Transcaucasia. Strabo wrote that "to the country of the Albanians belongs also the territory called Caspiane, which was named after the Caspian tribe, as was also the sea; but the tribe has now disappeared". Moreover, the Caspian Gates, which is the name of a region in Tehran province of Iran, is another possible piece of evidence that they migrated to the south of the sea. The Iranian city Qazvin shares the root of its name with that of the sea. In fact, the traditional Arabic name for the sea itself is, Bahr al-Qazwin (Sea of Qazvin).
In classical antiquity among Greeks and Persians it was called the "Hyrcanian Ocean". In Persian antiquity, as well as in modern Iran, it is known as the "Mazandaran Sea" (). In Iran, it is also referred as Daryā-i Xazar sometimes. Among Indians it was called "Kashyap Sagar". In Turkic-speaking countries it is known as the "Khazar Sea". Old Russian sources call it the Khvalyn or Khvalis Sea (Хвалынское море / Хвалисское море) after the name of Khwarezmia. Ancient Arabic sources refer to it as "Baḥr Gīlān" (بحر جیلان) meaning "the Gilan Sea".
Turkic languages use a consistent nomenclature that is different from the Indo-European languages above. For instance, in Turkmen, the name is "Hazar deňizi", in Azeri, it is "Xəzər dənizi", and in modern Turkish, it is "Hazar denizi". In all these cases, the second word simply means "sea", and the first word refers to the historical Khazars who had a large empire based to the north of the Caspian Sea between the 7th and 10th centuries.
Physical characteristics.
Formation.
The Caspian Sea, like the Aral Sea and Black Sea, is a remnant of the ancient Paratethys Sea. It became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to tectonic uplift and a fall in sea level. During warm and dry climatic periods, the landlocked sea has all but dried up, depositing evaporitic sediments like halite that have become covered by wind-blown deposits and were sealed off as an evaporite sink when cool, wet climates refilled the basin. Due to the current inflow of fresh water, the Caspian Sea is a freshwater lake in its northern portions. It is more saline on the Iranian shore, where the catchment basin contributes little flow. Currently, the mean salinity of the Caspian is one third that of the Earth's oceans. The Garabogazköl embayment, which dried up when water flow from the main body of the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored, routinely exceeds oceanic salinity by a factor of 10.
Geography.
The Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water in the world and accounts for 40 to 44% of the total lacustrine waters of the world. The coastlines of the Caspian are shared by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. The Caspian is divided into three distinct physical regions: the Northern, Middle, and Southern Caspian. The Northern–Middle boundary is the Mangyshlak Threshold, which runs through Chechen Island and Cape Tiub-Karagan. The Middle–Southern boundary is the Apsheron Threshold, a sill of tectonic origin between the Eurasian continent and an oceanic remnant, that runs through Zhiloi Island and Cape Kuuli. The Garabogazköl Bay is the saline eastern inlet of the Caspian, which is part of Turkmenistan and at times has been a lake in its own right due to the isthmus which cuts it off from the Caspian.
Divisions between the three regions are dramatic. The Northern Caspian only includes the Caspian shelf, and is very shallow; it accounts for less than 1% of the total water volume with an average depth of only . The sea noticeably drops off towards the Middle Caspian, where the average depth is . The Southern Caspian is the deepest, with oceanic depths of over . The Middle and Southern Caspian account for 33% and 66% of the total water volume, respectively. The northern portion of the Caspian Sea typically freezes in the winter, and in the coldest winters ice forms in the south as well.
Over 130 rivers provide inflow to the Caspian, with the Volga River being the largest. A second affluent, the Ural River, flows in from the north, and the Kura River flows into the sea from the west. In the past, the Amu Darya (Oxus) of Central Asia in the east often changed course to empty into the Caspian through a now-desiccated riverbed called the Uzboy River, as did the Syr Darya farther north. The Caspian also has several small islands; they are primarily located in the north and have a collective land area of roughly . Adjacent to the North Caspian is the Caspian Depression, a low-lying region below sea level. The Central Asian steppes stretch across the northeast coast, while the Caucasus mountains hug the western shore. The biomes to both the north and east are characterized by cold, continental deserts. Conversely, the climate to the southwest and south are generally warm with uneven elevation due to a mix of highlands and mountain ranges; the drastic changes in climate alongside the Caspian have led to a great deal of biodiversity in the region.
The Caspian Sea has numerous islands throughout, all of them near the coasts. There are none in the deeper parts of the sea. Ogurja Ada is the largest island. The island is long, with gazelles roaming freely on it. In the North Caspian, the majority of the islands are small and uninhabited, like the Tyuleniy Archipelago, an Important Bird Area (IBA), although some of them have human settlements.
Hydrology.
The Caspian has characteristics common to both seas and lakes. It is often listed as the world's largest lake, although it is not a freshwater lake. It contains about 3.5 times more water, by volume, than all five of North America's Great Lakes combined. The Caspian was once part of the Tethys Ocean but became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to plate tectonics. The Volga River (about 80% of the inflow) and the Ural River discharge into the Caspian Sea, but it has no natural outflow other than by evaporation. Thus the Caspian ecosystem is a closed basin, with its own sea level history that is independent of the eustatic level of the world's oceans. The level of the Caspian has fallen and risen, often rapidly, many times over the centuries. Some Russian historians claim that a medieval rising of the Caspian, perhaps caused by the Amu Darya changing its inflow to the Caspian from the 13th century to the 16th century, caused the coastal towns of Khazaria, such as Atil, to flood. In 2004, the water level was 28 m (92 ft) below sea level.
Over the centuries, Caspian Sea levels have changed in synchrony with the estimated discharge of the Volga, which in turn depends on rainfall levels in its vast catchment basin. Precipitation is related to variations in the amount of North Atlantic depressions that reach the interior, and they in turn are affected by cycles of the North Atlantic Oscillation. Thus levels in the Caspian Sea relate to atmospheric conditions in the North Atlantic thousands of miles to the northwest. These factors make the Caspian Sea a valuable place to study the causes and effects of global climate change. 
The last short-term sea-level cycle started with a sea-level fall of from 1929 to 1977, followed by a rise of from 1977 until 1995. Since then smaller oscillations have taken place.
Environmental degradation.
The Volga River, the largest in Europe, drains 20% of the European land area and is the source of 80% of the Caspian’s freshwater inflow. Its lower reaches are heavily developed with numerous unregulated releases of chemical and biological pollutants. Although existing data are sparse and of questionable quality, there is ample evidence to suggest that the Volga is one of the principal sources of transboundary contaminants into the Caspian. The magnitude of fossil fuel extraction and transport activity constitute risks to water quality. Underwater oil and gas pipelines have been constructed or proposed, increasing potential environmental threats.
Various islands in the Caspian have suffered extensive environmental damage due to oil production. Vulf, Azerbaijan has been affected by ecological damage because of the petrochemical industry. This has significantly decreased species of marine birds in the area.
Nature.
Fauna.
Sturgeon inhabit the Caspian Sea in great numbers, and yield roe (eggs) that are processed into caviar. Overfishing has depleted a number of the historic fisheries including the economic exhaustion of the tuna fishery. In recent years overfishing has threatened the sturgeon population to the point that environmentalists advocate banning sturgeon fishing completely until the population recovers. However, the high price of sturgeon caviar allows fisherman to afford bribes to ensure the authorities look the other way, making regulations in many locations ineffective. Caviar harvesting further endangers the fish stocks, since it targets reproductive females.
The zebra mussel and the common carp are native to the Caspian and Black Seas, but have become invasive species elsewhere, when introduced.
The area has given its name to several species, including the Caspian gull and the Caspian tern. The Caspian seal ("Pusa caspica") is endemic to the Caspian Sea, and is one of very few seal species that live in inland waters. There are several species and subspecies of fish endemic to the Caspian Sea, including the kutum (also known as the Caspian white fish), Caspian marine shad, Caspian roach, Caspian bream (some report that the bream occurring in the Aral Sea is the same subspecies), and a Caspian "salmon" (a subspecies of trout, "Salmo trutta caspiensis"), which is critically endangered.
Flora.
Many rare and endemic plant species of Russia are associated with the tidal areas of the Volga delta and riparian forests of the Samur River delta. The shoreline is also a unique refuge for plants adapted to the loose sands of the Central Asian Deserts. The principal limiting factors to successful establishment of plant species are hydrological imbalances within the surrounding deltas, water pollution, and various land reclamation activities. The water level change within the Caspian Sea is an indirect reason for which plants may not get established. This affects aquatic plants of the Volga delta, such as "Aldrovanda vesiculosa" and the native "Nelumbo caspica". About 11 plant species are found in the Samur River delta, including the unique liana forests that date back to the Tertiary period.
With an increase in the level of the Caspian Sea between 1994–96, there has been a large reduction in the number of habitats for rare species of aquatic vegetation. This has been attributed to a general lack of seeding material in newly formed coastal lagoons and water bodies.
History.
The earliest hominid remains found around the Caspian Sea are from Dmanisi dating back to around 1.8 Ma and yielded a number of skeletal remains of Homo erectus or Homo ergaster. More later evidence for human occupation of the region come from a number of caves in Georgia and Azerbaijan such as Kudaro and Azykh Caves. There is evidence for Lower Palaeolithic human occupation south of the Caspian from western Alburz. These are Ganj Par and Darband Cave sites. Neanderthal remains also have been discovered at a cave site in Georgia. Discoveries in the Huto cave and the adjacent Kamarband cave, near the town of Behshahr, Mazandaran south of the Caspian in Iran, suggest human habitation of the area as early as 11,000 years ago.
The Caspian area is rich in energy resources. Wells were being dug in the region as early as the 10th century. By the 16th century, Europeans were aware of the rich oil and gas deposits around the area. English traders Thomas Bannister and Jeffrey Duckett described the area around Baku as “a strange thing to behold, for there issueth out of the ground a marvelous quantity of oil, which serveth all the country to burn in their houses. This oil is black and is called nefte. There is also by the town of Baku, another kind of oil which is white and very precious (i.e., petroleum)."
In 1950, the construction of Main Turkmen Canal was started under the orders of Joseph Stalin. The waterway, which would be used for shipping, not irrigation, was to run from Nukus on the Amu-Darya to Krasnovodsk on the Caspian Sea thus connecting the Amu-Darya and the Aral Sea to the Caspian. However the project was abandoned soon after the death of Stalin. The project was dropped in favor of the Qaraqum Canal, which runs on a more southerly route but does not reach the Caspian.
Oil extraction.
The world’s first offshore wells and machine-drilled wells were made in Bibi-Heybat Bay, near Baku, Azerbaijan. In 1873, exploration and development of oil began in some of the largest fields known to exist in the world at that time on the Absheron peninsula near the villages of Balakhanli, Sabunchi, Ramana and Bibi Heybat. Total recoverable reserves were more than 500 million tons. By 1900, Baku had more than 3,000 oil wells, 2,000 of which were producing at industrial levels. By the end of the 19th century, Baku became known as the "black gold capital", and many skilled workers and specialists flocked to the city.
By the turn of the 20th century, Baku was the center of international oil industry. In 1920, when the Bolsheviks captured Azerbaijan, all private property – including oil wells and factories – was confiscated. Afterwards, the republic's entire oil industry came under the control of the Soviet Union. By 1941, Azerbaijan was producing a record 23.5 million tons of oil, and the Baku region supplied nearly 72% of all oil extracted in the entire USSR.
In 1994, the "Contract of the Century" was signed, signaling the start of major international development of the Baku oil fields. The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, a major pipeline allowing Azerbaijan oil to flow straight to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, opened in 2006.
Political issues.
Many of the islands along the Azerbaijani coast continue to hold significant geopolitical and economic importance because of the potential oil reserves found nearby. Bulla Island, Pirallahı Island, and Nargin - which was used as a former Soviet base and is the largest island in the Baku bay, all hold oil reserves. Ashuradeh is situated on the easternmost end of Miankaleh peninsula to the north east of Gorgan Bay, near the Iranian coast. It was separated from the peninsula after islanders created a channel.
The oil in the Caspian basin is estimated to be worth over US $12 trillion. The collapse of the USSR and subsequent opening of the region has led to an intense investment and development scramble by international oil companies. In 1998 Dick Cheney commented that "I can't think of a time when we've had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian."
A key problem to further development in the region is the status of the Caspian Sea and the establishment of the water boundaries among the five littoral states (see below). The current disputes along Azerbaijan's maritime borders with Turkmenistan and Iran could potentially affect future development plans.
Much controversy currently exists over the proposed Trans-Caspian oil and gas pipelines. These projects would allow western markets easier access to Kazakh oil, and potentially Uzbek and Turkmen gas as well. The United States has given its support for the pipelines. Russia officially opposes the project on environmental grounds. Analysts note that the pipelines would bypass Russia completely, thereby denying the country valuable transit fees, as well as destroying its current monopoly on westward-bound hydrocarbon exports from the region. Recently both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have expressed their support for the Trans-Caspian Pipeline.
US diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks revealed that BP covered up a gas leak and blowout incident in September 2008 at an operating gas field in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshi area of the Azerbaijan Caspian Sea.
International disputes.
Negotiations related to the demarcation of the Caspian Sea have been going on for nearly a decade among the states bordering the Caspian – Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran.
The status of the Caspian Sea is the key problem. There are three major considerations affected by the Caspian Sea status: access to mineral resources (oil and natural gas), access for fishing and access to international waters (through Russia's Volga river and the canals connecting it to the Black Sea and Baltic Sea). Access to the Volga River is particularly important for the landlocked states of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. This matter is of course sensitive to Russia, because this potential traffic will move through its territory (albeit onto the inland waterways). If a body of water is labeled as sea then there would be some precedents and international treaties obliging the granting of access permits to foreign vessels. If a body of water is labeled merely as lake then there are no such obligations. Environmental issues are also somewhat connected to the status and borders issue.
It should be mentioned that Russia got the bulk of the former Soviet Caspian military fleet (and also currently has the most powerful military presence in the Caspian Sea). Some assets were assigned to Azerbaijan. Kazakhstan and especially Turkmenistan got a very small share because they lack major port cities.
According to a treaty signed between Iran (Persia) and the Soviet Union, the Caspian Sea is technically a lake and it is to be divided into two sectors (Persian and Soviet), but the resources (then mainly fish) would be commonly shared. The line between the two sectors was to be seen as an international border in a common lake, like Lake Albert. Also the Soviet sector was sub-divided into administrative sectors of the four littoral republics.
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, not all of the newly independent states assumed continuation of the old treaty. At first Russia and Iran announced that they would continue to adhere to the old treaty.
After the old Soviet Union split into fifteen nations, including Caspian Sea neighbors Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, Iran has called for an equal division of the Caspian Sea among the five countries: Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. If this division does not come to pass, then Iran intends to recognize only its old treaty (between Iran and Russia) and will challenge Russia to divide its 50% share among the three littoral states – Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan – over a more friendly position toward the West and the U.S., such as opening of U.S. interest section in Tehran.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan announced that they do not consider themselves parties to this treaty.
Later followed some proposals for common agreement between all littoral states about the status of the sea:
Current situation.
Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have agreed to a solution about their sectors. There are no problems between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, but the latter is not actively participating, so there is no agreement either. Azerbaijan is at odds with Iran over some oil fields that both states claim. There have been occasions where Iranian patrol boats have opened fire at vessels sent by Azerbaijan for exploration into the disputed region. There are similar tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (the latter claims that the former has pumped more oil than agreed from a field, recognized by both parties as shared). Less acute are the issues between Turkmenistan and Iran. Regardless, the southern part of the sea remains disputed.
After Russia adopted the median line sectoral division and the three treaties already signed between some littoral states this is looking like the realistic method for regulating the Caspian borders. The Russian sector is fully defined. The Kazakhstan sector is not fully defined, but is not disputed either. Azerbaijan's, Turkmenistan's and Iran's sectors are not fully defined. It is not clear if the issue of Volga-access to vessels from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan is covered by their agreements with Russia and also what the conditions are for Volga-access for vessels from Turkmenistan and Iran. 
The Caspian littoral states' meeting in 2007 signed an agreement that bars any ship not flying the national flag of a littoral state from entering the sea.
Cross-border inflow.
UNECE recognizes several rivers that cross international borders which flow into the Caspian Sea.
These are:
Transport.
Although the Caspian Sea is endorheic, its main tributary, the Volga, is connected by important shipping canals with the Don River (and thus the Black Sea) and with the Baltic Sea, with branch canals to Northern Dvina and to the White Sea.
Another Caspian tributary, the Kuma River, is connected by an irrigation canal with the Don basin as well.
Several scheduled ferry services (including train ferries) operate on the Caspian Sea, including:
The ferries are mostly used for cargo, only the Baku – Aktau and Baku – Türkmenbaşy routes accept passengers.
Canals.
The proposed Pechora-Kama Canal was a project that was widely discussed between the 1930s and 1980s. Shipping was a secondary consideration; its main goal was to redirect some of the water of the Pechora River (which flows into the Arctic Ocean) via the Kama into the Volga. The goals were both irrigation and stabilizing the water level in the Caspian, which was thought to be falling dangerously fast at the time. In 1971 some construction experiments were conducted using nuclear explosions.
In June 2007, in order to boost his oil-rich country's access to markets, Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbaev proposed a link between the Caspian and Black seas. It is hoped that the "Eurasia Canal" (Manych Ship Canal) would transform the landlocked Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries into maritime states, enabling them to significantly increase trade volume. While the canal would traverse Russian territory, it would benefit Kazakhstan through its Caspian Sea ports.
The most likely route for the canal, the officials at the Committee on Water Resources at Kazakhstan's Agriculture Ministry say, would follow the Kuma-Manych Depression, where currently a chain of rivers and lakes is already connected by an irrigation canal (Kuma-Manych Canal). Upgrading the Volga–Don Canal would be another option.

Organism

In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system (such as animal, fungus, micro-organism, or plant). In at least some form, all types of organisms are capable of responding to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development, and maintenance of homeostasis as a stable whole.
An organism may be either unicellular (a single cell) or, as in the case of humans, comprise many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. The term "multicellular" (many cells) describes any organism made up of more than one cell. An organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote.
Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains, the Bacteria and Archaea.
Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.
In 2002 Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed a clade, Neomura, which groups together the Archaea and Eukarya. Neomura is thought to have evolved from Bacteria, more specifically from Actinobacteria. See the article: Branching order of bacterial phyla (Cavalier-Smith, 2002).
Etymology.
The term "organism" (from Greek ὀργανισμός, "organismos", from ὄργανον, "organon", i.e. "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension") first appeared in the English language in 1703 and took on its current definition by 1834 (Oxford English Dictionary). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings.
There has been a great deal of recent controversy about the best way to define the organism and indeed about whether or not such a definition is necessary. Several contributions are responses to the suggestion that the category of "organism" may well not be adequate in biology.
Semantics.
The word "organism" may broadly be defined as an assembly of molecules functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the properties of life. However, many sources propose definitions that exclude viruses and theoretically possible man-made non-organic life forms. Viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction.
Chambers Online Reference provides a broad definition: "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction".
In multicellular terms, "organism" usually describes the whole hierarchical assemblage of systems (for example circulatory, digestive, or reproductive) themselves collections of organs; these are, in turn, collections of tissues, which are themselves made of cells. In some plants and the nematode "Caenorhabditis elegans", individual cells are totipotent.
A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit.
Non-cellular life.
Viruses are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous reproduction, growth or metabolism. This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but not of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own and cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds that form them. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction and they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the host cell. In this sense they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not accounted organisms, they do have their own genes and they do evolve by similar mechanisms by which organisms evolve.
The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of evolution could be different; however, the ability to evolve would not be affected. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate themselves. 
The discovery of viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong on the tree of life. The presence of these genes suggested that viruses could metabolize in the past. It was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have cellular origin. Most likely, they were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral hosts.
Organizational terminology.
All organisms are classified by the science of alpha taxonomy into either taxa or clades.
Taxa are ranked groups of organisms, which run from the general (domain) to the specific (species). A broad scheme of ranks in hierarchical order is:
To give an example, "Homo sapiens" is the Latin binomial equating to modern humans. All members of the species "sapiens" are, at least in theory, genetically able to interbreed. Several species may belong to a genus, but the members of different species within a genus are usually unable to interbreed to produce fertile offspring. (The red wolf "Canis lupus rufus", however, may be a result of interbreeding between the grey wolf "Canis lupus" and the coyote "Canis latrans".) Homo only has one surviving species ("sapiens"), "Homo erectus", "Homo neanderthalensis", etc. having become extinct thousands of years ago; some scientists argue for interbreeding between "H. sapiens" and "H. neanderthalensis" with fertile progeny. Several genera belong to the same family and so on up the hierarchy. Eventually, the relevant kingdom (Animalia, in the case of humans) is placed into one of the three domains depending upon certain genetic and structural characteristics.
All living organisms known to science are given classification by this system such that the species within a particular family are more closely related and genetically similar than the species within a particular phylum.
Since viruses are not living organisms, their classification is a challenging task. At first, viruses were classified according to their hosts: plant viruses, animal viruses, bacteriophages. Later, they were classified by the disease that they cause. For example, respiratory viruses, enterics. Now, viruses are classified based on the nucleic acid content, capsid symmetry and the presence or absence of the envelope.
Chemistry.
Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern the chemical processes of life. It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their DNA-based genes.
Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of chemical compounds that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles.
Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. Autotrophs produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while heterotrophs take in organic compounds from the environment.
The primary chemical element in these compounds is carbon. The chemical properties of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as carbon dioxide), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data (nucleic acids), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein).
Macromolecules.
Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into macromolecules and other smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of nucleotides. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into codons, each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular amino acid. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, folds in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.
These protein functions have been recognized:
A bilayer of phospholipids makes up the membrane of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell.Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membraine only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins.In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms.
Structure.
All organisms consist of monomeric units called cells; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a tissue, and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely epithelium, nervous tissue, muscle tissue, and connective tissue. Several types of tissue work together in the form of an organ to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the heart, or as a barrier to the environment as the skin). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an organ system to allow for reproduction, digestion, etc. Many multicellular organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life.
Cell.
The cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Schleiden and Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; all vital functions of an organism occur within cells, and cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.
There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane so DNA is unbound within the cell; eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes.
All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane, which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the electric potential of the cell. Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of genes, and RNA, containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells.
All cells share several similar characteristics of:
Life span.
One of the basic parameters of an organism is its life span. Some organisms live as short as one day, while some plants and fungi can live thousands of years.
Evolution.
Last universal ancestor.
The last universal ancestor is the most recent organism from which all organisms now living on Earth descend. Thus it is the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all current life on Earth. The LUA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago (sometime in the Paleoarchean era). The earliest evidences for life on Earth are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.
Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including geology and planetary science. These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of time.
All organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly.
Today, there is strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have a common ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins. All organisms use the same genetic code (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to translate nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection of many of these traits seems arbitrary.
In 2000, W. Ford Doolittle discussed variability in the genetic code (see: genetic code variation) and suggested that horizontal gene transfer might make it difficult to study the last universal ancestor. In 2010, a formal mathematical test calculated from the genetic record (and in particular the universal use of the same genetic code, same nucleotides, and same amino acids), that the factor in favor of a common ancestor's existence is 10^2489.
Sex.
Sexual reproduction (Sex) is widespread among current eukaryotes, and evidence suggests that it is a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. Dacks and Rogers proposed, on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis, that sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. The finding of a core set of genes necessary for meiosis in the descendants of lineages that diverged early form the eukaryotic evolutionary tree also led Ramesh et al. and Malik et al. to suggest that sex was present in a common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Furthermore, this view is supported by evidence that eukaryotes previously regarded as “ancient asexuals”, such as amoeba, were likely sexual in the past, and that most present day asexual amoeboid lineages likely arose recently and independently.
In prokaryotes, natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by recombination. Natural bacterial transformation is considered to be a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence, because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of natural competence to perform this complex process. Transformation is a common mode of DNA transfer, and over 60 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for transformation. Transformation in prokaryotes has basic similarities to sex in eukaryotes, and it has been proposed that eukaryotic sex evolved from prokaryotic sex.
History of life.
The chemical evolution from self-catalytic chemical reactions to life (see Origin of life) is not a part of biological evolution, but it is unclear at which point such increasingly complex sets of reactions became what we would consider, today, to be living organisms.
Little is known about the earliest developments in life. However, all existing organisms share certain traits, including cellular structure and genetic code. Most scientists interpret this to mean all existing organisms share a common ancestor, which had already developed the most fundamental cellular processes, but there is no scientific consensus on the relationship of the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota) or the origin of life. Attempts to shed light on the earliest history of life generally focus on the behavior of macromolecules, particularly RNA, and the behavior of complex systems.
The emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis (around 3 billion years ago) and the subsequent emergence of an oxygen-rich, non-reducing atmosphere can be traced through the formation of banded iron deposits, and later red beds of iron oxides. This was a necessary prerequisite for the development of aerobic cellular respiration, believed to have emerged around 2 billion years ago.
In the last billion years, simple multicellular plants and animals began to appear in the oceans. Soon after the emergence of the first animals, the Cambrian explosion (a period of unrivaled and remarkable, but brief, organismal diversity documented in the fossils found at the Burgess Shale) saw the creation of all the major body plans, or phyla, of modern animals. This event is now believed to have been triggered by the development of the Hox genes. About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonized the land, and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals, leading to the development of today's land ecosystems.
The evolutionary process may be exceedingly slow. Fossil evidence indicates that the diversity and complexity of modern life has developed over much of the history of the earth. Geological evidence indicates that the Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old. Studies on guppies by David Reznick at the University of California, Riverside, however, have shown that the rate of evolution through natural selection can proceed 10 thousand to 10 million times faster than what is indicated in the fossil record. Such comparative studies however are invariably biased by disparities in the time scales over which evolutionary change is measured in the laboratory, field experiments, and the fossil record.
Horizontal gene transfer.
The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence.
Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.
Biologist Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes."
Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms).
In modern terms, the category of organism cloning refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. However, the techniques used in cloning have the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Organism cloning is the subject of much ethical debate. (see Bioethics, Ethics of cloning, and Designer baby articles)
In 2008 the J. Craig Venter Institute assembled a synthetic bacterial genome, "Mycoplasma genitalium", by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. "The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments." Other companies, such as Synthetic Genomics, have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

Jens Landmark

Jens Landmark (17 December 1811 – 9 July 1880) was a Norwegian military officer and politician. He reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, was the director of Kongsberg Weapons Factory from 1854 to 1880, invented the Landmark conversion and served both as mayor as well as three periods in the Norwegian Parliament.
Personal life.
He was born in Ulfsten to Andreas Landmark and Jacobine Caroline Wind. His uncle was Nils Landmark, and he had several notable cousins, including Johan Theodor and Johan Widing Heiberg Landmark.
He married Richarda Mathea Petrie Bruenech (1813–1854), who hailed from Kongsberg.
Career.
Jens Landmark first made a career in the Norwegian Army. He rose in the hierarchy, from Cadet in 1827 to Second Lieutenant in 1831. He later became Captain. However, from 1838 he had a parallel career at the weapons factory Kongsberg Vaabenfabrik, a forerunner of Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace. Originally going into apprenticeship as a surveyor, he got this job on a permanent basis in October 1840. On 1 November 1854 he became acting director, and was appointed director permanently on 26 May 1855. He succeeded Peder Christian Holst. Landmark personally constructed the Landmark conversion, a modification of the "kammerlader" rifles to allow them to fire rim fire ammunition, as opposed to being caplock weapons. The model was used by the Royal Norwegian Navy. During Landmark's time as director, the factory saw some significant progresses. In 1871 the branch line of the Randsfjord Railway Line from Hokksund to Kongsberg was completed, making transportation much easier. Also, new production demands, as the Remington (1867) and Krag-Petersson (1876) rifles were taken into use, led to expansions.
In 1862 Landmark was elected to the Norwegian Parliament, representing the constituency of Kongsberg. He was re-elected on two non-consecutive occasions, in 1868 and 1880. Both his father and uncle had been members of Parliament. On the local political level, Jens Landmark was mayor of Kongsberg in 1851 (Sjur Aasmundsen Sexe was mayor from January to March), 1853, 1856 and 1864, and deputy mayor in 1855 and 1861.
In addition, he was still enrolled with the military, and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on 30 January 1864. In addition, he was proclaimed Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1860, as well as Knight of the Swedish Order of the Sword.
Jens Landmark died in 1880 in Kongsberg. He was succeeded as factory director by Ole Herman Krag. A street in Kongsberg was named for him.

Stratasys

Stratasys, Ltd. is a manufacturer of 3D printers and 3D production systems for office-based rapid prototyping and direct digital manufacturing solutions. Engineers use Stratasys systems to model complex geometries in a wide range of thermoplastic materials, including: ABS, polyphenylsulfone (PPSF), polycarbonate (PC) and ULTEM 9085. 
Stratasys manufactures in-office prototyping and direct digital manufacturing systems for automotive, aerospace, industrial, recreational, electronic, medical and consumer product OEMs.
History.
Stratasys was founded in 1989, by S. Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The idea for the technology came to Crump in 1988 when he decided to make a toy frog for his young daughter using a glue gun loaded with a mixture of polyethylene and candle wax. He thought of creating the shape layer by layer and of a way to automate the process. In April 1992, Stratasys sold its first product, the 3D Modeler.
In October 1994, Stratasys had an initial public offering on NASDAQ; the company sold 1.38 million shares of common stock at $5 per share, netting approximately $5.7 million.
In January 1995, Stratasys purchased IBM's rapid prototyping intellectual property and other assets and employed 16 former IBM engineers, who had been developing a small 3-D printer that relied on an extrusion system very similar to Crump's patented fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology. 
In 2003, Stratasys fused deposition modeling (FDM) was the best-selling rapid prototyping technology. FDM is a process that the company patented, which is used to produce three-dimensional parts directly from 3D CAD files layer-by-layer for use in design verification, prototyping, development and manufacturing. 
In 2007, Stratasys supplied 44% of all additive fabrication systems installed worldwide, making it the unit market leader for the sixth consecutive year.
In January 2010, Stratasys signed an agreement with HP to manufacture HP-branded 3D printers. In August 2012, the 
HP manufacturing and distribution agreement was discontinued.
In 2012, an unrelated project to produce a working firearm by 3D printing was intended to use a Stratasys printer. Stratasys refused to permit this and withdrew their license for use of the printer, citing that it did not allow its printers "to be used for illegal purposes".
Merger with Objet.
On April 16, 2012, Stratasys announced that it agreed to merge with privately held Objet Ltd., a leading manufacturer of 3D printers based in Rehovot, Israel, in an all-stock transaction. Stratasys shareholders were expected to own 55 percent of the combined company, and Objet shareholders would own 45 percent. The merger was completed on December 3, 2012; the market capitalization of the new company was approximately $3.0 billion.
Acquisition of MakerBot.
On June 19, 2013, MakerBot Industries announced that it was purchased by Stratasys for $403 million.

Weed

Weed is an every day term used in a variety of senses, usually to describe a plant considered undesirable within a certain context. The word—commonly applied to unwanted plants in human-controlled settings, such as farm fields, gardens, lawns, and parks—carries no botanical classification value, since a plant that is a weed in one context is "not" a weed when growing where it is wanted. Indeed, a number of plants that many consider weeds are often intentionally grown in gardens and other cultivated settings. Less commonly, the term is applied to any plant that grows and reproduces aggressively outside its native habitat. The term is occasionally used to broadly describe species outside the plant kingdom that can live in diverse environments and reproduce quickly, and has even been applied to humans.
Ecological role.
Weeds generally share similar adaptations that give them advantages and allow them to proliferate in disturbed environments where soil or natural vegetative cover has been damaged. Different types of habitat and disturbances will result in colonization by different communities of weed species.
Naturally occurring disturbed environments include dunes and other windswept areas with shifting soils, alluvial flood plains, river banks and deltas, and areas that are often burned. Since human agricultural practices often mimic these natural environments where weedy species have evolved, weeds have adapted to grow and proliferate in human-disturbed areas such as agricultural fields, lawns, roadsides, and construction sites. The weedy nature of these species often gives them an advantage over more desirable crop species because they often grow quickly and reproduce quickly, have seeds that persist in the soil seed bank for many years, or have short lifespans with multiple generations in the same growing season. Perennial weeds often have underground stems that spread out under the soil surface or, like ground ivy ("Glechoma hederacea"), have creeping stems that root and spread out over the ground.
Some plants become dominant when introduced into new environments because the animals which specialize in feeding on them are absent; in what is sometimes called the “natural enemies hypothesis”, plants freed from these specialist consumers may increase their competitive ability. In locations where predation and mutual competitive relationships no longer exist, some plants are able to increase allocation of resources into growth or reproduction. The weediness of some species that are introduced into new environments may be caused by their production of allelopathic chemicals which indigenous plants are not yet adapted to, a scenario sometimes called the "novel weapons hypothesis". These chemicals may limit the growth of established plants or the germination and growth of seeds and seedlings.
Dispersal.
Many weed species have moved out of their natural geographic ranges and spread around the world in tandem with human migrations and commerce. Weed seeds are often collected and transported with crops after the harvesting of grains, so humans are a vector of transport as well as a producer of the disturbed environments to which weed species are well adapted, resulting in many weeds having a close association with human activities.
Some weed species have been classified as noxious weeds by government authorities because, if left unchecked, they often compete with native or crop plants or cause harm to livestock. They are often foreign species accidentally or imprudently imported into a region where there are few natural controls to limit their population and spread.
Competition with cultivated and endemic plants.
Weeds may be unwanted for a number of reasons. An important one is that they interfere with food and fiber production in agriculture, wherein they must be controlled in order to prevent lost or diminished crop yields. Other important reasons are that they interfere with other cosmetic, decorative, or recreational goals, such as in lawns, landscape architecture, playing fields, and golf courses. Similarly, they can be of concern for environmental reasons whereby introduced species out-compete for resources or space with desired endemic plants. For all these reasons; horticulture, both functional and cosmetic, and environmental, - weeds interfere by:
In weed ecology some authorities speak of the relationship between "the three Ps": plant, place, perception. These have been very variously defined, but the weed traits listed by H.G. Baker are widely cited.
Weeds have long been a concern, perhaps as long as humans have cultivated plants. They are mentioned in various historic texts, such as a Shakespearean sonnet:"To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: / But why thy odour matcheth not thy show, / The soil is this, that thou dost common grow."
Benefits of weed species.
While the term "weed" generally has a negative connotation, many plants known as weeds can have beneficial properties. A number of weeds, such as the dandelion ("Taraxacum"), are edible, and their leaves or roots may be used for food or herbal medicine. Burdock is common over much of the world, and is sometimes used to make soup and medicine in East Asia. Some weeds attract beneficial insects, which in turn can protect crops from harmful pests. Weeds can also prevent pest insects from finding a crop, because their presence disrupts the incidence of positive cues which pests use to locate their food. Weeds may also act as a "living mulch", providing ground cover that reduces moisture loss and prevents erosion. Weeds may also improve soil fertility; dandelions, for example, bring up nutrients like calcium and nitrogen from deep in the soil with their tap root, and clover hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its roots, fertilizing the soil directly. The dandelion is also one of several species which break up hardpan in overly cultivated fields, helping crops grow deeper root systems. Some garden flowers originated as weeds in cultivated fields and have been selectively bred for their garden-worthy flowers or foliage. An example of a crop weed that is grown in gardens is the corncockle, ("Agrostemma githago"), which was a common weed in European wheat fields, but is now sometimes grown as a garden plant.
Some people have appreciated weeds for their tenacity, their wildness and even the work and connection to nature they provide. As Christopher Lloyd wrote in "The Well-Tempered Garden"
"Many gardeners will agree that hand-weeding is not the terrible drudgery that it is often made out to be. Some people find in it a kind of soothing monotony. It leaves their minds free to develop the plot for their next novel or to perfect the brilliant repartee with which they should have encountered a relative's latest example of unreasonableness."
Shunryu Suzuki, the Zen master, is credited with proclaiming, "For Zen students, a weed is a treasure."
Weeds as adaptable species.
An alternate definition often used by biologists is any species, not just plants, that can quickly adapt to any environment. Some traits of weedy species are the ability to reproduce quickly, disperse widely, live in a variety of habitats, establish a population in strange places, succeed in disturbed ecosystems and resist eradication once established. Such species often do well in human-dominated environments as other species are not able to adapt. Common examples include the common pigeon, brown rat and the raccoon. Other weedy species have been able to expand their range without actually living in human environments, as human activity has damaged the ecosystems of other species. These include the coyote, the white-tailed deer and the brown headed cowbird.
In response to the idea that humans may face extinction due to environmental degradation, paleontologist David Jablonsky counters by arguing that humans are a weed species. Like other weedy species, humans are widely dispersed in a wide variety of environments, and are highly unlikely to go extinct no matter how much damage the environment faces.
Role in mass extinctions.
A mass extinction is generally caused by some abrupt disruption to the entire planet's environment. This results in major changes in habitat worldwide, and most endemic species, specially adapted to a single habitat, cannot survive in the new habitats. Thus only weedy species survive, and they dominate the planet in the immediate aftermath. Cockroaches, for example, have survived several mass extinctions. The current Holocene extinction event, then, could lead to a planet inhabited entirely by what are known today as weeds. The fossil record indicates that after mass extinctions, a weed-dominated planet persists for five to ten million years before life re-diversifies.
Plants often considered to be weeds.
A short list of some plants that often are considered to be weeds follows:

U.S. Route 40 in Colorado

In the U.S. state of Colorado, U.S. Route 40 is a major east–west route. It crosses the Rocky Mountains, passing over the Continental Divide at Berthoud Pass before descending to the front range. It then traverses through the Denver Metro Area, then exits by following I-70 and US 287. It is concurrent with US 287 for about 145 miles to Kit Carson. US 40 exits into Kansas east of Arapahoe in Cheyenne.
Route description.
Entering Colorado to the south of Dinosaur National Monument, U.S. 40 runs east through the small town of Dinosaur along Brontosaurus Boulevard. The route continues a generally easterly course though Moffat and Routt counties, passing through several small communities along the way. It generally follows the course of the Yampa River. U.S. 40 becomes Lincoln Avenue as it runs through historic downtown Steamboat Springs, Colorado.
Taking a circuitous route through Rabbit Ears Pass, Muddy Pass and Berthoud Pass it descends the escarpment along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains. Just to the east of Empire, it merges with Interstate 70 for the first time. US 40 and I-70 will frequently share pavement across the U.S. The route leaves I-70 at exit 244, to the west of Idaho Springs and rejoins it again at between exits 252 and 254 in El Rancho. It parallels I-70, mostly as a frontage road, until the intersection with State Highway 26 to the south of Golden
Beginning in Golden, US 40 becomes Colfax Avenue, the main east–west thoroughfare through the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area. Along with US 40, the entire route along Colfax Avenue is cosigned as Business Loop 70. The route travels northeast through Golden, then turns due east to travel through Lakewood, Denver, and Aurora. Among the sights to be seen along US 40 is Lake Steam Bath, once the location of a thriving health industry centered on tuberculosis sanatoriums. Also along Colfax Avenue in Denver is the Denver branch of the United States Mint, which produces 50 million coins per day. US 40 rejoins I-70 at exit 288, just to the east of Aurora.
At exit 359 in Limon, US 40 leaves I-70 along Main Street, which it shares with Business Loop 70, US 24, US 287, and SH 71. US 40/US 287 continues to the southeast to the town of Kit Carson. From there, it leaves US 287 and continues east through the towns of Cheyenne Wells and Arapahoe before entering the state of Kansas.

John Acropolis

John ("Little Caesar") Acropolis (1909 - August 26, 1952), was an American labor leader. He served as president of Local 456 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in Westchester County, NY from 1946 until his death.
Acropolis was orphaned at age three and raised in a series of charitable institutions. He attended Colgate University where he played on the basketball team.
Acropolis became interested in union issues while working as a truck driver during summer break from college. He joined Local 456 and was first elected as a union officer in the early 1940s.
After becoming president of Local 456, Acropolis challenged the Genovese crime family over its control of certain garbage carting contracts in the suburbs of New York City. He expanded the size of his local to more than 2,000 members.
Acropolis was killed in 1952 by an unknown assailant who fired two bullets into his head. The case has not been solved.
In October, 2008, the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the Yonkers, New York Police Department, demanding access to the department's file on the investigation into the death of Acropolis. The City of Yonkers said it would fight the lawsuit, claiming that because the investigation was still technically active, the case file was not subject to Freedom of Information laws.

Spawn (biology)

Spawn is the eggs and sperm released or deposited, usually into water, by aquatic animals. As a verb, spawn refers to the process of releasing the eggs and sperm, also called spawning. Most aquatic animals, apart from aquatic mammals, reproduce through a process of spawning.
Spawn consists of the reproductive cells (gametes) of aquatic animals, some of which will become fertilized and produce offspring. The process of spawning typically involves females releasing ova (unfertilized eggs) into the water, often in large quantities, while males simultaneously or sequentially release spermatozoa (milt) to fertilize the eggs.
Most fish reproduce by spawning, and so do most other aquatic animals, including crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps, molluscs such as oysters and squid, echinoderms such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers, amphibians such as frogs and newts, other amphibious animals such as turtles, aquatic insects such as mayflies and mosquitoes, and corals (which are small aquatic animals and not plants). Fungi, such as mushrooms, are also said to "spawn" a white fibrous matter that forms the matrix from which they grow.
There are many variations in the way spawning occurs, depending on sexual differences in anatomy, on how the sexes relate to each other, on where and how the spawn is released, and on whether or how the spawn is subsequently guarded.
Overview.
Marine animals, and particularly bony fish, commonly reproduce by "broadcast spawning". This is an external method of reproduction where the female releases many unfertilised eggs into the water. At the same time, a male or many males release a lot of sperm into the water which fertilises some of these eggs. The eggs contain a drop of nutrient oil to sustain the embryo as it develops inside the egg case. The oil also provides buoyancy, so the eggs float and drift with the current. The strategy for survival of broadcast spawning is to disperse the fertilised eggs, preferably away from the coast into the relative safety of the open ocean. There the larvae develop as they consume their fat stores, and eventually hatch from the egg capsule into miniature versions of their parents.
To survive, they must then become miniature predators themselves, feeding on plankton. Fish eventually encounter others of their own kind (conspecifics), where they form aggregations and learn to school.
Internally, the sexes of most marine animals can be determined by looking at the gonads. For example, male testes of spawning fish are smooth and white and account for up to 12% of the mass of the fish, while female ovaries are granular and orange or yellow, accounting for up to 70% of the fish's mass. Male lampreys, hagfish and salmon discharge their sperm into the body cavity where it is expelled through pores in the abdomen. Male sharks and rays can pass sperm along a duct into a seminal vesicle, where they store it for a while before it is expelled, while teleosts usually employ separate sperm ducts.
Externally, many marine animals, even when spawning, show little sexual dimorphism (difference in body shape or size) or little difference in colouration. Where species are dimorphic, such as sharks or guppies, the males often have penis-like intromittent organs in the form of a modified fin.
A species is semelparous if its individuals spawn only once in their lifetime, and iteroparous if its individuals spawn more than once. The term semelparity comes from the Latin "semel", once, and "pario", to beget, while iteroparity comes from "itero", to repeat, and "pario", to beget.
Semelparity is sometimes called "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large and fatal to the spawners. The classic example of a semelparous animal is the Pacific salmon,which lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and then dying. Other spawning animals which are semelparous include mayflies, squid, octopus, smelt, capelin and some amphibians. Semelparity is often associated with r-strategists. However, most fish and other spawning animals are iteroparous.
When the internal ovaries or egg masses of fish and certain marine animals are ripe for spawning they are called roe. Roe from certain species, such as shrimp, scallop, crab and sea urchins, are sought as human delicacies in many parts of the world. "Caviar" is a name for the processed, salted roe of non-fertilized sturgeon. The term "soft roe" or "white roe" denotes fish milt. Lobster roe is called "coral" because it turns bright red when cooked. Roe (reproductive organs) are usually eaten either raw or briefly cooked.
"The reproductive behaviour of fishes is remarkably diversified: they may be oviparous (lay eggs), ovoviparous (retain the eggs in the body until they hatch), or viviparous (have a direct tissue connection with the developing embryos and give birth to live young). All cartilaginous fishes—the elasmobranches (e.g., sharks, rays, and skates)—employ internal fertilization and usually lay large, heavy-shelled eggs or give birth to live young. The most characteristic features of the more primitive bony fishes is the assemblage of polyandrous (many males) breeding aggregations in open water and the absence of parental care..."
There are two main reproduction methods in fish. The first method is by laying eggs and the second by "live-bearing" (producing their young alive).
Sexual strategies.
Basic strategies.
Monogamy occurs when one male mates with one female exclusively. This is also called "pair spawning". Most fish are not monogamous, and when they are, they often alternate with non-monogamous behaviours. Monogamy can occur when feeding and breeding grounds are small, when it is difficult for fish to find partners, or when both sexes look after the young. Many tropical cichlids, which rear their young together in locations where they must fiercely defend against competitors and predators are monogamous. "In some pipefishes and seahorses, development of eggs takes a long time before the female can place them in the brood pouch of a male, where they are fertilized. While the male is pregnant, the female starts a new batch of eggs, which are ready at about the same time that the male gives birth to the young from the previous mating. This close timing of development promotes monogamy, especially if the likelihood of encountering another potential mate is low.
Polygyny occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In polygyny a large conspicuous male usually defends females from other males or defends a breeding site. The females choose large males that are successfully defending prime breeding sites which the females find attractive. For example, sculpin males defend "caves" underneath rocks which are suitable for the incubation of embryos.
Another way males get to mate with several females is through the use of leks. Leks are places where many fish come together, and the males display to each another. Based on these displays, each female then selects the male they want to be their mate. For example, among the cichlid "Cyrtocara eucinostomus" in Lake Malawi, up to 50,000 large and colourful males display together on a lek four kilometres long. The females, which are mouth brooders, choose which male they want to fertilize their eggs.
Polyandry occurs when one female gets exclusive mating rights with multiple males. This is not common, but it does happen among fish like clownfish that change their sex. It can also happen when males do the brooding but can cannot handle all the eggs the female produce, such as with some pipefish.
The males in some deep sea anglerfishes are much smaller than the females. When they find a female they bite into her skin, releasing an enzyme that digests the skin of their mouth and her body and fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly atrophies, losing first his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, ending as nothing more than a pair of gonads, which release sperm in response to hormones in the female's bloodstream indicating egg release. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. A single anglerfish female can "mate" with many males in this manner.
Polygynandry occurs when multiple males mate indiscriminately with multiple females. This mutual promiscuity is the approach most commonly used by spawning animals, and is perhaps the "original fish mating system." Common examples are forage fish, such as herrings, which form huge mating shoals in shallow water. The water becomes milky with sperm and the bottom is draped with millions of fertilized eggs.
Cuckoldry.
Alternate male strategies which allow small males to engage in cuckoldry can develop in species where spawning is dominated by large and aggressive males. Cuckoldry is a variant of polyandry, and can occur with "sneak spawners" (sometimes called "streak spawners"). A sneak spawner is a male that rushes in to join the spawning rush of a spawning pair. A spawning rush occurs when a fish makes a burst of speed, usually on a near vertical incline, releasing gametes at the apex, followed by a rapid return to the lake or sea floor or fish aggregation. Sneaking males do not take part in courtship. In salmon and trout, for example, "jack males" are common. These are small silvery males that migrate upstream along with the standard, large, hook-nosed males and that spawn by sneaking into redds to release sperm simultaneously with a mated pair. This behaviour is an evolutionarily stable strategy for reproduction, because it is favoured by natural selection just like the "standard" strategy of large males.
Cuckoldry occurs in many fish species, including dragonets, parrotfishes and wrasses on tropical reefs and the bluegill sunfish in fresh water. Sneaker males that becomes too large to hide effectively become "satellite males". With bluegill sunfish, satellite males mimic the behaviour and colouration of the females. They hover over a nest containing a pair of courting sunfish, and gradually descend to reach the pair just as they spawn. "Both sneaker and satellite males are usually badly chewed up by irate parental males by the end of the spawning season, but their strategy is nevertheless a successful one (giving them high fitness). Because these smaller males do not have to spend any energy on parental care, they can spawn at a much younger age than the parental males. Parental males may be 6 or 7 years old before they are large enough to compete successfully for the best nest sites, but the sneaker and satellite males may be only 2 or 3 years old."
Hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternate between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with gonochorism, where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of teleost fishes. "Hermaphrodites can be either "synchronous", in which individuals possess both ovarian and testicular tissue, or "sequential", in which individuals change sex. Synchronous hermaphrodites are uncommon. Among the best studied is the black hamlet, a species in which individuals take turns releasing sperm and eggs during spawning. Because such egg trading is advantageous to both individuals, hamlets are typically monogamous for short periods of time–an unusual situation in fishes. The most common pattern, known as Synchronous hermaphroditism, is for a female to change into a male (protogyny). This often happens when a large, dominant male controlling a harem of females is removed by a predator. Within a few days, the largest female in the harem becomes a dominant male and takes over the missing male's function. This pattern is common in coral reef fishes, such as parrotfishes, wrasses, and groupers. Less common than protogyny is protandry, in which a male converts to a female."
The sex of many fishes is not fixed, but can change with physical and social changes to the environment where the fish lives. "Sex change occurs mainly in fishes in which one sex had higher survival and reproductive rates, usually as the result of larger size. In such situations it may pay for an individual of the smaller sex to change to the larger sex when the opportunity arises. For example anemone fishes live as monogamous pairs in single anemones, protected from predators by the stings of the anemone. Female anemone fish are typically larger than males, because a male does not have to vigorously compete for mates once he has paired with a female. If the female dies, however, a juvenile anemone fish quickly moves in; such fish are always male. The resident male then turns into a female and reproductive advantages of the large female–small male combination continue. In some fishes, sex change is reversible, depending on the social situation. Thus some gobies will switch sex when kept in what initially were single sex groups of either sex."
Unisexuality.
Unisexuality occurs when a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, and can take complex forms. "Squalius alburnoides", a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, appears to be an all-male species. The existence of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is diploid, but not hermaphroditic. It can have triploid and tetraploid forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through hybridogenesis.
It is rare to find true parthenogenesis in fishes, where females produce female offspring with no input from males. All-female species include the Texas silverside, "Menidia clarkhubbsi" as well as a complex of Mexican mollies. Parthenogenesis has been recently observed in hammerhead sharks and blacktip sharks. It is also known to occur in crayfish and amphibians.
Spawning strategies.
This section is patterned after a classification of the spawning behaviours of fish by Balon (1975, 1984) into reproductive guilds. This classification is based on how the eggs are fertilized (internal or external spawners), where the eggs are deposited (pelagic or benthic spawners), and whether and how the parents look after the eggs after spawning (bearers, guarders and nonguarders).
Nonguarders.
Nonguarders do not protect their eggs and offspring after spawning
Open substrate spawners.
Open substrate spawners scatter their eggs in the environment. They usually spawn in shoals without complex courtship rituals, and males outnumber females.
Broadcast spawners: release their gametes (sperm and eggs) into open water for external fertilisation. There is no subsequent parental care. About 75% of coral species are broadcasters, the majority of which are hermatypic, or reef-building corals.
Brood hiders.
Brood hiders hide their eggs but do not give parental care after they have hidden them. Brood hiders are mostly benthic spawners that bury the fertilized eggs. For example, among salmon and trout the female digs a nest with her tail in gravel. These nests are called redds. The female then lays her eggs while the male fertilizes them, while both fish defend the redd if necessary from other members of the same species. Then the female buries the nest, and the nest site is abandoned. In North America, some minnows build nests out of piles of stones rather than dig holes. The minnow males have tubercles on their head and body which they use to help them defend the nest site.
Bitterlings have a remarkable reproduction strategy where parents transfer responsibility for the care of their young to mussels. The female extends her ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalant water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.
Guarders.
Guarders protect their eggs and offspring after spawning by practicing "parental care" (also called "brood care"). Parental care is an "investment by parents in offspring that increases the offsprings' chances of surviving (and hence reproducing). In fish, parental care can take a variety of forms including guarding, nest building, fanning, splashing, removal of dead eggs, retrieval of straying fry, external egg carrying, egg burying, moving eggs or young, ectodermal feeding, oral brooding, internal gestation, brood-pouch egg carrying, etc."
Territorial behaviour is generally necessary for guarders, and the embryos are almost always guarded by males (apart from cichlids). There is a need to be territorial because looking after embryos usually includes defending the site where they are being looked after. It also often means there is competition for the best egg-laying sites. Elaborate courtship behaviour is usual among guarders.
Guarding males keep the embryos safe from predators, keep oxygen levels high by fanning water currents, and keep the area free from dead embryos and debris. They protect the embryos until they hatch, and often look after the larval stages as well. The time spent guarding can range from a few days to several months.
Substrate spawners.
Some guarders build nests ("nest spawners") and some do not ("substrate spawners"), though the difference between the two groups can be small. Substrate spawners clean off a suitable area of surface suitable for egg laying, and look after the area, but they do not actively build a nest.
Nest spawners.
Nest spawners construct "some sort of structure, cavity, or pit in which the eggs are laid and fertilized and the embryos are defended. The young are often defended in a nest as well, and in some species, the parents even herd schools of young around for a period of time. Pit nests can be made of a wide variety of material, but the most common are nests of gravel and rocks. Such nests are typically shallow depressions that are carefully constructed and tended by territorial males. Most sunfishes and black basses (Centrarchidae) construct nests of this sort, often in colonies. The males defend the embryos and the young until the young become too active to be kept in the nest. In some cichlids eggs are laid and incubated in one nest depression, but the young are tended (by both parents) in one or more additional depressions that are constructed nearby."
"A few species construct nests on sandy bottoms. Either the eggs and embryos in such nests have special adaptations (e.g., semibuoyancy) to reduce the possibility of being smothered, or the parent fish must spend considerable time handling them."
"In areas where bottoms are muddy, nest-building fish commonly build nests of plant material. Usually plant-nesting fishes construct loose aggregations of material in which the eggs are laid. One special type of plant-nest builder uses a kidney secretion to glue the pieces of plant together to form a tight nest. The main examples of this type of nesting are the sticklebacks in which the male builds a tube which is usually attached to rooted plants or is placed in a small pit. By means of a complicated courtship ritual, a female is enticed into a nest, where she deposits some eggs after being nudged by the male. After the eggs are laid, he chases the female out and fertilizes them. This process is repeated several times, until enough embryos are in the nest and the male begins to incubate them by fanning currents of water across them. After the embryos hatch, the male guards the young for several days, first in the nest, and then in a shoal outside the nest."
"Perhaps the most common type of nests among fishes are those in caves, cavities, or burrows. These nests are characteristic of fish that live in active habitats, such as rocky intertidal zone or streams. For stream-dwelling fishes, the typical cave nest is the underside of a flat rock in midstream, which has plenty of current to keep the water well oxygenated. Sculpins and many darters deposit their eggs in clusters on the roofs of such shelters and then guard the embryos until they hatch. In quieter water, minnows, such as the fathead minnow, lay their eggs on the underside of a log or a board in an area that has been cleaned off by the male. Spawning males develop a thick horny pad on their head, which is used for rubbing algae and other materials of the spawning surface. Many large catfishes lay their eggs in cavities ranging from hollow logs to old muskrat burrows to oil drums, where the embryoes are guarded by the males. These catfish also guard schools of young for one or more weeks after they emerge from the nest."
Bearers.
Bearers are fish that carry their embryos (and sometimes their young) around with them, either externally or internally.
External bearers.
"Fishes that carry their embryos externally have developed a wide variety of ways for doing so, ranging from the short-term attachment of embryos to the adult until a suitable place is found to put them ("transfer brooders") to the carrying of embryos and young in special pouches. Good examples of various kinds of bearers can be found amongst pipefishes and seahorses. In this family, only the males do the brooding. After the eggs are fertilized, the female places the embryos on the male. Herald (1950) notes a continuum of forms in the Syngnathidae, starting with skin-brooding pipefishes and ending with seahorses, which have closed pouches with only one opening. In seahorses, after an extended courtship period, the female deposits eggs in the pouch (marsupium) of the male by means of a penis-like oviduct. The eggs are fertilized as they enter the marsupium, and 25 to 100 embryos are provided with nutrients, oxygen and protection (Jones and Avise 1997). After hatching, the free embryos are carried in the pouch until they are capable of fairly active swimming, at which time they are expelled by the brooding male."
"Another method of internally carrying young that are spawned externally occurs in "mouth brooders". This method is found in families as diverse as sea catfishes, cichlids, cardinal fishes and bonytongues. Mouthbrooders carry the large, yolky embryos until they hatch, and these brooders typically carry the free embryos about as well. Even after the young become active, they are usually closely associated with the parent fish for a period of time and may flee back into the mouth cavity when threatened. In cichlids, both sexes may participate in some species, but the female usually carries the embryos, which she picks up quickly after spawning."
Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae in their mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs in a pit, which are sucked up into the mouth of the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are colorful spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.
Internal bearers.
"Internal bearers may have similarities to pouch brooders, although fertilization is internal and females always carry the embryos and/or young. Internal bearers typically produce only a small number of large, active young, which is a strategy characteristic of all sharks and rays and a few bony fish. There seems to be no strong correlation between internal bearing families and the elaborateness of courtship behaviour. In guppies, mosquitofish and other livebearing poeciliids. the most important trait of the courtship behaviour of males that successfully copulate with females seems to be persistence (although subtle interactions among competing males and other courtship-related behaviour do exist). In contrast, some surfperches have fairly elaborate courtship behaviour, with males establishing breeding territories to attract passing females."
Facultative internal bearers: The beginning of the evolutionary process of livebearing starts with "facultative" (optional) internal bearing. The process occurs in several species of oviparous (egg-laying) killifishes which spawn in the normal way on the substrate, but in the process accidentally fertilize eggs which the female retains and does not spawn. These eggs are spawned later, usually without allowing much time for embryonic development.
Obligate internal bearers: The next step in the evolution of livebearing is "obligate" (by necessity) internal bearing, where the female retains all the embryos. "The only source of nutrition for these embryos, however, is the egg yolk, as in externally spawned eggs. This situation, also referred to as ovoviviparity, is characteristic of marine rock fishes and the Lake Baikal sculpins. This strategy allows these fish to have fecundities approaching those of pelagic fish with external fertilization, but it also enables them to protect the young during their most vulnerable stage of development. By contrast, sharks and rays using this strategy produce a relatively small number of embryos and retain them for a few weeks to 16 months or longer. The shorter times spans are characteristic of species that eventually deposit their embryos in the environment, surrounded by a horny capsule; whereas the longer periods are characteristic of sharks that retain the embryos until they are ready to emerge as actively swimming young."
Viviparous fish: "Given the advantages of retaining the embryos internally, it is not surprising that a number of fishes have developed means to provide additional nutrition for their young while the female is carrying them and then give birth to large, active young ("viviparity"). Viviparous fishes provide nutrition for their young in various ways. The greatest variety occurs in sharks, but the teleosts also show a considerable range of methods. In the superperches, the young develop in the mother's ovary and obtain nutrients through the close contact of the extra-large fins with the ovarian wall. Many poeciliid embryos have highly vascular pericardial tissue that loops around the neck and is in close contact with the ovarian wall of the mother, through which nutrients are exchanged."
However, some fish do not fit these categories. The livebearing largespring gambusia ("Gambusia geiseri") was thought to be ovoviviparous until it was shown in 2001 that the embryos received nutrients from the mother.
Spawning grounds.
Spawning grounds are the areas of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn may or may not drift to new grounds which become their nursery grounds. Many species undertake migrations each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for anadromous fish such as salmon. These days, it is often necessary to construct fish ladders and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds. Coastal fish often use mangroves and estuaries as spawning grounds, while reef fish can find adjacent seagrass meadows that make good spawning grounds. Short-finned eels can travel anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to their spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea.
Forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern Norway, their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.
Capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and other crustaceans. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.
The diagram on the right shows the main spawning grounds and larval drift routes. Capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green, capelin on the way back is blue, and the breeding grounds are red. In a paper published in 2009, researchers from Iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008.
Referred to as "the greatest shoal on earth", the sardine run occurs when millions of sardines migrate from their spawning grounds south of the southern tip of Africa northward along the Eastern Cape coastline. Chinook salmon make the longest freshwater migration of any salmon, over up the Yukon River to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse, Yukon. Some green sea turtles swim more than to reach their spawning grounds.
Examples.
Fish.
Goldfish, like all cyprinids, are egg-layers. They usually start breeding after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.
A member of the Cyprinidae family, carp spawn in times between April and August, largely dependant upon the climate and conditions they live in. Oxygen levels of the water, availability of food, size of each fish, age, number of times the fish has spawned before and water temperature are all factors known to effect when and how many eggs each carp will spawn at any one time.
Prior to spawning, male Siamese fighting fish build bubble nests of varying sizes at the surface of the water. When a male becomes interested in a female, he will flare his gills, twist his body, and spread his fins. The female darkens in colour and curves her body back and forth. The act of spawning takes place in a "nuptial embrace" where the male wraps his body around the female, each embrace resulting in the release of 10-40 eggs until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, from his side, releases milt into the water and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she will simply devour all the eggs that she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as it is likely that she'll eat the eggs due to hunger. The eggs then remain in the male's care. He keeps them in the bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom and repairing the nest as needed. Incubation lasts for 24–36 hours, and the newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next 2–3 days, until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins.
Crustaceans.
[[File:California spiny lobster.JPG|thumb|right|California spiny lobster
Copepods are tiny crustaceans which usually reproduce either by "broadcast spawning" or by "sac spawning". Broadcasting copepods scatter their eggs into the water, but sac spawners lay their eggs into an ovigerous sac. Sac spawners spawn few but relatively large eggs that develop slowly. By contrast, broadcast spawners spawn numerous small eggs that develop rapidly. However, the shorter hatch times that result from broadcasting are not short enough to compensate for the higher mortality compared to sac spawners. To produce a given number of hatched eggs, broadcasters must spawn more eggs than sac spawners.
After mating, the fertilized eggs of the California spiny lobster are carried on the female's pleopods until they hatch, with between 120,000 and 680,000 carried by a single female. The eggs begin coral red, but darken as they develop to a deep maroon. When she is carrying the eggs, the female is said to be "berried". The eggs are ready to hatch after 10 weeks, and spawning takes place from May to August,> The larvae that hatch (called "phyllosoma" larvae) do not resemble the adults. Instead, they are flat, transparent animals around long, but as thin as a sheet of paper. The larvae feed on plankton, and grow through ten molts into ten further larval stages, the last of which is around long. The full series of larval molts takes around 7 months, and when the last stage molts, it metamorphoses into the "puerulus" state, which is a juvenile form of the adult, though still transparent. The puerulus larvae settle to the sea floor when the water is near its maximum temperature, which in Baja California is in the fall.
Egg-bearing female lobsters migrate inshore from deeper waters to hatch their eggs, though they do not have specific spawning grounds. These lobster migrations can occur in close single-file formation "lobster trains".
Molluscs.
Oysters are "broadcast spawners", that is, eggs and sperm are released into open water where fertilisation occurs. They are protandric; during their first year they spawn as males by releasing sperm into the water. As they grow over the next two or three years and develop greater energy reserves, they spawn as females by releasing eggs. Bay oysters usually spawn by the end of June. An increase in water temperature prompts a few oysters to spawn. This triggers spawning in the rest, clouding the water with millions of eggs and sperm. A single female oyster can produce up to 100 million eggs annually. The eggs become fertilized in the water and develop rapidly into planktonic larvae. which eventually find suitable sites, such as another oyster's shell, on which to settle. Attached oyster larvae are called spat. Spat are oysters less than long.
The Pacific oyster usually has separate sexes. Their sex can be determined by examining the gonads, and it can change from year to year, normally during the winter months. In certain environmental conditions, one sex is favoured over the other. Protandry is favoured in areas of high food abundance and protogyny occurs in areas of low food abundance. In habitats with a high food supply, the sex ratio in the adult population tends to favour females, and areas with low food abundances tend to have a larger proportion of male adults. Spawning in the Pacific oyster occurs at . This species is very fecund, with females releasing about 50–200 million eggs in regular intervals (at a rate of 5–10 times a minute) in a single spawning. Once released from the gonads, the eggs move through the suprabranchial chambers (gills), are then pushed through the gill ostia into the mantle chamber, and are finally released in the water, forming a small cloud. In males, the sperm is released at the opposite end of the oyster, along with the normal exhalent stream of water. A rise in water temperature is thought to be the main cue in the initiation of spawning, as the onset of higher water temperatures in the summer results in earlier spawning in the Pacific oyster.
The larvae of the Pacific oyster are planktotrophic, and are about 70 µm at the prodissoconch 1 stage. The larvae move through the water column via the use of a larval foot to find suitable settlement locations. They can spend several weeks at this phase, which is dependent on water temperature, salinity and food supply. Over these weeks, larvae can disperse great distances by water currents before they metamorphose and settle as small spat. Similar to other oyster species, once the Pacific oyster larvae find a suitable habitat, they attach to it permanently using cement secreted from a gland in their foot. After settlement, the larvae metamorphose into juvenile spat. The growth rate is very rapid in optimum environmental conditions, and market size can be achieved in 18 to 30 months.
Cephalopods, such as squid and octopuses, have prominent heads and a set of arms (tentacles) modified from the primitive foot of molluscs. All cephalopods are sexually dimorphic. However, they lack external sexual characteristics, so they use colour communication. A courting male approaches a likely looking mate flashing his brightest colours, often in rippling displays. If the other cephalopod is female and receptive, her skin will change colour to become pale, and mating will occur. If the other cephalopod remains brightly coloured, it is taken as a warning.
All cephalopods reproduce by spawning eggs. Most cephalopods use semi-internal fertilization where the male places his gametes inside the female's mantle cavity to fertilize the ova in the female's single ovary. The "penis" in most male cephalopods is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified sperm-carrying arm called a hectocotylus. That in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the "penis" is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female. In many cephalopods, mating occurs head to head and the male may simply transfer sperm to the female. Others may detach the sperm-carrying arm and leave it attached to the female. Deep water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacles. Penis elongation in the greater hooked squid may result in a penis that is as long as the mantle, head and arms combined.
Some species brood their fertilized eggs: female paper nautilus construct shelters for the young, while Gonatiid squid carry a larva-laden membrane from the hooks on their arms. Other cephalopods deposit their young under rocks and aerate them with their tentacles hatching. Mostly the eggs are left to their own devices; many squid lay sausage-like bunches of eggs in crevices or occasionally on the sea floor. Cuttlefish lay eggs separately in cases and attach them to coral or algal fronds. Like Pacific salmon, cephalopods are mostly semelparous, spawning many small eggs in one batch and then dying. Cephalopods usually live fast and die young. Most of the energy extracted from their food is used for growing, and they mature rapidly to their adult size. Some gain as much as 12% of their body mass each day. Most live for one to two years, reproducing and then dying shortly thereafter.
Echinoderms.
[[File:Sea urchin eggs.jpg|thumb|right|Sea urchins have five gonads. These gonads (roe) are a sought after as a delicacy.
Echinoderms are marine animals, widespread in all oceans, but not found in fresh water. Just below their skin is an endoskeleton composed of calcareous plates or ossicles.
Sea urchins are spiky echinoderms with spherical bodies which usually contain five gonads. They move slowly, feed mostly on seaweed, and are important for the diet of sea otters. Sea urchins are dioecious, having separate male and female sexes, although there is generally no easy way to distinguish the two. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water, where fertilization takes place. Their roe (male and female gonads) is soft and melting, with a colour ranging from orange to pale yellow, and is sought after as a human delicacy in many parts of the world.
Sea cucumbers are leathery echinoderms with elongated bodies which contain a single, branched gonad. They are found on the sea floor worldwide, and occur in great numbers on the deep sea floor where they often make up the majority of the animal biomass. They feed on plankton and decaying organic debris found at the sea bottom, catching food that flows by with their open tentacles or sifting through bottom sediments. Like sea urchins, most sea cucumbers reproduce by releasing sperm and ova into the ocean water. Depending on conditions, one organism can produce thousands of gametes.
Sea cucumbers are typically dioecious, with separate male and female individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles. Many species fertilise their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile sea cucumber. A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming larva, usually after about three days of development. This larva swims by means of a long band of cilia wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a barrel-shaped body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.
Amphibious animals.
Amphibians are found in and around fresh water lakes and ponds, but not in marine environments. Examples are frogs and toads, salamanders, newts and caecilians (which resemble snakes). They are cold-blooded animals that metamorphose from a juvenile water-breathing form, usually to an adult air-breathing form, though mudpuppies retain juvenile gills in adulthood.
Female frogs and toads usually spawn gelatinous egg masses containing thousands of eggs in water. Different species lay eggs in distinctive and identifiable ways. For example, the American toad lays long strings of eggs. The eggs are highly vulnerable to predation, so frogs have evolved many techniques to ensure the survival of the next generation. In colder areas the embryo is black to absorb more heat from the sun, which speeds up development. Most commonly, this involves synchronous reproduction. Many individuals will breed at the same time, overwhelming the actions of predators; the majority of the offspring will still die due to predation, but there is a greater chance some will survive. Another way in which some species avoid predators and the pathogens eggs are exposed to in ponds is to lay eggs on leaves above the pond, with a gelatinous coating designed to retain moisture. In these species the tadpoles drop into the water upon hatching. The eggs of some species laid out of water can detect vibrations of nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.
While the length of the egg stage depends on the species and environmental conditions, aquatic eggs generally hatch within one week. Unlike salamanders and newts, frogs and toads never become sexually mature while still in their larval stage. The hatched eggs continue life as tadpoles, which typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free living larvae are fully aquatic. They lack eyelids and have a cartilaginous skeleton, a lateral line system, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later) and tails with dorsal and ventral folds of skin for swimming. They quickly develop a gill pouch that covers the gills and the front legs; the lungs are also developed at an early stage as an accessory breathing organ. Some species which go through the metamorphosis inside the egg and hatch to small frogs never develop gills; instead there are specialised areas of skin that take care of respiration. Tadpoles also lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species usually have two elongate, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts in the upper jaw while the lower jaw has three rows of keradonts, surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can be lower (sometimes zero), or much higher. Tadpoles feed on algae, including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. Cannibalism has been observed among tadpoles. Early developers who gain legs may be eaten by the others, so the late bloomers survive longer.
[[File:Sea turtle eggs.jpg|thumb|right|Sea turtle laying eggs
Sea turtles are amphibious reptiles, but they are not amphibians. Reptiles belong to the class Reptilia while amphibians belong to the class Amphibia. These are two distinct taxonomic groups. Reptiles have scales and leathery skins, while the skins of amphibians are smooth and porous. Unlike frogs, sea turtle eggs have tough, leathery shells which allow them to survive on land without drying out.
Some sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding and spawning grounds. Green turtles have feeding grounds along the Brazilian coast. Each year, thousands of these turtles migrate about to their spawning ground, Ascension Island in the Atlantic, an island only across. Each year the returning turtles dig between 6,000 and 15,000 nests, often returning to the same beach from where they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males on the other hand visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate. Green sea turtles' mating is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings. After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line where she digs a hole with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. Litter size depends on the age of the female and species, but green turtle clutches range between 100 to 200. She then covers the nest with sand and returns to the sea.
At around 45 to 75 days, the eggs hatch during the night and the hatchlings instinctively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators such as gulls and crabs grab them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles. Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle. It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild. They are among the larger sea turtles, many more than a meter long and weighing up to .
Aquatic insects.
Aquatic insects also spawn. Mayflies "are famed for their short adult life. Some species have under an hour to mate and lay their eggs before they die. Their pre-adult stage, known as the subimago, may be even shorter - perhaps lasting just a few minutes before they moult into their adult form. Therefore a mayfly spends most of its life as a nymph, hidden from view under the water."
Corals.
Corals can be both gonochoristic (unisexual) and hermaphroditic, each of which can reproduce sexually and asexually. Reproduction also allows corals to settle new areas.
Corals predominantly reproduce sexually. 25% of hermatypic corals (stony corals) form single sex (gonochoristic) colonies, while the rest are hermaphroditic. About 75% of all hermatypic corals "broadcast spawn" by releasing gametes—eggs and sperm—into the water to spread offspring. The gametes fuse during fertilization to form a microscopic larva called a planula, typically pink and elliptical in shape. A typical coral colony form several thousand larvae per year to overcome the odds against formation of a new colony.
Planulae exhibit positive "phototaxis", swimming towards light to reach surface waters where they drift and grow before descending to seek a hard surface to which they can attach and establish a new colony. They also exhibit positive "sonotaxis", moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony very few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually 2–3 days, but can be up to 2 months. The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.
Synchronous spawning is very typical on the coral reef and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn on the same night. This synchrony is essential so that male and female gametes can meet. Corals must rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve lunar changes, sunset time, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. In some places the spawn can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes, typically at night.
Corals use two methods for sexual reproduction, which differ in whether the female gametes are released:
Fungi.
Fungi are not plants, and require different conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through photosynthesis, a process that converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, especially cellulose. While sunlight provides an energy source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their growth medium, through biochemical decomposition processes. This does not mean that light is an unnecessary requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal to induce fruiting. However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the growth medium. Instead of seeds, mushrooms reproduce sexually during underground growth, and asexually through spores. Either of these can be contaminated with airborne microorganisms, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop. Mycelium, or actively growing mushroom culture, is placed on growth substrate to seed or introduce mushrooms to grow on a substrate. This is also known as inoculation, spawning or adding spawn. Its main advantages are to reduce chances of contamination while giving mushrooms a firm beginning.

Timothy A. Connolly 3rd

Timothy A. Connolly 3rd (born May 27, 1958), aka "Timmy Connolly" and "TC", is a former South Boston bar owner and mortgage broker, who wore a wire inside the infamous Winter Hill Gang and helped the federal government indict their two leaders, James "Whitey" Bulger and Stephen Flemmi ("The Rifleman"). The public was led to believe that Tim Connolly was merely a businessman and an innocent victim of one of Jim Bulger's many extortions. But in truth, Tim Connolly was secretly a "made member" of the Winter Hill gang and a high ranking lieutenant in this Boston crime family.
The Winter Hill Gang.
The Winter Hill gang, aka "The Irish Mob", is an Irish American crime family operating in the region of Boston, Massachusetts, dating back to the early 1960s. The Winter Hill gang was considered one of the most ruthless and violent white gangs in America. It operated for thirty years; running a portion of Boston's gambling rackets, drugs and did "brutal hits" for the Patriarca crime family (the New England Mafia), until its two leaders were indicted in January 1995.
Tim Connolly was an early protege of Stevie Flemmi, a renowned homicidal maniac of Italian descent. Beginning as a teenager in the mid 1970s, Connolly went to work for Flemmi, collecting gambling receipts and moving marijuana. Over the next decade, Connolly worked his way up from the bottom to the top spot below Bulger and Flemmi. From 1984 through 1994, Connolly operated several legitimate and illegitimate businesses which fronted for the Irish mob. In addition, Connolly ran his own criminal crew, which offered protection, loan sharking, gambling and drug distribution. Connolly was a close associate of both Flemmi and Bulger, having been seen with them on hundreds of occasions by Drug Enforcement Administration and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents performing surveillance. Connolly was one of only two lieutenants who met daily with Bulger and Flemmi. The other was Bulger's driver and bodyguard, Kevin Weeks.
Stevie Flemmi was arrested in Boston on January 5, 1995, one week prior to the release of a 37-count racketeering indictment against both he and Bulger. Flemmi has not been released from prison since. He is serving consecutive life sentences in a witness protection prison for his admitted participation in the murders of 10 people including two women. It is rumored that Flemmi committed over 50 murders himself and is responsible for the death of over 100 people, mostly career criminals.
Jim Bulger was tipped off by corrupt FBI agent John Connolly before the indictments came down and fled Boston. Since the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act indictments, Jim Bulger has also been charged with twenty murders. He has been a federal fugitive for thirteen years. He is the FBI's Most Wanted American fugitive and overall, second only to Osama bin Laden on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. There is a $2 million reward for information leading to the arrest of James "Whitey" Bulger.
Tim Connolly was shot in Boston's Chinatown neighborhood in an apparent assassination attempt in November 1994. Two weeks later, entering the Federal Courthouse on crutches, he provided crucial testimony to a grand jury that resulted in the racketeering indictments against Bulger and Flemmi. Connolly entered the Witness Protection Program in December 1994 but is rumored to have been "kicked out" within two years. He is believed to be "banned from Boston" as part of his deal with the United States Department of Justice. He has not been seen in Boston in over a decade. Unlike Winter Hill Associates Kevin Weeks, John "Red" Shea, Eddie Mackenzie and Pat Nee, Connolly has turned down several book deals and offers to be interviewed. He is rumored to be completing his life inside the Irish mob.
Who brought down Bulger and Flemmi?
After the 1995 indictments of Flemmi and Bulger, there was widespread speculation as to who was responsible for bringing down these mob bosses.
A front page "Boston Globe" article stated:
In 1997, it was publicly revealed that Jim Bulger and Stevie Flemmi were secret, Top Echelon FBI informants, ratting on the New England Mafia, while conducting murder and mayhem under the FBI's nose.
The ensuing FBI scandal, involving Bulger and Flemmi, has been called "one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement" and quite possibly "the biggest scandal in FBI history."
"Memos show that for more than twenty years, FBI headquarters in Washington D.C. knew that Boston agents were using hit men and mob leaders as informants and shielding them from prosecution for serious crimes, including murder."
As a result of this huge scandal, Tim Connolly was mostly forgotten on purpose. No one at the Department of Justice wanted to talk publicly about Bulger and Flemmi. Many of the Boston FBI agents involved in the Bulger and Flemmi case retired. Federal agents were forbidden to talk publicly about the case because of liability and potential obstruction of justice. But in 2003, the federal government quietly confirmed what had been rumored. Ex-FBI Special Agent (retired), John Gamel, Connolly's FBI handler and Supervisor of Organized Crime, appeared in front of a Congressional subcommittee and stated for the record:
Early life.
Connolly was born and raised in Roxbury, Massachusetts, USA, the hometown of Stevie Flemmi. He is the youngest of three children. His father is Irish-American and his mother is Italian (Sicilian). Like Flemmi and several other members of the Winter Hill, Connolly grew up in the Orchard Park projects, one of the first low-income housing projects in Boston. At age 12, Connolly's family moved over the city line into a working class section of Milton, a wealthy suburb of Boston. At age 15, Tim Connolly befriended a high school classmate, Billy Hussey, Stevie Flemmi's biological son. Connolly met "Stevie" and their relationship grew from there. Flemmi would ultimately become Connolly's mentor and boss for the next three decades.
Connolly graduated from Milton High School in 1976, where he was captain of the basketball team, earning all star honors. He attended Bridgeton Academy, Maine for a post graduate year. In September 1977 Connolly entered Boston College on a partial basketball scholarship. He quit before the season started. Connolly graduated from BC in 1981.
Criminal career.
In June 1976, Connolly joined up with Stevie Flemmi's "other gang", nicknamed "the Rox" for their hometown. He drove bales of marijuana in a U-Haul truck from south Florida to Boston under the guise of being a college student moving home. Connolly continued this practice throughout college, earning as much as $10,000 per load at the end, when they started adding cocaine to the mix. His criminal career as a drug trafficker was off and running. During college he ran a sports card gambling operation at ten colleges for Flemmi. He distributed "gaming cards" and collected cash from his dealers. By 1978 he was working as a bouncer at Flemmi's nightclubs. Then he started collecting debts for Flemmi's loan sharking business. A part-time job at a South Boston jewelry store put him in touch with Flemmi's partner, Jim Bulger, beginning in 1978.
Connolly was officially "made" into the Winter Hill gang in 1984. With Flemmi's backing, he purchased a South Boston bar called the Broadway Casino and renamed it Connolly's Corner Cafe. The 3C's, as it was known in Southie, would quickly become a Winter Hill gangster front and hangout, a place from which the Irish mob ran bookmaking, loan sharking and eventually cocaine. In 1985, Connolly bought into New Boston Mortgage, a legitimate Boston area mortgage broker. Here, he developed his expertise in creating fraudulent real estate loans for Winter Hill associates. From 1985 to 1994, Connolly ran a real estate rehabilitation business with Frankie "The Flame" Fraine, a renowned arsonist, insurance scam artist and Winter Hill associate. Together they used Bulger and Flemmi's contacts to renovate condemned properties and launder cash for the mob. According to DEA sources, Connolly was believed to have been "the bank", the financing arm for the South Boston cocaine ring, lending cash to associates who actually bought and distributed the drugs. This kept Bulger and Flemmi at a safe distance from the actual drug dealing activity but not far from the profits. Connolly laundered millions of dollars in drug and gambling proceeds through a variety of real estate and off-shore banking schemes. He was a millionaire before age 30.
A May 2001 "Boston Globe" expose on "Mobster Chronicles" referenced Tim Connolly as the real deal, a true gangster, unlike "Eddie Mackenzie, a wannabe gangster who was never part of Bulger's inner circle."
Globe writers Shelley Murphy and Judy Rakowsky state "Timothy Connolly, a former associate of Bulger and Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, said "I was down in the dirt with these guys. I know.""
Appearance.
Tim Connolly is a former basketball player, standing six foot six, with broad shoulders and a barrel chest. He has reddish blond, fine hair and a classic Italian nose.
History of violence.
Connolly’s business acumen was well known to people in South Boston, many of whom referred to him as “one of South Boston’s new millionaires.” Yet, Connolly’s brutal, violent side made him a perfect fit for the ruthless Irish mob. He had a reputation for having a “hair trigger” and pulling a gun without hesitation. He was well known for bare knuckles bar room brawling and gun violence. Much of his criminal record has been expunged but Connolly reputedly had over twenty “assault and battery” arrests.
Connolly was the subject of Massachusetts State Police, Boston Police and DEA investigations dating all the way back to 1977. His rap sheet lists a number of violent offenses ranging from Assault, Assault and Battery, Assault and Battery with a Dangerous Weapon including Pistol Whipping, Attempted Murder, Threatening a Witness and Extortion. In addition, he was charged with dozens of lesser offenses ranging from To Wit the Sped of Beasts (Running a Gambling Operation), Selling Stolen Merchandise and Drug Dealing. In almost all cases, the charges were dropped or dismissed without a finding. Connolly was a suspect in over twenty homicides in the Boston area but has never been officially charged with murder.
Connolly was considered a serious threat both inside and outside the Irish mob because of his large following, his contacts within the La Cosa Nostra (LCN) and his ability to pull people together from other gangs to form his own gang. Connolly is half Italian on his mother's side and has strong Sicilian roots. He has several cousins and relatives who were made men in La Cosa Nostra. One cousin was a highly respected LCN "banker" who wielded considerable power and influence throughout Boston. This "cousin" mentored Tim in real estate and other business. As a result, Connolly was known to have frequent contact with Frank Salemme.
In 1990, a 45-person Organized Crime Task Force was initiated by the DEA, Massachusetts State Police, FBI, Internal Revenue Service, Boston Police and U.S. Customs, with the goal of putting Connolly in jail. It was believed that his business operations were "the straw that linked all of Bulger and Flemmi's activities with the LCN." (La Cosa Nostra) As a result, Connolly was under 24 hour surveillance and the subject of numerous federal wiretaps.
An August 19, 1990 front page article from the "Boston Herald" titled "Feds taped alleged coke boss" referenced a phone conversation between John "Red" Shea and Tim Connolly, which was recorded by the DEA. The Herald article suggested that "Red" Shea was South Boston's coke boss but Connolly was much higher up in the Winter Hill than Shea or any other drug dealers. The taped conversation was about a questionable real estate loan which Connolly secured for South Boston drug dealer, Thomas Cahill, who was part of the South Boston narcotics distribution network.
Shea offered to "go down right now and tell him to shut his (expletive) mouth or I'll shut it permanently." Connolly said "that would be the nicest thing to do."
Red Shea was found guilty of cocaine dealing and served 12 years in prison. He was released in 2002.
Top echelon FBI informant.
Coincident with the South Boston cocaine indictments and the "Boston Herald" article, Tim Connolly received reliable information that he was being "setup by Bulger and Flemmi" with the DEA. As a result, Tim Connolly sought legal advice and counsel from private attorney Tom Reilly. Reilly was working in private practice while running his campaign for Middlesex County District Attorney. Later, as Middlesex DA, Reilly would aggressively prosecute both Bulger and Flemmi from 1991-1994. It was Tom Reilly who developed the legal strategy against Bulger and Flemmi that used bookmakers to help make the case under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Tom Reilly would eventually be elected Massachusetts Attorney General and served from 1999 to 2007.
After hearing Connolly's story, Reilly put him together with the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, A. John Pappalardo. After some legal wrangling and a grant of immunity, Connolly agreed to become a Top Echelon informant on Bulger and Flemmi. His Top Secret Operation was dubbed "Close Shave" or "Clean Shave" by his FBI handlers. They figured that Bulger would slit Connolly's throat if he ever found out he was wearing a wire and recording conversations. Connolly reportedly wore a wire for four years, gathering evidence, while the government's case was slowed by ex-FBI Agent John Connolly and corruption within the Boston FBI office.
The "Other Connolly".
Tim Connolly is not to be confused with corrupt ex-FBI Special Agent John Connolly, who shares the same spelling of their last name. John Connolly is accused of accepting $235,000 in cash and gifts from Bulger and Flemmi during the 1980s in return for providing them with tips and information on ongoing police and federal investigations. In addition, ex-Agent Connolly reputedly "fingered" Winter Hill associates and gang members, who were informing on Bulger and Flemmi. A number of known informants were murdered including Richie Castucci, Brian Halloran, John Callahan and John McIntyre.
According to court records, "in 1988 or 1989, (FBI) Agent John Connolly indirectly warned Stephen Flemmi through James Bulger that alleged extortion victim Timothy Connolly was cooperating with the FBI and would attempt to record conversations with Flemmi."
John Connolly was reportedly paid "ten grand" for this information on Tim Connolly. John Connolly is serving a ten year, 2002 federal prison sentence, for racketeering and obstruction of justice. John Connolly was indicted in May 2008 for the murder of John Callahan, a Miami gaming executive with ties to the Winter Hill. John Connolly is currently on trial for capital murder in Miami, Florida.
Tim Connolly didn't rat.
In the book "Paddy Whacked: The Untold Story of the Irish-American Gangster", the author mistakenly accuses Timothy Connolly of being "a rat."
In reality, it was Bulger and Flemmi who were "rats". They were setting up Tim Connolly with the DEA because they thought he was a major threat. They were willing to trade him (along with 50 associates who pled guilty to narcotics distribution) in return for a four year pass with the feds.
When the indictments came down against the Winter Hill, Connolly refused to testify against anyone other than Bulger and Flemmi. He put his life on the line for four years inside the Irish mob while the feds fumbled their case.
One ex-FBI agent who requested anonymity said this about Tim Connolly: "TC outfoxed the foxes. He got to them before they got to him. That takes balls and smarts."

Hagerstown Regional Airport

Hagerstown Regional Airport , also known as Richard A. Henson Field, is a county-owned public-use airport in Washington County, Maryland, United States. It is located four nautical miles (5 mi, 7 km) north of the central business district of Hagerstown, Maryland, about a half mile (800 m) from the Maryland/Pennsylvania border. The airport is in Western Maryland off Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11, not far from Northern Virginia, South Central Pennsylvania, and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.
According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 1,696 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 13,365 enplanements in 2009, and 10,665 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a "general aviation" airport based on 2008 enplanements (the "commercial service" category requires at least 2,500 per year).
History.
The airfield opened in 1928 on of farmland purchased by the Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company. It was purchased by the City of Hagerstown in 1933.
The facility was named Washington County Regional Airport in 1981, when ownership was transferred from the City of Hagerstown to Washington County. In 1998, the county renamed it Hagerstown Regional Airport - Richard A. Henson Field.
US Airways Express served Hagerstown Regional for quite some time. The last discontinued destination from HGR was Pittsburgh International Airport. Due to low ridership and an expired federal subsidy, the airline cancelled service in September 2007. The airport was without an airline for just over a year until the advent of Allegiant Air which ended its service in July 2010.
Allegiant Air flew from HGR to Orlando Sanford International Airport with two departures on Friday and two arrivals on Monday. The airline started commercial service on 14 November 2008. The airline used the McDonnell Douglas MD-82/MD-83 aircraft on this route. Scheduled service ended on July 19, 2010, but has since resumed. On August 13, 2013, Allegiant began a three–month hiatus from operations at Hagerstown Regional Airport. They will resume service on November 15, 2013 with afternoon flights.
In July and August 2011 the airport had service from Direct Air operated by Dynamic Airways to Lakeland, Florida and Myrtle Beach. Direct Air then identified Hagerstown as a seasonal market. Direct Air's decision was based on several contributing factors, these include, fuel costs; the number of advance ticket sales approaching the fall and winter months; the summer vacation season nearing an end, aircraft availability and the underlying tone of the economy which is indicating a slowing of leisure travel spending nationwide. Direct Air stated they planned on returning to the Hagerstown market in the spring of 2012. The charter carrier was subject to Chapter 7 liquidation on April 12, 2012.
On November 5, 2012, Sun Air International began offering daily flights to Washington-Dulles International Airport.

Carlos the Jackal

Ilich Ramírez Sánchez (; born October 12, 1949), also known as Carlos the Jackal, is a Venezuelan terrorist currently serving a life sentence in France for the 1975 murder of an informant for the French government and two French counter-intelligence agents. While in prison he was further convicted of attacks in France that killed 11 and injured 150 people and sentenced to an additional life term.
A committed Marxist-Leninist, Ramírez Sánchez is widely regarded as one of the most notorious political terrorists of his era. When he joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in 1970, recruiting officer Bassam Abu Sharif gave him the code name "Carlos" because of his South American roots. After several bungled bombings, Ramírez Sánchez achieved notoriety for the 1975 raid on the OPEC headquarters in Vienna, which killed three people. This was followed by a string of attacks against Western targets. For many years he was among the most wanted international fugitives. Carlos was dubbed "The Jackal" by "The Guardian" after one of its correspondents reportedly spotted Frederick Forsyth's 1971 novel "The Day of the Jackal" near some of the fugitive's belongings.
For his part, Ramírez Sánchez denied the 1975 killings, saying they were orchestrated by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, and condemning Israel as a terrorist nation. During his trial in France in 1997, he said, "When one wages war for 30 years, there is a lot of blood spilled—mine and others. But we never killed anyone for money, but for a cause—the liberation of Palestine."
Biography.
Early life.
Ramírez Sánchez, son of Marxist lawyer José Altagracia Ramírez-Navas and Elba Maria Sánchez, was born in Michelena, in the Venezuelan state of Táchira. Despite his mother's pleas to give their firstborn child a Christian first name, José called him Ilich, after Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, while two younger siblings were named "Lenin" (born 1951) and "Vladimir" (born 1958). Ilich attended a school in Caracas and joined the youth movement of the national communist party in 1959. After attending the Third Tricontinental Conference in January 1966 with his father, Ilich reportedly spent the summer at Camp Matanzas, a guerrilla warfare school run by the Cuban DGI near Havana. Later that year, his parents divorced.
His mother took the children to London, where she studied at Stafford House College in Kensington and the London School of Economics. In 1968, José tried to enroll Ilich and his brother at the Sorbonne in Paris, but eventually opted for the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow. According to the BBC, it was "a notorious hotbed for recruiting foreign communists to the Soviet Union" (see active measures). He was expelled from the university in 1970.
From Moscow Ramírez Sánchez travelled to Beirut, Lebanon, where he volunteered for the PFLP in July 1970. He was sent to a training camp for foreign volunteers of the PFLP on the outskirts of Amman, Jordan. On graduating, he studied at a finishing school, code-named H4 and staffed by Iraqi military, near the Syria-Iraq border.
PFLP.
On completing guerrilla training, Carlos (as he was now calling himself) played an active role for the PFLP in the north of Jordan during the Black September conflict of 1970, gaining a reputation as a fighter. After the organisation was pushed out of Jordan, he returned to Beirut. He was sent to be trained by Wadie Haddad. He eventually left the Middle East to attend courses at the Polytechnic of Central London (now known as the University of Westminster), and apparently continued to work for the PFLP.
In 1973, Carlos conducted a failed PFLP assassination attempt on Joseph Sieff, a Jewish businessman and vice president of the British Zionist Federation. On 30 December Carlos called on Sieff's home on Queen's Grove in St John's Wood and ordered the maid to take him to Sieff. Finding Sieff in the bathroom, in his bath, Carlos fired one bullet at Sieff from his Tokarev 7.62mm pistol, which bounced off Sieff just between his nose and upper lip and knocked him unconscious; the gun then jammed and Carlos fled.
The attack was announced as retaliation for Mossad's assassination in Paris of Mohamed Boudia, a PFLP leader.
Carlos admits responsibility for a failed bomb attack on the Bank Hapoalim in London and car bomb attacks on three French newspapers accused of pro-Israeli leanings. He claimed to be the grenade thrower at a Parisian restaurant in an attack that killed two and injured 30. He later participated in two failed rocket propelled grenade attacks on El Al airplanes at Orly Airport near Paris, on January 13 and 17, 1975.
On June 27, 1975, Carlos's PFLP contact, Lebanon-born Michel Moukharbal, who later turned out to be an agent for the Mossad, was captured and interrogated by the French domestic intelligence agency, the DST. When two unarmed agents of the DST interrogated Carlos at a Parisian house party, Moukharbal revealed Carlos's identity. Carlos then shot and killed the two agents and Moukharbal. Carlos fled the scene, and managed to escape via Brussels to Beirut.
OPEC raid and expulsion from PFLP.
From Beirut, Carlos participated in the planning for the attack on the headquarters of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) in Vienna. On December 21, 1975, he led the six-person team (which included Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann) that attacked the meeting of OPEC leaders; they took more than 60 hostages and killed three: an Austrian policeman, an Iraqi OPEC employee and a member of the Libyan delegation. Carlos demanded that the Austrian authorities read a communiqué about the Palestinian cause on Austrian radio and television networks every two hours. To avoid the threatened execution of a hostage every 15 minutes, the Austrian government agreed and the communiqué was broadcast as demanded.
On December 22, the government provided the PFLP and 42 hostages an airplane and flew them to Algiers, as demanded for the hostages' release. Ex-Royal Navy pilot Neville Atkinson, at that time the personal pilot for Libya's leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, flew Carlos and a number of others, including Hans-Joachim Klein, a supporter of the imprisoned Baader-Meinhof group and a member of the Revolutionary Cells, and Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann, from Algiers. Atkinson flew the DC-9 to Tripoli, where more hostages were freed, before he returned to Algiers. The last hostages were freed there and some of the terrorists were granted asylum.
In the years following the OPEC raid, Bassam Abu Sharif, another PLFP agent, and Klein claimed that Carlos had received a large sum of money for the safe release of the Arab hostages and had kept it for his personal use. Claims are that the amount was between US$20 million and US$50 million. The source of the money is also uncertain but, according to Klein, it was from "an Arab president". Carlos later told his lawyers that the money was paid by the Saudis on behalf of the Iranians and was "diverted en route and lost by the Revolution."
Carlos left Algeria for Libya and then Aden, where he attended a meeting of senior PFLP officials to justify his failure to execute two senior OPEC hostages – the finance minister of Iran, Jamshid Amuzgar, and the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Zaki Yamani. His trainer and PFLP-EO leader Wadie Haddad expelled Carlos for not shooting hostages when PFLP demands were not met, thus failing his mission.
After 1975.
In September 1976, Carlos was arrested, detained in Yugoslavia, and flown to Baghdad. He chose to settle in Aden, where he tried to found his own "Organization of Armed Struggle", composed of Syrian, Lebanese, and German rebels. He also connected with the Stasi, East Germany's secret police. They provided him with an office and safe houses in East Berlin, a support staff of 75, and a serviced car, and allowed him to carry a pistol while in public.
From here, Carlos is believed to have planned his attacks on several European targets, including that on the Radio Free Europe offices in Munich in February 1981. On February 16, 1982, two of the group—Swiss terrorist Bruno Breguet and Ramírez Sánchez's wife Magdalena Kopp—were arrested in Paris, in a car containing explosives. Following the arrest, a letter was sent to the French embassy in The Hague demanding their immediate liberation. Meanwhile, Carlos unsuccessfully lobbied the French government for their release.
In retaliation, France was struck by a spectacular wave of terrorist attacks, including : the bombing of the Paris-Toulouse TGV train on March 29, 1982 (5 dead, 77 injured); the car-bombing of the Libyan newspaper Al-Watan al-Arabi in Paris on April 22, 1982 (1 dead, 63 injured); the bombing of the Gare Saint-Charles in Marseille on December 31, 1983 (2 dead, 33 injured), and the bombing of the Marseille-Paris TGV train (3 dead, 12 injured) on the same day. In August 1983, he also attacked the Maison de France in West Berlin, killing one man and injuring twenty-two. Within days of the bombings, Carlos sent letters to three separate news agencies claiming responsibility for the bombings as revenge for a French air strike against a PFLP training camp in Lebanon the previous month.
Historians' examination of Stasi files, recently accessible after the German reunification, demonstrate a link between Ramírez Sánchez and the KGB, via the East German secret police. When Leonid Brezhnev visited West Germany in 1981, Ramírez Sánchez did not undertake any attacks, as the KGB had requested. Western intelligence had expected activity during this period. At one point, the Romanian Securitate hired Carlos to assassinate Romanian dissidents living in France.
With conditional support from the Iraqi regime and after the death of Haddad, Ramírez Sánchez offered the services of his group to the PFLP and other groups. His group's first attack may have been a failed rocket attack on the Superphénix French nuclear power station on January 18, 1982.
These attacks led to international pressure on East European states that harbored Ramírez Sánchez. For over two years, he lived in Hungary, in Budapest's second district known as the quarter of nobles. His main cut-out for some of his financial resources, such as Gaddafi or Dr. George Habash, was the friend of his sister, Dietmar Clodo, a known German terrorist and the leader of the Panther Brigade of the PFLP. Hungary expelled Ramírez Sánchez in late 1985, and he was refused sanctuary in Iraq, Libya and Cuba before he found limited support in Syria. He settled in Damascus with Kopp and their daughter, Elba Rosa.
The Syrian government forced Ramírez Sánchez to remain inactive, and he was subsequently seen as a neutralized threat. In 1990, the Iraqi government approached him for work, and, in September 1991, he was expelled from Syria, which had supported the American intervention in the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. After a short stay in Jordan, he was accorded protection in Sudan where he lived in Khartoum.
Western accounts long claimed Ramírez Sánchez as a KGB agent. Some attacks may have been attributed to him for lack of anyone else to claim credit. His own boasts about probably nonexistent missions have further confused the issue.
Arrest and imprisonment.
The French and US intelligence agencies offered a number of deals to the Sudanese authorities. Sudan cooperated. In 1994, Carlos was scheduled to undergo a minor testicular operation in a hospital in Sudan. Two days after the operation, Sudanese officials told him that he needed to be moved to a villa for protection from an assassination attempt and would be given personal bodyguards. One night later, the bodyguards went into his room while he slept, tranquilized and tied him, and took him from the villa.
On August 14, 1994, Sudan transferred him to French agents of the DST, who flew him to Paris for trial.
He was charged with the 1975 murders of the two Paris policemen and of Moukharbal and was sent to La Santé Prison to await trial. In 1996, a majority of the European Commission of Human Rights rejected his application related to the process of his capture.
The trial began on December 12, 1997 and ended on December 23, when he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He was later moved from La Santé to the Clairvaux Prison.
In 2001, after converting to Islam, Ramírez Sánchez married his lawyer, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, in a Muslim ceremony, although he was still married to his second wife.
In June, 2003, Carlos published a collection of writings from his jail cell. The book, whose title translates to "Revolutionary Islam", seeks to explain and defend violence in terms of class conflict. In the book, he voices support for Osama bin Laden and his attacks on the United States.
In 2005, the European Court of Human Rights heard a complaint from Ramírez Sánchez that his long years of solitary confinement constitute "inhuman and degrading treatment". Although the court rejected this claim, it was on appeal as of early 2006.
In a 2009 speech, Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez praised Ramírez Sánchez, saying he had been unfairly convicted and was not a terrorist but a "revolutionary fighter".
New trial.
In May 2007, anti-terrorism judge Jean-Louis Bruguière ordered a new trial for Ramírez Sánchez on charges relating to "killings and destruction of property using explosive substances" in France in 1982 and 1983. The bombings killed eleven and injured more than 100 people. Ramírez Sánchez denied any connection to the events in his 2011 trial, staging a nine-day hunger strike to protest his imprisonment conditions. The trial, which had been expected to last six weeks, began on November 7, 2011, in Paris. Three other members of Ramírez Sánchez's organization were tried "in absentia" at the same time: Johannes Weinrich, Christina Frohlich, and Ali Kamal Issawi. Germany has refused to extradite Weinrich and Frohlich, and Issawi, a Palestinian, "is reportedly on the run." Ramírez Sánchez continues to deny any involvement in the attacks. On December 15, 2011, Ramírez Sánchez, Weinrich and Issawi were convicted and sentenced to life in prison; Frohlich was acquitted.
Ramírez Sánchez appealed against the verdict and a new trial began in May 2013. He lost his appeal on 26 June 2013 and judges in a special anti-terrorism court upheld his life sentence.

Elwyn Tinklenberg

Elwyn "El" Tinklenberg (born February 26, 1950) is an American politician, and was the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nominee and Independence Party of Minnesota endorsee for U.S. Congress in Minnesota's 6th District elections in 2008. He announced his candidacy again in 2009 but dropped out almost immediately after candidate Maureen Reed raised nearly $250,000 in the first quarter of her campaign. He was also Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Transportation from 1998 to 2002.
Tinklenberg was born in Princeton and grew up on a farm in Pease, a small, Dutch farming community in central Minnesota. He earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Minnesota Duluth in 1973. Afterward, he enrolled at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois. He completed his Master of Divinity at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities in 1977. He served as a United Methodist minister in Blaine, Minnesota, from 1977 to 1986 before being elected to the Blaine City Council and then Mayor of Blaine. He was appointed Minnesota Transportation Commissioner by then Governor Jesse Ventura in 1998.
Offices held.
Blaine mayor.
In the 1980s, Tinklenberg was elected to the Blaine City Council, and in 1987, he was elected Mayor of Blaine and served in that position until 1996. Tinklenberg was a crucial player in the construction of the National Sports Center in Blaine, a multi-sport complex that includes a soccer stadium with a track, over 50 youth soccer fields, a golf course, a velodrome, a meeting and convention facility, and an eight-sheet ice rink, the Schwan Super Rink, which is the largest ice facility of its type in the world. The NSC hosts numerous national and international sporting events throughout the year, boosting the area's economy.
Minnesota Transportation Commissioner.
In 1991, Tinklenberg headed the North Metro Mayors Association, which worked to improve the transportation systems and business opportunities of its member communities. During that time, he gained a reputation as an expert of transportation and infrastructure issues, which led to his appointment as Transportation Commissioner by then Governor Jesse Ventura in 1998. In that role, Tinklenberg worked with Ventura to support aggressive construction and improvement of highways statewide. He worked with the Minnesota State Legislature to create bipartisan support for a regional commuter plan for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. This plan included the construction of the METRO Blue Line (the state's first light-rail line) and the Northstar commuter rail line.
In 2002, Tinklenberg oversaw the implementation of the Mn/DOT 511 service, an integrated internet and phone system for travel information. The 511 service is used by Minnesota travelers to receive information on conditions and amenities. According to Mn/DOT, it is 10 times faster than its predecessor.
After Tinklenberg announced his plans to leave Mn/DOT in 2002, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune published an editorial praising his record and service. The editorial noted that Tinklenberg told Minnesotans "not necessarily what they wanted to hear but what they needed to hear. His frequent explanations helped lift the interwoven issues of roads, transit, housing and development to the top of the state's agenda."
U.S. House campaigns.
Tinklenberg has been a candidate for the Minnesota's 6th congressional district twice: in 2006 he was a candidate, but was not nominated; and in 2008, he was nominated but lost the general election.
2006 campaign.
Tinklenberg was one of two DFL candidates for the sixth district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2006 election. A former United Methodist minister and manager of the Divisions of Public Services for Anoka County, he ran on a platform that supported jobs, education, transportation and as a socially conservative Democrat who opposed legalized abortion and supported a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage. He had been selected to receive support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and had received the early endorsement of several important labor unions.
Tinklenberg's opponent for the DFL nomination was Patty Wetterling. Another candidate, Scott Mortensen, dropped out of the running by March 2006. Tinklenberg originally entered the race only after receiving assurances from Wetterling, the DFL's 2004 candidate, that she would not run. Wetterling changed her mind after struggling to gain momentum in her campaign for the open Minnesota Senate seat and after getting encouraged by constituents who wanted a DFL alternative to Tinklenberg. On May 13, 2006, Tinklenberg dropped out of the race for Congress and endorsed Patty Wetterling after losing the DFL endorsement for the Sixth District race.
Michele Bachmann was the Republican candidate for the Minnesota Sixth District seat, which was vacated by Mark Kennedy so he could run for the U.S. Senate. The Minnesota Sixth District covers the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities and extends northwest across rural areas to include St. Cloud. Bachmann, the Republican nominee, won the election.
2008 campaign.
On September 28, 2007, Tinklenberg announced his plans to again challenge Bachmann for the seat in 2008, along with two other announced candidates, Bob Olson and Bob Hill. Following Tinklenberg's entrance into the race, Hill dropped out.
Tinklenberg received strong support from unions, receiving endorsements from all of the labor organizations that become involved in the election. Throughout the Senate District conventions in March and April, both Olson and Tinklenberg campaigns claimed having a lead in the delegate count.
Closer to the Sixth District DFL Convention, Olson's critiques of Tinklenberg grew sharper. Tinklenberg was accused of supporting the use of taconite tailings in transportation aggregate. Tinklenberg contended that, indeed, he did support the use of western Iron Range taconite tailings in transportation aggregate through a University of Minnesota Natural Resources Research Institute program, which was backed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The University's research concluded that taconite tailings from the western side of the Iron Range were safe for use in road construction, unlike the by-product from the eastern side of the Range, which had been linked to an increased risk to cancer. Tinklenberg reiterated that he would only support the sustainable use of western Iron Range taconite tailings as long as the research showed it to be a safe practice.
Tinklenberg was also accused by congressional opponents, including Bob Olson of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, of not complying with lobbying registration regulations. Through his work as a transportation consultant, Tinklenberg had been hired as an adviser to a number of counties and municipalities. Because his work required him to have contact with state legislators, Tinklenberg was required to register as a lobbyist in the state of Minnesota. On February 27, 2008, Eric Zaetsch, a local liberal blogger, filed a complaint with the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board. The Board found Tinklenberg to be in full compliance with the law.
On April 26, 2008, Tinklenberg received the endorsement of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (Minnesota's Democratic Party), garnering 72% of the delegate support on the first ballot — 12% above the required 60% threshold. Olson immediately withdrew, and Tinklenberg received the unanimous support of the Convention.
On the evening of October 17, 2008, Tinklenberg's opponent, Bachmann, appeared on "Hardball with Chris Matthews." She said she was "very concerned that may have anti-American views," and called for the news media to "do a penetrating expose" on "the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America?" Her statements about liberalism and anti-American views were quickly spread around liberal blogs such as The Daily Kos, Democratic Underground and The Huffington Post.
Outrage at Bachmann's comments led to nearly $440,000 in donations to Tinklenberg's campaign in less than 24 hours and over $750,000 in 72 hours. In response, Tinklenberg wrote, "The last few hours have been nothing short of astounding. Since Congresswoman Michele Bachmann appeared on MSNBC’s "Hardball" earlier tonight, there’s been a deluge of support unlike anything we have seen." His "total" fundraising before the Bachmann appearance was approximately $1 million, under $720,000 of which was from individuals. Prior to Bachmann's remarks, Democrats had already planned to spend $1,000,000 against the Republican incumbent after Tinklenberg had reached the milestone of raising $1,000,000 on his own.
Nevertheless, Bachmann won re-election, by just under 3 percentage points.
2010 campaign.
Although he had set up a website for a 2010 run for the seat, Tinklenberg announced that he had withdrawn from the race to allow the campaign against Bachmann to be conducted in a unified manner by DFL supporters.

Sin and Punishment

, is a Cabal shooter developed by Treasure and published by Nintendo. The game was released for the Nintendo 64 in Japan in 2000, and on the iQue Player in China in 2004.
Despite being a former Asia-exclusive release, it features extensive voice acting in English with subtitles in Japanese. As a result, it became one of the most requested Virtual Console titles in North America, with gaming site IGN declaring that there would be a "Very High" probability of its release after the initial announcement of the service.
"Sin and Punishment" was released on the Virtual Console in Japan on September 20, 2007, in PAL regions on September 28, 2007 and in North America on October 1, 2007. The PAL and North American releases feature further translation, with English menus in addition to the English voice acting and the Japanese subtitles, offset by a higher Wii Points price, 200 more points than normal. Previously, the game had been fan-translated to English by a small website called Vanit Studios. The game's success on Virtual Console prompted Nintendo to announce a sequel for the Wii titled "", which was released in 2009.
Gameplay.
The game is essentially a 3D Cabal-styled shooter with scrolling. Progress through the levels is automatic; the player's job is to aim and fire at enemies, sidestep, roll, jump, or double-jump to avoid attacks and obstacles.
The player can switch between manual (red targeting reticle) and lock-on (purple targeting reticle) firing modes at any time. Lock-on mode "sticks" the reticle to enemies, but is less damaging than manually aimed fire. The player can also attack using a powerful energy sword by tapping the fire button when enemies, or certain types of projectiles, are within close range. Projectiles struck in this manner are bounced back and can potentially inflict great damage on opponents. While the player attacks, a timer at the top of the screen counts down. When the timer hits 0, the player gradually loses more and more life until he or she either refills the timer or dies. Multiplayer involves two players controlling one character cooperatively. The second player controls the targeting sight and shoots while the first player controls the character's movement.
Plot.
Mankind's prosperity has led to a vast population increase and serious food shortages. In an attempt to solve the food shortage problem, scientists create a new species to use for food, and place the herd in northern Japan. In time, the creatures mutate and attack the people of Japan. An international peacekeeping organization called the Armed Volunteers tries to stop the creatures, now referred to as "ruffians", but they also oppress the Japanese.
Another group, referring to itself as the Savior Group and led by a mysterious woman named Achi, rises up to defend Japan against the Ruffians and Armed Volunteers.
The game begins in Tokyo with Achi, Airan, and Saki embarking on a mission to steal an Armed Volunteer transport. After fighting through waves of Volunteer troops, they gain a transport on top of a building, but as they do, they are attacked by ruffians. After fending them off, Saki is attacked by a telekinetic woman named Kachua. Saki knocks her off the building. As she falls, the city is flooded with blood, and Saki falls as well. He and Kachua are transformed into giant ruffians as they fall. Saki kills Kachua, then turns on Airan and Achi. Achi teleports herself and Airan to safety.
They find themselves on a Volunteer ship, commanded by Brad, leader of the Armed Volunteers. Brad commands the fleet to attack Saki, referring to him as The Beast. Airan and Achi fight their way through the ship until they encounter Brad and Leda, a smaller cat-like Ruffian. After a brief fight, Leda is killed, but Brad jumps on a fighter jet and escapes, then Achi uses her telekinesis to help Airan pursue him. In the end, they kill Brad and wipe out the Volunteer fleet, allowing them to focus on Saki.
Achi believes that she can return Saki to his human form, but she requires that Airan shoot him in the head to incapacitate him. After she angrily refuses, Achi creates an illusion of Airan on a ruffian-infested train, tricking Airan into shooting Saki. They are able to communicate with Saki, but then Achi reveals that the war with the ruffians and the Armed Volunteers is merely training for Saki to prepare for her coming global war. As Achi becomes more and more menacing, Saki regains consciousness and teleports himself and Airan away.
Airan wakes up on a ruffian-infested beach accompanied by Saki, who is now half ruffian, but otherwise back to normal. They fight their way to the safety of a small building; once there, Achi appears, takes Airan, and flees. When Saki catches up to Achi, she reveals that the reason for giving Brad and Saki some of her blood was because she needed one powerful warrior to help her rule over the new Earth she was about to create. Her intention is to reset the Earth by destroying the old one and creating a new one. Saki refuses and reverts to his full - Ruffian form. Achi creates the new Earth and begins her attack but Saki, along with Airan, destroy the new Earth, and Achi is sent drifting into space.
In the final scenes, Saki and Airan continue to travel around Earth to eliminate the Ruffians. Achi is seen drifting in space contemplating on the events that have passed. She then begins to show that she is impressed by Saki's powers, but wonders whether he can stand up to the true enemy - God.
Development.
"Sin and Punishment" was co-developed by Nintendo's Research & Development Department 1 and Treasure. During development, it was tentatively titled "Glass Soldier". The title was directed by Hideyuki Suganami, who also served as one of the programmers. Atsutomo Nakagawa, who had previously had a small part in developing "Radiant Silvergun" stepped up as program lead, and Yasushi Suzuki, another minor player from the "Radiant Silvergun" team took over as the lead character artist. This was the last game Suganami worked on before departing the company. He remained on friendly terms with Treasure, returning on a freelance/contractual basis to work on "Gunstar Super Heroes" as well as on the game's sequel for Nintendo Wii as a planner.
The title was not released until 2000, at which point the market for N64 games was badly weakened. Treasure quietly removed "Sin and Punishment" from its roster of upcoming North American and PAL releases, although there were plans to bring the game outside of Japan. The title was finally released to the public outside of Japan via the Wii's Virtual Console download system for the price of 1200 Wii Points. This version retains the Japanese subtitles with its English dialogue, but has translated menus and a few tutorials. The Virtual Console US/PAL version was translated by NST.
Reception.
"Sin and Punishment" received generally positive reception from Western critics upon its release. Gaming site IGN gave the title 9.0 out of 10, while GameSpot ranked the original Nintendo 64 version a 7.1 out of 10, citing a lack of difficulty modes (a factual error on their part) as a key complaint. A more recent GameSpot review of the Virtual Console version raised the rating to 8.0 out of 10. Retro Gamer magazine also listed it as top in its list of top 25 "run 'n gun" games.
In Japan, "Famitsu" magazine scored the game a 35 out of 40.
Legacy.
The protagonist Saki Amamiya later appeared in the Wii video game "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" as one of several Assist Trophies, which are items that summon characters from throughout Nintendo's history for a brief period of time. When summoned, Saki will jump around while slashing and blasting opponents with his Cannon Sword.
On October 2, 2008, "" was announced at a Nintendo press conference. It was developed for the Wii and was released in Japan on October 27, 2009, in Europe on May 7, 2010, and in North America on June 27, 2010.
This game features Saki and Arian's son, Isa Jo, a character who appeared in the original Sin and Punishment, albeit a grown up version of him.

Boris Dragojević

Boris Dragojević (Serbian Cyrilic: Борис Драгојевић) (born July 3, 1956 in Cetinje, Montenegro, Yugoslavia) graduated at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Belgrade. He studied painting in the class of Professor Mirjana Mihac and got his Masters degree at the Department of Painting in 1986.
Dragojević has been a member of the ULUS (Association of Visual Arts of Serbia) and free-lance artist since 1984.
Archeology Of Light.
Dragojevic belongs to a family of Mediterranean painters, a small assembly of brothers by sea. Among them are also Marko Murat, Emanuel Vidović, Pedja Milosavljević, Zvonimir Mihanović; and the younger ones are Momčilo Macanović and Saša Montilio. They are all painters of Mediterranean airs, the Southern sun, whose paintings have a scent of pines, cypresses and other plants growing by the sea. Perhaps that is why everything in his works is sanctified and lit, touched by spirit and miraculous. As if fire-flies are in the sea, and Locrum, Korčula and Our Lady of the Rocks become warm nests above the abyss.
Everything is humanized on Dragojevic's paintings, even the civilization chaos. Bay of Kotor is the center of the world, crystal of the sea and skies, and its immense depths are the birthplace and geography of dreams. Ships sail through the skies and underneath children play with delicate, colorful pebbles. Flanks in a marina of a forgotten old ship, crashed and washed out by numerous waves, a world in which a church is placed. In keeping with the ancient saying ""It is necessary to sail, it is not necessary to live"", every human being is a sailor. The painter is a Robinson who, like a novice, repents and atones for sins. He uses his brush to chase away evil, and his work wakes the spirit from eternal sleepiness. The painter is in collusion with eternity and sings it sweet canzones.
At the same time, Dragojević belongs to another family of painters. His opal colors, paintings that seem as if they were painted by precious lapis lasuli, transparent ultramarine, Prussian blue, cobalt from the bottom of the sea, invoke some of the dreadful, heavy, twilight beauty described in poems written by William Blake, Goethe and Rimbaud, and paintings by John Martin and Milovan Vidak. Dragojevic painfully lives his paintings. However, his works are not only Mediterranean and visionary. He uses his painting tools to move perspectives, bird's view becomes frog's view and scenes from the bottom are heavenly, according to the alchemical motto: "That which is above is like that which is below". In a way, those are holly paintings, a reply of gift to the challenges of the times of postmodern and post-technological utopia. He revealed how a painter doesn't have to be an icon painter to create sacral pieces, to respond to challenges of history, to make peace between Western and Eastern tradition, church and everyday life. Our Savior is at the bottom of the sea, because God is everywhere. Christ was crucified to atone for the sins of all living creatures, to relieve the earth and heavens. Scenes of crucifixion symbolize resurrection and baptizing by light. There are the first waters and heavens from the beginning of Genesis.
This artist brought a seldom found union of sharpness and poetics. He joined hyperrealism with the intimacy of Belgrade school, the precise figuration with discrete imagination. He sailed the seas of melancholy, but he didn't sink. He walked the deserted docks and beaches where a sense of being thrown into the world wakes from the very depths of human beings, where winds of doubt roar, yet everything is peaceful and in harmony. Isle of the Dead by Arnold Böcklin, under the intoxicating Mediterranean sun becomes the island of life. In the name of Dragojević's empire, it is best to remember Schopenhauer's advice ""Before wonderful paintings we should be silent and wait for them to address us first"" or Paul Valéry's thoughts ""When you write about art of painting, ask for its forgiveness"".
Seaside motifs.
Works of Boris Dragojević present him as an artist of hyperrealism, prone to shrewd surrealistic observation and obsessed with sea and underwater world, shores and monuments.
Dragojevic speculates, in a rather peculiar way, about life and its poetic text which follows his paintings in the catalogues. He claims: »Those propellers do not propel my submarine any more. There are too many wishes for the eyes of just one person«. These words vibrate deeper on the sight of quite extraordenary paintings »The Blue Korcula« (1999). It is a canvas full of blue light. Under the rays of imperceptible sunset, Korcula is shining, with its protruding red roofs; in the richly coloured blueness, the fish are floundering, trying to emerge to the surface, along with a big yellow turf of seaweed; from the other side comes a shoal of pink fish; dazzling surreal but familiar and warm sight, skillfully and patiently elaborated. The same mixture of undersea world, in some sense unreal, and real sea motifs – is the characteristic of other painters too.
In »Band under the false pearls«, over the group of singers the ensnared shells are glimmering, over »St George and Lady of Škrpjel«, the tiny clouds are twinkling and at the bottom a shoal of fish; in the corner, there is some kind of submarine (a motif seen in every painting: the artist's symbol for penetrating into impenetrable) whose prepellers are moving silently.
According to Rajko Vujisic, »the perceptible and sensual world of Dragojevic, the world over and under the sea, as well as his colouristic plays and opservations recommend him as a homomediteraneus« among the painters; Dragojevic in the peculiar but expected way of his, finds the universal note and balance in the varieties of his central message.
That is all Dragojevic's aesthtics and symbolism, somewhat strange but pure, mysterious but not at all morbid.
Mediterranean.
The central part of Dragojevic's artwork lies in his hereditary and post-hereditary experience combined with a brilliant creative ability. The first impression about his paintings is the exquisite technical knowledge. It is a very rare skill and leads to ultimate precision, the materialization and sensual quality of every single detail in his paintings. The seas, skies, stones, on-the-shore pulled out served barges. The artistic world of Boris Dragojevic lies in the mixture of real and surreal: he builds up some new visions of magic attraction. The recognizable motifs are taken from our very neighbourhood. The old buildings made of stone, Sveti Stefan, Perast, Our Lady of the Rocks(Gospa od Škrpjela), Sveti Đorđe Island, the temple of Bellavista...
Dragojevic enchants with his imagination, with painting by painting, turning upside down that real world, exchanging it for the world of fantasy. A newly cycle of his is but a new confirmation of his qualities and true Mediterranean sensibility.
Dilber.
In early 1990s, thanks to his collaboration with a French publishing house Les Humanoïdes Associés,
artist Boris Dragojevic launched into the world of comic book; the collaboration ended up after the outbreak of the war in 1991.
For the first time in Belgrade, we saw extracts from the first unfinished series of an alternative comic book Lieutenant Dilber(sailor).
That avant garde comic book is imbued with humour and vision, conjuring up the legacy of pop-art and, in a rather satirical manner, predicting the future events in ex-Yugoslavia. Although it has never been published, this comic book remains a rare and most precious artistic achievement of the murky years of last decade.

HM Prison Castington

HM Prison Castington is a male juvenile's prison and Young Offenders Institution, located in the village of Acklington in Northumberland, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.
Castington Prison is the most northerly Young Offenders Institution in England, and is built on the site of the former RAF Acklington airfield.
History.
Castington Prison was subject to a hostage crisis in 1997 when a prison officer was held hostage by two inmates for nineteen hours. At least two small fires were lit at the prison by inmates during the disturbance. Castington was involved in more controversy in 2001 when the Prison Reform Trust named it as the most violent detention centre in England. 
Various improvements to the regime and facilities at Castington were implemented over the next few years with positive results. In 2005 the prison was declared a safe, respectful and purposeful environment by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons.
In July 2011, it was announced that Castington along with several other publicly operated prisons, would be market tested, allowing private operators as well as HM Prison service, to tender for the contract to operate the prison.
The prison today.
Castington has the capacity to accommodate 128 sentenced and unsentenced juveniles (aged 15–17), 40 trainees (aged 15–17), as well as 120 sentenced and 120 unsentenced young offenders (aged 18–21). The prison is divided into seven units, all of which are equipped with integral sanitation.
The prison provides full-time education and vocational training geared towards GCSEs, GNVQs and City and Guilds qualifications for all inmates. Facilities at Castington include a library, fully equipped gym and sports pitches. In addition the prison's P.E. Department organise various sports teams and competitions. The prison chaplaincy includes eight members from various christian denominations as well as an imam.
Castington's Healthcare Centre has nursing cover 24 hours per day with seven in-patient beds and a Primary Care area. Outpatient facilities include a daily GP surgery with access to a dentist, optician, and podiatrist, as well as specialised mental health services.

Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)

 
Never Say Goodbye is a 1956 film starring Rock Hudson. The film is loosely based on the play "Come Prima Meglio Di Prima" by Luigi Pirandello.
Plot.
Dr. Mike Parker must leave California to speak at a conference in New York. A widower, he and daughter Suzy have a deal with each other to never actually say goodbye. She remains behind with Miss Tucker, her governess.
Having a drink after the conference, a caricature artist, Victor, comes to Mike's table along with a woman who plays piano at the nightclub, Dorian Kent. To their mutual shock, Mike recognizes Dorian as his late wife, Lisa.
Dorian flees into the street, where she is hit by a car. While he waits for her injuries to heal, Mike recalls how they met in Vienna, Austria in the postwar 1940s, when he was an Army doctor.
At that time, she and Victor had an act together as entertainers. Mike treated her for a sprained ankle and ended up marrying Lisa, who gave birth to Suzy. A jealous Mike, however, continually suspected her of having an affair with Victor, and when she went to the Russian sector to seek advice from her father, Lisa was never seen or heard from again.
Unwilling to renew their marriage but eager to see Suzy again, a recovered Lisa agrees to accompany Mike back to his home. The little girl misunderstands, however, believing her dad is bringing home a new wife. She becomes hysterical. And later, she takes a dislike to Lisa and refuses to believe any suggestion that this is her real mother.
Victor visits and charms Suzy with his drawings. Mike gets an inspiration that Suzy should describe to the artist whatever memories she has of what her mother looked like. Lisa is about to leave when Suzy, having seen Victor's sketch, realizes who she is and calls out to Lisa to come back.

<doc id="19654281" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19654281" title="Pangaea">
Pangaea

Pangaea ( ;) was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, forming approximately 300 million years ago. It began to break apart around 200 million years ago. The single global ocean which surrounded Pangaea is accordingly named Panthalassa.
The name Pangaea is derived from Ancient Greek "pan" (πᾶν) meaning "entire", and "Gaia" (Γαῖα) meaning "Mother Earth". The name was coined during a 1927 symposium discussing Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift. In his book "The Origin of Continents and Oceans" ("Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane"), first published in 1915, he postulated that prior to breaking up and drifting to their present locations, all the continents had at one time formed a single supercontinent which he called the ""Urkontinent"". Originally, this theory was rejected because the predominant theory was that the Earth was cooling and shrinking, with mountains being the last regions to shrink. Wegener's theory that mountains were made by two land masses colliding with each other seemed unlikely because it was thought that nothing could move a landmass as large as a continent. The name occurs in the 1920 and 1922 editions of "Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane", but only once, when Wegener refers to the ancient supercontinent as "the Pangaea of the Carboniferous".
Formation.
The forming of supercontinents and their breaking up appears to have been cyclical through Earth's history. There may have been several others before Pangaea. The fourth-last supercontinent, called Columbia or Nuna, appears to have assembled in the period 2.0–1.8 Ga. Columbia/Nuna broke up and the next supercontinent, Rodinia, formed from the accretion and assembly of its fragments. Rodinia lasted from about 1.1 billion years ago (Ga) until about 750 million years ago, but its exact configuration and geodynamic history are not nearly as well understood as those of the later supercontinents, Pannotia and Pangaea. 
When Rodinia broke up, it split into three pieces: the supercontinent of Proto-Laurasia, the supercontinent of Proto-Gondwana, and the smaller Congo craton. Proto-Laurasia and Proto-Gondwana were separated by the Proto-Tethys Ocean. Next Proto-Laurasia itself split apart to form the continents of Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica. Baltica moved to the east of Laurentia, and Siberia moved northeast of Laurentia. The splitting also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and Paleoasian Ocean. Most of the above masses coalesced again to form the relatively short-lived supercontinent of Pannotia. This supercontinent included large amounts of land near the poles and, near the equator, only a relatively small strip connecting the polar masses. Pannotia lasted until 540 Ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian period and then broke up, giving rise to the continents of Laurentia, Baltica, and the southern supercontinent of Gondwana.
In the Cambrian period, the continent of Laurentia, which would later become North America, sat on the equator, with three bordering oceans: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Iapetus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east. In the Earliest Ordovician, around 480 Ma, the microcontinent of Avalonia – a landmass incorporating fragments of what would become eastern Newfoundland, the southern British Isles, and parts of Belgium, northern France, Nova Scotia, New England, Iberia and northwest Africa – broke free from Gondwana and began its journey to Laurentia. Baltica, Laurentia, and Avalonia all came together by the end of the Ordovician to form a minor supercontinent called Euramerica or Laurussia, closing the Iapetus Ocean. The collision also resulted in the formation of the northern Appalachians. Siberia sat near Euramerica, with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents. While all this was happening, Gondwana drifted slowly towards the South Pole. This was the first step of the formation of Pangaea.
The second step in the formation of Pangaea was the collision of Gondwana with Euramerica. By Silurian time, 440 Ma, Baltica had already collided with Laurentia, forming Euramerica. Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, but as Avalonia inched towards Laurentia, the seaway between them, a remnant of the Iapetus Ocean, was slowly shrinking. Meanwhile, southern Europe broke off from Gondwana and began to move towards Euramerica across the newly formed Rheic Ocean. It collided with southern Baltica in the Devonian, though this microcontinent was an underwater plate. The Iapetus Ocean's sister ocean, the Khanty Ocean, shrank as an island arc from Siberia collided with eastern Baltica (now part of Euramerica). Behind this island arc was a new ocean, the Ural Ocean. 
By late Silurian time, North and South China split from Gondwana and started to head northward, shrinking the Proto-Tethys Ocean in their path and opening the new Paleo-Tethys Ocean to their south. In the Devonian Period, Gondwana itself headed towards Euramerica, causing the Rheic Ocean to shrink. In the Early Carboniferous, northwest Africa had touched the southeastern coast of Euramerica, creating the southern portion of the Appalachian Mountains, and the Meseta Mountains. South America moved northward to southern Euramerica, while the eastern portion of Gondwana (India, Antarctica and Australia) headed toward the South Pole from the equator. North and South China were on independent continents. The Kazakhstania microcontinent had collided with Siberia. (Siberia had been a separate continent for millions of years since the deformation of the supercontinent Pannotia in the Middle Carboniferous.)
Western Kazakhstania collided with Baltica in the Late Carboniferous, closing the Ural Ocean between them and the western Proto-Tethys in them (Uralian orogeny), causing the formation of not only the Ural Mountains but also the supercontinent of Laurasia. This was the last step of the formation of Pangaea. Meanwhile, South America had collided with southern Laurentia, closing the Rheic Ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains. By this time, Gondwana was positioned near the South Pole and glaciers were forming in Antarctica, India, Australia, southern Africa and South America. The North China block collided with Siberia by Late Carboniferous time, completely closing the Proto-Tethys Ocean. 
By Early Permian time, the Cimmerian plate split from Gondwana and headed towards Laurasia, thus closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, but forming a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean, in its southern end. Most of the landmasses were all in one. By the Triassic Period, Pangaea rotated a little and the Cimmerian plate was still travelling across the shrinking Paleo-Tethys, until the Middle Jurassic time. The Paleo-Tethys had closed from west to east, creating the Cimmerian Orogeny. Pangaea, which looked like a "C", with the new Tethys Ocean inside the "C", had rifted by the Middle Jurassic, and its deformation is explained below.
Evidence of existence.
Fossil evidence for Pangaea includes the presence of similar and identical species on continents that are now great distances apart. For example, fossils of the therapsid "Lystrosaurus" have been found in South Africa, India and Australia, alongside members of the "Glossopteris" flora, whose distribution would have ranged from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their present position; similarly, the freshwater reptile "Mesosaurus" has been found in only localized regions of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa. 
Additional evidence for Pangaea is found in the geology of adjacent continents, including matching geological trends between the eastern coast of South America and the western coast of Africa. The polar ice cap of the Carboniferous Period covered the southern end of Pangaea. Glacial deposits, specifically till, of the same age and structure are found on many separate continents which would have been together in the continent of Pangaea.
Paleomagnetic study of apparent polar wandering paths also support the theory of a supercontinent. Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; when rocks are formed, they take on the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles lie relative to the rock. Since the 
magnetic poles drift about the rotational pole with a period of only a few thousand years, measurements from numerous lavas spanning several thousand years are averaged to give an apparent mean polar position. Samples of sedimentary rock and intrusive igneous rock have magnetic orientations that are typically an average of these "secular variations" in the orientation of Magnetic North because their magnetic fields were not formed in an instant, as is the case in a cooling lava. Magnetic differences between sample groups whose age varies by millions of years is due to a combination of true polar wander and the drifting of continents. The true polar wander component is identical for all samples, and can be removed, leaving geologists with the portion of this motion that shows continental drift and can be used to help reconstruct earlier continental positions.
The continuity of mountain chains provides further evidence for Pangaea. One example of this is the Appalachian Mountains chain which extends from the southeastern United States to the Caledonides of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and Scandinavia.
Rifting and break-up.
There were three major phases in the break-up of Pangaea. The first phase began in the Early-Middle Jurassic (about 175 Ma), when Pangaea began to rift from the Tethys Ocean in the east to the Pacific in the west, ultimately giving rise to the supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana. The rifting that took place between North America and Africa produced multiple failed rifts. One rift resulted in a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean.
The Atlantic Ocean did not open uniformly; rifting began in the north-central Atlantic. The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous when Laurasia started to rotate clockwise and moved northward with North America to the north, and Eurasia to the south. The clockwise motion of Laurasia led to the closing of the Tethys Ocean. Meanwhile, on the other side of Africa and along the adjacent margins of east Africa, Antarctica and Madagascar, new rifts were forming that would not only lead to the formation of the southwestern Indian Ocean but also open up in the Cretaceous.
The second major phase in the break-up of Pangaea began in the Early Cretaceous (150–140 Ma), when the minor supercontinent of Gondwana separated into multiple continents (Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia). About 200 Ma, the continent of Cimmeria, as mentioned above (see "Formation of Pangaea"), collided with Eurasia. However, a subduction zone was forming, as soon as Cimmeria collided.
This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench. This trench might have subducted what is called the Tethyan mid-ocean ridge, a ridge responsible for the Tethys Ocean's expansion. It probably caused Africa, India and Australia to move northward. In the Early Cretaceous, Atlantica, today's South America and Africa, finally separated from eastern Gondwana (Antarctica, India and Australia), causing the opening of a "South Indian Ocean". In the Middle Cretaceous, Gondwana fragmented to open up the South Atlantic Ocean as South America started to move westward away from Africa. The South Atlantic did not develop uniformly; rather, it rifted from south to north.
Also, at the same time, Madagascar and India began to separate from Antarctica and moved northward, opening up the Indian Ocean. Madagascar and India separated from each other 100–90 Ma in the Late Cretaceous. India continued to move northward toward Eurasia at 15 centimeters (6 in) a year (a plate tectonic record), closing the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stopped and became locked to the African Plate. New Zealand, New Caledonia and the rest of Zealandia began to separate from Australia, moving eastward toward the Pacific and opening the Coral Sea and Tasman Sea.
The third major and final phase of the break-up of Pangaea occurred in the early Cenozoic (Paleocene to Oligocene). Laurasia split when North America/Greenland (also called Laurentia) broke free from Eurasia, opening the Norwegian Sea about 60–55 Ma. The Atlantic and Indian Oceans continued to expand, closing the Tethys Ocean.
Meanwhile, Australia split from Antarctica and moved rapidly northward, just as India had done more than 40 million years before. It is currently on a collision course with eastern Asia. Both Australia and India are currently moving northeast at 5–6 centimeters (2–3 in) a year. Antarctica has been near or at the South Pole since the formation of Pangaea about 280 Ma. India started to collide with Asia beginning about 35 Ma, forming the Himalayan orogeny, and also finally closing the Tethys Seaway; this collision continues today. The African Plate started to change directions, from west to northwest toward Europe, and South America began to move in a northward direction, separating it from Antarctica and allowing complete oceanic circulation around Antarctica for the first time. This motion, together with decreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, caused a rapid cooling of Antarctica and allowed glaciers to form. This glaciation eventually coalesced into the kilometers-thick ice sheets seen today. Other major events took place during the Cenozoic, including the opening of the Gulf of California, the uplift of the Alps, and the opening of the Sea of Japan. The break-up of Pangaea continues today in the Red Sea Rift and East African Rift.

Katie Green

Katie Green (born 28 August 1987) is an English model from Chichester, West Sussex. Her potential was initially recognised by a Surrey photographer who arranged a test-shoot for her at Image Park Studio in West Sussex, paving the way for her successful modelling career.
Green was originally signed to represent Wonderbra in July 2008, but Premier Model Management agency immediately pressured her to lose and two dress sizes. She ended her contract in October 28 when she refused to lose weight. She shortly afterward signed a contract to represent Ultimo which continued until October 2009 when Ultimo released her when she was photographed topless on a beach in violation of her contract. Green is unusual among models because of her height and weight and her refusal to lose weight to conform to the norms agencies expect of models. She initiated a campaign against size zero models. Green continues to model and has appeared in numerous publications and campaigns.
Personal life.
Katie Green (born 28 August 1987) is the youngest of four children. Her parents live in West Sussex, England. Green is tall and in May 2011 weighed . She was first given an opportunity to model when a Surrey, England photographer arranged a test-shoot for her at a photographic studio in West Sussex. She subsequently modelled for a group of photographers on a regular basis to gain experience. She was then introduced to a top London photographer for whom she began to regularly model. She applied for "FHM's" High Street Honeys competition in 2007, getting into the top 10 in 2008, but getting no further.
Some reports romantically linked Green to Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik for a period of time, though both said they are just "very good friends." They have been seen together in public a number of times in London, including "Reveal" magazine's fifth birthday party at Movida nightclub and a party for the 80th anniversary of the Durex contraceptive. As of August 2012, Green has been married to a Depot Manager with whom she is sharing a house with in Northampton.
Modelling contracts.
Green was a shopgirl in West Sussex making minimum wage in the summer of 2008 and considering applying to join the police force when she saw a magazine advertisement for a model to represent Wonderbra. She figured she didn't have a chance but attended an open casting in London in July 2008 and had a few quick pictures taken in her underwear. A week later, "The Daily Express" newspaper ran a picture of her on Page 3, asking readers to contact them if they knew who she was as she had been selected as the new face of Wonderbra. Green contacted the newspaper and soon learned she had beat out 4,000 other girls in the competition.
Wonderbra introduced her to Premier Model Management agency, who she signed with. She reported that "one the guys from the PR agency from Wonderbra" insisted that she lose weight, that it was normal for models to be a size 8... Unless I could drop down to that weight, they wouldn't be willing to get me more work." They arranged for two photo shoots with Wonderbra, and she appeared on billboards in London's west end and on the packaging for their D to G cup bras.
with the message, "D to G, because we’re more than a handful."
They agency insisted that she needed to lose and reduce her dress size from a UK size 12 to a UK size 8-10, she began to lose in eight days and got sick. She expected modelling work to start flooding in, but she said every time the agency called “it wasn’t with an offer of work, it was to check on my weight loss. I was invited back to London by Premier. I thought, ‘Great, this must be for a new photoshoot,’ but they just wanted to "measure" me to see how much weight I’d lost. I had to stand on scales then a tape measure came out to do all my vital statistics.” Her family contacted the agency about the demand that she lose weight, and were told, "We advised Katie that commercial and lingerie models need to be an average size 10 as is requested by the market sector she wanted to model for."
She described the pressure to lose weight in an interview in a national newspaper and announced her decision to quit modeling. She commented, "Had I lost the two stone, I would have looked like a bag of bones. I won’t sacrifice my health." Wonderbra denied asking her to lose weight, saying "...we chose her because of her fabulous curves. Since discovering Katie, we have been delighted with how she looked in our new D-G range." It said the agency had adviser her to lose weight, which they did not agree with.
Green was signed by the Unleashed PR agency and became the new face of Ultimo's D-G Range, alongside fellow model Melinda Messenger and Spice Girl Mel B. Michelle Mone, founder of Ultimo, commented, "I was appalled to hear that Katie had been told that she was too fat to model lingerie. She has an incredible shape and represents real women throughout the UK."
Asymmetrical breasts.
Green has been open about the fact that she had seriously asymmetrical breasts. When she went to the initial photo shoot, she was very self-conscious about her asymmetrical breasts. Her right breast was a B cup and and two cup sizes smaller than her left breast, a D cup. During the shoot they inserted a silicone rubber prosthetic to enhance her right breast. She said that as a teenager she felt "terribly self-conscious that I didn't measure up" when compared to popular models. "Back then, I didn't know the images were manipulated."
In January 2011, Green underwent a minimally invasive surgical procedure known as platelet injection fat transfer which transferred fat cells from both of her thighs to her right breast. She didn't want implants. "I didn't want breasts like footballs," she said. She chose the treatment not for her career but for her self-esteem. "Honestly, my chest was the one thing I disliked about my body. I did it for me. For the first time ever, I have matching breasts as well as thinner thighs."
Campaign against size zero models.
In July 2009, Green launched a campaign titled "Say No to Size Zero" against "size zero" models, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik. They began a petition drive with the goal to put an end to size zero and underweight models on the catwalk or working in the fashion industry. They set a goal to obtain 20,000 signatures and plan to present it to the UK Prime Minister and Parliament. They are campaigning for legislation that would require regular health checkups for all models before undertaking any assignments. Tabloid newspapers reported Green and Öpik were dating, suggestions they both denied.
Ultimo ends contract.
In September, 2009, Green was photographed topless on a beach. On September 26, 2009, Ultimo stopped representing Green, reputedly on the orders of founder Michelle Mone, when she broke the company's "no nudity" clause in her contract by being photographed topless while on holiday. Others report that she was let go because she was repeatedly photographed topless at various beaches.
MP Opik commented on Ultimo's dismissal of Green. "It’s a bit ironic if an industry which is entirely dependent on women’s breasts turns out to be embarrassed by a woman’s breasts." Mone responded, saying "I’m trying to run a global brand here and I’m not going to worry about wee girls like her." A friend noted that Green had "done topless modelling before and Ultimo knew that when they signed her." The friend also pointed out that Ultimo still represents Melinda Messenger, who is about Green's size, and that Jordan had worked for them as did Rachel Hunter, who posed naked for Playboy in 2004, before she signed with Ultimo.
Other work.
On 11 September 2009, Green raised £200,000 for various charities at the BGC Partners charity event in honour of employees who died during the September 11 attacks. Green joined Jonathan Ross, Sir Alex Ferguson, and Carol Vorderman at the event amongst others.
Green filmed a small cameo in the feature film "Get Him to the Greek". On 29 September, Green came third in a national poll conducted by "The Daily Star" to find the perfect celebrity body, beating the likes of Cheryl Cole, Mel B, and Victoria Beckham.
Green has appeared in numerous publications, such as "FHM", "OK! Magazine", and "The Sun". She was also voted one of the top 12 most inspirational women of 2008 by "Company" magazine.
She was asked to serve as a judge for "Love It" magazine’s modelling competition for size girls, "The Love It Lovelies".
Green launched "National Measure Your Bust Week" at Debenhams on Oxford Street in London during the spring of 2009 with Ultimo creator Michelle Mone.
Green was hired to represent Sony Bravia's new flat screen TV, which is the world's thinnest of its kind. They advertised the screen with the slogan, "Even TVs are feeling the pressure to be thin." Green has also signed an advertising deal with a water brand for a TV campaign. Green appeared as a soccerette in the programme Soccer AM at the end of 2009. She is a Celtic FC fan.

City of Chicago v. Morales

City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41 (1999), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a law cannot be so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence can not figure out what is innocent activity and what is illegal.
Background.
Under the common law, loitering was a crime.
The facts of the case were:
More specifically, "In 1993, Jesus Morales was arrested and found guilty under the ordinance for loitering in a Chicago neighborhood after he ignored police orders to disperse. Ultimately, after Morales challenged his arrest, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the ordinance violated due process of law in that it is impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties." The United States Supreme Court affirmed the Supreme Court of Illinois' judgment.
Issue and holding.
The only issue on "certiorari" was whether the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, either on its face or as applied, in violation of "the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."
The United States Supreme Court held in this case that a law can not be so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence can not figure out what is innocent activity and what is illegal.
Rationale.
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the plurality, said that the:
Six justices ultimately sided with Morales, and three with the City of Chicago. However, only three justices agreed on all of the rationales and the complete holding, namely Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg. O'Connor, Kennedy, and Breyer had concurring opinions. One particular "sticking point" was whether "It is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement ... and infringes on constitutionally protected rights..." Only Stevens, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg, could agree on that.
Impact.
The ACLU claimed a win in this case. There is a question as to whether the First Amendment "won" in the case.

Civil enforcement officer

A civil enforcement officer (CEO or colloquially traffic warden) is a person employed to enforce parking, traffic and other restrictions and laws in England & Wales. In England, they are employed by county councils, London Borough Councils, metropolitan district councils or Transport for London, and in Wales by county (borough) councils - or private companies contracted by any of the above. Until the passage of the Traffic Management Act 2004, on-street parking and traffic movement violations were enforced by non-warranted police traffic wardens employed by constabularies. Off-street parking violations were enforced by parking attendants employed by local authorities and private companies.
Powers.
Civil enforcement officers may only exercise their functions when wearing a uniform authorised by the Secretary of State. They may issue Penalty Charge Notices for numerous offences, either via a hand-held device or CCTV. They may inspect and confiscate blue badges. They may interview motorists suspected of disabled badge fraud under caution. They may immobilise vehicles. Penalty charge notices are not criminal proceedings, and failure to pay will result in certificated bailiffs serving warrants of execution. They may issue penalties for several moving violations, among them driving in bus lanes, executing prohibited turns and driving the wrong way on a one way system. They may penalize for failure to display valid road tax. Increasingly civil enforcement officers employed by some authorities issue fixed penalties for non-traffic offences using the Community Protection scheme of the Police Reform Act 2002. This range of offences include environmental crime such as fly-tipping and spitting, as well as anti-social behaviour like noise violations and truancy, in addition to issuing tickets for parking and traffic violations.

<doc id="19654300" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19654300" title="Civilian enforcement officer">
Civilian enforcement officer

Civilian enforcement officers (CEOs) are either employees or authorised officers of Her Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service and are responsible for enforcing magistrates court orders. They can seize and sell goods to recover money owed under a fine and community penalty notice. They also execute, in England & Wales, warrants of arrest, committal, detention and distraint (also called "distress"). Members of approved enforcement agencies have the same powers as civilian enforcement officers, but are employed by private companies. Both are referred to as 'authorised officers' in law.
Civilian enforcement officers.
"Civilian enforcement officer", in relation to a warrant, means a person who:
Approved enforcement agencies.
The Lord Chancellor may approve persons or bodies for the purpose of executing warrants pursuant to section 125B of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. The Lord Chancellor must maintain a register containing the names of all persons and bodies approved by him and must make such arrangements as he considers appropriate for making the register available for inspection. A decision by the Lord Chancellor to revoke the approval of a person or body does not have effect to revoke the approval until the Lord Chancellor has informed the person or body of the decision.
Powers.
The powers of 'authorised officers' derive from the Magistrates' Courts Act. Authorised officers are:
The powers of authorised officers extend to all of England & Wales.
They may execute any warrant of arrest, commitment, detention or distress issued by a justice of the peace:
The power to make orders above shall be exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
Where a warrant has been executed by a civilian enforcement officer, a written statement indicating:
shall, on the demand of the person arrested, committed or detained or against whom distress is levied, be shown to him as soon as practicable.
Where a warrant has been executed by an authorised officer who is not a civilian enforcement officer, a written statement indicating:
shall, on the demand of the person arrested, committed or detained or against whom distress is levied, be shown to him as soon as practicable.
Entry to execute a warrant of arrest, commitment or detention.
An authorised officer may enter and search any premises for the purpose of executing a warrant of arrest, commitment or detention issued in proceedings for or in connection with any criminal offence.
The power may be exercised only to the extent that it is reasonably required for that purpose; and only if the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the person whom he is seeking is on the premises. In relation to premises consisting of two or more separate dwellings, the power is limited to entering and searching any parts of the premises which the occupiers of any dwelling comprised in the premises use in common with the occupiers of any other such dwelling; and any such dwelling in which the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the person whom he is seeking may be.
Entry to levy distress.
An authorised officer may enter and search any premises for the purpose of executing a warrant of distress issued under section 76 of the Magistrates' Courts Act for default in paying a sum adjudged to be paid by a conviction. The power may be exercised only to the extent that it is reasonably required for that purpose.
Searching arrested persons.
This applies where a person is arrested in pursuance of a warrant of arrest, commitment or detention issued in proceedings for or in connection with any criminal offence. An authorised officer may search the arrested person, if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested person may present a danger to himself or others. An authorised officer may also search the arrested person for anything which he might use to assist him to escape from lawful custody, but only if the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested person may have concealed on him anything of a kind mentioned in that sub-paragraph; and only to the extent that it is reasonably required for the purpose of discovering any such thing.
The powers conferred by this paragraph to search a person are not to be read as authorising the officer to require a person to remove any of his clothing in public other than an outer coat, a jacket or gloves; but they do authorise the search of a person’s mouth.
An officer searching a person may seize and retain anything he finds, if the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the person searched might use it to cause physical injury to himself or to any other person, or the person might use it to assist him to escape from lawful custody.
An authorised officer may use reasonable force, if necessary, in the exercise of his powers of arrest, entry and search.

Bonnie Bluh

Bonnie Bluh (March 29, 1926 – October 2, 2008), born Helen Celia Bluh, was a Jewish-American feminist novelist and essayist.
Biography.
Helen Celia Bluh was born March 29, 1926 in New York City, to Morris Bluh and Mary Steinberg.
Bluh, as friends and family knew her, was brought up in Sunnyside, Queens, a neighborhood that has repeatedly appeared in her novels. 
Bonnie Bluh made her first appearance as a singer at the age of three on the "Hearns Radio Children's Hour". As she always liked to recount, she wrote her first play when she was 7 years old and set it in Africa, writing all the dialogue in a made up language. It was staged at P.S. 150, the first New York progressive school she was attending and starred her fellow students.
At the age of 14, while working in the Borscht Belt, she changed her name from Helen to Bonnie, because she had decided she needed a better name to fit her new career as a singer.
She married in 1946 and four years later she and her husband Max Lowy moved to California, where Bluh immediately became involved with the Pasadena Playhouse acting in various productions, including "A Streetcar Named Desire", as well as trying her hand at directing.
In the 1960s, living in New Jersey, she joined The New Dramatists in New York City and assisted many Broadway directors including Jules Irving at what was then the brand new Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center (1965–1973).
Before their divorce, in 1969, Max and Bonnie (as she was still known at the time) raised three sons: Craig, Kenn, and Brian.
In the 1960s she lived in Philadelphia where she was on the local National Organization for Women speakers bureau and formed one of the earliest Consciousness raising groups. Consciousness Raising groups consisted of women, without the interference of men, discussing and analyzing their lives, sharing their problems with each other and, more importantly, understanding these shared problems rose from society's systematic oppression of women.
In 1971 Bluh left for Europe to write a book. The result was "Woman to Woman" (1974), her non-fiction account of the emergence of the European feminist movement. Bluh was the first American feminist to meet with the feminists of Ireland, England, Holland, France, Italy and Spain.
When her agent was unable to get the book published because it was considered too personal and too angry, Bluh founded Starogubski Press and published the book herself. "Woman to Woman" is considered a "landmark account of the second wave of feminism", a book that has been used in the classrooms of over 60 colleges.
Her next book, was the novel, "Banana" (1976). The publisher, Macmillan, promoted the novel as "the raunchiest, funniest story ever written by a woman." Though many reviewers (almost all male) at the time found it too angry, one female reviewer commented, "This is a novel with a raised consciousness, a mature, intelligent novel of real talent and excitement Doubting Thomases have claimed the feminist movement has yet to produce. Bonnie Bluh, herself an actress-playwright-singer-dancer, has done it."
"Banana" was quickly followed by another non-fiction book, "The Old Speak Out" (1979), published by Horizon Press, which was an account of aging in America. As one reviewer wrote, "This extraordinary confrontation between one gutsy woman and a lot of other people amounts to so much more than a series of interviews. Because of Bonnie Bluh we can reach into places most of us don’t attempt in person, risking little and finding a hundred new friends."
Through the 1970s she wrote everything from articles about feminism to movie reviews for various weeklies including "The Soho News" and "N.Y. Women's Weekly". She was also a guest on various radio and TV shows and conducted writing seminars in New York City, as well as Stockholm, Moscow and Tel Aviv.
In 1985, Bluh had moved to the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village. In a building filled with artists of all stripes she was known as one of the more outgoing, colorful characters.
After a string of agents had trouble finding a publisher for her next novels, Bluh picked what she considered the most popular of the lot and once again chose the self-publishing route. "The Eleanor Roosevelt Girls" (1998), a saga of female friendship and betrayal, follows six Sunnyside, Queens girls from 1942 to 92. It was perhaps less incendiary than her earlier work, or perhaps the times had just changed.
"Bonnie Bluh's very readable "The Eleanor Roosevelt Girls" is the perfect antidote for all those years of watching women on the screen stand helplessly by during the big fight scenes. You know, the ones where you want to shout ‘Pick up the stick and hit the guy!’ Bluh's women do just that, and more."
In the first years of the 21st century Bluh, who never gave up her love of theater, edited, along with the New Dramatists Alumni Committee, "Broadway's Fabulous Fifties" (2002).
Bluh had finished her untitled memoir just before her death. It is a book about the approach of death; her death. Far from being a morose account of decline and frailty in old age, it was an eccentric, comical late-in-life Bildungsroman including hilarious versions of her own obituary.
Bibliography.
"Woman To Woman" (Starogubski Press, 1974, ISBN 978-0-9603234-0-1)
In 1971 she traveled to Europe intending to finish her novel "Banana". She was invited to the Irish Parliament, which sent her in search of Irish feminists. After meeting them she continued her search in England, France, Holland, Italy, and Spain. Bluh was "the first American feminist to meet with women in Ireland, Italy, and Spain and was on the first abortion march held in Rome in 1971." She was forced to go underground with the Spanish feminists. The result of this year in Europe led to the book "Woman to Woman", which has been used in over fifty woman's studies programs.
In her review in "Majority Report" Kit Kennedy wrote, "Rarely has the print media lent itself to such a high level of consciousness raising... "Woman to Woman", a seemingly quiet book, may be the first book on honest politics." Karen Lindsey in the "Boston Herald American" wrote, "By its warm, personal and probing nature, "Woman to Woman" does much to reaffirm the existence of an international sisterhood of women." 
"Banana"
Bluh's first novel, "Banana", was well received and was reissued in 2000 by iUniverse under the auspices of the Authors Guild. The novel relates the story of Joanna, a woman who could have done anything, but married Jay, became a homemaker, and in her mid-forties realized she wanted something more. A critic for "Publishers Weekly" wrote, "You bleed for Joanna, but most of all you believe in her. This is a novel with a raised consciousness, a mature, intelligent novel of real talent and excitement Doubting Thomases have claimed the feminist movement has yet to produce. Bonnie Bluh, herself an actress-playwright-singer-dancer, has done it." Lynda Schor added in Ms. Magazine that "What makes "Banana" exceptional and fascinating is its inventiveness, its verve, originality, its sometimes sheer madness, its rage. Preposterousness and eccentricity woven into the mundane. The result is as colorful and variegated as a Peruvian scarf... the most scintillating dialogue I've come across in a long time." In her review in the San Francisco Chronicle Elizabeth Pomada added that the novel's "high velocity monologue is raucous, dirty-truthful, and chortlingly funny." Budicki for the Voice News wrote, "A 'torrent of consciousness' sweeping before it all the modern jargon and confused issues of today... includes a cast of sixteen people. This reviewer groaned when she saw them listed on the jacket, but couldn't lay the book down after starting, having practically to prop her eyes open with fingers, to finish reading at three a.m."

Consilia

Consilia (plural of "consilium", "advice") is a genre of book, originating in medieval era plagues, where practical advice is given on a medical or other philosophical subject.
Origin.
The format was originated by the Florentine doctor of medicine Taddeo Alderotti, under the pressures for down-to-earth advice, based on experiential observations, in treating the Black Death that decimated Italy in 1348 and recurred at generational intervals for the following centuries. A "consilium" was a doctor's written text in response to a particular case, where the malady had been determined; in the "consilium" the medical doctor identified the disease and prescribed the appropriate treatment. The accumulation of "consilia" circulated in manuscript began, for the first time in Europe, to lay down a "corpus" of medical practice, case-by-case. 
Medieval medical writings had tended towards theory rather than praxis, which was denigrated as "ars mechanica", mere technician's work unsuited to the higher intellect. Characteristically they took the form of glosses and commentaries on the received texts of Antiquity, of Galen and Dioscurides, with nods towards Aristotle and the shadow of Hippocrates. Medicine was more closely allied in these with philosophy rather than with therapy and prevention; however with the onset of plague, practical experience moved to the forefront of concern.
Alderotti, who practiced and taught in Tuscany and the north of Italy, and served as doctor to Pope Boniface VIII, was a formative figure in the development of the faculty of arts and medicine at the University of Bologna. His more than a hundred "consilia" based on his clinical observation of actual cases formed the prototypes of a new genre of literature.
Format.
"Consilia" followed a conventional format. The first section recorded the examination of the patient, detailing the patient's age, sex, social station, occupation and place of residence. and a list of the patient's symptoms, which served to identify the malady. A second section prescribed a dietary regime that was to be followed. A final section prescribed specific medications and dosage, with the other interventions available at the time: bleeding, bathing, cauterisation, fumigation.
The "Consilia" of Gentile da Foligno (died 1348, most probably of the plague) were among the first medical texts to be printed, in the 1470s.

Minesweeper (video game)

Minesweeper is a single-player video game. The object of the game is to clear an abstract minefield without detonating a mine. The game has been written for many system platforms in use today.
Overview.
The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares. Some randomly selected squares, unknown to the player, are designated to contain mines. Typically, the size of the grid and the number of mines are set in advance by the user, either by entering the numbers or selecting from defined skill levels depending on the implementation. The grid size is often user-selectable as a way to adjust the difficulty level.
The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square. If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank. The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine.
In some versions, a question mark may be placed in an unrevealed square to serve as an aid to logical deduction. Implementations may also allow players to quickly "clear around" a revealed square once the correct number of mines have been flagged around it. The game is won when all mine-free squares are revealed, because all mines have been located.
Some versions of Minesweeper will set up the board by never placing a mine on the first square revealed, or by arranging the board so that the solution does not require guessing. Minesweeper for versions of Windows protects the first square revealed; in Windows 7, players may elect to replay a board, in which case the first square may no longer be protected.
History.
Minesweeper has its origins in the earliest mainframe games of the 1960s and 1970s. The earliest ancestor of Minesweeper was Jerimac Ratliff's "Cube". The basic gameplay style became a popular segment of the puzzle game genre during the 1980s, with such titles as "Mined-Out" (Quicksilva, 1983), "Yomp" (Virgin Interactive, 1983), and "Cube". Cube was succeeded by "Relentless Logic" (or "RLogic" for short), by Conway, Hong, and Smith, available for MS-DOS as early as 1985; the player took the role of a private in the United States Marine Corps, delivering an important message to the U.S. Command Center. "RLogic" had greater similarity to "Minesweeper" than to "Cube" in concept, but a number of differences exist:
The gameplay mechanics of Minesweeper are included in a variety of other software titles, including:
Distribution and variants.
Versions of Minesweeper are frequently bundled with operating systems and GUIs, including Minesweeper for OS/2, Minesweeper in Windows, KMines in KDE (Unix-like OSes), Gnomine in GNOME and MineHunt in Palm OS. Many clones can be found on the Internet.
Variants of the basic game generally have differently shaped minefields, in either two and three dimensions, and may have more than one mine per cell. For example, X11-based XBomb adds triangular and hexagonal grids, and Professional Minesweeper for Windows includes these and others.
A minigame in "FIFA 11" is a variation of Minesweeper.
The Voltorb Flip game in the non-Japanese releases of "Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver" is a variation of Minesweeper and Picross.
Another derivative of Minesweeper is Tentaizu, which could be described as a Minesweeper with some squares initially revealed, where the player doesn't reveal any squares, only mark them, and whose objective is to mark all mines correctly. Tentaizu puzzles usually have a unique solution.
Computational complexity.
In 2000, Richard Kaye published a proof that it is NP-complete to determine whether a given grid of uncovered, correctly flagged, and unknown squares, the labels of the foremost also given, has an arrangement of mines for which it is possible within the rules of the game. The argument is constructive, a method to quickly convert any Boolean circuit into such a grid that is possible if and only if the circuit is satisfiable; membership in NP is established by using the arrangement of mines as a certificate. If, however, a minesweeper board is already guaranteed to be consistent, solving it is not known to be NP-complete, but interestingly it has been proven to be co-NP-complete.
Measuring board difficulty.
The difficulty of a given minesweeper board is often measured using the "3BV" measure (stands for Bechtel's Board Benchmark Value).
Method.
The 3BV of a board is the total count of:
For example, in the illustrated example, there is one opening (shown by white borders) and there are seven further numbered squares (green dots), giving a 3BV rating of 8. Equivalently, it is the minimum number of single clicks required in typical implementations to reveal all of the mine-free squares.
3BV/s.
3BV/s stands for 3BV per second.
Because the time that is needed to finish a Minesweeper board depends highly on the difficulty of the board, it may not be the best way to compare records. 3BV/s on the other hand does consider the difficulty of the Minesweeper board as well as the time needed to finish it. Among the best Minesweeper players, 3BV/s records are not nearly as important as time records, but they give a picture of how fast someone can play with regard to mouse-handling.
If flags are marked, it is possible to require fewer clicks than the 3BV of the respective board. Using only left clicks is called non-flagging (nf) whereas marking mines with right-clicks is called flagging-style.
Criticism.
Created by Ubisoft In 2001, the Italian "International Campaign to Ban Winmine" voiced strong concern over the game, contending that it is an "offense against the victims of the mines" and those who risk their lives to clear them. They created their own "Winflower" game, and lobbied Microsoft to use it in place of Minesweeper in Windows 98. As a reaction to this criticism, the version of Minesweeper included in Windows Vista and Windows 7 offers a mode in which the mines are replaced with flowers.

In 2003 Butlers Chocolates relocated to Clonshaugh, Dublin 17 and in the same year were awarded the Brand Marketing Award from Bord Bia in the Irish Food and Drink Industry Awards.
From 2006 to the present day Butlers have developed new products, launching their first organic chocolate range, dark chocolate selection, 200g Chocolate cube range, Butlers Chocolate Café ice cream as well as Take Home Ice Cream amongst others. Also in collaboration, Butlers Chocolates launched a range of chocolates with Irish Fashion designer, Orla Kiely.
Butler Chocolates, now over 75 years old, is still based in Dublin and Mrs Bailey-Butler's original recipes and chocolate making techniques have been handed down to the present generation.
The company was the proud recipient of the Frontier Award Supplier of the year in 2009, for excellence in supply to duty-free markets.
Butlers Chocolate Cafes.
Butlers opened their first café in Dublin in 1998 and since then, they have opened a further 15 Butlers Chocolate Cafés – in Dublin, Cork, Galway, New Zealand, Karachi, Lahore, Pakistan and Westfield, London. In late 2010, Butlers opened their 15th Café at their headquarters in Clonshaugh, Dublin 17.
Butler's do not plan to franchise in Ireland or the UK, however their expansion plans internationally, excluding the UK, will be by means of the franchise model.

William Hacket Pain

Brigadier-General Sir George William Hacket Pain KBE CB (5 February 1855 – 14 February 1924) was a British Army officer and Royal Irish Constabulary commissioner. He played a key part in setting up the Ulster Volunteers as a unionist militia during the Home Rule crisis of 1912, and was believed to have organised gun-running. At the outbreak of the First World War he served in command of a Brigade of the Ulster Division and commanding British forces in the north of Ireland. He served briefly as a Unionist Member of Parliament.
Early career.
Hacket Pain joined the British Army in 1875, initially serving part-time in the Royal Wiltshire Militia, and in October of that year as a Lieutenant of Militia he passed the qualifying examination of the Civil Service Commissioners. He received his first commission in regular army on 20 November, as a Lieutenant in the 102nd Foot, and then joined the 2nd Regiment of Foot (Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)) on 18 December 1875.
Sudan.
From 1888, Hacket Pain served in the Sudan during the Mahdist War as a Captain in the West Surreys. He took part in the action at Fort Gamaizah (near Suakin), and served with the Nile Frontier Force in 1889 winning the Order of Medjidie Third Class. In February 1891 he was present at the capture of Tokar, in command of a battalion of Egyptian infantry; his horse was shot from under him. At the end of the war, he was awarded the Order of Osmanieh Third Class which he was given a Royal Licence to wear on his British uniform.
Colonial Africa.
On 15 May 1894 Captain Hacket Pain became a Major, transferring from the Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment to the Worcestershire Regiment. He accompanied the expedition to Dongola in 1896, taking part in the operations of 7 June (in which his horse was again shot) and 19 September; on 3 November 1896 he was mentioned in despatches.
In 1896 Hacket Pain was promoted from Major to Lieutenant-Colonel. He was still employed with the Egyptian Army, and served in Egypt with the Nile Expedition as an Acting Adjutant-General of the Egyptian Army at their base from 1896 to 1898. On 27 December 1898, he married Saidie Merton, an Australian, at Cairo. Hacket Pain's wife was from a Jewish family and in 1908 she unsuccessfully challenged her grandfather's will which gave her the proceeds of the investment of £1,500 but provided that it would be cut off should she marry outside the Jewish faith.
South African war.
Hacket Pain served in South Africa throughout the South African War of 1899-1902. He was in command of the 2nd Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment from 12 February 1900 to 31 May 1902, and was Commander of Troops at Rietfontein from October to December 1900. During the war he took part in operations in Colesberg in January and February 1900, in Lindley on 26 June, Bethlehem on 6–7 July, and Wittebergen throughout July. He was again mentioned in despatches on 10 September 1901. Hacket Pain was honoured for his service by being made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 27 September 1901, and on 10 December 1901 he was promoted as a Brevet Colonel.
Back in Britain, his promotion to full Colonel was confirmed on 23 February 1907, and in 1908 he was placed in command of the South Midland district, in which post he served for three years. He was put on half pay on 21 April 1911, and left the Army on Retired Pay on 5 February 1912.
Ulster Volunteers.
Hacket Pain's retirement from the Army coincided with preparations in the north of Ireland for active resistance to Home Rule. At the beginning of 1912 many Unionists had offered their services and begun drilling with dummy rifles, which were considered ridiculous by their political opponents. According to Timothy Bowman's history, Hacket Pain was among a select group of senior officers specifically recruited by the Unionist establishment. His appointment as Chief of Staff to Lieutenant-General Sir George Richardson, the General Officer Commanding of the Volunteers was announced in September 1913. Hacket Pain was English and a member of the Church of England.
Under Hacket Pain's guidance, the Volunteers were organised and trained in military effectiveness. He insisted, however, that Volunteer units should use their own ranks rather than traditional British Army ones, and reprimanded units which failed to follow this approach. Hacket Pain was fully supportive of the Ulster Volunteers' political agenda, and made a political speech at a smoking concert for a section of the East Belfast Regiment in Ballynafeigh in August 1914.
Larne Gun Running.
Just as the Ulster Volunteers knew they needed armaments, the British authorities were keen to stop them from landing guns on Irish shores. At the end of March 1914, just as the Ulster Volunteers were readying for an imminent civil war, a Norwegian steamer called "Fanny" was filled full of 35,000 rifles from Germany, and gave its destination as "Öreland" (sic). Two English-speaking people were said to be on board. The owners of the ship insisted that the destination was in fact South America, and some connected the cargo with the Mexican Revolution, but on 25 April the "Fanny" (disguised as the "Mountjoy") landed its cargo at Larne, Bangor and Donaghadee having outwitted Customs. The Ulster Volunteers had been given a general mobilisation order on Friday 24 April and made sure that all roads leading to the disembarking centres had been blocked and that key telephone wires had been cut. 500 cars were used to distribute the rifles.
According to his obituary in "The Times", Hacket Pain "was always believed to have planned and carried out" this operation. Timothy Bowman's history notes that Hacket Pain was given the credit but that Fred Crawford, who organised the shipment, regarded him as a 'dove' in the ruling councils of the Volunteers. However it is known that Hacket Pain wrote to Crawford in January 1914 asking for a statement of the arms which Crawford had already imported, and requesting Crawford to undertake further gun-running if authorised by Edward Carson. After their safe landing, he issued a memorandum instructing all units that "in the event of any attempt being made to seize arms, etc. ... intimation will be given to the officers in charge of the Constabulary that their armed attempt will be promptly and firmly resisted."
First World War.
Ulster Volunteers preparations for civil war were short-cut by the outbreak of the First World War. Hacket Pain re-enlisted in the British Army, and raised the 108th Infantry Brigade (part of the 36th (Ulster) Division) by recruiting the Ulster Volunteers. The Army welcomed the fact that the Volunteers were trained and armed, and Hacket Pain was appointed on 4 September to command the 108th Infantry Brigade in France. After two years he transferred back to Ireland to command the Northern Ireland district, where he served for three years.
As Chief Military Officer he faced the opening of the Irish War of Independence; in August 1919 he prohibited an Irish Nationalist procession from marching on the city walls of Derry, fearing that grave disorders would occur. However Hacket Pain sometimes resisted pressure. In January 1919 Dawson Bates wrote to Sir James Craig telling him that Hacket Pain was reluctant to bring out troops against Sinn Féin-inspired strikes in Belfast, or to do anything that might make the workers think they were being intimidated, despite pressure from people Bates described as "scare-mongers".
Irish war of independence.
On 1 November 1919 he retired from the Army again with the rank of Brigadier-General, and received the award of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. However, he was immediately re-employed as Divisional Commander of the Royal Irish Constabulary in Belfast. Nationalist MP Joseph Devlin complained that this meant the Chief of Staff in Carson's army was responsible for protecting Roman Catholics. After riots and the murder of an RIC District Inspector in Lisburn, Hacket Pain put the town under military control in August 1920. Hacket Pain was reported to have resigned in early November 1920.
Member of Parliament.
On 18 January 1922, Hacket Pain was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament at Westminster for South Londonderry. His election came after the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had provided for a reduction of the number of Members of Parliament representing Ireland, which made it unlikely that Hacket Pain would have a long Parliamentary career. He made his maiden, and only, speech on 10 May 1922 in support of the Constabulary (Ireland) Bill. Hacket Pain served on the Standing Committee examining the Bill.
Death.
Retiring at the general election in October 1922, Hacket Pain lived at the United Services Club in Pall Mall for a short time. In October 1923 he was taken ill and became a patient at King Edward VII Convalescent Home for Officers at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. He died there on 14 February 1924, and was buried at Whippingham on 18 February.

Resun AG (an acronym from the French "REmplacement SUisse Nucléaire", Swiss nuclear replacement) is a company located in Aarau (Switzerland). Its purpose is to manage the construction of two new nuclear reactors. These are unofficially known as Beznau 3 and Mühleberg 2 from the locations where they should be built.
After 2020 the existing plants of Beznau (1969, 730 MW) and Mühleberg (1972, 355 MW) should cease activity. At the same time some import contracts with France for around 2000 MW will expire. With a combined electrical power output of 3200 MW, the new reactors would prevent the resulting energy gap and satisfy the expected domestic demand increase.

Financial Supervisory Authority (Iceland)

The Financial Supervisory Authority () is the single supervisory authority for the financial sector in Iceland. Companies regulated by the authority are commercial banks, savings banks, insurance companies, insurance brokers, credit institutions (investment banks and credit card companies), securities firms, securities brokers, mutual funds and pension funds management companies and other entities authorized to receive deposits. The current CEO is Ms. Unnur Gunnarsdóttir, who succeeded the controversial Gunnar T. Andersen in March 2012. Deputy CEO Ragnar Haflidason succeeded Jónas Fr Jónsson in October 2008 and Gunnar T Andersen took over as CEO in April 2009. The first CEO was Pall Gunnar Palsson, who directed from 1999 to 2005.
History.
The FME was established in 1999, under the authority of two acts of legislation, act number 87/1998 on the Official Supervision of Financial Operations and act number 99/1999 on the Payment of Cost Due to the Official Supervision of Financial Activities.
FME and the Icelandic financial crisis 2008.
During the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis Jónas Fr Jónsson was the CEO of the FME, both he and the FME were heavily criticized for missing the warning signs and inaction leading up to and during the crisis. The FME played an important role during the crises in late 2008 when the main three Icelandic banks failed:
On October 6, 2008 it was announced that the FME would be given significant additional powers over Icelandic financial institutions by the Icelandic government. Included the power to take over the running of Icelandic banks without actually nationalising them. Immediately the following morning it intervened in the operations of Landsbanki and Glitnir, taking over their operations within Iceland. 
On 9 October, Kaupthing was placed into receivership by the FME, following the resignation of the entire board of directors. The bank said that it was in technical default on its loan agreements after its UK subsidiary had been placed into administration.
On 25 January 2009, Björgvin G. Sigurðsson, Iceland's Commerce Minister, resigned citing the pressures of the nation's economic collapse, as the country's political leaders failed to agree on how to lead country out of its financial crisis. One of his last acts as minister was to dismiss Jónas Fr Jónsson the director of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA). He was subsequently replaced by Deputy CEO Ragnar Haflidason.

Washington State Guard

The Washington State Guard (WSG) is an all-volunteer state defense force for the U.S. state of Washington. It is the third element of the military forces in the Washington Military Department: the Washington Army National Guard, the Washington Air National Guard and State Guard. While the Army and Air Guard, forming part of the Washington National Guard, can be mobilized to federal service, the WSG is only utilized within Washington and is never deployed out of state.
History.
The Washington State Guard (WSG) traces its history back to 1855 when the Washington Territorial legislature enacted the first law creating the organized militia. After Washington became a state it created its state militia in 1890. The Washington State Militia served in the Philippines during the Spanish American War of 1898–1899. The Washington State Militia was exclusively under state control until 1903 when the Washington National Guard was formed and placed under both federal and state control.
During World War I the exclusively state controlled Washington State Guard was reborn. The Third Infantry Regiment consisting of 16 companies, a medical detachment, and a machine gun company was formed in principal cities throughout Washington. After World War I the WSG was disbanded.
On 1 November 1940, over a year before the U.S. entered World War II, the Washington State Guard was again re-established with an Infantry Brigade and two Regiments. During World War II the WSG was used to guard vital installations and to patrol the coast lines. As an invasion of the U.S. mainland became less apparent, the role shifted to disaster assistance and civil defense. In 1947 the WSG was again disbanded.
On 19 May 1960 Governor Albert Rosellini once more re-established the Washington State Guard to augment the Washington National Guard as an additional internal security force for the State and to replace the Washington National Guard when the latter is inducted into active federal service. The WSG has been serving continuously since then supporting the Washington Military Department in a variety of missions and assignments.
Current composition.
The Washington State Guard consists of two brigades. The First Infantry Brigade is located at the Seattle Armory and maintains two battalions in Olympia and Everett. The Second Infantry Brigade is located in Spokane. The WSG HQ is located at Camp Murray in Tacoma, Washington. State Guard soldiers drill in a non-pay status one day a month and two days during the summer. However, WSG soldiers can and have been called up to paid state active duty to support the Washington Military Department in a variety of missions within the state. They have been deployed to the State Emergency Operation Center and many County Emergency Operation Centers to coordinate National Guard resource request to state/federally declared disasters. State Guard members may resign their enlistment or commission at any time, unless mobilized or in paid state active duty status. Most WSG soldiers have served in the military, but some come straight from civilian life.
Despite the terms (e.g. "brigade" and "battalion") used for the units comprising the State Guard, actual personnel strength is cadre only, meaning that while a skeleton organization exists, for real-world deployment the organization would have to be filled by the "calling out" of the unorganized militia of the state by the Governor.
State laws governing the Washington State Guard.
State Constitution.

Paul Toth

Paul Louis Toth (June 30, 1935 – March 20, 1999) was an American professional baseball player. A right-handed pitcher, he appeared in Major League Baseball from to for the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. He was born in McRoberts, Kentucky, grew up in Youngstown, Ohio and was listed at and .
Toth was part of the "Brock for Broglio" trade on June 15, 1964: he accompanied outfielder Lou Brock and left-handed relief pitcher Jack Spring in a trade to the Cardinals, in exchange for starting pitcher Ernie Broglio, left-handed relief pitcher Bobby Shantz and outfielder Doug Clemens. Brock went on to help lead the Cardinals to three National League championships and two World Series titles — including one in 1964 — and setting a new career record for stolen bases. Toth, who was pitching at Triple-A for the Cubs at the time of the trade, remained in the minor leagues for the rest of his career.
The Brock trade returned Toth to his original organization. He began his professional career in the Cardinals' farm system in 1955, and made his major league debut with the Redbirds in 1962, pitching in six games, including one start, sandwiched around service with the Triple-A Atlanta Crackers. On September 1, 1962, he was traded to the Cubs for pitcher Harvey Branch, and made six more appearances for the Cubs, including four starts, before the 1962 campaign ended, with Toth winning four of five decisions and posting an earned run average of 4.62. Toth then spent the entire season on the Cub roster, appearing in 27 games played, 14 as a starter, and compiling a 3.10 ERA with two shutouts. Toth was ineffective in two May 1964 starts and was sent to the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League after only four total games in Chicago.
He remained in Triple-A for the rest of his active career, retiring after the 1967 baseball season. In 43 Major League games, Toth pitched 192 innings and gave up 177 hits and 54 bases on balls with 82 strikeouts. In retirement, he became a resident of Erie, Michigan. He died in Anaheim, California, of a heart attack during a family visit at the age of 63. Toth is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.

Sunshine (UK TV series)

Sunshine is a three-part comedy drama that began on 7 October 2008 on BBC1 from the co-writers of "The Royle Family" and "Early Doors". These co-writers, Craig Cash and Phil Mealey, also appear in the series.
Plot.
Bob 'Bing' Crosby played by actor Steve Coogan has always been popular with friends and others around his area but he has a gambling problem, meaning he cannot resist the temptation to bet on horse races.
Bernadette (Lisa Millett) is Bob's childhood friend who became his lover and is now the mother of their son Joe, played by actor Dominic Senior. While she has often been angered by her husband's casual gambling habits, she has always forgiven him. When Bob bets more money and the stakes are raised, he could lose everything, including the wife and son he loves.
At the end of the first episode, he bets his family's Disneyland fund on a 'dead cert' and loses it all. Bernadette kicks him out of the house, and he goes to sleep in the box room at his father's house.
Bernadette and Joe move to a flat due to the reduced living costs - they are unable to afford a house because of Bing's absence. Joe begins to save up to buy his father a television.
However, Bing steals this money to gamble. He returns home, and is confronted by his father. Bing reveals that he was unable to do it and returns the money. He admits that he has a gambling problem.
Reception.
Sam Wollaston reviewed the first episode for "The Guardian" liked Coogan's lead performance saying "once you get used to him being a charming idiot rather than a comic genius, he's actually pretty good at it: acting, I mean." However, he was unsure of what the drama "was": "I've gone from chuckling gently - maybe a bit too gently - to weeping. Not proper wailing, just sniffing a bit. And that I think is the problem, we've gone from snug comedy to gritty northern drama. Kind of - because it's neither one thing nor t'other, as they say up there." Nancy Banks-Smith looked at the last episode for the same paper, and suggested "Bernard Hill gave a simply magnificent performance as the dying grandfather in Sunshine (BBC1), against some formidable scene-stealers.".
"The Independent" noted "the writers have a good ear for inadvertent, glancing comedy" and concluded "it’s possible to believe that these people are real enough to care about, and real enough to feel some pain." in their review.
Ian Semel, the head of gambling addiction helpline Gambling Therapy, thought "Sunshine" was "a fantastic illustration of the archetypal problem gambler" and that he was "going to get all my counsellors to watch it."

Attachment-based therapy (children)

Attachment-based therapy is a phrase intended to apply to interventions or approaches based on attachment theory, originated by John Bowlby. These range from individual therapeutic approaches to public health programs to interventions specifically designed for foster carers. Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of socioemotional development with one of the broadest, deepest research lines in modern psychology, attachment theory has, until recently, been less clinically applied than theories with far less empirical support. This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the pseudo-scientific interventions misleadingly known as attachment therapy. The approaches set out below are examples of recent clinical applications of attachment theory by mainstream attachment theorists and clinicians and are aimed at infants or children who have developed or are at risk of developing less desirable, insecure attachment styles or an attachment disorder.
Individual Therapeutic Approaches.
Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP).
This intervention was developed from "infant-parent psychotherapy", a psychoanalytic approach to treating disturbed infant-parent relationships based on the theory that disturbances are manifestations of unresolved conflicts in the parent's past relationships. The "patient" is the infant-parent relationship. Infant-parent psychotherapy was expanded by Alicia Lieberman and colleagues into Child-Parent Psychotherapy, a manualized intervention for impoverished and traumatised families with children under the age of 5. In addition to the focus on the parents early relationships the intervention also addresses current life stresses and cultural values. CPP is supported by five randomized trials showing efficacy in increasing attachment security, maternal empathy and goal-corrected partnerships. The trials also showed a reduction in avoidance, resistance and anger. The therapy is delivered through unstructured weekly sessions involving both parent/s and child over the course of a year. The trials were conducted with low income groups, maltreating families, families with depressed mothers and families where children were exposed to domestic violence.
'Circle of Security'.
This is a prevention program using parent education and psychotherapy intervention developed by Glen Cooper, Kent Hoffman, Robert Marvin, and Bert Powell designed to shift problematic or 'at risk' patterns of attachment – caregiving interactions to a more appropriate developmental pathway. It is stated that it is explicitly based on contemporary attachment and congruent developmental theories. Its core constructs are Ainsworth’s ideas of a Secure Base and a Haven of Safety (Ainsworth et al. 1978). The aim of the protocol is to present these ideas to the parents in a user-friendly, common-sense fashion that they can understand both cognitively and emotionally. This is done by a graphic representation of the child's needs and attachment system in circle form, summarising the child's needs and the safe haven provided by the caregiver. The protocol has so far been aimed at and tested on preschoolers up to the age of 4 years.
The aim of the therapy is:
Its four core principles are: that the quality of the child parent attachment plays a significant role in the life trajectory of the child; that lasting change results from parents changing their caregiving patterns rather than by learning techniques to manage their childs behaviors; that parents relationship capacities are best enhanced if they themselves are operating within a secure base relationship; and that interventions designed to enhance the quality of child-parent attachments will be especially effective if they are focused on the caregiver and based on the strengths and difficulties of each caregiver/child dyad.
There is an initial assessment which utilises the 'Strange Situation' procedure, (Ainsworth 1978), observations, a videotaped interview using the Parent Development Interview (Aber et al. 1989) and the Adult Attachment Interview (George et al. 1984) and caregiver questionnaires regarding the child. The childs attachment pattern is classified using either Ainsworth or the PAC (Preschool Attachment Classification System). The therapy is then 'individualized' according to each dyads attachment/caregiver pattern. The programme, which takes place weekly over 20 weeks, consists of group sessions, video feedback vignettes and psycho-educational and therapeutic discussions. Caregivers learn, understand and then practice observational and inferential skills regarding their children's attachment behaviors and their own caregiving responses.
Circle of Security is being field tested within the 'Head Start'/'Early Head Start' programme in the USA. According to the developers the goal of the project is to develop a theory- and evidence-based intervention protocol that can be used in a partnership between professionals trained in scientifically based attachment procedures, and appropriately trained community-based practitioners. It is reported that preliminary results of data analysis of 75 dyads suggest a significant shift from disordered to ordered patterns, and increases in classifications of secure attachment. The process of validation is not yet completed.
Dyadic developmental psychotherapy.
This is an approach originally developed for the treatment of adopted and foster children and trauma. It is an approach grounded in attachment theory and is evidence-supported. There have been two empirical studies supporting its efficacy The published professional literature on Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy includes several professional treatment manuals and empirical studies including the following:
The Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn and Juffer meta analysis (2003).
This was an attempt to collect and synthesise the data to try to come to "evidence based" conclusions on the best intervention practices for attachment in infants. There were four hypotheses:
The selection criteria were very broad, intending to include as many intervention studies as possible. Sensitivity findings were based on 81 studies involving 7,636 families. Attachment security involved 29 studies and 1,503 participants. Assessment measures used were the Ainsworth sensitivity rating, Ainsworth et al. (1974), the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment, Caldwell and Bradley (1984), the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale, Barnard et al. (1998) the Erickson rating scale for maternal sensitivity and supportiveness, Egeland et al. (1990).
The conclusion was that "Interventions with an exclusively behavioural focus on maternal sensitivity appear to be most effective not only in enhancing maternal sensitivity but also in promoting children's attachment security." p212.
Three studies were singled out by Prior and Glaser to illustrate intervention processes which have shown good results. p239-244.
"Watch, wait and wonder". Cohen et al. (1999).
This intervention involved mothers and infants referred for a community health service. Presenting problems included feeding, sleeping, behavioural regulation, maternal depression and feelings of failure in bonding or attachment. The randomly assigned control group undertook psychodynamic psychotherapy.
The primary work is between mother and therapist. It is based on the notion of the infant as initiator in infant-parent psychotherapy. For half the session the mother gets down on the floor with the infant, observes it and interacts only on the infant's initiative. The idea is that it increases the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible. Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother. For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.
Infants in the watch, wait and wonder group were significantly more likely to shift to a secure or organised attachment classification than infants in the psychodynamic psychotherapy group although there was no differential treatment effect in maternal sensitivity. It has been pointed out however that specific caregiver responses to attachment (the precursors to secure attachments) were not measured.
"Manipulation of sensitive responsiveness", van den Boom (1994), (The Leiden Programs).
This intervention focused on low socio-economic group mothers with irritable infants, assessed on a behavioural scale. The randomly assigned group received 3 treatment sessions, between the ages of 6 and 9 months, based on maternal responsiveness to negative and positive infant cues. Intervention was based on Ainsworth's sensitive responsiveness components, namely perceiving a signal, interpreting it correctly, selecting an appropriate response and implementing the response effectively.
It was found that these infants scored significantly higher than the control infants on sociability, self soothing and reduced crying. All maternal components improved. Further, a 'strange situation' assessment carried out at 12 months showed only 38% classified as insecure compared to 78% in the control group.
Follow ups at 18, 24 and 42 months using Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scales, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, the Child Behaviour Checklist (Achenbach) and the Attachment Q-sort showed enduring significant effects in secure attachment classification, maternal sensitivity, fewer behaviour problems, and positive peer relationships.
"Modified Interaction Guidance" Benoit et al. (2001).
This intervention aimed to reduce inappropriate caregiver behaviours as measured on the AMBIANCE (atypical maternal behaviour instrument for assessment and classification). Such inappropriate behaviours are thought to contribute to disorganized attachment. The play focused intervention (MIG) was compared with a behaviour modification interventio focused on feeding. A significant decrease in inappropriate maternal behaviours and disrupted communication was found in the MIG group.
Feedback methods.
Video-Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting (VIPP).
Developed and evaluated by Juffer, Bakermans-Kranenburg and van Ijzendoorn, this collection of interventions aim to promote maternal sensitivity through the review of taped infant-parent interactions and written materials. The programme can also be expanded to include the parents internal working models (VIPP-R) and/or sensitive disciplinary practices (VIPP-SD). Findings from randomized controlled trials are mixed but overall supportive of efficacy, particularly for "highly reactive infants" and in reducing later externalising behaviours. The various versions show promise but research continues.
Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES).
Developed by Daniel Schechter and colleagues. They developed an experimental paradigm informed by attachment theory called the Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions to test whether traumatized mothers, who often suffered psychological sequalae from a history of abuse and violence, could "change their mind" about their young children. The technique used was to watch video-excerpts of play, separation and similarly stressful moments in the presence of a clinician who asks the mother to think about what she (and her child) might be thinking and feeling at the time of the excerpt and at the moment of videofeedback. It applies the principles of mentalization as an aide to emotional regulation with these traumatized parents. It also involves elements of prolonged exposure treatment, the video-based treatment Interaction Guidance, and psychodynamically-oriented child-parent psychotherapy. Schechter and colleagues showed a significant change in the way mothers perceived their own child and their relationship together.
VIG (Video Interaction Guidance).
In VIG (Video Interaction Guidance) the client is guided to analyse and reflect on video clips of their own interactions (e.g. a mother with her infant). Research results include that VIG enhances positive parenting skills, decreases/alleviates parental stress and is related to more positive development of the children. VIG is recommended by NICE in the UK.
Public Health Programs.
Tamars Children.
This is a scheme in which a version of the Circle of Security intervention was added to a jail diversion program for pregnant women with a history of substance abuse. Preliminary data indicates a 68% rate of secure infant-mother attachment in the first relatively small (19) sample. This is a rate of secure attachment typically found in low risk samples.
Florida Infant Mental Health Pilot Programme.
This project tested the provision of 25 sessions of Child–Parent Psychotherapy (see above) for mothers investigated or substantiated for child maltreatment through court-based teams. There were no further reports of maltreatment by participants during and immediately after the programme and positive changes in maternal and child behaviours were noted. The advocacy organisation Zero to Three is supporting such teams being established in other states.
Foster Care Interventions.
Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up (ABC).
This an intervention programme aimed at infants who have experienced early adverse care and disruptions in care. It aims to provide specialized help for foster carers in recognition of the fact that a young child placed in foster care has to deal with the loss of attachment figures at a time when maintaining contact with attachment figures is vital. It targets key issues: providing nurturance for infants when the carers are not comfortable providing nurturance, overriding tendencies to respond in kind to infant behaviors and providing a predictable interpersonal environment.
It is essentially a training programme for surrogate caregivers. It has four main components based on four propositions:
Caregiver and child behaviors are assessed before and after intervention, as is the child's regulation of neuroendocrine function. The intervention consists of 10 sessions administered in caregivers homes by professional social workers. Sessions are videotaped for feedback and for fidelity. The intervention is currently being assessed in a randomized clinical trial involving 200 foster families, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health. Half the infants are assigned to the Developmental Education for Families programme as a comparison intervention. (DEF:Dozier 2003). The developers themselves point out that they do not test for caregiver commitment although they state this may or may not be a critical omission as they consider caregiver commitment to be a crucial variable in terms of child outcomes.
A modified version has been introduced for birth parents which is currently being tested in a small group.
New Orleans Intervention/Tulane Infant Team.
This is a foster care intervention devised by J.A. Larrieu and C.H Zeanah in 1998. The program is designed to address the developmental and health needs of children under the age of 5 who have been maltreated and placed in foster care. It is funded by the state government of Louisiana and private funds. It is a multidisciplinary approach involving psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, paediatricians and paraprofessionals - all with expertise in child development and developmental psychopathology.
The aim of the intervention is to support the building of an attachment relationship between the child and foster carers, even though about half of the children eventually return to their parents after about 12 to 18 months. The designers note Mary Doziers program to foster the development of relationships between children and foster carers (ABC) and her work showing the connection between foster children's symptomology and foster carers attachment status. Work is based on findings that the qualitative features of a foster parents narrative descriptions of the child and relationship with the child have been strongly associated with the foster parents behavior with the child and the child's behavior with them. The aim was to develop a programme for designing foster care as an intervention.
The theoretical base is attachment theory. There is a conscious effort to build on recent, although limited, research into the incidence and causes of Reactive attachment disorder and risk factors for RAD and other psychopathologies.
Soon after coming into care the children are intensively assessed, in foster care, and then receive multi modal treatments. Foster carers are also formally assessed using a structured clinical interview which includes in particular the meaning of the child to the foster parent. Individualised interventions for each child are devised based on age, clinical presentation and information on the child/foster carer match. The assessment 'team' remains involved in delivering the intervention. Those running the programme maintain regular phone and visit contact and there are support groups for foster parents.
Barriers to attachment are considered to be as follows;
Interventions include supporting foster parents to learn to help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child's distress and to understand the child's signals, especially 'miscues' as the signals of such children are often confusing as a consequence of their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships. Foster carers are taught to recognize what such children actually need rather than what they may appear to signal that they need. Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers. Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are. Foster carers are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.
As of 2005, 250 children had participated in the programme. Outcome data published in 2001 revealed a 68% reduction in maltreatment recidivism for the same child returning to its parent(s)and a 75% reduction in recidivism for a subsequent child of the same mother. The authors claim the programme not only assists the building of new attachments to foster parents but also has the potential impact a families development long after a returned child is no longer in care.
Differentiation from attachment therapy.
It is critical to differentiate therapies based on attachment theory from the "unfortunately named" attachment therapy. (However, the use of the terms "attachment therapy" and "attachment-based therapy" is not consistent in literature and on the Internet). Attachment therapy, also known as 'holding therapy', is a group of unvalidated therapies characterized by forced restraint of children in order to make them relive attachment-related anxieties; a practice considered incompatible with attachment theory and its emphasis on 'secure base'. The conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. In 2006, the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) Task Force reported on the subjects of attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems and laid down guidelines for the future diagnosis and treatment of attachment disorders. The Taskforce was largely critical of attachment therapy's theoretical base, practices, claims to an evidence base, non-specific symptoms lists published on the internet, claims that traditional treatments do not work and dire predictions for the future of children who do not receive attachment therapy. The controversy also extends to the theories, diagnoses, diagnostic practices, beliefs, and social group norms and patient recruitment and advertising practices.

Capitaine abandonné

"Capitaine abandonné" is a 1985 song recorded by French band Gold. It was the lead single from band's second studio album "Capitaine abandonné" on which it features in an extended version as first track. The song was also available in its main version on the next album "Calicoba", released in late 1986. "Capitaine abandonné" was released as Gold's second single overall in January 1986, and achieved a huge success in France where it was a number-one hit.
Song information.
This song is a tribute to celebrities of sports, adventure and singing such as Arnaud de Rosnay or Philippe de Dieuleveult. The music video shows the group performing the song in a bar where men are playing cards. These images alternate with scenes of navigation, during the refrains.
"Capitaine abandonné" was recorded in a live version on the live album "L'Olympia" (1997), "Le Palais des Sports" (1999) and "Live 2004" (2004) and was included on Gold's compilations "La Compil' en Or" (1990) and "Les Plus Grands Succès" (1995). The song is included on many French compilations, such as "Les années tubes spécial 80", "Nostalgie Classiques 80" and "Tubes d'un jour tubes de toujours spécial années 80".
In 2002, the song was covered by Axel Bauer, Patrick Fiori and Gérald De Palmas. This 3:09 version is the ninth track on Les Enfoirés' album "Tous dans le même bateau".
Chart performances.
In France, the single entered the SNEP singles chart at #35 on February 8, 1986, and climbed regularly until reaching the top ten in its sixth week. It finally topped the chart for four weeks, then almost kept on dropping, totalling 13 weeks in the top ten and 24 weeks in the top 50.
Although the song was the most successful one of the band in terms of peak position, it does not remain the most popular in comparison with "Plus près des étoiles" (even if this single was only a number two hit in France).
The song is to date the 318th best-selling single of all time in France.

Li Huaiguang

Li Huaiguang (李懷光) (729 – September 19, 785) was a leading general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, of Mohe extraction. He was credited with saving Emperor Daizong in the face of an attack by the rebel Zhu Ci in 783 but, dissatisfied with the lack of trust that Emperor Dezong displayed in him later, also rebelled, but his rebellion was stunted by the refusals of many of his subordinates to follow him. In 785, facing defeat by Tang imperial forces, he committed suicide.
Background.
Li Huaiguang was born in 729, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His ancestors were Mohe from Balhae, and had originally been surnamed Ru (茹). Li Huaiguang's father was originally named Ru Chang (茹常), but due to his accomplishments while serving as a soldier at Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), was given the imperial surname of Li and a new personal name of Jiaqing (嘉慶).
Service under Guo Ziyi.
Li Huaiguang started his military service when he was young, and he was known for his abilities in martial arts, his bravery, and his strength. He served under Guo Ziyi, who was then serving as the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Shuofang Circuit and who respected him greatly. Early in the "Shangyuan" era (760–762) of Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong, Li Huaiguang became a commander of Guo's guards. Sometime thereafter, he was made the discipline officer of the Shuofang army. During the meantime, for his accomplishments, he was also getting progressively greater honorary positions. It was said that as discipline officer, he was honest, hard-working, harsh, and fierce, and was willing to put people to death for their violation of military disciplines and did not spare his own friends and relatives. As Guo was himself lax toward his officers, he entrusted the matters of discipline to Li, and the army much feared Li.
In 763, during the reign of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, by which time Pugu Huai'en had taken over the Shuofang army and was in a confrontational posture against the imperial government and another military governor, Xin Yunjing (辛雲京) the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Pugu, who was then at Hezhong (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), had a number of Shuofang officers take up strategic positions, and in these maneuvers, Li was stationed at Jin Prefecture (晉州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). By 764, however, most of the Shuofang army had defected back to the imperial cause after Pugu formally rose against the imperial government, and Li was again under Guo's command. In 767, when Guo, under Emperor Daizong's instruction, made a sudden attack against the rebellious general Zhou Zhiguang (周智光), the military governor of Tonghua Circuit (同華, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), Guo had Li and Hun Zhen command the advance troops, although even before Li and Hun could attack, Zhou's own subordinates killed him and surrendered. During a Tufan incursion in 777, it was Li that Guo sent to repel the Tufan troops.
In 777, Li briefly left military service to observe a mourning period for his mother. In 778, he was recalled to military service and commanded the forces of Bin (邠州, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Ning (寧州), and Qing (慶州, both in modern Qingyang, Gansu) Prefectures, and he participated in repelling another Tufan incursion. It was said that at this time, there was an incident during Guo's absence that Li wanted to forge an imperial edict to execute several senior officers, including Wen Ruya (溫儒雅). His plan, however, was thwarted by Guo's secretary Du Huangshang, who confronted him. Du instead sent a number of officers who were disciplinary issues away from the headquarters — perhaps including Li.
As Tang "Jiedushi".
Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong, believing that Guo Ziyi was too lax and had too large of a responsibility area, honored Guo as "Shangfu" (尚父, "like an imperial father") but stripped him of his commands. He divided Guo's responsibility area among Li Huaiguang, Hun Zhen, and Chang Qianguang (常謙光), making Li the military governor of Binning Circuit (邠寧, headquartered in modern Xianyang) as well as the mayor of Hezhong Municipality, governing seven prefectures. Initially, he had difficulty in getting some senior officers whose reputations matched his own — Shi Kang (史抗), Wen Ruya, Pang Xianhe (龐仙鶴), Zhang Xianming (張獻明), and Li Guangyi (李光逸) — to obey him. At the suggestion of the imperial eunuch sent to monitor his army, Zhai Wenxiu (翟文秀), he ordered them to report to the imperial guards at the capital Chang'an to serve as imperial guard officers, but as soon as they left Bin Prefecture he had them arrested and executed, blaming them for a defeat that Hun suffered when commanding them in 773.
In 780, after a plan by the powerful chancellor Yang Yan to build forts in the no man's land between Tang and Tufan territory was opposed by Duan Xiushi the military governor of Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), Yang persuaded Emperor Dezong to strip Duan of his command and recall him. Emperor Dezong had Li assume the command of Jingyuan Circuit as well as Binning Circuit and moved his command to Jingyuan's capital Yuan Prefecture (原州). The Jingyuan soldiers feared Li's reputed harshness, particularly given his execution of the five Binning officers in 779. Duan's assistant Liu Wenxi (劉文喜) took this opportunity to seize the circuit and resist Li's commission, requesting that either Duan be returned to command or that another general, Zhu Ci, be put in command of the circuit. Emperor Dezong agreed with the latter request and gave the command of Jingyuan to Zhu instead. Liu subsequently resisted that move as well and sought aid from Tufan. Emperor Dezong ordered Li and Zhu to attack him. Subsequently, Liu's own subordinates killed him and surrendered. In 781, Emperor Dezong gave Li the command of the previously pared-down Shuofang Circuit (which was given to Chang Qianguang in the 779 division) in addition to Binning.
In 782, with Tian Yue, Zhu Tao (Zhu Ci's brother), Wang Wujun, and Li Na resisting imperial authorities, Emperor Dezong ordered Li to take his Binning and Shuofang soldiers to attack Tian's Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). After Li Huaiguang arrived and joined forces with Ma Sui and Li Baozhen, Ma believed that they should wait and rest their soldiers before attacking, but Li Huaiguang advocated an immediate attack, and did so. He initially had successes against Zhu, but Wang took the opportunity to charge against his troops, cutting them off from each other, and eventually the imperial forces were routed. They were forced to lift their siege of Weibo's capital Wei Prefecture (魏州), but held their position in stalemate against the rebel forces. Emperor Dezong gave Li Huaiguang the honorary chancellor designation of "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事). Subsequently, in light of their victory, the rebel leaders all declared themselves princes independent from Tang.
In fall 783, JIngyuan soldiers, then at Chang'an to be ready for deployment against the rebels in the east, mutinied when they were angry they did not get rewards. Emperor Dezong was forced to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang), while the Jingyuan soldiers supported Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu Ci soon declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin. Upon the news arriving in the imperial camp at Wei Prefecture, Ma, Li Baozhen, and Li Qiu (李艽) withdrew to their own circuits, while Li Huaiguang, under the suggestion of his logistics officer Cui Zong (崔縱), decided to march as quickly as he could toward Chang'an to save Emperor Dezong. By the time that Li Huaiguang arrived in Chang'an's vicinity, Fengtian was under intense siege by Qin troops under Zhu Ci. Li Huaiguang sent his officer Zhang Shao (張韶) to Fengtian to inform Emperor Dezong of his impending arrival, and then attacked Qin forces at Liquan (醴泉, in modern Xianyang) and defeated them. When Zhu Ci heard the news, he, in fear, lifted the siege on Fengtian and withdrew back to Chang'an. It was believed at the time that Li Huaiguang arrived right on time and that, if he were even three days late, Fengtian would have fallen. After the victory, Emperor Dezong gave Li Huaiguang the title of "Zhongshu Ling" (中書令) — the head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng") and a post considered one for a chancellor.
Meanwhile, though, it had become common knowledge that Li Huaiguang despised several officials that Emperor Dezong trusted — the chancellor Lu Qi and other ministers Zhao Zan (趙贊) and Bai Zhizhen (白志貞) — and that he would recommend to Emperor Dezong that those officials be removed. When Lu heard this, he believed that he had to prevent a meeting between Emperor Dezong and Li Huaiguang at all costs, and therefore suggested to Emperor Dezong order Li Huaiguang to attack Chang'an at once. Emperor Dezong agreed, and ordered Li Huaiguang to rendezvous with Li Sheng, Li Jianhui (李建徽), and Yang Huiyuan (楊惠元) to attack Chang'an. Li Huaiguang, angry that he was not even able to meet the emperor, began to resent Emperor Dezong. He stopped his army's movement and submitted petitions accusing Lu and the others of crimes and further accusing them of being responsible for the Jingyuan mutiny. Emperor Dezong was forced to demote and exile Lu, Bai, and Zhao. Li Huaiguang also submitted a petition accusing Zhai Wenxiu of crimes, and Emperor Dezong executed Zhai in response. Only after these events occurred did Li Huaiguang rendezvous with Li Sheng, Li Jianhui, and Yang, in spring 784. Meanwhile, when Emperor Dezong sought aid from Tufan, Tufan's chancellor Shang Jiezan (尚結贊) refused to launch forces unless he could get an explicit cosigning of the aid request by Li Huaiguang, citing Tufan's own laws about how it would only launch troops in aid if the supreme commander of the state seeking aid also agreed with the aid request. Li Huaiguang was vehemently against seeking Tufan aid, however, citing how Tufan troops would surely pillage the region and also seek excessive rewards, and he refused to cosign the aid request, and Shang refused to launch aid troops. Emperor Dezong's trusted advisor Lu Zhi, believing Li Huaiguang to be on the verge of rebellion and fearing that Li Huaiguang would take over the troops under Li Sheng, Li Jianhui, and Yang, urged that those three armies be separated from Li Huaiguang's army and take up position elsewhere; Emperor Dezong repositioned Li Sheng, but believing that relocating Li Jianhui and Yang as well would bring further resentment from Li Huaiguang, did not move them.
Li Huaiguang, indeed, was then in secret communication with Zhu Ci and considering rebellion. Zhu promised Li Huaiguang that he would be willing to divide the realm into two, with both serving as emperors, and would be willing to honor Li Huaiguang like an older brother. Meanwhile, Li Sheng, believing Li Huaiguang to be ready to rebel, requested that precautions be made and that the road to the Hanzhong and Shu (蜀, modern Sichuan) regions be clear, in case of a Li Huaiguang rebellion. Emperor Dezong hesitated, and instead announced that he would go to Xianyang (咸陽, in modern Xianyang) to monitor the advancement of troops. Li Huaiguang, believing that the announcement was against him, further prepared for rebellion. Emperor Dezong, meanwhile, tried to calm Li Huaiguang by sending the official Li Bian (李卞) to award him with the title of "Taiwei" (太尉, one of the Three Excellencies) and an iron certificate (鐵劵, "Tiejuan"), which promised that he would never be executed. Li Huaiguang, believing that these were actually signs of distrust, threw the iron certificate onto the ground and stated:
When Li Bian returned to Fengtian and informed Emperor Dezong of these events, the officials at court began to prepare to evaluate Fengtian if necessary. Soon thereafter, Li Huaiguang made a surprise attack on Li Jianhui and Yang; Li Jianhui barely escaped with his life, while Yang was killed. Li Huaiguang thereafter made a declaration:
On March 21, 784, with Li Huaiguang's declaration and posture of readiness to attack Fengtian, Emperor Dezong fled to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong).
As rebel against Emperor Dezong.
Li Huaiguang sent his officers Meng Bao (孟保), Hui Jingshou (惠靜壽), and Sun Fuda (孫福達) to chase after Emperor Dezong, but the three, not wanting to track down the emperor, intentionally slowed down, allowing Emperor Dezong to flee. Meanwhile, Li Sheng took a defensive posture and also wrote Li Huaiguang letters trying to persuade him to return to the imperial cause; while Li Huaiguang did not do so, he was sufficiently embarrassed and concerned that his soldiers would turn against him in an attack against Li Sheng that he did not attack Li Sheng. Meanwhile, a number of his subordinates, including Han Yougui (韓遊瓌), turned against him, weakening his army. As a result, Zhu Ci stopped treating him as an equal and instead was sending him edicts. His subordinate Li Jinglüe (李景略) tried to persuade him to attack Zhu Ci and resubmit to Tang, but under the suggestion of Yan Yan (閻晏), he decided to instead withdraw from the Chang'an region to Hezhong.
After Li Huaiguang's departure for Hezhong, Emperor Dezong issued an edict declaring his guilt, but also recounting his accomplishments and offering him the title of senior advisor to Emperor Dezong's son, Li Song the Crown Prince, but otherwise stripping him of his posts. The edict further offered Li Huaiguang's Shuofang army the option of deciding their next commander. The edict appeared to draw no reaction from Li Huaiguang.
In fall 784, after Li Sheng had destroyed Zhu's regime (which Zhu had renamed Han) and recaptured Chang'an, allowing Emperor Dezong to return to Chang'an, the imperial eunuch messenger Yin Yuanzhen (尹元貞) was able to persuade Li Huaiguang to resubmit to Emperor Dezong. He sent his son Li Wei to Chang'an to beg Emperor Dezong's forgiveness. Emperor Dezong thereafter sent the official Kong Chaofu (孔巢父) to Hezhong to accept his resubmission. When Kong arrived, Li Huaiguang changed into civilian clothing to show meekness and remorse, but Kong did not tell him to change back into official uniform. When Kong further asked the soldiers, "Who can succeed the "Taiwei" in commanding this army?" the soldiers were incensed, and they rushed and killed Kong and the eunuch Dan Shouying (啖守盈), with no intercession from Li Huaiguang, and Li Huaiguang thereafter again took a posture against the imperial troops. Emperor Dezong sent Hun Zhen and Luo Yuanguang (駱元光) against Li Huaiguang, but they were stopped by Li Huaiguang's officer Xu Tingguang (徐庭光) at Changchun Palace (長春宮, in modern Weinan) and unable to advance. Meanwhile, though, Ma Sui was attacking Li Huaiguang's territory from the north and east and seizing Li Huaiguang's territory piece by piece.
In spring 785, Li Huaiguang's subordinate Lü Mingyue (呂鳴岳) was killed by Li Huaiguang after he discovered that Lü had been in secret communications with Ma. Li Huaiguang also put two other subordinates, Gao Ying and Li Yong, under arrest for associating with Lü. Meanwhile, Ma rendezvoused with Hun at Changchun Palace and put it under siege. By this point, the Shuofang soldiers were largely ready to turn against Li Huaiguang, and when Yan Yan tried to lead them against Han Yougui's Binning army — which was branched off the Shuofang army, and whose soldiers therefore mostly had family relationships with the Shuofang soldiers — the Shuofang soldiers refused to fight against Binning soldiers. Li Huaiguang declared to the soldiers that he was ready to resubmit to Tang and offer tributes to Emperor Dezong, but thereafter did nothing for another month. Meanwhile, as the Chang'an region lacked food, many officials suggested to Emperor Dezong that he pardon Li Huaiguang, but Li Sheng opposed, pointing out five reasons why pardoning Li Huaiguang would have undesirable effects, and Emperor Dezong agreed and did not pardon Li Huaiguang.
In fall 785, under Ma's persuasion, Xu surrendered Changchun Palace, allowing imperial troops to continue to advance to Hezhong. With Ma and Hun approaching Hezhong and Li Huaiguang's soldiers at Hezhong in a panic, Li Huaiguang committed suicide by hanging. His subordinate Niu Mingjun (牛名俊) cut off his head and surrendered. Li Wei killed his brothers and also committed suicide, leaving Li Huaiguang with no male-line progeny. Emperor Dezong, not knowing this at that time, issued an edict sparing Li Huaiguang's sons and granting a mansion to Li Huaiguang's wife Lady Wang, and returning Li Huaiguang's body to his family for proper burial. In 789, Emperor Dezong gave Li Huaiguang's grandson, by a daughter, Yan Baba (燕八八) the new name of Li Chengxu (李承緒) and had him serve as Li Huaiguang's progeny in supporting Lady Wang and worshipping Li Huaiguang.

History.
Located a few kilometers west of Shwebo, the birthplace of Konbaung dynasty, Dabayin was a major source of many Konbaung soldiers and officials, including the country's most famous general Maha Bandula. Having Dabayin as fief was a powerful symbol before one became king. King Naungdawgyi was Prince of Dabayin before he became the second king of Konbaung dynasty in 1760. Crown Prince Thado Minsaw was another famous Prince of Dabayin, who conquered Arakan (now Rakhine State) in 1784. In 1808, Thado Minsaw's son Prince of Sagaing (later King Bagyidaw) inherited the title Prince of Dabayin.
In 2003, Dabayin again became center of attention in Burmese politics. The Dabayin Massacre took place on 30 May 2003, during a tour of the country by the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The last stanzas of a recent poem titled "Diparinga" (), which refers to the ancient name of Dabayin and extols the past glories of the place, by Khin Maung Than, raised the ire of the authorities as they read like a thinly veiled reference to the massacre.

Richard McGhee

Richard McGhee (1851 –7 April 1930) was an Irish Protestant Nationalist home rule politician. A Land League and trade union activist, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for more than 20 years.
Family and education.
McGhee was born in Lurgan, County Armagh in January or early February 1851, the son of a tenant farmer who later became a shopkeeper. McGhee was educated at the local school in Lurgan and then went to Glasgow to become an engineering apprentice. In 1880 he married Mary Campbell, who lived until 1949. They had five sons and a daughter. One of his sons was Henry McGhee who became the Labour MP for Penistone from 1935-1959.
Career.
McGhee was a merchant with connections to industry in County Antrim. He specialised in cutlery and stationery. In the 1880s he became involved in labour and trade union causes. He belonged to the American Knights of Labor which had set up some branches in Britain and by 1887 was one of their organisers in Cradley Heath in the Black Country of the West Midlands. The Knights then sent McGhee to Glasgow to recruit new members. McGhee stepped up his labour activism and developed an interest in radical causes, particularly Irish Home Rule even though he was a Protestant, a member of the Church of Ireland. He was a committed follower of the American political economist Henry George and George's policies around land reform and was prominent in the Irish Land League. In 1889 McGhee was a co-founder of the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) and was for a time its President. In 1893 McGhee resigned from the NUDL but continued to be active in related trade unionism becoming an executive council member of the International Federation of Ship, Dock and River Workers, later the International Transport Workers' Federation and he worked with the National Union of Seamen on various campaigns to improve working conditions.
Politics.
As a strong supporter of Home Rule, McGhee was engaged in political activity and sought a nomination for a Parliamentary seat. In March 1896 he was elected the Nationalist member for South Louth in a by-election and he held the seat until 1900. His by-election platform was home rule on advanced nationalist principles, the endorsement of Catholic demands on education, the complete abolition of landlordism, and support for labourers. After losing his seat in 1900 he returned to the House of Commons at the December 1910 general election to represent Mid Tyrone, beating the sitting Unionist MP, Gerald Fitzgibbon Brunskill, by a majority of 723 votes. He held the seat until it was abolished in 1918. 
As an MP, McGhee was described as an orthodox Irish nationalist. In 1917 one of his meetings in Omagh was broken up by Sinn Féin supporters. McGhee supported the Irish nationalist leader John Redmond and endorsed his decision in 1914 to support the British and Allied war effort at the outbreak of World War I and his condemnation of the Easter rising of 1916. But the reaction of the British government to the rising and the suspension of the Home Rule Act 1914 which Redmond had negotiated and which would have granted a strong measure of Home Rule, destroyed Redmond and his movement to achieve Home Rule through constitutional Parliamentary means. McGhee did not seek re-election in 1918.
Death.
McGhee died at his home in Glasgow on 7 April 1930.

Random House of Canada was established in 1944 as the Canadian distributor of Random House Books. In 1986, Random House launched its extremely successful Canadian publishing program. In 1998 Random House (USA) merged with another major publishing company, Bantam Doubleday Dell. Due to this international merger, both companies' Canadian branches merged as well, publishing international titles in this country as well as maintaining their Canadian publishing program.
Imprints.
Anchor Canada.
Anchor Canada, created in 2001, is a publisher of trade paperback books of fiction and non-fiction. It produces paperback editions of many of Doubleday Canada's award-winning hardcover titles, such as "Mercy Among the Children" by David Adams Richards and "The In-Between World of Vikram Lall" by M.G. Vassanji, both of which won the Scotiabank Giller Prize (in 2000 and 2003 respectively).
In 2002, Anchor Canada published its first original trade paperback titled "The Notebooks: Interviews and New Fiction from Contemporary Writers". They have continued to publish originals since. Some of these titles include "The Fabulous Girls Guide to Decorum" by Kim Izzo and Ceri Marsh, and "Lost in Mongolia" by Colin Angus. 
Bond Street.
Bond Street was created in 2006 by Brad Martin, President and CEO of Random House of Canada, and Maya Mavjee, then Executive Vice-President of Doubleday Publishing. This imprint publishes international fiction and non-fiction. 
Bond Street has published many award-winning international books and brought them to a Canadian audience. Three of Bond Street's international titles have reached #1 on "The New York Times" bestseller list: "The Story of Edgar Sawtelle" by David Wroblewski, "The Thirteenth Tale" by Diane Setterfield, and "Little Bee" by Chris Cleave.
Doubleday Canada.
Established in the 1960s, Doubleday Canada publishes fiction titles from both new and established writers. It also publishes memoirs, social and political journalism, history, business, and sports books. Some of the imprint's most well-known Canadian authors include Pierre Burton and Nino Ricci. Doubleday Canada also works with new and emerging authors, such as Lynn Coady, Michael Crummey, and Michael Redhill.
In 2010 the American company DB Media Distribution Inc. filed for bankruptcy. There was some confusion surrounding this incident, as DB Media Distribution Inc. owned and operated the similarly named "Doubleday Book Club". When they filed for bankruptcy, some believed that Doubleday Canada (the publisher) was going under; when in fact there was no connection between the two. This was discussed by Brad Martin, who stated, "We are saddened for those who worked there, but it has no direct connection to our business."
Knopf Canada.
Knopf Canada was established in 1991 as an editorially independent Canadian branch of Alfred A. Knopf. The parent company, founded in New York in 1915, teamed up with Louise Dennys in order to launch the Canadian house. Dennys was already the publisher of many major Canadian books, through her work at the Toronto publishing house Lester & Orpen Dennys.
Some of Knopf's award-winning Canadian titles include "Barney's Version" by Mordecai Richler, the paperback edition of "The English Patient" by Michael Ondaatje and "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel. One of the most-awarded books to be published by Knopf Canada is "Fall On Your Knees" by Ann-Marie MacDonald, the Canadian author's first novel which was nominated for the Giller Prize in 1996, and went on to win the 1997 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for best first book, the 1997 Canadian Authors Association Literary Award, and the 1998 Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for best fiction book of the year.
In order to support new Canadian writers, in 1996 Knopf Canada established a program called "The New Face of Fiction". Each year editors choose between 1 and 4 books and promote them through the campaign in order to bring some of Canada's most talented new authors to national and international attention.
Random House Canada.
The Random House Canada imprint has been publishing works by Canadian and international authors since 1986. One of their most well-known non-fiction titles is "Shake Hands with the Devil" by Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire, which won the 2003 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing and 2004 Governor General's Literary Award for non-fiction.
In 2009, two Random House Canada publications were nominated for the Giller Prize: "The Golden Mean" by Annabel Lyon, as well as that year's winner, "The Bishop's Man" by Linden MacIntyre. MacIntyre's win represents the first Giller Prize awarded for a book published by the Random House Canada imprint. In early 2011 Random House Canada announced it will be publishing MacIntyre's new novel, titled "Why Men Lie".
Seal Books.
Seal Books was founded in 1977, stemming from a partnership between Bantam Books (an American-based company) and McClelland & Stewart. This imprint specializes in reprints of major fiction hardcover titles. However, Seal has always published original books; it is just not the imprint's main endeavor. Many Seal Books were originally published as Doubleday hardcovers. When Seal Books merged with Random House of Canada, they began publishing mass-market titles from Random House of Canada and Knopf Canada as well.
Seal Books publishes work from many world-renowned Canadian authors. All of Margaret Atwood's novels are published in Seal editions. Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of the "Anne of Green Gables" and "Emily" novels, continues to be a bestseller for Seal Books.
Vintage Canada.
Vintage Canada was established in 1993. It takes its name from the New York-based publishing house, Vintage Books, which was formed in 1954 by Alfred A. Knopf. Vintage Canada publishes paperback editions, choosing primarily from titles originally published by Knopf Canada and Random House Canada. They also publish new books and modern classics originally published elsewhere, as well as some "Vintage Originals".
Vintage Canada publishes three selections from the Canada Reads contest: 2002 winner "In the Skin of a Lion" by Michael Ondaatje, 2006 winner "A Complicated Kindness" by Miriam Toews, and 2010 winner "Nikolski" by Nicolas Dickner.
Speakers House Canada.
Speakers House Canada was launched in 2008 as a joint business and marketing venture between Random House of Canada and McClelland & Stewart. It is meant to serve as a vehicle for showcasing authors who are also in-demand speakers. Brad Martin, President and CEO of Random House of Canada, explained in a press release that authors were often asking for help managing a large number of speaking requests, and many did not have booking agents to handle the demand.
Speakers House Canada organizes its many speakers into topics, and acts as a booking agent for them. While both companies have always promoted bookstore tours for publicity during a book launch, the establishment of Speakers House Canada allows authors to book a wider variety of paid speaking events over a longer period of time.
Adaptations to new technology.
In October 2010, Random House of Canada introduced the "Conversation Starters" application for Apple's iPhone and iPad. Users can test their knowledge and share "facts and tidbits" about their favourite books with friends via email, Facebook and Twitter. They can also read expanded selections from books. Lisa Charters, Senior Vice President of Digital at Random House of Canada explained that the company recognizes the trend toward Web-enabled smartphones and wanted to get involved by introducing a fun and interactive application.
In February 2011, Random House of Canada announced a partnership with OverDrive, a digital distributor of downloadable e-books. Through this new distribution agreement, Canadian libraries, schools and colleges will have access to thousands of Random House titles through OverDrive's e-book catalog. Lisa Charters has stated that "Random House of Canada is committed to bringing the work of authors to readers in whatever format the readers choose".

Diplosolenodes occidentalis

Diplosolenodes occidentalis is a species of air-breathing land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Veronicellidae, the leatherleaf slugs.
Distribution.
"Diplosolenodes occidentalis" was originally discovered and described by Lansdown Guilding from the West Indian island of Saint Vincent. It seems likely that this species is native to most of the Lesser Antilles.
The distribution of "Diplosolenodes occidentalis" includes the Lesser Antilles:
It has been introduced to the Greater Antilles, Central America and northern South America:
It occurs in greenhouses in Logan County, Oklahoma.
This species has not yet become established in the wild in the USA, but it is considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA.
Description.
This slug is most easily recognized by the black speckling on its mantle or hyponota. The body length can reach up to 60 mm.
Ecology.
This species may be found in undisturbed environments as well as in agricultural settings, where it may be regarded as a minor pest.

Boettgerilla pallens

Boettgerilla pallens, common name the worm slug, is a European species of air-breathing land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Boettgerillidae.
Distribution.
The type locality of "Boettgerilla pallens" is Gudauta in Abkhazia.
The native distribution of "Boettgerilla pallens" is believed to be the SW flank of the Caucasus:
Maybe it is also native to the Crimean Mountains and Donetsk Upland in Ukraine
But the species has spread spectacularly over the last half century. Dates of first recorded occurrences in various countries are listed in.
In Europe, "Boettgerilla pallens" was first found in 1949 (in Germany). It has now been become naturalized widely in Central Europe, Northern Europe and Western Europe and Eastern Europe including:
Outside Europe it is also known, presumed as an introduction, from:
Description.
"Boettgerilla pallens" is very narrow and slender slug, almost worm-like and sharply keeled. The color is pale greyish or with bluish hue. The head and keel is slightly darker. The mantle is pointed at its posterior end and equipped with fine concentrical grooves. Sole is pale yellow. Mucus is colourless. Juveniles are yellowish to dirty white.
The body length is up to 60 mm. The width is up to 3 mm.
The shell is small, fragile, 1.5-3 x 0.8-1.5 mm, with median nucleus and growth lines, denser in the posterior part, no thin margin, located below the very terminal section of the pointed end of the mantle.
Reproductive system: Penis is elongate and broader than vagina, epiphallus and spermatheca. Epiphallus is swollen and connected to penis laterally near its posterior end, by a long thin duct, which is thinner than vas deferens. Vagina as long as penis and almost as narrow as vas deferens. There are no accessory glands. The spermatheca is elongate and relatively short.
"Boettgerilla pallens" is much more slender than "Milax gagates". The sole is more slender. In "Milax gagates" the posterior end of the mantle is rounded, its shell is larger and better visible, its colour more yellowish-brownish.
Ecology.
Reise et al. (2000) review aspects of the species distribution, mode of range expansion, and other aspects of its ecology.
"Boettgerilla pallens" inhabits a very wide range of habitats, including gardens, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland, and is tolerant of a wide range of soil pH, calcium content and water content. It lives at altitudes of up to 1750 m in the Caucasus and in Switzerland at up to 1600 m, but usually below 700 m It can be considered as synanthropic, although it is now often found also in undisturbed habitats.
Although it may often been found under logs and stones, it is predominantly subterranean, adapted to moving through earthworm burrows and similar spaces in soil, 2–20 cm (maximum up to 60 cm) below surface. Snails move rapidly away from bright light sources.
Feeding is seldom intensive: slugs usually take a few bites (earthworm faeces, detritus etc., also arionid eggs) and move on. It has been considered as a pest in European greenhouses and gardens, because slugs feed on soft plant tissues.
Mating and egg-laying is during late summer and into autumn in Britain (October in Germany). Eggs are laid as several 1-6 egg clutches 9–27 cm deep below the surface. Adults survive egg-laying but die shortly afterwards. Juveniles hatch after 20–22 days at 17 °C (in Germany), between October and December (in Britain). Juveniles turn colour from white to grey in May–June.

William Henry Singleton

William Henry Singleton (1843-1938) was an American slave from North Carolina who became a Union soldier during the American Civil War. As a freedman, he moved to New England, where he became a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AME Zion Church) in Portland, Maine. He wrote and published his autobiography in 1922, an account of his rise from slavery of the genre known as slave narratives.
During the American Civil War, Singleton escaped to Union forces and gained his freedom. In the summer of 1863, he recruited and helped lead the First North Carolina Colored Volunteers, which became part of the 35th United States Colored Troops. After being wounded in the Battle of Olustee, Florida in February 1864, he was assigned to garrison duty.
Following the war and his honorable discharge, in 1866 Singleton moved to Connecticut, where he worked and taught himself to read and write. He joined the AME Zion Church, and became a missionary and minister, serving in Portland, Maine. Later he lived and worked in Peekskill, New York. At the age of 95, Singleton marched in a parade of Civil War veterans in Des Moines, Iowa, shortly before his death.
Early life and education.
In his memoir, Singleton said he was born on August 10, 1835 in Craven County, North Carolina near New Bern. (Historians have estimated his birth as 1843.) His mother Lettis Singleton was a slave and his father was the younger brother of his white master John Singleton, who had one of the largest plantations and the most slaves of any planter in the county. (Singleton acquired his wealth by marrying the widow Mrs. Nelson.) The memoir noted that all the slaves were referred to by the Singleton surname.(Singleton, pp. 1–2) 
As Singleton later wrote in his memoir, "y presence on the plantation was continually reminding them of something they wanted to forget." It caused a quarrel between the brothers. (Singleton, pp. 1–2). Because John Singleton was embarrassed by his mixed-race nephew, he sold the boy at age four to a trader, who took him to a widow in Atlanta, Georgia. She had a "slave farm", training slaves for service and selling them at a profit. Determined to be with his mother, at the age of seven, William ran away and made his way back to New Bern. His mother hid him for three years, as he would go under the floorboards to escape notice. 
After the overseer Nelson discovered him, he sold the boy again. Singleton was held for a time by a Mrs. Wheeler, who he said was kindly. Hearing that she intended to sell him, he escaped to New Bern and found work for a time as a bellhop at the Moore Hotel. Finally the boy returned to the Singleton plantation, where his master agreed to keep him and have him work in the fields. His determination and inventiveness in order to be with his mother were characteristics he used all his life.
Civil War.
The Civil War broke out and, at age 26, Singleton gained permission to drill with the First North Carolina Cavalry, recruited by Samuel Hyman of Craven County, a West Point graduate. The company was stationed at New Bern until March 14, 1862. The Union generals Burnside and Foster captured New Bern and drove the Confederates back to Kinston.
With the First North Carolina Cavalry in disarray, Singleton escaped and fled to New Bern. He secured an audience with General Burnside’s secretary and volunteered as a guide and informant. The Union victory attracted many escaped slaves to the city. In New Bern, Singleton helped raise a regiment of 1000 freed slaves, as many men wanted to fight for the Union. 
Ten thousand slaves arrived at the town, where the Union established the Trent River contraband camp to house them and their families. The Army appointed Horace James, a Congregational chaplain from Massachusetts, as the "Superintendent of Negro Affairs for the North Carolina District." He directed operations at the contraband camp, setting up classes for former slaves as well as organizing work details. He also managed development of a Freedmen's Colony on Roanoke Island. 
Singleton helped organized the First North Carolina Colored Volunteers. He served as the group's unofficial colonel, but when it came time for action, the unit was assigned white officers. The US Army trained and armed the men and the regiment was shipped to South Carolina, where they participated in the siege of Charleston.
When President Abraham Lincoln approved the use of blacks as armed troops for the Union Army, Singleton’s recruits in February 1864 were designated part of the 35th United States Colored Troops (USCT), which also included freedmen who had escaped from Virginia, and he became a sergeant.
In 1864, the 35th USCT were sent to Florida as part of a campaign to be led by Brigadier General Truman Seymour. The 35th USCT participated in the Battle of Olustee, Florida, on February 20, 1864. They were commanded by Lt. Colonel William Reed and Major Archibald Bogle. The Union forces gave way before a Confederate ambush, and the 35th USCT and 54th Massachusetts lost more than 200 men while helping defend the Union line of retreat. Seymour was severely criticized by the Northern press for his losses in the battle.
In April following this and the Battle of Port Hudson, President Lincoln said, 
"There have been men who have proposed to me to return to slavery the black warriors of Port Hudson & Olustee to their masters to conciliate the South. I should be damned in time & eternity for doing so." - April 19, 1864 ("Collected Works" 7: 506-507) 
Wounded at Olustee, Singleton was assigned to a 35th garrison in South Carolina, which was occupied by Union troops through the remainder of the war. Others of the 35th USCT were assigned to Florida. He was honorably discharged on June 1, 1866.
Postbellum years.
Singleton moved to the North, as did many freedmen, and he settled in New Haven, Connecticut. He worked for six years as a coachman for Henry Trowbridge. After his death, Singleton was hired by his brother Tomas Trowbridge, and worked for him for 25 years.
Marriage and family.
Singleton married his first wife Maria Wanton in New Haven and they had a child together. After joining the AME Zion Church in the city, Singleton also worked at getting educated. He studied and saved to buy books, teaching himself to read and write. The AME Zion Church was an independent black denomination founded in New York City earlier in the 19th century. 
After his first wife died in 1898, he married Charlotte Hinman after moving to New York. They had children, and eventually eight grandchildren.
AME Zion Church and New York.
During this period, Singleton also helped with prisoners at the town jail, as he began to do missionary work with the AME Zion Church. He became a deacon and an elder. After his wife Maria died in 1898, Singleton entered the itinerant ministry and devoted all his time to the church. For three years he traveled and evangelized in Portland, Maine. 
He moved to New York City and, after several years, in 1906 to Peekskill, New York. During his New York years, he married again to Charlotte Hinman, and they reared a family together. He worked for various employers through World War I. Through all these years of freedom, Singleton voted and took pride in his ability to take on the obligations of a citizen and act as a free man. 
Singleton wrote his autobiography, "Recollections of My Slavery Days" (1922), which was one of the later slave narratives to be published. It appeared in serial form in the Peekskill newspaper. He concluded his account with pride: "Now I feel that I am a part of the country, that I have an interest in its welfare and a responsibility to it. Now I am treated as a man."
Always proud of his service, Singleton attended a Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) reunion at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in 1937. In September 1938, he attended another GAR reunion in Des Moines, Iowa, where he marched 15 blocks in the heat with 118 other veterans. He died soon after of a heart attack at the estimated age of 95.
Accounts such as Singleton's have been critical for historians' understanding of the slavery years. During the 1930s and the Great Depression, people of the Federal Writers' Project interviewed former slaves in the South to gather their histories. This work was published in 1941 as the "Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves".

USS Zaanland (ID-2746)

USS "Zaanland" (Id. No. 2746) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy in 1918.
SS "Zaanland" was a steel-hulled, single-screw cargo vessel completed in 1900 at Port Glasgow, Scotland, by Russell and Company. The Royal Dutch Lloyd line owned her at the outbreak of World War I. The ship sought security at Hampton Roads, Virginia, lest, at sea, she fall prey to warships of the Royal Navy
On 20 March 1918, "Zaanland" was seized at Newport News, Virginia, by the United States Government under the right of angary, which allowed a belligerent power to use the property of a neutral nation if necessary, subject to full indemnification. She was acquired by the United States Navy for use by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) on 25 March 1918, the cargo ship was assigned the identification number (Id. No.) 2746 and commissioned as USS "Zaanland" at Hampton Roads on 29 March 1918, Lieutenant Commander Daniel Brown, USNRF, in command.
"Zaanland" was repaired and fitted out at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, before sailing for the Gulf of Mexico on 4 April. Arriving at New Orleans, Louisiana on 11 April, she simultaneously underwent further repairs and conversion work and loaded of general cargo consigned by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps. She departed New Orleans on 20 April and arrived back at Hampton Roads on 25 April.
"Zaanland" sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 30 April, in Convoy HN-67, bound for La Pallice, France. During the voyage, in a heavy mist at 20:26 on 12 May, she apparently suffered a rudder casualty and was rammed by the tanker . The collision tore a jagged, hole in the cargo ship's starboard side, amidships between her bridge and fire room. "Zaanland" soon assumed a heavy list and began to sink by the bow. At 20:40, all hands were called topside as boats were launched. Within an hour, all of "Zaanland"s crew were safely aboard the United States Army-chartered Munson Line cargo ship SS "Munalbro", which later in 1918 would be commissioned into the U.S. Navy as .
Although settling deeper in the water with each passing hour, "Zaanland" remained afloat into the next day. At 04:00 on 13 May, Lt. Cdr. Brown reboarded "Zaanland" and inspected the ship. He found that there was no hope of towing the vessel to port and predicted that she probably would sink within a few hours. His observation proved to be correct, for "Zaanland" sank, bow first, at 07:10 on 13 May.
"Munalbro" — while endeavoring to overtake the convoy — soon met SS "Minnesota" "en route", and transferred "Zaanland"s crew to the west-bound vessel for passage back to the United States.

Country McCleester

George "Country McCloskey" McCheester or John McCleester (fl. 1841-1850) was an American bare-knuckle boxer and sportsman involved in the early history of pugilism and prize fighting in Old New York. A well known fighter in his youth, his 1841 bout with Tom Hyer at Caldwell's Landing reportedly lasted nearly 3 hours and went to 101 rounds before the "Pride of Chatham Square" seconds threw up the sponge. Considered one of the greatest fights in the city's history, Hyer was recognized as the top fighter in the United States and awarded the American heavyweight championship. He and Yankee Sullivan were part of a group of promoters arrested following the death of boxer Thomas McCoy who died during a match against Christopher Lilly in Westchester County on September 13, 1842. Sullivan, who was the main promoter, was sentenced to two years in prison while McCleester and the others received light jail sentences or fines. McCleester had served as one of the cornermen during the bout.
McCleester first became involved with Captain Isaiah Rynders' Empire Club with John Morrissey during the early 1840s and eventually became an active member of the Democratic Party. Around the time of the nomination for Henry Clay, Johnny Austin was supposed to have been offered $2,000 to bring himself and several members over to the rival Whig Unionist Club including McCleester, Manny Kelly, Bill Ford, Mike Philips and Dave Scandlin. It was hoped that McCleester and the others would be able to bolster support for the Whigs, but the offer was refused. 
Involved in graft, corruption and election fraud in Manhattan's Sixth Ward during the 1840s and 50s, later to become known as the Tweed Ring, McCleester was one of several lieutenants to Isaiah Rynders, along with Dirty Face Jack, Edward Z.C. Judson and Yankee Sullivan. He later accompanied Yankee Sullivan as his cornerman during Sullivan's much publicized battle against Hyer in Still Pond Creek, Maryland on February 7, 1849. After the 16th round, McCleester signaled to the referee to stop the match. Three months later, he and Dirty Face Jack assisted Rynders in instigating the Astor Place Riot in which an Irish-American mob chased British actor William Charles Macready from the Astor Opera House. 
He was among several prominent sportsmen who supported Rynders when, in the autumn of 1850, he announced his intention to become active in the Sixth Ward and run for the state assembly. McCleester was present along with Bill Ford, Tom Maguire and Hen Chenfrau when Rynders attended the primary meeting at Dooley's Long Room with "hundreds of the captain's friends". Opposition from Matthew T. Brennan, Constantine J. Donoho and other Five Points political leaders however, who considered the political club thugs and squatters, eventually defeated Rynders over control of the ward.

The Jersey Black apple is an old North American variety of apple, or "Malus domestica"; it is thought to have originated circa 1817, but has fallen somewhat out of favor. It is also known as the Black Apple because its skin is very dark red, appearing almost black. It is a dessert apple with sweet white firm flesh. It was once used for the production of cider. This variety is notable for a cross with a McIntosh red to produce the Macoun, which was formerly thought to have produced the Honeycrisp.

Arthur Cecil

Arthur Cecil Blunt, better known as Arthur Cecil (1 June 1843 – 16 April 1896) was an English actor, comedian, playwright and theatre manager. He is probably best remembered for playing the role of Box in the long-running production of "Cox and Box", by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand, at the Royal Gallery of Illustration.
Born in London, Cecil took up amateur dramatics from an early age. In 1869, he made his professional debut in the one-act comic opera "Cox and Box" at the Gallery of Illustration in the role of Mr. Box, a part that became his signature role. There Cecil started a successful association with the German Reed Entertainments, appearing in numerous comedies, farces, operettas and burlesques, such as "Beggar My Neighbour: A Blind Man's Bouffe" and "Charity Begins at Home" in 1872. He remained with the company for five years.
Cecil appeared at many London theatres during his career including the Globe, the Gaiety, and Prince of Wales's Theatre. He appeared in such successful pieces as "Peril" as Sir Woodbine Grafton, "Duty", "The Vicarage", as Noel Haygarth and "Caste" by T. W. Robertson with the Bancrofts also in the cast, all in 1879, and later in other Robertson pieces. Cecil joined a company at the Royal Court Theatre in 1881 and was a co-manager of that theatre from 1883. There, he played in farces including "The Rector", "The Magistrate", "The Schoolmistress" and "Dandy Dick", as well as the title role in "The Cabinet Minister" in 1890. Later productions there included "The Millionaire", as Mr. Guyon, and "Mamma", as Miles Henniker.
Biography.
Cecil was born in Mayfair, Westminster, London, England. His parents were Joseph Blunt, a solicitor, and Mary Blunt, née James. He studied for the legal profession, but he acted in amateur theatricals, and decided to pursue acting instead.
Early career.
Cecil began performing as an amateur at the Richmond Theatre. In 1866, he appeared in the role of Bouncer in an amateur production of the one-act comic opera, "Cox and Box" by F. C. Burnand and Arthur Sullivan. Coincidentally, on Easter Monday 1869, Cecil made his professional debut at the Gallery of Illustration in a bill that included "Cox and Box", this time as Mr. Box. The first piece on the bill was W. S. Gilbert's "No Cards", in which he played Mr Churchmouse. Thereafter, Cecil often played Box in productions of "Cox and Box".
This was Cecil's first appearance in a German Reed Entertainment, and he remained steadily with the German Reeds for five years thereafter. With that company, he appeared in numerous comedies, farces, operettas and burlesques, such as "Beggar My Neighbour: A Blind Man's Bouffe" adapted by Burnand from "Les deux aveugles" by Jacques Offenbach (1870) and "Charity Begins at Home" (1872) by Alfred Cellier and B. C. Stephenson. After "No Cards", he appeared in other Gilbert works at the Gallery, including "Ages Ago" (1869), "Our Island Home" (1870), "A Sensation Novel" (1871) and "Happy Arcadia" (1872). He also wrote some works for the German Reeds, including "Dora's Dream" (1873), in which he also performed, at St. George's Hall.
Cecil joined the company at the Globe Theatre later in 1874, playing in such works as Gilbert's "Committed for Trial", as Jonathan Wagstaff and "Wig and Gown" by James Albery, as Mr Justice Jones. In September, Cecil was at the Gaiety Theatre, London, reprising his role in "Cox and Box" opposite the composer's brother, Fred Sullivan, as Box. The next year, he was back at the Gaiety in "The Merry Wives of Windsor" as Dr. Caius; and at the Opera Comique, in "As You Like It", as Touchstone, in "The School for Scandal" as Sir Peter Teazle, and in "She Stoops to Conquer", as Tony Lumpkin. In 1876, he was back at the Globe. There, he originated the role of Dr. Downward in "Miss Gwilt" by Wilkie Collins. He was at the Prince of Wales's Theatre during the following three years. There, he played in many pieces, including "Peril" by Saville Rowe and B. C. Stephenson, as Sir Woodbine Grafton (together with the Bancrofts); "Duty" by Albery; "The Vicarage", as Noel Haygarth; and "Caste" by T. W. Robertson (with the Bancrofts), as Sam Gerridge, all in 1879. The Bancrofts moved to the Haymarket Theatre in 1880, and Cecil went with them, appearing in Lord Bulwer-Lytton's "Money", as Mr. Graves. He then played in other Robertson comedies at the Comedy Theatre, including "Society" and "Ours".
Later years.
Beginning in 1881, Cecil joined the company at the Royal Court Theatre. From 1883, he was co-manager, with John Clayton, of that theatre. There, he played in a number of farces by A. W. Pinero, including "The Rector", as Connor Hennessy; "The Magistrate" (1885), as Mr. Posket; "The Schoolmistress" (1886), as Vere Queckett; "Dandy Dick" (1887), as Blore, the butler; and in the title role of "The Cabinet Minister" (1890) He also appeared there in G. W. Godfrey's "The Millionaire", as Mr. Guyon, and created the role of Miles Henniker in Sydney Grundy's "Mamma" (1888). Cecil and Clayton yielded management at the Court to Mrs. John Wood and Arthur Chudleigh when the theatre closed in 1887, although Cecil continued acting at the theatre after it was rebuilt.
Cecil played the title role in "Pickwick" by Burnand, with music by Edward Solomon, at the Comedy Theatre in 1889 and Lord Burnham in "The Crusaders", a comedy by Henry Arthur Jones at the Avenue Theatre in 1891. In 1893, he appeared as Baron Stein in "Diplomacy" by Clement Scott and B. C. Stephenson with the Bancrofts at the Garrick Theatre. In 1894, he was again in "Money" with the Bancrofts at the Comedy. He continued acting in plays and musical pieces, mostly at the Court Theatre, and sometimes at the Comedy, Globe, Avenue and other houses, often reprising one of his successful roles. In 1895 at the Court, he made one of his last successes in "Vanity Fair" by G. W. Godfrey.
Throughout his career, Cecil wrote comedy sketches such as "Bright Idea" (1881) with composer Arthur Law, and songs, some of which became popular or were interpolated into musical theatre pieces, such as "Little Jack Sheppard" (1885). He supplemented his income by entertaining at private events and parties.
Cecil died on 16 April 1896 at Brighton at the age of 52 and was buried at the Old Mortlake Burial Ground, then in the Municipal Borough of Barnes, Surrey and now maintained by the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. An official notice relating to his estate described him as "late of Clarence-chambers Haymarket and the Garrick Club London, Comedian".

Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court pertaining to the scope of liability of secondary actors, such as lawyers and accountants, for securities fraud under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In a 5-3 decision authored by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that "aiders and abettors" of fraud cannot be held secondarily liable under the private right of action authorized by §10(b) of the Exchange Act. Such defendants can only be held liable if their own conduct satisfies each of the elements for §10(b) liability. Therefore, the plaintiff must prove reliance, in making a decision to acquire or hold a security, upon a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant.
"Stoneridge" was recognized by "The New York Times" as the “most important securities fraud case in years,” and also commented by "Wall Street Journal", "Forbes", and "Business Week".

<doc id="19655856" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19655856" title="Nelson's Band of Brothers">
Nelson's Band of Brothers

Band of Brothers was a phrase used by Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson to refer to the captains under his command just prior to and at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. The phrase, taken from Shakespeare's "Henry V", later came to be more generally applied to his relationship with the captains and men under his command, such as at the Battle of Trafalgar. The usage helped to popularise the phrase in reference to a close-knit group of fighting men.
The original Band of Brothers.
One of Nelson's earliest uses of the phrase is in a letter written shortly after the Spanish entry into the war. Nelson, eager for action, had hoped to be given command of a squadron cruising off the Spanish coast, but was passed over. Dismayed he wrote of his indignation and disappointment, but addedYet, if I know my own thoughts, it is not for myself, or on my own account chiefly, that I feel the sting and the disappointment! No! it is for my brave officers; for my noble-minded friends and comrades. Such a gallant set of fellows! Such a band of brothers! My heart swells at the thought of them!
Shortly afterwards, the French fleet sailed from Toulon under the command of Vice-Admiral Brueys, carrying Napoleon and a French invasion force bound for Malta and Egypt. The British commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir John Jervis reinforced Nelson with several ships of the line and sent him in search of the French. Nelson was initially unsuccessful, missing the French when they passed by, and invaded, Malta in June. They then sailed on to Egypt, and carried out a successful landing at Alexandria in early July. Nelson finally caught up with the French fleet on 1 August, anchored in Aboukir Bay. Nelson immediately prepared an attack, taking the French by surprise, and won a decisive victory, capturing or burning most of the fleet. 
The Nile captains.
Under Nelson's command at this time were:
Of the brothers, Nelson had already served alongside several. Miller had been his flag captain at Cape St Vincent, where Troubridge had also commanded a ship. The Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife some months later reunited Miller and Troubridge, whilst Captains Hood and Thompson were also present.
After the battle Nelson wrote a number of letters and dispatches, often using the term 'band of brothers' to refer to those who had fought alongside him. To his commanding officer, Lord St Vincent, he wrote, referring to Alexander Ball, His activity and zeal are eminently conspicuous even amongst the Band of Brothers - each, as I may have occasion to mention them, must call forth my gratitude and admiration. He wrote another dispatch whilst at Naples on 8 January 1799 to Earl Howe, declaring 'I had the happiness to command a Band of Brothers...'
Tactics and later brothers.
Nelson's ability to inspire his captains, and to leave them free to fight their ships as they believed best in the heat of the battle was linked to his description of the captains as his 'band of brothers', and later came to be referred in a general manner to those under his command later in his career. His close consultation with them prior to actions was considered an important factor. When describing the preparations for Trafalgar, the "Cambridge History of Warfare" remarked '...Nelson consulted regularly with his captains until that 'band of brothers' understood his goals and methods...'. Describing one of these conferences Nelson himself wrote hen I came to explain to them the 'Nelson Touch', it was like an electric shock. Some shed tears, all approved...and from Admirals downwards it was repeated - 'It must succeed, if ever they allow us to get at them! You are, my Lord, surrounded by friends whom you inspire with confidence.' Of the officers who served with him at the Nile, 13 would later reach flag rank. The exceptions were Westcott, killed during the battle, and Miller, who was killed during an accidental explosion aboard his ship in 1799. Some of the surviving brothers would serve under Nelson again. At the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, Hardy had command of his own ship, whilst Foley was Nelson's flag captain. Thompson was also present, losing a leg in the action. Hardy was Nelson's flag captain aboard at Trafalgar, where Berry also commanded a ship.
Legacy.
Nelson's inspirational and motivational abilities became the subject of later study. Some analysts see the 'band of brothers' as 'implying social equality in the service of the country.' The phrase 'band of brothers' has continued to be popular as a reference to a close-knit community, usually of military figures.

Abigail Child

Abigail Child is a filmmaker, poet, and writer who has been active in experimental writing and media since the 1970s. She has completed more than thirty film and video works and installations, and six books. An acknowledged pioneer in montage, Child’s early film work addressed the interplay between sound and image through reshaping narrative tropes, prefiguring many concerns of contemporary film and media.
Academics.
In 1968, Abigail Child graduated from Radcliffe College in Harvard University with a degree in history and literature. She has received a Guggenheim Fellowship in Film. She has taught at several universities, including New York University, Massachusetts College of Art, and Hampshire College. She has been the chair of Film and Animation department at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston since 2000 and was appointed to a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In 2009, she was awarded the Rome Prize.
Career in film, writing, and poetry.
Child began making films in 1970s, producing seven independent documentaries shot on 16mm. From the middle of the 70s she turned to experimental montage and in the 80s her work explores gender and strategies for remaking narrative. "Is This What You Were Born For?" is a major, seven-part experimental work from this period, completed over nine years, which included the cult classics "Mayhem" and "Covert Action". (see Filmography). In the 90s Child poetically envisioned and interrogated public spaces in such films as "B/side"(1996), about urban homelessness on the Lower East Side of New York city, and "Below the New: A Russian Chronicle" (1999), filmed in St. Petersburg.
In the 21st century, Child’s film and video has explored history, memory, and cultural experiences—the politics of place and identity. Digital works like "Cake + Steak" (2004) and "The Future Is Behind You" (2005) investigate the awkward drama of the everyday, often utilizing found material to examine the past. "MirrorWorld" (2007) is a multi-screen installation that incorporates parts of Child’s “foreign film” series to explore narrative excess. Key works include "Surface Noise" (2000), "Dark Dark"(2001), "Where The Girls Are" (2002), "Cake and Steak" (2004), "The Future Is Behind You" (2004), "To and No Fro" (2005), and"Mirror World" (2006). Her feature video documentary "On The Downlow" (2007)), is an exploration of bisexuality and an intimate look at a little viewed underground scene.
In 2012, Child completed a feature film, "Shape of Error," an imaginary “home movie” based on the diaries of Mary Shelley during her marriage with Percy Shelley.
Child is also the author of five books of poetry (published between 1983 and 2012) and a book of critical writings: "This Is Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film" (2005).
A collection of writings by various authors on "Is This What You Were Born For?", including a DVD of the film series, was published in 2011.

Jeffrey Raymond Jones (born October 22, 1957 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is a retired American professional baseball player who appeared in 16 Major League games as an outfielder, pinch hitter and first baseman for the Cincinnati Reds. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .
Jones attended the University of Iowa and was selected by Cincinnati in the 20th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft. In 1982, his fourth pro season, he led the Class A Midwest League in home runs (42), drove in 101 runs, and was selected to the All-Star team. He began the 1983 season on the Reds' Major League roster and started 13 games as a right fielder, left fielder and first baseman during a three-week April stretch. But he collected only ten hits in 44 at bats, with three doubles, no home runs, 11 bases on balls and 13 strikeouts. His best games came April 9 against the Chicago Cubs, when he went 2-for-3, and on April 17, when he netted three hits in three at bats against the San Francisco Giants.
He was sent back to the minors after April 24, and played through the 1985 season. He hit 125 homers as a minor leaguer, but struck out 749 times in 694 games.

Architecture of St. Louis

The architecture of St. Louis exhibits a variety of commercial, residential, and monumental architecture. St. Louis is known for the Gateway Arch, the tallest monument constructed in the USA. Architectural influences reflected in the area include French Colonial, German, early American, and modern architectural styles.
Skyscrapers.
St. Louis was home to a cluster of early skyscrapers during the late 19th century. Two of Louis Sullivan's important early skyscrapers stand among a crop of similar office buildings and department stores built up between 1890 and 1915. His Wainwright Building (1891) features strong base-pediment-shaft massing and an insistently vertical pattern of ornament; his Union Trust Building of 1893 was stripped of its cave-like street-level ironwork in 1924. 
Beyond Sullivan's work, other significant downtown skyscrapers of those years were Railway Exchange Building (1913) by John Mauran and the now-demolished Merchants Exchange Building. Some warehouse and factory buildings of the early 20th century have been transformed into local attractions, such as the International Shoe factory building and its renovation into the St. Louis City Museum. However, some buildings of significance have been demolished, such as the St. Louis Century Building.
In Midtown St. Louis, a group of theaters and skyscraper office buildings was constructed between the Central West End and downtown, such as the Gothic Revival Continental-Life Building (1929) and the Neo-Renaissance Fox Theatre (1929). The Fox, designed by C. Howard Crane, was an exuberant movie palace that once seated more than 5,000 and was the second-largest cinema in the United States. Since 1982, it has been used as a performance hall. Another venue in Midtown built in the 1920s is the Neo-classical Powell Symphony Hall (1925), formerly a cinema and vaudeville theater, now the home of the St. Louis Symphony.
Some notable post-modern commercial skyscrapers were built downtown in the 1970s and 1980s, including the One US Bank Plaza (1976), the AT&T Center (1986), and One Metropolitan Square (1989), which is the tallest building in St. Louis. One US Bank Plaza, the local headquarters for US Bancorp, was constructed for the Mercantile Bancorporation in the Structural expressionist style, emphasizing the steel structure of the building. 
During the 1990s, St. Louis saw the construction of the largest United States courthouse by area, the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse (completed in 2000). The Eagleton Courthouse is home to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The most recent high-rise buildings in St. Louis include two residential towers: the Park East Tower in the Central West End and the Roberts Tower located in downtown.
Landmarks and monuments.
Several examples of religious structures are extant from the pre-Civil War period, and most reflect the common residential styles of the time. Among the earliest is the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France (locally referred to as the "Old Cathedral"). The Basilica was built between 1831 and 1834 in the Federal style. Other religious buildings from the period include SS. Cyril and Methodius Church (1857) in the Romanesque Revival style and Christ Church Cathedral (completed in 1867, designed in 1859) in the Gothic Revival style.
Only a few civic buildings were constructed during the early 19th century. The original St. Louis courthouse was built in 1826 and featured a Federal style stone facade with a rounded portico. However, this courthouse was replaced during renovation and expansion of the building in the 1850s. The Old St. Louis County Courthouse (locally known as the "Old Courthouse") was completed in 1864 and was notable for having an early cast iron dome and for being the tallest structure in Missouri until 1894. Finally, a customs house was constructed in the Greek Revival style in 1852, but was demolished and replaced in 1873 by the U.S. Customhouse and Post Office.
Because much of the city's early commercial and industrial development was centered along the riverfront, many pre-Civil War buildings were demolished during construction of the Gateway Arch. The city's remaining architectural heritage of the era includes a multi-block district of cobblestone streets and brick and cast-iron warehouses called Laclede's Landing. Now popular for its restaurants and nightclubs, the district is located north of Gateway Arch along the riverfront. Other industrial buildings from the era include some portions of the Anheuser-Busch Brewery, which date to the early 1860s.
St. Louis saw a vast expansion in variety and number of religious buildings during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The largest and most ornate of these is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, designed by Thomas P. Barnett and constructed between 1907 and 1914 in the Neo-Byzantine style. The St. Louis Cathedral, as it is known, has one of the largest mosaic collections in the world. Another landmark in religious architecture of St. Louis is the St. Stanislaus Kostka, which is an example of the Polish Cathedral style. Among the other major designs of the period were St. Alphonsus Liguori (locally known as "The Rock Church") (1867) in the Gothic Revival and Second Presbyterian Church of St. Louis (1900) in Richardsonian Romanesque. 
Early in the 20th century (and during the years before and after the 1904 World's Fair), several churches moved to the Central West End neighborhood, near Forest Park and the fairgrounds. The neighborhood features the Holy Corners Historic District, which is a concentration of several historic religious structures, such as the First Church of Christ, Scientist (1904).
By the 1900 census, St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the country. In 1904, the city hosted a world's fair at Forest Park called the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Its architectural legacy is somewhat scattered. Among the fair-related cultural institutions in the park are the Saint Louis Art Museum designed by Cass Gilbert, part of the remaining lagoon at the foot of Art Hill, and the Flight Cage at the St. Louis Zoo. The Missouri History Museum was built afterward, with the profit from the fair. But 1904 left other assets to the city, like Theodore Link's 1894 St. Louis Union Station, and an improved Forest Park.
Louis Sullivan designed Charlotte Dickson Wainwright's tomb on the north side of Bellefontaine Cemetery, surrounded by a collection of similar tombs for the great old St. Louis families, interesting for their late-Gilded Age artwork. 
Shortly after the Civil War, St. Louis rapidly increased its school system and hospital system. One of the earliest structures and the oldest extant hospital building in St. Louis is the St. Louis Insane Asylum (now the Metropolitan St. Louis Psychiatric Center). The asylum is built of brick in the Italianate style, complete with cast iron dome and cupola reminiscent of the Old Courthouse. 
As St. Louis expanded, the city hall was moved further west of downtown to its present location in 1904 (construction began in 1892). St. Louis City Hall, still in use, was designed by Harvey Ellis in the Renaissance Revival style. City Hall also is reminiscent of the famed Hôtel de Ville, Paris, France. 
Other significant civic buildings from the late 19th century and early 20th century include the U.S. Customhouse and Post Office by Alfred B. Mullett (1873) and the stately St. Louis Public Library by Cass Gilbert (1912). While the Old Post Office has been renovated, the St. Louis Public Library is slated for renovation as of 2010. In 1923 the city passed a $87 million bond issue for re-development of the Civic Plaza along the lines of the City Beautiful movement. This development resulted in some of St. Louis's major civic architecture: the Soldiers' Memorial, the Civil Courts Building, and Kiel Auditorium. 
Then into the 1940s and 1950s a certain sub-genre of St. Louis modernism emerged, with the locally important Harris Armstrong, and a series of daring modern civic landmarks like Gyo Obata's Planetarium, the geodesic-dome Climatron, and the main terminal building at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The Poplar Street Bridge, a 647-foot (197 m) long (197m) deck girder bridge, was built in 1967 and continues to carry three Interstates and one U.S. route. St. Louis also was the headquarters for postwar modernist bank designer Wenceslaus Sarmiento, whose major work in St. Louis is the Chancery Building (1965) on the grounds of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis. The culmination of St. Louis modern architecture is Eero Saarinen's magnificent stainless-steel gesture, the Gateway Arch, centerpiece of the riverside Jefferson National Expansion Memorial.
Residential forms.
The earliest buildings in St. Louis were constructed in the French Colonial style. Although Spain took possession of the Louisiana territory in 1764 via the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762) and the Treaty of Paris (1763) (and defended against a French rebellion in 1768), St. Louis remained largely a refuge for French settlers. Hence, St. Louis remained largely a refuge for French architecture well into the late 18th century. Three distinct types of residential construction existed in early St. Louis, all of which reflected a French influence. The most common was the French Colonial vertical-log house, constructed of palisaded wood beams for walls. Roofs consisted of thatch or wood shingles. According to the St. Louis Preservation Commission, at least two-thirds of St. Louis homes in the late 18th century were of this type.
The second type was a frame house, usually in the French colonial tradition. Such homes were built in the poteaux sur solle (posts on sill) method, in which a wood frame home was built on a heavy wood sill set atop a masonry and rock foundation. Roofing was similar to the palisaded homes.
The third style of early St. Louis homes was a rock house. Only the wealthiest St. Louisans might afford a home built entirely of rock walls with a masonry foundation due to the difficulty of construction. The earliest house in St. Louis, the home of Pierre Laclede, was made of rock. Similar to the palisade and post-in-sill homes, rock houses tended to have steeply pitched roofs with a gradual slope on galleries and porches.
Rural houses.
The earliest American homes in St. Louis were crude, usually of log construction. Outlying homes in the farmlands were minimally ornamented, and were usually of one or two-room construction. However, some rural homes were of the I-house style or were built with central hallways connecting a two-room house. Such rural homes often were overtaken by the rapidly expanding city and demolished. However, some rural homes were more developed and became integrated into the street grid of St. Louis. 
The more developed rural homes in early St. Louis often bear the mark of the Federal Style, with simple and symmetrical facades, 
shuttered windows, and minimal ornament. Although many such homes were built, only a handful survive. Among these is the Lewis Bissell House (1830), now a restaurant and banquet facility. 
Other rural styles found in early St. Louis included Greek Revival, Italianate, and Gothic Revival. The Chatillon-DeMenil House (1849) was originally constructed in the Federal Style, only later to be rebuilt and enlarged in Greek Revival. One of the more notable rural Italianate homes in St. Louis was Tower Grove House (designed by George I. Barnett in 1849), built in what was then Henry Shaw's garden, later becoming Missouri Botanical Garden. 
Other early influences included German architecture, specifically the fachwerk construction method. Fachwerk construction generally has been enclosed in wooden siding, making such homes appear to be traditional frame homes. Because of the relative difficulty of fachwerk construction, few homes were built after 1840 using the technique. Almost all examples of fachwerk construction exist within the Soulard or Carondelet neighborhoods. German immigrants also brought with them a tradition of stone house construction, with several examples remaining in the Carondelet neighborhood.
Urban houses.
The majority of urban homes were of the townhouse type (also known as terraced housing). Similar in style to the country homes of the same period, urban homes in St. Louis were of the Greek Revival, Federal and Italianate styles. Many homes in St. Louis were constructed in a vernacular blending of these forms, even in then-fashionable areas such as Lucas Park or Lafayette Square. Among the homes with a blended style is the Joseph Campbell House (1851), which has been renovated and operated as a museum. Another of Henry Shaw's homes, the Henry Shaw City House (1851), was a prime example of a mixture of Federal and Italianate styles in the city. The Shaw City House later was moved to the Missouri Botanical Garden in the 1890s. One of the oldest extant townhouses in the city is the Eugene Field House (1829).
Some less ornamented urban house designs also originated in the pre-Civil War period. These include a variety of shotgun houses, narrow-front houses with side entry, and flounder houses. St. Louis is home to a large collection of flounder houses, which are narrow homes with side entry but having a sloped roof moving from a side wall to another side wall, often with the gable facing the street. In the working-class neighborhoods of St. Louis where space was at a premium, tenement houses often faced a street while flounder houses faced an alleyway on the same lot.
St. Louis' residential stock expanded dramatically during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Like many other cities, St. Louis has its share of Victorian homes, including a fair number of Second Empire style homes in Lafayette Square. During the late 19th century, St. Louis became significant in urban design for its private places, residential developments with large mansions with commonly owned facilities like streets and gardens. Dating from between 1865 and 1910, many of these developments remain well-preserved and functioning private enclaves.
Among the significant styles found in the private places are Chateauesque, Beaux-Arts (at No. 9 Portland Place, built in 1897), Tudor Revival (at No. 1 Hortense Place), and Jacobethan (at No. 28 Portland Place, built in 1919). However, new styles of architecture were not confined to the private developments. In areas further west, St. Louis homes show the influence of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the Prairie style (especially within what is now the West Cabanne Place Historic District).
After World War I, many new homes began to reflect the Colonial Revival style, with traditional brick, dormers, cornices and a strict symmetry. A prime example of St. Louis Colonial Revival is located at 47 Portland Place. Much of St. Louis' working class housing in the 1920s and 1930s were bungalows, which appear throughout south St. Louis. At the same time, the central corridor extending west from downtown saw an increase in low-rise and high-rise apartment buildings.
Some of the more opulent residential architecture of the 1920s and 1930s was among these apartments and hotels. The Central West End neighborhood features several examples, including the Chase Park Plaza Hotel (built in 1931 in the Art Deco style) and Hampden Hall (built in 1925 in Neo-Renaissance style). 
Few civic buildings existed during the French period, during which time government business often was conducted at the home of the governor (usually the home of Pierre Laclede). The first (and only) religious structure was a palisaded church now, built circa 1770, which was replaced in the early 1810s (and replaced again in 1834 by the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France).
After the sale of Louisiana (including St. Louis) to the United States in 1804, more Americans began moving to the village. These Americans built homes of frame construction prior to the mid-1810s, but after this point, began building using brick. Some photographs exist of these early structures and of French residences from the 18th century; however, no examples of colonial era structures are known to exist in St. Louis.
Urban renewal.
After the 1950s, suburban expansion reduced the commercial and residential density of the city, while in the early 1960s, nearby Clayton, Missouri eliminated its height limitations on buildings. Clayton, which is the county seat of St. Louis County, Missouri, became an alternative to downtown St. Louis for commercial construction in the 1960s and 1970s. Various urban renewal projects cleared several low-income areas of St. Louis for residential housing projects.
The first of these projects was the relatively successful Cochran Gardens, constructed in 1953 and home to white residents until 1956, when the project was integrated. Shortly after the construction of Cochran Gardens, the later-infamous Pruitt–Igoe project replaced the DeSoto-Carr neighborhood with its 33 eleven-story towers. By the mid-to-late 1960s, these projects had become decayed themselves. Although Pruitt–Igoe was designed by Minoru Yamasaki with several innovative living features, the project ultimately was demolished in the 1970s. Although Cochran Gardens' management was turned over to a tenant association in 1976, it later returned to city control in the 1990s and was demolished in 2008 after several years of decay.
In recent years, several organizations have attempted to promote preservation of historic structures of St. Louis. These include the Landmarks Association of St. Louis (a private organization operating since the 1960s) and the Cultural Resource Office (a city government agency which maintains a list of St. Louis city landmarks).

Leavitt Hunt

Col. Leavitt Hunt (1831–February 16, 1907) was a Harvard-educated attorney and photography pioneer who was one of the first people to photograph the Middle East. He and a companion, Nathan Flint Baker, traveled to Egypt, the Holy Land, Lebanon, Turkey and Greece on a Grand Tour in 1851–52, making one of the earliest photographic records of the Arab and ancient worlds, including the Great Sphinx and the Great Pyramid of Giza, views along the Nile River, the ruins at Petra and the Parthenon in Greece.
Biography.
The youngest son of General Jonathan Hunt of Vermont and the former Jane Maria Leavitt, and brother to architect Richard Morris Hunt and painter William Morris Hunt, Leavitt Hunt was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, but grew up in Paris following the early death of his father Jonathan Hunt, a Vermont Congressman whose father had been the state's Lieutenant Governor. 
Leavitt Hunt attended the Boston Latin School, and subsequently enrolled in a Swiss boarding school, finally taking a law degree from the University of Heidelberg. He then enrolled at the Swiss Military Academy in Thun. Hunt was a scholar: he was fluent in French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and could write in both Persian and Sanskrit. 
Hunt's companion on his Middle Eastern journey was a wealthy sculptor from Ohio and friend of the Hunt family. Nathan Flint Baker had been travelling in Europe for a decade, and announced his intention to travel through the Middle East. Hunt decided to join him, meeting him in Florence, Italy, in late September 1851.
Hunt and Baker spent several weeks in Rome practicing photography, and then sailed from Naples to Malta and eventually up the Nile River into the Sinai Peninsula, to Petra (where they were among the first to photograph the ruins), then on to Jerusalem, to what is today Lebanon, then on to Constantinople and Athens, before returning to Paris in May 1852.
Hunt's and Baker's photographs were dazzling, especially for a brand-new medium many had never seen before. They photographed the Great Sphinx and the Pyramids at Giza, the templex complex at Karnak, the Ramesseum at Thebes, and the ruins on the Island of Philae. They travelled farther to photograph the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai, the tombs and temples of Petra, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the ruins at Baalbek, and finally the buildings of the Acropolis in Athens.
The 60 extant photographs from their journey show that Hunt and Baker were keen on the new medium and familiar with its techniques. It was a real partnership: both men brought their own strengths to the process, and images that survive demonstrate their aesthetic acumen as well as their journalistic desire to show the settings in which they worked. One image of an unveiled Ghawazee female dancer, signed on the negative by Hunt himself, is likely the earliest photographic portrait of a Middle Eastern woman. Another image of the less photogenic view from the rear of the Parthenon demonstrates two men unafraid to indulge their take on a revered landmark.
The trip was a logistical challenge. Accompanying the two travelers for part of the journey were Leavitt Hunt's older brother, the architect Richard Morris Hunt, and two other friends. The group hired a "dahaheah" and a crew of 13 Egyptians to take them down the Nile River. Architect Hunt, later famous for his Gilded Age Newport palazzos, painted and made sketches along the Nile while his younger brother and Baker took photographs. (The results were later shown at a 1999 exhibition in Washington, D.C.)
Following their arduous journey, the pair of no-longer-neophyte photographers returned to Paris and made prints from their 18x24 cm negatives which were made using a waxed-paper process. Having developed the negatives, each man kept a personal album of the prints. The young Hunt showed his to the German naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who brought them to the attention of the King of Prussia, and Hunt made a formal gift of 11 prints to Karl Richard Lepsius, the German founder of the study of ancient Egyptology. Baker left his album with a New York dealer to discern commercial interest in the prints.
Following their extraordinary journey, the two men took divergent paths. Baker returned to Cincinnati, Ohio, to enjoy the life of a wealthy aesthete, while Hunt completed his studies at the Swiss Military Institute, then returned to America where he took a second law degree, this one from Harvard. He began practicing law in New York City, the home of his brother Richard Morris Hunt, until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he enlisted as lieutenant on the staff of General Heintzelman. Eventually he was promoted to lieutenant colonel for bravery at the Battle of Malvern Hill. Hunt subsequently attained the rank of full colonel and assistant adjutant general in the Union Army.
Following the Civil War, Leavitt Hunt returned to New York City and his law practice for several years, until he retired in 1867 to Weathersfield, Vermont, where his wife Katherine Jarvis had inherited the estate belonging to her father William Jarvis, a prominent Vermont businessman and diplomat best known as the first importer of Merino sheep into America.
Leavitt Hunt purchased his own estate at nearby Weathersfield Bow and became a gentleman farmer. Hunt was particularly interested in the rare breeds of Dutch cattle that he raised, as well as the white pine forests he propagated on his estate, which he dubbed "Elmsholme". During his retirement as a farmer, Hunt also became an inventor, with several patents for new plows.
As far as is known, neither Hunt nor his companion Baker ever showed much interest in the photographic medium after their journey. Their prints are rarely seen, very scarce, and are among the most valuable early photographic images. Hunt's personal album is now in the collection of the Bennington Art Museum, Bennington, Vermont. Baker's album evidently disappeared. The collection of photos presented to Egyptologist Richard Lepsius is housed at the Museum Ludwig's AgfaPhoto-Historama in Cologne, Germany. 
Hunt's personal negatives are believed lost, but the prints he made became the property of his brother Richard Morris Hunt. They are now preserved in the Richard Morris Hunt Papers at the American Architectural Foundation in Washington, D.C. A 1999 show at the American Architectural Foundation's Octagon Museum showcased Leavitt Hunt's 1853 journey. Entitled "A Voyage of Discovery: The Nile Journal of Richard Morris Hunt", the exhibition consisted of seventy of Leavitt Hunt's original photographic prints, as well as drawings and watercolors by Richard Morris Hunt from the museum's Prints and Drawings Collection.
Some of Leavitt Hunt's personal prints were donated by his family after his death to the Library of Congress, where they are part of the permanent photographic collection. There are also a few original prints from this early Middle East trip in the Hallmark Photographic Collection and at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. Harvard University's Harrison D. Horblit Collection of Early Photography also owns several of the works by Hunt and Baker.
Although Leavitt Hunt never returned to photography, he remained vitally interested in the arts until the end of his life, corresponding with fellow Harvard-educated lawyer and author Henry Dwight Sedgwick, as well as other intellectuals of the era. He and his wife travelled frequently, often crossing paths with family friends like Joseph Hodges Choate and Thomas Jefferson Coolidge. He also wrote poetry on the side.
Perhaps the highest tribute paid Leavitt Hunt and his brothers was that of Ralph Waldo Emerson. "The remarkable families", Emerson wrote, were "the three Jackson brothers...the three Lowell brothers...the four Lawrences...the Cabots...the three Hunts, William, Richard and Leavitt (William Hunt tells also of his brother John, in Paris); the Washburns, three governors, I believe."
Clyde du Vernet Hunt, who graduated from Andover and Harvard Law School, and subsequently became a painter and sculptor accepted by the Paris Salon, was the son of Leavitt Hunt and his wife, the former Katherine Jarvis. A portrait of Leavitt Hunt painted by his brother William Morris Hunt in 1874 is in the permanent collection of the Brooks Memorial Library, Brattleboro's main library. Jarvis Hunt, another son of Col. Hunt and his wife, became a noted Chicago architect.
Leavitt Hunt's wife Katherine, daughter of businessman William Jarvis, died June 6, 1916, at Lakewood, New Jersey, and was interred with her husband at Weathersfield. Leavitt Hunt predeceased his wife, dying at Weathersfield on February 16, 1907. The couple's infant son Morris Hunt, who died in 1871, is interred with his parents.

Newton Knight

Newton Knight (November 1837 – February 16, 1922) was an American farmer, soldier and Southern Unionist, best known as the leader of the Knight Company, a band of Confederate Army deserters that turned against the Confederacy during the Civil War. Local legends state that Knight and his men attempted to form the "Free State of Jones" in the area around Jones County, Mississippi, at the height of the war, though the exact nature of the Knight Company's opposition to the Confederate government is disputed. After the war, Knight aided Mississippi's Reconstruction government.
Knight has long been a controversial figure. Historians and descendants disagree over his motives and actions, with some arguing he was a noble and pious individual who refused to fight against a cause in which he did not believe, while others have portrayed him as a manipulative outlaw. This controversy was fueled in part by Knight's postwar marriage to a former slave, which effectively established a small mixed-race community in southeastern Mississippi.
The 1942 James H. Street novel, "Tap Roots", was inspired by Knight's actions in the Civil War. The novel was the basis for the 1948 film of the same name, which was directed by George Marshall.
Early life.
Knight was born in Jones County, Mississippi, in November 1837. There has been confusion over his age, as his son, Tom Knight, wrote that he was born in 1830, and his grandniece, Ethel Knight, stated he was born in 1829. Both Tom and Ethel Knight suggested Newton's mother, Mason, changed his year of birth to 1833 to protect him from legal repercussions after he killed a slave, though there is no evidence of this. The 1900 census states that Knight was born in November 1837, which is supported by census records from other years.
Newton was a grandson of John "Jackie" Knight (1773–1861), one of Jones County's largest slaveholders. Newton's father, Albert (1799–1862), however, did not own any slaves, and was the only child of Jackie Knight who did not inherit any. Newton, likewise, did not own any slaves. Newton has been described as a staunch Primitive Baptist, and unlike his father and grandfather, did not drink. He was probably taught to read and write by his mother.
Newton Knight married Serena Turner in 1858, and the two established a small farm just across the county line in Jasper County.
Civil War.
Knight, like many Jones Countians, was opposed to secession. The county elected John H. Powell, the "cooperation" (anti-secession) candidate, to represent them at Mississippi's secession convention in January 1861. Powell voted against secession on the first ballot, but, under pressure, switched his vote on the second ballot, joining the majority in voting to secede from the Union. In an interview many years later, Knight suggested many Jones Countians felt betrayed by Powell.
In spite of his opposition to secession, Knight enlisted in the Confederate Army in July 1861. He was given a discharge in January 1862, however, to return home and tend to his ailing father. In May 1862, Knight, along with a number of friends and neighbors, enlisted in Company F of the 7th Battalion, as they preferred to serve together in the same company, rather than with strangers.
Throughout the summer and fall of 1862, a number of factors prompted desertions by Jones Countians serving in the Confederate Army. One factor was the lack of food and supplies in the aftermath of the Siege of Corinth. Another involved reports of poor conditions back home, as small farms deteriorated from neglect. Knight was enraged when he received word that Confederate authorities had seized his family's horse. He was also outraged when the Confederate government passed the Twenty Negro Law, which allowed wealthy slaveowners and planters to avoid military service. Knight had also received word that his brother-in-law, Bill Morgan, who had become the head of the family in Knight's absence, was abusing his children.
Knight was reported AWOL in October 1862. He later defended his desertion, arguing, "if they had a right to conscript me when I didn't want to fight the Union, I had a right to quit when I got ready." After returning home, Knight, according to relatives, shot and killed Morgan. In early 1863, Knight was arrested and jailed, and possibly tortured, by Confederate authorities for desertion. His homestead and farm were destroyed, leaving his family destitute. In May 1863, he escaped.
As the ranks of deserters swelled in the aftermath of the Siege of Vicksburg, Confederate authorities began receiving reports that deserters in the Jones County area were looting houses. General Braxton Bragg dispatched Colonel Amos McLemore to Jones County to investigate and round up deserters and stragglers. On October 5, 1863, McLemore was shot and killed in the Ellisville home of Amos Deason, and Knight was believed to have pulled the trigger.
On October 13, 1863, the Knight Company, a band of deserters from Jones County and the adjacent counties of Jasper, Covington, Perry and Smith, was organized to protect the area from Confederate authorities. Knight was elected "captain" of the company, which included many of his relatives and neighbors. The company's main hideout, known as "Devils Den," was located along the Leaf River at the Jones-Covington county line. Local women and slaves provided food and other aid to the deserters. Women blew cattlehorns to signal the approach of Confederate authorities.
From late 1863 to early 1865, the Knight Company fought fourteen skirmishes with Confederate forces. One skirmish took place on December 23, 1863, at the home of Sally Parker, a Knight Company supporter, leaving one Confederate soldier dead and two badly wounded. During this same period, Knight led a raid into Paulding, where he and his men captured five wagonloads of corn, which they distributed among the local population. The company harassed Confederate officials, with numerous tax collectors, conscript officers, and other officials being reported killed in early 1864. In March 1864, the Jones County court clerk notified the governor that deserters had made tax collections in the county all but impossible.
While there is no direct evidence that Jones County officially seceded from the Confederacy, by the spring of 1864, the Confederate government in the county had been effectively overthrown. The American flag had been raised over the courthouse in Ellisville, and General William T. Sherman had received a letter from a local group declaring its independence from the Confederacy. In July 1864, the "Natchez Courier" erroneously reported that Jones County had seceded from the Confederacy.
General Leonidas Polk initially responded to the actions of the Knight Company by sending a contingent under Colonel Henry Maury into the area in February 1864. Maury reported he had cleared the area, but noted the deserters had threatened to obtain "Yankee aid" and return. Shortly afterward, Polk dispatched a veteran contingent of soldiers led by Colonel Robert Lowry, a future governor who would later describe Knight as an "ignorant and uneducated man." Using bloodhounds to track down deserters in the swamps, Lowry rounded up and executed ten members of the Knight Company, including Newton's cousins, Benjamin Franklin Knight and Sil Coleman. Newton Knight, however, evaded capture. He later stated his company had unsuccessfully attempted to break through Confederate lines to join the Union Army.
Reconstruction and later life.
At the end of the war, the Union Army tasked Knight with distributing food to struggling families in the Jones County area. He also led a raid that liberated several children who were still being held in slavery in a nearby county. Like many Southern Unionists, he supported the Republican Party, namely the Reconstruction administration of Governor Adelbert Ames. Knight was appointed U.S. Marshal in 1872, and was named Colonel of the First Infantry Regiment of Jasper County by Ames. After the Southern Democrats regained control of the state government, he withdrew from politics.
In 1870, Knight petitioned the federal government for compensation for several members of the Knight Company, including the ten who had been executed by Lowry in 1864. He provided sworn statements from several individuals attesting to his loyalty to the Union, including a local judge and a state senate candidate.
By the mid-1870s, Knight had separated from his wife, Serena, and had married Rachel, a former slave of his grandfather. During the same period, Knight's son, Mat, married Rachel's daughter, Fannie, and Knight's daughter, Molly, married Rachel's son, Jeff. Newton and Rachel Knight had several children before her death in 1889. Newton Knight died on February 16, 1922. In spite of a Mississippi law that barred the interment of whites and blacks in the same cemetery, he was buried next to Rachel on a hill overlooking their farm.
Legacy.
In 1935, Knight's son, Thomas Jefferson "Tom" Knight, published a book about his father, "The Life and Activities of Captain Newton Knight". Tom Knight portrayed his father as a Civil War-era Robin Hood who refused to fight for a cause with which he did not agree. The book noticeably omits Newton Knight's post-war marriage to Rachel.
The 1942 James H. Street novel, "Tap Roots", is loosely based on the Knight Company's actions. Though the book is a work of fiction, the novel's protagonist, Hoab Dabney, was inspired by Newton Knight. The book was the basis of the 1948 film, "Tap Roots", which was directed by George Marshall, and starred Van Heflin and Susan Hayward.
In the late 1940s, Davis Knight, a great-grandson of Newton and Rachel Knight, was charged with miscegeny for marrying a white woman. Much of the trial focused on the background of Rachel, namely whether or not she was actually black. Davis Knight was found guilty, but the verdict was eventually overturned by the Mississippi Supreme Court.
In 1951, Knight's grandniece, Ethel Knight, published "The Echo of the Black Horn", a scathing denunciation of Knight and the Knight Company. Dedicating the book to the Confederate veterans of Jones County, Ethel Knight portrayed Newton as a backward, ignorant, murderous traitor. She argued that most members of the Knight Company were not Unionists, but had been manipulated by Knight into joining his cause.
During the latter half of the 20th century, much of the debate over the Knight Company shifted to whether or not Jones County was truly a pro-Union stronghold. In his 1984 book, "The Legend of the Free State of Jones", Rudy Leverett argued that the Knight Company's actions were not representative of Jones County, and provided evidence that a majority of Jones Countians were loyal to the Confederacy.
In 2003, historian Victoria Bynum's book "The Free State of Jones" was published by the University of North Carolina Press. This book provides a broader view of the Knight Company, taking into account the economic, religious and genealogical factors that helped shape the views of Civil War-era residents of the Jones County area. Bynum provides numerous examples of Knight stating his pro-Union sentiments after the war, and notes the influence of the staunchly pro-Union Collins family, many of whom were members of the Knight Company. She also brings to light the many women and slaves who provided assistance to Knight and his men.
In 2010, Sally Jenkins and John Stauffer published "The State of Jones", which elaborates on Knight's pro-Union sympathies, and suggests his views on race played a role in his actions during and after the war.

Deadman (Vertigo)

Deadman is a supernatural comic book series written by Bruce Jones and published by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics. The series was very loosely based on the DC superhero character Deadman, although the similarities between the properties are few. The series lasted for 13 issues.
Plot.
Airline pilot Brandon Cayce is killed when a plane he is on crashes. However, Cayce utterly refuses to pass on into death, and resurrects to a sort of half-life, but finds himself experiencing visions of what seem to be other realities and timelines. He meets with Sarah, his former lover and also the pregnant widow of his brother Scott, and tells her that they are being pursued by men who wish to gain possession of her unborn child. Brandon discovers that his brother had been possessed by an entity named "Devlin" while the child was being conceived, and Devlin has abducted the fetus and implanted it in the body of another woman, named Eve. Devlin's agents imprison Eve while waiting for her newfound pregnancy to come to term. Eventually, Eve gives birth to a being Devlin claims is the next step in human evolution, which will be the first human with a complete awareness of other dimensions. After giving birth, Eve is killed by her husband, although Sarah shows up and absconds with what had formerly been her baby. Attempting to reacquire the child, Devlin proposes a bargain to Brandon: take the life of the baby, in exchange for the continued lives of Brandon and Sarah. If Brandon refuses this deal, he will die. Nobly, Brandon chooses death to allow Sarah and the child to live free.
Collected editions.
Only the first five issues have been released in trade paperback, under the title "Deadman: Deadman Walking" (ISBN 1-40121-236-0).

<doc id="19656353" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19656353" title="Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)">
Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)

In Greek and Roman mythology, Glaucus (, "Glaukos") was a son of Sisyphus whose main myth involved his violent death as the result of his horsemanship. He was a king of Corinth and the subject of a lost tragedy by Aeschylus, "Glaucus Potnieus" "(Glaucus at Potniae)", fragments of which are contained in an Oxyrhynchus Papyrus.
The myth and its variants.
Glaucus took part in the funeral games organized in honour of Pelias by his son Acastus, the famous "Athla epi Pelia" in which some of the foremost heroes of Greece competed, including the Argonauts. Glaucus lost to Iolaus in the chariot race. A fragment from Aeschylus's tragedy has sometimes been taken to mean that Glaucus died in a chariot accident on the way home, but it seems more probable that the accident occurred during the race. According to Pausanias, Glaucus haunted the Isthmian Games as a form of Taraxippus, because he was killed by his horses during the funeral games.
There are two main traditions concerning the death of Glaucus. In one, he feeds his mares on human flesh in order to make them fierce in battle, but at the games he has no supply for them, and they turn on their master and devour him instead. Servius, however, regards Glaucus as a doublet of Hippolytus: he offended the goddess Aphrodite (Venus) either by keeping his mares from mating in order to preserve their speed, or by scorning her in general. The goddess then brings retribution upon him through his horses. In other sources, the mares are driven into their man-killing frenzy by consuming either an herb in their Boeotian pasture at Potniae or water from a toxic well. Gilbert Murray saw Hippolytus, Glaucus and their ilk as undergoing "sparagmos" as vegetation deities.
In the "Georgics", Vergil casts the neglect of Venus as preventing the mares from mating. That the Romans considered mating a hazard of horse husbandry is indicated by a strange anecdote from Vergil's older contemporary Varro: when a stallion kept refusing to mate, the handler succeeded by covering its head; when uncovered, the stallion attacked him and killed him by biting.
Genealogy.
The mother of Glaucus was Merope, a daughter of Atlas and one of the Pleiades. By marrying Sisyphus, she became the only one of her sister Pleiades to mate with a mortal.
At first Sisyphus had tried to arrange a marriage for Glaucus with the shape-shifting Mestra, a daughter of Erysichthon, but despite the payment of valuable bride-gifts, she eluded the marriage and was taken to an island by Poseidon. Glaucus then married a daughter of Nisus named Eurymede or Eurynome. Zeus had declared that Glaucus would sire no children even by his own wife, perhaps because of his violations against Aphrodite. While Eurynome gave birth to the famed hero Bellerophon, Poseidon is usually seen as the true father. The "Iliad", however, names Glaucus as Bellerophon's father. The equine theme continues: Poseidon was associated with horses, and Bellerophon was the rider of the winged horse Pegasus.
Glaucus succeeded Sisyphus to the throne of Ephyra, the city he had built, which later became Corinth. He was the ancestor of the Glaucus in the "Iliad".

Mac Cummings

MacLaren (Mac) Thompson Cummings (born January 23, 1979) is an American entrepreneur and Democratic political fundraiser. Cummings served as the Director of Internet Finance during Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid of 2008.
Education.
Cummings was raised in Tully, New York. He attended Manlius Pebble Hill High School in DeWitt, NY. After graduating from high school, Cummings attended Cornell University, where he received his Bachelor of Science degree from the School of Industrial and Labor Relations in 2001. Today, Cummings lives in Syracuse.
Professional life.
Cummings launched Mindshark Software and Consulting from his Cornell University dorm room in 1998 and served as CEO, guiding the company to profitability in its first year. Cummings led Mindshark to several notable software agreements with high-profile clients such as Forbes, Siebert Financial, and General Electric.
Cummings co-founded Terakeet Corporation in 2000, and also became co-owner and investor in US Beverage Net, which develops technologies to monitor beverage consumption in restaurants and bars across the United States. Since the company's inception, the draft technology has been installed in national chains such as Hooters, Uno Chicago Grill,and Buffalo Wild Wings. In July 2008, the draft beer flow-meter technology was installed in Cask 'n Flagon, a landmark location for diehard Boston Red Sox fans.
Much of Cummings's interest in the industry is based on the efforts to streamline the customer service experience as much as possible, not only for large call centers, but medium-sized businesses who seek the efficiency of automation.
Cummings is a founding shareholder in five businesses. In 2004 Cummings co-founded CD Technology Partners, a firm rooted in early stage technologies and ideas..
Politics.
Cummings is active in local and national politics and has often been consulted for fundraising strategies on the technology and web side of campaigns.
Most recently, Cummings served as Director of Internet Finance for Hillary Clinton’s historic presidential bid from February to June 2008. As an integral cog to Clinton’s fundraising resurgence in the winter of 2008, Cummings is credited with being part of the largest single day of online fundraising ($10 million in 24 hours) in American presidential campaign history. 
Director of Internet Finance (Hillary Clinton Presidential Bid 2008).
Cummings was first sought out by the Hillary Clinton campaign by campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe on July 9, 2008 after organizing a $215,000 fundraiser in Syracuse, McAuliffe’s home town. After initially working as a satellite consultant, Cummings joined the Hillary Clinton campaign in Arlington, Virginia, as an unpaid volunteer in February.
Clinton's fundraising, which had lagged behind Barack Obama's, began to improve soon after Cummings joined the campaign in February. Clinton’s online fundraising began to account for nearly 75% of her monthly totals, mainly in small contributions. In February, the campaign raised $30 million of its $35 million monthly total online, the single largest fundraising month for the campaign. Contributions averaged $100 during this period, and nearly 25% of all contributions were from new donors.
Political bloggers were frequently critical of Cummings during the campaign, alleging that he had effectively turned the Internet into an ATM for campaign finance.
Cummings is said to have financed his participation in the campaign himself and received no compensation from the campaign after it was suspended in June.

<doc id="19656637" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19656637" title="Eduardo Salvio">
Eduardo Salvio

Eduardo Antonio "Toto" Salvio (born 13 July 1990) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for S.L. Benfica in Portugal, mainly as a right winger.
Club career.
Lanús.
Salvio was born in Avellaneda, a port city in the province of Buenos Aires. At only 17, he was promoted to the first team of Club Atlético Lanús for the 2007 Apertura, but did not appear in any games in the tournament as the "Granate" finished in top position.
Salvio made his debut for Lanús' first team on 24 August 2008, in a game against Boca Juniors. He scored his first goal(s) for the club in a 4–2 win against Argentinos Juniors, exactly two months later. Overall, he netted nine goals in the season as the team finished fourth overall, and was also its joint-leading goal scorer, along with José Sand.
On 19 August 2009 Salvio scored twice in the first leg of Lanús' first stage Copa Sudamericana match, netting two late goals to help his team come from behind to defeat Club Atlético River Plate (2–1 away win, 3–1 on aggregate). In early January of the following year, after months of speculation, he signed for Atlético Madrid in Spain, for a reported transfer fee of €10 million.
Atlético Madrid.
Salvio made his official debut for Atlético in a UEFA Europa League game against Galatasaray SK on 18 February 2010, and scored his first goals for the "Colchoneros" in a 3–1 La Liga home win against CD Tenerife on 25 April. On 12 May he appeared as a substitute in the Europa League final against Fulham, coming on as a substitute for José Antonio Reyes in the 76th minute of the 2–1 win.
On 19 August 2010, after speculation linked him to several clubs, mostly in Spain but also in Portugal, S.L. Benfica and Atlético Madrid agreed on a season-long loan for Salvio, with the Lisbon club also buying 20% of his rights for €2.5 million. On 18 December he opened his goal scoring for the "Reds", scoring twice in a 5–2 home win against Rio Ave FC.
After a relatively slow start to Portuguese football, Salvio became a regular fixture for Benfica in the second part of the campaign, partnering several compatriots in the squad and usually appearing as a right winger. On 20 February 2011 he scored the first goal in a 2–0 away win against city rivals Sporting Clube de Portugal and, three days later, he netted his first goal in European competition, with an impressive 20-yard strike against German side VfB Stuttgart in the Europa League's round-of-32 (2–0 away success, 4–1 on aggregate); to finalize that week, in a home league match against C.S. Marítimo, he scored the equalizer minutes after the away side opened the scoring, in an eventual 2–1 home win, and finished the campaign with 39 official games and ten successful strikes.
Salvio officially returned to Atlético on 19 May to begin his rehabilitation on a calf injury sustained whilst still at Benfica, in a Europa League game against PSV Eindhoven. He continued to be regularly played by both Gregorio Manzano and his successor, compatriot Diego Simeone.
In March 2012, in two games separated by only five days, Salvio scored three goals: he started with a rare header to put the visitors ahead at Sevilla FC, in an eventual 1–1 draw, then added a brace in a 3–1 home win against Beşiktaş J.K. for the season's Europa League.
Benfica return.
On 31 July 2012, Benfica and Atlético agreed on Salvio transferring permanently to the Portuguese for five years, for a club record €13.5 million – surpassing the previous record of €13 million paid to FC Barcelona to acquire the services of Simão Sabrosa in 2001.
On 31 August 2013, late into the first half of a local derby at Sporting, Salvio suffered a severe anterior cruciate ligament injury to his right knee, going on to miss several months. It was the second serious physical ailment the player had in only two years, the first in his foot also at the service of the Portuguese.
International career.
In January 2009, Salvio was selected to join the Argentina under-20 squad for the 2009 South American Youth Championship in Venezuela. The national team underperformed in the championship, failing to qualify to the that year's FIFA U-20 World Cup, thus being unable to defend its 2007 title.
On 20 May 2009, aged 18, Salvio made his full international debut in a friendly match with Panama. The Argentine side, made up of players based in the Argentine Primera División, won it 3–1.

6.5-284 Norma

The 6.5-284 Norma originated as a wildcat cartridge based on the .284 Winchester cartridge necked down to 6.5 mm.
History.
The .284 Winchester was created around 1963, but never really caught on, except as a parent case for the wildcat 6.5mm-284. The 6.5 caliber allowed for the use of long, aerodynamic bullets. In 1999, Norma submitted it to CIP. It has since been standardized as the "6.5mm-284 Norma".
Use.
It has been used extensively in benchrest competitions and is known as an extremely accurate long range round. Using an improved version of the 6.5/284, Rich DeSimone set a world record at . Rich DeSimone's record has been broken by Tom Sarver in 2007 using a .300 Hulk wildcat cartridge that is based on the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge. In contrast, most hunting rifles do the same at to .

Louise Berger

Louise Berger was a Latvian anarchist, a member of the Anarchist Red Cross and editor of Emma Goldman's "Mother Earth Bulletin" in New York. Berger became well known outside anarchist circles in 1914 after a premature bomb explosion at her New York City apartment (known as the Lexington Avenue bombing), which killed four persons and destroyed part of the building.
Early life.
Berger was born in Latvia, Russia in the 1890s. Around 1905, she left Russia for Western Europe. In Hamburg, Germany she met two other Latvian Anarchist Red Cross members, Charles Berg and Carl Hanson (her stepbrother), and accompanied them to New York City in 1911. When the three arrived in New York, the three joined the Lettish (Latvian) Anarchist Group, an organization primarily devoted to the publication and dissemination of anarchist literature. However, when a number of comrades organized a Lettish Anarchist Red Cross in December 1913, the three became some of its first members.
Tarrytown and the Lexington Avenue Bombing.
During this same period, Berger, Berg, and Hanson also became active in anarchist labor rights groups and the Anti-Military League. Most of these organizations used the Ferrer Center at their hub for activities. Here individuals like Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, Luigi Galleani, and members of the Anarchist Red Cross and the Industrial Workers of the World spent a great deal of their time. During these meetings, plans were made to stage protests at the Tarrytown, New York estate of Standard Oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, owner of the Ludlow mines in Colorado.
The Ludlow Massacre in Colorado and police dispersal of the Tarrytown protests enraged most radicals. In June, members of the Lettish Anarchist Red Cross, including Berg, Hanson, Berger, and IWW member Arthur Caron began plotting a bomb attack to assassinate Rockefeller.
Berg, Hanson, and Caron began to collect dynamite from various sources, storing it in Louise Berger's apartment on New York's Lexington Avenue. Meetings were held at the Ferrer Center, where the conspirators devised a plan in which Berg, Hanson, and Caron would to plant a bomb at Rockefeller's home in Tarrytown. The plot was scheduled for July 3, but for reasons unknown, the plan was called off at the last moment. The three men returned to Berger's apartment from Tarrytown with bomb in hand.
At 9 a.m. on July 4, 1914, Louise Berger left her apartment and walked to the office of the Anarchist newspaper known as the Mother Earth Bulletin, where she worked as an editor alongside Alexander Berkman. It has been assumed by some who knew her that Berger was going there to inform Berkman that the bomb had been readjusted and was ready. At 9:15 an explosion occurred from Berger's apartment at 1626 Lexington Avenue. Passers-by witnessed a shower of debris and rubble fall into the street. Jack Isaacson, a newspaper editor who lived around the corner from Berger, recalled a man's arm falling from the Lexington Avenue building into the street in front of him. The three upper floors of the building were wrecked, while debris showered rooftops and the streets below. Large pieces of furniture were thrown hundreds of feet in the air due to the power of the blast.
The bomb had exploded prematurely, killing Carl Hanson, Charles Berg and Arthur Caron. A fourth person, Marie Chavez, was also killed. The blast threw Caron's body onto the mangled and twisted fire escape. The mutilated bodies of Marie Chavez and Hanson were found inside of the apartment. The blast had torn the body of Charles Berg into pieces, which were seen by spectators being thrown through the air onto the streets. In total, twenty other people were injured, seven of them severely enough to be hospitalized. Another man, an IWW member named Mike Murphy, was spending the night in the apartment, when the explosion occurred. Berkman and Berger attended the men's funerals. Berkman would later state that the Lexington Avenue explosion was the most meaningful anarchist event since the Haymarket riot. On July 20, 1914 Berger and two other women visited jailed hunger striker Rebecca Edelsohn, who was protesting her confinement for failure to pay a $300 fine for speaking disrespectfully of the American flag.
The "Manifesto" and life in Soviet Russia.
Louise Berger remained active in the United States anarchist movement for three more years. In 1917, after the October Revolution in Russia, she decided to leave the United States to return to her homeland and assist in the worker’s revolution. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman had recently finished compiling a communique to their comrades in Russia titled "Manifesto to the Russian Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers!" to explain the state of the U.S. antiwar movement, in particular the recent imprisonment of Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings, convicted of the Preparedness Day bombings of 1916. Goldman and Berkman entrusted Louise Berger, (according to Goldman, one of "our closest and most dependable friends") with a copy of the manifesto to take with her on her journey to Russia. Berger sailed from New York in August 1917 bound for Russia, along with journalist John Reed and several other prominent radicals. On the voyage out she met another returnee, Senya Fleshin, and became his lover.
Back in Russia, Berger and Fleshin rejoined other anarchists participating in the revolution. She eventually parted with Fleshin and traveled to Odessa, where she reportedly carried out “bank expropriations” as an armed robber ("naletchiki") during the chaos of the Revolution. According to one source, she fell ill and died during the typhus epidemic that swept Russia in 1920 and 1921. Another source claims that she was liquidated along with other anarchists by Bolshevik Cheka or Red Army security forces during the Trotskyist campaign against 'anarcho-bandits' and other dissident movements.

Edward C. Elmore

Edward Carrington Elmore (about 1826 – death date unknown) served as the Treasurer of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. His signature appears on collectible Confederate currency, and he designed several of the Confederacy's coins.
Biography.
Elmore was a well educated native of Columbia, South Carolina. He was a descendant of General John Archer Elmore. He received his education at South Carolina College. He became a prominent banker and married the daughter of a prominent family, Caroline Elizabeth Sims, on April 7, 1852. Shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War, he moved to Montgomery, Alabama
Shortly after the creation of the Confederacy, President Jefferson Davis recommended Elmore as its first treasurer, a decision endorsed by the Secretary of the Treasury Christopher Memminger and ratified by the Provisional Confederate Congress. He took office on March 6, 1861. In his official capacity, Elmore had to receive, count, keep, and disburse government funds in cooperation with the Congress and other agencies. All requisitions drawn upon the national treasury had first to pass Elmore's inspection before they could assume the form of executive warrants. Even a warrant approved by the Comptroller and sanctioned by the Memminger was subject to Elmore's review before being paid.
Memminger resigned his post as Secretary of the Treasury on July 18, 1864, and was replaced by fellow South Carolinian George Trenholm. However, Elmore initially stayed on as Treasurer under Trenholm.
In August 1864, Elmore accused John M. Daniels, the controversial editor of the Richmond "Examiner", of slandering him by accusing Elmore and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin of gambling away government funds at a private club. When no retraction was forthcoming from the newspaperman, Elmore demanded a duel. The two opponents met on Belle Isle, and Elmore wounded Daniels with his first shot. One sympathetic former soldier later wrote, "The result of this duel occasioned as many hearty congratulations among the true Confederates in Richmond as if it had been the announcement of a victory by General Lee over the Federal army."
Shortly afterward, Elmore resigned his position as Treasurer and was replaced by John N. Hendren on October 10, 1864.

Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver

Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. 164 (1994), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held private plaintiffs may not maintain aiding and abetting suit under Securities Exchange Act § 10(b).
The majority opinion in the case established that liability did not extend to “aiders or abettors” that participate in misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale of securities. The Supreme Court held that "private civil liability under Rule 10b-5 does not extend to those who do not engage in a manipulative or deceptive practice but who aid and abet such a violation of 10(b)." This distinguished between the primary liability of violators of Rule 10b-5 and non-primary defendants, who had not directly deceived investors. This was a more literal reading than hitherto of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 10b-5, which prohibit fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
The Supreme Court's ruling reversed a long history of court decisions and SEC enforcement actions where aiders and abettors, often banks, accountants, trustees, and attorneys, were found liable under Rule 10b-5. The case makes the distinction between primary violators, who directly misstate or omit material facts that are relied upon by investors, and aiders and abettors. According to the court: “A plaintiff must show reliance on the defendant's misstatement or omission to recover under 10b-5. "Basic Inc. v. Levinson", supra, at 243. Were we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case, the defendant could be liable without any showing that the plaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor's statement or actions. . . .". When investors relied on such statements or actions, the court extends Rule 10b-5 liability to these secondary participants. The Court stated that "any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5. . .."

The 1992 Ukrainian Cup Final is a football match that took place at the Republican Stadium on May 31, 1992. The match was the 1st Ukrainian Cup Final and it was contested by FC Chornomorets Odessa and FC Metalist Kharkiv. The 1992 Ukrainian Cup Final was the first to be held in the Ukrainian capital Kiev. Chornomorets won the match 1:0 on the silver goal rule when the Illya Tsymbalar's 107' goal gave the Odessa club the win during the extra time.
The match also had 1 yellow card issued to "Kastorny" (Metalist).
Road to Kiev.
Six Ukrainian Premier League clubs that competed last year in the Soviet Supreme League started from the second round (1/8) of which included both Chornomorets and Metalist.
The two teams had some difficulties along the way. "Chornomorets" surprisingly lost its first game in Zhytomyr to Polissya 1:4 (!), but reinstated themselves in the return leg with a colossal 7:1 win. Then had to visit Zaporizhia two rounds in a row before qualifying for this final. "Metalist" came to the final after defeating Shakhtar in the semi-finals and were considered able to repeat their previous Soviet achievement by earning another national trophy.

William Spade

William Spade (born September 12, 1962) is an American criminal defense attorney in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His clients have included Corey Kemp, the former Treasurer of the City of Philadelphia, who was prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice for honest services fraud, Julius Murray, a private social worker, charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of 14-year-old Danieal Kelly, who was allegedly starved to death by her mother, Andrea Kelly, and Kevin Felder, who was charged with capital murder in the shooting death of five-year-old Casha'e Rivers, but ultimately cleared.
Background.
Spade was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He graduated from Northeast High School (Oakland Park, Florida), in 1980, received his bachelor's degree from Brandeis University in 1984 and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Chicago Law School in 1990. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1990, and practiced for four years at the law firm of Dechert Price & Rhoads. He clerked for the Honorable Eduardo C. Robreno of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 1994-95, before working for ten years as a prosecutor with the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office. In 2004, Spade opened his criminal defense practice.
Grand Jury Investigation Into The Sexual Abuse of Minors by Priests in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.
Spade was a lead prosecutor in the Philadelphia District Attorney's grand jury investigation into the sexual abuse of minors by priests in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Known within the office as the God Squad, a group of prosecutors and detectives spent two years reviewing the Philadelphia Archdiocese's secret archives file which documented decades of sexual abuse of children by Philadelphia priests. Exhausted, emotionally drained, and frustrated by the refusal of his superiors to indict members of the Church hierarchy, Spade resigned his position in the fall of 2004, a year before the investigation concluded, and opened a criminal defense practice.
Notable cases.
United States v. Robert Merritt, Jr..
Spade represented Robert Merritt, Jr., who was accused of being an associate of the ruthless Philadelphia drug kingpin, Kaboni Savage. Merritt faced six capital murder charges related to the October 9, 2004 firebombing of the home of Eugene Coleman that killed six people, Coleman was another associate of Savage's who became a government cooperator and testified against Savage in a 2005 drug conspiracy case. The firebombing was allegedly retaliation for Coleman's testimony. After a six-month trial in 2013 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania presided over by the Honorable R. Barclay Surrick, Merritt was convicted of racketeering but was acquitted of all six capital murder charges. 
United States v. Corey Kemp.
Spade represented Corey Kemp, the former Treasurer of the City of Philadelphia, in one of the longest and most complex public corruption trials in the history of Philadelphia. Kemp grew up fatherless in a North Philadelphia ghetto, became an all-City basketball player, attended college on a basketball scholarship, obtained an MBA, and was appointed Treasurer at the age of 35, the youngest person ever appointed to the post.
In 2003, the FBI began a wire-tap of Kemp's phones as well as the phones of Ron White, an influential fund-raiser for Mayor John F. Street, who represented investment banks seeking City bond business. The FBI also attempted to bug the office of Mayor John Street, but was unsuccessful when the bug was discovered. Soon after, the U.S. Attorney's office indicted Kemp and White charging them with honest services fraud involving a scheme to steer City bond business to banks who contributed to the re-election campaign of Mayor Street.
United States v. Joseph Moderski.
Spade represented Joseph C. Moderski, a business consultant, who because of his political connections, was known as the go-to guy for companies looking to do business with the City of Philadelphia. Moderski was prosecuted in federal court for his part in an influence-peddling scheme related to contracts at Philadelphia International Airport. He pleaded guilty and received a sentence of 14 months imprisonment.
United States v. Joseph Logue.
Spade represented Joseph Logue, a former Philadelphia police officer, who was charged with mail fraud and money laundering in connection with a scheme to defraud members of the posh Whitemarsh Valley Country Club out of $2 million. Logue pleaded guilty and at sentencing Spade put forward extensive evidence that Logue, a decorated Vietnam Marine helicopter tailgunner, suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, which caused an uncontrollable compulsion to engage in highly risky behavior such as the fraud scheme. Logue was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment, which was significantly above the Guidelines range sentence he faced at the beginning of the case.
United States v. Joseph Davis.
Spade represented Joseph Davis, a rap artist and producer who ran a studio called 88 Breaks and promoted concerts by rap artists such as Run-D.M.C. and Biggie Smalls. Davis pleaded guilty to tampering with a cooperating government witness by having fliers identifying the witness as a "snitch" and a "rat" placed on telephone poles and car windshields in his West Philadelphia neighborhood. Davis pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment.
Scholarly writing.
Spade was an early advocate for the abolition of the so-called "100:1 ratio" which punished criminal defendants convicted of crack cocaine offenses much more harshly than those convicted of powder cocaine offenses. The disparate treatment effected by this law was particularly egregious because the result was to punish African-American defendants more harshly than white defendants. Spade's Aizona Law Review article advocating a decrease in the 100:1 ratio was cited in the testimony before the United States Sentencing Commission of Irwin H. Schwartz, President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) in which Schwartz urged a reform of the cocaine sentencing laws. Eleven years later, Spade was proven correct when the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts were not constrained to impose the 100:1 ratio when sentencing defendants in crack cocaine cases if they found that the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. Spade's article was cited in the "Amicus Curiae" Brief of the NAACP's Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc. filed with the Supreme Court in the Kimbrough case.

Absolution (novel)

Absolution is a novel by Olaf Olafsson about the mind of a man haunted by the crime he planned half a century earlier.
Synopsis.
When he died, Peter Peterson left behind the trappings of a seemingly charmed life: a vast fortune, two children, and a stately Park Avenue address. But he left something else behind: a sheaf of confessions about a dark period of his youth. In pages written weeks before his death, he reveals a crime of passion, committed in the throes of unrequited love, that has burdened him for his entire life. Yet as he finishes his story, he encounters a surprise that will shake the very foundation of his past. Spanning a boyhood in Iceland to the Nazi occupation of Denmark to a cunning business career in modern-day Manhattan, Absolution echoes Dostoevsky and Ibsen as it masterfully plumbs the darkest corners of a sinister mind and a wounded heart.
Critical Reception.
“Compulsive reading, and the spare, dry language concentrates the suspense…As cold and lucid as a quartz crystal.” – The Independent on Sunday (UK)
