List of Ultras of Central America

The following is a sortable table of the 22 ultra-prominent mountain peaks of Central America. This article defines Central America as the seven nations of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.
Topographic elevation is the vertical distance above the reference geoid, a precise mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface. Topographic prominence is the elevation difference between the summit and the highest or key col to a higher summit. Topographic isolation is the minimum great circle distance to a point of higher elevation.
This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least 100 meters (328.1 feet) of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least 500 meters (1640.4 feet) of topographic prominence. An ultra-prominent summit is a summit with at least 1500 meters (4921.3 feet) of topographic prominence.
Of these 22 ultra-prominent summits of Central America, 7 are located in Honduras, 6 in Guatemala, 4 in El Salvador, 3 in Costa Rica, 2 in Nicaragua, and 1 in Panama. Cerro El Pital straddles the border between Honduras and El Salvador.

Painted Skin (2008 film)

Painted Skin is a 2008 supernatural-fantasy film directed by Gordon Chan, starring Donnie Yen, Chen Kun, Zhou Xun, Zhao Wei, Betty Sun and Qi Yuwu. Although the film is based partly on a supernatural premise, it is more of an action-romance than a horror film. "Painted Skin" is based, very loosely, on one of Pu Songling's classic short stories in "Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio". The theme song of the film, "Huà Xīn" (畫心; "Painted Heart"), was performed by Jane Zhang.
Plot.
The film is set sometime in between the late Qin Dynasty and early Han Dynasty. Xiaowei is a fox spirit who feasts on human hearts in order to maintain her lovely, youthful appearance. When General Wang Sheng rescues her from a band of Xiongnu and brings her home, trouble brews as the demon falls in love with the general, who is married to Peirong.
Another older love triangle is present, between Pang Yong, Wang Sheng and Peirong. Pang Yong is a former general who was in love with Peirong, but eventually lost her to Wang Sheng. Peirong asks Pang Yong for help as she suspects Xiao Wei for what she really is. Pang is aided by an inexperienced "demon hunter", a young female fighter called Xia Bing. Hints of a developing relationship between Xia and Pang are there, although this is never fully explored. Another subplot revolves around Xiaowei's demon ally, Xiaoyi, who is actually morphed from a chameleon, and who also has unreciprocated feelings for Xiaowei and helps her obtain all the human hearts she needs to maintain her human "skin", who many a time almost got caught by Wang's soldiers, thus enraging Xiaowei into chasing him off despite his pleas and advice that a love between demon and human is impossible and to let him stay by her side.
One night, Peirong finds out about Xiaowei's true self and form when she undresses and peels off her human skin right in front of her. Horrified at her findings, she tries again and again to tell Wang of Xiaowei's true nature, but he brushes them off as being tired and tells her to rest more. Peirong goes back to Xiaowei's residence and confronts her. Xiao Wei tells Peirong that she wants to be Madam Wang, and tells her to back down. Peirong makes Xiaowei swear that she won't feast on another human's heart in order to be youthful and love Wang Sheng faithfully until they are aged. Xiaowei agrees and forces Peirong to drink a potion which would make her the 'demon' while she becomes Madam Wang. After drinking the potion, Peirong's hair and skin turned white like Xiaowei's true form and in order to keep her promise, she runs away from Wang residence while everyone thinks she is the demon. Pang Yong comes and rescues Peirong just as she is about to die and together with Xia Bing, they run off to a nearby mountain's cave and hide there. 
Xia Bing recounts her grandfather's experience that the color white is the most fatal form of demon's poison, and the whiter Peirong becomes, the closer she is to death. Wang Sheng arrives with his soldiers and Xiaowei with her maidservants, who all want to kill Peirong. Wang Sheng shouts to his soldiers that he will kill her himself if she really is the demon. Tearfully, Wang Sheng asks Peirong if she really killed humans and if she really is the demon, all of which she answers yes tearfully. Wang Sheng announces that even if she is a demon, she is his Peirong, and she is still his wife. Smiling, Peirong impales herself with a dagger Wang Sheng was holding and dies in his embrace. Xiaowei tries to gain Wang Sheng's affection by getting closer to him, but he only cries sadly while holding on to Peirong's body. At that moment, Xiaowei realizes that no matter what she does, Wang Sheng will never truly love her in return.
Heartbroken, Pang Yong shouted to the entire troupe that Xiao Wei is the real demon, not Peirong, and he proves it by trying to slash Xiaowei but cannnot since Xiaowei's body is as hard as steel. Pang Yong almost is defeated when Wang Sheng comes towards Xiao Wei. He kneels down in front of her and tearfully begs her to bring Peirong back to life. Xiaowei, heartbroken, asks Wang Sheng what would she get if she returns her to life, and Wang Sheng tells her that he loves Xiaowei, but he already has Peirong, and kills himself. Xiaowei screams her heart out and her skin whitens to her demon form but her hair still remains black. Xiaowei willingly gives Wang Sheng her vast magical strength and energy in the form of a small sphere, but before she can restore Wang Sheng to life, her demon ally the chameleon comes and snatches it from her, reprimanding her for her willingness to sacrifice her power which she had cultivated for thousands of years. He swallows it and tells her that he is going to take her back home. 
Pang Yong and Xia Bing fight the chameleon, and at last, Xia Bing draws out a demon slaying sword and kills the chameleon, but not before the chameleon kills Pang Yong. Xiaowei tearfully gathers two of the glowing power spheres, one hers while the other the chameleon's. She crushes it and Peirong and Wang Sheng come back to life. Everyone in the cave who had died are brought back to life as well, including Pang Yong. 
In the ending credits, Xiaowei is shown manifested in her white fox form without any special abilities, having given up her cultivated abilities from thousands of years to return Peirong and Wang Sheng to life.

Looking Glass (series)

The Looking Glass, or Voyage of the Space Bubble, series is a military hard science fiction novel series created by author John Ringo and centering around the creation of trans-space portals known as "looking glasses" (due to their mirror-like appearance) and the effect their discovery and the discovery of things via the portals have on life on Earth and off it. Ringo wrote the first book in the series alone, and has collaborated with physicist and author Travis S. Taylor beginning with the second book in the series.
Series basis.
This series begins with the cataclysmic creation of a system for opening portals to other places in this universe. Alien contacts and conflicts (both friendly and non) form the basis of the story and provide a look at the idea that being a hero requires more than just muscles and guns. 
Into the Looking Glass.
At the beginning of "Into the Looking Glass", a scientist named Chen attempts a limited modification of the laws of physics in a given area. That area being the particle accelerator in the University of Central Florida's high energy physics department. It is suspected he succeeds as the result is a 60 kt blast and the creation of something known as the 'Chen Anomaly', an enigmatic black sphere that functions as a portal to another world.
Having heard about the blast in Florida, the Secretary of Defense - going to brief the president - grabs the nearest scientist with any qualifications on the matter who happens to be Dr. William Weaver (modeled on Sci-Fi author Travis S Taylor), a self-proclaimed High-Tech Redneck from Huntsville, Alabama. Dr. Weaver finds himself, along with SEAL Chief Todd Miller, becoming the lead investigators and trouble-shooters relating to the Chen Anomaly and the 'Looking Glass' portals it spawns. When one begins to spew a hostile alien biological entity it's up to a Geek and a Jock to save not only this world but literally hundreds of others.
Book 2 - Vorpal Blade.
In dealing with the Looking Glasses, humanity has discovered precisely one friendly species. The Adar. About a hundred years in advance of humanity, the Adar have had all sorts of problems with the hostile entity known as the Dreen and their slave races. With the discovery of an ally in Humanity they look forward to a brighter future. As a gift, they offer Humanity a small black box that they discovered on a distant world. Enigmatic and plain, the box appears to be a terrifying weapon until Dr. William Weaver discovers that it is in fact a hyperdrive which, when grafted to the former SSBN Nebraska creates the first Warp Ship, the Alliance Space Ship Vorpal Blade.
Vorpal Blade tells the story of Humanity's first voyage into interstellar space and the hazards we encounter there. Be they the Mecha-eating Crabpus, the gravitational standing waves between solar systems or the Demons of Cheerick the crew, Marines and SF contingent of the Vorpal Blade must handle them all... Just as soon as they quit heaving from the pink maulk in the pre-mission physical.
Book 3 - Manxome Foe.
An astronomy center located on another planet reachable through the Looking Glass portals was attacked and destroyed, presumably by the Dreen. As per protocol an Ardune warhead was sent through the gate destabilizing it. Now the crew of the Vorpal Blade must find out what happened, if it was Dreen, and are they colonizing the local systems. Despite the fact that it takes a month to get there with pre-mission physical in route. The crew is put up against unimaginable odds, making a new ally, and discovering the Dreen's plan for Earth.
Book 4 - Claws That Catch.
During their escape from the Dreen, the Hexosehr discovered a planet with ancient ruins, containing an inactive 'black box.' Sent out to make sure the Dreen don't get it and any other advanced technology, the Vorpal Blade II goes on this mission in a new ship with a new CO. The veterans of the Blade must teach the nuggets all the common sense they need to survive, as well as the Cheerick fighters they're training. On their arrival they discover a great secret in some "odd" encounters.

WWCB

WWCB (1370 AM) is an oldies/classic hits radio station licensed to Corry, Pennsylvania and serving Corry, Union City, eastern Erie County, Pennsylvania and Clymer, New York from its studio located at 122 North Center Street (PA 426) in downtown Corry and a transmitter facility off of West Columbus Avenue (U.S. Route 6). It is a Licensed Class B AM station operating 24 hours a day/7 days a week with 1,000 watts during the daytime, and 500 watts in the evening hours.
The station's format is oldies and classic hits, and also broadcasts a variety of local sports programming featuring Corry High School Beavers football, basketball, baseball and softball and Clymer High School football. In addition, WWCB serves as an affiliate for the Motor Racing Network's NASCAR coverage. The station is owned by Corry Communications Corporation.
History.
WWCB signed on in April 2, 1955 as WOTR. It moved to its current location on North Center Street over 30 years ago and become WWCB, standing for the local high school mascot, the "Corry Beavers".
As WWCB in the 70s, 80s and early 90s, the station featured long time personalities Bruce Lewis, Ron Smith and Barry Warnshius, with country music first thing in the morning and modern top 40 hits the rest of the day. The station was owned by Erie broadcasting icon Art Arkelien, who also owned FM station WYSS in Sagertown.
After the station was sold in the 90s, it became full service Power 1370 (Oldies), and was part of a two station network with WYNE in North East. WMCE is now owned by Mercyhurst College.
In September 2010, Vilkie Communications took over operations of the station changing it to match their "Cool" moniker, based on "Cool 101.7" WMVL in Meadville. The station featured oldies from the 60s, 70s and 80s and took on the call letters WHYP, also formerly licensed to North East (and was the original callsign for the current WMCE).
On December 1, 2011, Whiplash Radio LLC signed an LMA/purchase agreement on WHYP, keeping the Cool name, and instituting a more tightly-programmed classic hits format. The station featured syndicated morning personality Charlie Tuna in mornings, Barry Warnshius in middays and station operator Chris Lash in afternoons. Dick Bartley's "Classic Countdown" and "Rock and Roll's Greatest Hits" programs were heard on the weekends. 
On July 15, 2013, The Mid State Sports Network signed an LMA / Purchase Agreement on WHYP. In order to avoid any confusion with another area radio station, Cool 101.7 - WMVL in Meadville, management made the decision to drop WHYP and return to the WWCB call sign under the slogan: "Corry's Hometown Radio Station". That change became effective on August 30, 2013.
Personalities on the station include Sam Jordan (6am - 9am); Alan Kabel (9am - 12pm); Tom Kent (1pm - 6pm) and other unnamed air personalities. The station will still continue to air Dick Bartley's syndicated shows on the weekend.
The commitment to sports programming continues as well.
The station is the flagship station for the Erie Explosion indoor football team (2013 Continental Indoor Football League Champions). In addition, 1370 AM airs select NCAA Football and NFL Football games on the station. This accentuates the coverage that the station has with NASCAR Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series races, heard on the weekend.

Keeravani

Keeravani (pronounced ) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 21st "Melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. The 21st "melakarta" rāgam as per Muthuswami Dikshitar school of music is .
This rāgam is a popular scale in western music as well. The Western equivalent is the Harmonic minor scale. It is said to be borrowed into Hindustani music from Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 3rd rāgam in the 4th "chakra Veda". The mnemonic name is "Veda-Go". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ri gi ma pa dha nu". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music" for details on below notation and terms):
(the notes used in this scale are "chathusruthi rishabha, sadharana gandhara, suddha madhyama,panchama
suddha dhaivatha, kakali nishadha")
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Simhendramadhyamam", which is the 57th "melakarta".
Janya Rāgams.
"Keeravani" has many "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. "Kalyāna vasantam" is a popular "janya" of "Keeravani". See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with "Keeravani". Other popular "janya" ragams include "Sāmapriya" and "Vasantamanohari".
Compositions.
Many composers have composed songs in "Keeravani". A few of them are listed here.

This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Keeravani's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 3 other major "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Hemavati", "Vakulabharanam" and "Kosalam". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.

John Veitch (footballer)

John Gould Veitch (19 July 1869 – 3 October 1914) was an English amateur footballer, who played for the Corinthian club in the 1890s. He made one appearance for England playing at inside left in 1894, in which he scored a hat trick.
Family and education.
Veitch was born in Kingston Hill, Surrey, the son of John Gould Veitch and his wife, Jane (née Hodge). His father was a horticulturist, one of a long line of renowned plant collectors and breeders. His elder brother James Herbert Veitch became a partner and subsequently owner of the Veitch Nurseries business.
Veitch was educated at Westminster School and was a member of the school football side in 1887. He then went up to Cambridge University, where he won a blue in 1888, 1889, 1890 and 1891.
Football career.
On leaving university, he continued to play for Old Westminsters, although he was also a member of the Corinthian amateur club, having made his first appearance for them while still at university on 26 January 1889 in a 1–0 defeat by Preston North End. His next appearance was on 16 February when he scored in a 3–1 victory over Scottish Cup finalists, Celtic.
Over the next few years, his appearances for Corinthian were fairly infrequent, until after he had left university. In the 1891–92 season, he played in thirteen of Corinthian's 16 fixtures, scoring twelve goals, including a hat-trick against Scootish side Renton on 18 April 1892. In the following season he only played nine matches, but in 1893–94 he made 17 appearances scoring ten goals. In the match against Derby County on 27 March 1894, he scored four goals as Corinthian ran out 5–3 winners.
For the match against Wales at Wrexham on 12 March 1894, the England selectors decided to field a team consisting entirely of players with Corinthian connections, including three players making their international début. Lewis Vaughan Lodge (Cambridge University) made the first of five appearances at right back; Arthur Topham (Casuals) made his solitary England appearance at left half while the third débutante was John Veitch who played at inside left, alongside his fellow Old Westminster Rupert Sandilands.
Wales opened the scoring after 10 minutes, but by half-time England had taken the lead with a goal from Veitch and an own goal from Charlie Parry. Veitch scored again early in the second half and completed his hat-trick in the 80th minute, thus joining a select band to score a hat-trick on his début. The fifth goal came from Robert Cunliffe Gosling as England ran out comfortable 5–1 victors. Veitch is one of five players to have scored a hat-trick on his England debut, yet not make a second appearance.
Veitch started the 1894–95 season with seven goals in the opening three matches, but he was then only able to make the occasional appearance, with his final match for Corinthian coming on 13 April 1898, when he appeared at full-back. In his nine years with Corinthian, he scored 49 goals in 69 appearances.
After football.
He joined the family horticulture business as company secretary. He did not enjoy good health for long as he had weak lungs and suffered from premature deafness. Following the death of his brother, James in 1907, John succeeeded to the Chelsea, London business. He did not, however, have the ability to run the business successfully, and his uncle Sir Harry Veitch returned to take over control. Following John's death in October 1914 at the age of 45, Sir Harry closed the business.

Richard Thornton Wilson, Jr.

Richard Thornton Wilson, Jr. (September 11, 1866 - December 29, 1929)
was an American banker and businessman who was a prominent figure in Thoroughbred horse racing in the early decades of the 20th Century.
Wilson was born in New York City one of five surviving children of Richard Thornton Wilson, Sr. and Melissa Clementine Johnston. Richard, Sr. was a multimillionaire investment banker originally from Loudon, Tennessee who served on the staff of Lucius B. Northrop, the Commissary-General of the Confederate States of America.
Richard, Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and was successful in banking and business. He married Marion Steedman Mason on March 11, 1902, daughter of Amos Lawrence Mason and Louisa Blake Steedman. Richard Jr. and Marion had two daughters: Marion Mason Wilson and Louisa Steedman Wilson.
Richard, Jr. died on December 29, 1929. His funeral service was held at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York. He was interred in the family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.
Thoroughbred racing.
In 1896, Richard Wilson, Jr. hired Thomas J. Healey to manage his racing stable. Together for three decades, they would win a number of the most important East Coast races including the Travers Stakes three times, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. 
Richard Wilson Jr.'s sister Grace Graham Wilson married Cornelius "Neily" Vanderbilt III of the Vanderbilt family. Neily's sister Gertrude was married to prominent horseman Harry Payne Whitney. In 1896, Richard Wilson, Jr. and Harry teamed up with a group of investors to purchase Saratoga Race Course which had fallen into the hands of an undesirable New Jersey brothelkeeper, Gottfried Waldbaum. Wilson then served as president of the Saratoga Racing Association which operated the facility. Wilson's other siblings also married into very prominent families. His older brother, Marshall Orme Wilson, married Caroline Schermerhorn "Carrie" Astor, youngest daughter of William Backhouse Astor, Jr. and Caroline Webster Schermerhorn of the Astor family. Carrie's brother was Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, richest passenger on the "RMS Titanic". Wilson's other two sisters, Mary (May) and Belle, married, respectively, New York real estate heir, Ogden Goelet, and the Honorable Sir Michael Henry Herbert, brother of the Earl of Pembroke and British ambassador to the United States, during Theodore Roosevelt's administration. Wilson's niece, Mary Goelet, married the Duke of Roxburghe. Because of all the family's advantageous marriages, the Wilsons were known in New York and Newport society as the "Marrying Wilsons."
In 1902, Richard Wilson, Jr. purchased an estate at Palmetto Bluff in South Carolina from John Holbrook Estill where in 1910 he built a mansion and maintained a stable and a blacksmith shop. The home burned down in 1926 and the property was sold. [http://www.palmetto-bluff.com/history_wilson_era.asp]

Pillory (horse)

Pillory (foaled 1919 in Kentucky) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse.
Background.
Pillory was a chestnut horse bred and raced by the co-owner and president of Saratoga Race Course, Richard T. Wilson, Jr.. Pillory was sired by Wilson's Olambala, a multiple winner of important races including the Latonia Derby and Suburban Handicap, and who sired several top runners including the 1916 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt Campfire, and top handicap winner Sunfire. Pillory's damsire was Disguise, who raced for James R. Keene in England and was a son of Domino.
Pillory's race conditioning was handled by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer T. J. Healey.
Racing career.
At age three in 1922, Pillory ran second to J. S. Cosden's French import Snob II. Thoroughbred racing in 1922 was still a time when the U.S. Triple Crown series had not yet achieved the level of importance it would in the next decade. As such, despite being very important races, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes were both run on May 13, 1922. The handlers of New York-based Pillory chose not to send the colt on the long railroad trip to Louisville for the Derby. Instead, they entered the colt in the then 1 1/8 mile Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. In the Preakness, Pillory took the lead on the turn into the stretch and prevailed by a head from Hea after what the press described as a "furious" drive to the finish. Pillory's time of 1:51.60, equaled the winning time of Man o' War two years earlier. Pillory then won the mile and three furlongs Belmont Stakes, defeating rival Snob II, who finished second. In the ensuing Jockey Club Gold Cup, Pillory faced a field of older horses and finished third behind winner Mad Hatter.
Although Pillory won two very important races and was the leading money-winning horse in the United States in 1922, he was not rated American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Instead, the honor went to Harry Payne Whitney's colt Whiskaway.
Stud record.
Pillory was not successful at stud. He was eventually sold to the U.S. Army as a remount stallion.

Per Argentine

Per Philip Argentine, born 1986, is a low budget filmmaker responsible for the making of approximately a dozen short films.
Early career.
Argentine grew up in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He followed the footsteps of his father Peter, who is the founder of Argentine Productions, a small filmmaking corporation based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. One of Argentine's first feature films was "The Incredible Dave Moneit", a story about a young man and his plot to take over his school. The film was a statement on the groups and cliques in the typical American high school. The Mount Lebanon High School newspaper, "The Devil's Advocate", claimed it one of Mount Lebanon's greatest accomplishment of all time, and has since been aired in Japan.
Argentine began his college career in 2004 at The Pennsylvania State University. He made short films with his floor-mates being the actors. First year films included "Return" and "Balance". The film, "Lock the Door", has said to be lost in time and was never completed, although all of the scenes were shot. During his second year, Argentine devoted most of his time to his studies, but managed to produce two more films, including "Orangutan" and his first film festival movie, "Body and Spirit", which was shown in the 2006 Penn State Film Festival, receiving much applause. During his third and fourth year, Per took somewhat of a hiatus and disappeared from the movie making scene to focus on his studies. Argentine spent months writing the mini-series "Kevin Johnson and His Merry Players", but due to budget cuts and actors not willing, the movie had to be scrapped after only two weeks of production. Argentine rebounded, however, and directed the short film "Snowbound", "Killtacular", and his thesis short film "Sleep", which would end up being the feature film in the 2008 Penn State Film Festival. He also made some nonprofit music videos and was the Videographer Captain for the 2008 Penn State Dance Marathon, THON.
After graduating, Argentine collaborated on an award winning short, "Spotless: A Clean Break", for the 2009 Pittsburgh 48 Hour Film Project (Best fight Choreography and Best Directing). He was editor and cameraman for director Jacob Hoyson's "Spaceventures: Episode 26: Ice to Meet You" and "Angles Along the Vector".
Current projects.
Argentine is an editor and director of historical documentaries and National Parks Films at Argentine Productions and frequently collaborates with fellow Pittsburgh filmmakers Jacob Hoyson, Ryan Parent, and Dan Gray. Current projects include an unnamed short film about paintballers and another chapter in Jacob Hoyson's ongoing "Dexy" short films.
Though not well known outside of Pittsburgh, Argentine has achieved a following within the city.

Ratsat

Ratsat, or DemoSat, was a 165-kilogram (363-pound) non-functional boilerplate spacecraft used as a mass simulator on the fourth flight of the Falcon 1 rocket.
Ratsat was carried to orbit on the first successful orbital launch of any privately funded and developed, liquid-propelled carrier rocket, the SpaceX Falcon 1. The launch, identified as "Falcon 1 Flight 4", was conducted by SpaceX, and marked the first time the Falcon 1 rocket successfully achieved orbit, after three consecutive failures on the three previous launch attempts.
Ratsat remained bolted to the second stage of the carrier rocket after reaching low Earth orbit. It has a hexagonal prism shape, 1.5 m (5 ft) long.
SpaceX co-founder Elon Musk estimates that Ratsat will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere.
Preparations.
When the fourth flight was first announced in August 2008, shortly after the third flight failed, it was planned for launch in September. The rocket that was used to conduct the test flight was originally built to launch the RazakSAT satellite. The test flight was introduced into the launch schedule because Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd (ATSB) required a successful flight to be conducted before RazakSAT could be launched.
The schedule left very little time for modifications and testing. The rocket was shipped to the company's testing facilities in Texas where, after less than 24 hours, it was certified for launch. SpaceX chartered a United States Air Force C-17 flight on 3–4 September to carry both stages of the rocket 9,700 km (6,000 mi) to the launch facilities at the Kwajalein Atoll. The Falcon 1 rocket was successfully test-fired on 20 September. Launch preparations on 23 September led the ground crew to replace part of a pipeline supplying liquid oxygen to the second stage "Kestrel" engine. This work delayed the launch to 28 September.
Launch.
The launch occurred from Omelek Island, part of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Liftoff occurred at 23:15 UTC on 28 September, 15 minutes into a five-hour launch window. If the launch had been scrubbed, it could have been conducted during the same window until 1 October. Nine minutes and 31 seconds after launch, the second stage engine shut down, after the vehicle reached orbit. The initial orbit was reported to be about 330 x 650 km.
Following a coast period, the second stage restarted, and performed a successful second burn, resulting in a final orbit of 621 x 643 km x 9.35°.
It was Falcon 1's first successful launch, and the first successful orbital launch of any privately funded and developed, liquid-propelled carrier rocket.
The rocket followed the same trajectory as the previous flight, which failed to place the Trailblazer, NanoSail-D, PreSat and Explorers spacecraft into orbit. No major changes were made to the rocket, other than increasing the time between first stage burnout and second stage separation. This minor change addressed the failure seen on the previous flight, recontact between the first and second stages, by dissipating residual thrust in the first stage engine before separating them.
Although SpaceX intended to recover the first stage of Falcon 1 launch vehicles, as of this launch, they had not yet succeeded in doing so. Stage recovery was a non-primary goal of the early flights. SpaceX is utilizing an incremental development process to work the design issues with stage recovery and CEO Elon Musk stated that the probability of a successful recovery would have increased with subsequent flights, however the Falcon 1 was subsequently retired from service after its fifth launch, with first stage recovery never having been accomplished successfully.

KCFV

KCFV (89.5 FM) is a radio station licensed in Ferguson, Missouri, USA. The station is owned by St. Louis Community College.
History.
The station began operation on April 17, 1972 under license by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as a Class D low-power educational broadcasting service of Florissant Valley Community College (now St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley). The initial transmitted power was regulated to 10 watts omnidirectional, leading to the campus nickname, "the weakest station in the nation". KCFV billed itself as "The 10-Watt Wonder". The station used the slogan, "Just Slightly Ahead of Our Time", a reference to the non-Top 40 progressive music that it featured.
Since its beginning, KCFV has been operated by students of St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley. Most of the on-air staff are majoring in Mass Communications.
Early broadcasts included a progressive rock music format, public affairs programs, news and sports. The station signed on daily at 3:00 pm with "The Towne Square", a progressive rock-themed, magazine-style program that followed a weekly rotation of music news, comedy, items of local interest, and politics. The balance of the broadcast day was filled by disc jockey programs of rock music. The station signed off at midnight.
Following changes in FCC rules governing low-power FM stations (LPFMs) in the early 1980s, the station was granted a Class L1 license to raise its transmitter power to 100 watts. KCFV is currently known as "The Wave", and programming features a wide variety of music formats. The station's slogan is "Diverse Music For Your Diverse Mind".

Cedartown High School

Cedartown High School is the only high school in the city of Cedartown, Georgia, USA. It is run by the principal (Darrell Wetherington). The school is classified as a 4A school by the Georgia High School Association.
History.
The school was founded in 1887. In 1903 the school created a football team with the mascot "The Cedartown Bulldogs." By the 1930s the school was rebuilt in a new location in order to serve the growing teenage population of the town. Vocational or "elective" classes were added in the 1930s and a school band in 1941. In 1970 the school was rebuilt in another location in the town.
Cedartown High School enrolls around 1200 students per year. Cedartown High School still goes by the bulldog, which they interpret to symbolize strength and endurance. The school colors are still red and black.
"Toland's Bulldog Pride," Cedartown High School's mascot, died Monday, Jan. 2, 2012, following a brief illness.
Pride was bought as a puppy from Mars Hill Bulldogs by the CHS Student Council and attended school each day. His affectionate and retiring personality made him a favorite member of the high school population as well as the community at large.
A brief memorial service was held Wednesday, Jan. 4, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Mike Hogg where Pride lived.
Those attending were Hal David, Robyn Teems, Barry Williams, Clint Jones, Scott Hendrix and son, Landon, Cindy Brooks, Alyson Reaves. Elisabeth and Chloe Powell. Kriss York, Dana Johnson, Jeff Ford. Scott McAnich, and Allie Hogg. Todd Tillery and CHS Skills USA also participated in the memorial.
In 2012 The History Press released a book that was written by William Austin that contained a chronological history of the Cedartown football team. The popular publication also included highlights of the cross-town African American High School Cedar Hill Panthers, which won four state championships in ten years of competition.
School song.
<poem>Written by Irene Redding
"In the hearts of Cedartown Students
Love shall never lack,
Nor our loyal admiration,
For the red and black.
May the black of our dear colors,
Stand for serious aims, 
While the crimson mingled with it,
Courage strong proclaims
To your lofty pure ideals,
We shall always cling,
And our heart's sincere devotion,
We shall always bring
Hail to thee our Alma Mater,
Let us pledge anew,
Faithful, loyal, willing service,
Cedartown, to you"
</poem>
Achievements.
In past ten years The Bulldogs have gone to Regional Championships for football three times and to State Championship once. The band won Grand Champion at the Osborne Marching Competition in 2004. Cedartown has an FBLA team, DECA team, and Academic Bowls Team. In 2008 and 2012, a student in the Welding Skills club won in a state competition and went to Nationals.

Stamford East railway station

Stamford East railway station was the Stamford & Essendine Railway station in Water Street, Stamford, Lincolnshire. The line was worked by the Great Northern Railway but retained its independence until 1886, when the GNR took the line on perpetual lease.
Opening.
The station was opened in 1856 as the terminus of the line to Essendine on the Great Northern Railway main line. The line was mainly intended for passengers travelling north, however through bookings were possible to Peterborough in direct competition with the Midland Railway.
In 1867, the S&ER opened a line to Wansford on the London and North Western Railway Nene Valley line from Northampton to Peterborough. The Wansford line ran east immediately adjacent to, on the north side, of the Midland line for over 2 miles, before gaining height and crossing over the Midland and curving south just before Uffington & Barnack station. This section is now part of the Torpel Way public footpath.
The Essendine line was built single track with provision for double tracking, and at one time it was double tracked, but the signalling arrangements did not meet with Board of Trade approval. Rather than make the necessary alterations, it was single tracked again except for the section between Stamford East and the Martin's Cultivators works. This section was left as two tracks but was operated as two single track lines, with one a running line and the other an industrial siding. This siding, known as Priory Siding, also served Priory Lime Works and the Blackstones works.
Services.
In 1863, the service consisted of eleven trains each way between Stamford and Essendine on weekdays, and two on Sundays.
In 1910 the service was fifteen each way on the Essendine branch, seven to Wansford, and eight return, with one extra on Fridays, but no Sunday services, and by 1922, this was reduced to ten each way on weekdays on the Essendine line and four on the Wansford line.
Through freight.
The Midland Railway was granted running powers over the Stamford and Essendine in 1866 and used it to sent goods traffic to the Eastern & Midland Railway at Bourne and thence to East Anglia, but the junction arrangements at Essendine, where a reversal and flat crossing of the GNR main line were required, meant that as traffic increased, the route via Peterborough and the Great Eastern became preferred. To regain traffic, the Eastern & Midland obtained powers in 1888 for a direct line from Bourne to the Midland Railway station at Saxby, near Melton Mowbray, and when this opened, most of the remaining east-west goods traffic was rerouted via the new line.
Closure.
The Wansford service never regained the traffic lost during the general strike, and closed to passengers in 1929. Ordnance Survey maps of 1946 show the line as "in situ", but disused, from Stamford to half a mile north of Wansford Road station. The Essendine service survived until 1959, but East station closed to passengers two years earlier in 1957 when services were diverted to the Midland Railway station.
East station continued in use for a few years as a goods station, and Priory Siding survived into the 1970s although truncated to the Blackstones works.
Sample train timetable for July 1922.
The table below shows the train departures from Stamford East on weekdays in July 1922.

Painted Skin (short story)

"Painted Skin" () is a famous short story from Pu Songling's "Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio". It tells of a scholar who is attracted to a beautiful maiden and brings her home, only to discover she is an ugly female ghoul who puts on a facial mask to look attractive, after "painting" it daily.
Story.
Once in Taiyuan there was a scholar called Wang (王). In an early morning he met a girl on the road who had been sold to a rich family by her parents. She could not stand the abuse of the wife of the rich and fled. The scholar agreed to give her refuge, let her stayed in his studio in secret, and slept with her. Suspecting that the girl could have been a concubine in the rich family, Wang's wife asked him to send the girl away without success.
One day, Wang encountered a Taoist priest in the market. The priest stared at Wang in surprise and asked him whether something strange had happened to him recently, because Wang looked enchanted by a ghost. Wang denied and left without taking the priest seriously. The priest lamented that Wang was going to die without noticing the precursors.
When Wang returned home, he found that the door of the studio was firmly closed. Having been stirred by the words of the priest, he sneaked to the window and peeked in. In the studio was a ghost with a green face and teeth like those of a saw spreading a piece of human hide on the bed and painting it. Then, the ghost lifted up the hide, shook it like a piece of cloth, cloaked itself in the hide, and transformed into the girl.
Being greatly shocked, Wang rushed to the priest and knelt before him, seeking help. The priest told Wang that the ghost was also having a hard life finding a victim, and he would not want to hurt it. The priest gave Wang a chowry and made him hang it on the door where he slept. After returning home, Wang dared not sleep in the studio, so he slept in another room and hanged the chowry there.
Every night, Wang heard sounds outside the door. Too fearful to investigate, he had his wife check in his place. At first, in fear of the chowry, the girl stood outside the door for a long time before she left. Shortly afterwards, scolding the priest, the girl returned. She took off the chowry, destroyed it, broke into the room, went to the bed directly, opened Wang's chest, and went away holding his heart. Wang's wife yelled. A maid came with candle light. Wang was found dead with messy body. His wife was too scared to cry with sound.
The next day, the wife of Wang made his younger brother Erlang (二郎) tell the priest. The priest was angry and went with Erlang to Wang's house, but could not find the girl. The priest looked around and found that the ghost was in the house near the south yard, which turned out to be the house of Erlang. The priest told Erlang that the old woman, who came to Erlang's house in the morning saying that she wanted to work as a servant, was the ghost.
Erlang returned home together with the priest. Seeing the priest, the old woman was very scared and fled through the door. The priest chased and attacked her. The old woman fell down. The human hide slipped away, and the old woman turned into the ghost, lying on the ground and crying like a pig. The priest beheaded the ghost with a wooden sword. The body of the ghost dissipated into smoke on the ground. The priest took a gourd out and pulled out the plug, and the smoke was sucked into the gourd. Then, the priest plugged the gourd and put it in a sack...

Xg antigen system

The XG antigen is a red blood cell surface antigen discovered in 1962.
The PBDX gene that encodes the antigen is located on the short arm of the X chromosome. Since males normally have one X chromosome they are considered hemizygotes. Since women have two copies of the gene and could be heterozygotic for the presence or absence of the functioning gene they could (through the process of lyonisation) express the functioning protein on just some of their red blood cells.

Mobile reporting

Mobile Reporting is a trend emerging in the field of news and content generation. The term describes the use of a mobile phone as a reporting tool. The user creates text, photo and video that combined produces a multimedia based report. The content is edited on the phone before being uploaded to the internet via mobile network or Internet connection. Usually mobile reporting is used for publishing to the web. This is particularly the case with video as the technology does not yet allow for the production of high end video. However, the low quality is suitable for Internet.
Mobile reporting is particularly relevant in areas that lack modern Internet infrastructure (Sub Sahara Africa, Central Asia, South America, Latin America). The mobile phone is low in cost when compared to more traditional reporting equipment.
Commercial uses.
Specifically, Mobile Field Reporting may also refer to enabling employees and staff, and first responders (police, fire, EMS) to access their networks and resources in a secure and timely manner using various public or proprietary mobile devices and applications.
Technology.
Mobile Reporting makes use of a content repurposing platform. This is a platform that supports services that let content owners and users create, share and publish multimedia content whenever and wherever, regardless of format or device. A mobile reporting platform takes care of the compatibility between the originating and target device.

Campfire (horse)

Campfire (1914–1932) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse.
Background.
Bred and raced by the co-owner and president of Saratoga Race Course, Richard T. Wilson, Jr., he was sired by Wilson's Olambala, a multiple winner of important races including the Latonia Derby and Suburban Handicap and who would also sire several top runners including the multiple Handicap winner Sunfire and the 1922 Belmont and Preakness Stakes winner Pillory. Campfire was conditioned for racing by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer T. J. Healey.
Racing career.
Racing at age two in 1916, Campfire joined the great filly Regret as only the second horse to win all three Saratoga Race Course events for two-year-olds: the Saratoga Special Stakes, Sanford Stakes and the Hopeful Stakes, in which he defeated Omar Khayyam. Winning all three races would not be matched for another seventy-seven years, when Dehere did it in 1993 followed by City Zip in 2000. In addition, Campfire won the Futurity and Great American Stakes at Belmont Park. Campfire was leading money winner among all American horses in 1916 irrespective of age. Campfire's outstanding year led to his being retrospectively named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt by The Blood-Horse magazine.
Racing at age three, much was expected of Campfire. He won the Toboggan Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York but did not win another race that year or at age four in 1918.
Stud record.
Retired to stud for the 1919 season, Campfire met with limited success as a sire. Most notable was his son Wilderness, who won the 1923 Toronto Cup Handicap and the Travers Stakes and Vander Pool who won a record-tying fifteen consecutive races.
Campfire died at a Maryland farm in 1932.

<doc id="19508362" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19508362" title="Morton Pumpkin Festival">
Morton Pumpkin Festival

The Morton Pumpkin Festival was first held in Morton, Illinois in 1967; however, similar festivals had been held prior to this since the early 1900s. These early festivals weren’t always annual events and changed from year to year, depending on the theme and organization that ran it. Some years, there was no town festival. In 1967 the Morton Chamber of Commerce stepped in and established what is now the Morton Pumpkin Festival. It is now held annually from Wednesday through Saturday in mid-September. In 1978, Governor James R. Thompson declared Morton the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.”
Economic impact.
The Morton Chamber of Commerce is the main organization that gets all of the festival activities scheduled. According to Jamie Sanders, events coordinator for the Chamber of Commerce, they count on more than 900 volunteers alone to help with the main food tent. It takes 50 people just to run a shift. All the money earned from festival stays within the community.
35 different businesses help out with volunteers to make the festival go smoothly.
Morton Rotary club sells all the tickets to all of the activities and the business owners do all of the breakfasts and dinners.
Morton Masonic Lodge sells food in order to be able to have money to grant scholarships to Morton High School seniors.
The festival also impacts the economy of Peoria as well by providing an opportunity for tourist and motor coach tours.
The businesses also partake in a window painting competition. All of the businesses downtown paint their storefront windows to the theme of the festival. The festival brings in people from all over the state to enjoy the festivities. Attendance was down in 2008 about 50 to 60% from last year due to the rain forecast for the weekend.
Food.
Many attendees of the festival come just for the food, especially the pumpkin flavored food. Beyond the usual fair/carnival favorites and pumpkin pie, some of the other items include pumpkin chili, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin doughnuts, pumpkin caramel shake, pumpkin ice cream and pumpkin fudge.
The marquee food-related event typically happens on the Saturday morning of the Pumpkin Festival. Saturday morning showcases the all-you-can-eat Pumpkin Pancake breakfast. One price includes all the pumpkin pancakes you can eat, sausage, coffee & milk. All served under a huge tent with local children providing breakfast-time entertainment.
Punkin Chuckin'.
The Punkin Chuckin' Contest is a tradition that involves giant contraptions that hurl, catapult, or shoot 5-10 pound pumpkins in the air into an open field. Competitors compete for the title of “Punkin' Chucker Supreme” with a one mile goal. The contest is now well over a decade old and is said to be modeled after the contest in Sussex County, Delaware the first weekend after Halloween, but Morton holds the world record for farthest pumpkin thrown.
The contest takes place in an open field over a span of two days. Around 500 pumpkins are picked in advance specifically for the contest which sports both a youth and an adult competition. The youth competition uses pumpkins from 5 to 8 pounds and the adult competition uses pumpkins from 8 to 10 pounds. Before the main throwing begins there is a safety meeting, during which there is also a “hand throwing contest” with a one dollar entry fee. The contest moves from the youth section into the adult, giving each team one throw, then moves back to the beginning and starts again giving each team a total of three contest throws. In between throws there are short breaks in which teams throw for fun and try to aim at old cars placed in the fields for targets. The contest is all about distance and at the end of the second day a winner is declared.
The Punkin Chuckin’ Contest has turned out some pretty amazing machines, from trebuchets to air cannons, but one machine holds a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. The Q-36 Pumpkin Modulator is a long air cannon that fired a pumpkin for a world record (the record as of November 2010 is held by team Big 10 Inch at 5545.43 ft). The Q-36 has an barrel and a air tank and tips the scale at . A pumpkin leaving the tube flies at nearly but loses velocity quickly. This cannon has been seen on the Late Show with David Letterman as well as another famous device, the Acme Catapult, which saw airtime on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2003.
Performances.
Performances in 2008 included: Morton High School (Morton, Illinois) Chorale Group, Central Illinois Banjo Club, New Odyssey, Central Illinois Performing Arts Performers, Jim Markum Swing Band, Singsations, American English, and Bloomsday.
Pumpkin King Court.
In 1984, soon after the introduction of performances, the Morton Chamber of Commerce added a "Pumpkin King Court" competition. The event quickly gained popularity, and in recent years, is said to have been the source of nearly 60% of revenues. The format of the competition allows a group of randomly selected males to showcase their talents on stage for the coveted title of Pumpkin King. The winner, who is voted on by a panel small business owners, receives a crown adorned by pumpkin seeds, and free pumpkin ice cream for the remainder of the festival. In 2012, Tremont's Erich Drafahl was crowned Pumpkin King for his act, which he called "looking really good." The performance garnered millions of YouTube views and eventually national press.

Jenny (gorilla)

Jenny (c. 1953 - September 4, 2008) was a Western lowland gorilla who resided at the Dallas Zoo in Dallas, Texas. Jenny was the world's oldest gorilla in captivity at the time of her death in 2008 at the age of 55. Jenny was confirmed to be the oldest living gorilla in the world by the International Species Information System earlier in 2008. 
Jenny was born in the wild, so her exact date of birth is unknown. She was acquired by the Dallas Zoo in 1957, where she lived for the rest of her life. Jenny gave birth to a daughter, Vicki, in 1965, but failed to conceive again. As a result, Jenny became part of an American study on the effects of menopause on gorillas. Jenny's daughter, Vicki, was transferred to a zoo in Alberta, Canada when she was five years old. 
The Dallas Zoo celebrated Jenny's 55th birthday in May 2008 with a celebration and frozen fruit birthday cake.
She remained in relatively good health throughout her life, weighing 218 pounds (99 kilograms). However, Jenny was diagnosed with an inoperable stomach tumor during the last few weeks of her life. She had stopped eating and drinking. Jenny was euthanized as a "quality-of-life decision" at the Dallas Zoo on September 4, 2008, at the age of 55.
Colo, a 55-year-old gorilla who is kept at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and is the first gorilla ever born in captivity, succeeded Jenny as the world's oldest known gorilla. A gorilla's normal life expectancy in the wild is usually 30 to 35 years.

Mulga Bill's Bicycle

"Mulga Bill's Bicycle" is a poem written in 1896 by Banjo Paterson. 
The poem is a ballad. Each line is a fourteener, having fourteen syllables and seven iambic feet. 
It tells the tragic tale of Mulga Bill, a man whose pride in his riding skill causes him to purchase, ride and crash a bicycle. Although Mulga Bill claims expertise in riding all things his ineptitude and subsequent accident suggest that he may only know how to ride a horse.
The poem was first published in "The Sydney Mail" on 25 July 1896. It is amongst Paterson's most popular works. A 1973 reprinting of the poem illustrated by Kilmeny & Deborah Niland has been continuously in print since publication and won the 1973 ABPA Book Design Award and the 1974 Visual Arts Board Award.
The novel by H. G. Wells on cycling, "The Wheels of Chance: A Bicycling Idyll" was published in the same year as this poem.
The poem actually featured the Safety bicycle. However, the poem has been inaccurately illustrated by various illustrators with a depiction of the visually more interesting Penny-farthing which had been superseded at the time the poem was written. The introduction of safety cycles gave rise to a bicycling boom with millions being manufactured in the decade 1890-1900. They were very popular in the Australian outback, widely used by shearers and itinerant workers at the time that Paterson wrote this poem.
The model for the character of Mulga Bill was William Henry Lewis (1880-1968), who knew Paterson in the vicinity of Bourke, New South Wales. Lewis had bought his bicycle as a result of a drought when there was no feed for horses. 
Eaglehawk, Victoria—once a rural mining town, now part of greater Bendigo—was given as Mulga Bill's hometown ("Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk ..."). This has been recognised with the development of the Mulga Bill Bicycle Trail, a scenic ride taking in many of the mining attractions, historic sites and modern-day amenities of Eaglehawk.
Mulga is a very common species of Acacia that predominates the interior regions of the Australian bush, and colloquially, it is an alternative term for the Bush itself or wilderness regions, for example ‘up the mulga’.
The poem has been set to music and the poem title was the name of a prominent Australian folk music group (also known as a bush band) in the 1970s.

Bednash v Hearsey

Bednash v. Hearsey (also known as "Re DGA (UK) Ltd") is a UK company law case, that came to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.
Facts.
Mr Lane Bednash was the liquidator of the DGA (UK) Ltd. DGA had provided engineering consulting services. Bednash sought an order under the Insolvency Act 1986 s.212 (misfeasance for breach of a fiduciary duty) and s.238 (transactions at an undervalue) against Mr Hearsey. Mr Hearsey had been the sole beneficial shareholder and controlling director of DGA. DGA had traded successfully in 1991 and 1992, but then its position had worsened. It had gone into liquidation through voluntary winding up proceedings in 24 February 1994. Apparently, in April 1994, there had been a burglary at the office by an unknown person, and all the accounts books had been stolen.
Bednash contended that Hearsey had paid himself an excessive salary and pension contributions.
High Court.
Nicholas Stewart QC, for the High Court Chancery Division gave judgment on 15 February 2001. He allowed Bednash's claim in part. 
In 1991 and 1992, because the company had been successful, and Mr Hearsey had adequately carried out his duties, it could not be said that pay or pension contributions were excessive. That was because there was no significant risk to DGA's creditors.
However, Hearsey's remuneration in following years was objectionable. There was a lack of clear evidence about Hearsey's actions. Despite that, if Hearsey had no reliable view on DGA's financial position, it was not responsible to pay himself large sums of money. Alternatively, if Hearsey had had a reliable view of DGA's finances, paying himself large sums of money would have also been irresponsible, because there had been a substantial risk to DGA's creditors.
Court of Appeal.
Sir Martin Nourse (with whom Potter LJ concurred) upheld the decision of the High Court, after Mr Hearsey appealed.

List of Bottom characters

Below is description of the characters in the 1990s BBC British sitcom Bottom.
Richie & Eddie.
Richard "Richie" Richard is a perpetually optimistic dimwit, while Edward "Eddie" Hitler is a cheerfully violent dipsomaniac.
Their arguments often lead to exaggerated, destructive fight scenes. Some have likened this to a live action cartoon. However, the boisterousness is somewhat more graphic: examples include heads slammed in and under refrigerators; hands stapled to tables; legs being chainsawed off; genitalia slammed in doors or set on fire; fingers cut off; televisions smashed over heads; darts, forks, or fingers ending up in eyes; faces shoved in camp fires; legs broken or teeth knocked out. Some of the visual effects used for these events are very realistic, whereas others are deliberately fake. All are accompanied by a variety of over-the-top sound effects. The BBFC has given the Bottom: The Complete Series DVD a classification of 15, with a violence rating of "None".
Richie is known to be a virgin (Eddie stole Richie's only ever "girlfriend", Ethel Cardew, and sometimes torments Richie with how he had sex with her), with a microscopic penis (which he sometimes mistakes for his only pube). However in the episode 'Digger' he almost has sex with an allegedly wealthy foreign countess, Lady Natasha Letitia Sarah Jane Wellesley Obstromsky Ponsonsky Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Oblomov Boblomov Dob, after he and Eddie join a dating agency. Natasha agrees to marry Richie, much to his delight and he is totally oblivious to the fact that she is marrying him because she thinks he is a millionaire and she has lost her entire fortune. Towards the end of the episode, as Richie moves in to have sex with Lady Natasha he has an apparent heart attack, and is rushed to hospital. Whilst waiting for the ambulance, Eddie claims to have had sex with Lady Natasha, as he did Ethel (although in the episode 'Terror' in season three, Eddie looks distinctly nervous when he claims that the Devil drinks virgin's blood).
Richard also tends to believe that any woman who does not fancy him must be a lesbian. He is also unsure of the decade, claiming in the same episode (Carnival), that it is both the 80s and then 70s later on- with a bemused Eddie looking to the camera after Richie mentions it's the 80s after all. Richie usually wears a white shirt (tucked into his Y-fronts) and slim black tie (with tie clip), blue jeans (with a belt that clearly misses most of the loops) and has a light brown raincoat when outdoors. He also occasionally wears brown trousers, held up with braces, and a red tie. His character is aspirational, pretentious, and occasionally a snob.
Eddie is a cheerfully violent alcoholic (he claims that this is because he "drinks a lot"). He wears glasses akin to those of Eric Morecambe, a brown suit and a white shirt with a black spotted tie (Which he tucks inside his trousers) on closer inspection one can see that Eddie's suit jacket and trousers have several stains and frays. Despite having a shaven head, he sports sideburns. He also has a brown trilby hat and a tweed coat. He seems to have quite a wide circle of friends, making it a mystery why he spends so much of his time with Richie. His friends include two sad-cases named Spudgun (Steve O'Donnell) and Dave Hedgehog (Christopher Ryan) who mostly hang out together, though Dave is also a family man. (His wife Susan is never seen but his daughter Doreen appeared once in the episode "Terror".) Richie does not appear to have any friends at all other than Eddie: he sometimes appropriates Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog if in need of company, though he actually despises both of them (particularly Spudgun) and considers all Eddie's other friends to be beneath him. Eddie is also revealed to be a Queen's Park Rangers fan, as in "Holy", he sprayed the letters "QPR" on the wall with spray snow, and in "Dough", you can see QPR banners on his bedroom wall. He has been shown to break the fourth wall a few times in the series. It is also mentioned that men in Eddie's family have girls' names - his middle name is Elizabeth, and he once referred to a 'Great Uncle Susan'.
Richie and Eddie bear perhaps closer inspection than any of Mayall and Edmondson's other characters. Despite sharing a deep mutual hatred, the two are eternally entwined due to their basic flaws and they seem to have an unspoken respect for each other as a result. Eddie's alcoholism and violent nature mean that he has not been able to hold down a steady job since his very short-lived career as a "bunny girl", back in 1978 that lasted ten minutes, and it is unlikely that any landlord would grant him tenancy, even if he could afford the rent. He is therefore forced to rely upon Richie's charity. Richie, on the other hand, is such a pompous, self-obsessed, perverted, withering soul that without Eddie it is unlikely that he would ever make another friend, even if he wanted to (which he doesn't). The two have an unspoken acceptance of their interdependence and their relationship tends to fluctuate between acting like a married couple (filling in the crossword together, Richie putting an unconscious Eddie to bed every night), a mother and son (Richie often keeping Eddie 'in check' and scolding him, and often putting an end to his fun, often out of sheer spite even though Richie would like to indulge himself) and frustrated desperation. Both have died in numerous episodes, only to resurface unharmed the following episode. This partnership has similarities to those of Steptoe and Son, and Hancock and Sid in Hancock's Half Hour.
Richie is in heavy denial and has delusions of grandeur. He once tried to convince a Falklands ex-serviceman that he had fought ten years there, seizing the fictitious "Stroud Hill" and liberated the Stanley branch of Tesco). Eddie, by comparison, is grounded and seems to have quite good general knowledge, which he keeps to himself. He can play chess (and spends seven hours trying, unsuccessfully, to teach Richie), he knows a fair amount about Napoleon and Wellington (who Richie claims invented the Chelsea Boot) and appears well versed in the works of Vivaldi, (whom Richie believes to be a football player). Eddie is also a great one for plans - though most involve trying to get a free pint from Dick Head, the landlord at the Lamb and Flag. One such scheme, in the episode "Dough", involved Eddie printing counterfeit money, which he plasters with pornographic doodles of the Royal Family and other such celebrities (on the £5 the Queen "gets her jugs out", on the £10 note there is an orgy involving Meryl Streep, the Duke of Edinburgh and Bobby Charlton, and on the £27 note there is a picture of Sylvester Stallone "fisting" Mr MacHenry from The Magic Roundabout.
Richie and Eddie's relatives are often mentioned: Richie's grandad was at the Battle of the Somme, while Eddie's uncle used to work in a prison, (really a prisoner) peeling potatoes, sewing mailbags and doing ""...anything they told him to do"". Richie's auntie is very rich and dies in one episode with her nephew inheriting a large sum of money whilst his other aunt used to own the flat. Richie's father, Oswald Richard, was an acquaintance of Adolf Hitler and betrayed Britain in World War II. According to Richie, his dad moved in mysterious circles, because he had one leg shorter than the other. Richie's sister lives near Hammersmith and apparently looks just like her brother, albeit "with smaller jugs". Eddie's mother was a wrestler named "Adolf Hitler". who abandoned him when he was young leaving him her old service revolver and a note saying "Please look after my baby, I can't be bothered".

<doc id="19508616" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19508616" title="Bullfrog Power">
Bullfrog Power

Bullfrog Power is a Canadian green energy retailer operating in Canada. Bullfrog offers its customers power from renewable energy sources, such as wind, low-impact hydro and green natural gas, a renewable biogas product that serves as an alternative to fossil fuel-based natural gas. Bullfrog only sources electricity from generation sources that meet or exceed the federal government's Environmental Choice Program EcoLogo standard for renewable electricity. Bullfrog's green natural gas product is produced at facilities that have met environmental standards as defined by ICF International.
Across Canada, Bullfrog's electricity comes exclusively from regionally sourced wind and hydro facilities.
Bullfrog's green natural gas is produced at the Dépôt Rive-Nord, a biogas facility in Quebec.
Operation.
Bullfrog Power does not inject the green electricity or green natural gas directly into a customer’s home or facility, as doing so would require building parallel energy distribution systems, which are observed to be neither environmentally nor financially sound.
Instead, Bullfrog ensures that the electricity being put into the grid on its customers’ behalf is from renewable sources. For every MWh of clean, renewable electricity that is produced and injected onto the grid by a green power generator, a corresponding Green Electricity Certificate (GEC) is created to represent the positive environmental benefits (such as emissions reductions) associated with producing that green power.
Bullfrog uses a customer’s premium to secure and retire Green Electricity Certificates from wind or low-impact hydro generators on the customer’s behalf. This entitles the customer to claim the GECs—or green energy and associated emissions reductions—on his or her behalf. 
The price premium for a residential customer to purchase green electricity from Bullfrog is about $1 extra a day.
Similar to the way its green electricity offering works, Bullfrog secures and retires Green Natural Gas Certificates on behalf of customers, enabling customers to claim the green energy and associated environmental benefits on their behalf. 
Bullfrog Power's sister company, Less Emissions Inc., provides CDM Gold Standard, EcoLogo and VER+ Standard-certified carbon offsets.
Customers and Supporters.
Bullfrog Power currently has more than 8,000 residential customers and more than 1,300 commercial customers. Well-known residential customers include Measha Brueggergosman, Rachel McAdams, Andrew Ference, Kristina Groves, Thomas Homer-Dixon, and Nino Ricci. Notable bullfrogpowered organizations include Unilever Canada, AutoShare, Walmart Canada, Kraft Foods Canada, Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, and Dad's Cookies.
A number of environmental organizations support Bullfrog Power’s renewable energy, such as WWF-Canada, the David Suzuki Foundation and the Pembina Institute.
Transparency.
Bullfrog Power is audited on an annual basis to confirm that as much green electricity has been injected onto the grid as its customers have used, and that it has retired all emissions credits related to customer contracts. 
Bullfrog pioneered the concept of an annual audit for green electricity retailers when it launched in 2005. Bullfrog will undertake to deliver an annual green natural gas audit for its green natural gas offering, launched in 2011.
B Corporation Status.
In 2011, Bullfrog Power announced its certification as one of Canada’s founding B Corporations by B Lab. Certified B Corporations meet higher standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability. Unlike traditional corporations, Certified B Corporations are legally required to consider the impact of their decisions on their employees, suppliers, community, consumers, and the environment.
In 2012, Bullfrog Power was named to B Corporation's "Best for the World" list under the category "Best for the Environment."
In 2013, Bullfrog Power was once again named to B Corporation's "Best for the World" list, this time under the category "Best for Environmental Impact."
Pembina Institute.
The Pembina Institute is partnering with Bullfrog Power to help promote green power for homes and businesses across Canada. 
Bullfrog also markets itself with the assistance of endorsement quotations from CEOs of The David Suzuki Foundation and WWF Canada (World Wide Fund for Nature. Formerly World Wildlife Fund). See external links below.

David Cook (singer)

David Roland Cook (born December 20, 1982) is an American rock singer-songwriter, who rose to fame after winning the seventh season of the reality television show "American Idol". Prior to "Idol" he released an independent album entitled "Analog Heart", followed by his post-"Idol" major-label debut "David Cook" which was released on November 18, 2008 and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA. His second major album "This Loud Morning" was released on June 28, 2011.
Early life.
Cook was born in Houston, Texas, raised in Blue Springs, Missouri, and currently owns homes in Kansas City, Missouri and Nashville, Tennessee. His parents are Beth Foraker (née Frye) and Stanley Cook. He is the middle of three brothers – the late Adam Cook being older and Andrew younger. He is of German, Irish, and English descent.
Cook's interest in music began at a young age. He began singing in second grade, when his elementary school music teacher, Mrs. Gentry, gave him a part in a school Christmas performance. He proceeded to perform in virtually every Christmas and PTA program. He received his first guitar, a Fender Stratocaster, at the age of 13. He also participated in choir and drama programs in middle school and high school. At Blue Springs South High School, he performed in musicals, including "The Music Man", "West Side Story", and "Singin' in the Rain". In addition to this, he was an active member in the Blue Springs South High School National Forensics League (or NFL), where he qualified for the national tournament twice for duo interpretation, an event that relies on performance and interpretation of a literary work.
He was also an avid baseball player (pitcher) during high school and once gave up a home run to Albert Pujols in an American Legion Baseball game. After an injury, he focused more on music. He earned a theater scholarship to the University of Central Missouri, but he abandoned theater after two semesters, graduating from the school in 2006 with a degree in graphic design. While in college, he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa. After his college graduation, he relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma to pursue a career in music, telling his mother, "I just want to give myself until I'm 26 years old to get a job."
Early music career.
David Cook formed a band with his friend Bobby Kerr while at high school. The band was initially named Red Eye, later changed to Axium. He wrote his first song, titled "Red Hot", when he was fifteen. He was encouraged by Evan Sula-Goff of 8stops7 to make an album when he went to Cook's school to judge a contest, Mr. Jaguar, where David Cook and his band performed Guns N' Roses' "Paradise City". The band had some success when one of their songs, "Hold", was selected to be played in movie theaters across the country, and they were named one of the top 15 independent bands in the country by "Got Milk?" contest as well as the best Kansas City band in 2004. The band produced three studio albums – "Matter of Time", "Blindsided", and "The Story Thus Far", as well as a number of live albums including "Alive in Tulsa".
Axium however broke up in 2006 and David Cook moved to Tulsa where he joined Midwest Kings, a band he once opened for. He was the bassist for their EP "Incoherent With Desire to Move On". Members of that band Andy Skib and Neal Tiemann later became part of David Cook's post-"Idol" band The Anthemic. He recorded and self-released a solo album "Analog Heart" in 2006. He had also recorded his second solo album (unreleased) prior to appearing on "Idol", and was working as a bartender to support himself.
"American Idol".
Overview.
Cook originally did not plan to try out for the show. He went to the auditions in Omaha, Nebraska initially to support his younger brother (who did not make it to Hollywood) and then, prompted by mother and brother when a show producer noticed him, David auditioned himself. He performed Bon Jovi's "Livin' On a Prayer" for his audition. For his first Hollywood audition, Cook performed "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" by Bryan Adams, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. On the second song in Hollywood, he sang "I'll Be" by Edwin McCain. Cook took advantage of the decision to allow contestants to play musical instruments. Besides his Hollywood audition, he also accompanied himself on electric guitar for his performances of "All Right Now", "Hello", "Day Tripper", "I'm Alive", "Baba O'Riley", "Dare You to Move", and "Dream Big", and on acoustic guitar for "Little Sparrow", "", and "The World I Know". His white, left-handed Gibson Les Paul electric guitar has the letters "AC" on it; as Cook told "TV Guide", "I have two brothers, Adam and Andrew. So, because of superstition, I put their initials on everything growing up." Starting from the Top 12 week, he also wore (and continues to wear) an orange wristband to support a 7-year-old fan, Lindsey Rose, with leukemia.
Another of Cook's performances, The Beatles' "Day Tripper", was credited to Whitesnake. Seattle-based band Doxology has claimed that Cook's performance of The Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby" was based on a version the band recorded over a year ago. On April 1, before performing his self-arranged rendition of Dolly Parton's "Little Sparrow" on "American Idol", Cook told Ryan Seacrest in the interview session that his performance of "Eleanor Rigby" was based on Neil Zaza's and Doxology's versions. He also reiterated the credits of Whitesnake and Chris Cornell. Despite the controversy, critics praised Cook for choosing versions of songs that fit his vocal style. Cook's arrangements of "Happy Together", "Hello", "Little Sparrow", "Always Be My Baby", "All I Really Need Is You", "Baba O'Riley", "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", "Dream Big" and "The World I Know" were original arrangements.
Cook won the seventh season of "American Idol" on May 21, 2008, receiving 56 percent of the votes, with 12 million votes over David Archuleta, the runner-up. Cook then sang "The Time of My Life", the winning song of the 2008 "American Idol" Songwriter's Competition. In the final tally, Archuleta received 44 percent of the votes. During the final show, identical commercials promoting "Guitar Hero" featured Cook and fellow finalist Archuleta mimicked the Tom Cruise scene from "Risky Business" where he dances in his underwear playing an air guitar.
Post-"Idol" career.
A week following Cook's "American Idol" victory, in the "Billboard" chart week ending May 25, 2008, Cook broke several "Billboard" chart records. Most notable was his record shattering feat of having 11 songs debut on the Hot 100 that week, beating the previous record set by Miley Cyrus ("Hannah Montana") in 2006 when she had six songs debut on the chart. Cook's first single, "The Time of My Life" led the pack, debuting at number three on the Hot 100. Cook's eleven charting songs also gave him the most songs by one artist on the Hot 100 of any week in the Nielsen SoundScan era (which began in 1991), and the most of any era since The Beatles placed 14 songs on the chart the week of April 11, 1964. In addition, that same week Cook also broke the record for the most debuts on "Billboard"'s Hot Digital Songs chart, where he placed 14 debut entries, the record of which was previously six set by Bon Jovi in 2007. Cook's 17 entries had a combined total of 944,000 digital downloads in the first week of selling.
Cook also signed an endorsement deal with Skechers that ran through December 2009.
Cook's photo was also featured on the cover of The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2009, along with President Barack Obama and Senator John McCain.
2008–2009: "David Cook".
Cook worked with Espionage, Ed Roland (Collective Soul), Zac Maloy (The Nixons), Jason Wade (Lifehouse), Neal Tiemann (the Midwest Kings), Kevin Griffin (Better Than Ezra), Chantal Kreviazuk, and Raine Maida (Our Lady Peace) on his self-titled, major label debut album. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo. On Ryan Seacrest's morning show "On Air" of KIIS-FM on September 5, 2008, the singer revealed that the CD release date would be November 18, 2008.
The first single released from the album, "Light On" was announced on Cook's official site and debuted on September 23, 2008. By the week of October 10, 2008, the song had reached no. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single was certified platinum January 20, 2010. This is followed by a dual release of Come Back to Me and Bar-ba-sol, with "Come Back to Me" being released to HAC radio stations and Bar-ba-sol to rock radio. The music video for "Come Back to Me" was released on April 4, 2009.
His debut album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association for America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one-million units in January 2009. He was presented with his plaque while recording a performance that was aired during the April 1, 2009 episode of American Idol.
On January 23, 2009, Cook announced he would be embarking on his first headline national tour, the Declaration tour. Cook had earlier announced via his myspace blog that two former bandmates from Midwest Kings (MWK) would join his band, with Neal Tiemann as the lead guitar player, and Andy Skib on rhythm guitar and keyboard. Other members who joined later were Joey Clement (replaced later by Monty Anderson) on bass guitar, and Kyle Peek on drums and backing vocals. The tour began on February 13, 2009 in Tallahassee Florida, and was originally set to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 25, 2009. The tour however was extended twice – the first time through May 31, 2009, and then again starting from June 18, 2009 in Del Mar, CA and finally ending December 1, 2009 in Charlotte, NC after a total 153 shows. On August 14, 2009, David Cook performed his 100th show at the Tennessee Theatre in Knoxville, TN. On August 23, 2009 in an interview and at his concert in Yakima, WA Cook announced that the band would be known as The Anthemic.
2010–2011: "This Loud Morning".
David Cook began to concentrate working on this his second album after his first major tour, the Declaration Tour, concluded in December 2009. While on the tour, he put down some riffs and lyrical ideas, and started song-writing as a band towards the end of the tour. In an interview with Idolatry's Michael Slezak on February 8, 2010 Cook revealed that he is hard at work on his second album. He has been collaborating with Raine Maida and Chantal Kreviazuk, Matt Squire, Gregg Wattenberg, John Rzeznik, Sam Hollander & Dave Katz, Claude Kelly, Brian Howes, David Hodges, Tommy Henriksen, Steven Van Zandt, Kevin Griffin, Zac Maloy, Ryan Tedder, Jim Irvin, Jamie Jamie Houston, Ryan Star & Julian Emery and Max Martin. Besides that, he also collaborated with members of his band, The Anthemic – Neal Tiemann and Andy Skib. In an April interview with HitQuarters – recorded in March – the producer-songwriter Steve Mac said that Cook had recently visited his Rokstone Studios in London where together with Mac he had also been writing with Savan Kotecha and Andrew Frampton. He had hoped initially that a single would be ready for release in April 2010 and the album that summer. However, a producer for the album was not announced until May, and recording started in June that year with producer Matt Serletic at the helm. On March 31, 2011, Cook tweeted that the title of his new single will be The Last Goodbye and debuted on April 19, 2011. A press release was sent out on April 15, 2011 announcing the name of the album which will be called This Loud Morning and was released on June 28, 2011. He has also stated that at the beginning his goal was to make an album that "really, really pushed the concept of dynamic".
On September 13, 2011 it was announced that Cook would begin touring in support of "This Loud Morning" with a 2011 Fall Tour, co-headlining with Gavin DeGraw and with Carolina Liar in support, for 22 shows across 15 states beginning October 9, 2011 in State College, Pennsylvania and ending November 10, 2011 in Athens, Georgia. It was also announced that Cook’s second single "Fade into Me" would be released to coincide with the tour. Cook tweeted that there would be "more dates/info to come" In this tour, Devin Bronson replaced Neal Tiemann as the lead guitarist.
2012-present: Departure from RCA and third studio album.
On May 10, 2012, Cook performed a new song entitled "The Last Song I'll Write for You" on the eleventh season of "American Idol". Before the performance, Cook confirmed to Shirley Halperin of the "Hollywood Reporter" that he is without a recording contract, having departed from RCA, and is self-releasing "The Last Song I'll Write for You". On April 30, 2013, Cook released a new single, "Laying Me Low", through XIX Recordings, the record label of "American Idol" creator Simon Fuller. He is currently in the middle of his third studio album and expects it to be released sometime in early 2014.
Other performances.
Cook appeared at the 2008 "Glamour" magazine Women of the Year Awards as a guest of Mary Steenburgen to surprise honoree Hillary Clinton, a fan of "American Idol". He sang one of Clinton's favorite songs, "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", which he also sang during the Top 3 week on "Idol".
Cook appeared in several promotions for the November 1st episode of "Saturday Night Live", hosted by Ben Affleck. Cook performed two songs on the program, the first "Light On" and the second "Declaration".
Cook performed on the American Music Red Carpet Live November 23, 2008, performing "Light On" and "Declaration".
In June, Cook performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Game 3 of the 2008 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers. Cook also performed with his brother Andrew during the opening weekend of the 2008 NFL season at a game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders.
Cook started 2009 by performing songs from his debut album for the troops during a USO tour, where he was able to visit seven bases.
On February 12, 2009, Cook appeared on the morning news program, "Good Morning America" and talked about Walt Disney World Resort's new attraction, "The American Idol Experience". He performed "Light On" and took the stage once again to perform "Go Your Own Way" by Fleetwood Mac with fellow "American Idol" winner Carrie Underwood. He and all the other six winners received a mic-shaped statue from the creator of the franchise, Simon Fuller to honor them for winning the competition.
On May 20, 2009, Cook returned to the "Idol" stage during the Grand Finale of American Idol (season 8) to perform his song "Permanent" in honor of his late brother Adam. The live version of the song was released to iTunes soon afterwards with 100% of the proceeds from downloads of it going to Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure (ABC2).
Cook performed Heroes and Declaration at the 2009 All-Star Game Home Run Derby on July 13. He wore an American League shirt to honor his favorite team the Kansas City Royals and made some jokes about it. He said that "it was just a huge amount of icing on the cake", to come back to his home state for an All-Star Game and that, "this is a trip, I'm a huge baseball fan, so to get to be here for All-Star Week and be involved it's massive."
On August 7, 2009, Cook performed the Fleetwood Mac hit "Little Lies" with "American Idol" season 8 winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert on ABC's Good Morning America's Summer Concert Series in Central Park.

On February 22, 2011, Cook tweeted 'Was just informed by TPTB that that "extra treat" I worked on last week will air on March 3!' on his Twitter page, and then revealed on March 3 that he recorded the send-off song for contestants of Season 10. He covered the Simple Minds hit song Don't You (Forget About Me) which would be played whenever a contestant on American Idol 10 is eliminated.
On April 6, 2012, Cook performed the National Anthem at the Los Angeles Angels opening baseball game against the Kansas City Royals.
Personal life.
In May 2008, Cook asked Season 2 "American Idol" alum and TV Guide Network correspondent Kimberly Caldwell for a dinner date while on the red carpet before the show's seventh season finale. During a radio interview with XL 106.7 on October 13, 2008, Cook revealed that he and Caldwell were "still seeing each other." In a November 2008 interview with "PEOPLE" magazine, Cook said his relationship with Caldwell was a "nice break from the chaos" of post-"Idol" fame. They ended their relationship in December 2008.
"People" reported on March 31, 2009 that David was canceling dates on his current tour due to "family matters". Cook's elder brother, Adam, had been diagnosed with brain cancer since 1998 and died on May 2, 2009. On May 3, 2009 at the "Race for Hope" in Washington, D.C., Cook announced the death of his brother during the awards speech, and saying he "couldn't imagine being anywhere else right now." He finished the 5k with a time of 28 minutes. His team raised $136,376.16 for the cause. Donations were accepted through September 30, 2009. On the finale of the 8th season of "American Idol", Cook sang his song "Permanent" in honor of his brother. Audio of the performance was made available on iTunes, and the proceeds from the sale of it were put toward brain cancer research.
His musical influences include Our Lady Peace, Alice in Chains, Big Wreck, Pearl Jam, Bon Jovi, Chris Cornell, The Goo Goo Dolls, Switchfoot, and Collective Soul. Immediately after winning American Idol, Cook was asked backstage by "Entertainment Weekly" who his top five favorite bands were.

Television program

A television program (television programme in the United Kingdom), also called television show, is a segment of content intended for broadcast on television. It may be a one-time production or part of a periodically recurring series.
A television series that is intended to comprise a limited number of episodes is usually called a miniseries or serial. Series without a fixed length are usually divided into "seasons" or "series", yearly or semiannual installments of new episodes. While there is no defined length, US industry practice tends to favor longer seasons than those of some other countries.
A one-time broadcast may be called a "special", or particularly in the UK a "special episode". A television film ("made-for-TV movie" or television movie), is a film that is initially broadcast on television rather than released in theaters or direct-to-video, although many successful TV movies are later released on DVD.
A program can be either recorded—as on video tape or other various electronic media forms—or considered live television.
Formats.
Television programming may be fictional (as in comedies and dramas), or non-fictional (as in documentary, news, and reality television). It may be topical (as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television movies), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series). They could be primarily instructional or educational, or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows.
A drama program usually features a set of actors in a somewhat familiar setting. The program follows their lives and their adventures. With the exception of soap operas, many shows especially before the 1980s, remained static without story arcs, the main characters and the premise changed little. If some change happened to the characters lives during the episode, it was usually undone by the end. (Because of this, the episodes could be broadcast in any order.) Since the 1980s, there are many series that feature progressive change to the plot, the characters, or both. For instance, "Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere" were two of the first American prime time drama television series to have this kind of dramatic structure while the later series, "Babylon 5", is an extreme example of such production that had a predetermined story running over its intended five season run. 
Common television program periods include regular broadcasts (like news), series (usually seasonal and ongoing with a duration of only a few episodes to many seasons), or miniseries, which is an extended film, usually with a small predetermined number of episodes and a set plot and timeline. Miniseries usually range from about 3 to 10 hours in length. In the UK, the term "miniseries" is only usually used in reference to imported programmes, and such short-run series are usually called "serials".
Until recently, all scripted shows began with a title sequence showing opening credits at the bottom lower third of the screen during the beginning, and included closing credits at the end of the show. Beginning in the 1990s, some shows began with a "cold open", followed by a title sequence and a commercial break. Many serial-type shows begin with a "Previously on…" (such as the series "24") introduction before the new episode. And, to save time, some shows omit the title sequence altogether, folding the names normally featured there into the opening credits.
While series appearing on networks are usually commissioned by those networks, their producers earn greater revenue when the program is sold into syndication. With the rise of the DVD home video format, box sets containing entire seasons or the complete run of a program have become a significant revenue source as well. Many of the prime-time comedy shows and Saturday morning cartoons were digitally remastered for U.S. television around mid-May 2008, as there are more original and reissued DVD sets of television programs containing either entire seasons or complete series to come. Typically, a DVD of a series or TV movie may contain extended or additional scenes not shown during the broadcast, scenes not allowed for broadcast (due to censorship rule), or additional background information/documentaries.
In 2012, it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies' revenues than film. Some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs. In 2012, Academy-Award winning film director Steven Soderbergh, commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative, stated: "I think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television."
Development.
United States.
When a person or company decides to create a new series, they develop the show's elements, consisting of the concept, the characters, the crew, and cast. Then they offer ("pitch") it to the various networks in an attempt to find one interested enough to order a prototype first episode of the series, known as a "pilot." Eric Coleman, an animation executive at Disney, told an interviewer, "One misconception is that it’s very difficult to get in and pitch your show, when the truth is that development executives at networks want very much to hear ideas. They want very much to get the word out on what types of shows they’re looking for."
To create the pilot, the structure and team of the whole series must be put together. If the network likes the pilot, they pick up the show to air it the next season (usually Fall). Sometimes they save it for mid-season, or request rewrites and further review (known in the industry as "development hell"). Other times, they "pass" entirely, forcing the show's creator to "shop it around" to other networks. Many shows never make it past the pilot stage.
If the show is picked up, the network orders a "run" of episodes—usually only 13 episodes at first, though a season typically consists of at least 22 episodes. (The last nine episodes are sometimes called the "back nine"—borrowing the colloquial golf term).
The show hires a stable of writers, who usually work in parallel: the first writer works on the first episode, the second on the second episode, etc. When all the writers have been used, episode assignment starts again with the first writer. On other shows, however, the writers work as a team. Sometimes they develop story ideas individually, and pitch them to the show's creator, who folds them together into a script and rewrites them.
United Kingdom.
In contrast to the US model illustrated above, the UK procedure is operated on a sometimes similar, but much smaller scale.
The method of "team writing" is employed on some longer dramatic series (usually running up to a maximum of around 13 episodes). The idea for such a programme may be generated "in-house" by one of the networks; it could originate from an independent production company; it sometimes is a product of both. For example, the BBC's long-running soap opera "EastEnders" is wholly a BBC production, whereas its popular drama "Life on Mars" was developed by Kudos in association with the broadcaster.
However, there are still a significant number of programmes (usually sitcoms) that are built around just one or two writers and a small, close-knit production team. These are "pitched" in the traditional way, but since the creator(s) handle all the writing requirements, there is a run of six or seven episodes per series once approval has been given. Many of the most popular British comedies have been made this way, including "Monty Python's Flying Circus" (albeit with an exclusive team of six writer-performers), "Fawlty Towers", "Blackadder" and "The Office".
Production.
The executive producer, often the show's creator, is in charge of running the show. They pick the crew and help cast the actors, approve and sometimes write series plots (some even write or direct major episodes). Various other producers help to ensure that the show runs smoothly.
As with filmmaking or other electronic media production, producing of an individual episode can be divided into three parts. These are:
Pre-production.
Pre-production begins when a script is approved. A director is chosen to plan the episode's final look.
Pre-production tasks include storyboarding, construction of sets, props, and costumes, casting guest stars, budgeting, acquiring resources like lighting, special effects, stunts, etc. Once the show is planned, it must then be scheduled; scenes are often filmed out of sequence, guest actors or even regulars may only be available at certain times. Sometimes the principal photography of different episodes must be done at the same time, complicating the schedule (a guest star might shoot scenes from two episodes on the same afternoon). Complex scenes are translated from storyboard to animatics to further clarify the action. Scripts are adjusted to meet altering requirements.
Some shows have a small stable of directors, but also usually rely on outside directors. Given the time constraints of broadcasting, a single show might have two or three episodes in pre-production, one or two episodes in principal photography, and a few more in various stages of post-production. The task of directing is complex enough that a single director can usually not work on more than one episode or show at a time, hence the need for multiple directors.
Principal photography.
Principal photography is the actual filming of the episode. Director, actors and crew gather at a television studio or on location for filming or videoing a scene. A scene is further divided into shots, which should be planned during pre-production. Depending on scheduling, a scene may be shot in non-sequential order of the story. Conversations may be filmed twice from different camera angles, often using stand-ins, so one actor might perform all their lines in one set of shots, and then the other side of the conversation is filmed from the opposite perspective. To complete a production on time, a second unit may be filming a different scene on another set or location at the same time, using a different set of actors, an assistant director, and a second unit crew. A director of photography supervises the lighting of each shot to ensure consistency.
Post production.
Once principal photography is complete, producers coordinate tasks to begin the video editing. Visual and digital video effects are added to the film; this is often outsourced to companies specializing in these areas. Often music is performed with the conductor using the film as a time reference (other musical elements may be previously recorded). An editor cuts the various pieces of film together, adds the musical score and effects, determines scene transitions, and assembles the completed show.
Budgets and revenues.
Most television networks throughout the world are 'commercial', dependent on selling advertising time or acquiring sponsors. Broadcasting executives' main concern over their programming is on audience size. Once the number of 'free to air' stations was restricted by the availability of channel frequencies, but cable TV (outside the USA, satellite television) technology has allowed an expansion in the number of channels available to viewers (sometimes at premium rates) in a much more competitive environment.
In the United States, the average broadcast network drama costs $3 million an episode to produce, while cable dramas cost $2 million on average. The pilot episode may be more expensive than a regular episode. In 2004, "Losts two-hour pilot cost $10–$14 million, in 2008 "Fringes two-hour pilot cost $10 million, and in 2010, "Boardwalk Empire" was $18 million for the first episode. In 2011, "Game of Thrones" was $5–$10 million, "Pan Am" cost an estimated $10 million, while "Terra Nova"'s two-hour pilot was between $10 to $20 million.
Many scripted network television shows in the United States are financed through Deficit financing: a studio finances the production cost of a show and a network pays a license fee to the studio for the right to air the show. This license fee does not cover the show's production costs, leading to the deficit. Although the studio does not make its money back in the original airing of the show, it retains ownership of the show. This ownership retention allows the studio to make its money back and earn a profit through syndication and DVD and Blu-ray disc sales. This system places most of the financial risk on the studios, however a show that is a hit in the syndication and home video markets can more than make up for the misses. Although the deficit financing system places minimal financial risk on the networks, they lose out on the future profits of big hits, since they are only licensing the shows.
Costs are recouped mainly by advertising revenues for broadcast networks and some cable channels, while other cable channels depend on subscription revenues. In general, advertisers, and consequently networks that depend on advertising revenues, are more interested in the number of viewers within the 18–49 age range than the total number of viewers. Advertisers are willing to pay more to advertise on shows successful with young adults because they watch less television and are harder to reach than older adults. According to "Advertising Age", during the 2007–08 season, "Grey's Anatomy" was able to charge $419,000 per commercial, compared to only $248,000 for a commercial during "", despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average. Due to its strength in young demos, "Friends" was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial as "Murder, She Wrote", even though the two series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together. "Glee" and "The Office" drew fewer total viewers than "NCIS" during the 2009–10 season, but earned an average of $272,694 and $213,617 respectively, compared to $150,708 for NCIS.
Distribution.
After production, the show is turned over to the television network, which sends it out to its affiliate stations, which broadcast it in the specified broadcast programming time slot. If the Nielsen ratings are good, the show is kept alive as long as possible. If not, the show is usually canceled. The show's creators are then left to shop around remaining episodes, and the possibility of future episodes, to other networks. On especially successful series, the producers sometimes call a halt to a series on their own like "Seinfeld", "The Cosby Show", "Corner Gas", and "M*A*S*H" and end it with a concluding episode, which sometimes is a big series finale.
On rare occasions, a series that has not attracted particularly high ratings and has been canceled can be given a reprieve if DVD sales have been particularly strong. This has happened in the cases of "Family Guy" in the US and "Peep Show" in the UK.
If the show is popular or lucrative, and a number of episodes (usually 100 episodes or more) are made, it goes into broadcast syndication (in the USA) where broadcast to the program rights are then resold.
Seasons/series.
The terminology used to define a set of episodes produced by a television series varies from country to country.
North American usage.
In North American television, a series is a connected set of television program episodes that run under the same title, possibly spanning many seasons. Since the late 1960s, this programming schedule typically includes between 20 and 26 episodes. (Before then, a regular television season could average out to at least 30 episodes.) Up until the 1980s, most (but certainly not all) new programs for the broadcast networks debuted in the "Fall Season", which ran from September through March and nominally contained from 24 to 26 episodes. These episodes were rebroadcast during the Spring (or Summer) Season, from April through August. Because of cable television and the Nielsen sweeps, the "fall" season now normally extends to May. Thus, a "full season" on a broadcast network now usually runs from September through May for at least 22 episodes.
A full season is sometimes split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the calendar year, such as the first season of "Jericho" on CBS. When this split occurs, the last half of the episodes sometimes are referred to with the letter B as in "The last nine episodes (of 'the Sopranos') will be part of what is being called either "Season 6, Part 2" or "Season 6B," Since the 1990s, these shorter seasons also have been referred to as ".5" or half seasons, where the run of shows between September and December is labeled "Season X", and the second run between January and May labeled "Season X.5". This is typically done to increase DVD sales of the show. Distributors release the first half of the season in stores just before the second half first airs to increase interest in the season's second half. Examples of this include the 2004 incarnation of "Battlestar Galactica", ABC's "FlashForward", and ABC Family's "Make It or Break It".
Nowadays, a new series is often ordered (funded) for just the first 10 to 13 episodes, to gauge the audience interest. If it is "picked up", the season is completed to the regular 20 to 26 episodes. A midseason replacement is an inexpensive short-run (10–13 episode) show designed to take the place of an original series that failed to garner an audience and has not been picked up. A "series finale" is the last show of the series before the show is no longer produced. (In the UK, it means the end of a season, what is known in the US as a ""season" finale").
UK and Australia usage.
In the United Kingdom and other countries, these sets of episodes are referred to as a "series". In Australia, the broadcasting may be different from North American usage, however, the terms "series" and "season" are the same. For example, "Battlestar Galactica" has an original series as well as a remake, both are considered different series with their own number of individual seasons. It helps to avoid much confusion when talking about a TV series.
Australian television does not follow "seasons" in the way that U.S. television does; for example, there is no "fall season" or "fall schedule". For many years, popular nighttime dramas in Australia would run for much of the year, and would only go into recess during the summer period (December–February), when ratings are not taken. Therefore popular dramas would usually run from February through November each year. This schedule was used in the 1970s for popular dramas including "Number 96". Typically, a drama or soap opera such as "Home and Away" would begin a new season in late January and the season finale would air in late November, with 220–230 episodes per season. During the Olympics, however, "Home and Away" would often go on hiatus, which is referred to as an "Olympic cliffhanger". Australian situation comedy series' seasons are approximately 13 episodes long and premiere anytime in between February and November.
British shows have tended toward shorter series in recent years. For example, the first series of long-running science fiction show "Doctor Who" in 1963 featured forty-two 25‑minute episodes, which had been reduced gradually to fourteen 25‑minute episodes in 1989. The revival of "Doctor Who" has comprised thirteen 45‑minute installments. However, there are some series in the UK that have a larger number of episodes, for example "Waterloo Road" started with 8 to 12 episodes but from series three onward, it increased to 20 episodes, and series seven will contain 30 episodes. Recently, American non-cable networks have also begun to experiment with shorter series for some programs, particularly reality shows such as "Survivor". However, they often air two series per year, resulting in roughly the same number of episodes per year as a drama.
This is a reduction from the 1950s, in which many American shows (e.g., "The Twilight Zone") had between 29 and 39 episodes per season. Actual storytelling time within a commercial television hour has also gradually reduced over the years, from 50 minutes out of every 60 to the current 44 (and even less on some networks), beginning in the early 21st century.
In the United States, dramas produced for hour-long time slots typically are 39 to 42 minutes in length (excluding advertisements), while sitcoms produced for 30-minute time slots typically are 18 to 21 minutes long. There are exceptions as subscription-based TV channels (like Showtime) have episodes with 45 to 48 minutes of program, similar to Britain.
In Britain dramas run from about 45 to 48 minutes, with 57 to 59 minutes on BBC1. Sitcoms vary greatly and are between 22 to 27 minutes generally and 27 to 29 minutes on BBC1. The longer duration on the national television channels (BBC1 and BBC2) is due to the lack of advertising, requiring time only for bridging commentary and trailers in each programme slot.

Indian River (Stevens poem)

"Indian River" is a poem from Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry, "Harmonium." It was first published in 1917. Absent from the first edition of 1923, it appeared in the second edition of 1931. It is in the public domain.
The linked prepositional phrases oblige the reader to construct complex visual images of the Floridian scenes, and the focus on jingling in each sentence brings sound to the images as well. The similarity of syntactic structure in the first three sentences induces an almost hypnotic effect, like repetition of a mantra. The final sentence may betray the poet's diffidence about the prospects for renewal, as in Depression Before Spring, or, as Cook suggests, it may simply reflect Stevens's belief that Florida had no spring.

Georgie Gent

Georgina "Georgie" Gent "(formerly Stoop)" (born 13 January 1988) is an English, AEGON Award winning professional tennis player coached by Damien Roberts. She has won two ITF singles titles, two ITF doubles titles and reached a career-high singles ranking of world no. 178 so far in her career.
Personal life.
Stoop's parents are named Angus and Tessa and she has three older siblings, Sam, Olly and Milly, who she used to play tennis against. Her mother, Tessa, an interior designer spent time with her children playing tennis during their childhood. She first began playing tennis at the age of 5 but enjoys all other sports as well, particularly hockey. After attending St Faith's School, she was selected to be educated at the Leys School while being coached by national coaches, and left school when she was sixteen. In 2008, Stoop's mother re-married and in 2010 Stoop changed her surname to her mother's new married name, to be known as Georgie Gent.
Career.
Junior (2003–2006).
Stoop's first match on the ITF junior circuit was in February 2003. In only the second junior tournament of her career (the "Team Leschly Danish Junior Cup"), she won two matches to qualify and then four more to reach the final; a marathon match which she eventually lost, 7–6(11) 6–7(3) 5–7. She reached one more final over the course of her junior career (in the "Nottingham ITF" tournament in August 2004) where she also lost. Her overall win-loss record in singles was 27–19.
She had less success in doubles, only reaching two quarterfinals (both with Laura Peterzan) over the course of her career and never passing this stage. Her doubles win-loss record was 6–16. She reached a career-high combined singles and doubles ranking of world No.234 on 1 August 2005.
2005–2007.
Stoop's first professional match win came in May 2005 in the $10,000 ITF tournament where she reached the final before losing to Gaelle Widmer from Switzerland in straight sets, 3–6 2–6. She played seven more ITF tournaments that year but won only two more matches. She finished the year with a ranking of No.903.
2006 started slowly for Stoop up until April when she reached the semi-finals of the ITF $10,000 tournament in Bath. She continued playing on the ITF tour, reaching two more quarter-finals, until June when she was awarded a wild card into the tier II International Women's Open qualifying event in Eastbourne, England. She was beaten without winning a single game by Japan's Akiko Morigami who was ranked 69 at the time, 553 places above Stoop. This wild card was followed by another, this time into the qualifying tournament of her home Grand Slam, Wimbledon, where she was beaten by Stéphanie Cohen-Aloro, 2–6 2–6. After this her ranking rose steadily as she played out the rest of the year on the ITF tour. She reached one more semi-final and three more finals, losing in two of them but winning the last as a qualifier in the $25,000 event in Nuriootpa, Australia. She ended the 2006 season ranked No.412.
In her first tournament of 2007, Stoop reached the quarter-final of the $10,000 ITF event in Stuttgart, Germany. She reached the final of the $25,000 event in La Palma, Spain in March where she lost to María Emilia Salerni, 3–6 3–6. She did not play again after this until October, after which she reached two more quarterfinals in $25,000 events held in Istanbul and Mount Gambier, losing to Monica Niculescu both times. Her year-end ranking for 2007 was world No.306.
2008.
Stoop reached two more ITF quarter-finals in the first half of 2008 before being given a wild card into the tier II International Women's Open in Eastbourne where she came up against top-40 player Kaia Kanepi from Estonia in the first round. She put up a good fight, winning a first set tie break before losing the next two sets, 7–6(6) 1–6 5–7. Her next wild card was into the qualifying tournament of Wimbledon where she also lost in the first round. Her third consecutive wild card was into the tier II Bank of the West Classic qualifying tournament and it proved more fruitful than her previous two. She won two matches in three sets before falling to Michelle Larcher De Brito in the final round of qualifying, 4–6 0–6. After this she reached three more ITF quarterfinals (one of them as a qualifier at the $75,000 event in Albuquerque, New Mexico) and two more ITF finals (in $25,000 Coimbra and $50,000 Troy) where she was beaten by Nicole Thyssen from the Netherlands and Anna Tatishvili from Georgia respectively. In October, Stoop reached the quarter-finals of the $50,000 ITF tournament in Pittsburgh, USA where she lost to No.6 seed Varvara Lepchenko. Her final world ranking of 2008 was No.208.
2009.
Stoop began her 2009 season by attempting to qualify for the Australian Open. She beat American Alexa Glatch in the first round before falling to Kathrin Wörle in a three-set battle, 3–6 7–5 12–14. In February and March she reached two ITF quarterfinals and one semifinal before heading to Paris to attempt to qualify for the French Open. She was beaten by Petra Martić in the first round of qualifying, 5–7 5–7. In June she received three consecutive wild cards into WTA tournaments, the first of which was into the main draw of the Aegon Classic in Birmingham where compatriot Elena Baltacha defeated her in two sets in the first round. She then competed in the qualifying draw for the Aegon International but again did not win a match, losing to Ekaterina Makarova, 4–6 6–7(2). Her third of three consecutive wild cards allowed Stoop entry into the main draw of Wimbledon for the first time in her career. She came up against No.7 seed Vera Zvonareva in the first round. Stoop almost caused a huge upset by coming close to defeating the Russian, however she eventually lost, 6–7(0) 6–4 4–6. However she did team up with Laura Robson in the doubles to face Jade Curtis and Anna Smith, a match which they won in an epic three sets, 6–4 3–6 13–11. Stoop and Robson went on to lose to Grand Slam champions Amélie Mauresmo and Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round. After Wimbledon, Stoop reached one more ITF quarterfinal and won her second title, beating Katie O'Brien in an all-British final at the $25,000 event in Vigo, Spain.

John Sullivan (1960s catcher)

John Peter Sullivan (born January 3, 1941, at Somerville, New Jersey) is a retired American catcher and coach in Major League Baseball. A left-handed batter who threw right-handed, Sullivan stood 6' (183 cm) tall and weighed 195 pounds (89 kg) as an active player.
After graduating from Bernards High School, Sullivan signed with the Detroit Tigers in 1959 and made his debut with them in the waning days of the season. He played in five major league seasons with Detroit (1963–65), the New York Mets () and Philadelphia Phillies (), appearing in 116 games, with 59 hits in 259 at bats, batting .228 with two home runs and 18 runs batted in. His only substantial terms of MLB service were as a reserve catcher for the 1965 Tigers and 1967 Mets, for whom he played his only full season in MLB. He played eight years at the Triple-A level.
Sullivan began managing in minor league baseball in 1973 in the Kansas City Royals' farm system. During six seasons, he rose from Rookie ball to Triple-A, winning four league championships and compiling a stellar .601 winning percentage (434 victories and 288 defeats). His only under .500 club, the 1978 Omaha Royals, who finished 66–69, nevertheless topped their division and defeated the Indianapolis Indians for the American Association championship.
In 1979, Sullivan began a 15-year run as a Major League coach, serving with the Royals (1979), Atlanta Braves (1980–81) and Toronto Blue Jays (1982–93). He was brought to Toronto by Bobby Cox after Cox' first term as Braves' manager, and remained with the club under Cox successors Jimy Williams and Cito Gaston, coaching on the Blue Jays' 1992 and 1993 World Series championship teams. His final game was Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, and his retirement was announced at the Blue Jays' championship celebration. Sullivan was asked to unveil the 1993 World Series Championship banner at the end of festivities.

He Jianjun (; born 1960 in Beijing ) is a Chinese film director and screenwriter. A graduate of the Beijing Film Academy, He is considered a leading voice in the so-called "Sixth Generation." He is occasionally credited under the name "He Yi."
Career.
He Jianjun began his film career like many of his contemporaries at the Beijing Film Academy, China's premiere film school. Upon graduating in 1990, as well as a screenwriter for Chen Kaige's "King of the Children" (1987), before his debut film, "Red Beads", was released in 1993 to strong reviews in the west. Filmed in only twelve days, "Red Beads" was based on the experiences of one of He's classmates, who had a psychotic break.
While "Red Beads" would win a FIPRESCI award in the 1993 International Film Festival Rotterdam, the film also caught the wrath of Chinese censors, who blacklisted He Jianjun in 1994 along with several other prominent filmmakers, including Tian Zhuangzhuang, Wang Xiaoshuai, Wu Wenguang, Zhang Yuan, and Ning Dai.
Because of the blacklisting, He Jianjun had to smuggle out his next film, "Postman" for post-production.

Mainul Haque

Mainul Haque, commonly known as Mainu, was a Bangladeshi cricketer who played for the Bangladesh side in the famous cricket match against the MCC at Dhaka in 1976-77. In the following season, against Sri Lanka he acted as the Vice Captain of the side, helping Raquibul Hasan. A right-handed middle-order batsman, he scored 39 at Faridpur and 43 at Chittagong against Sri Lanka . In February 1978, he shared a century partnership with Raquibul Hasan against the touring Decan Blues side from India.
An early retirement.
Mainul went abroad immediately after the 1978 season, thus abruptly ending his international career. The main reason behind his decision was that Bangladesh cricket at the time was very much at the amateur stage. Even the top cricketers were poorly paid. All of them were involved in other professional activities. Apart from Mainu, a number of other national cricketers (Nazrul Kader Lintu, Nazim Shiraji, Asadduzzaman Misha, Nehal Hasnain, just to name a few) gave their careers greater importance over cricket.
Domestic cricket.
He played most of his domestic cricket with the Mohammedan Sporting Club of Dhaka.

<doc id="19508868" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19508868" title="ENOS Rescue-System">
ENOS Rescue-System

ENOS stands for "Elektronisches Notruf- und Ortungssystem" - "Electronic Rescue and Location System" - a system developed in Germany for use by divers at sea. ENOS allows people in distress to signal their location when drifting on the ocean’s surface so they can be quickly located and rescued. Although the system was especially developed for scuba diving it can also be used for other water sports like windsurfing, jet skiing, sailing and boating.
Assembly and Operation.
Each ENOS unit consists of two parts. The ENOS-Receiver which is kept on board the dive boat; and the ENOS-Transmitter(s) carried by the diver(s).
ENOS is designed for emergencies associated with a diver(s) surfacing too far from the boat to swim back. For example, when divers have been swept away from their vessel by a current or when they can’t see the boat because of poor weather. 
To send an emergency signal, the diver switches on the transmitter. This will send the signal and the diver’s GPS position back to the boat’s receiver. 
When the receiver picks up the diver’s alert, it automatically determines the boat’s GPS position and calculates the vessel’s distance and bearing to the diver’s position. The results are clearly plotted on screen for the skipper to follow during the rescue.
Technology and Receiving Range.
Every ENOS is a self-contained rescue system that functions in a local area. Its range is determined by the height of the receiving antenna mounted on the dive boat, the prevailing surface conditions and the distance of the direct line-of-sight. Receiving ranges of up to three nautical miles are standard. A range of up to six nautical miles is possible in optimal conditions.
The system uses radio frequencies that do not require licenses or fees; and are determined by the national laws of radio frequencies where the system is operating. It does not use the international distress frequency.
ENOS is the only rescue system for water sports which relays the GPS position of the diver in distress directly to a local receiving unit. The alert is not relayed to coast guards or other marine rescue organisations.
The receiver is alerted immediately which enables the near-by boat to quickly and independently initiate the diver rescue and bear the costs. 
A single ENOS-Receiver can receive alerts from all the ENOS-Transmitters operating on the same frequency within the same receiving range.
Other Rescue Systems.
The ENOS-System is not intended to replace existing distress radio beacons or rescue systems (e.g. EPIRBs, ELTs, PLBs, Inmarsat etc.), which operate on international emergency frequencies and over large distances.
Circulation.
The ENOS-System was developed in Rösrath, Germany in 2004. It can be used anywhere in the world and is currently operating on dive boats in Egypt, Ecuador / Galápagos, European Union, Maldives, Seychelles .

Kolibri (sailing boat)

The kolibri 560 is a Dutch cabin sailing boat designed in 1963 by G.A. Pfeiffer and built by Antoon van den Brink and his sons. 
The boats were a great success because they were sold as a self building package which made them affordable for a lot of people. The building packages were sold until the early 1980s and delivery periods of one year were the norm. The kolibri 560 is a 5.60 m long, 2.00 m wide with a depth of 1.00 m, sailing boat which is unsinkable, has a self draining tub and is sea worthy. Four people can sleep in this boat and it was presented at the HISWA exposition (a Dutch boat exposition) in 1964. Over a thousand were sold. In 2007 a polyester version was developed and was nicknamed Polybri.
Features.
The kolibri 560 has a wide cabin and an interior that was designed while using it, which has made it an optimal design. This boat has room for four people to sleep, a toilet, and large depository. Even a small kitchenette is built-in. The boat was first used as a real family boat in the 1970s but now solo and duo sailers also discovered this small but fast sailing boat.

Lars Anderson (baseball)

Lars Anderson (born September 25, 1987) is an American professional baseball first baseman for the Chicago Cubs organization. He played for the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball from 2010 through 2012.
High school.
Anderson attended Jesuit High School in Sacramento, California. In his senior season he hit over .400 with 14 home runs in 29 games. He committed to attend the University of California, Berkeley on a scholarship that would allow him to play college baseball for the California Golden Bears baseball team.
Draft.
Coming into the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft, Anderson was considered an early round talent, but dropped to the 18th round due to signability issues. He agreed to an $825,000 signing bonus with the Red Sox, equivalent to the suggested bonus for a first round supplemental pick.
Minor Leagues.
He made his professional debut in April 2007 with the Greenville Drive. "He really understands the strike zone well, and he recognizes balls and strikes early," said Gabe Kapler, the former Sox outfielder who was Anderson's manager at Greenville. "e was way ahead of the game because he was already recognizing balls and strikes and had a plan, an approach at the plate that was advanced. He had planned on not swinging at breaking balls until he had two strikes on him."
In September 2008, Anderson was named the Minor League Offensive Player of the Year for the Red Sox, following a season of a combined 18 home runs and 80 runs batted in while hitting over .300 for both the Lancaster JetHawks and Portland Sea Dogs.
In 2009, his first full season at AA Portland, Anderson struggled, batting just .233 with 9 home runs and 51 RBI.
Anderson started the 2010 season with the Sea Dogs. He was promoted to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox on April 29 after hitting .355 with five home runs and 15 RBIs in 17 games in Portland, and batted .262 with 10 home runs and 53 RBIs in 113 games. 
Despite making his major league debut in September 2010, Anderson returned to Pawtucket for the 2011 season and batted .265 with 14 home runs and 78 RBIs. On July 30, 2011, Anderson was nearly traded to his hometown Oakland Athletics, along with a player to be named later for starting pitcher Rich Harden. However, the deal fell through, with the Red Sox citing issues with Harden's health.
Major Leagues.
Boston Red Sox.
Anderson made his major league debut with Red Sox on September 6, 2010. He then replaced Mike Lowell at first base in the 5th inning of Lowell's last major league game on October 2, 2010, designated "Mike Lowell Day" by the Red Sox. In 18 appearances Anderson had 7 hits in 35 at-bats, with 4 RBIs.
Anderson appeared in 6 games in September 2011 as a defensive replacement and pinch runner, scoring twice as a pinch runner.
On April 22, 2012 Anderson was again called up to the majors after Jason Repko was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He was then optioned on May 2 to make room for Will Middlebrooks.
Arizona Diamondbacks.
The Red Sox traded Anderson to the Cleveland Indians for Steven Wright on July 31, 2012. On December 11, 2012, the Indians traded Anderson to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team trade.
Chicago White Sox.
The Diamondbacks designated Anderson for assignment on January 24, 2013. He was claimed off waivers by the Chicago White Sox, and placed on their 40 man roster on February 1. After being designated for assignment by the White Sox, Anderson was claimed by the Toronto Blue Jays on February 25. Anderson was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays on March 29, 2013. After clearing waivers, Anderson was traded by the Blue Jays to the Chicago White Sox for cash on April 1. Anderson was assigned to the White Sox Triple-A affiliate Charlotte Knights.
On July 18, 2013, Anderson was released from the Minors.
Chicago Cubs.
On January 24, 2014, he signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs.

WAGR E class

The WAGR E class were a type of sixty-five steam-locomotives built for the Western Australian Government Railways narrow-gauge network by three British manufacturers Nasmyth, Wilson and Company, Vulcan Foundry, and the North British Locomotive Company, from 1902. The locomotives provided a huge increase in locomotive power available to the WAGR and were the mainstay traction of WAGR passenger services for two decades. The Es class was the name given to a reconstruction of all but four of the class carried out between 1924 and 1925.
Background.
In the early 20th Century, the WAGR was using a wide range of locomotives for a variety of operational roles. One type of locomotive lacking, however, was a dedicated long-distance of express passenger locomotive. The R class engines of 1897 had not proved appropriate for the steep gradients made necessary by the crossing of the Darling Scarp, due to their lack of power. In 1902 an order was placed with a number of different locomotive construction companies in England, the Nasmyth, Wilson and Company, Vulcan Foundry, and North British Locomotive for 65 4-6-2 "Pacific" type. These became the WAGR E class locomotives and were the first 4-6-2 locomotives in Australia.
Es class.
Sixty-one of these locomotives were rebuilt as Es class in 1924/1925; one example has been preserved. The E and Es class revolutionised the long-distance travel between Perth and Kalgoolie. They were later replaced on this service by the P class in 1924 and again by the Pr class 
- arguably the most successful and handsome WAGR designs - in 1938.
Operational history.
Construction and Introduction.
Due to slow delivery times by the British Companies as a result of full-order books and a preference for larger orders, twenty modified E class locomotives were ordered from the United States and became the WAGR Ec class. They differed from the E class in that they were compound engines. The E class eventually totalled sixty-five in number, with 30 examples being built by the Vulcan Foundry, 20 by North British and 15 by Nasmyth, Wilson. The first fifteen entered service between 1903/04 and were successful from the outset, providing a much needed boost to WAGR locomotive power.

The Cunninghams (band)

The Cunninghams are a Canadian band, originally formed in Summer 2007 in Toronto. Described as "The First Family of Rock and Roll", The Cunninghams have made two EPs, "That Oughtta Hold'em", released independently in 2008, and "High Class Rock and Roll", released independently in 2009.
The band achieved national recognition when they won the cross-Canada contest held by the Mazda Muzik Tour and later that year The Cunninghams had the honour to open for Sam Roberts Band at The Opera House in Toronto on April 8, 2008.
In 2011, the band released the singles "You Don't Know" and "I, I, I". Following the release of the new singles, the band's original drummer, Regibald Cunningham, left the band and was subsequently replaced by Colonel Cunningham. Soon after, the band recorded their most recent single, "20CCB", which was produced by Mike Langford at The Pawnshop Studio in Toronto. In November 2011, Clapsbury Cunningham (bass) announced his departure from the band. Since then, the band has operated as a three-piece and continues to write new material. In 2012, The Cunninghams played Toronto's CMW and NXNE festivals. The band will be going back into the studio in August 2013 to record a brand new EP.

Big Orange (South Australia)

The Big Orange is one of a number of Big Things to be found in Australia, and is located near the Riverland town of Berri in South Australia. Standing at 15 metres in height, with a diameter of 12 metres, it is the biggest of the "big fruit" in Australia, and incorporates a cafe, souvenir shop, function room, lookout and a 360 degree mural within the structure. Opened in 1980, the landmark has at times struggled to find commercial success, changing hands in 2000, 2006 and again in 2008. Nevertheless, it has been described as the "most defining icon of the region".
History.
The Big Orange was conceived by Bronte Coombe, Ven Chubb and David Marshall. The three invested $145,000 into the venture in the mid-1970s, and the Big Orange opened on 14 January 1980. At the time it was claimed to be the "largest sphere in the southern hemisphere", and Bronte Combe is quoted as stating that it was the only big thing at the time that had a business conducted from within it.
In 2002 the Big Orange was sold for between $100,000 and $120,000 to RivSkills, an employment and training agency. They operated the attraction as an Enterprise Learning Center, but two years later the Big Orange was forced to close, with the owners citing "financial losses and management issues" as contributing factors.
Two years after it closed, in 2006, the Big Orange was purchased by Kevin Dickerson. The Cooltong-based horticulturist planned to expand the property, but a combination of rising fuel prices and the drought saw problems emerge with the business, to the point where the Big Orange was no longer "a viable part of his business plan". The site ended up in the hands of liquidators, and on 29 October 2008 the site was due to go to auction. Options for potential buyers provided by the liquidator include buying the Big Orange, the land, and the water entitlement separately, and it was suggested the buyers might consider rejuvenating the landmark by turning it into a "big golf ball with sponsors' names painted on it". Although the October auction was unsuccessful, with the Big Orange failing to attract any bids, the site was subsequently sold in November to a local businessman. According to the agent who handled the sale, the new owner intends for the Big Orange to remain at the current site, and plans to once again open it to the public.
Design and construction.
The Big Orange was designed by Adelaide based Architect John Twopenny and constructed by Hoffmann Engineering. It stands at 15 metres in height, and has a 12 metre diameter, making it the largest of the big things in Australia based upon fruit. It is constructed of fibreglass panels surrounded a steel frame, and weighs in the vicinity of 85 tonnes.
A footbridge is used to access the main structure, within which can be found four levels. The first contains a function room, the second a combination souvenir shop and cafe, while the third level possesses a 360 degree mural depicting the local scenery. The fourth floor has a lookout providing a view of the surrounding orchards.

Piano Sonata No. 1 (Brahms)

The Piano Sonata No. 1 in C major, Op. 1, of Johannes Brahms was written in Hamburg in 1853, and published later that year. Despite being his first published work, he had actually composed his second piano sonata first, but chose this work to be his first published opus because he felt that it was of higher quality. The piece was sent along with his second sonata to Breitkopf & Härtel with a letter of recommendation from Robert Schumann. Schumann had already praised Brahms enthusiastically, and the sonata shows signs of an effort to impress in it's technical demands and dramatic character. It was dedicated to Joseph Joachim.
The sonata is in four movements:
The first movement is in conventional sonata form with a repeated exposition. The opening of the first theme resembles the opening of Beethoven's "Hammerklavier" sonata. The second movement is a theme and variations inspired by the song "Verstohlen geht der Mond auf". Brahms was to rewrite it for female chorus in 1859 (WoO 38/20). The third movement is a scherzo and trio. The fourth is a loose rondo whose theme is noticeably changed at every recurrence.

Piano Sonata No. 2 (Brahms)

The Piano Sonata No. 2 in F-sharp minor, Op. 2 of Johannes Brahms was written in Hamburg, Germany in 1853, and published the year after. Despite being his second published work, it was actually composed before his first piano sonata, but was published later because Brahms recognized the importance of an inaugural publication and felt that the C major sonata was of higher quality. It was sent along with his first sonata to Breitkopf und Härtel with a letter of recommendation from Robert Schumann. Schumann had already praised Brahms enthusiastically, and the sonata shows signs of an effort to impress, with its technical demands and highly dramatic nature. It was dedicated to Clara Schumann.
The sonata is in four movements:
The first movement is in the conventional sonata-allegro form. The second movement is a theme and variations based on the German Minnesang "Mir ist leide." Like the theme and variations of the first sonata, the variations move from the minor mode to the parallel major. The third movement is a scherzo and trio whose beginning theme is almost identical to that of the second movement. The finale begins with a brief introduction in A major, the relative major of F sharp minor. The main subject of the introduction serves as the first theme of this movement, which is in sonata form and contains a repeated exposition. The coda of the finale, marked pianissimo and to be played with the soft pedal, returns to and expands upon material from the movement's introduction.

<doc id="19509478" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19509478" title="Multibrot set">
Multibrot set

In mathematics, a multibrot set is the set of values in the complex plane whose absolute value remains below some finite value throughout iterations by a member of the general monic univariate polynomial family of recursions 
where "d" ≥ 2. The exponent "d" may be further generalized to negative and fractional values.
Examples.
The case of
is the classic Mandelbrot set from which the name is derived. 
The sets for other values of "d" also show fractal images when they are plotted on the complex plane.
Each of the examples of various powers "d" shown below is plotted to the same scale. Values of "c" belonging to the set are black. Values of "c" that have unbounded value under recursion, and thus do not belong in the set, are plotted in different colours, that show as contours, depending on the number of recursions that caused a value to exceed a fixed magnitude in the Escape Time algorithm.
Positive powers.
The example is the original Mandelbrot set. The examples for are often called "Multibrot sets". These sets include the origin and have fractal perimeters, with rotational symmetry.
Negative powers.
When "d" is negative the set surrounds but does not include the origin. There is interesting complex behaviour in the contours between the set and the origin, in a star-shaped area with rotational symmetry. The sets appear to have a circular perimeter, however this is just an artifact of the fixed maximum radius allowed by the Escape Time algorithm, and is not a limit of the sets that actually extend in all directions to infinity.
Rendering images.
All the above images are rendered using an Escape Time algorithm that identifies points outside the set in a simple way. Much greater fractal detail is revealed by plotting the Lyapunov exponent, as shown by the example below. The Lyapunov exponent is the error growth-rate of a given sequence. First calculate the iteration sequence with "N" iterations, then calculate the exponent as
and if the exponent is negative the sequence is stable. The white pixels in the picture are the parameters "c" for which the exponent is positive aka unstable. The colours show the periods of the cycles which the orbits are attracted to. All points colored dark-blue (outside) are attracted by a fixed point, all points in the middle (lighter blue) are attracted by a period 2 cycle and so on.
Pseudocode.
The complex value "z" has coordinates ("x","y") on the complex plane and is raised to various powers inside the iteration loop by codes shown in this table. Powers not shown in the table can be obtained by concatenating the codes shown.

Turquoise Mountain Foundation

Turquoise Mountain Foundation (in Persian, Bonyad-e Firuzkuh) is a non-governmental organization operating in Afghanistan, legally established in Scotland as a component charity of The Prince's Charities. Based in Kabul, it has the three-fold objective of regenerating historic urban areas, renewing traditional Afghan arts and architecture, and spurring the sustainable development of the nation’s craft industry. It is named after Turquoise Mountain, the greatest indigenous Afghan capital of the Middle Ages.
The Turquoise Mountain Foundation was founded in 2006 at the request of HRH Prince Charles of Wales and HE Hamid Karzai, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, to create jobs, skills and a renewed sense of national identity. Rory Stewart was the Executive Chairman until shortly after his election to the UK Parliament in May 2010.
The charity's 2008 income was £4.1 million. Funding comes from a number of government agencies and private donors, including the Canadian International Development Agency, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of Afghanistan, the Government of India, the Blue Moon Fund, Reach Out To Asia, the Kathy Evans Afghan Education Trust, The Bonita Trust, The Prince's Charities, The Kingdom of Bahrain, HH The Amir of Kuwait, the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation (Saudi Arabia) and the British Council.
Activities.
Since 2006, Turquoise Mountain has:
It has three primary programmes: 
1. Education
In 2006 Turquoise Mountain established the Institute for Afghan Arts and Architecture. The Institute was recently approved by City & Guilds and is therefore Afghanistan’s only internationally accredited vocational education institution. The Institute’s master craftsmen are training a new generation of artisans, as an essential part of the revival of Afghanistan’s economy and cultural identity.
The Institute, with a staff and student body of almost 200 people, is composed of four Schools: 
2. Urban Regeneration
Murad Khane is a historic quarter of Kabul on the banks of the Kabul River, home to a multi-ethnic community and a thriving bazaar that attracts 10,000 visitors a week. Before Turquoise Mountain began working in the area, it was buried under two metres of rubbish, it had no running water, drainage or electricity, and the community’s homes were collapsing. In 2006, Turquoise Mountain was formally petitioned by the community of Murad Khane to preserve and restore the area. There is now a comprehensive regeneration programme, which is restoring historic buildings, installing infrastructure and working to provide basic healthcare, education and employment to the community.
Turquoise Mountain is implementing an integrated fully piped water treated sewage, electricity and water supply system which will provide running water for domestic and fire use, enclosed sewage removal and treatment and a reliable source of electricity in all of Murad Khane. In partnership with the Government of Afghanistan and the Kabul Urban Regeneration Project (KURP) this project will amount to the first system of its kind in the city and is intended to be a case study to be replicated in other areas of Kabul.
3. Business Development
The Business Development programme works to expand commercial opportunities for the Afghan crafts industry by linking high quality products to existing client demand abroad in its Design & Production Studio, which is equipped to produce large scale commissions, combining design and technical expertise in wood, ceramics, calligraphy and jewellery.
Examples of the commissions that Turquoise Mountain has completed include a suite, The Prince's Lodge, in the Connaught Hotel, London.

Free Voters

Free Voters ("Freie Wähler", FW or FWG) is a German concept in which an association of persons participates in an election without having the status of a registered political party. Usually it is a locally organized group of voters in the form of a registered association (eV). In most cases, Free Voters are active only at the local government level, standing for city councils and for mayor. Free Voters tend to be most successful in rural areas of Southern Germany, appealing the most to conservative voters who prefer local decisions to party politics. Free Voter groups are active in all German states.
Unlike in the other German states, the Free Voters of Bavaria have also contested state elections since 1998. In the 2008 Bavaria state election FW obtained 10.2% of the vote and gained their first 20 seats in the Landtag. Some think FW did so well partly because of the presence in the list of Gabriele Pauli, a former maverick member of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria.

The 97th Air Refueling Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the 92d Air Refueling Wing, stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. It was inactivated on 30 September 2004.
History.
World War II.
Established as a pre-World War II light bombardment squadron, equipped with B-18 Bolos; initially based in the Pacific Northwest, after the Pearl Harbor Attack was equipped with DB-7 Bostons and early-model B-24 Liberators (more likely LB-30s) taken by the AAF from export orders to perform antisubmarine patrols along the Washington and Oregon coast. In February 1942, with a Japanese submarine attack unlikely, the squadron was reassigned to III Bomber Command and re-equipped with A-20C Havoc light bombers and trained for overseas deployment.
In November 1942, deployed to French Morocco as part of the Operation Torch invasion force of French North Africa, being assigned to Twelfth Air Force. Arrived at a former Vichy French airfield; engaging in combat operations during the North African Campaign supporting Fifth Army forces driving east across Algeria and Tunisia. Remained as part of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) engaging enemy forces in the invasion of Sicily and Southern Italy during 1943. Participated in the Italian Campaign throughout the balance of the war, upgrading to Douglas A-26C Invaders in early 1945. The A-26Cs were used specifically for night raids against enemy strong points and troop concentrations. 
Returned to the United States in July 1945, being assigned to Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina. Planned for re-deployment to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) as part of the Operation Downfall invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. Deployment plans cancelled after the Japanese Capitulation in August, however remained active as part of the postwar Army Air Forces. Was inactivated in March 1946 due to personnel and budget shortages.
Air Refueling.
Reactivated in 1949 as the 97th Air Refueling Squadron and initially equipped with KB-29 Superfortress tankers in 1950. Upgraded to KC-97s in 1954 Assigned to Lake Charles AFB, Louisiana and provided air refueling to USAF aircraft, being deployed to England as well as operating in Newfoundland and Labrador as part of Northeast Air Command. Inactivated in 1964 as part of phaseout of KC-97 aircraft.
Reactivated in 1992 with KC-135 Stratotankers; inactivated in 2004.

"Times of Your Life" is a popular song and advertising jingle made famous in the 1970s by Canadian singer Paul Anka, who recorded it in 1975 for an album of the same title. It was written by Roger Nichols (melody) and Bill Lane (lyrics).
Kodak created an advertising campaign in 1975 that featured Anka singing a jingle entitled "Times of Your Life". While the tune was being heard across the United States in a commercial, Anka decided to record and release it as a single in late 1975. The song became a hit in the U.S., reaching number seven on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in February 1976 and remaining in the Top 40 for 12 weeks. The previous month, "Times of Your Life" had spent one week atop the "Billboard" easy listening (adult contemporary) chart, Anka's only recording to do so. 
Anka began including the song in his concert appearances, particularly during his shows in Las Vegas, Nevada. The performance of the song is often accompanied by a video montage featuring Anka and his family and friends.

After a car accident, sculptor Ken Harrison becomes a quadriplegic who sues for the right to end his life, no longer able to create art, make love or have any semblance of a normal existence. He hires a lawyer (Bob Balaban) who, reluctantly at first, represents Harrison while knowing that he is trying to win his client a death sentence.
Staunchly opposed to euthanasia is a by-the-book hospital administrator (John Cassavetes), who is determined to keep his patient alive even against his wishes, and sympathetic doctor (Christine Lahti), who develops personal feelings for Harrison. She wants to keep him alive, even though Harrison's girlfriend has accepted his decision.
A young orderly (Thomas Carter) and nurse (Kaki Hunter) do what they can to keep Harrison's spirits up, even wheeling him to a hospital basement where they treat him to reggae music and marijuana. In the end, though, it is up to a judge (Kenneth McMillan) whether the patient has a moral, ethical and legal right to choose to die.

Scholarship Examination

The Scholarship Examination (also known as the Grade 5 exam) is a highly competitive Sri Lankan examination conducted by the Department of Examinations of the Ministry of Education. It is optional for students to undertake it during the final year of primary school (Grade 5 (usually ages 9–10)). Based on the results of the exam, students could transfer to prominent national schools. The exams are held in three mediums: Sinhala, Tamil and English.
History.
The examinations were introduced by the late Hon. Dr. C.W.W. Kannangara, who took the initiative in establishing free education when he was the Minister of Education. Under this initiative the government established Madhya Maha Vidyalayas (MMV - Central Colleges) that were scattered around the island. The Scholarship Examination was a means for gifted students from villages to move to better schools with government scholarships.
School rankings.
Annually based on demand for individual schools, cut-off marks are set by the Ministry of Education. Schools ranking based on cut off marks for 2013;
Controversies.
In recent years the exam has become extremely competitive, therefore many claim that it puts unnecessary pressure on students at an early age. It has been considered as a "parent's" exam rather than student's. It is necessary to carry out a study on the long term success of the scholars.

Jean-Luc Sadourny

Jean-Luc Sadourny (born Toulouse, 26 August 1966) is a former French rugby union footballer and a current coach. He played as a fullback. He was nicknamed "The Old Woman" ("La Vieille") and he's generally considered one of the best French players of his generation, a fair successor to Serge Blanco in his position.
Sadourny played all his career at US Colomiers. His best result was the 2nd place in the France Top 14 in 2000.
He had 71 caps for France, from 1991 to 2001. He scored 14 tries and 4 drop goals, in an aggregate of 81 points, during his international career. The French fullback was selected for the 1991 Rugby World Cup finals, playing a single match, and for the 1995 Rugby World Cup finals, playing in all the five matches. He helped France to reach the 3rd place in this event. He won twice the Five Nations, with a grand slam, in 1997 and 1998. Sadourny is also remembered for scoring the famous "try from the end of the world" against the All Blacks in 1994. In the second and final Test of France's tour of New Zealand, France were trailing with about 3 minutes to play and were pinned deep in their own end by a tactical kick. They counter-attacked down the field, with the ball touched by nine different French players before Sadourny touched down to give "Les Bleus" the points that secured a 23-20 win and a 2–0 series win.
After retiring as a player, Sadourny entered the coaching ranks at Colomiers. He left to take over the reins at Blagnac for the 2007–08 season, leading them to an appearance in the Fédérale 1 final, where they lost to his former club Colomiers. As is standard practice in France, both finalists earned promotion to Rugby Pro D2 for the 2008–09 season. However, Sadourny chose not to stay with Blagnac, moving to Fédérale 3 club Stade Saint-Gaudinois for 2008–09, where he currently remains.
In 2010, Sadourny opened his own restaurant, the Sadourny Café, in Colomiers.

Phantom Theater

Phantom Theater was an Omnimover dark ride located at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. Originally opened in 1972 as a dark boat ride called "Enchanted Voyage", the ride was later converted to an Omnimover system in 1992 by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing and renamed Phantom Theater. 
Phantom Theater was replaced by Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Castle in 2003 and again by Boo Blasters on Boo Hill in 2010 utilizing the same ride system.
Enchanted Voyage (1972–1981).
A dark boat ride, akin to Disney's "It's a Small World", was themed in a building shaped like a giant TV set taking guests through several rooms featuring animatronics of new and old Hanna-Barbera characters. It cost about $2 million and was the most expensive ride at Kings Island when it opened. A very catchy theme song played throughout the ride that recited themes from familiar HB characters such as Fred Flintstone, Scooby Doo, and Yogi Bear. Less common shows such as Wacky Races and The Banana Splits were also included. The first room introduces the song, while the second room changes to a western accent. The third utilized a Caribbean flavor, while the fourth had a "spooky" theme. The fifth and final room reverted to the original music with a circus-like ambiance. The rides final exit was at the "mouth" of a giant clown as each boat would travel a few feet up an inclined lift before splashing down into the water on the other side.
Smurf's Enchanted Voyage (1982–1991).
Beginning in 1982, the theme of Enchanted Voyage was changed to The Smurfs. This included new animatronic characters, decorations, and song to coincide with the cartoon. The Smurfs Enchanted Voyage depicted the smurfs during various seasons of the year including holidays like Christmas and Halloween. The ride was usually open during Winterfest, an annual holiday event once held at the park from 1982 to 1992.
Phantom Theater (1992–2002).
At the end of the 1991 season, the building housing the attraction was gutted and the water transportation system was removed. Installed in its place was an Omnimover-type dark ride similar in style to The Haunted Mansion at various Disney parks across the globe. The original boat loading area was converted into the queue area for the "Scooby Zoom" ride. The entrance to the new ride was moved to the opposite corner of the building. A section of the building was converted into a children's theater called ""Enchanted Theater"". The theater was used for several years, but now only hosts the Halloween attraction, "CarnEVIL". 
Phantom Theater was themed to a behind-the-scenes tour of a theater haunted by the dead. The exterior of the building was stylized as a dilapidated and crumbling opera theater. The ride itself featured seventeen separate scenes which the Omnimover vehicles slowly traversed through. The ride notably featured a Pepper's ghost trick, a famous and widely used dark ride trick, for its stage production scene.
Kings Island displays a number of the Phantom Theater Omnimover vehicles that were removed in 2002 as Halloween displays during the park's Halloween Haunt. They are removed from storage each year and placed on the International Bandstand at the base of the Eiffel Tower. Sometimes the ride's original theme is played during Halloween Haunt.

Napier Cub

The Napier Cub was an unusual and very large experimental 16-cylinder 'X' pattern liquid-cooled aero engine built by the British engine company Napier & Son. The Cub was the only Napier 'X' engine design. First flown on 15 December 1922 in an Avro Aldershot biplane bomber aircraft, the only other application was in the Blackburn Cubaroo. Only six engines of this type were ordered and produced.
Design.
The four banks of four cylinders were arranged in a flattened 'X' when viewed from the front. The angle between the upper cylinders was 52.5 degrees, the lower cylinders 127.5 degrees which gave an angle of 90 degrees between the outer cylinder banks. The cylinders consisted of separate individual steel forgings with welded steel water cooling jackets. The carburettor was situated below the propeller reduction gear at the front of the engine and fed the inlet valves through four inlet manifolds. The valve drive gear, magnetos and pumps were fitted to the rear of the crankcase.

Hal King

Harold "Hal" King (born February 1, 1944 in Oviedo, Florida), is a retired Major League Baseball player who played catcher from -. He played for the Houston Astros, Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves, and Cincinnati Reds.
He attended Oviedo High School in Oviedo, Florida and was signed as an amateur free agent in 1965 by the California Angels. He made his major league debut, with the Houston Astros, at age 23 on September 6, 1967 with an eight-inning pinch-hit groundout against Baseball Hall of Famer Gaylord Perry. His first hit came four days later on September 10, 1967 with a single off the Dodgers' Bill Singer. Later in the game he notched both his first triple and first run batted in, also against Singer, driving in Rusty Staub.
His best year was with the 1970 Atlanta Braves. Appearing in 89 games, King had a .260 batting average with 11 home runs and 30 runs batted in.
On July 1, 1973, playing for the Cincinnati Reds, King hit one of the most famous home runs in Reds’ history. Entering the first game of a doubleheader at Riverfront Stadium, the Reds trailed their National League West rivals the Los Angeles Dodgers by a whopping 11 games. King, who just two weeks earlier had been called up from the minors, came to the plate as a pinch-hitter for fellow catcher Bill Plummer with the Dodgers and pitcher Don Sutton one out away from a win. With Tony Perez and Darrel Chaney (pinch-running for Johnny Bench) on base, King slugged a three-run homer for a 4-3 Reds' win. The Reds followed that up with a 3-2 win in the second game on a 10th-inning single by Perez that scored Joe Morgan, and the next night the Reds won yet another thriller over the Dodgers, 4-2, on a Perez walk-off homer.
Starting with the win on King's homer, the Reds went on to a 60–26 record the rest of the way to win the division championship.
The following year with the Reds, 1974, was his last in the majors, playing his final game on October 1, 1974.
He then had several successful years playing in the Mexican League from 1975 to 1979. As a designated hitter for the Saltillo Saraperos in 1979, he slugged 19 homers and led the league with 124 walks.
As of 1986-87 he was the president of the athletic boosters club of Oviedo High School and had a son in the school system.
He still lives in Oviedo, where he has a power washing and home maintenance business.

Izgoy

Izgoy (Изгой, Exile) - is a studio album by Alisa released in 2005 by Real Records. "Outcast" was the first album made by a new line up (with Igor Romanov (lead guitar) and Andrey Vdovichenko (drums)). A single "Blue Border" (Синий предел, Siniy Predel) preceded the album. The band released three video clips for the songs from the album: "Rock-n-Roll Cross" (Рок-н-ролл крест), "The Brutes" (Звери) and "Baptism" (Крещение).
Recording.
At the end of January 2005 Alisa began to record the album "Outcast". German audio engineers were invited: Jam (already took part in mixing of the previous album "It's later than you think") and Dave. Earlier both engineers worked with Guano Apes, Rammstein and U2.
At first Alisa made a demo record which was sent to Germany. Then Jam and Dave moved to Saint Petersburg and controlled the record process at studio "Dobrolet".
Musicians did their best; sometimes Konstantin Kinchev finished to record his parts at 6 a.m.
Eugeny Levin interpreted from Russian to English and vice versa, that is why he couldn't speak as usual after five days of recording. Igor Vdovichenko played very precisely what made the recording easier for Petr Samoylov. Igor Romanov was very scrupulous about his parts - he was ready to record them more and more times even when it wasn't necessary. Sometimes other members of the band had to stop him so that the album didn't consist only of his solos. Dmitry Parfenov recorded his parts at home and in studio he was only controlling the process of recording.
Album was mixed in Germany: at first at Topaz studio in Cologne and then at Skayline Tonfabrik in Düsseldorf. It was mixed in April. In July Alisa chose a label: it was Real Records. The album hit the shelves in October.
Single.
September 6, 2005 Real Records released single "Blue Border" (Синий предел).
The first song was "Outcast".
The second was "The Night" (cover for Piknik's song). It was written after Dmitry Parfenov (Alisa's keyboard player) got a proposal to make an album of covers for Piknik's songs. When recording of this album was going to be finished an idea to invite Konstantin Kinchev to record one song appeared. He accepted the offer and chose the song "The Night". It was included as a bonus track in the mentioned project of Piknik (this album was named Egyptian Nights) and in Alisa's single.
The third song of the single is "Blue Border". Alexei Rybnikov made an offer of a joint record for Konstantin Kinchev. Alisa's leader could choose any Rybnikov's music and he pitched upon soundtrack for movie Treasure Island. Konstantin Kinchev added his variant of couplet and refrain and composed the text.
The single also included videobonus: performance of the song Antichrist on concert "We Are Together 20 Years".
Songs.
The song which was composed earlier than all others is "Fear, Ask and Believe". It was composed in Cologne during mixing of the album "It's later than you think".
Konstantin Kinchev appreciated "Son Jerusalem" as the main song of the album and told that all other compositions are "built" around it.
Konstantin Kinchev speaking about the song "Outcast":
If speaking about the song it is about Christ. If speaking generally it's about people who make their lifes by going again the stream. Because only dead fish goes adrift.
Answering the questions: do you sympathize outcasts? What attracts you in them? Konstantin answered:
Outcast is a conscious choice of a man. It is already a position. A person who is ready to refuse benefits for his own position can't cause anything except for respect even if his beliefs are not concordant with our view of the world.
The shootings of videoclip for "Rock-n-roll Cross" took place in half-constructed Winter Palace in Kiev. A special stage was made; a lot of pyrotechnics was used. Two days before the start of the shootings the band began to choose people for roles of spectators in the videocip. 300 members from Alisa's fan club were chosen.
Konstantin Kinchev about the album.
Comparing "Outcast" with previous "It's later than you think" Konstantin Kinchev named it to be more rough. He also added that in the previous album he "shared his thoughts about the destiny of Motherland" and in "Outcast" we can hear feelings about his inner struggle.
After release of the album Konstantin Kinchev was pleased with its sound quality:
We have made an effort to combine incompatible things in this album - I think that this is what the art is. In principle rock is a synthesis of arts. Did we manage to do it - it's a question for audience. But I'm pleased with this work. On the other hand the genre of nu metal is narrow-minded so we can't avoid comparisons with other bands. If desired you can hear there Clawfinger, Rammstein. Clawfinger is even more: "My war" resembles Live Like A Man. I won't say that it's quite the same but just listening to Clawfinger pushed me to use such a riff. But unlike the Swedes we leave some place for melodious songs. There are two of them in "Outcast". Besides every word in our album is audible.

<doc id="19509772" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19509772" title="Martinus Thomsen">
Martinus Thomsen

Martinus Thomsen, referred to as Martinus, () (August 11, 1890 – March 8, 1981) was a Danish author, philosopher and mystic. Born into a poor family and with a limited education, Martinus claimed to have had a profound spiritual experience in March 1921. This experience which he called "cosmic consciousness", would be the inspiration for the books he wrote later on and are collectively entitled The Third Testament. Some of his works have been translated into twenty languages and while he is not well known internationally, his work remains popular in Scandinavia.
Early life.
Born on 11 August 1890 near Sindal, a small town in northern Jutland, Denmark, Thomsen grew up in a house called "Moskildvad". This house, now open to the public, is testimony to the poverty he experienced during childhood. An illegitimate child, Thomsen never knew his father. His mother never married and worked on a farm called Kristiansminde. There, a stableman by the name of Thomsen was named his father and therefore he was named Martinus Thomsen. He did state that he suspected the proprietor of the farm to be his real father.
His mother was unable to care for him as a young child and as a result, he was taken in by her brother and his wife. They were an elderly couple who had already raised eleven children of their own but despite this, Thomsen always referred to them fondly. He mentioned that despite their meager circumstances, they always made him feel secure. His mother died when he was just eleven and for the most part, his contact with her was very limited.
His education at the local village school was very basic, focusing mainly on verses of hymns, geography, Danish and natural history, arithmetic and the catechism. He spent six hours per week in class in the summer and thirty hours per week in the winter. His foster family could not afford books and Thomsen has stated he inherited old copies of "Familie Journalen" ("The Family Journal"), which became the basis of his reading material.
Enlightenment at the age of 30.
According to Martinus, during March 1921 a decisive transformation took place in his life, in that he had strong spiritual experiences that led to a profound expansion of his consciousness. His books On the Birth of My Mission and Intellectualized Christianity provide a description of these, for him.
Martinus called this new state of consciousness, which he attained at the age of 30, "cosmic consciousness". The prerequisite for cosmic consciousness is a highly developed faculty of intuition, which all human beings will develop sooner or later.
Ideas and works.
Martinus' works are collectively entitled "The Third Testament". His 7-volume main work is Livets Bog (The Book of Life). The Eternal World Picture, vols. 1–5, in which he explains the main principles in his world picture with the aid of coloured symbols and explanatory texts, supplement his main work. His other books include Logic, Bisættelse (On Funerals), Intellectualised Christianity and 28 shorter works; he has also written a substantial number of articles.
At present 19 of Martinus’ books have been translated into English and some of Martinus’ books have been translated into 20 other languages. See an overview of his complete works below.
Symbols.
Martinus drew and painted a large number of symbols, figures, colours and lines, each illustrating specific areas of the cosmic analyses which he claimed are important elements in his overall description of the eternal world picture. In his opinion these symbols provide an accessible overview of the principles and laws that characterize life and the universe as a whole.
Forty-four symbols with associated symbol explanations are published in his books "The Eternal World Picture 1–5"; a supplement to his main work, "Livets Bog" ("The Book of Life"). Martinus left a number of additional symbols, which the Martinus Institute expects to publish in later volumes of The Eternal World Picture.
Death.
Martinus lived in a small apartment on the first floor of the Martinus Institute until he died on 8 March 1981 at the age of 90.
Bibliography.
Martinus published many books and pamphlets, many of which have been translated.

John Sadler (1820–1910)

John Sadler (1 February 1820 – 22 December 1910) was an industrialist and public figure associated with the town of Oldbury, Worcestershire (now Oldbury, West Midlands), United Kingdom. As a result of his lifetime of service, Sadler became known as 'the Grand Old Man of Oldbury'.
Background.
John was the youngest son of Benjamin Sadler (1777–1850) and Nancy Johnson (1776–1852) of Round's Green, Oldbury. Members of the Sadler family contributed greatly to their native district during the nineteenth century and rose to pre-eminence in the area. Further afield, John's nephew, Sir Samuel Alexander Sadler (1842–1911), achieved renown in the town of Middlesbrough in the North East of England.
Career.
Sadler was educated at Himley and West Bromwich, before entering into an apprenticeship under his elder brother Samuel Sadler (1807–1861) as a builder. Having reached the age of twenty-one, he took over the Brick Manufacturing business established by his father, a pioneer of the industry in Oldbury, and came to found his own firm - eventually registered as John Sadler & Sons of Shidas Lane, Oldbury ("manufacturer of every description of Staffordshire brindled, red, blue and brown bricks and tiles"), established in 1847/1849 and converted into a Private Limited Company in 1900. The site owned by Sadler and used for his enterprise was that portion of land bounded by Shidas Lane, Portway Road and Rounds Green Road, amounting to roughly seven acres, immediately outside Oldbury. It is currently under re-development. The marl hole on the site used for the extraction of clay eventually grew to such a size as to swallow Sadler's former place of residence.
Public service.
In addition to his labours as an industrialist, Sadler consistently showed the greatest interest in the affairs of his home town. He served on the Urban District Council, the Board of Health, the Burial Board and the West Bromwich Board of Guardians, as a representative of Oldbury, from 1889 until his death.
Sadler was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party and held Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in the highest regard. As such, Sadler's final residence on Portway Road, Oldbury was named 'Gladstone House'.
Sadler was a non-conformist associated with the Methodist and Tabernacle churches. He contributed to the cost of erecting the new Methodist Chapel at Round's Green and a stained glass window dedicated to his posterity was installed there following his death.
Marriages and issue.
John Sadler married firstly Harriot Sturges (June 1820 – 27 June 1887), daughter of Theophilus Sturges and Ann Page of Brades, Rowley Regis on 23 April 1839 in The Parish Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Aston, by whom he had issue. He married secondly Phoebe Bridge, widow of Joseph Bridge, previously widow of Thomas Sadler Sturges, initially daughter of Joseph Grayer on 24 February 1891.
Burial.
Sadler was buried in the family vault at the Parish Church of Christ Church, Oldbury. There sat an elaborate memorial to various members of the family in the churchyard, now dismantled but remaining in situ.

VRC-40

Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 40 (VRC-40), also known as the "Rawhides", is a United States Navy fleet logistics support squadron based at Naval Air Station Norfolk. Commissioned in 1960, it is only one of two active fleet logistics squadrons in the Navy.
History.
Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 40 (VRC-40) was commissioned on 1 July 1960 and is tasked with providing Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) services to the U.S. Navy's Second, Fifth, and Sixth Fleets. VRC-40, homeported at Naval Station, Norfolk, Virginia (USA), operates the Grumman C-2A Greyhound and reports to Commander, Airborne Early Warning Wing, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
Maintaining and flying the squadron's 14 aircraft are nearly 320 enlisted personnel and 42 officers. Unlike most squadrons, VRC-40 does not deploy as a unit. Instead, it prepares five separate sea going detachments with a two-plane complement while maintaining a shore "Homeguard" to support local operational commitments. Based at remote forward logistics sites, the deployed detachments support multiple Carrier Strike Groups that operate in the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Fleets aboard deployed aircraft carriers providing continuous fleet support. VRC-40 supports the fleet from ships and bases as far north as Norway, down the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast, throughout the Caribbean, in Central and South America, and all over the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern theaters. Recently, VRC-40 played a vital role in support of combat missions during Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom and was selected as the Commander Naval Air Force Battle "E" winner for the 2010 calendar year.
After flying the Grumman C-1A Trader aircraft for over 26 years, VRC-40 completed a transition to the C-2A in 1986, marking the end of the reciprocating engine era in Naval Aviation history. VRC-40's continuing mission is the efficient transportation of passengers, mail, and cargo to and from carriers at sea.
While speed and efficiency are requisite to completion of the squadron's mission, safety is of paramount importance. Among VRC-40's many achievements and accomplishments, the "Rawhides" recently reached one of the highest honors in Aviation Safety by successfully completing 25 years of class "A" mishap free flying.
Every year, VRC-40 carries over three million pounds of mail and cargo and effects over 1,000 arrested landings. Astronauts Alan Shepard and Scott Carpenter, sports icons including Tiger Woods, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., numerous Congressional and Cabinet members, business leaders, and entertainers such as Bruce Willis, Charlie Daniels, Jimmy Buffett, Halle Berry and Robin Williams have all flown with the "Rawhides".

Ghosts in Bengali culture

Ghosts are an important part of folklore in Bengal. Fairy tales, both old and new often use the concept of ghosts. In modern day Bengali literature as well, references to ghosts may be often found. It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth. The common word for ghosts in Bengali is "bhoot" or "bhut" (Bengali: ভূত). This word has an alternative meaning: 'Past' in Bengali. Also the word "Pret" (Sanskrit) is used in Bengali to mean ghost.
In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the spirit after death of an unsatisfied human being or a soul of a person who dies in unnatural or abnormal circumstances (like murder, suicide or accident). Even it is believed that other animals and creatures can also be turned into ghost after their death.
Usually after the death there are some Hindu rituals that are used to follow in Bengal which ends with a holy food offerings (called ‘Pindodaan’) to the spirit of the dead person. This final ritual is done at "Pret Pahar" (Mountain of Spirits) in Gaya, Bihar. It is believed that if this final ritual remains incomplete the spirit cannot leave this mortal world for heaven and haunts their relatives to complete it.
Types of ghosts.
There are many kinds of ghost believed in Bengali culture. Few are referred here:
Cultural references.
In folklore, ghosts are often found in desolate stretches of road or fields around villages, at crematoriums and graveyards, on Ashhyath, Sheora or other similar trees and also in deserted and haunted houses. A curious aspect of female ghosts, petnis, is that their feet are said to be backwards. Ghosts in folk tales are almost always malicious.
Ghosts in Bengali literature.
Ghost is one of the most popular genres in Bengali literature. In early days ghosts were only the ingredients of Bengali folk tales and fairy tales. "Thakurmar Jhuli" was one of the most famous collections of Bengali folk tales and fairy tales compiled by "Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder" in 1907. There we can find almost all the above categories of ghost in different stories. Some other comparable books for children in Bengali Literature by the same author are "Thakur Dadar Jhuli" (Grandpa's Sack of Folktales), "Dadamoshayer Tholay" (Maternal-Grandpa's Sack of Folktales) and "Thandidir Tholay" (Maternal-Grandpa's Sack of Folktales).
There are many great writers who have practiced the genre of Ghost Stories. A few of them are Parashuram (Rajshekhar Basu), Sharadindu Bandopadhyay (Baroda Series), Syed Mustafa Siraz (MurariBabu Series), Satyajit Ray, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, Gouri De and many more. In past and present many other prominent Bengali writers have tried this genre successfully in their stories and Bengal has a rich collection of ghost stories. Few examples are noted below:
Ghosts in Bengali cinema.
As like Bengali literature, in Bengali cinema also ghosts are a popular item. Films likes "Hanabari" (Haunted House), "Kuheli", "Monihara" (part of the movie 'Teen Kanya') were quite popular in the era of Bengali black and white movies.
Beside the horror movies the ghosts have appeared in Bengali films in a lightly comical mood, sometimes acting in a friendly way. One of the great examples is "Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne" as mentioned earlier is adopted from the story of Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury and directed by Satyajit Ray. In this film we can see the king of ghost (a Bramhadaitya) gives three boons to 'Goopy' and 'Bagha', the two poor village boys who aspired to become a singer and drummer respectively. And with the help of those boons they did many adventures. Later Satyajit Ray wrote two more stories as the sequels of the first one and made films (last one was directed by Sandip Ray, son of Satyajit Ray).
In recent times, ghost-centred Bengali films are being made. Probably the most well-known ghost film of recent times is 'Bhooter Bhabishyat' (literally translated to 'The Future of the Ghosts'), directed by Anik Dutta. It tells the story of a haunted mansion 'Choudhury Palace', where ghosts from different ethnic backgrounds and eras reside (a Bengali zamindar of 18th century, an actress of 1930s, a modern rockstar, a soldier of Indian Army who died in Kargil, etc.). The film with its simple but humorous story went on to become a massive blockbuster of 2012.

Gordon Herbert Vasse

Air Commodore Gordon Herbert Vasse CBE RAF, (23 April 1899 – 26 March 1965), was a fighter pilot in the First World War and a senior Royal Air Force commander during the Second World War and into the late 1940s and early 1950s. During most of the Second World War he was Director of Air Tactics for the RAF.
In his final appointment Vasse also served as the seventh Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps. Vasse was chosen as one of the RAF’s principal representatives to the funeral of King George VI in 1952.
Service history.
Early career.
In 1917 Vasse joined the Royal Naval Air Service as a trainee pilot in the rank of Probationery Flight Officer and was later promoted to Flight Sub-Lieutenant.
When the RAF was formed in March 1918 Vasse transferred to the new service in the rank of 2nd Lieutenant (Pilot) and was rapidly promoted to Pilot Officer and then Flying Officer. After seeing active combat duty as a fighter pilot in the latter stages of the First World War Vasse was transferred to the unemployed officer list in September 1919.
Back to the RAF.
In October 1921 he rejoined the RAF on a short service commission in the rank of Flying Officer and posted as a supernumerary pilot at the RAF Central Depot. After a further supernumerary posting to the School of Technical Training he was posted to No. 6 Squadron RAF as a pilot in April 1923. 
After a short one month period as a supernumerary at the Central Depot over the Christmas of 1925 he was granted a permanent commission in January 1926 and posted as an instructor to the RAF’s Air Armament and Gunnery School. Promoted to Flight Lieutenant in July 1927, in March 1929 he was appointed Armaments Officer at the RAF North Coates gunnery practice range in Lincolnshire where he remained until November 1930.
Returning to flying duties as a flight commander with No. XV Squadron RAF on 1 November 1930 he remained with the squadron until February 1933, apart from a two-month period while suffering from an illness that prevented him from flying. In November he was posted overseas firstly as Armaments Officer for No. 3 (Indian) Wing RAF and later as Staff Armament Officer at Headquarters No. 1 (Indian) Group.
Returning to the UK in 1936 he was appointed as a Staff Instructor at the Air Armament School on promotion to Squadron Leader. After a short armament officer posting to RAF Northolt he was promoted to Wing Commander and granted his first command as Officer Commanding the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU) at RAF Duxford.
Commands.
He would remain at Duxford, becoming Station Commander there, on promotion to Group Captain, until July 1941 when he was appointed Deputy Director of the RAF Air Tactics department. In October the following year he became Director of the department in the rank of Acting Air Commodore. In July 1945 he was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by King George VI in the King's Birthday Honours.
Between 1944 and 1945 Vasse filled a number of senior appointments in quick succession including Deputy Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at Headquarters Air Command South East Asia, SASO No. 221 Group RAF and SASO HQ RAF Burma. As the war ended Vasse was serving as AOC RAF Seletar in Singapore.
Returning to post war England in the Autumn of 1946 Vasse served in a number of AOC appointments with No. 21 Group RAF, No. 25 Group and latterly No. 63 Group where he remained from March 1948 until March 1951. His rank as an Air Commodore was confirmed on 1 July 1947.
Royal Observer Corps.
In March 1951 Vasse was posted to RAF Bentley Priory and took over as the seventh Commandant Royal Observer Corps from Air Commodore Sir Richard Bowen Jordan KCB DFC ADC RAF. Vasse was able to bring his long expertise in air tactics to bear on the operational systems used by the ROC in tracking aircraft. He also oversaw the expansion of the Corps’ coverage to include Northern Ireland for the first time, establishing No. 31 Group ROC with its headquarters in Lisburn.
Vasse was selected by the RAF to be one of its principal representatives at the funeral of King George VI at Westminster Abbey and Windsor Castle. His first task after the funeral was to formally invite Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth to become the Corps’ new Air Commodore in Chief, an appointment she readily accepted.
Air Commodore Vasse’s attention was then directed at the growing problem of the Corps tracking the newly introduced high speed jet aircraft. He realised it would need a revised operational layout to maintain reporting efficiency. The solution addressed a consolidation of group boundaries to match RAF Fighter Command sectors and crucial improvements in track handover across group boundaries.
The reorganisation of groups reduced their number and Vasse oversaw the closing of the wartime operational centres at Maidstone, Lincoln, Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Gloucester, Cardiff, Wrexham and Dunfermline, several of which would reopen three years later. The dual centres at York were combined into a single establishment. Posts were rearranged so that some clusters now straddled group boundaries and reported to both centres to improve fast jet track handovers between groups.
Retirement.
The Royal Observer Corps was Vasse’s final service appointment and he retired from the RAF on 26 April 1954 and handed over command of the ROC to Air Commodore J H T Simpson DSO AFC. Vasse was due to return to RAF Bentley Priory as a principal guest of honour at the Royal Review of the Royal Observer Corps by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in July 1966, but sadly he died before the event.

Earth in culture

The cultural perspective on the Earth, or world, varies by society and time period. Religious beliefs often include a creation belief as well as personification in the form of a deity. The exploration of the world has modified many of the perceptions of the planet, resulting in a viewpoint of a globally integrated ecosystem. Unlike the remainder of the planets in the Solar System, mankind didn't perceive the Earth as a planet until the sixteenth century.
Etymology.
Unlike the other planets in the Solar System, in English, Earth does not directly share a name with an ancient Roman deity. The name "Earth" derives from the eighth century Anglo-Saxon word "erda", which means ground or soil. It became "eorthe" later, and then "erthe" in Middle English. These words are all cognates of Jörð, the name of the giantess of Norse myth. Earth was first used as the name of the sphere of the Earth in the early fifteenth century. The planet's name in Latin, used academically and scientifically in the West during the Renaissance, is the same as that of Terra Mater, the Roman goddess, which translates to English as Mother Earth.
Planetary symbol.
The standard astronomical symbol of the Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle. This symbol is known as the wheel cross, sun cross, Odin's cross or Woden's cross. Although it has been used in various cultures for different purposes, it came to represent the compass points, earth and the land. Another version of the symbol is a cross on top of a circle; a stylized globus cruciger that was also used as an early astronomical symbol for the planet Earth.
Religious beliefs.
Earth has often been personified as a deity, in particular a goddess. In many cultures the mother goddess is also portrayed as a fertility deity. To the Aztec, Earth was called Tonantzin—"our mother"; to the Incas, Earth was called Pachamama—"mother earth". The Chinese Earth goddess Hou Tu is similar to Gaia, the Greek goddess personifying the Earth. To Hindus it is called Bhuma Devi, the Goddess of Earth. (See also Graha.) In Norse mythology, the Earth giantess Jörð was the mother of Thor and the daughter of Annar. Ancient Egyptian mythology is different from that of other cultures because Earth is male, Geb, and sky is female, Nut.
Creation myths in many religions recall a story involving the creation of the world by a supernatural deity or deities. A variety of religious groups, often associated with fundamentalist branches of Protestantism or Islam, assert that their interpretations of the accounts of creation in sacred texts are literal truth and should be considered alongside or replace conventional scientific accounts of the formation of the Earth and the origin and development of life. Such assertions are opposed by the scientific community as well as other religious groups. A prominent example is the creation-evolution controversy.
Physical form.
In the ancient past there were varying levels of belief in a flat Earth, with the Mesopotamian culture portraying the world as a flat disk afloat in an ocean. The spherical form of the Earth was suggested by early Greek philosophers; a belief espoused by Pythagoras. By the Middle Ages—as evidenced by thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas—European belief in a spherical Earth was widespread.
Modern perspective.
The technological developments of the latter half of the 20th century are widely considered to have altered the public's perception of the Earth. Before space flight, the popular image of Earth was of a green world. Science fiction artist Frank R. Paul provided perhaps the first image of a cloudless "blue" planet (with sharply defined land masses) on the back cover of the July 1940 issue of "Amazing Stories", a common depiction for several decades thereafter.
Earth was first photographed from space by Explorer 6 in 1959. Yuri Gagarin became the first human to view Earth from space in 1961. The crew of the Apollo 8 was the first to view an Earth-rise from lunar orbit in 1968. In 1972 the crew of the Apollo 17 produced the famous "Blue Marble" photograph of the planet Earth from cislunar space. This became an iconic image of the planet as a marble of cloud-swirled blue ocean broken by green-brown continents. NASA archivist Mike Gentry has speculated that "The Blue Marble" is the most widely distributed image in human history. A photo taken of a distant Earth by "Voyager 1" in 1990 inspired Carl Sagan to describe the planet as a "Pale Blue Dot."
Since the 1960s, Earth has also been described as a massive "Spaceship Earth," with a life support system that requires maintenance, or, in the Gaia hypothesis, as having a biosphere that forms one large organism.
Over the past two centuries a growing environmental movement has emerged that is concerned about humankind's effects on the Earth. The key issues of this socio-political movement are the conservation of natural resources, elimination of pollution, and the usage of land. Although diverse in interests and goals, environmentalists as a group tend to advocate sustainable management of resources and stewardship of the environment through changes in public policy and individual behavior. Of particular concern is the large-scale exploitation of non-renewable resources. Changes sought by the environmental movements are sometimes in conflict with commercial interests due to the additional costs associated with managing the environmental impact of those interests.

2005–06 Lebanese Second Division

The 2005–06 Lebanese Second Division was the 72nd season of the Second Division league which featured 12 Clubs. 3 of these teams were eligible for promotion to the top league of Lebanese football, the Lebanese Premier League while 1 of the 12 teams had to face relegation to the Lebanese Third Division for the 2006-07 Season.
From the 2004-05 Premier League, 3 teams were relegated to the Second Division. However, 2 teams were brought up to the Premier League from the 2004-05 Second Division, these 2 teams being Salam Zgharta and Racing Beirut. This was due to the Lebanese Football Federation announcing it will reduce the number of teams in the Premier League from 11 to 10 for the 2005-06 Season leading to an increase in the number of teams in the Second Division.
At the end of the season, Shabab Al-Sahel earned the title after finishing on 56 Points, 5 clear of the nearest club, Al-Hikma who finished 2nd on 51 Points with 16 victories, 3 draws and just 3 losses for the Season. The last team in this season to earn promotio was the
Al-Ahli Sidon team who finished 3rd and just 1 point behind Al-Hikma.

Music of The X-Files

Music of "The X-Files" franchise is composed and written by American Mark Snow, the franchise was created by Chris Carter. Snow has composed the music for all the franchise main releases (etc. television shows and films). Together with the show, the music was positively met by critics and viewers of the show alike. Snow has been nominated with over twenty awards and nominations for his music on the various franchise releases, but notably "The X-Files". Among the most famous compositions of the franchise is the theme song for "The X-Files". The theme reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart. 
With "The X-Files" peaking in popularity in the mid-to-late 1990s, the music did too. When the show was hitting its peak in popularity, Carter created a spin off to the series, entitled "Millennium" which aired from 1996-1999. While never gaining as much attention as "The X-Files", the show's theme song and soundtrack releases were well received by critics. "The Lone Gunmen" is the last television spin off of "The X-Files" which only aired for around two months. A soundtrack of the original music has been released in a set with music from Carter's other short lived Science Fiction series Harsh Realm. Snow returned to compose music for the franchise with the film, "".
"The X-Files".
Early conception and series (1993–2002).
Mark Snow got involved with "The X-Files", since he was a good friend of executive producer R.W. Goodwin. When the production staff was talking about who was going to take the composing duties for the series, Chris Carter didn't know who to ask, in total about "10-15" people were looked at. But Goodwin pressed for Snow being the show's composer. Snow auditioned around three times, but didn't get any signs from the production staff if they wanted him. One day, Snow's agent called talking about the pilot episode, and hinted that he had got the part. At first Snow wasn't sure if he wanted to work on "The X-Files", giving the reason that he felt they were "weird". So Snow eventually started to compose his music in Los Angeles, California, in which he would continue until the show's end.
At the start, Carter and the producers wanted Snow to heavily use synthesizers when composing his music, to sustain a "type A atmosphere ambient sound design". Snow had commented that after a while he got tired with this, and wanted to make a new musical direction for the show. He then started to do more "musical" work, such as creating more "melodies" for his songs. When composing the music for the show, the monster-of-the-week episodes, Snow got a lot more "freedom" when compared to the mytharc episodes which were much more "traditional" and conservative in its approach. Carter and the production crew gave Snow much freedom to compose his own music, rarely if ever giving him any notes on how he would record or compose his music for the series; when he was given notes they would be in a more basic form such as "too much" or "too loud", according to Snow.
When creating the music for "The X-Files: Fight the Future", Snow had a couple of months to write and to produce the music while he also created the music for the television show. The first film marked the first time the music for the franchise was composed and recorded with help from an orchestra. According to Snow, the recording and writing process didn't change during the making of the film. The biggest difference was that he used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would go to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.
The sixth season episode "The Unnatural" marked the first time in the series that the show recorded the score with musicians rather than synthesizers. Slide guitar player Nick Kirgo and harmonica player Tommy Morgan assisted Snow with the score.
For the seventh season episode "Closure", Mark Snow's music was not used, being replaced by Moby's "My Weakness". Carter never told Snow about this change. While Snow has been confirmed to be more positive to it than negative, saying it fit "perfect", and further stating, "Every once in a while, when Chris would pick out a pop song or whatever, he would always make really great choices and I thought that was a good one."
"Within", the season eight premiere, was the first of six episodes to feature the song "Scully's Theme". The other five were "Without", "Per Manum", "This Is Not Happening", "Deadalive" and the season finale "Existence". The song features a solo female voice that repeats the distorted words "We are near" over and over. According to Carter, it is one of the greatest things that series composer Snow has ever done. Carter himself admitted to "tweaking" the song a little, adding the three words that are repeated over and over, with the idea to "distort" them.
"I Want to Believe" (2008).
After "The X-Files" was cancelled in 2002, Chris Carter and his crew started working with a goal of releasing a second "X-Files" film. In 2003, Carter called Snow, who by that time lived in London, UK and said he wanted him to return for another film. Snow was positive to the idea, but filming got bogged down by contract issues between Fox and Carter. Once the contract issues were sorted out, Carter re-contacted Snow about the development and later on sent him the script for the film. Carter and his production crew wanted as much secrecy for the film as possible, forcing Snow to sign a contract when receiving the script. Snow wrote a couple of demos at the start, in which Carter and Frank Spotnitz were not to pleased about, but it eventually worked out when Snow re-recorded them.
When composing the music for "", Snow said it was "different" from the previous film which followed the show's mytharc storyline about the government conspiracy with aliens. He said it was much "more heart, warmth and tuneful music" since this film was much more based around Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) relationship.
Snow recorded the score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City, California. No music was written out during Snow's recording season with the symphony orchestra. When making the music, Snow used many instruments such as a "battery of percussion", taiko drums and whistle with live singers, among other things. It took four days to record and writing music for and with the orchestra. He used no trumpets and no high woodwinds when recording, but used up to eight french horns, five trombones, two piano, one harp, thirty-two violins, sixteen violas twelve cellos and eight basses.
British performers UNKLE recorded a new version of the theme music for the end credits to the movie. Some of the unusual sounds were created by a variation of silly putty and dimes tucked in between and over the strings of the piano. Mark Snow also comments that the fast percussion featured in some tracks was inspired by the track 'Prospectors Quartet' from the "There Will Be Blood" soundtrack. UNKLE's song "Broken" was also included in the end credits.
"Millennium".
The theme music for "Millennium" was created by Mark Snow. A popular belief amongst fans is that the theme song was inspired by Kylie Minogue's dance pop song "Confide In Me". In reality, Chris Carter allegedly sent him a traditional Scottish céilidh song.
Reception and legacy.
"The X-Files" theme music went straight to #2 on March 30, 1996, on the UK Singles Chart and stayed there for three weeks, then kept on dropping. In France, the single entered the chart at #42 on April 6, 1996, climbed quickly until reaching #2 four weeks later. It remained blocked for five weeks at this position, behind Robert Miles's hit "Children", then topped the chart for a sole week, becoming the second instrumental number-one hit, before climbing. It totalled 1 weeks in the top ten and 30 weeks in the top 50. The single was re-charted from October 1998, but remained in low positions. It is the 754th best-selling single of all time in France.

Editio Regia

Editio Regia ("Royal edition"), it is the third and the most important edition of the Greek New Testament of Robert Estienne (1503-1559). It is one of the most important printed editions of the Greek New Testament in history, the Textus Receptus. It was named "Editio Regia" because of the beautiful and elegant Greek font it uses.
It was edited by Estienne in 1550 at Paris. It is the first Greek Testament that has a critical apparatus. Estienne entered on the margins of the pages variant readings from 15 Greek manuscripts as well as many readings from the Complutensian Polyglot. He designated all these sources by symbols from α' to ιϛ'. The "Complutensian Polyglot" was signified by α'. The critical collation was the new subject, and although Estienne omitted hundreds important variants from used witnesses, it was the first step towards modern Textual Criticism. 
The oldest manuscript used in this edition was the Codex Bezae, which had been collated for him, "by friends in Italy" (secundo exemplar vetustissimum in Italia ab amicis collatum). The majority of these manuscripts are held in National Library of France to the present day. Estienne made only a few changes in Erasmian text. He added to the Erasmian text verse Luke 17:36. He took it from Codex Bezae. 
The text of the editions of 1546 and 1549 was a composition of the Complutesian and Erasmian Novum Testamentum. The third edition approaches more closely to the Erasmian fourth and fifth editions. According to John Mill first and second editions differ in 67 places, and the third in 284 places. The third edition became for many scholars, especially in England, the normative text of the Greek New Testament. It maintained this position until 1880. The fourth edition used exactly the same text as the third, without a critical apparatus, but the text is divided into numbered verses for the first time in the history of the printed text of Greek New Testament. It was used for the Geneva Bible.
Manuscripts and sources used in "Editio Regia".
In Preface Estienne declared to use sixteen manuscripts.
Manuscripts γ', δ', ε', ϛ', ζ', η', ι', ιε' were taken from the King Henry II's Library (Royal Library of France, now Bibliothèque nationale de France). It was suggested by Wettstein that θ' means Codex Coislinianus (it came to France ca. 1650, and was not available in time of Estienne).

Liebeslieder Walzer (ballet)

Liebeslieder Walzer is a ballet by New York City Ballet co-founder and balletmaster George Balanchine based on the Brahms' "Liebeslieder Walzer", op. 52, and their sequel "Neue Liebeslieder", op. 65.
The premier of the ballet took place on Tuesday, 22 November, 1960, New York, at the City Center of Music and Drama, New York, with "mise en scène" by David Hays and costumes by Karinska. The duo pianists were Louise Sherman and Robert Irving and the singers Angeline Rasmussen, Mitzi Wilson, Frank Poretta and Herbert Beattie.
Scenario.
The musicians and dancers appear on stage together in period costumes. The dancers wear formal evening dress and the women dancing slippers during the first set of eighteen waltzes in a cozy ballroom; after a brief lowering of the curtain they dance the next fourteen waltzes under a starry sky, the women in calf-length tulle skirts and pointe shoes. They leave the stage two by two and return in pairs in original costume to listen to the last waltz.

Ali Mohamed Daoud

Ali Mohamed Daoud, also known as Jean-Marie (born 28 August 1950), is a Djiboutian politician and the President of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD). He is currently a member of the National Assembly of Djibouti.
Daoud is a member of the Afar ethnic group. FRUD, fighting on behalf of Afar interests, began a rebellion against the Issa-dominated government in 1991. Daoud led the moderate faction of FRUD in signing a peace agreement with the government in December 1994. As a result of the agreement, he joined the government (together with one other FRUD member, Secretary-General Ougouré Kiflé Ahmed) as Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs on 8 June 1995. Daoud's faction of FRUD also allied with the governing People's Rally for Progress (RPP). On 15–16 April 1997, FRUD held its First Congress; Daoud, who was already FRUD President, remained in that position at the congress. Daoud was elected to the National Assembly in the December 1997 parliamentary election as the first candidate on the joint candidate list of the RPP and FRUD for Tadjourah Region.
Daoud was moved from his post as Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs to that of Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and the Sea on 12 May 1999; he was also assigned responsibility for hydraulic resources. After holding that post for two years, he was omitted from the government that was appointed on 4 July 2001. FRUD held its Second Ordinary Congress on 28–29 April 2002, and Daoud was re-elected as FRUD President.
Daoud was re-elected in the January 2003 parliamentary election as the first candidate on the candidate list of the ruling coalition, the Union for a Presidential Majority (UMP), in Tadjourah Region. In this election, the other, more radical wing of FRUD, led by Ahmed Dini Ahmed, participated in the election as part of the opposition; Daoud criticized Ahmed as a "perpetual loser".
President Ismail Omar Guelleh awarded the medal of the Commander of the Great Star of Djibouti to Daoud and Ougouré Kiflé Ahmed during independence day celebrations on 27 June 2004. At FRUD's Third Congress, held on 30–31 May 2007, Daoud was re-elected as President of FRUD by acclamation, without opposition. He was again re-elected to the National Assembly in the February 2008 parliamentary election as the second candidate on the UMP's candidate list for the city of Djibouti.

Papilio appalachiensis

Papilio appalachiensis, the Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail, is a species of swallowtail butterfly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. It is a hybrid of another two "Papilio" species, "Papilio canadensis" and "Papilio glaucus", with whom it shares many characteristics. The butterflies are normally yellow and contain black patters in their wings. Their winspan ranges from 86 to 115 mm. The caterpillars range in color from green and yellow to orange and are ornamented with black specks that give them the appearance of a bird dropping, which is useful for camouflage, or a large eye, a form of mimicry that is also efficient for protection.
This species is univoltine. Females lay their eggs in May and caterpillars undergo chrysalis throughout the winter. Pupation occurs in June or July.
Taxonomy.
"Papilio appalachiensis" is a member of the Lepidoptera order and "Papilio" genus. "P. appalachiensis" is considered to be a hybrid of two other members of the "Papilio" genus: "Papilio canadensis" and "Papilio glaucus".
Distribution.
The butterfly is found in the eastern United States, specifically in the Appalachian Mountains ranging from Pennsylvania to Georgia. It is notably larger than both the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail as well as the Canadian Tiger Swallowtail.
Evolution.
"Papilio appalachiensis" is thought to have evolved as a hybrid species of two other "Papilio" butterflies: "Papilio canadensis" (the Canadian Tiger Swallowtail) and "Papilio glaucus" (the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail). Originally, researchers believed that "P. canadensis" and "P. glaucus" were distributed in distinct regions separated by a hybrid zone stretching east from Minnesota to southern New England and south along the Appalachian Mountains. In 2005 researchers suggested that these two species interacted at some point and produced the new hybrid "P. appalachiensis" in the hybrid zone.
Although each species of Tiger Swallowtail butterflies is usually confined to a specific "thermal landscape", based on specific X-linked markers and various behavioral traits, laboratory and observational studies have shown the hybrid Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail butterflies have emerged. Data collected about oviposition preferences and larval mortality rates further suggest hybridization between "P. canadensis" and "P. glaucus". Due to shifting thermal landscapes, the ranges of both "P. glaucus" and "P. canadensis" have moved dramatically enough to overlay, leading to cross-breeding that has resulted in "P. appalachiensis".
Although hybrid speciation is often difficult to achieve, given the difficulty of finding a habitat separate from either parental species (competitive exclusion) and remaining genetically distinct from the parental species (reproductive isolation), "Papilio appalachiensis" accomplishes this by living in a separate habitat: a higher elevation in the Appalachian Mountains.
Appearance.
The Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail has similarities to both parent species; it resembles "P. canadensis" as it is adapted to a cooler temperature and has only one brood per year (univoltine), but also resembles "P. glaucus" as it displays sex-limited polymorphism with the dark female morph displaying mimicry. However, research has shown that "P. appalachiensis" may be more closely related genetically to "P. canadensis" than to "P. glaucus".
Females of "P. appalachiensis" are generally larger than those of "P. glaucus". Their wings are slightly angular and have vertical black stripes that are narrower than those on "P. glaucus". The hindwing scallops are also less curved and more angular than those of "P. glaucus". Additionally, the spots on their hindwings are also less crescent-shaped and rectangular compared to those of "P. glaucus". Males' hindwings tend to be more triangular.
The female has two forms: yellow and black. For both the yellow and black forms, there is a slight blue tint on the topside of the hindwings that is significantly reduced from the stronger blue tint on those of the Tiger Swallowtails. On the topside of the hindwing, there is a large orange spot. Their wingspan is . Initially, it was believed that there were no black forms of "P. appalachiensis", but researchers found two black females on the summit of Spruce Knob in West Virginia.
Caterpillar.
The caterpillars of "Papilio" species are usually smooth and vary in color from green to yellow-orange. In addition, they have black markings to mimic the appearance of bird droppings or the head of another bug with large "eyes". The "eye" consists of areas of yellow ringed with black with a smaller, light purple spot (also ringed in black) inside.
Additionally, there is a small black spot on top of the "eye", that gives it the appearance of a true eye. This form of mimicry provides a natural defense mechanism against potential predators. In addition to their appearance, every caterpillar of the Swallowtail family has an osmeterium: a special scent gland behind the head that, when disturbed, is everted from its pouch and releases a foul odor. The gland is orange-red, fleshy, forked, and generally intimidating to potential predators. The mimicry induced by the eye spots and forked gland give the caterpillar the appearance of a snake, adding to its defense mechanisms against potential predators. The caterpillar lives in a nest that it creates in the trees by folding a leaf over itself and pulling together the two halves with silk. By the time it is ready to undergo metamorphosis, the caterpillar can grow to be up to 5 cm (2 in) long. It takes about a month for the egg to develop into an adult. Fully grown caterpillars tend to be green. After hatching, the caterpillar usually eats the egg shell.
The caterpillars have been known to eat from the Black Cherry.
Ecology.
Life cycle.
The Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail is univoltine. Female butterflies will usually lay their singular brood from May to June. During the mating season, the males will fly through the treetops, scouting for females. Females, on the other hand, tend to be difficult to find because they prefer to hide in the forest canopy.
After mating, females lay their eggs singularly on host plant leaves. The caterpillars, after hatching, then eat the host plant's leaves and undergoes chrysalis throughout the winter. Pupation occurs around late June to July and pupae diapause until spring. Adults will hatch in May.
Habitat.
Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail butterflies tend to congregate in the woodlands and woodland openings. They prefer to remain in mid level to high elevations in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and the species' range stretches from Pennsylvania to Georgia and Alabama. This species is extremely prevalent at higher elevations but can also be found at lower elevations or valleys within mountainous terrain. The adult butterflies tend to remain in the canopy of the Appalachian hardwood forest and mainly only leave when visiting flowers. The habitats often parallel the habitats of "P. glaucus".
Host plants.
Adult Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail butterflies drink nectar from many plants including the mountain laurel ("Kalmia latifolia"), the pink azalea ("Rhododendron nudiflorum"), the blackberry ("Rubus"), the cockspur thorn ("Crataegus crus-galli"), the multiflora rose ("Rosa multiflora"), and the bush honeysuckle ("Diervilla"). Near the summit, they also tend to nectar from the autumn olive ("Elaeagnus commutata"), but at lower elevation, they nectar from the daisy fleabane ("Erigeron ramosus").
Flight patterns.
The Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail shares a delayed flight pattern and many other hybrid-like traits to "P. glaucus" and "P. canadensis" despite its genetic isolation. Its flight period is in May. Some individuals take flight during late June while others will fly from May to early June. Populations of this species make annual migrations of over . "Papilio appalachiensis" usually has a singular flight period from spring to early summer and emerges later than "P. glaucus". It has been observed that the Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail tends to fly directly up the western side of Spruce Knob towards the summit against strong westerly winds. The summit contains substantial vegetation within protected nooks where the adult butterflies rest and obtain nectar from various plants.

Killer NIC

The Killer NIC (Network Interface Card), from Killer Gaming, is designed to circumvent the Microsoft Windows TCP/IP stack, and handle processing on the card via a dedicated network processor. Most standard network cards are host based, and make use of the primary CPU. The manufacturer claims that the Killer NIC is capable of reducing network latency and lag. The card was first introduced in 2006.
Hardware and Models.
The Killer NIC comes in 2 models; the K1 and the M1. Both models contain a Freescale PowerQUICC processor, 64 MB RAM, a single Gigabit Ethernet port, as well as a single USB 2.0 port, intended for use with specialized programs running on the card's embedded Linux operating system.
The primary difference between the models is that the M1 has a stylized metallic heat sink, and a processor running at 400 MHz, while the K1 lacks a heat sink, and runs at only 333 MHz. Currently performance differences between the cards are limited, although it is believed that future programs designed for the cards will be capable of utilizing the increased processing power of the M1.
Killer NIC is offered as a stand alone product or is bundled with computers from OEMs like the Dell XPS 630.
Flexible Network Architecture / Game Networking DNA.
The Flexible Network Architecture is a framework used to create and run Flexible Network Applications. These applications run on the embedded Linux operating system, and are accessed through a driver interface within the host computer's operating system. Aside from that, they use a very little of the computers resources, instead handling processing on the card's processing unit. Bigfoot Networks has released a software development kit (SDK) that allows third-party developers to create their own applications. Bigfoot also publishes some of their own applications; these include a firewall, BitTorrent client, FTP application, and Telnet service that allows access to the Killer NIC's OS. This was considered a breakthrough at the time as independent reviews verified that gaming and downloading would proceed without interfering with each other.
Programs that download files often use the USB port to transfer data to external storage, making the Killer NIC useful as a NAS albeit at the generally higher power draw of a desktop PC, compared to a device like a NSLU2.
More typically applications that benefit from low latency, such as Skype or SIP or older VoIP using USB devices (NetTalk, MagicJack) may benefit. As these increasingly use Ethernet directly to routers, however, which would generally be a much lower latency than using a PC and USB connection.
However, FNA is not widely supported as of 2012 and interfaces with more typical router operating systems like DD-WRT, OpenWRT, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or with proprietary router OS, have not generally been updated.
The successor technology Game Networking DNA now supported by Qualcomm Atheros remains a Microsoft Windows-only solution
Reception.
Early reactions to the Killer NIC centered on price, with its initial MSRP of $280.
This led to widespread skepticism and speculation that the product was merely attempting a money grab, hoping to cash in on the "bling" aspect of enthusiast computing.
However, using a "F.E.A.R." benchmark IGN found that the Killer NIC increased framerate from 15.41 to 23.5 frame/s. While recognizing the potential for real performance gains, they also noted that the test systems were already struggling with the game, and that having a higher-end machine in the first place could offset the gains made by the Killer NIC. This supposition was supported by Anandtech's findings, which showed some real, but much less dramatic gains. IGN declined to rate the card with a score, saying that more testing with other games would be needed. They remarked that the potential performance gain with the Killer NIC was probably higher than upgrading a $300 video card from one generation to the next. Anandtech noted that the people who would stand to gain the most benefit from the Killer NIC, the low-end users, would also be the ones least likely to pay $280 for a network card.

Radial polarization

A beam of light has radial polarization if at every position in the beam the polarization (waves) (electric field) vector points towards the centre of the beam. In practice, an array of waveplates may be used to provide an approximation to a radially polarized beam. In this case the beam is divided into segments (eight, for example), and the average polarization vector of each segment is directed towards the beam centre. 
Radial polarization can be produced in a variety of ways. It is possible to use a liquid crystal device to convert the polarization of a beam to a radial state, or a radially polarized beam can be produced by a laser in which the Brewster window is replaced by a cone at Brewster's angle. A related concept is azimuthal polarisation, in which the polarisation vector is tangential to the beam. If a laser is focussed along the optic axis of a birefringent material, the radial and azimuthal polarizations focus at different planes. A spatial filter can be used to select the polarization of interest
A radially polarized beam can be used to produce a smaller focused spot than a more conventional linearly or circularly polarized beam, and has uses in optical trapping.

Sadaat Baba

Sadaat Baba is one of the villages of Lund Khwar, in Mardan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The village is located to the east of Lund Khwar.
The name Sadaat Baba comes from a shrine to a saint of the same name in the village. 
The village was founded by two brothers,"Ahmad Khan" and "Rehmat Khan" who were members of the Badrashi tribe. Later, members of the Miangan tribe also came to live in the village. Hence most people living in the village belong to one of these tribes.
Some relics of ancient times can be found in the Eastern outskirts of the village. These relics are believed to belong to the age of Buddha.
Tribes.
Besides the Badrashi and the Miangan, people from tribes such as the Baghwanan and the Kulalan also live in Sadaat Baba.
Shrine.
The shrine of the saint Sadaat Baba is a prominent feature, and is located in the middle of the village. Many stories exist about the saint. Some people say that thieves cannot enter their village due to the presence of the shrine. Some say that the peace that exists in their village is due to the presence of this shrine.
Localities.
The main village is divided into two distrcits: Badrakho Cham and Miagano Cham. The population of the village is growing, as outsiders are moving into an Eastern extension of the village, known as Derai.
Schools.
There are two Government primary schools in the village. One for the boys and other for the girls. 
Beside, there is also a private school running within the village. After primary school, the children seek their higher studies either in Kotki, a village nearby or in Lund Khawar.
Geography.
there is a road in the middle of sadat baba which connect lund khawar and katlong through sadat baba.
badrashi is locateted fron one side of the road and maingan is from other side.
Sadaat Baba is bordered by a canal to the west, and Laiq Ustad House, and the villages of Shamshi Koktki to the East. The village of Shahi Abad is located to the North, the villages of Salak and Ghondai to the South, and the village of Dara to the North West.

Räuchermann

The Räuchermann (diminutive Räuchermännchen), erzgebirgisch "Raachermannel" is an "incense smoker", the invention of toy makers in the Ore Mountains and used to burn down cone incense, known as "Räucherkerzchen".
The Räuchermann was first mentioned in 1850 and is nowadays a common component in the Ore Mountain Christmas tradition. For this, a cone incense is set on first, then put on the lower part of the bifid wood figurine. The upper part is hollowed out and put on top of the first part. The cone incense burns down inside of the hollow figurine, the smoke leaving the mouth hole of the Räuchermann. 
Before the Räuchermann was invented, cone incense was displayed and burnt down in the open.
During Christmas time, Räuchermänner are displayed together with "Schwibbogen" candle arches, miners' figurines, angels and Christmas pyramids.
Several kinds of figurines exist, traditionally displaying craftsmen of the region, such as foresters, peddlers, miners, and soldiers. Today, they exist in many more forms, including the so-called edgesitters, which can be placed on the edge of the table, small sceneries of several Räuchermänner (such as a group playing Skat), and also female "Räuchermänner", called "Räucherfrauen". 
According to the Guinness Book of Records, the largest "Räuchermann" in the world is in the Miniaturenpark Kleinwelka in Bautzen.
"Moosmännel".
As analogy to the "Räuchermann", the upper Vogtland invented the "Moosmann" (or "Moosmännel"). He is supposed to be a small forest spirit, who helps poor families with natural products, could change leaves to gold, and - according to folk tales mostly appears during Christmas time.

Trevor Redmond

Trevor Redmond (born 16 June 1927 in Christchurch, New Zealand) - died 1997) was a speedway rider who mainly rode for the Aldershot Shots, and the Wembley Lions. Redmond also opened a speedway track in Neath, Wales in 1962.
Career.
Rider.
Redmond started riding speedway in 1949 at the Aranui track in Christchurch. He moved to the UK when he won a team place with the newly formed Aldershot Shots in 1950. He was successful enough to attract the Wembley Lions to sign him in 1951, where he remained until their closure in 1956. Whilst with the Lions, Redmond qualified for two World Championship finals.
A season in non-league speedway followed in 1957 but in 1958 he did not ride at all, instead he opened a track in Cornwall at St Austell. He returned to racing for a spell with the Swindon Robins and moved onto the Bristol Bulldogs in 1960. The Bristol track closed at the end of that season and in 1961 Redmond had a brief spell with the Wolverhampton Wolves. In subsequent years he was rider and promoter of league teams at Neath,(1962,) St.Austell,(1963) and Glasgow,(1964-65.) He was one of only 2 riders to appear in all 5 Provincial League Riders Championship Finals, being winner in 1960, and a disappointed Runner-Up in 1961 after a broken chain in his final ride cost him the title.
Promoter.
In 1958, Redmond promoted at St Austell, on an open licence, and in 1961, he also promoted open meetings in Dublin (Shelbourne). In 1962, he opened a track in Neath, Wales. The team was named the Neath Welsh Dragons and operated in the Speedway Provincial League. The team finished in second place, which was considered a remarkable achievement by the speedway press. Neath folded at the start of the 1963 season, so Redmond took the St Austell Gulls into the Provincial League. In 1964 he continued to both ride and promote, but this time with the Glasgow Tigers, which he reopened and operated from the White City Stadium. He stopped finally riding in 1964, but continued to promote the club until the start of the 1967 season. In 1970, Redmond was influential in the reopening of speedway at Wembley Stadium, with the return of the Wembley Lions. He was later a member of the FIM and was involved in the administration of international speedway, and he managed New Zealand speedway teams. He died at his home in Glastonbury in 1997.
World final appearances.
Trevor set up the business Autospeed and opened tracks in Newton Abbot and St Austell where they raced Bangers, Hot Rods and stock cars. Autospeed were the first to run Auto Rods which were to beome the Saloon Stock Cars. They were also the first to run SuperRods which started as Jags and Fords as big engined Hotrods.

Federated Malay States Railways

The Federated Malay States Railways (FMSR) was a consolidated railroad operator in British Malaya (present day Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore) during the first half of the 20th century. Named after the then recently formed Federated Malay States in 1896 and founded five years after the formation of the federation, the company acquired various railways that were developed separately in various parts of Malaya, and oversaw the largest expansion and integration of the colonies' rail network encompassing the Federated Malay States, the Unfederated Malay States (except Trengganu) and the Straits Settlements, with lines spanning from Singapore to the south to Padang Besar (near the border with Siam) to the north.
History.
Predecessors.
Until the formation of the FMSR, Malaya's railway systems were fragmented and concentrated in the commercially active west coast of the peninsula; none of the systems were originally intended for interstate travel, and were originally founded to fulfill specific purposes. By the end of the 19th century, Malaya had at least six separate railway companies:
Frank Swettenham and the founding of the FMSR.
The formation of the Federated Malay States (FMS) in 1896 led to a centralisation of Residential power and improved coordination of development in the new founded federation. In the same year, the newly appointed residents-general of the FMS, Frank Swettenham, proposed a master plan to extend and connect railway networks within the FMS and Province Wellesley.
Swettenham's proposal encompassed three phases: The first was to be the construction of a "development" line towards the north that would connect Perak's railways with those of Selangor's and the Province Wellesley's, while running through valuable but underdeveloped land in between; the second phase consisted of an extension of the line to Kuala Lipis, Pahang's then administrative capital, to promote the development of the state's mineral industry; the third section was to be a southwards extension from the Selangor Railway's southern terminus in Cheras to Seremban, connecting Selangor Railway to Sungei Ujong Railway and providing direct connectivity from Prai to the north to Port Dickson to the south.
Swettenham's proposal was approved by the Colonial Office under the justification wide-ranging transport linkages would allow access to land for use in agriculture and diversify the region's sources of revenue, while improving administrative efficiency by linking the FMS with the Straits Settlements (widening the scope of the plan to include additional linkages to the Straits Settlements of Malacca and Singapore).
Construction of the connections began in 1897 and concluded in 1903 with the Prai-Port Dickson line completed. The FMSR was founded in 1901 in the process, combining assets of Perak Railway and Selangor Railway as the two railway networks were the first to be connected. Management of stations and railways within the two networks were turned over to the FMSR, while locomotives originally operated by the two companies were absorbed into the FMSR and renumbered in July 1901. The amalgamation of other railway companies into the FMSR would follow in the coming years.
Extensions.
While the Prai-Port Dickson line was completed in 1903, extensions were still required to connect the network with Malacca and Singapore. The extension southwards led to the formation of two short-lived railway companies largely intended to oversee the construction of lines within their state borders.
The Malacca Government Railway (MGR) was awarded a concession by the state government for the construction a railway line between Tampin and Malacca Town, as well as an extension of the main line between Malacca's state border with Negeri Sembilan that leads to Gemas. Upon completion of the lines, the MGR was absorbed into the FMSR in 1905.
In 1904, the Johore state government signed an agreement with
Amalgamation

World War II.
In 1948, FMSR was renamed as the Malayan Railway Administration, which in turn became Keretapi Tanah Melayu on Malaysia's independence in 1962.
Rolling stock.
Locomotives.
As the FMSR first grew through mergers of existing state railway operators, the majority of its locomotive fleet during its first decade were merely absorbed from merged railway companies and renumbered. The FMSR began ordering its own locomotives by 1907, continuing to do so up to the Japanese invasion of Malaya in World War II.
Virtually all locomotives operated by the FMSR were steam locomotives manufactured by various builders in the United Kingdom. The locomotives were also known to assume all-black liveries throughout the existence of the FMSR, with the exception of the Johore Railway, which used Catalonian blue.
Rolling stock.
FMSR Class A.
Old A (1901—1933).
The FMSR Class A was the first designated series of locomotives in use by the FMSR. Consisted of 18 4-4-0T tank locomotives originally purchased by numerous state railways, the locomotives served as the FMSR's backbone fleet before the arrival of newer FMSR-ordered locomotives.
The Class A was designated in July 1901 for 12 locomotives originally assigned for both the Perak Railway and Selangor Railway and manufactured between 1884 and 1898, consisting of 11 from manufactured by the Hunslet Engine Company and one from the Selangor Railway produced by Neilson & Company. The Class A designation was further assigned to two 1904 Hunslet locomotives from the Malacca Railway in 1905, and four 1901-1903 Singapore Railway Hunslet locomotives in 1912.
Several Class A Selangor Railway locomotives were known to have been converted to run on oil rather than firewood to cut cost, years before the formation of the FMSR Class A. In addition, the outer cylinders of the Class A were rebuilt with a dimension of 11" by 16" from the original 10" by 16".
The Class A was gradually retired beginning the 1920s when new locomotives were introduced into the FMSR network. From 1912 onwards, certain Class A's were also transferred to the Construction Department; FMSR 71 (Malacca Railway 2) was sold to Siam for use in coal mining assignments in 1924. The last Class A, FMSR 34 (Perak Railway 19), was withdrawn in 1933.
New A (1941—1946).
Encompassing only three 1928 Hunslet single engine 0-6-0T OCs, the "new" FMSR Class A was originally delivered to Singapore for use in the construction of the Sembawang Naval Base in 1929, and remained stored in the base after its construction was completed. In 1941, the FMSR acquired the locomotives, reintroducing the Class A designation for the locomotives. When introduced in 1941, the FMSR had retire the last original Class A locomotive, allowing the designation to be reused for a new series of locomotives.
The locomotives were only briefly used, surviving World War II, before renumbered by the FMSR in 1946 and sold to the Singapore Harbour Board in September of that year.
FMSR Class B.
The 4-4-0T FMSR Class B locomotives were heavier, more powerful versions of the original Class A, with extended tanks. Also originated from local state railways, the series was, however, made up of a smaller number of locomotives, compared to the Class A, with only seven.
Like the Class A, the Class B was introduced in 1901 with the redesignation of the two Perak Railway locomotives, one from Hunslet, and another from Hawthorn Leslie. In 1910, the Class B fleet would see another addition, another Hunslet locomotive from the Johore Railway, followed by another three from Singapore Railway (two Hunslets and one Hawthorn Leslie) and two Hunslets from Johore Railway in 1912.
Class B locomotives were retired as new locomotives were delivered for the FMSR. While four Class B locomotives were removed from the active fleet during the 1920s with the last Class B withdrawn in 1932, three others were sold to the Malayan Collieries in 1923 and 1925.
FMSR Class C.
Old C (1901—1928).
With seven originally built between 1893 and 1894, FMSR Class C locomotives were essentially 4-4-0T Class B locomotives with additional four-wheel tenders. As were other pre-FMSR locomotives, the Class Cs were absorbed from a state railway company, specifically, the Perak Railway, between 1901 and 1903. The Class Cs consisted of two locomotives from Neilson, three from Kitson & Company, and two from Hawthorn Leslie. All Class Cs were known to feature outer cylinders measuring 12" by 18", 3' 3" driving wheels, and 140 lbs of boiler pressure.
In 1907, the two Class C Hawthorn Leslie locomotives were passed to the then independent Johore Railway, two years before the opening of the state's line in 1909, and returned to the FMSR in 1912. All Class C locomotives would later be remove from service and scrapped between 1924 and 1928.
New C (1929—1970s).
By 1929, all original Class C locomotives were removed from active service, allowing the Class C designation to be reassigned to a new series of locomotives. The "new" FMSR Class C locomotives was introduced in 1929, beginning with a fleet of five locomotives from Nasmyth, Wilson and Company and saw the addition of 11 from the North British Locomotive Company between 1939 and 1940, expanding the fleet to encompass 16 locomotives.
All Class C locomotives were 38' 11"-long 4-6-4T side tank engines with two cylinders measuring 14½" by 22". Differences may be noted with the 1929 Class C and the 1939—1941; among others, the 1929 series was lighter (73 tons compared to the later series' 74.1 tones) but featured a smaller fire grate (at compared to the later series' 28 sq ft).
An additional six orders from North British were completed in 1941, but were redirected by the War Department of the United Kingdom to Egypt for use as military locomotives in World War II. The six locomotives were allocated FMSR numbers after the war, but a dispute over payment arose as the locomotives were no longer new. Subsequently all six locomotive were sold to the Royal Jordanian Hashemite Railway in 1949 and delisted from the FMSR by 1951.
The remaining Class Cs were presumably scrapped by Malayan Railways during the 1960s and 1970s.
FMSR Class D.
Designated as FMSR numbers 22 to 25, the FMSR Class D was a series of 4-6-0 locomotives with four-wheel tenders that originated from the Selangor Railway and given the Class D designation upon its entry into the FMSR fleet in July 1901. Consisting of only four locomotives, the Class D included two locomotives from Kitson (built 1894, numbers 3530 and 3531) and two from Dübs and Company (built 1895, numbers 3220 and 3221).
FMSR 24 was scraped in 1926, followed by the rest of the Class Ds in 1928.
FMSR Class E.
Designated as FMSR numbers 30 and 31, the FMSR Class E was introduced in July 1901 as a fleet of two Kitson 4-6-0 locomotives with four-wheel tenders, both originated from the Perak Railway (built 1896 with works numbers 3681 and 3682). In comparison to the Class D, the Class E feature larger drive wheels.
The Class E was scraped entirely between 1929 and 1930.
FMSR Class F.
Designated as FMSR numbers 32 and 33, the FMSR Class F was a pair of Sharp, Stewart and Company 4-4-0 locomotives with four-wheel tenders built in 1897 for the Selangor Railway (with Sharp Stewart works numbers 4267 and 4268).
Both locomotives were scrapped in 1929 and 1930.
FMSR Class G.
Designated as FMSR numbers 36 and 69, the FMSR Class G was introduced in July 1901 with a starting fleet of 21 locomotives from both the Perak Railway and the Selangor Railway, followed by two from the Malacca Railway in 1905 and an additional 11 orders directed to the FMSR between 1903 and 1905, bringing a total of 34 locomotives. The Class G was thus the largest FMSR fleet to include locomotives absorbed from state railways following the formation of the FMSR.
While the Class Gs were largely similarly built 4-6-0 locomotives with six-wheel tenders; all 34 of them were manufactured by four separate locomotive companies between 1898 and 1905. 16 were from Kitson, 9 were from Hunslet, three were from Robert Stephenson and Company, and two were from Neilson, Reid and Company.
The Class G was largely retired between 1928 in 1938. The last two Class Gs were withdrawn from service in July 1947.
FMSR Class H.
The FMSR Class H was the first FMSR class to consist of locomotives entirely ordered after the formation of the FMSR. Delivered in the form of three batches between 1907 and 1914, three companies, Kitson, Nasmyth Wilson and Robert Stephenson, would produce a total of 54 Class H locomotives for the FMSR, while another 6 were delivered to the Johore Railway in 1908 before its absorption together with the rest of Johore Railway into the FMSR in 1912.
The Class H consisted of 4-6-2 locomotives with 8-wheel, dual bogie tenders. While nearly consistent in design, 11 1908 Class H locomotives from Kitson featured thicker frames that increased each of their weights by over 2½ tons.
The Class Hs may be distinguished by the order of the batch they were in: The first batch of 17 locomotives delivered between 1907 and 1908 were referred as "Class H1" locomotives, the second batch of 17 locomotives delivered between 1908 and 1912 were referred as "Class H2" locomotives, while the last batch of 15 locomotives received between 1913 and 1914 were referred as "Class H3" locomotives (of which two were redesignated as a "Class H4" locomotives in 1924).
The entire Class H fleet remain in service until the entire stock of Class H1s was scrapped between 1930 and 1934. The H2s and H3s were partially decommissioned before 1946, but were selected in limited numbers in 1946 for use in the Malayan Railways: Six H2s were numbered MR 501.01 to 501.06, while five H3s were numbered MR 501.07 and 501.11. The remaining 11 Class Hs remained in service at least before the 1960s and 1970s.
Builder details:
FMSR Class I.
The FMSR Class I was built for the FMSR by three locomotive companies between 1907 and 1916 and delivered in five batches between 1908 and 1916. Upon the delivery of the last batch, the Class I included a total of 31 locomotives. The Class I was a 0-6-4T tank locomotives with tanks of varying sizes: The first batch featured 800 gallon tanks, while the third batch featured 1200 gallon tanks.
The first batch, delivered 1908, encompassed five locomotives from Kitson (works numbers 4527 to 4531) built between December 1907 and January 1908, followed by an additional three from North British in 1912 (works numbers 19909 to 19911), eight and ten from Kitson in 1913 (works numbers 4946 to 4953) and 1914 (works numbers 5021 to 5030), and five from Hawthorn Leslie in 1916 (works numbers 3146 to 3150).
Between 1927 and 1945, 13 Class I were decommissioned. While 18 Class Is remained in service in 1946 to receive a new locomotive number, virtually all of the class were withdrawn from the FMSR's and MR's rolling stocks by 1953. Two Class Is were sold to the Malayan Collieries in 1951 and 1953.
Builder details:
FMSR Class J.
The FMSR Class J was a fleet of three 1891 Dübs (2462 to 2464) locomotives that served the Sungei Ujong Railway and was absorbed into the FMSR in 1908. Originally 0-6-2T tank locomotives, the trains were previously rebuilt as 4-4-2T locomotives in 1902. The trains were assigned FMSR numbers 99 to 101.
Having served for 20 years, the J Class was gradually withdrawn between the late 1910s and early 1920s. FMSR 99 was sold to the Malayan Collieries on April 1922, while FMSR 100 was retired on May 1919 and followed by the FMSR 101 on November 1924.
FMSR Class K.
Old K (1908—1926).
Like the J Class, the FMSR Class K originated as part of Sungei Ujong Railway's rolling stock, before the railway company was absorbed into FMSR in 1908. The K Class consisted of only a single 1899 Dübs (works number 3621) 4-4-2T locomotive, and was significantly larger than the J Class.
The Class K was withdrawn on August 1926.
New K (1928—1970s).
As the K Class designation was vacant following the retirement of the sole K Class locomotive in 1926, a new series of locomotives was introduced in the following year to take its place. Bearing FMSR numbers 151 to 161, the "new" FMSR Class K was introduced in 1928 for use for the then newly opened East Coast Line that served the East Coast of British Malaya, with 11 in total built. The Class K was delivered in two batches; the first in the form of seven locomotives built by Beyer-Peacock in 1927 (works numbers 6373 to 6379) and delivered 1928, followed by another four by Robert Stephenson in 1929 (works numbers 4013 to 4016) and delivered 1930. The locomotives were distinguished as K1 for those from the first batch and K2 for those from the second batch.
Based on the earlier Class L, the Class K was a 4-6-2 tender locomotive with an 8-wheel bogie tender. The first batch of Class Ks were essentially improved version of the L Class; further improvement were made on the second batch. With an overall length of 56' 4" and cylinders measuring at 17" by 24", the Class K weighs in a total of 91.3 tons (55.5 tons from the locomotive and 35.8 tons from the tender).
While records exists of three Class K1s and three Class K2s shipped to Burma during Japanese occupation in World War II for use in the Thailand-Burma Railway, the entire K Class fleet was accounted for when it was renumbered in 1946. The K1 Class was entirely withdrawn between 1958 and 1959, while the K2 Class remain in use well into the 1970s, when all steam locomotives were withdrawn.
Builder details:
FMSR Class L.
Designated as FMSR numbers 214 to 233, the FMSR Class L was introduced 1921 with the arrival of 20 Kitson locomotives (works numbers 5300 to 5319), which were completed and tested between January and April 1921.
Ordered to eliminate double-heading of express services, the Class L was an improved and more powerful variant of the Class P, intended to haul longer coaches with lesser need for additional motive power. Like the Class P, the Class L was a 4-6-2 tender locomotive pulling an 8-wheel bogie tender. The Class L is 56' 4" long, weighs 88.4 tons and features cylinders measuring 17" by 24".
During Japanese occupation of Malaya in World War II, five Class Ls (FMSR 216, 220, 222, 224 and 229) were taken to the Thailand-Burma Railway. Following surrender by the Japanese in 1945, all five of the Class L were returned, with all Class Ls renumbered in 1946. The fleet continued to serve the FMSR and MR into the 1970s, by which the entire class would be withdrawn by MR. The first Class L built and the remaining Class L in the MR fleet, FMSR 214/MR 531.01, was donated to the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur in 1971, where it is now a permanent outdoor exhibit.

Turkish Brigade

The Turkish Brigade (code name "North Star", or "Kutup Yıldızı") was a Turkish Army Infantry Brigade that served under United Nations command during the Korean War between 1950 to 1953. Attached to the U.S. 25th Infantry Division the Turkish Brigade fought in several actions, and was awarded Unit Citations from Korea and the United States after fighting in the Kunuri Battle.
Background.
On 29 June 1950 the government of the Republic of Turkey replied to the United Nations Resolution 83 requesting military aid to South Korea, following the attack initiated by North Korea on 25 June. The cable stated: "Turkey is ready to meet his responsibilities." On 25 July 1950 the Turkish government decided to send a brigade of 5,000 troops comprising three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion and auxiliary units, to fight under UN Command against North Korea and subsequently the People's Republic of China. Turkey was the second country to answer the UN call, after the United States.
Service history.
Three different Turkish Brigades served in the Korean War, each replacing the previous one each year. The core of the 1st Turkish Brigade was the 241st Infantry Regiment based at Ayaş which was supplemented with volunteers to raise it to brigade level. Brigadier General Tahsin Yazıcı, a veteran of World War I, who had volunteered to be demoted to lead this force, commanded the 1st Brigade.
The advance party of the Turkish Brigade arrived in Pusan on 12 October 1950. The main body arrived five days later, October 17 from the eastern Mediterranean port of Iskenderun, Turkey, and the brigade went into bivouac near Taegu where it underwent training and received U.S. equipment. The brigade was attached to the U.S. 25th Infantry Division.
The bulk of the enlisted men were from small towns and villages in the mountains of eastern Turkey. For these volunteer officers and volunteer enlisted men who were just completing their compulsory two year service, it was not only the first time that they had left their native country—it was the first time they had been out of the villages of their birth. It was, at least for the enlisted men, the first time that they had encountered non-Muslims. Vast cultural and religious differences existed between the Turks and the Americans.
The U.S. Army command was unaware of the difficulties in coordination, logistics and, above all, basic communication in a common language that would complicate orders and troop movements, especially in the crucial early months of their joint exercises. Unfamiliar food, clothing requirements and transportation would come to create more problems than the American high command had counted on.
The dietary requirements of the Turks forbade pork products, and the American rations contained pork products forbidden to all Muslims. A Japanese cook was hired to provide rations that met the Turkish requirements. Bread and coffee presented other problems. The Turks favored a heavy, substantial bread containing non-bleached flour along with thick, strong, heavily sweetened coffee. Most of the enlisted men had fierce looks, flowing mustaches and carried a sidearm sword that, to Americans and the other U.N. troops, appeared to be a long knife, all of which attracted much media attention.
Few American liaison officers were attached to the Turkish companies, thereby adding to the problems the Turks faced in their initial combat operations. Misinterpretation of orders resulted from the lack of communication between Allies. The problem, at first overlooked and judged to be only minor, became exacerbated in the heat of battle.
Though it was initially placed as reserve for the U.S. 8th Army, the collapse of the front in the face of massive Chinese attacks on 26 November 1950, meant that it soon found itself in the thick of battle.
The Turkish brigade, between November 1950 and July 1953, fought in the following battles:
The brigade's most costly battle was Kunu-ri, which took place towards the end of 1950. Actually a series of four encounters lasting from 26 November to 6 December 1950; Battle of Wawon on 28 November, Sinnim-ni, 28–29 November, Kunuri Gorge, 29–30 November, and Sunchon Gorge on 30 November 1950. The brigade lost over 15% of its personnel and 70% of equipment at Kunuri, with 218 killed and 455 wounded, and close to 100 taken prisoner.
After the battle of Kumyangjang-Ni, 25–26 January, in which the Turkish Brigade repulsed a Chinese force three times its size, President Harry Truman signed a Distinguished Unit Citation (now the Presidential Unit Citation) on 11 July 1951. The brigade was also awarded the Presidential Unit Citation from the President of Korea.
Composition.
The Turkish Armed Forces Command (TAFC) was a regimental combat team with three infantry battalions, along with supporting artillery and engineers. The three battalions were commanded by Major Imadettin Kuranel, Major Mithat Ulunu, and Major Lütfü Bilgon. It was the only brigade-sized UN unit attached permanently to a U.S. division throughout the Korean War.
The Turkish Brigade comprised:
Losses.
Overall losses for the Turkish Brigade in Korea was 721 killed in action, 2,111 wounded and 168 missing. A total of 14,936 men served in the brigade between 1950–1953 with about 5,455 soldiers in Korea at any one time. The United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea is the burial place for 462 of those casualties. Two memorials to the Turkish soldiers are at the cemetery.
Service in Korea.
The Brigade had a full turnover after a period of one years service. The Brigades that served for the 10 year period were numbered 1 through 10. Of these, the first three saw action. During the service of the 3rd Brigade in 1953, the Korean Armistice was signed. Thereafter, Turkey continued maintaining forces at full Brigade level for another seven years, in accordance with United Nations agreements. Kenan Evren, seventh President of Republic of Turkey, served in the Brigade from 1958–59.
Popular culture.
In 1954, a Turkish film bearing the operation code name of the Turkish Brigade ("Şimal Yıldızı"), directed by Atıf Yılmaz and starring Ayhan Işık, which praised the deeds of the unit was released.
The Turkish Brigade is featured in the Unification Church-funded 1982 film "Inchon", which inaccurately depicts the Turkish Brigade as being involved in the Battle of Inchon (in reality the Brigade did not arrive until the month after the battle). Gabriele Ferzetti plays the commander of the Brigade.

San Fernando Pioneer Memorial Cemetery

San Fernando Pioneer Memorial Cemetery, earlier known as Morningside Cemetery, is a cemetery in the Sylmar district of Los Angeles.
Located on a 3.8-acre (15,000 m²) site at the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Bledsoe Street, the Pioneer Cemetery was originally a 10-acre (400,000 m²) site. The cemetery was established in the mid-19th century and used until 1939. It was known at the time as the San Fernando Cemetery and also as the Morningside Cemetery and is the oldest non-sectarian cemetery in the San Fernando Valley. (The area's oldest cemetery is the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, which began operating in approximately 1800.) Over 740 residents were buried there between 1892 and 1939. After the cemetery was determined to be legally abandoned in 1959, it was acquired by the Native Daughters of the Golden West, San Fernando Mission Chapter, and maintained as a pioneer memorial park. Edith Reber, a longtime resident of Sylmar and an active member of the Chamber, for many years ran a volunteer effort to maintain the grounds with the help of local volunteer groups. It is located on what is currently the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Bledsoe Street.
It was listed as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1993. As "San Fernando Cemetery", it is a California Historical Landmark.

Tomb of Sher Shah Suri

The tomb of Sher Shah Suri is in the Sasaram town of Bihar state, India. The tomb was built in memory of Emperor Sher Shah Suri, a Pathan from Bihar who defeated the Mughal Empire and founded the Suri Empire in northern India. He died in an accidental gunpowder explosion in the fort of Kalinjar on 10th day of Rabi' al-awwal, A.H. 952 or 13 May 1545 AD. 
Architecture.
His tomb is an example of Indo-Islamic architecture, it was designed by the architect Aliwal Khan and built between 1540 and 1545, this red sandstone mausoleum (122 ft high), which stands in the middle of an artificial lake, which is nearly square, is known as the second Taj Mahal of India. The tomb stands at the centre of the lake on a square stone plinth with domed kiosks, "chhatris" at each of its corners, further there are stone banks and stepped moorings on all sides of the plinth, which is connected to the mainland through a wide stone bridge. The main tomb is built on octagonal plan, topped by a dome, 22-metre in span and surrounded ornamental domed kiosks which were once covered in coloured glazed tile work.
The tomb was built during the reign of his son Islam Shah. An inscription dates its completion to August 16, 1545, three months after the death of Sher Shah.

Milwaukee Road Depot (Marinette, Wisconsin)

The Milwaukee Road Depot in Marinette, Wisconsin was built in 1903 by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (otherwise known as The Milwaukee Road) to replace an earlier depot. 
Overview.
The depot is a one story rectangular structure in the Queen Anne style. An open, covered area is located at one end of the depot. The depot originally had two passenger waiting areas, a women's waiting room at one end and the men's waiting room and freight room at the other. The station agent's office was located between the two waiting rooms. The depot was designed by J. U. Nettenstrom, a staff architect from the railroad. Nettenstrom also designed other depots in Wisconsin. 
The railroads first entered Wisconsin for the lumber. Before the railroads, lumber had to be shipped by boat. Railroads allowed for the year-round harvesting of timber. The early economy of Marinette was based on the lumber industry. The Milwaukee Road entered Marinette in 1883. It built a spur from the mainline at Crivitz, Wisconsin to Marinette and Menominee, Michigan. 
As the number of passengers declined on the Milwaukee Road after World War II, it ceased passenger trains to Marinette and Menominee. The depot was served by buses from Crivitz. The depot continued to serve freight. In 1985, The Milawaukee Road went out of business and sold the rail line and depot to the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (E&LS). The E&LS continued to use the depot as an office until 2004. The land was sold in order to build a drugstore and to realign the city street. The depot was sold to a developer who moved it 400 feet to the south of its original position. The depot is still located adjacent to the E&LS tracks, thus preserving its setting. The developer plans to remodel the depot and make it into offices.
The depot was listed in the National Register of Historic Places because of its architecture and also because of its association with the commercial development of Marinette and with the railroad's association with the development of the timber industry.

Bruno Arpaia

Bruno Arpaia, born in Naples (Italy) in 1957, is an Italian writer and journalist.
Life.
After his degree in Political Sciences and a specialisation in American History at the University of Naples, he taught there and then became a journalist with the Italian newspaper "Il Mattino" of Naples, subsequently moving to Milan in 1989, where he worked for the daily "La Repubblica".
In 1990 he published his first novel, "I forestieri" (The Foreigners), which won the Bagutta Prize the following year. Arpaia published another three novels, after leaving the newspaper "La Repubblica" in 1998, in order to dedicate himself solely to writing and freelance journalism.
"L'Angelo della storia" (Guanda, 2001) is his most successful novel, also being selected for the prestigious Campiello Prize in 2001. Translated into English in 2006 with the title "The Angel of History" by Minna Proctor, under the patronage of the Scottish Arts Council and the Italian Cultural Institute, it tells the partly fictional story of philosopher Walter Benjamin and a young Spanish militant in 1940. Arpaia's twofold narrative retraces Benjamin's flight across Europe and the Spaniard's youthful activism, as both men battle to assert their beliefs in the face of ultimate extinction.
Arpaia lives in Milan and currently alternates between translation, journalism and writing novels. He is also a publishing consultant for several Italian newspapers and publishing houses.
Review.
Arpaia retells the Benjamin story in alternate chapters, in the third person, with counterpoint chapters in the first person by Laureano Mahojo, an anti-Franco Loyalist who spent most of his life in exile in Mexico. In the novel, Laureano meets Benjamin on the refugee trail as the writer limps into Port-Bou, the Spanish village where he committed suicide to avoid being sent to France by the border guards. Benjamin knew that, as a Marxist and Jew, as well as an outspoken critic of fascism, he would not have been greeted warmly by the Gestapo.
Bruno Arpaia's new novel doesn't aim to be an analysis of Marxist philosophy (thank heavens). Rather, he has fictionalised the end of Benjamin's life, as the philosopher escaped the Nazis for a pre-war France that was little more accommodating than Germany. Charting the equally unpleasant adventures of Laureano, a communist rebel in flight from Franco's Spain, Arpaia prepares us from the off for the final crossing of their paths at the end of the novel.

<doc id="19510532" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19510532" title="Desmethoxyyangonin">
Desmethoxyyangonin

Desmethoxyyangonin or 5,6-dehydrokawain is one of the six major kavalactones found in the "Piper methysticum" (kava) plant.
Pharmacology.
Desmethoxyyangonin is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Kava is able to increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens and desmethoxyyangonin likely contributes to this effect. This, along with the potential increases of serotonin and other catecholamine concentrations, may be responsible for the purported attention-promoting effects of kava. 
Desmethoxyyangonin has marked activity on the induction of CYP3A23.

Kavain

Kavain is the main kavalactone found mostly in the roots of the Kava plant.
Pharmacology.
Kavain has anticonvulsive properties, attenuating vascular smooth muscle contraction through interactions with voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels. How this effect is mediated and to what extent this mechanism is involved in the anxiolytic and analgesic effects of kavalactones on the central nervous system is unknown. Kavain's pharmacological activities have not been sufficiently investigated and neither its effect as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor nor its monoamine (norepinephrine) uptake inhibitions and activation of NMDA receptors have been confirmed.
The mechanism behind the psychotropic, sedative and anxiolytic actions of kavain and related kavalactones is still debated. Direct binding to the GABAA receptor (benzodiazepine-receptor) does not occur with kavain enantiomers. Many studies involved kava extracts from different plant parts and are therefore not applicable to kavain itself.
A comparative review of in-vivo studies with kavain (and related kavapyrones) to commonly used antiepileptic drugs and mood stabilizers affecting ion fluxes indicates that the kavapyrones are weakly Na+ antagonistic and therefore antiepileptic. They also have pronounced L- type Ca2+ channel antagonistic properties and act as a positive modulator of the early K+ outward current, which contribute to mood stabilizing properties similar to lamotrigine.
Kavain and analogs remain interesting for drug discovery against a variety of cellular targets, including P-glycoprotein (Pgp), cytochrome P450 and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes, among others.

<doc id="19510610" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19510610" title="Exact statistics">
Exact statistics

Exact statistics, such as that described in exact test, is a branch of statistics that was developed to provide more accurate results pertaining to statistical testing and interval estimation by eliminating procedures based on asymptotic and approximate statistical methods. The main characteristic of exact methods is that statistical tests and confidence intervals are based on exact probability statements that are valid for any sample size. 
Exact statistical methods help avoid some of the unreasonable assumptions of traditional statistical methods, such as the assumption of equal variances in classical ANOVA. They also allow exact inference on variance components of mixed models.
When exact p-values and confidence intervals are computed under a certain distribution, such as the normal distribution, then the underlying methods are referred to as exact parametric methods. The exact methods that do not make any distributional assumptions are referred to as exact nonparametric methods. The latter has the advantage of making fewer assumptions whereas, the former tend to yield more powerful tests when the distributional assumption is reasonable. For advanced methods such as higher-way ANOVA regression analysis, and mixed models, only exact parametric methods are available. 
When the sample size is small, asymptotic results given by some traditional methods may not be valid. In such situations, the asymptotic p-values may differ substantially from the exact p-values. Hence asymptotic and other approximate results may lead to unreliable and misleading conclusions.
The Approach.
All classical statistical procedures are constructed using statistics which depend only on observable random vectors, whereas Generalized Estimators, Tests, and Confidence Intervals used in exact statistics take advantage of the observable random vectors and the observed values both, as in the Bayesian approach but without having to treat constant parameters as random variables. For example, in sampling from a normal population with mean formula_1 and variance formula_2, suppose formula_3 and formula_4 are the sample mean and the sample variance. Then, it is well known that 
and that 
Now suppose the parameter of interest is the coefficient of variation, formula_7. Then, we can easily perform exact tests and exact confidence intervals for formula_8 based on the generalized statistic
where formula_10 is the observed value of formula_3 and formula_12 is the observed value of formula_13. Exact inferences on formula_8 based on probabilities and expected values of formula_15 are possible because its distribution and the observed value are both free of nuisance parameters.
Generalized p-values.
Classical statistical methods do not provide exact tests to many statistical problems such as testing Variance Components and ANOVA under unequal variances. To rectify this situation, the generalized p-values are defined as an extension of the classical p-values so that one can perform tests based on exact probability statements valid for any sample size.

Governorates of the Grand Principality of Finland

The governorates of the Grand Principality of Finland were the administrative division of the Grand Principality of Finland as part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917.
The administrative division of Finland followed the Russian imperial model with governorates (, , ) headed by governors. However few changes were made and as the language of the administrators was still Swedish the old terminology from during the Swedish time continued in local use. The Vyborg Governorate was not initially part of the Grand Principality, but in 1812 it was transferred from Russia proper to Finland.
Governorates.
After 1831 there were eight provinces in the Grand Principality.
History.
The Vyborg Governorate was established in territories ceded by the Swedish Empire in the Great Northern War. By the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, Sweden formally ceded control of the parts of the Viborg and Nyslott County and the Kexholm County located on the Karelian Isthmus to Russia. The governorate was extended in 1743 when Sweden ceded control of the rest of Viborg and Nyslott, now called the Kymmenegård and Nyslott County, by the Treaty of Åbo. In the Swedish kingdom the ceded territories was also known as Old Finland (, ), and between 1802 and 1812 it was named the "Finland Governorate".
During the Napoleonic Wars, the Kingdom of Sweden had allied itself with the Russian Empire, United Kingdom and the other parties against Napoleonic France. However, following the treaty of Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, Russia made peace with France. In 1808, and supported by France, Russia successfully challenged the Swedish control over Finland in the Finnish War. In the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on September 17, 1809 Sweden was obliged to cede all its territory in Finland, east of the Torne River, to Russia. The ceded territories became a part of the Russian Empire and was reconstituted into the Grand Principality of Finland, with the Russian Tsar as Grand Duke. 
In 1812 the Vyborg Governorate was transferred from Russia proper to the Grand Principality. The transfer, announced Tsar Alexander I just before Christmas, on December 23, 1811 O.S. (January 4, 1812 N.S.), can be seen as a symbolic gesture and an attempt to appease the sentiment of the Finnish population, which had just experienced Russian conquest of their country by force in the Finnish War.
In 1831 the Nyland-Tavastehus Governorate (, , ) was divided into the Nyland Governorate and the Tavastehus Governorate.
On the death of Tsar Nicholas I in 1855, a small group of citizens in the city of Vaasa tendered a petition to change the name of the city after him. The name of the city came from the Royal House of Vasa and despite that only 15 citizens were backing the proposal the name of the city was changed to Nikolaistad (, ). This also meant that the Vasa Governorate (, , ) was called the Nikolaistad Governorate, after 1855. In 1862 a large group of citizens in the city unsuccessfully petitioned to have the old name restored. The new name remained official until 1917, but colloquially the old name continued in use.
After being a part of Sweden for seven centuries, the first half century of Finland as a Russian Grand Grand Principality meant a period of consolidation into the Russian Empire, where the authorities managed to convince the imperial court of the loyalty of the Finnish population and the officials to Russia. This resulted in the re-establishment of the Diet of Finland and an increased autonomy, an example of which was the elevation of Finnish from a language for the common people to a national language equal to Swedish.
The period of liberalisation came to an end in 1899 when a campaign of attempted russification was initiated, and attempt that ultimately would prove unsuccessful and detrimental for Finland's relationship with Russia. The policy of russification, coupled with Russian defeat in World War I and the Tsar no longer in power paved the way for Finland's declaration of independence on December 6, 1917. The former Swedish counties, that for a century had been ruled as governorates of a Russian Grand Principality would now become provinces (, ) of an independent Republic of Finland.

Zheng Wei () (born June 13, 1981 in Qingdao) is a Chinese football player who currently plays for Chongqing F.C. as a left-footed midfielder in the China League One.
Professional career.
Shanghai Shenhua.
Zheng Wei started his football career with Shanghai Cable 02 before the club were taken over by Shanghai Shenhua in 2002. Despite being promoted to Shenhua's senior team in 2002, he would have to wait until the 2004 league season before he could make his debut. He would eventually play in 5 league games for Shanghai in the 2004 league season. This however was to prove his most successful season with Shanghai, and despite staying with them for a further two seasons he could only make a further 3 appearances for them.
Shanxi Chanba.
Zheng Wei would have a loan period with Pudong Zobon F.C. for one season before he would move to Shaanxi Chanba at the beginning of the 2007 league season where he immediately established himself as a versatile left midfielder and defensive midfielder. An immediate regular he would play in 23 league games in his debut season and see Shaanxi fight off relegation. With a fresh start in the 2008 league season, Zheng would spearhead the Shaanxi midfield that would fight for the league title, however despite an encouraging start to the season Shaanxi, finished fifth in the league. With the team unable to improve upon the previous season's results the club brought in Zhu Guanghu and then Milorad Kosanović to manage the team and Zheng saw his playing time reduced. By the end of the 2010 league season Zheng would be allowed to leave the club and he would return to Shanghai Shenhua.

The 808th Tank Destroyer Battalion was a tank destroyer battalion of the United States Army active during the Second World War.
The battalion was activated on 27 March 1942. It deployed into Normandy on 19 September, equipped with towed 3" anti-tank guns. It first saw action six days later, on the 25th, when it was attached to the 80th Infantry Division. It was detached from the 80th on 21 December, and moved to participate in the Battle of the Bulge, where it protected the flank of XII Corps through to late January. Elements of the division fought with the 5th Infantry Division in late December.
In February 1945 it re-equipped with M36 Jackson tank destroyers, and was then attached to the 76th Infantry Division for the drive to the Rhine. In April it was transferred to 65th Infantry Division and pushed through southern Germany with Third Army. At the beginning of May it moved to Linz, and ended the war inside Austria.

John Killaly

John Killaly (1776–1832) was the most significant Irish canal engineer working originally for the Grand Canal company and later, as an engineer, under the "Directors-General of Inland Navigation".
Career.
The name Killaly is rare and associated with the county of Offaly, but no record of his parentage or birthplace has been discovered and it is possible that he was born and educated in England. In around 1791 Killaly started carrying out some surveys for the Grand Canal. By 1794 he had made such an impression on the directors that he was asked to join the company at a salary of £150 per annum. By 1796 they reported that from being 'a mere measurer and surveyor' he had become 'the complete superintendent of all kinds of work'. He took on the most difficult stretch of the canal, across the Bog of Allen close to Edenderry, which at John Smeaton's suggestion had been built high across the surface of the bog. William Jessop had attempted to stem the water leakage by using 'ribs of clay' and eventually one of the directors of the company, Richard Griffith, challenged this approach and Killaly adopted a much more gentle profile that stabilized the canal, though it was to remain a problem. For the extension from Tullamore to Shannon Harbour another bog had to be crossed near the river Brosna, and this time Killaly carried out extensive drainage works over several years along the line of the canal and allowed the land to subside before excavating the canal.
By this time he had become the company's chief with a salary of around £800. On the opening of the canal in 1803 he became an engineer under the Directors-General of Inland Navigation, whilst still receiving a reduced salary from the Grand Canal company until 1810. In 1805, he was sent on a six-week fact finding tour of engineering works in England and Wales, reporting on canals, bridges, docks and rail roads. On his resignation in 1810 the Board recorded that Killaly had 'conducted himself with the most unwearied assiduity and the most perfect and unimpeached integrity' during his service to the company.
Together with John Brownrigg, he inspected the state of the River Shannon Navigation and made a comprehensive report to the Directors with a number of proposals for action on the upper part. He supervised the construction of lateral canals at Athlone and Meelick. He also advised on the Corrib, Lagan, Newry and Suir navigations. He surveyed an extension to the Royal Canal to Lough Allen but by this time the Royal Canal Co was in financial trouble and was declared bankrupt in 1813, leaving the Directors-General to complete the line to the Shannon. Killaly resurveyed the route from the summit west of Mullingar to a new entry into the Shannon using the "Camlin River". This was let as a single contract and completed substantially on time and within budget in 1817, including a major aqueduct across the River Inny. In 1814 he surveyed the line of a canal to connect Lough Erne with Lough Neagh. The plan was approved and the "Ulster Canal Co" was eventually formed in 1825 to undertake construction, though he was instructed to resurvey it to cut costs.
In 1823, he was asked to re-examine his plans for an extension of the Grand Canal to Ballinasloe in County Galway and offered to act as Directing Engineer on condition that his son, Hamilton be appointed as superintending engineer. He used his experience of driving through bogs by driving a drainage channel along the centreline of the canal with similar and interconnecting drains at 25 and 60m on each side with transverse drains. In this way a uniform settlement was achieved over a wide area, avoiding the need for high embankments.
Between 1820 and 1826, Killaly was seconded by the government to deal with some 88 miles of road improvements to provide employment in Clare, parts of Limerick, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, including numerous bridges. At times he was responsible for more than 9,000 workers in these famine relief schemes. Reporting in 1822, Killaly said "the great destruction of morals and waste of public property which have taken place in the county of Clare from this cause (jobbing) is beyond my power to calculate" and in 1830 he expressed the hope that the presentment system would be eradicated.
Family.
In 1799, Killaly married Alicia Hamilton, a daughter of George Hamilton, the owner of the principal flour mill on the Tullamore River. In 1804, Killaly leased the mill property from him at an annual rent of the £300 and moved into the Mill House, with his growing family, which eventually numbered four sons and three daughters. Three of his sons (Hamilton Hartley, Richard Griffith and Benjamin) later graduated from the University of Dublin and two of them became civil engineers like their father. Hamilton Hartley Killaly emigrated to Canada and became an engineer on the Welland Canal and later the first Chairman and Chief Engineer of the Board of Works for Lower Canada. His son became the first president of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers in 1887.
On his death in 1832 a large memorial was erected by his widow in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

The "Mirabello" class were a group of 3 destroyers built for the Regia Marina during World War I. 
The ships were designed as scout cruisers ("esploratori"), essentially enlarged versions of contemporary destroyers. All ships were built by Ansaldo in Genoa. Three ships were built but one was lost to a mine in the Black Sea in 1920, during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. The remaining two ships, obsolescent by 1938, were re-rated as destroyers and fought in World War II. The "Riboty" was reconfigured as a convoy escort. The torpedo tubes were removed and depth charges and 20mm anti-aircraft guns added.

First flown in 1938, the engine went into limited production, with testing carried out on a Blackburn Iris V biplane flying-boat aircraft and Fairey IIIF biplane.
Design.
The six cylinders were arranged vertically. Two crankshafts were located at the top and bottom of the engine and coupled together by gears. The inlet and exhaust ports were controlled by the pistons, as in a petrol-fuelled two-stroke engine.

Ornate crevice-dragon

The ornate crevice-dragon ('Ctenophorus ornatus') is a species of lizard in the Agamidae family. It is found on granite outcrops of Western Australia.
The species is a member of a diverse genus, "Ctenophorus", that contains a group known as rock dragons. It can be distinguished from the others by its greatly flattened body, around 290 mm, with a snout-to-vent length of 95 mm, and a distinctly banded tail.
"Ctenophorus ornatus" is common on granite outcrops, where it shelters under slabs and boulders, especially in undisturbed areas. When out in the open, often basking on warm rocks, it displays a head-bobbing characteristic seen in many related species.
The distribution range of this species extends from the Goldfields to the Darling Range, and to the southern coastline. It is recorded at the Archipelago of the Recherche, offshore granite islands, and a reddish form is noted in the Murchison district.

Season summary.
The 1964 season started in controversy which led to the Provincial League running 'black'. Officially the 1964 Provincial League season did not exist.
Wolverhampton Wolves refused to move up to the National League after winning the Provincial League title in 1963. The two leagues could not agree about the situation which led to the Provincial League being outlawed by the Speedway Control Board.
All National League riders were forbidden to ride on Provincial League tracks. Provincial League riders were warned by the Speedway Control Board that they were in breach of ACU regulations and could be suspended from all competitive racing. They were also barred from the Speedway World Championship.
The Stoke Potters, St Austell Gulls and Rayleigh Rockets all withdrew from the league for various reasons before the season started. The Sunderland Stars joined the league but then withdrew after riding only three matches. However Glasgow Tigers and the Newport Wasps joined and completed the season.

Shia Islam in India

Shia Muslims are a large minority among India's Muslims. However, there has been no particular census conducted in India with regards to sects, but Indian sources like Times of India and Daily News and Analysis reported Indian Shia population in mid 2005–2006 between 25% and 31% of entire Muslim population of India which accounts them in numbers between 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 of 157,000,000 Indian Muslim population. However, as per an estimation of one reputed Shia NGO Alimaan Trust, India's Shia population in early 2000 was around 30 million with Sayyids comprising just a tenth of the Shia population. According to some national and international sources Indian Shia population is the world's second-largest after Iran.
Shia population was also acclaimed publicly as second largest by the 14th Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh quoted in the year 2005. One of the lingering problems in estimating the Shia population is that unless the Shia form a significant minority in a Muslim country, the entire population is often listed as Sunni. Shiites are estimated to be 21–35 percent of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate due to the intermingling between the Islamic schools and branches and practice of taqiyya by Shias.
There are many big and small towns and villages with majority Shiite Muslim population in India. Many Sayyids between 11th to 16th century migrated to the Indian subcontinent to escape the persecution of Shias in mostly Sunni ruled Middle East, also there was peace time migration from Iran in large numbers and Sayyids from Nishapur, Sabzawar, Shiraz etc. from Iran migrated mostly to northern Indian Ganges plains. Prominent places in India with majority or considerable Shia Muslim population are Kargil, Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Lucknow and others.
One of the example traced back to 15-16th century where Sayyid from Imam Reza (A.S.) Sayyid Hishammuddin migrated from Nishapur (Khorasan Razavi Provience, Iran) to Karari and settled and prospered there from Mughal times till date. Among the Shias of India, an overwhelming majority belongs to the Ithna Ashari (Twelver) division, while the Shias among the Khoja and Bohra communities are Ismaili. Dawoodi Bohras are primarily based in India, even though the Dawoodi theology originated in Yemen. India is home to the majority Dawoodi Bohra population most of them concentrated in Gujarat out of over 1 million followers worldwide.
History.
As per historical evidences and the genealogy maintained by the Sayyids who migrated to India from Middle East and Persia the history of Shia Islam in India traces long back around 1000 years. According to historical records earliest known Muslim settlers in Awadh region (now a part of state of Uttar Pradesh) were father and son duo Saiyed Salar Dawood Ghazi and Saiyed Saiyed Salar Masud Ghazi. In 422 AH/1030 AD Saiyed Salaar Dawood Ghazi his son Saiyed Salaar Masud Ghazi and nefew Saiyed Salaar Sulaiman established themselves at Satrikh (also known as Sulaimanabad), district Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh. In the year 462 AH/1070 AD Saiyed Abdullah Zarbaqsh and Saiyed Zaid Shahsawar viz. the son-in-law and grandson (daughter's son) of Saiyed Salaar Dawood Ghazi established the town Zaidpur, district Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh. The rulers of various dynasties of India and also in the 11th century the rulers of Multan and Sindh were adherents of Shia Islam. The Nawabs of Awadh and Hyder Ali & Tipu Sultan of Mysore, who were rulers in India, were also Shia Muslims.
Shia culture and belief has left its influence all over India with Imam Hussein ibn Ali becoming the revered personality in India not only for the Shias but also from non-Muslim communities, especially the Hindus of northern India who participate in ceremonies commemorating Hussein ibn Ali's martyrdom on the Day of Ashura.
Shaykh al-Mufid writes that before the Battle of Karbala, Hussein ibn Ali and the commander of the enemy forces, Umar ibn Saad, met at night and talked together for a long time. After that meeting Umar ibn Saad sent a letter to the Governor of Kufa, Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad in which he wrote that Hussein ibn Ali has suggested that he go to ‘one of the border outposts’ of the rapidly expanding Muslim empire as a way of resolving conflict. Other traditions name that border outpost as Al Hind or India. Even though Hussein ibn Ali himself was not able to go to India, some of the Shia did emigrate there for various reasons, including those who came as refugees from Umayyads and Abbasids persecution. These refugees brought with them rituals which kept alive the remembrance of Karbala and their Shia Identity.
Its narrated by Abd al Razzaq al Muqarram in his work of Maqtal al-Husayn that prior to his martyrdom, Al-Abbas ibn Ali while asking water for Mohammad's family from the Yazid I's army expressed his desire to go either Rome or to India. This made some people weep in the army of Yazid.
It has been believed that in 7th century few ladies from the household of Prophet Mohammad after Battle of Karbala came to Punjab province which became a part of Pakistan. One of the prominent of them was Ruqayyah bint Ali, the daughter of Ali through his wife Umm ul-Banin, Ruqayyah bint Ali was the sister of Al-Abbas ibn Ali and wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel. Still her shrine in Lahore, Punjab of Pakistan, is visited by people all around and she is referred as Bibi Pak Daman.
Most of the Persians Shias migrated to South Asia to prosper and obtain high positions in Muslim Sultanates and later Mughal Empire. There were also rebels and nobles who lost royal favour and migrated to Mughal Empire. The Mughals also preferred to employ foreign Muslim officials that had no local interests and thus were loyal to the Mughal emperor. The Humayun has returned from exile in Persia with thousands of Persians soldiers and nobles this increased the influence of the Shia Persians in Mughal Empire.
Persecution.
Shiites in India faced persecution by some Sunni rulers and Mughal Emperors which resulted in the martyrdom of Indian Shia scholars like Qazi Nurullah Shustari (also known as "Shaheed-e-Thaalis", the third Martyr) and Mirza Muhammad Kamil Dehlavi (also known as" Shaheed-e- Rabay", the fourth Martyr) who are two of the five martyrs of Shia Islam.
Shias also faced persecution in India in Kashmir for centuries, by the Sunni invaders of the region which resulted in massacre of many Shias and as a result most of them had to flee the region. Shias in Kashmir in subsequent years had to pass through the most atrocious period of their history. Plunder, loot and massacres which came to be known as ‘Taarajs’ virtually devastated the community. History records 10 such Taarajs also known as ‘Taraj-e-Shia’ between 15th to 19th century in 1548, 1585, 1635, 1686, 1719, 1741, 1762, 1801, 1830, 1872 during which the Shia habitations were plundered, people slaughtered, libraries burnt and their sacred sites desecrated. Such was the reign of terror during this period that the community widely went into the practice of Taqya in order to preserve their lives and the honor of their womenfolk. Village after village disappeared, with community members either migrating to safety further north or dissolving in the majority faith. The persecution suffered by Shias in Kashmir during the successive foreign rules was not new for the community. Many of the standard bearers of Shia Islam, like Sa’adaat (Saiyeds) or the descendants of the Prophet Mohammad and other missionaries who played a key role in spread of the faith in Kashmir, had left their home lands forced by similar situations.
India's role in battle of Karbala.
Nathanvilal Wahshi, a Hindu Writer narrated about the arrival of a helper for Hussein ibn Ali’s cause on the eight day of Moharram. Hussein ibn Ali welcomed him and immediately confirmed his Indian Identity. Hussein ibn Ali then goes on to praise India and its people in the following words:
"The perfumed fragrance entered the realm of love from your country
The cool breeze came to my grandfather Mohammad from that garden."
Upon asking more about the guest’s background he finds out that he is an Indian merchant residing in neighboring city of Basra, his father had been entrusted with the treasury of the war booty by none other than Ali. For this reason the merchant holds himself morally responsible for assisting Hussein ibn Ali in any possible way when the later is in trouble. Hussein ibn Ali appreciated gesture, but discouraged the merchant from taking up arms in following words:
"Brother, in my opinion you are the beloved of the world
In this country you are the treasure of India."
Munshi Premchand further narrates the perception of this merchant on the part of Imam as suspicion about Hussein ibn Ali’s sincerity because of being a Hindu.
With tear filled eyes the traveler said:
”I am a Hindu, perhaps my fidelity is not convincing
Master! Even though this heart is the land of Idol Temple
In it is also lit the light of affection”.
Hussein ibn Ali said : What have you said in passion, Why should my eyes doubt your fidelity? My lord is aware of my conscience. What’s the difference between Hindu and Muslim is the quest for truth. This has the guiding principle for the People of the Cloak or Ahl al-Kisa. ”.
Shia Muslim Dynasties in India.
Shiite Islam has deep rooted influence in present and history of India from North to South with various Shia Muslim dynasties ruling Indian provinces from time to time.
Few prominent ones of the Indian Shia Muslim dynasties are as follows:
The Bahmani Sultanate also called the "Bahmanid Empire" or "Bahmani Kingdom" was a Muslim state of the Deccan in southern India and one of the great medieval Indian kingdoms. Bahmanid Sultanate was the first independent Islamic and Shi'ite Kingdom in South India.
The Sharqi sultanate was an independent medieval Shia Muslim dynasty of North India, one of the many kingdoms that came up following the disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate. Between 1394 CE to 1479 CE, Sharqi dynasty ruled from Jaunpur in the present day state of Uttar Pradesh.
On the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan (1348), Berar Sultanate was constituted one of the five provinces into which their kingdom was divided, being governed by great nobles, with a separate army. The perils of this system becoming apparent, the province was divided (1478 or 1479) into two separate provinces, named after their capitals Gawil and Mahur.
Bidar Sultanate was one of the Deccan sultanates of late medieval India. Its founder, Qasim Barid was a Turk, domiciled in Georgia. He joined the service of the Bahmani sultan Muhammad Shah III. He started his career as a "Sar-Naubat" but later became the "Mir-Jumla" (prime minister) of the Bahmani sultanate.
The Qutb Shahi dynasty was a Turkic dynasty (whose members were also called the Qutub Shahis). They were the ruling family of the kingdom of Golconda in southern India. They were Shia Muslims and belonged to Kara Koyunlu.
The Adil Shahi dynasty ruled the Sultanate of Bijapur in the Western area of the Deccan region of Southern India from 1490 to 1686. Bijapur had been a province of the Bahmani Sultanate (1347–1518), before its political decline in the last quarter of the 15th century and eventual break-up in 1518. The Bijapur Sultanate was absorbed into the Mughal Empire on 12 September 1686, after its conquest by the Emperor Aurangzeb.
Of all the Muslim states and dependencies of the Mughal empire, Awadh had the newest royal family, the Nawabs of Awadh. They were descended from a Persian adventurer called Sa'adat Khan, originally from Khurasan in Persia.
The Najafi Dynasty of Nawabs of Bengal were Sayyids and were descendants of Prophet Muhammad through Al Imam Hasan ibn Ali, ruling from 1757 until 1880.
Rampur, former princely state of British India. Previously ruled by Shiite Muslim Nawabs of Rampur, it was incorporated into the state of Uttar Pradesh in 1949.
Population and circumstances.
India, the only non Muslim nation in the world with Shiite population of 3–4 percent of its entire population, has recognized the day of Ashura listed as Moharram as the Public Holiday in India. India also has the Birthday of Imam Ali as public Holiday in states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, whose capital Lucknow is considered as the centre of India’s Shiite Muslim community. The Birthdate of Ali is not recognized by any country in any of its states other than India and Iran as public Holiday. It is also a known fact that when Saddam mercilessly quelled a Shia uprising in 1992. The world media remained silent and damage to the shrines of Hussein ibn Ali and his half-brother Al-Abbas ibn Ali, in the course of Baathist attempts to flush out Shia rebels was a tightly kept secret of the Saddam regime but Indian media Doordarshan was the only network in the world to have shown that footage.
India being a secular country, Shiite Muslims in India practice their religion freely without any restriction. However, in post Godhra riots a Shia Ex Member of the Parliament Ehsan Jafri was reported to be burnt to death by Hindu mob in his own residence in the state of Gujarat in 2002.
Shias also claim to be sidelined in India, hence the All India Shia Personal Law Board was formed after segregation from the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in 2005 to address the legal needs of the Shia population. AISPLB feels that there should be a national policy for the Shias to prevent their exploitation by vested interests. The attitude of the government towards Muslims especially in Maharashtra came in for criticism. The newly formed All India Shia Personal Law Board had 69 members at the time of formation compared to 204 members in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.
The Shia body had the support of the erstwhile royal family of Lucknow, some 2000 descendants of the family claim to have extended their support. Shias claim they have been sidelined by the Sunni-dominated law board, which was set up in 1972.
Maulana Mirza Mohammed Athar, president of the breakaway All India Shia Personal Law Board explained the reason for segregation saying that, Shias have formed a forum of themselves because the All India Muslim Personal Law Board never took interest in their well being." Shias and Sunnis do not interpret family laws in a similar way. Shiites also have different Mosques and Burial grounds in India.
However, some external sources such as the BBC claim that there are close to 20 million Shia's in India and the Pew Research Center figure them between 10 to 14 percent giving the numbers between 16,000,000 to 24,000,000. However, the Pew Research Center report is not considered authentic by many Shias and also national and International reports after taking into consideration the report released by Britannica Book of the year in 1997 which put the estimates of Shia population in India in 1996 over 26,000,000 out of entire Indian Muslim population of 103,000,000 at that time.
Community.
There are notable Shia Muslims involved in many prominent Indian affairs, such as Arts, Business, Diplomates, Bureaucracrates, Journalism, Sports, Science, Religion, Literature, Politics, etc.
Azim Hashim Premji, being 3rd richest Indian, belongs to Shia community. Bismillah Khan, the winner of Bharat Ratna award is regarded as one of the most important figures in Indian music. In Politics, majority of Shia Muslims, like other Muslims of India are generally supporters of the Indian National Congress.
Some Shia organisations in India include:-
Azadari in India.
Azadari or the mourning practice of Imam Husain ibn Ali is very much prevalent across India. One thing which is worth noting in Indian Azadari is the participation of non Muslims in Shia rituals on the day of Ashura.
The Hindu rulers of Vijayanagar during the 16th and 17th centuries even donned blackened garments and helped to arrange the Kala Tazia (Black Tazia) processions. Even the Scindias of Gwalior and the Holkar Maharajas of Indore conducted Majlis or Muharram congregations. In Lucknow Hindus regularly join Muslims in the Azadari and Alam processions. The Sufi saints of India along with the Shi'ite Scholars encouraged the mixing and merging of indigenous elements from the rich cultural heritage of the land to that of Muharram thus proclaiming the message of peaceful co-existence among communities and united resistance to tyrannical authority.
The carrying of Alams through fire by men is more common. There are several occasions when these are traditionally practiced particularly in the town of Vizianagaram 550 km outside of Hyderabad where 110 Alams are taken through the fire. A significant aspect of firewalking in the context of Moharram commemorations in Andhra Pradesh is the participation of Hindus in the ceremonies. In Vizinagaram 109 of the Alams are carried by Hindus.

Yang Kunpeng began his professional football career playing for the Qingdao youth team before he eventually graduated to their senior team. While he initially broke into the senior team during the 1999 league season he struggled to gain a regular position within the following season team and failed to become a regular within first team. He would move to Bayi Football Team and under their Head coach Pei Encai he would revitalize his career and become a regular player within the team, however the 2003 league season saw the Bayi disbanded. He would follow his manager and join Wuhan Huanghelou and for the next four years was the starting center defender for the team. When Pei Encai left to take over the Chinese women's team tensions grew between the management and certain Shandong born players like Li Zhuangfei, Ren Yongshun, Guo Mingyue and Deng Xiaofei who believed that the management were mistreating them and purging them during the end of the 2007 league season. All these players would eventually leave the club and Yang was one of them when he decided to transferred back to his hometown in Qingdao in 2008.

James Edward Waite

James Edward Waite was a nineteenth-century blacksmith from East Stoughton (now Avon), whose tools are now on display at the Samuel Robbins 1820 Museum House in Avon, Massachusetts.
Born in 1843 in Bristol, England, he was one of 4 children of a laborer and scullery maid. As a young man of 7 he started learning the trade of blacksmithing. Alone at the age of 17 he took a ship to America, landing in Boston, MA. From there he went to Weymouth where he worked in a local blacksmith shopand met his wife. He finally moved to East Stoughton (now Avon, MA) where he opened a blacksmith shop near the center. The shops in this small section of crossroads between Brockton and Boston MA thrived as it was the main travel route between all the towns and cities to the south and Boston. The shops located here consisted of two grocers, OB Crane and Lorenzo Wade, two blackmsithing concerns S.W. Haley and Waite and Son*. John Holmes proprietor of the stables and Barlett Collisn carriage shop. When his son was born the shop became "Waite and Son Iron Shop". Mr. Waite as well as other founding fathers of East Stoughton were instrumental in starting the fight to leave the Stoughton Centre township and form their own town of what is now Avon.

Syledis

Syledis (SYstem LEger pour mesure le DIStance) was a terrestrial radio navigation and locating system. The system operated in the UHF segment of 420-450 MHz. It was manufactured in France by Sercel S.A. and was operational during the 1980s and until about 1995, providing positioning and navigational support for the petroleum sector in the North Sea and to other scientific projects. Syledis has been replaced by GPS.
Functioning.
Determination of the position of mobile vehicles, like f.e. vessels, using Syledis is accomplished by measurement of transit time of radio waves between mobiles and radio stations at known points. There are two modes of operation, "active range mode" and "passive pseudo-range mode".
Further explanation of the functioning of the Syledis positioning system.
A vessel is equipped with a transmitter that transmits a coded signal to at least three radio beacons each placed at a known point. The beacons send the code back to the transmitter. The returned coded signal is placed in a timeslot to determine the origin of the returned code. Therefore in an earlier stage a specified timeslot is connected to a specific beacon.
The elapsed time is proportional to twice the distance between the transmitter and the beacons. After the distance to the beacons is derived the position of the vessel can be calculated.

Viv Huzzey

Viv Huzzey (24 July 1876 - 29 August 1929) was a Welsh rugby union wing who played club rugby for Cardiff and won five caps for Wales. Huzzey was also an international British baseball player.
Rugby career.
Club career.
Huzzey was a fast wing with a strong scoring record, averaging around twenty tries a season. A popular player he worked well in partnership with Welsh rugby legend Gwyn Nicholls for both Cardiff and later for Wales. In 1900 at a general meeting for Cardiff Rugby Club, Nicholls and Huzzey were the only two names put forward for the position of captain for the next season. Nicholls had been the captain the previous two seasons, and Huzzey his vice, deputising well when Nicholls was absent. At the meeting Nicholls announced he was removing from contention to allow Huzzey the role, which caused the members to lobby Nicholls to change his mind in a very emotional charged situation. Nicholls did so and was re-elected. Huzzey felt betrayed by this move, as it was believed Huzzey would have otherwise been selected. Huzzey took umbrage and in September 'Went North', joining rugby league side Oldham RLFC.
International career.
Huzzey gained his first international cap against Ireland on 18 March 1898 at Limerick under the captaincy of Billy Bancroft. This was Wales's first match after their exile caused by the Gould Affair, but the team had not lost form and beat Ireland 11-3, with Huzzey scoring one of two tries. He was back for Wales against England on 2 April and although Wales lost, Huzzey played well scoring all the Welsh points with a try and a drop goal. Huzzey was back the next season in the 1899 Home Nations Championship and in the first game against England at St Helens, Wales were rampant; Willie Llewellyn scored four tries on his debut, and Huzzey scoring two tries himself. Huzzey's last two international matches against Ireland and Scotland saw him on the losing side. It is unknown if Huzzey would have won further caps as his decision to switch to the professional game of rugby league made him ineligible for further selection.
International matches played.
Wales
Baseball.
In 1908 Huzzey turned out for Wales in the first international British baseball match, contested between Wales and England. The game was played at the Harlequins Ground in Cardiff, Wales winning 122-114. In the Welsh team on that day were two other Cardiff RFC players, Jack ‘Buzzer’ Heaven and Charlie Spackman.

Odorannus

Odorannus of Sens (c. 985-1046) was a Benedictine monk at the abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif in Sens, France. He was, in varying capacities, an artist, architect, goldsmith, musical theorist, biographer, exegete and chronicler.
Life.
Virtually all that is known of Odorannus is the information he himself provides in his work. He was given an extensive education, apparently under the auspices of the abbot Rainard of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif (979-1015), who revitalized the monastery with learning. When Odorannus was about thirty years old, the Capetian King Robert the Pious of France (r. 996-1031) commissioned him to create a great reliquary to house the remains of Saint Savinianus, the first bishop of Sens. Odorannus' "Chronicle" describes in detail the interesting circumstances of this commission.
Under the year 1023 in his Chronicle, Odorannus refers to his being sent away from Saint-Pierre-le-Vif for a time, staying instead at the well-known abbey of Saint Denis. He returned after this time away. The reasons he gives for this banishment are unclear, but it seems there was some difficulty with his relationship with his fellow monks. Odorannus died at Saint-Pierre-le-Vif in 1046 after having finished the corpus of his works in 1045.
Works.
Odorannus' modern editors (see below) have categorized his works as follows:
Historical works.
These include the "Life of Theodochilda" (Chapter 1), the alleged daughter of the Merovingian king Clovis, said to have founded Saint-Pierre-le-Vif, and the "Chronicle" (Chapter 2), spanning the years 675 to 1032.
Canonical consultations.
These are the chapters of his compilation which deal with canon law, including a letter to the abbot William of Saint Denis (Chapter 3), a letter to the archbishop Gilduin (Chapter 10), a proclamation of archiepiscopal election for the city of Sens (Chapter 8), and a sermon to be read upon the ordination of Menard as archbishop of Sens (Chapter 9).
Theology and exegesis.
These include a letter to the priest Evrardus (Chapter 4) regarding the sin of Solomon and other theological issues, in which Odorannus cites the poet Prudentius extensively, a letter to the monk Arembertus on the work of Amalarius of Metz and on the biblical figure of the Sunamite (Chapter 7), and a letter to the clerics Ayfredus and Hugh regarding accusations of heresy (Chapter 13).
Pastoral care and liturgy.
These include an exhortation for fraternal concord, written by Odorannus on behalf of the abbot Ingo to monks previously under his care (Chapter 11), and a liturgical treatise, proposing prayers for the dead and visitation of the sick (Chapter 12).
Theory and practice of music.
These include a tonary (Chapter 5), and a description of how to construct a monochord (Chapter 6). Both are in the form of letters to other monks.

<doc id="19511355" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19511355" title="Crankcase heater">
Crankcase heater

A crankcase heater is an electrical component in a compressor in an air-conditioning system, heat pump system, or chiller system. The crankcase heater is normally on all the time, even when the unit is not running, though temperature sensors and set points may turn it off when not needed. A crankcase heater's sole purpose is to prevent refrigerant migration and mixing with crankcase oil when the unit is off, and to prevent condensation of refrigerant in the crankcase of a compressor. The crankcase heater keeps refrigerant at a temperature higher than the coldest part of the system. A crankcase heater generally has the same electrical symbol as a resistor because it converts electricity directly into heat via electrical resistance. The resistance in the heater coil determines the heat it produces when voltage is applied.
Installation.
Some air conditioning equipment manufacturers install crankcase heaters either in the compressor (insertion type), or mount them externally around the base of the compressor (bellyband type). The two wires of the heater are wired directly to the input side of the contact from the main power supply, and power is always supplied to the heater. Caution should be used since the heater can become very hot and cause second degree burns as well as cause electrical danger due to live circuits.
Start-up.
Most manufacturers of air conditioning require that the heater be energized for 24 hours before system start-up. The compressor must have crankcase heat before start-up or damage occurs to the compressor. The crankcase pressure of the compressor always drops when the compressor starts to turn.
Operation.
While the system is running, there is enough heat being generated by the compressor running to prevent refrigerant migration from occurring. Refrigerant vapor always migrates to the coldest part of the system (the compressor). The refrigerant migrates to the compressor crankcase where it is attracted to the compressor oil. This refrigerant vapor condenses and returns to a liquid in the off cycle. On the next start of the compressor, the oil is in a watery state and washes the bearings out, which leads to locked-up, frozen or totally burnt-out compressors. The temperature is sensed at the compressor, indoor coil, and outdoors. The sensed temperatures are compared and if the compressor temperature is not a specified amount higher than the lower of the other two sensed temperatures, then the crankcase heater is energized. When the compressor temperature rises to or is a specified amount above the lower of the other two temperatures, the crankcase heater is de-energized.
Crankcase heat is common in air conditioning (cooling) systems where R-22 has been used for many years. The home owner often shuts off the disconnect to the outdoor condensing unit for the winter, leaving the compressor without crankcase heat. If the homeowner then starts the unit without some time for the heat to boil the refrigerant out the oil, damage likely occurs to the compressor. On start-up, the crankcase pressure reduces as soon as the compressor starts to turn. The refrigerant boils and turn the oil to foam. The oil and refrigerant (some of the refrigerant may be in liquid state) is pumped out of the compressor. Valve and bearing damage may occur and the compressor may be operated with a limited oil charge until it returns to the crankcase from the evaporator.
Refrigeration compressors typically operate all seasons and do not have this seasonal shutdown, but if they are shut down for a period of time, the preceding situation occurs, so it is likely that crankcase heat will become popular.

Council Crest Park

Council Crest Park is a city park in southwest Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Amenities include paved and unpaved paths, a dog off-leash area, picnic tables, public art, a vista point, and a wedding site that can be reserved. The park, operated by Portland Parks & Recreation, is open year-round from 5 a.m. to midnight. It was the site of an amusement park from 1907 until 1929.
Description and history.
At above sea level, Council Crest is the highest point in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) that run parallel to the Willamette River in Portland. The hill was part of a donation land claim by John B. Talbot and was first known as "Talbot Mountain". Later, the hill became known as "Glass Hill" and then "Fairmount", the name of a road that encircles it. In 1898, delegates to the Triennial National Council of Congregational Churches met on the hill and decided to name it "Council Crest". A later assertion that Native Americans held councils on the summit remains unsupported by evidence.
One of the streetcars which had served the line, car 506, was on static display at Council Crest Park for more than 20 years, from November 1950 until 1972, when it was removed after being damaged by vandals. It was later acquired by the Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society and is preserved at that group's museum. The former streetcar line is also memorialized by replica-vintage streetcars which provided the Portland Vintage Trolley heritage service from 1991 to 2013, and on the Willamette Shore Trolley line starting in 2014. The ends of these cars display the same slogan as was displayed by the streetcars serving the Council Crest line: "See Portland from Council Crest". 
Although the observation tower erected in 1907 was dismantled in 1941, the city later built an observation area in the park from which it is possible to see Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount Jefferson in the Cascade Range.

Doncaster Gate Hospital Rotherham

Doncaster Gate Hospital was located in Rotherham, in South Yorkshire, England. The hospital was opened in 1869, as the first hospital in the town.
History.
Doncaster Gate Hospital Rotherham was originally known as the Rotherham Hospital and Dispensary from 1872 to 1948, it later became the Doncaster Gate Hospital. There had been a dispensary in Rotherham since 1806. This was initially situated on "Wellgate" before a new dispensary was built on College Street in 1828. Forty five years later this institution along with its finances was incorporated into the new hospital at "Doncaster Gate". 
Architecture.
Its mock Tudor/Gothic architecture was the winning design from among over ninety entries in a competition run by The Builder magazine in 1869. The architects were "Mallison & Bakewell" of Dewsbury and Leeds. Notable for its beauty and elegance the factory owner and local historian, John Guest, was moved to describe the building as ‘this noble edifice’ when officiating at the opening ceremony. 
Funding.
Opened to patients in 1872 it was the first purpose built hospital in the town. At the cost of just over £9,000 it was only able to be erected and maintained as a result of subscriptions donated by every section of the community - encompassing ladies living on "Moorgate" to the workers in the surrounding factories.
Name.
It might appear strange that the main hospital in Rotherham for over a century. carries the name of a neighbouring town. When it was finally agreed that a hospital was desperately needed it was decided to situate the new building in Doncaster Gate, so-named because historically it marks the major gateway leaving Rotherham and linking the town's "High Street" to "Doncaster Road" in a north easterly direction..

Red Giant (foaled February 28, 2004 in Kentucky) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse who in September 2008 set a world record for 1¼ miles on Turf.
Trained by Todd Pletcher, at Colonial Downs in New Kent County, Virginia, Red Giant notably won the July 21, 2007 Virginia Derby in course record time. He suffered an ankle injury in early October that kept him out of racing until August 2008. He returned to win the Fourstardave Handicap on Turf at Saratoga Race Course under jockey John Velazquez. He was then sent to Santa Anita Park in California where Velazquez rode him to victory in the Grade I Clement L. Hirsch Turf Championship Stakes in a world record time of 1:57.16 for 1¼ miles on Turf.
Offspring.
In January 2009, Red Giant was retired from racing to stand at stud at Hill 'n' Dale Farms in Lexington, Kentucky.
The first reported foal for Red Giant was a filly out of Carolyn Frances (by Personal Flag) born on January 30, 2010 at Clear Creek Stud in Louisiana. The second foal was a colt out of Brazilian (by Stravinsky) born on February 2, 2010 at Taylor Made Farm in Midway, Kentucky.

Harold Lee Tichenor

Harold Tichenor (born January 17, 1946 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is a Canadian multi-award winning film producer and writer and an adherent of the Baha'i Faith.
Biography.
From an early age, Harold Tichenor along with his brother Jim, developed an avid interest in filmmaking. Their grandfather Archie Tichenor had made films and audio visual programs for the US Baha'i community and their uncle Allen Tichenor worked as a camera technician in NYC. 
Raised in Philadelphia, Harold was fourteen years old in 1960 when he and his older brother started making films. In 1962 he joined The Film-Makers' Cooperative as its youngest member. Never expecting that a career in film was a realistic possibility, in the early 1960s, Tichenor held a number of jobs working as a land surveyor, piano technician, dairy herdsman, fish hatcheryman, draftsman and punch press operator. He attended the Walter Biddle Saul High School for Agricultural Sciences intending to pursue studies in the biological sciences in college. But in 1963 while enrolled in the ecology program at the University of Alaska, he found his first paying job in film working as the State of Alaska film librarian and as a cameraman for the University and its Geophysical Institute making documentary and educational films. At the same time he worked as the director of the University of Alaska Film Group programming a series of classic and foreign films.
In those years Canada was the foremost documentary film producing country in the world and in 1966 Tichenor decided to immigrate in order to further his career in non-fiction production. Initially, he worked as a freelance cameraman for CBUT Vancouver and in 1967 he moved to Alberta to help establish the media division of the newly formed University of Lethbridge. Over the next five years he produced a variety of science and educational documentaries for the University. In 1970-1, he served as research assistant to John Grierson [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340961/] when the noted social documentarian was guest professor at the University. In 1972, Tichenor completed his Bachelor’s degree in Drama and Art specializing in Film History and in 1974, after a year working as a writer/producer in Ottawa for the Public Service Commission’s Bureau of Staff Development and Training, he moved back to Alberta to continue his film career in the private sector.
In 1969, Tichenor had established his own film production company and until 1982 he worked on over 100 documentaries and educational films as a cameraman, editor, writer, producer and director. His one-hour documentary, Inupiatun [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080930/], won numerous awards, including a prestigious Rockie Award at the first Banff Television Festival and remains one of the definitive social studies of Inuit life and culture.
In 1980 Tichenor shifted his emphasis from documentary to dramatic production, initially working as a production manager on half a dozen television movies, series and several feature films. In the mid 1980s, he began working as a producer running the last two seasons of Danger Bay [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086692/] for CBC Television and the Disney Channel. In 1990 he and his partners formed Vancouver-based Crescent Entertainment and through that company produced programs and features for Viacom, ABC Television, Lifetime, CBC, CBS Television, Republic Pictures, and Warner Bros.. In order to focus on his work as a writer, in 2003 Tichenor retired from active production and the management of Crescent Entertainment Ltd. 
Tichenor has written for film and television and has published two non-fiction books on the Point blanket in the Fur Trade history, as well as numerous articles on film history and the business of film. He has taught film production at the University of Lethbridge and the Vancouver Film School and has guest lectured at the University of British Columbia, the University of Victoria, and Capilano College. In 1974 he was one of the founding members of the Alberta Motion Picture Industry Association serving on its board of directors until 1979. In addition, from 1976-9 he served on the board of the Lethbridge Public Library and in 1978-9 he was Vice President of the Alberta Library Trustees Association. During the 1980s, he served on several Canada Council juries, was chair of the BC District Council of the Directors Guild of Canada, served for two years on the national board of the DGC, several terms on the board of the British Columbia Motion Picture Association, and in the 1990s he served on the national board of the Canadian Film and Television Producers’ Association. During the late 1990s he was lead Canadian negotiator representing the CFTPA in British Columbia’s industry-wide labour negotiations. From 2000-2004 Tichenor served on the Board of Directors of the Banff Television Festival and in 2008 completed the final year of his second term as a member of the Board of Governors of that Festival.
Although several early films made by Tichenor are available through The Film-Makers' Cooperative in New York City, the majority of his films were made during the past forty years in Canada. The masters of these films are archived at the Archives of the Province of Alberta, the Gatineau Preservation Centre of Archives Canada and the National Film Board of Canada.
