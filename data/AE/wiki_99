Arthur Henry Mann

Arthur Henry Mann (16 May 1850, Norwich – 19 November 1929, Cambridge) was an English organist and composer of hymn tunes including "Angel's Story" which was originally written for the hymn 'I love to hear the story', but is also sung to the words 'O Jesus, I have promised.' He was most noted for his role as organist and director of music at King's College Chapel, Cambridge from 1876–1929, being the founder director of the world famous tradition of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols since its first performance in 1918. In 1888, he published his own edition of Thomas Tallis's Spem in alium. His edition, though flawed, was the very first publication ever made of Tallis's famous motet in forty parts.
Education.
Mann graduated from New College, Oxford (MusB 1874, MusD 1882). He was a chorister and assistant organist at Norwich Cathedral. He was an articled pupil to Zechariah Buck.

Mary Josephine Ray

Mary Josephine Ray (née Arsenault; May 17, 1895 – March 7, 2010) was a Canadian American Supercentenarian. At the time of her death, she was the world's second-oldest verified living person. Following the death of Gertrude Baines on September 11, 2009, Ray became the oldest person living in the United States.
She was the oldest recorded person ever to live in New Hampshire, although the oldest person born in New Hampshire was Nellie Spencer (1869–1982), who lived to age 113 years 81 days. Ray was also the oldest person ever recorded born in Prince Edward Island and the third-oldest person ever born in Canada. She was also ranked as one of the 35 oldest verified people in history. 
History.
Born in Bloomfield, Prince Edward Island to French Canadian (Acadian) parents, Sabin Arsenault and Lydie Anne Blanchard, Mary Josephine moved to the United States at age three. Her father died when she was 7 and her mother also died when she was 15. Mary went out on her own, working in factories in Maine. In the 1920s she married Walter Ray (died 1967), and moved to New Hampshire. She retired to Florida, aged 80, and lived there on her own until age 100, when her family brought her back to New Hampshire. At age 102, she moved into a nursing home when the family felt they could no longer care for her at home. 
Family.
Arsenault married Walter Ray circa 1923. The 1930 census listing for Walter Ray lists him as age 36, married at 28; and Mary Josephine as age 34 (it was in April), married at 27. Ray had two sons, both living: Robert, 86, of Pensacola, Florida and Donald, 85, of Hinsdale, New Hampshire. In all, she had two sons, eight grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren, and six great-great-grandchildren.
Hobbies.
Ray followed, as much as possible, the Boston Red Sox baseball team. After watching baseball games, she often had cake and ice cream. At her 108th birthday celebration, she was greeted with the song "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" and a cake with the Red Sox symbol on it. Ray continued to buy Red Sox merchandise, and commented that she intended to continue doing so. Fred Hale, who lived to be 113 years 354 days old, was also a fan of the team.

Collapsing sequence

A collapsing sequence occurs in human speech when utterance pairs between speakers have some unspoken thought occurring between them that may make the latter phrase, out of context, seem to have no logical connection to the former; there is, however, an implication that logical thought has occurred between the two phrases, so that the latter phrase will make sense based upon an assumption of its relation to the former.
Examples.
Customer: "What's chocolate filbert?"
The clerk's reply is in response to what he knows will come next in the discourse. If the clerk had proceeded to explain what chocolate filbert is, then it is possible that the customer would have asked for some. By explaining what the product is, the clerk would have tacitly implied that he had some to sell. Describing a product in a selling situation is often an implication that it is available. A waiter, for example, would not launch into a detailed description of a particular dish that a customer is inquiring about, only to end the discourse by then informing the customer that the dish is not available.
Another common collapsing sequence is illustrated below:
A. "Do you smoke?"
B. "I left them in my other jacket."
This type of collapsing sequence speeds up social interaction by averting unnecessary explanations.
Collapsing sequences can be used in other situations as well, such as when someone joins a discussion already in progress:
"Hi, John. We were just talking about nursery schools."
In the phrasing of this response, the speaker is either warning John not join the group, or is giving him orientation so that he can understand the context of the discussion and participate.

The Para Foliage-gleaner ("Automolus paraensis") is a species of bird in the Furnariidae family. It is found in humid forests in the south-eastern Amazon Basin in Brazil, being restricted to the regions east of the Madeira River and south of the Amazon River. Until recently, it was considered a subspecies of the Olive-backed Foliage-gleaner, and the morphology of the two is very similar, but their voices differ significantly.

Oros of Alexandria

Oros (Ὤρος) was a late classical/Byzantine lexicographer and grammarian active in the mid-5th century. According to the Suda he was born in Alexandria and taught in Constantinople. The "Suda" lists ten titles by him, but little of his work survives. 
Fragments of his lexicon of Attic usages are preserved in later lexica. This work sought to counter the hyperatticist doctrine favoured by some contemporary lexicographers, who were inspired by the works of the 2nd-century grammarian Phrynichus. Oros' work was influential in the later Byzantine lexicographical tradition. 
The "codex Messinensis graecus" 118 contains a fragment of a work on orthography concerning the use of the iota subscript. This is sometimes styled the "Lexicon Messanense". 
Fragments of two other works survive, one a list of words with more than one meaning, the other a list of toponyms and their supposed etymologies.

Soviet Union–Vanuatu relations

The Republic of Vanuatu and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics established official diplomatic relations on June 30, 1986 - three months to the day before Vanuatu established diplomatic relations with the United States.
Overview.
Vanuatu, which became independent from France and the United Kingdom in 1980, was led by Prime Minister Father Walter Lini, founder of the doctrine of Melanesian socialism, from 1980 to 1991. Lini's foreign policy was one of non-alignment, manifested by Vanuatu joining the Non-Aligned Movement in 1983. His government was the only one in Oceania at the time which refused to align with the Western bloc during the dying stages of the Cold War. Lini sought to maintain cordial, though not particularly close, relations with the Soviet Union. There was never any suggestion of Vanuatu aligning with the Eastern bloc; Lini was not a Marxist, and there was no Communist Party in Vanuatu.
In 1987, Vanuatu authorised Soviet vessels to fish within Vanuatu's Exclusive Economic Zone, in exchange for economic aid. The agreement lapsed the following year, and was not renewed, due to disagreements over the price to be paid for fishing rights by the USSR.
The year 1991 was marked both by the end of Lini's last term in office and by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thereafter, relations between Port-Vila and Moscow were virtually non-existent.

Adaptive switching

An adaptive switch is designed to operate in cut-through mode (cut-through switching) normally but if a port's error rate jumps too high, the switch automatically reconfigures the port to run in store-and-forward mode
This optimizes the switch's performance by providing higher speed cut-through switching switching if error rates are low but higher throughput store and forward switching if error rates are high.
Adaptive switching is typically done on a port-by-port basis.

Results of the Canadian federal election, 2008

The 40th Canadian federal election was held on October 14, 2008.
The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Stephen Harper, won a minority government. The Conservatives won 143 seats. The Liberal Party of Canada, won 77 seats. The separatist Bloc Québécois won 49 seats and the social-democratic New Democratic Party won 37. Two independent candidates won a seat, one each in Nova Scotia and Quebec.

Vote and seat summaries.
<br>
Gains, holds and losses.
All four parties in the House gained at least one riding at the expense of other parties, and all of these parties also had at least one of their incumbents defeated. A total of 40 ridings (13.0%) switched parties in the election. The first table below summarizes the number of gains, holds and losses for each of the four parties, plus independents. The numbers in the second table indicate the number of seats gained by each party in listed in the left hand column from each party listed in the top row.
For each constituency, the result of the 2008 election is compared either with the 2006 federal election, or with the result of its by-election in seats for which one was held during the 39th Parliament. The effects of floor crossings are not considered - results in ridings where the incumbent crossed the floor are tallied as "gains" where the incumbent was re-elected for his new party and as "holds" where the incumbent's former party re-took the seat. To further clarify, David Emerson's former seat of Vancouver Kingsway is scored as an NDP gain from the Liberals and is not included in any part of the Conservatives' tally. Seats that were vacant at dissolution are also considered as being held by the last party elected in the district.
Atlantic provinces.
The Liberals won 17 seats in the Atlantic Provinces, the Conservatives ten, the NDP four, and Independent one. This is a swing of 1 seat from the Liberals to each of the other parties.
Newfoundland and Labrador.
Buoyed by the so-called "ABC Campaign", spearheaded by popular Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams, the Liberals won six seats and the NDP one. The Avalon and St. John's South—Mount Pearl seats changed hands from the Tories to the Liberals. The St. John's East seat changed from the Tories to NDP, as Norman Doyle retired. The change in Avalon was a crushing blow as the incumbent Fabian Manning was soundly defeated by the Liberals' Scott Andrews.
Prince Edward Island.
The three Liberal incumbents have been re-elected. In the fourth riding, Egmont, incumbent Liberal Joe McGuire retired, and the seat went to the Tories.
Nova Scotia.
All incumbents were re-elected, except in Halifax where the retiring Alexa McDonough was replaced by another New Democrat, Megan Leslie, and in West Nova the incumbent Liberal Robert Thibault was defeated by Tory Greg Kerr. Elizabeth May of the Green Party was defeated in the riding of Central Nova, which was a battle between her and incumbent cabinet minister Peter MacKay.
New Brunswick.
The Liberal Green Shift was most unpopular in New Brunswick. Three ridings previously held by the Liberals switched to the Tories; Fredericton, Miramichi, and Saint John. In the other seven ridings the incumbent was re-elected.
Quebec.
The Bloc Québécois played obstruction in preventing the Conservatives from achieving a majority. Fifteen battleground ridings were in Quebec, with only three changing hands. The BQ lost the riding of Papineau to the Liberals, but gained the riding of Louis-Hébert from the Tories. A recent recount saw the Liberals take the riding of Brossard—La Prairie from the BQ, slightly strengthening their position.
Ontario.
Twenty battleground ridings were in Ontario alone, and the Conservatives took the ridings of Brant, Oakville, Huron—Bruce and Halton from the Liberals, where the NDP took Thunder Bay—Superior North, Thunder Bay—Rainy River, Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, Sudbury and Nickel Belt from the Liberals. The Liberals themselves lost 16 seats in Ontario.
Prairie provinces.
Saskatchewan.
All seats were retained by their incumbent parties. The closest race was Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. There, the incumbent Carol Skelton did not seek reelection, giving the NDP high hopes that well-known farmers' activist Nettie Wiebe might re-establish a federal NDP presence in Parliament from the province. The seat was retained by Conservative Kelly Block in a close two-way race to keep the NDP shut out in Saskatchewan - despite the fact that their proportion of the popular vote there was in fact higher than any other province outside Atlantic Canada.
Alberta.
Arguably the Conservatives' power base, Alberta's Tory incumbents were all re-elected except for the riding of Edmonton—Strathcona, which the NDP narrowly took that riding with 442 votes.
British Columbia.
The Conservatives regained the seats lost in the 2006 election and held on to seven of the ten battleground ridings. They took the ridings of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country from the Greens and Richmond from the Liberals.
Territories.
Liberal candidate in the Yukon and the NDP candidate in Western Arctic (the Northwest Territories) won re-election.
However, in Nunavut the Liberal candidate Kirt Ejesiak was defeated by Conservative Leona Aglukkaq to give the modern Conservatives their first elected member from the territories.
Popular vote by province.
Voter turnout.
Voter turnout was the lowest in Canadian election history, as 59.1% of the electorate cast a ballot. All federally funded parties except for the Greens attracted fewer total votes than in 2006; the Greens received nearly 280,000 more votes this election. The Conservatives lost 167,494 votes, the Liberals 850,000, the Bloc 200,000 and the NDP 70,000.

Patrick Ness

Patrick Ness (born October 17, 1971) is an American-born British author, journalist and lecturer who lives in London and holds dual citizenship. He is best known for his books for young adults, including the Chaos Walking trilogy and A Monster Calls.
Ness won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians both in 2011 and in 2012, for "Monsters of Men" and "A Monster Calls", recognising each as the best new book for children or young adults published in the U.K.
He is one of seven writers to win two Medals (no one has won three) and the second to win consecutively.
Biography.
Patrick Ness was born in the U.S. on Fort Belvoir army base, near Alexandria, Virginia, where his father was a drill sergeant in the US Army. They moved to Hawaii, where he lived until he was six, then spent the next ten years in Washington state, before moving to Los Angeles. Ness studied English Literature at the University of Southern California.
After graduating, he worked as corporate writer for a cable company. He published his first story in "Genre" magazine in 1997 and was working on his first novel when he moved to London in 1999.
Ness was naturalised a British citizen in 2005. He entered into a civil partnership with his partner in 2006, less than two months after the Civil Partnership Act came into force.
Ness taught creative writing at Oxford University and has written and reviewed for "The Daily Telegraph", "The Times Literary Supplement", "The Sunday Telegraph" and "The Guardian". He reviews for "The Guardian" .
He has been a Fellow of the Royal Literary Fund and was the first Writer in Residence for Booktrust.
Walker Books has published all four children's novels by Ness to date, one annually from 2008 to 2011. According to news coverage, "He turned to children's fiction after he had the idea for a world where it is impossible to escape information overload, and knew it was right for teenagers."
The first was "The Knife of Never Letting Go", and it won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers.
"The Ask and the Answer" and "Monsters of Men" were sequels to "The Knife"; jointly they are called the "Chaos Walking trilogy" and "The Knife" has been reissued with a front cover banner "Chaos Walking: Book One". Ness has also published three short stories in the "Chaos Walking" universe, the prequels "The New World" and "The Wide, Wide Sea", and "Snowscape", set after the events of "Monsters of Men". The short stories are available as free-to-download e-books, and have been included in the 2013 UK print editions of the novels.
"A Monster Calls" (2011) originated with Siobhan Dowd, another writer with the same editor at Walker, Denise Johnstone-Burt. Before her August 2007 death, Dowd and Johnstone-Burt had discussed the story and contracted for Dowd to write it. Afterward, Walker arranged separately with Ness to write and Jim Kay to illustrate, and those two completed the book without meeting. Ness won the Carnegie and Kay won the companion CILIP Kate Greenaway Medal (established 1955), the first time one book has won both medals.
On 7 May 2013, he was revealed to be the author of "Tip of the Tongue", the May e-short featuring the Fifth Doctor and Nyssa as part Puffin's eleven "Doctor Who" e-shorts in honor of the show's 50th anniversary.
His next book, "More Than This" was released on 5 September 2013.
Awards.
"The Knife of Never Letting Go" won numerous awards including the Booktrust Teenage Prize, the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, and the 2008 Tiptree Award. It was shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal. "The Ask and the Answer" won the 2009 Costa Book Award in the children's book category. It, too, made the Carnegie shortlist. "Monsters of Men" won the CILIP Carnegie Medal and was shortlisted for the 2011 Arthur C. Clarke Award.

Maynard (Surrey cricketer)

Maynard (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played for Surrey during the 1740s.
Career.
Maynard is mentioned in reports from 1744 to 1750. He was especially prolific in 1748 when he took part in a number of single wicket matches.
On Saturday, 2 June 1744, he played for London against Slindon in the earliest match that has a surviving scorecard. He is not mentioned again until 1747 but it is assumed that he remained active in the interim. In 1747, he played for All-England versus Kent at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 31 August.
The 1748 season was the zenith of single wicket and Maynard, who must have been an adept at this form of cricket, is mentioned in the reports of five matches. 
The last two mentions of Maynard are in first-class matches for Surrey when he played against Kent at Dartford Brent in June 1749 and again in July 1750.
As Maynard had established his reputation by 1744, he must have been active for some years previously. His career possibly began in the 1730s and continued into the 1750s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports.

Soviet Union–Tonga relations

Tonga and the Soviet Union established formal diplomatic relations in 1976. Tonga was the first Pacific Island country to establish relations with the USSR.
Overview.
Tongan-Soviet relations may be viewed in the context of the two countries' interests. In the mid-1970s, the entirety of Oceania was firmly aligned with the Western bloc in the context of the Cold War, and the Soviet Union, despite its eastern coast being on the Pacific Ocean, was excluded from participation in regional matters. Tonga, meanwhile, had recently regained full sovereignty after being a protectorate of the United Kingdom, and was establishing its own foreign policy. Aligning itself with the West, Tonga sought development aid from its Western partners.
Tonga's move to establish relations with the USSR immediately followed Australia's refusal to finance the modernisation and expansion of Fuaʻamotu International Airport, and was widely perceived in Australia as a means deployed by the Tongan government to pressure the West into increasing its aid to Tonga. The Australian government thereupon announced that it would finance the airport's upgrade after all and, in 1977, increased its overall economic aid to Tonga (from A$406,000 to over A$1,000,000), before opening a High Commission in Nukuʻalofa in 1980.
In 1987, Tonga "played the Soviet card" again (in the words of E. Huffer), when the then crown prince Sia'osi Taufa'ahau Manumata'ogo Tuku'aho Tupou paid a State visit to the Soviet Union, and declared while in Moscow that "Tonga and the Soviet Union are linked, not separated, by the Pacific Ocean", adding that "the USSR a Pacific nation with legitimate interests in the region".
Relations between Moscow and Nukuʻalofa remained pragmatic rather than ideological. Tonga was, at the time, a quasi-absolute monarchy, with no ideological sympathy for communism.

Bob Dechert

Robert "Bob" Dechert (born May 18, 1958) is a Canadian politician and lawyer. He represents the electoral district of Mississauga—Erindale in the House of Commons of Canada. He is a member of the Conservative Party.
Political history.
Dechert formed the "Blue Committee" in 1994. The Blue Committee was a group of provincial conservatives, primarily from Ontario, who desired a more conservative Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and wanted to work together with the Reform Party of Canada. The Blue Committee was instrumental in the creation of the United Alternative movement, the Canadian Alliance and ultimately, the Conservative Party of Canada. 
Dechert ran in the 2004 Canadian federal election in the electoral district of Mississauga—Erindale, losing to Carolyn Parrish. He ran in the same riding in the 2006 Canadian federal election, losing to Omar Alghabra.
He defeated Alghabra in the 2008 Canadian federal election to become the Member of Parliament for that riding. 
On March 5, 2010, Dechert became the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.
He won re-election, again defeating Alghabra in the 2011 Canadian federal election.
Relationship with Shi Rong.
On September 9, 2011, it was revealed that Dechert had been engaging in "flirtatious e-mails" with a correspondent, Shi Rong, working for the Peoples' Republic of China news agency, Xinhua. The e-mails came to light when the correspondent's husband hacked into her e-mail account and made them public. Dechert acknowledged the "flirtatious" nature of his relationship and issued an apology, but denied any wrongdoing.
Controversy revolved around the fact that Dechert was, at the time of the relationship, parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird. Critics, including Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat to Beijing, raised concerns as to whether Shi Rong was a Chinese spy trying to gain access sensitive government information. Both Burton and the opposition asserted that Dechert must have known about Xinhua's espionage activities.
Education and prior work history.
Dechert was born in Brampton, Ontario and graduated from McMaster University in Hamilton with a Bachelor of Arts in economics. He attended law school at the University of Toronto and was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1985.
He joined the law firm of Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP. He practiced corporate law and was a senior partner at the firm prior to his first election victory.

Women in the 40th Canadian Parliament

The 40th Canadian Parliament contained a record number of female Members of Parliament, with 69 women elected to the House of Commons in the 2008 federal election. However, this represented just 22 per cent of the 308 total MPs, and only a modest gain over the 65 women in the 39th Canadian Parliament.
With 23 women elected to the House for the first time, the 2008 election also increased the number of female MPs who have sat in the Canadian House of Commons since Confederation to 216, from 193 at the end of the 39th Parliament. Nine incumbent women MPs did not stand for re-election in 2008, and ten incumbent women were defeated on election night.
In total, 445 women ran in the 2008 election. The record for female participation in a federal election continues to be held by the 1993 election, in which 476 women ran as candidates, but the 2008 election had the second largest slate of female candidates in Canadian history.
By contrast, the United States House of Representatives has elected only a marginally larger number of women despite having 127 more seats. The 2008 Congressional elections saw 74 women elected to the House of Representatives, for an all-time total of 229.
At the dissolution of the 40th Parliament, the number of women sitting as federal MPs stood at 67, as two women elected in 2008 subsequently resigned from the House: Dawn Black on April 13, 2009 and Judy Wasylycia-Leis on April 30, 2010. Women did not win any of the by-elections to the 40th Canadian Parliament.
Party standings.
The 2008 election was the first time in Canadian electoral history that one of the major parties nominated more female candidates than the New Democrats or their predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.
Members.
The longest-serving female MP currently in the House of Commons is Albina Guarnieri, who was first elected in the 1988 election and surpassed 20 years in office in December 2008. In the 39th Parliament, Guarnieri was tied for this status with Diane Marleau, who was first elected in 1988 but was defeated in the 2008 election.

Kosovo–United Arab Emirates relations are foreign relations between the Republic of Kosovo and the United Arab Emirates.
Diplomatic Relations.
Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and the United Arab Emirates recognised it on 14 October 2008. Kosovo plans to open an embassy in the UAE. On 27 April 2010, the United Arab Emirates designated Khalid Khalifa Al-Mualla, who is the Emirati ambassador to Turkey, as its non-resident ambassador to Kosovo.
History.
After the Serbian government launched a major offensive against the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo in 1998, the UAE called for international intervention and commenced a major program of humanitarian relief through its Red Crescent Society. In 1999, the UAE was among the first non-NATO states to voice support for NATO's bombing campaign.
During the UN administration period, the UAE maintained almost 1,500 peacekeeping and special operations troops in Kosovo. The UAE was the only Muslim state to offer to participate in the Kosovo Force and its commitment was the first operational deployment of UAE forces outside the Middle East region. As of October 2008, these forces remained in Kosovo and between 1998 and 2008, the aid given to Kosovo by the UAE’s Red Crescent Authority alone cost Dh125 million, the biggest international humanitarian mission in the UAE's history.

Proprietary chapel

A proprietary chapel is a chapel that originally belonged to a private person. In 19th century Britain they were common, often being built to cope with urbanisation. Frequently they were set up by evangelical philanthropists with a vision of spreading Christianity in cities whose needs could no longer be met by the parishes. Some functioned more privately, with a wealthy person building a chapel so they could invite their favourite preachers. They are anomalies in English ecclesiastical law, having no parish area, but being able to have an Anglican clergyman licensed there. Historically many Anglican churches were proprietary chapels. Over the years they have often been converted into normal parishes.
"During the first half of the nineteenth century "proprietary" chapels flourished in Belgravia, Bath, and other fashionable resorts. They were extra-parochial, and were often run on a commercial basis, supported by pew-rents and sometimes built over wine vaults ... An ingratiating preacher, preferably an invalid ..., a well-nourished verger, and genteel pew-openers did their best to attract the quality ... An advertisement from the "Times" (1852) gives a good idea of the "ethos" of the proprietary chapel «A young man of family, evangelically disposed, and to whom salary is no object, may hear of a cure in a fashionable West End congregation by addressing the Reverend A.M.O. at Hatchards, Boosellers, Piccadilly.»"--Andrew L. Drummond "The Churches in English Fiction". Leicester: Edgar Backus, 1950; pp. 30-31.
Today there are still a number of Anglican churches which are proprietary chapels, including one in Avonwick in Devon; Christ Church, Bath; Emmanuel Church, Wimbledon St John's, Downshire Hill Hampstead [http://sjdh.org; and St James' Ryde on the Isle of Wight [http://www.stjamesryde.com]. St John's Chapel, Bedford Row was formerly proprietary.

Craig Watson (boxer)

Craig Watson (born 7 February 1983 in Oldham, Greater Manchester) is an English boxer who has fought in the light welterweight, welterweight and light middlweight divisions. He is a former British welterweight champion and has previously held the Commonwealth title at both welterweight and light middleweight.
Amateur boxing career.
Watson first gained TV exposure after taking on Amir Khan. Going into the bout as an unknown he was heavily written off by many as Khan was the Olympic silver medalist at the time however Watson managed to score a knock down and only lost on a close points defeat.
Professional boxing career.
Early professional career.
Watson had his first professional contest in May 2005 when he scored a 2nd round tko over Willie Valentine at the Elephant and Castle Centre in Southwark. He won his next six fights in a row before stepping up to fight fellow prospect John Fewkes (13-0) at the Leeds Town Hall. The fight gave Watson his first pro defeat as Fewkes scored a points victory over 8 rounds. Following that first loss Watson regrouped and scored wins over Robert Lloyd-Taylor (twice) and fellow prospect Michael Lomax. The victories set him up for a shot at the Commonwealth Welterweight title held by tough Namibian Ali Nuumbembe in a fight to be held on 8 December 2007 at the Robin Park Centre in Wigan.
Commonwealth welterweight champion.
Watson produced the performance of his career so far in Wigan, beating Nuumbembe to win the Commonwealth title when the fight was stopped in the 8th round. An early clash of heads had caused a cut above Nuumbembe's left eye which eventually got so bad that the corner could not stem the flow of blood and so handed Watson victory. The newly crowned champion then travelled to Italy for his next fight in order to contest the vacant European Union belt against unbeaten Italian Daniele Petrucci. The fight on 8 March 2008 ended in bitter disappointment for Watson when the referee stopped it in the 3rd round with Watson saying that he was neither "mentally or physically prepared" for the fight having taken the match at short notice.
Redemption came only a few months later on 24 May 2008 when Watson found himself sharing a ring with Matthew Hatton at the City of Manchester Stadium. The fight for Watson's Commonwealth title was on the undercard to Ricky Hatton's fight with Juan Lazcano in what was widely dubbed as the Hitman's homecoming following his defeat to Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas. Watson ended up winning the fight on points over 12 rounds prompting Hatton to say afterwards that Watson was the first man who had legitimately beaten him in the ring. On 11 April 2009 Watson lost the title in his second defence to John O'Donnell in a close fought contest at the York Hall to register the third defeat of his career. The contest shown live on ITV4 was described as scintillating as well as a 'classic bout' by observers sitting ringside.
Commonwealth light middleweight champion.
Watson rebounded from the defeat to O'Donnell with a points win over journeyman Matt Scriven 21 August 2009 and a second round stoppage of Swiss boxer Riad Menasria on 27 November 2009. Prior to the fight with Menasria, Watson had said that he was looking to compete at light welterweight in the future and wanted to meet reigning British champion Lenny Daws. On 19 February 2010 in his first fight of the new year, Watson travelled to Stoke and stopped former British title challenger |Barrie Jones in 4 rounds. His chance to regain a championship belt came just over one full year since his defeat to O'Donnell. Given just two days notice Watson stepped in to fight Ugandan boxer Badru Lusambya on 16 April 2010 for the light middleweight version of the Commonwealth belt. Despite having never fought at the higher weight before, Watson put his opponent down 4 times in the second round to win a convincing victory. Despite the victory and the title Watson chose to move back down to welterweight for his next contest on 16 July 2010 after deciding that light middleweight was perhaps not his ideal weight. His opponent, the Ghanain journeyman Stephen Okine was stopped in the fifth round on the undercard of a bill that saw former victim Matthew Hatton retain his European title with a victory over his mandatory challenger Yuriy Nuzhnenko. On 6 November 2010 Watson moved back up to light middleweight at the Castle Leisure Center in Bury to register a win against Romanian journeyman Vasile Surcica, putting him down in the 8th round but failing to stop him inside the distance and scoring an 8 round points win.
British welterweight champion.
Watson won the British title on 19 February 2011 with a revenge win against John O'Donnell, the man he had previously lost his old Commonwealth title to. Prior to the fight Watson referred to some of the pre-fight talk between the two fighters saying "He says he will shut me up, but it's all right saying that ... we'll see what happens in the ring". Watson said that following the close nature of the result against O'Donnell last time he had been consumed by bitterness and said that he was the victim of a home town decision as the fight took place in London, O'Donnells home. This time however there was to be no mistake. The return against O'Donnell once again took place in London, this time at the Wembley Arena, but the judges scored 116-113, 116-112 and 117-112 all to Watson over the 12 rounds. On 16 April 2011, in his first defence of the title, Watson lost to Lee Purdy. The fight, on the undercard of Amir Khan's contest with Paul McCloskey was stopped in the fifth round when Purdy caught Watson with a right hand to the jaw to win the British title. Watson attempted to retain the title on 16 July 2011 with a bout in his home town of Oldham but was once again stopped in the fifth as Purdy made a successful first defence.

The four-story red brick and sandstone building, located on a hilltop overlooking the city, is in the Romanesque Revival style and was designed by Twin Cities architects Omeyer and Thori, who also designed educational buildings at St. Olaf College, courthouses in Windom and Ada, and the E.J. Webber house and Ole Hagen's Autograph Block in Fergus Falls. Its construction, supervised by contractor John Lauritzen, required all of the brick masons available in the area. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. 
Construction of the red brick and sandstone building required all the brick masons that could be found in the area. Arched windows, gabled dormers and a pencil-point belfry accentuate the building's height. As the topography levels off west of the city, the college's hilltop location contributes a commanding appearance in Classicized Revival. 
Park Region Luther College operated on the site until 1932, when the synod decided to concentrate its academic efforts on Concordia College in Moorhead. Three years later, the campus was sold to the Church of the Lutheran Brethren, which operates Hillcrest Lutheran Academy.

Woerden railway station

Woerden railway station (Dutch: "Station Woerden") is the railway station of Woerden, the Netherlands. The railway station was opened on 21 May 1855 on the Utrecht–Rotterdam railway. In 1911 a new building was built in Jugendstil, that still exists. During 1993-1996 the railway station was modernised, replacing the wooden roof and stairways by modern ones. 
During the closing decades of the twentieth century growing numbers of stopping trains at the station and a sustained rise in the level of motorised traffic led to increasing delays both for cyclists and for motorists at the level crossing directly adjacent to the station on its western side. The matter was finally addressed early in the twenty-first century with the construction of a short section of road tunnel under the railway lines: this replaced the old level crossing.
The station has two platforms, and two entrances. On every entrance there is bicycle parking.

Khodori Institute, Tulkarm

Khodori Institute is an agricultural college located in Tulkarm, in the northern West Bank. The college was inaugurated in 1930 after the British Government had received a bequest from the Iraqi-born Jewish philanthropist Sir Ellis Kadoorie. The college was named in his honour and still bears his name. The Agricultural college came under the authority of the Government of the British Mandate and was supervised by the Department of Agriculture. In addition to the agricultural land the college included; cattle, sheep and chicken farms. The agricultural school played an important role in providing the Palestinian agricultural sector with technicians in various fields of agriculture. Due to the position of the 1948 Armistice line the college lost most of its agricultural land in the 1948 Arab Israeli war.
During the period of Jordanian administration, the agricultural school was transformed into Technical Agricultural Institute offering an associate degree (Diploma) in all agricultural sciences until 1967. After the 1967 Six day war the importance of the college to agriculture in the West Bank declined, with deterioration of the farm buildings. The college was then transformed from an Agricultural based Institute to a college with an industrial based emphasis.
At the beginning of the peace process and following the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), there was a rejuvenation of the agricultural aspect of the college, through both governmental and non-governmental funding. An Italian organization in cooperation with the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Land Research Centre (LRC) set about repairing the dilapidated cattle farm. This initiative also encompassed the establishment of an information and agricultural advisory centre.
The Khadouri family has funded the construction of a new science wing for the college.
In early 2007, the college was granted the status of a university. It was accrideted officially on 30 August 2007 as Palestine Technical University- Kadorie. This was announced officially by its Dean and acting president Dr. Mutasim Babaa' on September 1, 2007. Parts of Khodori College land is now affiliated to the An-Najah National University in Nablus. This part includes faculty of agriculture and faculty of Veteran. With a grant from the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees a pilot project for the design, construction and operation of a biogas digester was erected at Khadori College, Energy Research Centre (ERC) of An-Najah National University provided technical assistance, supervision and valuation of results.
Education under occupation.
The routine of the Khodori Institute has suffered under the Israeli occupation of the West Bank but the staff of the institute have adapted techniques to get around curfews enabling the Khodori Institute to produce a high grade of student despite the many interruptions.
Two agricultural institutes.
Khodori is one of two of agricultural schools founded as agricultural schools by the British during the Mandatory Palestine period with contributions from a bequest of the Iraqi-born Jewish philanthropist Sir Ellis Kadoorie, who died in the British colony of Hong Kong in 1922. Kadoorie contributed 1,000,000 British Pounds. However, when Kadoorie's testament was read it became clear that the Yishuv would not inherit the money - the government of Britain would - and that Kadoorie ordered in his testament to invest the money either in Palestine or in Iraq. Initially an agricultural school was built in Tulkarm. This opened in 1930 with an English principal; the school had the character of a British colonial institution. Soon after many institutions and leaders of the Yishuv made a petition to Herbert Samuel for the establishment of a Jewish school. The British authorities endorsed the idea of a Palestinian Jewish agricultural school similar to the Palestinian Arab school in Tulkarm. The foundations for the second school were laid down in 1931 at Um J’abal, next to the village of Kfar Tavor and the Jewish Kadoorie Agricultural High School was opened in 1933.

U937 cells are a model cell line used in biomedical research. They were isolated from the histiocytic lymphoma of a 37 year old male patient and are used to study the behaviour and differentiation of monocytes. U937 cells mature and differentiate in response to a number of soluble stimuli, adopting the morphology and characteristics of mature macrophages.
U937 cells are of the myeloid lineage and so secrete a large number of cytokines and chemokines either constitutively (e.g. IL-1 and GM-CSF) or in response to soluble stimuli. TNFα and recombinant GM-CSF independently promote IL-10 production in U937 cells.
U937 can be grown in DMEM or 1640 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum.
Atromentin induces apoptosis in human leukemia U937 cells.
The HLA alleles present in U937 cells are HLA-A*03:01, A*31:01, B*18:01, B*51:01, Cw*01:02 and Cw*07:02.

Gus Chambers

Gary Chambers (1956 – 13 October 2008), known as Gus Chambers, was a musician from Coventry, England. He was well known as lead vocalist of the groove metal band Grip Inc.
Life and career.
He took over vocals (from Terry Hall (singer) who left to form The Specials) in Coventry punk band The Squad (formed late 1977). They released their first single "Red Alert" in 1978. Terry Hall had helped pen several of the tracks on the first single (before he left).
After relocating to Los Angeles, Chambers formed band Sons of Domination. During summer 1993, Gus Chambers met Waldemar Sorychta, who along with former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo formed Grip Inc.. The band released four critically acclaimed groove metal albums.
Chambers' parents lived for a period of time in northern Nevada. As such, he visited the region periodically. After the Grip Inc. tour in support of Power of Inner Strength, Gus spent several months with new-found friends in Reno, Nevada (including a spontaneous performance with local band The Magic Nose Goblins (Pete Noble, Paul Richardson, Ty Hagar, and Joe Sands) at the famed "Moon Rocks".
It was during this time that Chambers enlisted the services of Pete Noble (bass), Romney Ruppel (guitar), and Scott Loring (drums) to revisit and re-record some of The Squad's classics. A four-song EP was produced. Shortly thereafter, Gus was recalled to Los Angeles to work on the second Grip Inc. album.
Following the Grip Inc. release of "Solidify", Chambers returned to Reno. Reuniting with Pete Noble, he joined Jeff Dunn, Kevin Kolstad, and Ian Anderson in a new project entitled Kill Kelly. Gus was instrumental in helping to form the initial sounds of Kill Kelly, although he was called back to Germany to fulfill contractual obligations to produce a fourth Grip Inc. album ("Incorporated"). In fact, many of the songs on "Incorporated" had been slated to be recorded with Kill Kelly.
Because of the lack of Grip's touring, Chambers formed punk-rock band Squad 21, based in Dortmund, Germany, releasing an album. The band's name is a play of The Squad and 21 Guns, where Chambers played during his early career. Later, he joined German power metal band Squealer and released one album under moniker Squealer A.D. in 2006. Later, he played in Coventry-based punk-rock band Mantra Sect.
Death.
Gus Chambers was found dead on 13 October 2008. Initial reports indicated suicide, but an official inquisition report proved it was accidental death because of mixture of his medication and alcohol.
On 27 October 2009, over a year after Gus Chambers' death, his son Nolan Gary Chambers, committed suicide at his mother's home in American Fork, Utah. Nolan was 25 years old.

Chernoe Znamia

Chernoe Znamia (or Chornoe Znamia) (, ), known as the Chernoznamentsy, was a Russian anarchist communist organisation. It emerged in 1903 as a federation of cadres. It took its name – "The Black Banner" – from the black flag, the use of which as a symbol of anarchism in Russia, according to "An Anarchist FAQ", coincided with its founding.
Composition.
The largest collection of anarchist terrorists in Imperial Russia, "Chernoe Znamia" attracted its strongest following in the western and southern provinces at the frontier of the Empire, including nearly all anarchists in Białystok. Their ranks included mostly students, factory workers and artisans, though there were also peasants, unemployed labourers, drifters, and self-professed Nietzschean supermen. Ethnically, Jews predominated, and many members were of Ukrainian, Polish and Great Russian nationality. The typical age of the "Chernoznamentsy" was nineteen or twenty, and some of the most active adherents were as young as fifteen years old.
Tactics and ideology.
With a history marked, in the words of historian Paul Avrich, by "reckless fanaticism and uninterrupted violence", the "Chernoznamensty" were the first anarchist group with a deliberate policy of terror against the established order. They saw merit in every act of propaganda by the deed, no matter how intemperate and senseless it appeared to the public, as evoking the lust of the underclass for vengeance against their tormentors. Along with the equally fanatical "Beznachalie" ("Without Authority"), "Chernoe Znamia" was the most conspicuous anarchist communist organisation in Russia.

Egregia menziesii is a species of kelp known commonly as feather boa kelp. It is native to the coastline of western North America from Alaska to Baja California, where it is a common kelp of the intertidal zone. It is dark brown in color, shiny and bumpy in texture, and may reach over five meters long. It grows a branching stipe from a thick holdfast. It bears long, flat, straplike fronds lined with small blades each a few centimeters long. There are pneumatocysts at intervals along the fronds which provide buoyancy. The alga varies in morphology; the rachis, or central strip, of the frond may be smooth or corrugated, and the blades along the edge of the rachis may be a variety of shapes.

Mount Kamui (Lake Mashū caldera)

, also Kamuinupuri or Mount Mashū, a potentially active volcano, is a parasitic stratovolcano of the Mashū caldera (itself originally a parasitic cone of Lake Kussharo) located in the Akan National Park of Hokkaido, Japan.
Volcanism.
Mount Kamui rose on the rim of 6 km-wide Mashū caldera, about four thousand years ago, after the collapse of Mashū volcano. Its last eruption took place about 1000 years ago.
Tourism.
Hikers can follow a 7.2 km wooded trail to the peak of the mountain, walking along the ridge of the caldera, which is a 300-m vertical drop to the surface of the Lake Mashū, offering spectacular views.

Lionel Cooper (mathematician)

Jacob Lionel Bakst Cooper (27 December 1915 – 8 August 1979) was a South African mathematician who worked in operator theory, transform theory, thermodynamics, functional analysis and differential equations.
Development.
Cooper was born in Beaufort West, Wester Cape, South Africa. Following the death of his father in 1919, the family moved to Cape Town where he attended the South African College School. His ability was soon recognized and he was encouraged to become a rabbi. However he rejected the Jewish faith and instead studied mathematics and physics at the University of Cape Town, where he won the Governor General’s prize for pure mathematics. He took an active part in student politics becoming a socialist member of the Student’s Parliament, with strong views against racism and Nazism.
He won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford and started to study at Queen's College in 1935, obtaining his D.Phil. in 1940 under the supervision of Edward Charles Titchmarsh. His work made an immediate impact and as early as January 1939 he was invited to speak at Hadamard’s seminar in the Collège de France.
While in Oxford he joined the Communist party, where he met his future wife Kathleen Dixon. Turned down for active service due to his poor eyesight, he worked for the Bristol Aeroplane Company from 1940 to 1944. During this time he became disenchanted with Russia’s non-aggression pact with the Nazis and left the Communist party.
Academic career.
From 1944 he lectured at Birkbeck College and for a short time Imperial College, and was awarded the Berwick Prize in 1949. His correspondence of that year included two letters from Albert Einstein concerning possible logical inconsistencies in quantum mechanics.
In 1951 he was appointed professor at the Cardiff University where he stayed until 1963 apart from a break in 1954 when he spent some time in the University of Witwatersrand. From 1952 to 1959 he edited the proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. After leaving Cardiff he spent three years in North America, as visiting professor at Caltech during 1964, followed by a two year stay at the University of Toronto. While in Toronto he edited the Canadian Journal of Mathematics.
In 1967 he returned to the UK to serve as head of the mathematics department at the newly constituted Chelsea College, University of London, where he remained until his death.
Mathematics.
Within operator theory, Cooper worked in the area of linear operators on real or complex Hilbert spaces. He studied the unbounded operators that arose from quantum theory, extending basic work of Frigyes Riesz and John von Neumann.
Within transform theory, he worked on the representation and uniqueness of integral transforms, on approximation, and on linear transformations that satisfy functional relations arising from representations of linear groups. In this he collaborated closely with P.L. Butzer of RWTH Aachen.

A Concise Treatise on the Art of Angling

A Concise Treatise on the Art of Angling- "Confirmed by Actual Experiences and Minute Observations to Which is Added the Compleat Fly-Fisher" is a fly fishing book written by Thomas Best, first published in London in 1787.
Synopsis.
Although the first part of "A Concise Treatise" is a general angling work that provided little new information when it was published, the second part of the book--"The Complete Fly-Fisher" was one of the earliest how-to books on the subject of fly fishing and artificial fly making. The book proved to be extremely popular and useful, being issued in thirteen editions from 1787 to 1846.
Reviews.
"A Concise Treatise on the Art of Angling". . . . By Thomas Best, Gent. Late of his Majesty's Drawing Room in the Tower, London, appeared in 1787. Thirteen editions of this work were published;, to the tenth and eleventh editions the greater part of Nobbes' Compleat Troller was added. This book, though it contains nothing strikingly original, is a thoroughly practical treatise on the
art of angling...
He makes mention of the multiplying reel, the first time we hear of it, but evidently not unknown before his day. In the second part of the book, which has the special title "The Complete Fly-fisher", he describes the dressing of many flies and their killing powers. Upon the whole, it is a practical and sensible work.

Freedom of Choice Act

"For other uses, see Freedom of choice (disambiguation)"
The Freedom of Choice Act (/) was a bill in the 110th United States Congress which "declares that it is the policy of the United States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a child; terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability; or terminate a pregnancy after viability when necessary to protect her life or her health."
It prohibits a federal, state, or local governmental entity from denying or interfering with a woman's right to exercise such choices; or discriminating against the exercise of those rights in the regulation or provision of benefits, facilities, services, or information. Provides that such prohibition shall apply retroactively.
It also authorizes an individual aggrieved by a violation of this Act to obtain appropriate relief, including relief against a governmental entity, in a civil action."
Earlier versions of the bill were introduced in 1989 and 1993.
Findings.
The bill states in its findings section that Congress has the affirmative power to legislate abortion based, in part, on the crossing of state lines by abortion providers, women seeking abortions, and medical supplies used in abortions.
Sponsorship.
The Freedom of Choice Act was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Jerrold Nadler, and originally co-sponsored by Congressman James Greenwood, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, and Congresswoman Diana Degette. In the Senate, it was sponsored by Senator Barbara Boxer, and originally co-sponsored by Senators Jon Corzine, Patty Murray, Frank Lautenberg, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Maria Cantwell, Jim Jeffords, Joseph Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein, Paul Sarbanes, and Barbara Mikulski. The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on January 21, 2004, and in the United States Senate on January 22, 2004.
Status.
The bills were referred to the Judiciary Committees of the respective Houses. Neither bill received further action in the 108th Congress. The bills were reintroduced in the 110th Congress, but, like their predecessors, were referred to committee without further action. As of June 2009, the bills have not been introduced in the 111th Congress.
During his tenure in the United States Senate, Barack Obama co-sponsored the 2007 Senate version of the Freedom of Choice Act (). Responding to a question regarding how he would preserve reproductive rights in a speech given to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund on July 17, 2007, Obama declared, "The first thing I'd do, as president, is sign the Freedom of Choice Act. That's the first thing that I'd do."
In a press conference on April 29, 2009, President Obama said that although he supports a woman's right to choose, passage of the Freedom of Choice Act was "not highest legislative priority."
Description and criticism.
The bill is described by NARAL Pro-Choice America president Nancy Keenan as a bill to "codify Roe v. Wade" which would "repeal the Bush-backed Federal Abortion Ban," referring to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, "and other federal restrictions". Opponents of FOCA assert that it would, if passed, invalidate every restriction on abortion nationwide, including parental notification laws, informed consent laws, and bans on partial birth abortion. However, the bill would still prohibit partial birth abortions due to the wording of the bill and the stated definition of viability, the stage of pregnancy when there is a reasonable likelihood of the sustained survival of the fetus outside of the woman. 
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has been strongly opposed to the Freedom of Choice Act. According to the USCCB's Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities, FOCA would not only "codify the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in "Roe v. Wade"" but "in allowing and promoting abortion, FOCA goes far beyond even "Roe"."
Opponents of FOCA assert that the bill would force taxpayers to subsidize abortion and would jeopardize existing laws prohibiting abortions in public hospitals and barring non-physicians from performing abortions. Others estimate that the passage of FOCA would result in approximately 125,000 more abortions being performed annually in the United States. Some opponents argue that FOCA would effectively repeal the Hyde Amendment, a federal law which bars the use of federal funding for abortions in some cases. Legal scholar Douglas Kmiec, a pro-life Republican, disagrees with the latter assertion, noting that the Hyde Amendment is renewed annually by Congress; Kmiec argues that this legislation would not supersede it.
Those who oppose the Act interpret it as an attempt to obligate religious hospitals to either "do abortions or close", while FOCA supporters argue that existing conscience clause laws would protect religious hospitals. In early 2009, Catholic News Service asserted that in its interpretation of the legislation, FOCA neither poses any such risk to Catholic hospitals, nor would require religious hospitals to participate in abortion. Opponents, however, assert that conscience clauses are weak and easily reinterpreted, and do not explicitly allow religious hospitals to ban the abortion procedure within the hospital.
The pro-life organization Americans United for Life has begun a petition called Fight FOCA which it plans to send to Congress if the Act is reintroduced in the 111th Congress.

Paul Calandra (born May 13, 1970) is a Canadian politician. He was elected to represent the electoral district of Oak Ridges—Markham in the 2008 Canadian federal election. He is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada and in the past has been involved in the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and the Canadian Alliance.
Background.
Prior to entering politics, Calandra was an insurance broker, from 1995 to 2003. He then served as chief of staff to Steve Gilchrist, who served as the Ontario Progressive Conservative MPP for Scarborough East in the government of Mike Harris.
He ran as the federal Canadian Alliance candidate in the Scarborough East riding in the 2000 election, but lost to Liberal Party of Canada candidate John McKay.
Politics.
Following his election in 2008, in Calandra’s first term he sat on the Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics Committee, Citizenship and Immigration Committee, and the Government Operations and Estimates Committee.
During this term he also introduced two private member's bills. On June 19, 2009 he introduced ‘An Act to Change the Name of the Electoral District of Oak Ridges—Markham’, and on March 11, 2011 he introduced ‘An Act Respecting the Establishment of a National Strategy for the Purchase and Sale of Second-Hand Precious Metal Articles.

Count Aage of Rosenborg

Aage, Count of Rosenborg (Aage Christian Alexander Robert; June 10, 1887 – February 19, 1940), was a Danish prince and officer of the French Foreign Legion. He was born in Copenhagen the eldest child and son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark and Princess Marie d'Orléans.
Romance and Marriage.
Prince Aage carried on a passionate flirtation with Princess Marie Bonaparte, the wife of his cousin Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who had also enjoyed intimacies with his father. In neither case does it appear that Prince George objected, or felt obliged to give the matter any attention. In 1909 Prince Aage joined the Danish Army, and by 1913 had risen to the rank of lieutenant. During World War I he served as an observer in Italy for a year. Returning home to Denmark he was promoted to captain.
Without the legally required permission of the Danish king, Aage married Matilda Calvi "dei conti di Bergolo" (Buenos Aires, 17 September 1885 – Copenhagen, 16 October 1949), daughter of Carlo Giorgio Lorenzo Calvi, 5th Count di Bergolo by his wife Baroness Anna Guidobono Calvalchini Roero San Severino, in Turin on 1 February 1914. A few days later, he renounced his place in the line of succession to the Danish throne, forfeiting his title of "Prince of Denmark", and his style of "Royal Highness". With the king's authorisation, he assumed the title "Prince Aage, "Greve af" (Count of) "Rosenborg"" and the style of "Highness" on 5 February 1914. Although the comital title in the Danish nobility was made hereditary for all of his legitimate descendants in the male line, use of the princely prefix was restricted to himself and his wife alone. Aage and Mathilde had one son before their divorce in 1939:
Foreign Legion.
In 1922, Aage received permission from the king, as required by Danish law, to leave the Danish army in order to join the French Foreign Legion. And after negotiations between the Danish and the French governments Prince Aage entered the Foreign Legion with the rank of captain.
He went into battle in Morocco within a year of service. He received the Croix de Guerre after being shot in the left leg. During his seventeen years in the Foreign Legion Prince Aage attained the rank of lieutenant colonel, and also received France's highest medal, the "Légion d'honneur".
In 1927 he published the book "A royal adventurer" in English about his time in the Foreign Legion.
Death.
Prince Aage died of pleurisy in Taza, Morocco, in 1940, and was buried in Sidi Bel Abbès, Algeria. Before the Foreign Legion left Algeria in 1962, it was decided that the remains of three selected soldiers should be brought to the new headquarters in France. The remains of Prince Aage were selected as the representation of the foreign officers in the Foreign Legion. As of today, his remains lie next to those of "Général" Rollet and "légionnaire" Zimmermann in the town of Puyloubier, France.

Kyeong-Hee Choi

Kyeong-Hee Choi is an associate professor of modern Korean literature at the University of Chicago. Prior to teaching at Chicago, Choi was a professor at Indiana University.
Her recent research and teaching interests have been focused around the relationships between historical and literary representation and the experience of modern Koreans, including colonial rule, national division, the Korean War, the Cold War, and democratization. During her work in these directions, she has also pursued issues and questions surrounding gender, focusing on writings of women of color and feminist criticism.
Her first book, to be published by Cornell University Press, will be titled "Beneath the Vermilion Ink: Japanese Colonial Censorship and the Making of Modern Korean Literature". It studies the role of Japanese colonial censorship in constituting and shaping modern Korean literature, both physically and substantively. Her next book project is tentatively titled "Rewritten in Divided Korea: Colonial Literature as History, 1945-1960" and seeks to investigate the emergence of competing modern national canons in divided Korea.
Choi also sits on the Advisory Board of "positions" and the Editorial Collective of "Public Culture". Both are scholarly journals published by Duke University Press.

Gareth Sibson

Gareth JH Sibson (born 1977) is a writer and broadcaster. His debut novel, "Single White Failure" was a frank look at relationships in London. The book drew on his own experiences of dating in London and analysed the women of a generation inspired by Bridget Jones and Sex and the City. Before becoming a writer and broadcaster, Sibson practised as a lawyer in The City. He comments on a variety of social and legal issues.
Biography.
Early life.
Sibson originally hails from Holt, Norfolk and continues to have strong ties to the county. Prior to University, Sibson was a Sir Peter Kirk scholar and remains actively involved with the Trust. He also worked as a pupil Attorney in Barbados at the Chambers of Mia Amor Mottley, head of the Barbados Labour Party. He went up to University College, Durham to read law and later went on to qualify with the leading London law firm, Lovells. He specialised in property law but left private practice in 2005 to focus on his writing and broadcasting career.
At this time Sibson was offered an apprenticeship with the "enfant terrible" of the journalist world, Toby Young ("How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"). During his time with Young, Sibson helped him stage the play "Who’s The Daddy?". a sex farce about the David Blunkett/Kimberley Quinn scandal and the "Sextator" affairs of Boris Johnson and Rod Liddle. It was named Best New Comedy at the 2006 Theatregoers' Choice Awards.
Writer and broadcaster.
At the end of 2005, Sibson had his debut novel published, "Single White Failure". He wrote the real life story because he felt men were misrepresented in contemporary fiction. It was a thinking man’s retort to Chic Lit such as "Bridget Jones" and "Sex and the City". He wanted to write about real women and the things they do in relationships, writing against the popular myths that he saw in the media and elsewhere. 
At the same time he began the internationally successful blog ChasingBridget.com – his satirical quest to track down the perfect Bridget Jones. 15,000 woman a day were logging on, claiming to be the real Bridget, from Birmingham to Bangalore. Reports on Sibson appeared around the globe.
Sibson is a media commentator. He appears on TV and radio with credits including NBC’s Today Programme, Sky One’s "Taste", UKTV Style’s "How To Find a Husband". He has written for the "Daily Mail" and "The Sun" online and is often asked to comment on stories by the likes of The Sunday Times. He is also the resident relationships expert at Colourful Radio.
"The Sunday Times" dubbed Sibson 'The Dr Dolittle of Relationships'. And The Evening Standard said, 'If you've lost your faith in men he might just restore it'.
In 2008 and 2009 he opened the London Book Fair with fellow writers Joanna Trollope and Adele Parks.
He appears on radio talking about the book world, relationships, the modern woman and gender issues. 
In the past he has been involved with various TV production companies as a presenter. Most recently he has been involved with the BBC in developing a legal affairs program.
Personal.
Sibson lives in South London. He has a passion for Regency architecture. He spends part of his time working for charities such as the educational trust, The Sir Peter Kirk Fund. He is also a supporter of the women’s charity The Fawcett Society.

Libya–Vanuatu relations

Libya–Vanuatu relations refer to foreign relations between Vanuatu and Libya. They established official diplomatic relations in 1986, at the initiative of the former. The aim, for Vanuatu, was twofold: first, to obtain access to favourable economic relations with a major oil-producing country, and second, to strengthen its policy of non-alignment by establishing relations with a notable country not aligned with the Western Bloc. Vanuatu's foreign policy in the 1980s, under Prime Minister Father Walter Lini, was based on refusing alignment with either bloc in the context of the Cold War, distinguishing it from every other country of Oceania, aligned with the West. "Time" magazine described Libya's reasons for establishing relations with Vanuatu as "unclear", suggesting that it might simply wish to "irritate the U.S. and France". Vanuatu's relations with both France and the United States were strained at the time.
Vanuatu condemned the 1986 bombing of Libya by the United States. Lini wrote to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to express his condoleances, notably at the death of Gaddafi's 15-month-old daughter, and his dismay that "innocent lives have been taken by the bombs of a superpower". Barak Sopé added that "the United States were wrong, they behaved as terrorists and aggressors", and that "the CIA is involved in all sorts of similar activities. In Nicaragua, the Americans are supporting terrorists."
In 1987, several ni-Vanuatu received "security training" in Libya at their government's request, prompting concern from Bob Hawke's government in Australia. Australia also expressed discomfort at the possible opening of a Libyan embassy in Vanuatu.
The country's relations with Libya proved politically contentious in Vanuatu, including within the ruling Vanua'aku Party. While Prime Minister Walter Lini and party Secretary-General Barak Sopé defended their decision to engage with Libya, Foreign Affairs Minister Sela Molisa was critical. The debate appeared to explain Lini's eventual decision to "postpone indefinitely" the projected opening of a Libyan People's Bureau in Port Vila.
Lini lost office in 1991, and his successors did little to maintain Libyan–ni-Vanuatu relations, which thereafter all but lapsed.
In September 2011, Vanuatu was one of 114 states to vote in favour of awarding Libya's seat in the United Nations to the National Transitional Council, following the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in the 2011 Libyan civil war.

Trick tank

A trick tank is a watering device for livestock or wildlife. It collects precipitation, holds the water in a covered tank to minimize evaporation and maintain adequate water quality, and dispenses water on demand into a basin from which animals can drink. Dispensing may be regulated by a mechanical float device similar to a ballcock in the tank of a flush toilet.
Trick tanks are manufactured in several styles, including inverted umbrella and apron. They are heavy and often are used in remote wilderness locations, to which they may require delivery via helicopter.
To provide water to wild animals, not livestock, fencing may be built to surround a trick tank. Fences serve to exclude cattle and sheep. Trick tanks are widely used in the southwest United States, where periodic droughts may cause population crashes in game animals unless water supplies are provided.

<doc id="19789664" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19789664" title="George Stapledon">
George Stapledon

Sir Reginald George Stapledon FRS (born Northam, Devon on 22 September 1882 - died in Bath, Somerset on 16 September 1960) was an English grassland scientist and pioneer environmentalist.
Early life.
The sixth of the seven children born to shipping agent William Stapledon and Mary Clibbert (daughter of shipbuilder William Clibbert), Stapledon also had three half-siblings. The family claimed to be related to Walter de Stapledon, the 14th century Bishop of Exeter. Educated at United Services College, Westward Ho!, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge (where to took the natural science tripos of geology, chemistry and botany) he worked in Suez for the family firm between 1904 and 1906 before giving up the commercial life.
Grassland sciences.
Developing a strong support for the idea of agricultural autarky, he returned to the University of Cambridge in 1907 to study biology and in 1910 joined the Royal Agricultural College where he came to argue that grasslands were at the heart of successful agriculture which in turn was at the heart of Britain's economic and spiritual well-being. He moved to University College of Wales in 1912 and whilst there married Doris Wood Bourne, who joined him in his work. Here he headed up a newly created Department of Botany. Between 1914 and 1918 he worked for the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in London and succeeded in getting them to set up a seed testing station.
His longest service however was as director of a plant breeding station in Aberystwyth, a post he held from 1919 to 1942. This had been set up using a £10,000 grant from Sir Laurence Philipps, who contributed a further £1000 for the first ten years of the institute's existence. Stapledon came to love the natural beauty of Wales and indeed argued that anybody who interfered with the 'shapely outline' of the Cambrian Mountains should be treated as a criminal. Following an ecological approach he developed a number of new varieties of grass, oats and clover, known as 'S' strains, and increased awareness of the importance of grasslands in agriculture, particularly in New Zealand where his work was especially influential. He had visited the country in 1926 during a bout of ill health and whilst there made a strong impression on Bruce Levy who followed much of Stapledon's work. His work was recognised in 1939 when he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and knighted. His work on grasslands continued during the Second World War when he took up the directorship of the grassland research station at Drayton, Stratford upon Avon in 1942, whilst he was also a founder member and first President of the British Grassland Society. Around this time he became a strong advocate of ley farming, feeling that it would help to feed Britain during the conflict. He also persuaded the government to set up a grassland research station at Hurley, Berkshire before his retirement in 1946.
Politics and writing.
As well as producing a number of scientific papers Stapledon also produced a number of works that were more political in tone, notably "The Land: Now and Tomorrow" (1935), "The Way of the Land" (1943), and "Disraeli and the New Age" (1943). In these he developed his idea of renewing society by making farming the central part of economic life. Looking for a return to small-holdings based on some of the social reforming ideas of Benjamin Disraeli, Stapledon argued that capitalism should exist only to serve his new rural vision. He was also a strong supporter of the National Parks movement, arguing that they were an important factor in bringing the city dweller into contact with the countryside. He found kindred spirits in some of the highly conservative rural organisations that existed at the time and was a member of both Rolf Gardiner's Kinship in Husbandry group and Montague Fordham's Rural Reconstruction Association.
Later life.
Given the low-levels of pensions for government science workers he was forced to return to work in 1947, accepting the position of Science Adviser to the Messrs Dunn's Farm Seeds company in Salisbury. His work was interrupted in 1952 by major surgery and he spent the rest of his life in severe ill health, suffering variously from angina, kidney problems, bronchitis, Ménière's disease and in his final three years profound hearing loss.
His contributions to science were honoured by a number of awards apart from the FRS and knighthood. He was an honorary member of the Highland and Agricultural Society and the Academies of Agriculture of Sweden and Czechoslovakia, received the Gold Medal of the Royal Agricultural Society and, in 1932, the CBE. Both the University of Nottingham (1951) and the University of Wales (1952) conferred honorary doctorates on him, although he was unable to accept the same honour from the University of Durham in 1958 as his ill health meant he was unable to travel to accept the award.
He died without offspring in 1960, having suffered several nervous breakdowns from 1926 onwards. His life was commemorated by the BBC who organised a series of tributes entitled 'I Remember Stapledon' for both the Welsh Service and then the Home Service. His nephew was the science fiction writer and philosopher Olaf Stapledon, son of George Stapledon's eldest brother William.

Prince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg ("Viggo Christian Adolf Georg", 25 December 1893 – 4 January 1970) was a Danish and Icelandic prince. He was born in Copenhagen the youngest son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark and Princess Marie of Orléans.
Biography.
Without the legally required permission of the Danish king for a dynastic marriage, Viggo married Eleanor Margaret Green (New York City, New York, 5 November 1895 – Copenhagen, 3 July 1966), in New York City, New York, on 10 June 1924.
As became customary in the Danish royal house upon marriage to a commoner, prior to the wedding Viggo renounced his place in Denmark's line of succession to the Crown, his title of "Prince of Denmark", and his style of "Royal Highness". With the king's authorisation, he assumed the title "Prince Viggo, "Greve af" (Count of) "Rosenborg"" and the style of "Highness" on 21 December 1923. Although the comital title was made hereditary for all of his legitimate descendants in the male line, the princely title was restricted to himself and his wife alone (i.e. "Prince and Princess Viggo", etc.). The couple had no children.
Prince Viggo died in Ebeltoft in 1970.

Both boats had been offered to the IGN free of charge by Schichau in an attempt to gain experience in building submarines. When construction of the two boats began to lag behind due to shortages in raw materials and lack of experience in submarine construction they were declared "war boats" ("Kriegsboote"), formally ordered by the "Reichsmarineamt" and given their respective designation. On 20 October 1918 Schichau-Werke reported "U 115" would not be ready for delivery until the spring of 1919. Nevertheless 14 more boats of the class were ordered on 29 June 1918 for delivery in 1919.

Anylite Technology is the name of a solar technology used in some calculators made by Texas Instruments. They are intended to be able to function with less light than other solar calculators. This was essentially achieved by using a relatively large solar panel. Anylite Technology originated in the 1980s and the term is still used today. Note how "Anylite" is very similar to the words "any light", which is how it is intended to be pronounced.
The use of Anylite technology in a calculator is denoted by a lower case "a" at the end of the model number (TI-30a). In older models, such as the TI-36 Solar (shown right), "Anylite Solar" is written in all capital letters on the calculator.

Monticello High School (Minnesota)

Monticello High School is a public high school located in Monticello, Minnesota, United States.
The Principal is Joel Lundin and the Vice Principal is Mike Carr. The current high school was constructed in the late '90's by architects Rego and Youngquist and officially opened in September 1999. Monticello High School (enrollment 1,298) is Wright County's third largest school. The nickname for the school's athletic teams is the Magic.
Monticello residents appreciate and expect a high level of service from their Community Education Department and school recreation programs. In an effort to maximize communication with parents, Monticello High School utilizes an on-line program called Parent Portal where parents can access student grades, attendance, and assignments. Also, community demand for recreation opportunities is high.
Athletics.
Monticello competes in the Mississippi 8 Conference, consisting of eight other central Minnesota schools. Prior to the formation of the Mississippi 8 Conference, the Magic competed in the North Suburban Conference, and at one time the Wright County Conference. For a majority of the school's history, Monticello High School's nickname was the Redmen. After controversy arose over the name, their nickname changed to the Wildcats for a two-week period, before settling on the Magic. Monticello High School's main rival is the neighboring Buffalo High School.
Boys' basketball is the most notable MHS athletic program. The team made several trips to the state tournament in the 1990s and from 2004 to 2006. The team's highest tournament finish is 4th place, igniting theories of a possible "4th place curse". Two Minnesota high-school basketball Players of the Year have come out of Monticello: Nate Holmstadt and Joel Przybilla. The 7-foot Przybilla went on to play for the University of Minnesota and is currently a center in the NBA for the Milwaukee Bucks.
The Monticello boys' soccer team is a perennial powerhouse, winning the Mississippi Conference Championship five years straight from 2004 to 2009. During that same five-year period, on three separate occasions, the team lost the section championship game in shoot-outs and has thus yet to succeed in gaining a bid to the state tournament. In 2006, the boys' soccer team ranked second in the state in total goals scored.
In Monticello's 2006 homecoming game against Rogers High School, Monticello won 21–0, their first homecoming win since 1989. They did not win their homecoming again until 2011.
The Monticello girls' lacrosse team, also known as the Montiquois, have won the state league tournament for four consecutive years now. However, the lacrosse team is not a school sponsored sport.
The boys' lacrosse team, Montiquois, won the state championship title in 2011. Like the girls, they are also not a school sponsored sport..
In 2011, the girls' hockey team, the North Wright County Riverhawks, a co-op of STMA, Annandale and Monticello High Schools, qualified for the state tournament for the first time, after defeating Roseau High School in the 8AA section finals.
In 2011, the girls' cross country team won the state cross country championship in class AA, becoming Monticello's first team to win a state championship in the Minnesota State High School League.
In 2012, the boys' swimming and diving team took second place in class A state, and won 4 of the 12 events.
And most importantly, home of the Riders of Brohan.
Activities.
In 2009 the Monticello High School mock trail team took fourth place at the state competition in Duluth, MN.
Facilities.
The Moose Sherritt Ice Arena, attached to the Middle School, was completed in 2005 due to the efforts of the Monticello-Annandale-Maple Lake Youth Hockey Organization, community members, the mayor, the city council, the school board, businesses and the Sherritt family. The arena is named in honor of Gordon "Moose" Sherritt who played for the NHL's Detroit Red Wings and the USHL's Minneapolis Millers among other teams in the 1940s, and was a long time Monticello resident.
The Field House is attached to the High School and conatains a 200 meter indoor track and basketball courts. The main court has been used to host Minnesota State High School League section semifinals and finals.

Christakis Zografos

Christakis Zografos (, 1820, Qestorat, Ottoman Empire (now in Albania) – 19 August 1898, Paris, France) was a Greek banker holding Ottoman citizenship, benefactor and one of the distinguished personalities of the Greek community of Constantinople (modern Istanbul).
Early years-Career.
Zografos was born in the village of Qestorat in southern Albania (Northern Epirus), when the region was under Ottoman rule. He attended the Zosimaia School in Ioannina and then went to Istanbul to join his father's business there. He was initially a co-partner in a small money changing stand at Galata. During 1854-1881, Christakis became one of the major creditors of the Ottoman state. Zografos became one of the leading banker and financiers and president of the Ottoman capital's trolley company. He was awarded by three sultans and sat on the Imperial Board of Estimate and served as president of the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Clerico-Lay Advisory Board. Because of the social status he acquired among the society of the Ottoman capital he was widely known as Christakis Effendi (Lord Christakis).
Benefaction.
Christakis Zografos donated huge fortunes and lavishly endowed educational and other community facilities to the Greek communities living in regions that belonged, that time, to the Ottoman empire.
He offered an enormous amount of money for the erection of middle level schools in Constantinople, the one (Zographeion Lyceum) in the district of Beyoğlu (Pera) in Constantinople and the other a female school in Yeniköy on the Bosporus, both schools were called 'Zografeion' after him. Moreover, sponsored the rebuilding of a Greek library in the city. At the Universities of Munich and Paris he made an 1,000 Franc endowment for awards in the fields of Greek literature and history.
In his home place in Epirus he founded a male and female teachers college (Zographeion College) where the graduates became Greek language teachers. Zografos offered on annual base scholarships to 60 assiduous students (30 females and 30 males) that came from poor families, with complete coverage of their living costs.
Other grands went to the Patriarchate's Halki seminary on Heybeliada (Halki), while he was awarded with the Gold Cross of the Ecumenical Patriarch Joachim II.
His son Georgios Christakis-Zografos became a notable diplomat, politician and head of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus (1914).
Legacy.
During the Communist regime in Albania (1945–1992), Zografos and his son G. Christakis-Zografos, were stigmatised as 'enemies of the state'. Anyone from his home town who held the name 'Zografos' (whether relatives or not), was therefore persecuted. After 1992 however, the situation has changed. Today, the Zografeio school in Qestorati, founded by himself, has been renovated and has reopened as a museum.

Synergy Sports Technology

Synergy Sports Technology is a technology company that provides a real-time, video-indexing statistical engine and online retrieval platform to the sports and entertainment industry.
Its services are used primarily by professional and amateur basketball teams. For example, every team in the National Basketball Association uses Synergy’s web-based services for, among other things, evaluating players for the draft, trades and free agency, developing the team’s own players and for scouting opponents. Synergy logs every possession of every basketball game according to team-specified criteria. Resulting data is then interlaced with league-generated stats to produce visual displays that provide intelligence on player and team tendencies.
Synergy’s “ontological” tagging methods (patent pending) provide flexibility and varied workflow functions. Clients can add their own tags to video from remote locations, enabling organizations to synchronously collaborate. At any time, clips can be saved to create custom edits. Once video and/or data is placed into the Synergy video platform, the company provides immediate Internet access to content, while managing the creation of automated and custom edits, stats displays, video e-mail functions, iPod transfers, and smart phone access as well as a number of consumer-facing applications.
There were two significant corporate developments in 2008. Synergy announced in July 2008 a multi-year licensing agreement with the NBA that will give NBA TV (the league’s 24-hour network), NBA.com and the league’s television partners access to Synergy products and services. Two months later, Synergy announced its partnership with EA Sports, which calls for the developer and publisher of interactive entertainment and games software to incorporate data from Synergy into its products.
History.
Garrick Barr, a former member of the Phoenix Suns coaching staff, founded the company as Quantified Scouting Service in 1998. Six years later, the company was renamed Synergy and Barr was joined by co-founder Nils Lahr. Previously, Lahr had developed VXtreme streaming media solutions, which was later purchased by Microsoft and became a founding technology for Windows Media and MPEG4.

The Hawthorne House, also known as the Col. J. R. Hawthorne House, is a historic plantation house in Pine Apple, Alabama. The two-story wood-frame house was built in 1854 for Joseph Richard Hawthorne by Ezra Plumb. Joseph Hawthorne was born in 1805 in North Carolina, but the family had relocated to Wilkinson County, Georgia by 1810. Hawthorne moved to Conecuh County, Alabama in the 1830s and finally settled in Pine Apple in the 1850s. He owned several large plantations in Conecuh and Wilcox counties. He died in Pine apple in 1889. The house was sold out of the family after his death, but was brought back into the family when acquired in 1935 by Gladys Hawthorne Whitaker and her brother, Dr. Julian Hawthorne, a New York physician. They restored the house and it remained in the family until Mrs. Whitaker's death in 1980. The house was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1937. It was purchased after the death of Mrs. Whitaker by Dr. Edward Childs of Mobile. The house was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on November 9, 1992 and to the National Register of Historic Places on March 7, 1985.

Bloomex

Bloomex is a national Canadian floral company offering various floral and gift arrangements throughout Canada, Australia
and the United States via its online order system. The company, headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, is privately held by its founder and president, Dimitri Lokhonia.
Business model.
Bloomex is a floristry business that ships flower arrangements and other gift related items direct to consumers.
The company was established in 2005 and maintains its headquarters and call centre in Ottawa. The company owns virtual telephone numbers that connect customers to the Ottawa call center when they dial a number in their local area code.
Controversy.
On March 1, 2008, "Toronto Star" business and consumer affairs columnist Ellen Roseman reported on Bloomex online complaints, offering one customer's experience with a promised same-day delivery as an example of company unresponsiveness. 
In a follow-up "Star" column the next week, company president Lokhonia examined Roseman's late-delivery example, explaining that the order was entered past the deadline for same-day delivery, it was delivered according to the company's published terms and conditions, and the company never refunds delivery charges in such cases in order to maintain its low prices.
Lokhonia also alleged that some complaints were actually written by small retail florists in competition with Bloomex,
a statement that drew fresh online complaints.
In June 2008, Bloomex issued a press release admitting that the company had made mistakes in the past due to unexpectedly strong sales growth, and announced new systems to improve customer satisfaction.
In April 2010, the CBC News television program "Marketplace" tested Bloomex's promises, reporting that the company "...sometimes substitutes one item for something completely different, without checking with the customer, or doesn't deliver at all". A "Chocolate Lovers" basket contained far less chocolate than promised; of three floral arrangements ordered, one failed to arrive and the other two were not as advertised, receiving a "thumbs down" from a professional flower judge.
As of January 2013, the Canadian Better Business Bureau (BBB) continues to give Bloomex its lowest possible rating, an "F". An alert posted above the Bloomex rating states "BBB files indicate that this business has a pattern of complaints concerning delays and or non-delivery of goods, slow responses to customer inquiries and refund payments."

HMS Vancouver (1917)

HMS "Vancouver" was a British V-class destroyer. She was launched on 28 December 1917; in July 1922 she accidentally rammed the submarine "H24". She was renamed HMS "Vimy" in April 1928. She served with distinction during World War II, earning two battle honours and damaging or sinking three enemy submarines. The Royal Navy retired her in 1945 and she was scrapped in 1948.
Service during World War II.
On 6 February 1940, "Vimy" rescued the sole survivor of a crew of four from an Avro Anson that had crashed into the sea while escorting a convoy.
In May 1940 she participated in the Dunkirk evacuation. Anticipating the need, the Royal Navy had sent 200 seaman and marines aboard "Vimy", to organise the port of Boulogne on 23 May. At one point, fired at her but without result as the torpedoes were faulty. Also on 23 May, small arms fire from the shore fatally wounded Lieutenant Commander Colin Donald, her captain, and killed the officer of the watch, Sub Lieutenant Webster. Lt Cdr Donald was carried below and died in hospital in Dover; the first lieutenant took temporary command. Lieutenant Commander Donald's replacement as captain was found to be missing on the second day of the Dunkirk evacuation, and the crew searched the entire vessel for him without result.
On 1 June, "Vimy" collided with and sank the yacht "Amulree" in the Gull Channel, to the west of the Goodwin Sands. That same day an air attack caused some damage. During the evacuation of Dunkirk, "Vimy" transported 2,976 troops; for her efforts she received the battle honours "Dunkirk 1940".
In 1941 she was reconstructed to long range escort, the work being finished in June 1941. On 21 September 1941, depth charges from "Vimy" damaged the Italian "Luigi Torelli", which was attempting to attack Convoy HG 73, west of Gibraltar.
On 3 September 1942, depth charges from the British destroyers "Vimy", "Pathfinder" and "Quentin" sank the German submarine in the mid-Atlantic north-east of Trinidad, in position . The U-boat had had a particularly successful year to that point, having sunk 14 vessels totaling 82,000 tons. "Vimy"'s captain, Lieutenant Commander de Chair received the DSC for this action. All but three of the submarine's crew survived to be taken prisoner. Her captain, Jürgen Wattenberg, went on to organize a break from the POW camp at Papago Park, in Arizona.
On 18 September, "Vimy" rescued survivors from the US merchantman "SS West Lashaway", which had sunk on 30 August.
On 4 February 1943, " Vimy" and "Beverley", using HF/DF, located , which was shadowing Convoy SC 118 in the North Atlantic, south of Greenland at the exit of the Baffin Bay. Depth charges from the three destroyers sank the submarine south-east of Cape Farewell, Greenland. "U-187" was on her first cruise and had not had any successes. Nine of her crew members perished, including the commander, during the sinking, but "Vimy" and "Beverley" rescued 45 men from the water. Stannard received a DSO for "Vimy's" contribution to breaking up the U-boat pack hunting SC-118.
Fate.
"Vimy" was no longer listed as an active unit in the July 1945 "Navy List". She was sold for scrap in March 1947 and was scrapped at Rosyth in February 1948.

The University of Tennessee Athletic Council, chaired by Professor Nathan Dougherty, officially suspended varsity football during the World War I years of 1917 and 1918 because the majority of the players were called into military service. In addition, Coach John R. Bender was enlisted as an instructor at Camp John Sevier in Greenville, South Carolina.
During this period without varsity football, two unofficial teams were formed from Army recruits and students. One team represented a training unit called the Fighting Mechanics and the other represented the Student Army Training Corps (SATC).

1976–77 Quebec Nordiques season

The 1976–77 Quebec Nordiques season was the Nordiques 5th season, as they were coming off their best season to date in 1975–76, earning a team record 50 victories and 104 points, as they finished in second place in the Canadian Division.

During the off-season, the league saw the Toronto Toros move to Birmingham, Alabama, and be renamed the Birmingham Bulls, while the Cleveland Crusaders moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota to become the second version of the Minnesota Fighting Saints. The league was back to twelve teams from fourteen the previous season, as the original Fighting Saints and Denver Spurs/Ottawa Civics franchise folded midway through the 1975-76 season. The Nordiques would move from the Canadian Division to the Eastern Division, joining the Birmingham Bulls, Cincinnati Stingers, Indianapolis Racers, Minnesota Fighting Saints and New England Whalers in the division.

The series shifted over to Indianapolis for the next two games, but the Nordiques won the third game, defeating the Racers 6-5 in overtime to put them on the brink of elimination. Indianapolis finally managed to win a game in the fourth game of the series, shutting out the Nordiques 2-0, however, with the series back in Quebec for the fifth game, the Nordiques remained hot on home ice, easily winning the game 8-3, and advancing to the Avco Cup finals.
The Nordiques opponents in the Avco Cup finals was the Winnipeg Jets. Winnipeg was the defending champions, as they won the 1976 Avco Cup. The Jets had a record of 46-32-2, finishing with 94 points, and in second place in the Western Division. Winnipeg defeated the Edmonton Oilers and Houston Aeros to earn a spot in the finals.

"The Scotsman" newspaper commented that the album showed the band's "most beautiful, wistful storytelling to date, encasing his whimsical, witty, yet sometimes stark lyrics in some of their folkiest arrangements yet."
Listings magazine "The Skinny" gave the album 3 out of 5, saying that "this delicious long-player will merely rekindle wanting desire in long-term lovers, never eliciting the advances of fresher faced admirers".
Music Week review said "Alex Turner’s fondness for taking mundane subject matter and transforming it into something poetic may well have won him plaudits on Arctic Monkeys records, but McIntyre has been doing it for years... a little gem of an album."

The is a traditional-style Japanese "sake-house" restaurant (izakaya) located in the city of Utsunomiya, north of Tokyo, Japan. The location attracted international attention in 2008 when the Western media reported the tavern and its news movies were uploaded to YouTube.
The tavern's owner, Kaoru Otsuka, owns two pet macaque monkeys who are currently employed to work at the location. The first monkey, twelve-year-old "Yat-chan", is dressed in a shirt and shorts while he takes customers' drink orders and delivers them to the diners' tables. The restaurant's owner, Otsuka, reported that he never initially taught the monkeys; Yat-chan first learned from watching him work. Otsuka said, "It all started one day when I gave him a hot towel out of curiosity and he brought the towel to the customer." The younger macaque, named Fuku-chan, is currently four years old and has the main duty of bringing the attendees hot towels to clean their hands before ordering drinks. Fuku-chan has only two years of experience, while Yat-chan has been reportedly performing the job for a longer time.
Both monkeys receive boiled soya beans from customers as tips for their service. The monkeys' environment has been inspected to ensure proper treatment of the animals; due to Japanese animal rights regulations, they are each only allowed to work for two hours a day. The owner says that he will be introducing more simians to work as waiters at Kayabukiya, and as of October 2008 is currently training three young monkeys to take on the job. The restaurant was also featured as a reward for the winning team in the third episode of Season Two of "I Survived a Japanese Game Show".

Zhang Xiaozhong

Zhang Xiaozhong (張孝忠) (730 – April 30, 791), né Zhang Alao (張阿勞), formally Prince Zhenwu of Shanggu (上谷貞武王), was a general of the Chinese Tang Dynasty, of Xi extraction. Initially he served the rebel state Yan, during the Anshi Rebellion, and later served the warlord Li Baochen. After Li Baochen's death he joined the Imperial cause, giving the Imperial army a foothold north of the Yellow River in spite of being surrounded by semi-independent warlord realms.
Background.
Zhang Xiaozhong, initially known as Zhang Alao, was born in 730, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. He was of Xi ethnicity. His great-grandfather Zhang Jing (張靖) and grandfather Zhang Xun (張遜) were both chieftains of the Yishihuo (乙失活) tribe. During Emperor Xuanzong's "Tianbao" era (742–756), Zhang Alao's father Zhang Mi (張謐) led his tribal people in submitting to Tang rule and was given an honorary title as the minister of vassal affairs.
Zhang Alao himself was tall, brave, strong, and filially pious. In the region, he and Wang Monuogan (later known as Wang Wujun) were known as the strongest warriors. Near the end of the "Tianbao" era, as he was a capable archer, he came to serve under the Tang general An Lushan, and made contributions in defeating Tujue tribes.
During Anshi Rebellion.
In 755, An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang (范陽, in modern Beijing), and Zhang Alao served as one of his forward commanders, along with Tian Chengsi and Zhang Zhongzhi. After An declared himself emperor of a new state of Yan, Zhang Alao served as a general of the Yan state, and later served under the later Yan emperor Shi Siming and Shi Siming's son and successor Shi Chaoyi as well in their campaigns against Tang. After Yan ended with Shi Chaoyi's death in 763, Zhang Zhongzhi surrendered to Tang, was bestowed the name Li Baochen, and became a Tang general — the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Zhang Alao served under Li Baochen.
Service under Li Baochen and Li Weiyue.
While serving under Li Baochen, Zhang Alao was given a number of honorary positions, and a new name of Xiaozhong (meaning "filially pious and faithful"). Li Baochen, believing Zhang to be faithful and brave, initially trusted him greatly, and married his sister-in-law Lady Meigu to Zhang. He also entrusted Zhang with the troops from Yi Prefecture (易州, in modern Baoding, Hebei). In 775, when Tian Chengsi, then the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) wore out the patience of not only the imperial government by annexing most of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, then headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), killing Li Baochen's brother Li Baozheng (李寶正), and being disrespectful to Li Zhengji the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong commissioned a campaign against Tian. Tian preemptively attacked Chengde's Ji Prefecture (冀州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei). Li Baochen sent Zhang to defend against the attack with the Chengde elite troops, and when Tian realized that the campaign was not going well for him, he stated, "With Zhang Alao still present, I cannot take Ji Prefecture," and he withdrew. Subsequently, when Li Baochen was tricked by Tian into attacking another general, Zhu Tao, the acting military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) but was unable to seize Lulong Circuit, Li Baochen made Zhang the prefect of Yi Prefecture as precaution of a Zhu counterattack.
Toward the end of Li Baochen's life, he, who was ruling Chengde Circuit as his own domain semi-independent from the Tang imperial government, wanted to pass his position to his son Li Weiyue, but believing Li Weiyue to be weak in personality and might not be able to stand up to some of the stronger officers, he found excuses to execute many of those officers. At one point, he sent Zhang Xiaozhong's brother Zhang Xiaojie (張孝節) to Yi Prefecture to summon Zhang Xiaozhong back to the circuit capital Heng Prefecture (恆州). Zhang Xiaozhong told Zhang Xiaojie to respond to Li Baochen:
Zhang Xiaojie protested that if he returned with this message that Li Baochen would surely kill him, but Zhang Xiaozhong pointed out that if they went back together, they would both die, but if he did not go, Li Baochen would not dare to act against Zhang Xiaojie — prediction that turned out to be correct. It was said that because of this, Zhang Xiaozhong and Wang Wujun, whose son Wang Shizhen was a son-in-law to Li Baochen, were the only two senior Chengde officers who survived Li Baochen's executions.
Li Baochen died in 781, and Li Weiyue requested that Emperor Daizong's son and successor Emperor Dezong allow him to succeed Li Baochen. Emperor Dezong refused. As a result, Li Weiyue and his allies Tian Yue (Tian Chengsi's nephew, who had succeeded Tian Chengsi in 779), Li Na (Li Zhengji's son, who, similarly, was rejected by Emperor Dezong as his father's successor when Li Zhengji also died in 781), and Liang Chongyi, the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), prepared for war against the imperial government. Zhu Tao, who was then submissive to the imperial government, attacked Chengde from the north. When he reached Yi Prefecture, Zhang was defending against his attack, but Zhu sent his subordinate Cai Xiong (蔡雄) to convince Zhang that Li Weiyue's cause was hopeless and unjust. Persuaded by Zhu, Zhang submitted to the imperial government, and Emperor Dezong gave Zhang the title of military governor of Chengde. Grateful to Zhu, Zhang had his son Zhang Maohe (張貿和) marry Zhu's daughter and formed a friendship with Zhu. Hearing that Zhang Xiaozhong had turned against him, Li Weiyue slaughtered Zhang Xiaozhong's younger brother Zhang Xiaoyi (张孝义) and three daughters already married still remaining at Heng Prefecture.
As "Jiedushi".
In spring 782, Zhu Tao and Zhang Xiaozhong captured Shulu (束鹿, in modern Shijiazhuang). Li Weiyue, in fear, considered submitting to the imperial government and giving up Chengde, but after Tian Yue found out, he angrily demanded the death of Li Weiyue's secretary Shao Zhen (邵真), who had recommended submission; Li Weiyue killed Shao and sent an army, commanded by the Weibo officer Meng You (孟祐) and Wang Wujun, to try to recapture Shulu. The joint Zhu and Zhang forces, however, defeated Li Weiyue's forces — as Wang was apprehensive that if he prevailed, Li Weiyue would be without apprehension and would kill him after his return, as Li Weiyue had also been fearful of him. Zhu wanted to continue on to the capital of Chengde, Heng Prefecture, but stopped his advances when, to his surprise, Zhang backed off and withdrew to Yifeng (義豐, in modern Baoding). When his subordinates questioned this move, Zhang stated his reasons:
As Zhang predicted, Wang, once he returned to Heng Prefecture, started an uprising and killed Li Weiyue and surrendered. In the aftermaths of Li Weiyue's death, Li Weiyue's brother-in-law Yang Rongguo (楊榮國), who had been defending Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), surrendered to Zhu. With Li Weiyue and Liang (who had been defeated by Li Xilie and committed suicide) defeated and the forces loyal to the imperial government besieging Tian and Li Na, it was believed that the rebels would soon be destroyed and the empire returned to unity.
After the victory at Chengde, however, Emperor Dezong made a series of moves that simultaneously alienated Zhu and Wang. He refused to give Shen Prefecture to Lulong, as Zhu had requested. Rather, he divided the seven prefectures of Chengde into three smaller circuits, making Zhang the military governor of a newly created Yidingcang Circuit (易定滄, headquartered in modern Baoding, soon renamed to Yiwu (義武)), consisting of three prefectures, with his headquarters at Ding Prefecture (定州), while giving two prefectures each to Wang and Kang Rizhi (康日知, another Chengde general who had submitted to imperial authority during the campaign), with the lesser titles of military prefect (團練使, "Tuanlianshi"). Emperor Dezong, on paper, gave Lulong two additional prefectures — De (德州, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (棣州, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) — both still then held by Li Na. Zhu was angered by Emperor Dezong's refusal to give him any part of Chengde territory (in particular, Shen Prefecture) and requiring him to capture two additional prefectures on his own, while Wang was angered that contrary to Emperor Dezong's implicit promises to give whomever killed Li Weiyue Li Weiyue's offices, he not only received a lesser title, but was in a position where he could easily be destroyed. Tian Yue, who was then still under imperial attack, thus persuaded Zhu and Wang to join him in an alliance to defend against imperial forces. Zhu and Wang both agreed, although when Zhu further tried to persuade Zhang to join the alliance as well, Zhang refused. As Zhu advanced south to meet Wang and to aid Tian, then, he left his cousin Liu Peng in charge of Lulong Circuit, to defend against a potential attack by Zhang, while Zhang prepared for defending against attacks from Zhu and Wang. Subsequently, when Wang Wujun sent Wang Shizhen to put Kang under siege at Zhao Prefecture (趙州, in modern Shijiazhuang), the imperial general Li Sheng, whose forces had been part of the forces fighting against Tian in the south, requested leave to advance north to meet Zhang to relieve Zhao Prefecture, and Emperor Dezong agreed. Once Li Sheng arrived at Zhao Prefecture, Wang Shizhen lifted the siege and returned to Heng Prefecture. In spring 783, Li Sheng and Zhang's son Zhang Shengyun (張昇雲) attacked Zhu's officer Zheng Jingji (鄭景濟) at Qingyuan (清苑, in modern Baoding). This, however, drew a response from Zhu, who left Tian's capital Wei Prefecture (魏州) and arrived at Qingyuan to battle Li Sheng. He defeated Li Sheng, forcing Zhang Shengyun and Li Sheng, who grew ill after the defeat, back to Yiwu's capital Ding Prefecture (定州).
In fall 783, troops from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), then at Chang'an to wait for deployment to the eastern battlefield, mutinied when Emperor Dezong did not give them sufficient rewards, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). They supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu Ci soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin and put Fengtian under siege. Li Sheng, upon his recovery later in the year, wanted to head immediately toward Fengtian to aid Emperor Dezong, but as Yiwu Circuit was wedged between Zhu Tao's and Wang's territory, Zhang Xiaozhong feared that he would be attacked and so tried to keep Li Sheng at Yiwu. Only after Li Sheng bribed Zhang's subordinates with jade and also kept his son Li Ping (李憑) at Yiwu (to be married to Zhang's daughter) did Zhang agree to let Li Sheng depart, and he further had Yang Rongguo, who had become his subordinate, accompany Li Sheng to aid Emperor Dezong. In spring 784, after Emperor Dezong tried to quell various rebellions by issuing a general pardon, he gave Zhang the honorary chancellor designation of "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事).
In 786, after the realm had become relatively peaceful and submissive to Emperor Dezong's authority again, there was a famine for the region north of the Yellow River. In the aftermaths of the war, there was little food storage, and many people starved to death. During this time, Zhang reduced his own diet and ate just dried beans. It was said that the people appreciated his frugality and considered him a model of goodness. In 787, Emperor Dezong gave him the honorary title of acting "Sikong" (司空, one of the Three Excellencies), and offered to let his son Zhang Maozong (張茂宗) marry Emperor Dezong's daughter Princess Yizhang. Zhang sent his wife Lady Meigu, who was by this time carrying the title of Lady of Deng, to Chang'an to personally receive Princess Yizhang into the household, and Emperor Dezong welcomed Lady Meigu in a grand ceremony. In 789, for reasons unclear in history, Zhang attacked Wei Prefecture (蔚州, in modern Datong, Shanxi, not the same Wei Prefecture as Weibo's capital) and seized both people and livestock. Emperor Dezong issued an edict condemning the attack, and Zhang withdrew after some 10 days. As a result, Zhang was stripped of his honorary acting "Sikong" title. He died in 791. He was posthumously created the Prince of Shanggu and given a number of other posthumous honors.

Yangzong Lake

Yangzonghai Lake () (given on some maps as Yangzong Sea, though it is fresh water) is located between Yiliang County, Chenggong District and Chengjiang County, 45 kilometers east of Kunming City in Yunnan Province, China. About 30,000 people rely on the Lake as their drinking water. Yangzonghai Lake is noted for its underwater springs and is one of several scenic areas in Yunnan province, which is known for its biodiversity. The lake is a popular resort destination for people living in the nearby provincial capital of Kunming, which itself borders Dianchi Lake, one of China's biggest freshwater lakes but also one of its most polluted. 
Pollution.
As recently as 2002, Yangzonghai had been noted for having water clean enough for drinking and swimming. But as of September 2008, it was officially considered unfit for drinking, swimming in or fishing in, when the provincial government announced high levels of arsenic in its waters. The arsenic contamination was discovered (in June 2008) when an inspection was made of enterprises operating in the Yangzonghai basin. Eight companies were found to have been engaged in illegal polluting practices. Yunnan Chengjiang Jinye Industrial and Trade Co Ltd (云南澄江锦业工贸有限公司) was named as the main polluter. The company allegedly failed to build the legally required treatment facility for its wastewater, with years of accumulated arsenic seeping into the local water table. It had been fined multiple times in the past, but the relatively small fines were viewed by the company as an extra cost of doing business. 
Yunnan Communist Party Secretary Bai Enpei (白恩培) and Yunnan Governor Qin Guangrong (秦光荣) have pledged to take "decisive action" to remedy the situation. In February 2008, Kunming Communist Party Secretary Qiu He (仇和) visited Yangzonghai, warning local enterprises that the lake must not become a "second Dianchi".
An article posted on xinhuanet.com, October 22, 2008 said: "Three executives of a company were arrested and 12 government officials fired in connection with polluting a lake in southwest China's Yunnan Province, according to a provincial inspection department spokesman on Wednesday. The executives were Li Dahong, chairman of the board of directors with Jinye Industry and Trade Co., Ltd., and Jin Dadong, director in charge of production in the company. The spokesman did not disclose the identity of the third executive. The 12 fired officials included Chen Zhifen, a vice mayor of Yuxi City, Yang Zhenqiang, assistant to the mayor, Fang Jianhua, director of the city environmental protection bureau, and two unnamed officials with the provincial water resources department. The others were removed from county-level government departments."
Cleanup project.
The Yunnan provincial government has initiated the "China Yunnan Yangzonghai Lake Water Pollution Reduction, Arsenic Removal and Water Quality Restoration" project in a bid to clean up the lake via the Yunnan Provincial Scientific and Technological Development Research Institute. The main objective of the project will be to reduce the amount of arsenic in Yangzonghai's waters from the current 0.128 grams/liter to 0.050 grams/liter within a three-year period.

Malcolm Allen (politician)

Malcolm Allen (born May 30, 1953) is a Canadian politician. He has represented the riding of Welland in the Canadian House of Commons since 2008 as a member of the New Democratic Party. He currently serves as Critic for Agriculture and Agri-Food in the Shadow Cabinet of the Official Opposition (Canada).
Early life and career.
Allen, born in Glasgow, Scotland, immigrated to Canada as a child in 1963. His father, a shipwright came over to Canada to work at the Collingwood shipyards. He would later to transfer to the Port Weller Drydocks located on the Welland Canal where Allen’s family would settle.
Allen holds an undergraduate degree in history and political science from Brock University (graduated in 1983). An electrician by trade, he served on the Executive Board of CAW local 199 from 1996 to 2000 as Recording Secretary and from 2000 to 2008 as Financial Secretary.
In 2004, Allen travelled to Africa to oversee the clearing of landmine sites and the construction of women’s co-ops as part of the Canadian Autoworkers, Canada Social Justice Fund committee.
In 2007 Allen spearheaded the creation of Genesis Court, a non-profit affordable housing complex with support services that would help people who were at risk to turn their lives around. Through the planning stages of Genesis court it would eventually become part of the Bethlehem Housing and Support Services organization, which includes Bethlehem Place.
Allen was also a member of the Pelham Library Board, the Golden Horseshoe Social Action Committee and the Niagara Health Coalition.
Pelham municipal politics.
Allen served on the Pelham Town Council from 2003 to 2008 representing Ward 1.
In 2006, he served as the town’s deputy mayor. He also chaired the Municipal Corporate Services Committee and served on it for five years.
Member of Parliament.
Allen was first elected to the House of Commons on October 14, 2008 to the 40th Parliament, defeating Conservative Alf Kiers and the Liberal incumbent, John Maloney.
During the 40th Parliament Allen served as the critic for Skills, Training and Apprenticeships and Food Safety and the deputy critic for Agriculture and Food Security (Canadian Food Inspection Agency). He also served for a period as New Democrat Caucus chair.
Allen was re-elected on May 2, 2011, beating Conservative Leanna Villella by over 1000 votes. Allen was one of 103 New Democrats elected, a record for the party and the first time in their history serving as the Official Opposition. Allen is currently the Critic for Agriculture and Agri-Food in Thomas Mulcair's Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (Canada).
Poppy Bill.
In November 2009, Allen introduced a private members bill intended to support the Royal Canadian Legion’s annual Poppy Campaign by eliminating the GST from the purchase of poppies and poppy wreaths. The taxing of poppies was estimated to cost Legions about $780,000 a year. The money raised by the legions in the Poppy Campaign is used for important services like dental care, replacing broken roofs, supporting meals-on-wheels programs and more. After almost a full year of pressure, both the Provincial Liberal Government and Federal Conservative Government finally agreed to remove each of their portions of the new HST (formerly PST and GST) from the poppy purchases. Canada's Legions now have approximately $780,000 more a year to operate their services.
Opposition to Homolka pardon.
In May 2010, Allen met with Talin French-Doyle, niece of Kristen French who presented him with a petition containing over 1,700 signatures asking for the government to create legislation to prevent Karla Homolka, who was involved in French's murder, from receiving a pardon. Under the law at the time, Homolka would have been eligible to apply for a pardon in the summer of 2010.
Allen introduced a Private Member's Bill that would have effectively fast tracked the portion of Bill C-23 (An Act to Amend The Criminal Records Act). This would have prevented the pardon, and allowed for proper debate of the remaining portion of the bill. When there was hesitation of the Government and Official Opposition sides to go through with Allen's Private Members Bill, he immediately offered it to the government to ensure that the right thing was done. It is because of this pressure that Allen was able to successfully negotiate a deal with Conservative Public Safety Minister Vic Toews to split the Bill C-23 into two bills and was able to fast-track the new Bill C-23a which barred Homolka from receiving a pardon. The bill was passed on the final sitting day of the House of Commons 2010 Winter Session, and Homolka did not receive a pardon.

Rosenfeld Effect

The Rosenfeld Effect is the empirical fact that electricity use per capita in California (CA) has been almost flat from 1973 to 2006, whereas use in the US has gone up 50%. The effect is attributed to energy efficiency, a cause pioneered by Arthur H. Rosenfeld.
A conference in 2006 at UC Berkeley was dedicated to the Rosenfeld Effect.
It is often associated with the following two charts:
The first graph is Figure 1 of the 2007 California Integrated Energy Policy Report and is sometimes referred to as the Rosenfeld Curve. The second is widely used in Powerpoint presentations.

<doc id="19790410" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19790410" title="Amoebic gill disease">
Amoebic gill disease

Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is a potentially fatal disease of some marine fish. It is caused by "Neoparamoeba perurans", the most important amoeba in cultured fish. It primarily affects farm raised fish of the Salmonidae family, most notably affecting the Tasmanian Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) industry, costing the A$20 million a year in treatments and lost productivity. Turbot, bass, bream, sea urchins and crabs have also been infected.
The disease has also been reported affecting the commercial salmon fisheries of the United States, Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain, Ireland and Chile. It was first diagnosed in the summer of 1984/1985 in populations of Atlantic Salmon off the east coast of Tasmania and was found to be caused by the "Neoparamoeba perurans" n.sp.
Clinical signs and diagnosis.
Symptoms typically begin to appear two months after the fish are transferred from freshwater hatcheries to open net sea cages. Symptoms include mucus build-up on the gills of infected fish and hyper-plastic lesions, causing white spots and eventual deterioration of the gill tissue. Fish will show signs of dyspnoea such as rapid opercular movements and lethargy. Although usually recognised by hyperplastic and proliferative gill lesions, the effects of AGD occur before oxygen transfer across the gill is severely compromised. AGD affected fish show a significant increase in vascular resistance contributing to cardiovascular collapse. Such effects result in compensatory changes in heart shape to improve its efficiency at pumping blood.
Contributing factors are an ambient water temperature above 16 degrees Celsius, crowding and poor water circulation inside the sea pens. Clinical cases are more common in the Summer. The lesions on the gills are highly suggestive of infection. Gill biopsies can be observed under the microscope for amoebas, or tested using fluorescent antibody testing.
Treatment and control.
Currently, the most effective treatment is transferring the affected fish to a freshwater bath for a period of 2 to 3 hours. This is achieved by towing the sea cages into fresh water, or pumping the fish from the sea cage to a tarp filled with fresh water. Mortality rates have been lowered by adding Levamisole to the water until the saturation is above 10ppm. Due to the difficulty and expense of treatment, the productivity of salmon aquaculture is limited by access to a source of fresh water. Chloramine and chlorine dioxide have also been used. Other potential in-feed treatments such as immunosupportive-based feeds, mucolytic compounds such as L-cysteine ethyl ester and the parasticide bithionol have been tested with some success although not developed for commercial use.

The University of Tennessee Athletic Council, chaired by Professor Nathan Dougherty, officially suspended varsity football during the World War I years of 1917 and 1918 because the majority of the players were called into military service. In addition, Coach John R. Bender was enlisted as an instructor at Camp John Sevier in Greenville, South Carolina.
During this period without varsity football, two unofficial teams were formed from Army recruits and students. One team represented a training unit called the Fighting Mechanics and the other team represented the Student Army Training Corps (SATC).

Kvalda is a Finnish jazz quartet. The members of the band are singer Aili Ikonen, pianist Antti Kujanpää, double bass player Jori Huhtala and drummer Hanne Pulli. Kvalda's music has been described as "Nordic", and is influenced by traditional music.
Kvalda was formed in Jyväskylä in the autumn of 2002 on Kujanpää's initiative. At that time, all the band's members were studying at the conservatory of Jyväskylä College. Another common factor for them was Jazz Bar (nowadays Poppari), a music club in Jyväskylä: Ikonen, Huhtala and Pulli were active participants in children's jam sessions arranged in Jazz Bar. The club later designated Kujanpää, Pulli and Ikonen as the musicians of the year and Huhtala as the newcomer of the year.
Kvalda's debut album "Kvalda" was published at Jyväskylä Summer Jazz festival on June 12, 2004. The album was recorded in Jyväskylä College's studio in May 2003 and March 2004. The songs on the album are composed by Ikonen, Kujanpää and Huhtala.
In May 2004 Kvalda won the Finnish preselection of the Young Nordic Jazz Comets band contest held in Umo Jazz House in Helsinki. They received a Renault Jazz Award and reached the finals of the contest, which was held in Stockholm in July of the same year. The band won the finals and started a concert tour in the Nordic countries.
The members of Kvalda have later moved to Helsinki to continue their musical studies: Kujanpää and Huhtala study in the jazz music department of the Sibelius Academy, Ikonen studies in the department of folk music and Pulli studies in the department of pop and jazz music of the Helsinki Polytechnic Stadia. Kvalda's second album, "Leia", was published by Texicalli Records in October 2007. All the band members have contributed songs to the album.
Kvalda has performed on several jazz festivals in Finland. In spring 2005, they were on a concert tour in Finland arranged by Finnish Jazz Federation. In addition, the band had concerts in the Northern countries, the Netherlands, the Chech Republic, Greece, and Germany. The members of Kvalda play also in many other musical groups.

Yakuza Girl – Blade Shikake no Hanayome

It has been licensed in French by Soleil Manga.
Story.
Set in modern day Japan on the grounds of Daihon Academy (Daihon Gakuen), the manga follows the protagonist Senguu Fumihiro as he enters the aforementioned academy, to find a wife and thus satisfy the wish of his grandmother (who wanted to see her great grandchildren before passing away). Of course, knowing absolutely nothing of what he sees as a top-level school, Fumihiro is caught completely off guard when he learns that technically every student and teacher of Daihon is in fact wielders of supernatural skills and powers. Worst however, is that the students, aggregated in "clans", are allowed to brutally murder each other - even their grades are based upon their enemies' death toll (i.e. the number of students of enemy clans they killed). In such an absurd scenario, Fumihiro's aid comes from Akari, the girl to whom he proposed when he saw her for the first time.
On a side note, one of the most peculiar features of Daihon, is a black, cylindrical tower that sits in what seems to be the center of the school compound, atop of which floats a black, translucent orb containing a World War II-era American B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber. As for now, it appears that the plane is way more than scenic display, and Fumihiro's newly acquired powers seems to be connected to the stasis-bound aircraft in more ways than one. It is later revealed in the final chapters of the series that the heavy bomber is actually the original Enola Gay, the WWII aircraft that would drop the Little Boy atomic bomb on Hiroshima. This event was stopped by the predecessor to Fumihiro's power of 'Cause and Effect', Major Narukawa, who trapped the aircraft in a sphere of frozen time. This divergence in the timestream resulted in the world of Yakuza Girl. Narukawa has remained inside the cylindrical tower until present day, all the while using his powers to keep the bomber frozen in time. Fumihiro, after manifesting his abilities, was chosen to be the successor of this responsibility.
Characters.
Senmetsu Clan.
Senguu Fumihiro - A boy who was raised by his grandmother in the country and a first year high school student, Fumihiro transfers to Daihon Academy to find a bride and fulfill his grandmother's wish of having great grandchildren before passing away. He proposed to Akari after finding her bathing in a spring, and since then has pursued the idea of her being his fated wife. Comprehensibly weak since he wielded no special powers whatsoever, he acquired a Shikigei from Reiko, a beauty mark under his right eye. Thought to be a completely useless one, his power actually allows him to completely freeze the flow of time, except for himself, for a short while. In chapter nine however, Reiko reveals that his power is the ability to interfere with the law of 'Cause and Effect', making him able to change and alter whatever he wishes. 
Senimaru Akari - A bespectacled girl who wields a katana and Fumihiro's classmate, Akari was initially assigned to protect Fumihiro after he transfers. She is cold towards most people except to Reiko, the leader of the clan Gusha Senmetsu (to which Fumihiro is assigned). Over time, she seems to have warmed up towards Fumihiro and is confused by why he wants her to be his bride. Not much is known of her past, other than that she was found by Reiko and since then adopted into her family, acquiring her surname in the process. Her Shikigei is under her left eye, but is described as "useless", and so far has never been used.
Arikawa Kotohiko - A bespectacled boy who is in the same class as Fumihiro, Kotohiko is cold towards Fumihiro but it has recently been shown that he cares a little bit about him, though he always appears as callous and frowning. His Shikigei, named "Mystletein", is located on his right hand and grants him the power to shoot little but high piercing bullets from his fingers. While using this power, his whole hand and arm up to his elbow turn into a cannon-like appendage. Also, he can shrink down said weapon to just a finger in cases where concealment is deemed necessary. 
Senimaru Reiko - Leader of the Gusha Senmetsu clan, she is an enigmatic third-year student who tends to regularly skip lessons and appears to smoke a lot. She wears odd eyepatch on her right eye, and has the biggest Shigikei of all her clan tattooed on a good portion of her breasts, neck and shoulders. She is the only one to accept at open arms Fumihiro, and after giving him the power of a Shikigei, kisses him passionately while addressing him as "her groom". Also, she admitted to have killed the former commander of her Clan before taking over. Her power takes the same name as her Clan, "Gusha Senmetsu"(Genocide of the Foolish), and takes the form of long, wicked-like barbed vines of amazing sharpness and strength that burst out from her chest. She is also capable of surviving fatal wounds and healing them completely. In chapter 6 Reiko used the same incense she used to kill the previous commander of Yaguruma to paralyze Senguu and sleep with him. In chapter 7 she is attacked by Tsuji of the Hakkou Ichiu Clan when her back is turned as she was talking to Akari; her wounds healed and she killed Tsuji with her chivalrous power "Gusha Senmetsu". She is later both raped and killed by Itagaki of the Hakkou Ichiu clan.
Mibu Akane - A second year student, Akane sports a very flashy dressing style, has a very muscular build and appears to enjoy fighting, so much so that she tends to get sexually aroused while fighting an opponent she finds strong enough. She also seems to be in a romantic relationship with fellow clan member Asukai Kagefumi, who tends to try to make money off her. Her Shikigei is on her left leg, but its powers are unknown.
Asukai Kagefumi - A second year student, Kagefumi looks younger than he is and is blunt. He seems to be in a romantic relationship with fellow clan member Mibu Akane, making her pose in awkward positions to earn money. His Shikigei is located behind his neck (though much of his power activates with his left eyeball which pops out of its socket before floating in front of him whenever he's activating his Shikigei), and has more than one ability, all of which seems to be named after different deities and myths from Ancient Egypt ("Udjat" and "Atum" being examples).
Kakimoto Rin - A second year student, of which practically nothing is known so far. She has the aesthetics of a child, always grinning and eating lots of sweets non stop. While her Shikigei is unknown, she is one of the strongest members of her clan.
Ohshikouchi Tomoe - A third year student, possibly the most ladylike of all the females of the Gusha Senmetsu clan. She has a cute, innocent appearance and dresses in a regal kimono, and her mannerism and speaking way are as well peaceful, almost serene. Along with Kakimoto Rin, she is one of the strongest of her clan.
Izumi Masakuni - He is a third year student by name, but by fact he is nothing more than a little cardboard box with short legs, wide open, cartoonish eyes and stretching, snake-like arms. He often is by Reiko's side, and supposedly was with her way before the beginning of the series.
Gourmet Clan.
Seabura Tarou - Leader of the Gourmet Clan, he is a towering, obese man obsessed with flesh as a source of power. He constantly eats, and his underlings appears to have his same habits, being all overweight and bald. His Shikigei, located on his head, turns him into a monstrous creature with a mouth similar to that of a crown of tentacles of a cephalopod and several tentacles on his back. His power, named "Lard Paradise", allows him to fire concentrated jets of sticky, quickly-hardening grease. He was defeated by Akari, who hit him with such force that she forced all the grease in Tarou's body to melt. He tried to retaliate (and revealed himself as quite a fine-looking boy without his fat around) and kill Reiko, but was killed by Akari.
Dai Yaguruma Clan.
Yuugao & Asagao - Two brutal, sadistic twins sent as a vanguard before the storm of the entire Dai Yaguruma Clan. Yuugao is the male of the pair, and often calls his sister Asagao "Nee-chan". Obsessed with love and the supposed power they got from it, they attacked the Gusha Senmetsu dormitory but were easily repelled by Akane and Kotohiko. While Yuugao was beaten, and supposedly killed, Asagao met her demise at her own hands, killing herself and using her own viscera as a flare to signal the beginning of her Clan's attack. Yuugao and Asagao's Shikigei, named "Hana to Hebi", are symmetrical, and are located on the right and left elbow respectively (resembling a pair of eyes while activating): Yuugao's one is a contorted, barbed spear, while Asago's is a deformed shield shaped similarly to a cobra's head.
Yaguruma Suzumushi - Leader of the Dai Yaguruma Clan, she appears to have a bitter rivalry with Reiko. Most of her underlings refer to her as "aneki" (term for "older sister"). This comes from the fact that all of her Clan are blood related, as the offspring of Yaguruma all come from incest. Suzumushi herself is the top-notch "missile" of her Clan, and her Shikigei takes form of a pair of enormous blade-like wings that sprout from her head. She stormed the Gusha Senmetsu dormitory in hope to have her match with Reiko, only to find her sleeping soundly, oblivious of the mayhem. In the end she was unsuccessful again, and was punished and carried away, hand shackled, with her underlings, under the supervision of the school's chairman.
Hakkou Ichiu Clan.
This clan is considered to be the most dangerous of all, not only due to having the highest count of members among all other clans, but also the most powerful and influential ones as well. 
Itagaki - Commander of the Hakkou Ichiu, he is an extremely beautiful, almost androgynous third-year student. Under his facade of grace and finesse he is an arrogant and sadistic tyrant that, as he himself boasts, "loves to look down on others". He appears to enjoy drinking tea. His motivations and his Shikigei are by now unknown.
Tsuji - One of the bodyguards of Itagaki, she is presented as exceptionally strong, to the point of mauling an enormous Kronosaurus with just one hand (and posing for victory soon after, as a demonstration of her clan's power). She later attacked Akari, revealing that her power sits in her right leg, capable of morphing in an array of weapons such as a blade and a bow. She was brutally slaughtered by Reiko.
Daihon Discipline Committee.
The Discipline Committee is not a Clan "per se", as its duty is to prevent the students from escaping Daihon grounds. They all seem to wield Shikigeis. 
Mikoshiba Kaoru - Leader of the ninth unit of the Committee, she has a very stern, almost masculine personality, completely unforgiving even with her own underlings, even more so with those who break the rules. She appeared briefly, slaughtering two of her henchmen caught while trying to rape Akari, and proceeded to brutally torture Akari herself when she took the blame for Fumihiro's escape. She almost killed her, but instead let Fumihiro take the blame by making him sign with his own blood an oath to never try to flee again, otherwise condemning him to a grisly, suffering death. Her Shikigei is located on her neck, and its power is known as "Kuroibara", with which Kaoru's legs change into a mass of black, thorn-covered, blade-ending tentacles. As it has been suggested by a brief conversation between Kaoru and her Shikigei, she herself has some gruesome memory of Daihon, as the tattoo was surprised that she "let those two go so easily".
Persona non Grata.
This term is used to describe individuals who wish to undo the world of Yakuza Girl and replace it with another. The Hakkou Ichiu Clan wishes to replace it with their own ideal 'world of unity', in which they control all the Shikigei powers and the various clans are united under them. American bureaucrat Ackroyd, however, wishes to revert the world back to its original form, the world where Little Boy is successfully dropped on Hiroshima.
Ackroyd - An American bureaucrat who appears to be associated with Katsuhara, the founder of Daihon Academy, and Major Narukawa. He wishes to free the Enola Gay from the frozen time created by the Major so it can fulfill its mission of dropping the Little Boy atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
Powers.
Chivalrous Power - Supernatural powers which usually takes the shape of appendages or mutations made for combat, be it offensive or defensive or support. They often turn their wielder into bizarre, if not monstrous shapes. Others, however, affect or alter the user's immediate surroundings rather than the user's body itself
Shikigei - Coming from the words "Shiki" (Shikigami) and "gei" (Tattoo), it is the source from which the Chivalrous Powers come from. They manifest as tattoo of various patterns unique to the one who wields the Chivalrous Power to activate them. Each tattoo tends to grow and spread on its host's body, and appears to have a mind on its own (some have shown the ability to talk and reason with their wielders). While releasing its power, a Shikigei shows a reptilian eye in its center. It has been implied that the size of the Shikigei tattoo on its user's person, while in an inactive state, indicates the scope of power the yakuza can reach.

ICON A5

The ICON A5 is an American amphibious light-sport aircraft being developed by ICON Aircraft. A concept aircraft was flown in 2008, and the creation of the production tooling started in December 2012.
Design.
The A5 is a high-wing flying boat-type amphibious monoplane with a carbon fiber airframe and retractable undercarriage. It seats two people in an enclosed cockpit and is powered by a single Rotax 912 iS engine driving a three-bladed pusher propeller. Dornier-style sponsons provide hydrodynamic stability, housing the retracted main landing gear, and act as a step for crew and passenger. The wings can be folded aft for ground transport and storage. Equipment includes an angle of attack indicator, an unusual feature in general aviation aircraft. An airframe ballistic parachute is optional.
Development.
A prototype was constructed in 2007-2008 and made its first flight in July 2008. In January 2009 the company announced completion of the first phase (27 flights) of a three-phase testing program, including water-handling. In February 2009, the prototype entered the second-phase testing to refine aerodynamic and handling qualities. In 2011, an updated "spin-resistant" wing was flight tested, and finished by February 2012. The design meets FAR Part 23 type certified requirements by employing a cuffed wing with multiple proprietary airfoils which change along the wing's span. Lotus Engineering USA replaced BMW DesignworksUSA the same year to develop an "automotive style" aircraft interior and assist with development of lightweight component manufacturing.
In July 2012 the company applied for an Federal Aviation Administration LSA rule exemption to raise the weight of the A5 above the maximum weight for amphibian LSAs, citing that the required structure to make the aircraft spin resistant necessitated a gross weight of . In May 2013 the FAA requested more details on the procedures used by Icon to test the spin resistance of the aircraft at the higher weight. The FAA also requested a signed statement from the company indicating that the aircraft meets the spin resistance criteria specified for light aircraft type certification in FAR 23.221 (a)(2). In July 2013 the FAA granted the weight increase.
Production delivery dates have been adjusted from initial estimates. In June 2011 the company announced that it had procured an additional investment, which was "needed to allow the company to complete engineering development work and enter production - possibly as early as next year ." By August 2011, the company stated that it had sold positions for 694 A5s, up from 400 initially sold at AirVenture 2009. A promotion in conjunction with EAA Young Eagles raised over for Young Eagles.
On August 6, 2012, Icon announced that Cirrus Aircraft would produce composite airframe components for the A5 at its Grand Forks, North Dakota facility. The airframe parts will be shipped to Icon's Tehachapi, California plant for final assembly. In August 2012 the first production aircraft was anticipated for delivery in mid-2013 against 850 customer orders that company says it held at that point.
On June 20, 2013, the company announced that it had organized production funding of over US$60 million, with final funds being provided by a Chinese investor.
By July 30, 2013, the estimated production price had risen to US$189,000, from the company's initial estimated price established in 2008 of US$139,000.
On October 2, 2013, the construction of production tooling was announced, which "will lead up to the assembly of the first pre-production aircraft to be completed in mid-2014".
Awards.
In the 2009 IDEA/BusinessWeek Design Awards, ICON was awarded Gold in the Transportation Design category. The competition included all cars, motorcycles, watercraft, and every other motor vehicle designed in 2008. ICON was also awarded a 2009 Gold Spark Design Award and a Design Distinction in ID Magazine's Annual Design Review.

Prairie Mission

Prairie Mission, also known as the Prairie Mission School and Prairie Institute, was a historic African American school in the community of Prairie, Alabama. The school is the only survivor of the six original Presbyterian mission schools that once operated in Wilcox County. It was placed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on July 22, 1991 and subsequently on the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 2001, due its significance to African American history.
History.
The school was founded as a mission of the Freedmen’s Board of the United Presbyterian Church of North America in 1894. Classes for as many as 300 African American children, in grades 1–9, were held at the school up until the 1950s. After that time, students in grades 7–9 were sent to the mission school in nearby Millers Ferry. The school was discontinued in the late 1960s, coinciding with the end of segregation in Alabama public schools.
Architecture.
The school campus originally included the school building, a Presbyterian church, two dormitories, and a two-story principal's house. Although the dormitories have been demolished, the school building, the church, and the principal's house remain intact. The school building and church are owned and maintained by the Presbyterians of Wilcox County group. The principal's house is privately owned.
The school building is a large one-story structure with a pyramidal hipped roof. The front (north) elevation is six bays wide, with the central four bays projecting forward of the main facade. These four bays, containing two windows and two entrance doors, are topped by a gabled roof, which in turn is crowned with a small belfry. The entrance doors are each sheltered under a projecting shed roof supported by brackets. All of the original windows have been replaced with smaller, more modern, versions. The side elevations both have six bays, originally with five windows and one door on each side. The rear elevation features a projecting gabled ell and a smaller shed room. The interior is divided by a central assembly room that is flanked on both sides by two classrooms.
The church building, reworked in the mid-20th century, features a front-gabled main auditorium four bays deep. The front gable features a small arched window and a decorative gable bracket. The building is entered through a corner bell tower with a pyramidal roof.

David Eccles School of Business

The David Eccles School of Business is located on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City, Utah. The school was first established in 1896.
History.
In 1896 University of Utah business education was part of the Economics and Sociology Department. The needs to expand academic offerings lead the University of Utah to establish the School of Commerce and Finance in 1917. In its first year, 126 students enrolled, over the next 80 years the enrollment figure increased over 25 times. Today, the David Eccles School of Business educates nearly 3,500 students in four departments of study.
In 1927, the name of the school was changed to "School of Business" and course divisions included Accounting, Distribution and Production, Finance, and Economics. In 1933, the first graduate degrees were awarded. The School of Business was officially accredited by the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business in August 1936. In 1955, the MBA program was instituted at the School of Business. The School's first MBA degrees were awarded in 1957, and its departments were reorganized to Accounting, Finance, Management, and Marketing.
In 1991, the School of Business was named the David Eccles School of Business in honor of David Eccles, who founded 48 businesses in various sectors throughout Utah, Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming during the latter part of the 19th century. A $15 million endowment was given by Eccles youngest daughter, Emma Eccles Jones, to honor her late father's legacy.
Campus.
University of Utah Central Campus is located on the bench of the Rocky Mountains. The geographic location is situated between numerous ski resorts and five national parks.
The David Eccles School of Business is located on the south end of Central Campus. Current business facilities include the Kendall D. Garff Building (KDGB),and the C. Roland Christensen Center (CRCC).
The school has now completed the first phase of a two phase project that will replace the KDGB building. The new buildings will feature more classrooms, better access to technology, and efficient energy solutions. The target for completing the second phase of the project is 2013.
Academics.
Eccles' programs also include a 21-month weekend-based Executive MBA program for working professionals with an average minimum of 13 years of full-time work, and a 24-month weeknights-based Professional MBA program for those with a minimum average of nine years of full-time work experience. The EMBA program was rated 33rd in the U.S. by the October 2011 Financial Times, and 25th in the U.S. by Business Week.

<doc id="19790637" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19790637" title="Home fuel cell">
Home fuel cell

A home fuel cell, one of the available technologies for micro combined heat and power (microCHP) or microgeneration, is a residential-scaled energy system. A home fuel cell is an alternative energy technology that increases efficiency by simultaneously generating power and heat from one unit, on-site within a home. This allows a residence to reduce overall fossil fuel consumption, reduce carbon emissions and reduce overall utility costs, while being able to operate 24 hours a day.
Combined heat and power (CHP) fuel cells have demonstrated superior efficiency for years in industrial plants, universities, hotels and hospitals. Residential and small-scale commercial fuel cells are now becoming available to fulfill both electricity and heat demand from one system. Fuel cell technology in a compact system converts natural gas, propane, and eventually biofuels—into both electricity and heat, producing carbon dioxide (and small amounts of NOx) as exhaust. In the future, new developments in fuel cell technologies will likely allow these power systems to run off of biomass instead of natural gas, directly converting a home fuel cell into a renewable energy technology.
Uses.
Most home fuel cells fit either inside a mechanical room or outside a home or business, and can be discreetly sited to fit within a building's design. The system operates like a furnace, water heater, and electricity provider—all in one compact unit. Some of the newer home fuel cells can generate anywhere between —optimal for larger homes ( or more), especially if pools, spas ,and radiant floor heating are in plans. Other uses include sourcing of back-up power for essential loads like refrigerator/freezers, electronics/computers, and wine cellars.
Deploying the system’s heat energy efficiently to a home or business' hot water applications displaces the electricity or gas otherwise burned to create that heat, which further reduces overall energy bills. Retail outlets like fast food chains, coffee bars, and health clubs gain operational savings from hot water heating.
Environmental Impacts.
Because fuel cells generate electricity and heat on site, the chemical conversion of hydrocarbon fuels into energy is substantially more efficient than comparable grid-connected systems and heating by burning fuel. Fuel cells provide a significant net reduction in CO2—about one-third lighter carbon footprint is possible when both heat and electricity are used. The system also reduces other harmful emissions produced by burning fuel at conventional power or heat generation sources. The lower carbon footprint supports many state goals and initiatives to address climate change impacts.
Installation.
Home fuel cells are designed and built to fit in either an interior mechanical room or outside—running quietly in the background 24/7. Connected to the utility grid through the home’s main service panel and using net metering, the home fuel cells easily integrate with existing electrical and hydronic systems and are compliant with utility interconnection requirements. In the event of grid interruption the system automatically switches to operate in a grid-independent mode to provide continuous backup power for dedicated circuits in the home while the grid is down. It can also be modified to run off-the-grid, if desired.
Current installations.
Twenty companies have installed Bloom Energy fuel cells in their buildings, including Google, eBay, and FedEx. The eBay CEO said to "60 Minutes", that they have saved $100,000 in electricity bills in the 9 months they have been installed.[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/18/60minutes/main6221135.shtml
Oregon-based ClearEdge Power has installations of its 5 kW system at the home of Jackie Autry, Bay Area Wealth Manager Bruce Raabe and VC investor Gary Dillabough.
Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.
Cost.
Most home fuel cells are comparable to residential solar energy photovoltaic systems on a dollar per watt-installed basis. Home fuel cells can generate eight times more energy per year than the same size solar installation, even in the best solar locations. For example, a 5 kW home fuel cell produces about 80 MWh of annual combined electricity and heat, compared to approximately 10MWh generated by a 5 kW solar system. However, these systems are not directly comparable because solar power is a renewable resource and natural gas is not.
Operating costs for home fuel cells can be as low as 6.0¢ per kWh based on $1.20 per therm for natural gas, assuming full electrical and heat load utilization.
Solar panels have minimal operation cost because they only occasionally need to be cleaned.
Incentives.
In the U.S.A., home fuel cells are eligible for substantial incentives and rebates at both the state and federal levels as a part of renewable energy policy. For example, the California Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) rebate ($2,500 per kW) and Federal Tax Credits ($1,000 per kW residential and $3,000 per kW commercial) will significantly reduce the net capital cost to the customer. For businesses, additional cash advantages can be realized from bonus and accelerated depreciation of fuel cells.
In addition, home fuel cells receive net metering credit in many service areas for any excess electricity generated, but not used, by putting it back on the utility grid.
The Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE) provides comprehensive information on state, local, utility, and federal incentives that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.
California.
In California in particular, utilities charge higher per kWh rates as energy consumption rises above established baselines – with the top tier set at the highest rates to discourage consumption at those levels. Home fuel cells reduce customer exposure to the top tier rates, saving homeowners as much as 45% in reduced annual energy costs.
Market Status.
Home fuel cells is a new market and represents a fundamental shift in the sourcing of energy. An individual home fuel cell system installed in a US home becomes a part of the bigger picture of U.S. energy independence. An ultimate benefit of home fuel cells will be to eventually create networks of micro-CHP systems distributed throughout communities and business parks. This self-generation of energy in a distributed generation approach that will secure and increase US power generating capacity, enabling unused electricity to be sent back to the grids without having to add new power plants and transmission lines. Putting a home fuel cell system into homes has the potential to get people off-the-grid, play a significant role in energy efficiency, and reduce US dependence on foreign energy imports.

Paris Decorators Corporation

The Paris Decorators Corporation was founded in 1911 and operated a chain of nine furnishing stores in the metropolitan New York City area. The business specialized in curtains, interior decoration products, draperies, and furniture. It was based in Newark, New Jersey but maintained its general office and factory at 28 West 23rd Street. Among its principal competitors in the 1930s retail business was Mrs. Dodd, Inc., located in Manhattan.
Company history.
In July 1933 the Paris Decorators Corporation doubled its Broad Street space. The property ran from 23 "-" 30 West 23rd Street through to 22nd Street. It crossed through space leased by the Rosenberg-Murray Company and Harry Theons & Co. The company discontinued making purchases in Germany in September 1933, and closed its German office at the same time. This was because of the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler and the beginning of the repressive Third Reich regime.
In 1936, the company's president, Gabriel Haber, appointed the Franklin Bruck Advertising Agency to handle its account. It was then that the firm first began to advertise in newspapers. A campaign was launched employing three New York City newspapers and direct mailing.
On August 20, 1937 the Rosenberg, Murray Company, Inc., negotiated the lease of of space at 151-63 West 26th Street, for the Paris Decorators Corporation. The property included two floors.
Herbert Lloyd Jay was appointed advertising and promotion manager for the company effective February 1, 1948. In April 1948 the retailer leased a floor at 245 West 67th Street.
Following the 1953 Christmas holiday season, Paris Decorators introduced a new polish which could be used on wood and leather portions of furniture. It was effective in removing spots from surfaces. It was sold at the chain's location at 417 Fifth Avenue, among others.
The retailer leased its warehouse, which measured , to Mancony Warehouses, Inc., in August 1960. The lessee was a subsidiary of the B. Manichewitz Company. The deal for the 2200 Folin Street warehouse was brokered by Goldberg-Kornspun Associates, Inc. The title was insured by the Title Guarantee Company.

International Aid Transparency Initiative

The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) is a global campaign to create transparency in the records of how aid money is spent. The initiative hopes to thereby ensure that aid money reaches its intended recipients. The ultimate goal is to improve standards of living worldwide and globally reduce poverty.
History.
The initiative was launched on September 4, 2008, at a High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Accra, Ghana. The goal of the forum was to refocus attention worldwide on the steps needed to reach the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. It was presented by the United Kingdom's Secretary of International Development Douglas Alexander; along with Kemal Dervis, Head of the United Nations Development Programme; James Musconi, the Rwandan finance minister; and Kumi Naidoo, then president of CIVICUS. Mr. Alexander recommended creating a common set of openness standards by which donors can be judged. 14 international donors pledged to expand transparency as a result, and an agreement was reached to develop a common format for the release of aid information by 2010. A statement was issued by the signatories, which formally accepted the policies set forth in the Accra Agenda for Action and agreed to form the IATI. The text of the statement suggests that aid donors should:
The statement was agreed to by a variety of international donors, including the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, Irish Aid, the World Bank, the UK's Department for International Development, the United Nations Development Program, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
After a period of widespread engagement of donors, governments and NGOs and consultation on the information to be shared, and how it should be shared, the IATI Standard was agreed on 9 February 2011 in Paris.
At the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan, Korea in November 2011, the Initiative received continued support. In the run up to the forum, over 19 donors, including 12 government and multilateral donors, and a number of small NGOs, started publishing information on their aid projects using the IATI Standard [http://www.aidtransparency.net].
Make Aid Transparent Campaign.
On 8 June 2011, the Make Aid Transparent Campaign was launched, supported by over 60 organisations [http://makeaidtransparent.org/about.htm from North and South.
IATI Standard and Registry.
The IATI Standard combines a list of the information that donors publishing data as part of the Initiative should seek to publish, along with an XML Schema and collection of code lists for representing that information as structured open data. Donors publishing data using the standard are encouraged to submit meta-data to the IATI Registry [http://www.iatiregistry.org which lists the available data.
The IATI Standard succeeds two previous standardisation efforts for aid activity information: the Common Exchange Format for Development Activities CEFDA (developed from 1991), and International Development Markup Language IDML (developed from 1998) and used by Development Gateway as part of the data transfer standard in the AidData database.

History.
The Wadsworth Center, originally the New York State's Antitoxin Laboratory, was established in 1901. Its mission was to standardize and manufacture antitoxin, which was for the treatment of communicable diseases such as diphtheria and anthrax. In 1914, the Antitoxin Laboratory was designated the Division of Laboratories and Research. At the same time, Augustus B. Wadsworth was named director and he served until 1945.
Today.
The Wadsworth Center has over 100 principal investigators and more than 1,000 staff in four locations, the Biggs Laboratory (at the Empire State Plaza), the David Axelrod Institute (on New Scotland Avenue), the Center for Medical Science, and, in nearby Guilderland, New York, the Griffin Laboratory. Scientists at the Wadsworth Center study public health issues, such as drug resistance to emerging infections, environmental exposures, and basic biological processes that contribute to human health and disease.
Additionally, as the state's public health reference laboratory, the Wadsworth Center is responsible for responding to public health threats, developing methods to detect microbes and genetic disorders, measuring and analyzing environmental chemicals, and licensing clinical and environmental laboratories. In conjunction with the University at Albany, SUNY, the Wadsworth Center has training programs for undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral fellows.
Master of Science in Laboratory Science program.
Recently, the center developed a new avenue to train the public health laboratory workforce of tomorrow - The Wadsworth Center Master of Science in Laboratory Science program.

United States Post Office (Riverhead, New York)

Riverhead Post Office is a United States post office located at 1210 West Main Street in Riverhead, New York. It serves the ZIP code 11901, covering all of Riverhead, along with Roanoke, Reeves Park, Centerville, northern Jamesport, and northwestern Laurel.
The old Riverhead Post Office was designed by Louis A. Simon who was Supervising Architect for the United States Treasury Department. Simon also designed the Post Office buildings in Bay Shore, Northport, and Westhampton Beach. According to the Riverhead Town Historian, the land for the Post Office was purchased in 1932, with the building erected in 1935 and dedicated in November of that year. The post office was a depression-era public works project. It is built in a simplified Colonial Revival style.
As with Patchogue and Smithtown's Village of the Branch, Riverhead Post Office was known as a source for obscure postal denominations by Long Island-based stamp collectors. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

The Danish Landsting election of 1947 was held on 11 April 1947, with the exceptions that the electors were elected on 1 April 1947, that the candidates elected by the resigning parliament were elected on 7 March, and that the Faroese member was elected on 26 March.
Of the seven constituencies the seats representing constituencies number one (Copenhagen), four (Odense and Svendborg County), six (Hjørring, Aalborg, Thisted, Viborg and Randers County) and seven (the Faroe Islands) were up for election.
John Christmas Møller attributed the decline of his party—the Conservative People's Party—to his position regarding Southern Schleswig and resigned as parliamentary group leader as a consequence.

Winter Garden at Exposition Hall

The Winter Garden at Exposition Hall was a multi-purpose facility, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was designed by Joseph Stillburg. It stood on the current site of Point State Park. The facility consisted of three building: Main Hall, Music Hall and Machinery Hall. The Exposition was originally supposed to be a place for social gatherings where ideas and goods could be freely exchanged. However the facility later became Pittsburgh's primer indoor ice hockey rink.
History.
Origins.
In 1885, Western Pennsylvania Exposition Society, commonly called the Pittsburgh Exposition Society, was organized. During this era international expositions, state and county fairs and municipal expositions were very common. In fact, the Exposition Society was an outgrowth of an association that conducted the earlier expositions on the city's North Shore, on the spot where Exposition Park, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates until , stood. The society was a non-profit-sharing organization, having been established by public-spirited citizens for the benefit of the community. The Pittsburgh Exposition, were determined to have a venue that offered the feel of a county fair with the mystique of a World's Fair. A year after the society formed, the Pittsburgh City Council approved the purchase of land at the city's Point, along the shore of the Allegheny River. Exposition lifetime memberships and popular subscriptions raised nearly $1 million to complete the facility's construction. The city then granted the organization a 50-year lease.
Expositions.
The first Exposition took place in September 1889 and was open to both Pittsburgh and out-of-state residents. The facility had a daily average attendance of 10,000 during the fall months, visitors were attracted to the automobile, poultry and trade shows, while others gathered to enjoy the best orchestras and bands in the nation. Victor Herbert and John Phillip Sousa both played at the Exposition. Meanwhile fashion shows from New York and Paris attracted high society women, while free samples of balloons, popcorn and dairy products captured the attention of ordinary citizens. Finally, a roller coaster, ferris wheel and merry-go-round help lure the children of the western Pennsylvania to the facility. The complex had of exhibit space, an art gallery and the Music Hall that held 5,500 patrons. People travelled from great distances to join the locals; many wealthy patrons travelled up the Mississippi and Ohio rivers to moor their houseboats along the Allegheny's shore behind the Exposition site. Over the years the annual exhibitions were the most successful in the country. 
However disaster struck the Exposition in 1901, when the complex was destroyed by a fire on St. Patrick's Day. The fire was caused by wind-blown embers from a nearby stable fire. The blaze engulfed the great Main Hall, leaving Machinery Hall the only survivng building on the six acre site. Most of the Exposition was rebuilt at a cost of $600,000 and included new versions of Machinery Hall, the Main Hall and the Music Hall. The new Main Hall was constructed of steel, stone and massive brick walls. The Main Hall's heavy doors were adorned with cut white stone and the interior was decorated and illuminated by 1,500 incandescent lights under a vaulted and girdered ceiling. However by 1910, other cities that had been holding expositions dropped out of the field, but the Pittsburgh Exposition Society held on. Even while during the last decade, public interest in such affairs was declining, the society secured large attendance every year by increasing the facility's musical attractions by booking the greatest orchestras and bands of the country. The last exposition was held in the fall of 1916. On this occasion, the receipts fell off from the average of about $30,000, and the returns did not pay the expenses of the season. Over the next two years, hosting an exposition was deemed impossible, due to World War I and a polio epidemic.
Move to the ice.
Around 1914, public interest in ice skating was growing in Pittsburgh and that interest served was the focus for converting the Main Hall into the Winter Garden. Hockey was a growing sport in Pittsburgh and had been played at the Duquesne Gardens, which was located in the city's Oakland neighborhood. However ice time at the Gardens was scarce while the demand for hockey was growing. In 1915, chiller pipes and concrete were added to the floor of the Main Hall to create an impressive ice surface. The Winter Garden used the latest technology to produce hard, dry ice. The refrigeration plant was located in Machinery Hall almost 500 feet away and circulated a brine solution through 125,000 feet of pipe below the ice surface. The ice-making system used the latestest technology and pumped an ice-making solution at a rate of 15,000 gallons every minute to produce a minus 30 temperature on the floor.
In 1915, Arthur Sixsmith became the manager of the Winter Garden's hockey team. The team was based at the Winter Garden. However, the team only lasted one season, before disbanding in 1916. Meanwhile Roy Schooley, the manager of the Duquesne Gardens, began putting together his "Duquesne Garden hockey team". A feud soon began between the two clubs. The Duquesne and Winter Garden teams each played out-of-town opponents, often on the same night, and in direct competition of one another. Many of the other teams that used the Winter Garden were members of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, which included teams such as the Pittsburgh Keystones, Pittsburgh Duquesne and Pittsburgh Lyceum used the Winter Garden for matches. Soon after one of Pittsburgh's earliest women's league formed at the Winter Garden. The size of the playing surface used for the Exposition's hockey games was x and was bigger than today's international size rinks. By comparison, today's National Hockey League rinks measure x . The increased size wore down visiting opponents and heavily favored the home teams. On January 23, 1916, the Winter Garden hockey team played a two-game series against the Sudbuy All-Stars, who were considered to be one of the best teams in Canada. The Winter Garden team defeated Sudbury, 2-0, in the first game. During the opening game, the Sudbury players were reportedly overwhelmed by the size of the Garden's ice surface. However, the Winter Garden team would go on to drop the series' second game to Sudbury, 3-1.
On March 24, 1917, the biggest hockey match in the Winter Garden's history took place, featuring Hobey Baker. A star football and hockey player from Princeton, Baker and an all-star group of amateur hockey players from Philadelphia played against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team would go on to defeat Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3-2, with Baker scoring all three Philadelphia goals. Baker's goal tally included the game winner in the third overtime period. However, this would be the final hockey game and goal of Baker's career. He later died in France during a routine military flight, weeks after World War I ended. The last local hockey match at the Winter Garden, was played in the spring of 1920.
Creation of Point State Park.
The society in March 1919, voted to accept $360,000 from the city and give up the remaining 17 years of its 50-year lease of the city ground on which the buildings were located. During those next 17 years, the buildings with the lease would revert to the city anyhow, but the sale will enable the Society to pay its debts. Any money left over was to be divide among the men who invested their money in the institution. Pittsburgh's mayor, Edward V. Babcock, negotiated for the purchase of the Society's rights, to lease the main buildings for a union trolley freight station, and to use machinery hall for a city garage and machine shop, while the music hall could still be used for conventions and mass meetings. The final transaction by the society was made that March, when the lifetime managers and members of the society met in the auditorium of the Chamber of Commerce and unanimously decided to sell the holdings to the city for no less than 360,000. Local businessman, Henry J. Heinz was the last elected president of the society. 
An final agreement of the sale of the Exposition property was reported in the April 9, 1920 edition of the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"; however, a transfer was never finalized. Pittsburgh city council agreed to lease and used the Expo property for the city's auto pound. The lease ended 20 years later in 1934. The Music Hall was demolished in 1941 and Machinery Hall was dismantled in 1942 to secure scrap metal for the war effort. The Main Hall was the last remaining building until 1951 when the structure was torn down to make way for the Point State Park.

Scott Apel

D. Scott Apel is an American author and media critic. He is famous for his analyses of the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick and the television series "The Prisoner".
Apel hosted a rebroadcast of "The Prisoner" on San Jose public television station KTEH in the mid-1980s. He compiled a new order of progression for the series' episodes based on extensive analysis, one which is considered by many to be definitive. He likens the series' structure to that of a three-act play. Apel's commentary on the themes of The Prisoner notes the show's possible interpretations from Jungian psychology, Platonic philosophy, and Joseph Campbell's "journey of the hero".
Apel was friends with science fiction author Philip K. Dick. He was editor of "The Dream Connection", a book which contained transcripts of an interview Apel held with Dick, as well as a letter written to from Dick to Apel. Apel was also interviewed for the documentary film "The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick".
Apel has published some works of fiction, and was formerly a movie columnist for the "San Jose Mercury News".

"Jivin' in Be-Bop" is a 1947 musical film. It was produced by William D. Alexander and stars Dizzy Gillespie and His Orchestra, which included notable musicians such as bassist Ray Brown, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, and pianist John Lewis. The film also features singers Helen Humes and Kenny "Pancho" Hagood, Master of Ceremonies Freddie Carter, and a group of dancers.
The film consists of a plotless revue presented in a theatrical setting, offering a total of 19 musical and dance numbers. Gillespie and his band are shown performing eight songs, including "Salt Peanuts", "One Bass Hit", "Oop Bop Sh'Bam", and "He Beeped When He Should Have Bopped". The band plays off-camera while dancers perform during the remaining songs, which include "Shaw 'Nuff", "A Night in Tunisia", "Grosvenor Square", and "Ornithology".
The liner notes that accompany the DVD release suggest the tracks were prerecorded. One of Gillespie's biographers confirms this, although at least one critic believes the musicians were playing live.
The dancing in the film has been described as "dull and frequently silly" by writer Phil Hall, who wrote that "Jivin' in Be-Bop" includes "one of the worst ballets ever put on film".
Gillespie's dancing, on the other hand, is generally praised. One writer said "his unique technique is shown to great effect" in the film. One biographer described Gillespie "skipping about the stage", and another wrote that Gillespie was "quite happy to dance to the band's sounds, ... spinning around and mugging in front of the band".
Between the songs, Carter tells jokes and banters with Gillespie. Film historian Donald Bogle described the comic routines as "dull-witted". Bogle went on: "There are only two redeeming factors here: namely Dizzy Gillespie and vocalist Helen Humes. Otherwise the proceedings are pretty dreary."
Home video release.
A 1993 video, "Things to Come", included the eight on-screen performances by Gillespie and the band from "Jivin' in Be-Bop", together with some numbers from another Alexander-produced musical, "Rhythm in a Riff", which featured Billy Eckstine.
"Jivin' in Be-Bop" was released on DVD in 2004. The between-song banter between Carter and Gillespie was cut. According to one reviewer, the DVD was produced from a badly damaged print, which made portions of the film "unwatchable".

Drupeggio

Drupeggio (also known as Canaiolo bianco) is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Central Italy wine regions of Tuscany and Orvieto. The grape is often confused for the white Tuscan variety Vernaccia di San Gimignano, which is also known under the synonym "Canaiolo bianco" and maybe counted as one in the same in field blends.
Drupeggio is a permitted variety in several "Denominazione di origine controllata" (DOC)s including Orvieto in Umbria where it is usually blended with Trebbiano, Verdello, Grechetto and Malvasia Toscana and in the red and "rosé" wines of Barco Reale di Carmignano where it can blended with Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is also a permitted variety for use in Vin Santo production but the grape's limited ability to raisin sufficiently for use in straw wine production makes its appearance in these Italian dessert wines very rare.
History.
The first recorded mention of Drupeggio was in Tuscany under it is synonym Canaiolo bianco where it was recorded being used in wine production as early as 1817. Unlike the pink-skinned grape variety Canaiolo rosa, Canaiolo bianco is not a color mutation of the red Tuscan wine grape Canaiolo that can be used in the blended wines of Chianti. The exact origins of the variety is not known but DNA profiling completed in 2011 show that at least six different white grape varieties growing in Tuscany have been variously labeled as being Canaiolo bianco—the most notable being the Vernaccia di San Gimignano variety that is widely used in the "Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita" (DOCG) of the same name. Other varieties that are sometimes confused with Drupeggio include Vermentino and the virtually extinct Tuscan variety of Zuccaccio.
Viticulture.
Drupeggio is a mid to late ripening grape variety. With relatively thick skins for a white grape variety, Druppeggio berries tend not to raisin very easily which makes it use in the production of "passito" or straw wines, such as Vin Santo, very rare even though it is a permitted variety in several DOCs for the dessert wine. While several grape varieties, particularly in Tuscan, are known under the synonym of "Canaiolo bianco", the clone "Canaiolo bianco ARSIAL-CRA 402" is the only official clone of Canaiolo bianco that is actually Drupeggio.
Wine regions.
Drupeggio is almost exclusively found in its home land of Italy where it is planted across the central part of the region from the Molise and Marche of eastern Italy to the Lazio, Umbria and Tuscan regions in the west. Due to its confusion with other grape varieties, particularly Vernaccia di San Gimignano in Tuscany, it is difficult to get an exact number of plantings with the 2000 census reporting and likely including some of the "other" Canaiolo biancos in the total.
The vast majority of "true" Drupeggio plantings are found in the Umbria region where it can be an important blending variety in the wines of Orvieto. Here Drupeggio, along with Grechetto and Malvasia Toscana, can make up to 20-30% of the blend along with Trebbiano (50-65%) and Verdello (15-25%). Outside of Umbria, it is found in the provinces of Firenze, Grosseto and Pistoia where it is permitted to be blended with Malvasia and Trebbiano in several Tuscan DOCs. In the Carmignano region, up to 10% of Drupeggio is permitted to be used in the red and rosé wines of the "declassified" DOC of Barco Reale where it may be blended with Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Canaiolo nero, Trebbiano and Cabernet Franc.
Synonyms.
Over the years, Drupeggio has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Bottaio bianco (in Tuscany), Cacinello, Cacciumo (in the province of Campobasso in Molise, Canaiolo bianco, Canajola, Canina (in the province of Ascoli Piceno in the Marche), Drupeccio (in Orvieto), Lupeccio, Trupeccio (in Orvieto), Uva dei Cani (in Ascoli Piceno) and Volpicchio (in Tuscany).

Prison film

A prison film is a film genre concerned with prison life and often prison escape. These films range from acclaimed dramas examining the nature of prisons, such as "Cool Hand Luke", "Brubaker", "Escape from Alcatraz", "The Shawshank Redemption", "Kiss of the Spider Woman", and "Murder One" to actioners like "Lock Up", "Undisputed", and "Forced to Fight", and even comedies satirizing the genre like "Stir Crazy", "Life", and "Let's Go To Prison".
Themes repeatedly visited in the action films include escape attempts, gang activities inside the prison, and an entire subgenre of films where the toughest prisoners are permitted (or forced) to engage in boxing matches or martial arts bouts, replete with high-stakes wagering on the outcomes. These elements may be meshed together, where for example a prisoner forced to fight uses the occasion to plan an escape.
POW films.
Prison films set during war have become a popular subgenre known as prisoner of war film.

Raymond Langston

Dr. Raymond "Ray" Langston, M.D. is a fictional character on the CBS crime drama "", portrayed by Laurence Fishburne. He joined the show in the ninth season, after the departure of Gil Grissom, played by William Petersen. His last name is taken from Fishburne's son, Langston.
Between the middle of season 9 and the end of season 11, he appeared in every episode, with the exception of "418/427" from . He appeared in 59 out of 60 episodes.
In June 2011, it was announced that Fishburne did not renew his contract with the show, making the finale his final appearance.
Background.
Raymond was an Army brat born in Seoul, South Korea, and consequently calls the sport of soccer by its more widely recognized name, "football". His father, a decorated soldier and a veteran of the Korean War, was a violent man, often involved in brawls off the battlefield; as a result, Langston's childhood was a painful one. Raymond eventually obtained a medical degree and became a pathologist at a hospital. A co-worker at his hospital was an Angel of Death, murdering 27 patients. While Langston saw the evidence, he was never able to put it together. He ultimately wrote a book about the experiences, titled "In Front of my Eyes", which was read by not only Gil Grissom but also Archie Johnson and Dr. Tom Loman (of ""). 
Afterward, Langston became a professor at West Las Vegas University, but continued to do "pro bono" work as a surgeon. It was in this capacity that he came into contact with the CSI team, as they were investigating a series of murders attributed to serial killer Nate Haskell, who Langston interviewed for the course. After the case's conclusion, Grissom encouraged Langston to join the Las Vegas Crime Lab as a Level 1 investigator.
Career as a CSI.
In the season 9 episode "The Grave Shift", Langston began his first day on the job. His first day was troubling for him, as he overdusted a print and ruined it, dropped a burned body and tore its shift, got his necktie stuck in the victim's blood (causing it to become evidence), and drew Riley Adams's criticism when he reprimanded a man who struck his son. He also received a cold welcome from David Hodges, who was still unhappy about Gil Grissom's departure, but who warms up to Langston after the latter demonstrates a cornmeal bomb. Nevertheless, the team accepts him as one of their own, inviting him to join them at a dinner. 
In later episodes, it is revealed that Langston has a number of interests, including blues music and quickly befriended the like-minded Doc Al Robbins. In "Deep Fried and Minty Fresh", it is revealed Langston knows some Mandarin Chinese. He is the only member of the team who rides a motorcycle to work.
Langston, despite his calm demeanor, occasionally takes cases personally. In his first case, he reprimanded a father for shouting at his son while the team was searching the boy's room, earning a reprimand from Riley about keeping an emotional distance. In "Mascara", one of his former students who was planning on joining CSI is killed, and Langston attacks the suspects when he blames it on a god. He was forced to kill a suspect in self-defense in the Season 9 finale, "All In"; his lack of guilt over the event worries him. It was the first time he had taken a life in the line of duty. In episode "No Way Out" he and fellow CSI Riley Adams are held hostage in the aftermath of a shootout in a quiet Las Vegas neighborhood in which Riley was successfully able to disarm the suspect. 
By the tenth season premiere episode, Langston has taken numerous courses (going so far as to max out the hours the lab will pay for and paying out of his own pocket) and has since been promoted to CSI Level 2, as well as to being cleared of suspicion from the events of "All In". As seen in "Sin City Blue", he said no to giving his DNA to the crime lab to clear him from the investigation; the reason why is later speculated on by Wendy Simms and David Hodges in "Doctor Who," though the two draw no concrete conclusions. In the episode "All That Cremains", it is revealed that he was once married to a woman named Gloria; yet it is known from the "" episode "Hammer Down," he had no children with her. She arrives at the crime lab to visit Ray, tell him she is getting married, and invites him to the wedding. She asks Ray to come to dinner where he will meet her future husband. He said that he would think about it, but he does arrive at dinner to meet them. At the end of the episode, he gets dressed up and Nick Stokes notices that he is still wearing his wedding ring. Nick suggests that Ray not to wear it at the wedding. After Nick leaves, Ray takes his ring off, puts it in his locker and leaves for the wedding.
Trouble with Nate Haskell.
Serial killer Nate Haskell first appears in the Season 9 episode "19 Down", the first part of the final episode of Gil Grissom, the former supervisor of the crime lab. Langston was a professor of forensics and taught a class in college. Grissom comes to one of his classes, which is when Haskell is mentioned. After Langston became a CSI following Grissom's retirement, Haskell emerges again when he calls Langston in the first part of the Season 10 finale "Doctor Who." 
At the conclusion of Season 10 ("Meat Jekyll"), Langston is stabbed by Haskell in the closing minutes of the second part of the finale and collapses to the ground, bleeding. 
In the eleventh season premiere, Ray survives the attack but has lost one of his kidneys as a result and regularly needs a cane to help him although in later episodes, he seems to be fully capable of walking without it.
Later in the episode "Bump and Grind," Langston receives a letter from Haskell, where he finds a kidney bean and note that says, "Just thinking about you, XO, Nate". In the end of the episode, he looks at the scars that Haskell gave him and Sara Sidle walks in. He tells her about the letter that Haskell sent him, and Sara tells him to not let Haskell get in his way. 
Later in the episode "Targets of Obsession", Langston goes to court to testify against Haskell. During the trial, Haskell contends that he is a victim of his own circumstances. As a child, he was abused by his alcoholic father, and he is also a carrier of the MAO-A gene, which has been shown to predispose an individual to violent behavior. When Langston takes the stand, Haskell forces him to recount in full detail the attack at the crime lab. At first, it appears that the jury has been swayed by Haskell's testimony; however, near the close of the case, Langston returns to the stand to rebuke Haskell's MAO-A defense. When Haskell questions Langston's ability to testify on the matter, Langston reveals that he is personally equipped to discuss the influence of the MAO-A gene on a person's behavior. Like Haskell, Langston reveals, he too was abused by an alcoholic father and has the MAO-A gene. The fact that Langston has avoided becoming a criminal himself and instead takes pleasure in seeing criminals being brought to justice proves for the court that neither abuse nor the MAO-A gene can determine a person's behavior, and Haskell is found guilty.
Haskell sends a signal to his fiancée, which Langston notices while the verdict was being read. As Langston was leaving to go home after his success in court, he sees the group of women that tried to free Haskell through his defenses and becomes suspicious when he doesn't see Haskell's fiancée nor a certain other woman. He remembers the signal sent and quickly returns to the prison where Haskell was being held, and finds that there was another inmate wearing Nate Haskell's prison band. It is later shown that Haskell's fiancée helped him escape by killing the other inmates, the other prison guards, and the woman that helped her.
In the episode "Unleashed," Ray reveals to Lady Heather, that when he was applying for medical school, he was asked why he wanted to be a doctor. He responded with as long as he was helping people, he was not hurting them. Lady Heather remarks that his ugly side will be the one to catch Haskell. Ray replies that his ugly side won't catch Haskell, but instead kill him.
In the episode "Father of the Bride," Ray and the team receive a video of Haskell. It showed his fiancée, Vivian, who helped him escape, and it appeared to be a ransom video. In the Season 11 finale, Langston snaps after Haskell hints that he (Haskell) sexually assaulted Gloria. Langston beats him multiple times, using his medical knowledge to inflict as much damage as possible to Haskell. He damages Haskell's kidney in retaliation, and breaks his knee. After a series of beatings, Ray throws Haskell over a railing killing him. Catherine sent in the report to Internal Affairs saying the evidence supports that he acted in self-defense. At the end of the episode, Internal Affairs interviews him, and asks if he killed Haskell in self-defense or murdered him. The episode abruptly ends. 
In the Season 12 premiere, "73 Seconds", Brass and Doc Robbins mention that Ray is back in Baltimore with Gloria, and Doc Robbins tells Brass that killing Haskell was probably the best thing for Ray, as it saved his life. 
Though Ray was not formally charged by IA, he was pressured into leaving the team, and in addition, almost all of the CSIs involved were affected in some way; Nick Stokes and Catherine Willows were both stripped of their positions of graveyard shift supervisor and assistant supervisor, respectively, because of the team's attempt to shield Ray and for not bringing Ray into line during his attempt to find Haskell.
Relationships with colleagues.
When Langston first joined, he was warmly received by the team and has a good working relationship with them. When it comes to analyzing evidence and the science, he sometimes acts as a mentor to the likes of Nick (who first gives him the title "Doctor Ray") and Greg, telling them the little-known or weird facts. Hodges, who initially seemed to dislike him, eventually warmed up to his new colleague. He notably developed a friendship with Doc Robbins and the two are often seen in the morgue exchanging banter over the corpse they are examining.
Relationships with other series.
Laurence Fishburne made guest appearances as Dr. Raymond Langston in ' and ' in the tenth season of "CSI", appearing in episodes aired the week of November 9, 2009. This gives him the distinction of being one of only three actors from the main cast of one "CSI" program to appear in the same role on all three, the other two being David Caruso as Lt. Horatio Caine and Gary Sinise as Detective Mac Taylor.

Erbaluce

Erbaluce or Erbaluce Bianca is a white Italian wine grape grown primarily in the Piedmont region around Caluso, in Canavese. In addition to dry table wines, it is used to make sweet wines "passito" with deep golden coloring. The grape has a long history in the Piedmont region, with the first written record dating to 1606, and most likely originated in the alpine hills of northern Piedmont.
In the 21st century, DNA profiling determined that Erbaluce has a close genetic relationship with another Piedmontese wine grape, Cascarolo bianco, though the exact nature of that relationship is not yet known.
Wines.
Wines made from Erbaluce tend to be dry with noticeable acidity. While the grape's acidity makes it ideally suitable for sweet wine production, the dry wines need to have considerable amount of fruit in order to balance that acidity. Both the dry and sweet styles of Erbaluce tend to exhibit characteristic apple aromas and flavors. Since the 1990s, Piedmontese producers have been working on improving the quality of Erbaluce wines to compete with the whites of Cortese and Arneis.
Erbaluce di Caluso is a DOCG wine.
Synonyms.
Erbaluce is also known under the following synonyms: Alba Lucenti, Albaluce, Albe Lucenti, Ambra, Bianc Rousti, Bianchera, Bianco Rusti, Erba Luce, Erbaluce Bianca, Erbalucente, Erbalucente Bianca, Erbalus, Erbcalon, Greco Novarese, Repcalon, Trebbiano Gentile, Trebbiano Perugino, Trebbiano Verde dell'Umbria, Uva Rustia, Uva Rustica, and Vernazza di Gattinara.

Dunchurch railway station was a railway station serving Dunchurch in the English county of Warwickshire on the Rugby to Leamington line.
Among the many schemes to build a line between Rugby and Leamington was one by the Rugby, Leamington and Warwick Railway Company. This later became known as the Rugby and Leamington Railway and received Royal assent on 13 August 1846. The undertaking was sold to the London and North Western Railway on 17 November 1846 and the line opened on 1 March 1851.
When the line opened there only two intermediate stations (at Birdingbury and Marton) despite Dunchurch's population of 6,061 at the time. Dunchurch had to wait more than 20 years before the LNWR opened the station at the point where the railway crossed beneath the road to Coventry (now the A45 trunk road) 1¾ miles west of the village.
Dunchurch station received the same service as the other intermediate stations. Bradshaw's July 1922 timetable shows 10 trains a day to Rugby and 9 trains to Leamington Spa. The service was unchanged in the timetable of July 1938.
The station closed to passengers on 15 June 1959 and closed to freight on 2 November 1964.

Favorita (grape)

Favorita is a white Italian wine grape grown primarily in the Piedmont region. It is most widely planted on the left bank of the Tanaro river in the Roero district near Alba, though some plantings exist on the right bank of the Tanaro in the Langhe hills. Recent DNA profiling shows that Favorita is related to the Liguria grapes Pigato and Vermentino, which may support the theory that the grape originated there. Since the late 20th century, plantings of Favorita have been on the decline as Chardonnay and Arneis have increased in popularity among producers on the right and left bank of the Tanaro respectively. Featuring larger berry sizes than most wine grapes, Favorita has been a popular table grape in Piedmont.
History.
Favorita has long been closely associated with the Ligurian grape Vermentino, with some early ampelographers theorizing that the two grapes were one and the same. In 1964, the Italian Ministry of Agriculture determined that there were enough differences in the buds, clusters and leaves of the two vines to officially classify them as separate grape varieties. In recent years, DNA profiling has shown Favorita to be related to Vermentino, as well as Pigato, but confirmed it as a distinct variety.
Wines.
Favorita wines are noted for their intense pear notes and an ability to age longer than Arneis. The grapes tend to ripen late and maintain a fair amount of acidity. Historically it has been used as a blending partner with Nebbiolo to soften that grape's harsh tannins. When planted on warm climate sites, the Favorita can develop minerality and notes of sea salt. Exposure to oak barrel aging can give the wine a rounder mouthfeel.

Fernão Pires

Fernão Pires is a white Portuguese wine grape grown throughout Portugal but most notable in the Tejo (just north-east of Lisbon) and Bairrada (about 50miles south of Porto) where it is also known as "Maria Gomes". This variety is known to produce wines with a spicy aromatic character, though often with delicate exotic fruity notes. Generally not expected to be a long-living wine, this wine is best drunk in its infancy or matured for up to 2 or 3 years. Outside of Portugal there are some significant plantings in South Africa.
Fernão Pires is also known under the synonyms Camarate, Fernam Pires, Fernan Piriz, Fernão Pirão, Fernao Pires, Fernão Pires do Beco, Gaeiro, Gaieiro, Maria Gomes, and Molinha.

The Eclectic Review

The Eclectic Review was a British periodical published monthly during the first half of the 19th century aimed at highly literate readers of all classes. Published between 1805 and 1868, it reviewed books in many fields, including literature, history, theology, politics, science, art, and philosophy. The "Eclectic" paid special attention to literature, reviewing major new Romantic writers such as William Wordsworth and Lord Byron as well as emerging Victorian novelists such as Charles Dickens. Unlike their fellow publications, however, they also paid attention to American literature, seriously reviewing the works of writers such as Washington Irving.
Although the "Eclectic" was founded by Dissenters, it adhered to a strict code of non-denominationalism; however, its religious background may have contributed to its serious intellectual tone. Initially modeled on 18th-century periodicals, the "Eclectic" adapted early to the competitive periodical market of the early 19th century, changing its style to include longer, more evaluative reviews. It remained a generally successful periodical for most of its run.
The editing history of the "Eclectic" can be divided into four periods: the first is dominated by co-founder Daniel Parken, who helped establish the popularity of the periodical; after Parken's death, Josiah Conder, after purchasing the periodical, edited it from 1813 until 1836, during years of financial hardship; from 1837 to 1855, Thomas Price edited the periodical, returning it to its popularity and success; in its final years, several people served as managing editor and the "Eclectic" had some of its best years. Although few of the contributors of the "Eclectic" remain famous today, such as the poet James Montgomery, many of them were well-known academics or reformers of the time, such as the abolitionist George Thompson and the theological scholar Adam Clarke.
Founding and competition.
Modeled on 18th-century periodicals such as the "Monthly Review" and "The Critical Review", issues of the "Eclectic Review" typically included several long reviews in addition to many short notices. Its long reviews included both "review articles", which reviewed several books on the same subject, and "review essays", which used a single book as a way to begin discussing a larger subject of interest. However, unlike its 18th-century models, the "Eclectic" was able to successfully compete in the early 19th-century market, with the "Edinburgh Review", the "Quarterly Review", and the "Westminster Review". As James Basker explains in his short history of the "Eclectic", the "Edinburgh Review" was its "most illustrious and its most antagonistic rival", and like it, the "Eclectic" "offered sophisticated criticism that moved almost completely away from the old-fashioned techniques of quotation and abstract toward a genuine critical evaluation of books and their significance in the broader contexts both of the author's canon and of their formal or intellectual tradition". Basker writes that "the "Eclectic" grew to become what is now a massive and invaluable archive of the literary and intellectual history of the nineteenth century".
The "Eclectic" was founded on but not dominated by nonconformist principles. Unlike most periodicals at the time, it was a non-profit publication. From its foundation, all profits were donated to the British and Foreign Bible Society. The religious affiliation of the periodical, while non-denominational, may have affected its content. Basker speculates that its religious foundations are connected to its "high proportion of serious intellectual discussion and rather less than usual treatment of lighter literary from such as drama and the novel".
Editors and contributors.
The publishing history of the "Eclectic" can be divided into four periods. During its first year, the periodical was edited by Samuel Greatheed, a Dissenting minister; however, it was co-founder and fellow Dissenter Daniel Parken who built up the readership and contributor list of the periodical while he served as editor from 1806 to 1812. He was also responsible for what Basker calls "the policy of enlightened, non-demoninational (if not ecumenical) editorial policies" at the "Eclectic". After Parken's death in 1812, Theophilus Williams took over editorship of the periodical. It almost collapsed until it was purchased by Josiah Conder in 1813, with whom the second major period began. Conder continued editing the periodical until 1836, financing it himself and often writing entire issues. From 1837 until 1855—the third period—Thomas Price edited the periodical (with the exception of one three-month period when William Linwood tried to take over the editorship). According to Basker, "Price reinvigorated the "Eclectic"", specifically by rigorously adhering to a neutral position on religion, by expanding the topics covered to include foreign publications, and by lowering the price from two shillings to eighteen pence. His aim was to appeal to families. As his health declined, Price co-edited with William Hendry Stowell from 1851 to 1855 and during 1855 with his successor, Jonathan Edwards Ryland. The last period of the "Eclectic"'s history, described by Basker as its "most unstable", began with Price's departure. An anonymous editor took over from Ryland and changed the "Eclectic" into a miscellany. Edwin Paxton Hood took over as editor in January 1861, changing the periodical back to a book review, increasing the size of each issue, and lowering the price still further. According to Basker, these last years were successful and the periodical produced "some of its finest review journalism".
About 60 of the contributors to the "Eclectic" have been identified. Basker writes that "few...were particularly famous, even in their own day". Only two or three are still notable today: James Mill, the father of philosopher John Stuart Mill; the poet and friend of Lord Byron, James Montgomery; and man of letters, Edwin Paxton Hood. However, as Basker points out "although the rest may be forgotten today, it is nonetheless true to say (as one of its editors said in the 1830s) that 'the pages of the ["Eclectic"] have been enriched by the contributions of many of the most powerful intellects of the age'". Among these were the mathematician, scientist, and theologian Olinthus Gilbert Gregory, the theological scholar Adam Clarke, the abolitionist George Thompson, the reformer Andrew Reed, and the theologian, scientist, and philanthropist Thomas Chalmers.
Audience.
Basker writes that the "Eclectic" was "clearly aimed at the highly literate and thoughtful reader" but it was "anything but elitist about the audience it sought". The founders deliberately set a low price so that many classes of people could purchase the journal. Its reviews of family encyclopedias, such Dionysius Lardner's "Cabinet Cyclopedia" suggest that it was aimed at the lower-middle and lower classes.
William Copeland Astbury wrote in his diary, March 12 1831, "To the park. Forenoon. Diurnal Economy. To the park... Afternoon. Revised Eclectic Review 'March'"
Content.
The "Eclectic" reviewed more American literature than any other English periodical of the time. By 1806, it had an entire section dedicated to American literature. As Basker explains, "this continuing attention to American literature was far more than a condescending curiosity about the culture of the young republic. Rather remarkably, even as early as 1810, American authors were accorded the same serious treatment as the major authors in English and other European languages." For example, in 1820 the "Eclectic" began reviewing Washington Irving's "Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon", writing that it was "the first purely literary production that has issued from the American press, which could claim to rank, in point of original talent and classic elegance of style, with the best English authors".
However, English authors were still given far more attention than American, and William Wordsworth was the most reviewed of all. Essays were written about the new Romantic movement. In general, the "Eclectic" preferred Wordsworth to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, particularly after the publication of "Kubla Khan", calling on him "to break off his desultory and luxurious habits, and to brace his mind to intellectual exertion". Percy Bysshe Shelley was criticized for his profanity and atheism, however John Keats was judged to have "promise". After Wordsworth, it was Byron's poetry which was reviewed most often. The "Eclectic" criticized it, but heralded works such as "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage", writing that the reader would "be dazzled even to tears". The major novelists of the time were not neglected. For example, Sir Walter Scott's novels were reviewed, due to their popularity, "but his works were regarded with a certain ambivalence". In reviewing "Ivanhoe", for example, the reviewer wrote that it was "one of the cleverest of all our Author's productions" but that it was "a failure" as a romance. Almost all of Charles Dickens's novels were reviewed in the "Eclectic", as were novels by the Brontës, William Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, Victor Hugo, and George Eliot. According to Basker, "the "Eclectic"'s treatment of the novel was balanced, insightful, and sophisticated". The "Eclectic" also reviewed the works of important literary figures such as George Crabbe, Robert Burns, James Hogg, William Hazlitt, Stendhal, and Goethe. It did not shy away from reviewing the works of controversial figures, however, such as Thomas de Quincey. It reviewed the works of both Brownings, calling Elizabeth Barrett Browning "the Schiller of our higher nature" and compared Robert Browning to Tennyson. The "Eclectic" also claimed to be the first journal to "discover" and "to notice at any length" Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market and Other Poems".
As Basker writes, "beyond literature, the "Eclectic" covered books in every field imaginable". For example, the January 1845 issue had seven major articles; three were on literary subjects and the rest were on theology, politics, education, and natural history. The "Eclectic" also reviewed art exhibitions. Furthermore, important contemporary scientific and philosophical subjects were given extensive space. For example, the Oxford Movement was debated and Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" was reviewed. Basker writes that "in general, over the years the "Eclectic" showed remarkable tolerance for other religious groups—not only the various denominations of Protestants, but also Roman Catholics and Jews." Moreover, it steadfastly opposed slavery and supported social reform.
Reception.
The "Eclectic", as its most successful, "enjoyed a wide readership in England, America, and presumably throughout the British Empire", according to Basker. The journal was reprinted in the United States by Foster, Bisbee, and Col. in New York.

Penallta Colliery

Penallta Colliery was a coal mine, located close to Hengoed in the Rhymney Valley in the South Wales Valleys. A coal mine which in 1935 held the European record for coal wound in a 24-hour period, it is now the site of an original redevelopment project which will make use of the former pit head buildings.
History.
Situated near Hengoed, in 1905 Powell Duffryn began the sinking of Penallta colliery, and had employed 291 men by 1908. The two shafts Nos.1 (downcast ) and 2 (upcast ), and at the time were the deepest in the South Wales Coalfield. The first coal was raised in 1909, with the railway served by the Cylla branch which connected it to both the Rhymney Railway from the Ystrad Mynach north junction, and the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway. By 1923 there were 2,395 men employed, producing from the Six Feet seam, and at peak production during the 1930s, there were in excess of 3,200 men employed. In 1930 it produced 975,603 tons, and in 1935 it held the European record for coal winding.
Nationalisation.
In 1947, the mine was nationalised as part of the governments post-World War II regeneration scheme, and became owned by the National Coal Board. Investment was made, and in the late 1940s a Meco-Moore Cutter Loader was installed, one of the first power loaders to be used in British mines, and as a result the Minister of Fuel and Power Hugh Gaitskell made a visit in December 1949. The colliery formed a rugby union club in 1952 called Penallta RFC, and in 1954 produced 500,000 tonnes of coal. During 1960 the shafts were extended to reach 800 yards as part of a scheme, which also included electrification of the shaft winding engines. 
But access to coal was becoming more difficult, and by the 1970s only 700 men were producing 210,000 tons yearly from the Lower Nine Feet and Seven Feet seams - both 20% of the figures at the height of production. The colliery survived the 1984-1985 miners strike, and made impressive gains in production after the return to work. But it was closed by British Coal on 1 November 1991 with the last shift led out by a brass band, the last deep mine working in the Rhymney Valley.
Redevelopment.
In 1996, a vision for Penallta was put forward by Caerphilly County Borough Council, in partnership with Groundwork Wales and various local community, statutory and voluntary agencies. Stage1 of the project converted 180 hectares of derelict land transformed into a community park. Stage2 created more access, through the installation of a bridle path and cycle tracks, and a stone footpath.
To complete redevelopment of Penallta, the council developed a business park on the site, and have now agreed a development project which will result in a housing estate on part of the site, whereby the listed building status of the headgear of the two shafts are proposed to be part of a pioneering housing development scheme.

Al Abbas Mosque

The Al-‘Abbās Mosque or Masjid al-‘Abbās () is the mausoleum of ‘Abbās ibn ‘Alī, located across from the Imām Husayn Mosque in Karbalā, Iraq. ‘Abbās was the brother of Hasan and Husayn, and was the flag-bearer for Husayn in the Battle of Karbalā. The distance between the shrines of ‘Abbās and Husayn, are the same as the distance between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah.
Environmental effects over the years have caused the Euphrates river to change direction. Nearly 1400 years after the Battle of Karbalā, the river flows across the grave of ‘Abbās and encircles it. It is said that the Euphrates has come to ‘Abbās now.
History and design.
Emperors and kings of various dynasties have offered valuable gifts and gems to the shrine of ‘Abbās. In 1622 Abbas Shah Safavi ordered the decoration of the grave's dome. He built a window around the grave and organized the precinct.
The majority of the modern design was done by Persian and Central Asian architects. The central pear shaped dome is an ornately decorated structure with two tall minarets on its sides. The tomb is covered with pure gold and surrounded by a trellis of silver, along with Iranian carpets rolled out on the floors. During 2008 construction work continued with the aims of creating partially gilded minarets.

Citadel of Montpellier

The Citadel of Montpellier is an Early Modern fortification in the city of Montpellier, in the Hérault département of southern France. It was built between 1624 and 1627, after several rebellions under the orders of Louis XIII in order to keep watch over the town. In the 20th century it became the Joffre Barracks, named after Joseph Joffre, and since 1958 the citadel has been an academic campus, the Lycée Joffre.
History.
Military history.
In 1621, King Louis XIII arrived with soldiers to quell a Huguenot rebellion; he took over the city after an eight-month siege. The king ordered that a royal citadel close to the city be constructed to control the city and the surrounding region, where there was a large Huguenot population.
The citadel was built between 1624 and 1627 between the fortifications of the "Écusson", or old town, and the coastal plain of the River Lez. It was separated from the city proper by a wide esplanade, looking over the floodplain of the Lez. It comprised four bastions organized in a square: facing the city was the "Bastion du Roi" ("King's Bastion") to the northwest and the "Bastion de la Reine" ("Queen's Bastion") to the southwest; facing the floodplain was the "Bastion de Montmorency" to the northeast and the "Bastion de Ventadour" to the southeast.
The buildings within the citadel have been reconstructed multiple times. The last reconstruction before the citadel was converted into an educational building was in 1863. 
Under the Ancien Régime, the citadel held royal troops as well as detachments of conscripted forces from Bas-Languedoc. Later, it became a barracks of the 2nd regiment of Génie.
Scholarly history.
During the 19th century, it became clear that the high school for young men in Montpellier was too small: having been built near the esplanade in 1804 in the same place as a former Jesuit school, by the later part of the century the high school and its students were dispersed throughout two other sites north of the old town.
In 1947 city authorities decided to move the high school into the citadel, which had since become the Joffre Barracks. The first classes were held there on 1 October 1948, and the last students were moved in during October 1959.
Since then, the buildings have been reconstructed and new buildings for classrooms have been added. The powder magazine of the "Bastion de Montmorency" has been converted into a pool and gymnasium, and the nearby fields into athletic fields. The academic campus, constituted of the middle school, high school and "classes préparatoires", occupies 15 hectares.
Remains still intact.
Of the original citadel, the following vestiges remain:

Heston Carter

Dr. Heston Carter is a fictional character in the soap opera "Doctors", played by Owen Brenman. He made his first appearance on 14 October 2008.
Storylines.
Background.
Heston originally trained to be an Orthopaedic Surgeon and worked in the NHS for years. He wasn't that popular with staff, especially Vivien March, the former matron on his Orthopaedic ward. Heston decided to work as a GP following a heart attack which made him re-assess his future.
2008—.
Heston is first mentioned when Julia Parsons and George Woodson are discussing who she is interviewing for Joe Fenton's job. Heston's interview did not get off to a good start, as he assumed Julia to be a receptionist. Heston managed to get the job by taking Julia to the Icon Bar for lunch where he convinced her that he was right for the job. Julia has since had second thoughts due to Heston's unconventional approach to patient care and the ruffled feathers amongst the other staff. However, it seems Heston is to be a permanent fixture as he has been offered a partnership. Heston has taken on the role of mentoring new GP Registrar, Simon Bond. From the very beginning of Lily Hassan's arrival at The Mill, it is clear Heston is in love with her. Despite her constant rejection, he perseveres and it is made clear at the start of 2009 that she has feelings for him also. After helping Lionel and Vivien reunite, Lily kisses Heston. Since then they have been in a relationship. At the Mill's Christmas Party in 2009, Lily proposed to Heston but he rejected it. In early 2009 after working very hard as a doctor and a partner Heston suffered a minor heart attack. Lily helped and supported Heston through this he later recovered at returned to his usual self.
Heston recently made a shocking revelation during an assertiveness class he attended with Ruth. After going too far in a role play, Ruth says it’s a blessing he never had children to which Heston said that he was a father - once. At the beginning of October 2009, Heston's wife, Christine O'Connell played by Christine Kavanagh, and mother of his recently announced child, Steven O'Connell played by Theo Cowan, re-appeared in his life and he was determined to make sure that she didn't make his life a misery once again. On 5 January, Heston's friend Charlie Bradfield arrives after Jimmi gets kidnapped and Charlie does Jimmi's work for him. He supported Charlie when he causes them both to get kicked out of an Indian restaurant where Charlie is accused of molesting the restaurant manager's wife. During the later part of 2011 to the beginning of 2012 Heston began dating Marina Bonnaire. At first he could see her charming side, but later into the relationship he saw another side to her. She would become erratic and violent towards him, even at the slightest thing like if he missed a meal and was late home. One day Heston decided enough was enough after dealing with a patients case he felt particularly passionate about, he asked Marina to leave. She packed her bags and headed off to her son Ian's house in the hope he'd take her in. The next day Heston lied to his The Mill colleagues about the situation regarding Marina's departure, saying it was in fact she who initiated the split.
Heston has been a victim of a burglary, finding his home trashed and robbed. His colleagues help him to tidy up, but Heston can not fathom or cope with what has happened. He begins to replace his possessions- with the help of Dr. Kevin Tyler- but subsequently discovers his insurance was invalid, and they will not pay out for his losses. He begins to sleep with a cricket bat beside his bed, in fear that the robber will return. When his robber returns one night, Heston confronts him in his kitchen- but is threatened with a screwdriver by the robber- Curtis- who begins to leave with Heston's belongings. Heston flies into a rage and follows Curtis to the driveway and hits him with the cricket bat 3 times, rendering Curtis unconscious and bleeding from a head wound. A neighbour witnesses this after hearing the commotion, and calls the Police. Heston is arrested and taken to Letherbridge police station, where he lies in his preliminary interview with PC Cook (the arresting officer) and behaves in a pompous and arrogant manner- stating he is the victim and has the right to protect his home. When he is informed that only reasonable force can be used, Heston states that he only hit Curtis once and PC Cook does not believe him. Rob Hollins is shocked to find Heston in the cells, and also what he hears Heston has said- Heston had refused legal advice, which Rob tells him is a bad decision. Heston admits to Rob that he has lied about the number of times he hit Curtis.
In his second interview, PC Cook informs Heston that medical evidence suggests that Curtis has been hit more than once and that he is in surgery with bad injuries. Heston admits he may have hit Curtis more than once, and asks for a lawyer one PC Cook informs him that he will be charged with attempted murder. The Crown Prosecution Service later charges Heston, much to his shock and dismay. He had been sure that he would not be charged, and seems reluctant to accept the severity of his part in the event. All of Heston's colleagues are shocked to learn of what happened, Cherry and Mrs. Tembe are devastated. But when Mrs. Tembe participates in some voluntary hospital work, she encounters Curtis and pleads with him to drop the charges. Curtis, however, complains about her action to the police- and Rob informs Mrs. Tembe that she cannot interfere with the case and it may damage Heston's chances in court. She is horrified. Further still, when a video of the attack appears on the internet showing Heston hitting Curtis- seemingly unarmed- his colleagues worry about what Heston will be facing at court.

Camille Abily

Camille Anne Françoise Abily (born 5 December 1984 in Rennes) is a French football player who currently plays for French club Lyon of the Division 1 Féminine. She plays primarily as an attacking midfielder. Abily is a two-time winner of the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Female Player of the Year and, following her second consecutive honour in 2007, became the first women to win the award in back-to-back seasons. Following a move to the Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) league in the United States, she earned Player of the Month and All-Star honors.
Abily began her football career joining Jeanne d'Arc Bruz in 1992. In 1994, she joined nearby club FC Bruz. After a year's stint at another local club, Abily spent time in the first division playing for Stade Briochin and La Roche-sur-Yon. In 2002, she was selected to attend the women's section of the nationally recognized Clairefontaine academy. After her stint at Clairefontaine, Abily signed with Montpellier and won two league titles while at the club, as well as the Challenge de France, the women's domestic cup. After three seasons with Montpellier, Abily joined Lyon. Similar to her stint at Montpellier, she won several titles, which included three straight league titles from 2006–2009. In 2008, Abily joined the new United States-based women's soccer league, Women's Professional Soccer, after her American playing rights were chosen by the Los Angeles Sol in the 2008 WPS International Draft. After helping the Sol win the league, Abily returned to France where she played for Paris Saint-Germain on loan. In 2010, she returned to the United States to play with FC Gold Pride and, subsequently, won her second consecutive title in the league. In 2010, Abily announced that she would be returning to Lyon for the 2010–11 season and, subsequently, was a part of the team that won the 2010–11 UEFA Women's Champions League.
Abily is also a French international. Prior to playing for the senior team, she played at youth level representing the under-18 team at the 2001 UEFA Women's Under-18 Championship. Abily made her senior international debut in September 2001 in a friendly match against the Netherlands. She scored her first goal for the national team six years later in a 2–0 win over China in February 2007. Abily made her major international tournament debut for the team at UEFA Women's Euro 2005 and later played on the teams that qualified for UEFA Women's Euro 2009 and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.
Club career.
Abily has won the league with her respective club on four occasions. She won two titles with Montpellier and back-to-back titles with Lyon. During two of those title runs, she was selected as the Female Player of the Year in 2006 and 2007. In 2010 she won the WPS Championship with the FC Gold Pride.
In March 2009, she joined the new United States-based women's soccer league, Women's Professional Soccer, after her American playing rights were assigned to the Los Angeles Sol. She made her debut in the league's inaugural match against the Washington Freedom, which included her French compatriot Sonia Bompastor, and scored the second goal in the Sol's 2–0 victory. On 7 January 2010 Abily was traded to FC Gold Pride. She played in 17 games, scoring one goal and having six assists. On 27 September, Abily's contract with the Gold Pride was mutually terminated as she decided to return to Olympique Lyonnais and focus on the upcoming 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Daytona Beach Golf Course

The Daytona Beach Golf Course is a municipal golf course, located at 600 Wilder Blvd. in Daytona Beach, Florida. The facility is owned and operated by the City of Daytona Beach, and offers two courses, the North Course and the South Course.
Overview.
In addition to the two parkland golf courses, the facility offers a lighted driving range, practice putting green, pro shop, and full service restaurant. The complex is managed by John Cameron as General Manager, with Brian Jaquet as the onsite Golf Professional and Forrest Ensminger as Superintendent. Special programs are offered for Juniors, Ladies, and Seniors.
History.
The Daytona Beach Golf Club was constructed in 1921. The South course remains true to the original layout, as designed by Donald Ross, one of the most significant golf course designers in the history of the sport. The course features live oaks, tall pines, and water hazards.
The North course was designed and built in 1966 by Amos "Slim" Deatherage, who was the club's head professional and manager at the time. In 1997 the course was redesigned by Lloyd Clifton, with all greens, bunkers, and tees being redone. The resulting course winds through dense live oak and pine, with more water hazards and more undulations on the greens.

<doc id="19791579" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19791579" title="Saint Ludmila (oratorio)">
Saint Ludmila (oratorio)

Antonín Dvořák composed his oratorio Saint Ludmila (Czech: Svatá Ludmila () for soloists, choir and orchestra, between September 1885 and May 1886. The oratorio (Op. 71, B. 144) was written to a text by the Czech writer and translator Jaroslav Vrchlický. "Saint Ludmila" is Dvořák's third oratorio, and is considered one of his foremost works.
Background.
The work was commissioned by the publisher Littleton during Dvořák's first visit to England. It was intended for the Leeds Festival, and Dvořák, well acquainted with the English festival tradition, was attracted by the idea. He was also impressed by the high standard of English orchestras and choirs, and particularly by their performances of oratorios. On the other hand, he was also inspired by his own religiousness; he composed many works to Christian religious texts, as well as "Hussite Overture", a "protestant" instrumental work. 
Chronologically "Saint Ludmila" follows the "Symphony No.7 in D Minor" (finished in March, 1885), and both works are influenced by the actual historical events of that time. The year 1884 was restless for the Czechs; they organized demonstrations and patriotic manifestations of solidarity in the fight for freedom, the Austrian police had forbidden the singing of Czech songs, and the social situation was very tense. Dvořák turned to typical Czech and Slavonic themes during this time in order to support the national movement, although he was approached by his German publisher Simrock to depart from patriotic themes and instead create works based on world famous literary works. Dvořák, however, refused in one of his letters to Simrock saying, ""... an artist also has a country for which he must have firm faith and a fervent heart."" The work is thus of a national rather than religious character, which is apparent mainly in the choral scenes.
The first performance was not well received; the work was criticised for its length, its Czech theme and also for its alleged musical dependence on Händel, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Wagner, Haydn and Beethoven. Dvořák later rewrote and reduced several parts of the composition. "Saint Ludmila" was premiered in Prague in 1901, and the first performance with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra took place on 3 April 1904. However, Dvořák was seriously ill and didn't attended this performance. 
Saint Ludmila has a long performance tradition on Czech concert stages. It was given at the third Prague Spring International Music Festival in 1948, conducted by Rafael Kubelík. It was Kubelík's last public performance in his native country for many years.
In November 1954 the Czech Philharmonic with Karel Šejna performed the work at two concerts in the Smetana Hall of the Municipal House in Prague. In 1987 another concert took place, this time with the conductor Václav Neumann. The first performance in the 21st century was given in 2004, one hundred years after Dvořák's death, with the Czech Philharmonic and conductor Jiří Bělohlávek.
Structure.
The verses of the libretto are based on historical fact. Prince Rastislav of Great Moravia asked the brothers Cyril and Methodius of Thessalonica to spread Christianity in his country. In 863 they came bringing the Glagolitic alphabet which laid the foundation of Slavonic literature. During this time, Great Moravia came under the influence of the Byzantine Empire. Later, this cultural and political influence spread also to Bohemia and in 874, Bořivoj I, Duke of Bohemia and his wife Saint Ludmila were baptised. 
The story is set at the beginning of this era. The hermit Ivan accepts the task of missionary, his eloquence winning over Ludmila, the Bohemian princess. She meets Prince Bořivoj and they are then married. Bořivoj is baptised under the influence of the new teaching and becomes Christian.
The libretto consists of three parts. The situation in the first part is tense as Ivan comes into conflict with the pagans. Ludmila intervenes. In the second part Dvořák applied his talent for melody and ability to express feelings of love. The finale is festive and pompous with a statement of the ancient Czech chorale ""Hospodine, pomiluj ny"" (Mighty Lord, have mercy upon us) which dates from about the eleventh century. The composition has been appreciated for its melodiousness and colourful instrumentation.

Louisa Nécib

Louisa Nécib (born 23 January 1987) is a French women's international footballer who plays for French club Olympique Lyonnais of the Division 1 Féminine. She plays as a central attacking midfielder and is described as a "gifted playmaker" who "possesses superb technique". Nécib is also known for her "elegant possession, sublime passing skills, and cultured touch on the ball". She has been labeled by the French media as "the female Zidane", primarily due to having an Algerian background, growing up in Marseille like Zidane, and having immense skill.
Nécib began her football career playing for local youth clubs in her hometown of Marseille, such as Union Sportive Marseille and Celtic de Marseille. With the latter club, she made her senior team debut in 2003 and, in the following season, helped the club win the Division 3 Féminine. In 2004, Nécib was selected to attend CNFE Clairefontaine, the women's section of the Clairefontaine academy. She spent two years at the training center, and in 2006, departed for Montpellier of the Division 1 Féminine. In her only season with Montpellier, Nécib helped the team win the 2006–07 edition of the Challenge de France. After departing Montpellier, she joined Lyon. Since joining the club, Nécib has won a slew of trophies, which include four league titles, one Challenge de France, and one UEFA Women's Champions League title. For her performances during the 2008–09 season, she was named the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Female Player of the Year.
Nécib is a former French women's youth international having represented her nation at all levels for which she was eligible. At under-19 level, she played on the teams that reached the 2004 and 2005 editions of the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship. With the under-20 team, Nécib played at the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship scoring a goal in the group stage against Argentina as France reached the quarter-finals. Prior to playing in the U-20 Women's World Cup, Nécib made her senior international debut in February 2005 in a friendly match against Norway. Two years later in March 2007, Nécib scored her first senior international goal in a UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying victory over Greece. She has participated in three major international tournaments for her country; the 2005 and 2009 editions of UEFA Women's Euro and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. In the latter competition, Nécib acted as the playmaker and contributed to the team that finished in fourth place.
Personal life.
Nécib was born on 23 January 1987 in the city of Marseille to parents of Algerian origin. Her father emigrated to France from Biskra, while her mother moved to France from Oran. Nécib was raised in Busserine, a quarter located in the northern suburbs of the 14th arrondissement of Marseille and has a brother and sister. After signing with Lyon, Nécib enrolled at the Université Lyon 1 with hopes of completing her undergraduate studies in "Sciences et techniques des activités physiques et sportives" (STAP) (). She developed an interest in football at a young age, prior to which she trained in gymnastics. She, initially, did not look at the future prospects of women's football and played mainly for recreation with males stating "I'd always played with the boys in my neighborhood" and "I didn't plan to join a club because, to be honest, I didn't know girls' teams existed. Then, one day I found out there was a club in the 14th arrondissement and I signed up".
Club career.
Early career.
Nécib began her career as a youth player for her hometown club Union Sportive de Marseille. After spending two years at the club, she signed on with nearby Celtic de Marseille. Nécib spent six months developing in the academy and, in April 2002, she was selected to attend the under-16 female National Cup representing her region. The competition served as a training camp for the Centre National de Formation et d'Entraînement (CNFE) () located at the Clairefontaine academy in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines. The initiative to allow women to train at the famous national center came about in the 1990s due to the fact that it had quickly become a high-level training facility for male football players. As a result of allowing female football players to train at the academy, younger women were afforded the same benefits from the facilities offered by Clairefontaine as the men. At the National Cup, Nécib impressed and was given an award by coaches for possessing the best shot of any player. After the competition, she returned to Celtic.
At the age of 16, Nécib was promoted to the senior team by coach Yohan Silvy in the latter part of the 2002–03 season. While at the club, Nécib was teammates with future national teammate Caroline Pizzala. In the 2003–04 season, Nécib flourished and helped the club reach the Division 3 Féminine league final where they faced the women's team of professional men's club Le Mans. In the tie, Nécib started and played the full match as Celtic cruised to a 4–1 victory. The result promoted the club to the Division 2 Féminine, the second division of French women's football. Nécib's performance that season attracted numerous attention, which resulted in her being nicknamed "Titou" as homage to Zinedine Zidane, who is nicknamed "Zizou".
After three years with Celtic, in July 2004, Nécib was selected to attend the CNFE academy at Clairefontaine. She initially struggled to adapt at the center admitting "the first year was really hard because I was so far from my family. I almost gave up". However, after developing a rapport with future international teammates Sarah Bouhaddi, Élodie Thomis, Laure Boulleau, Jessica Houara, and the aforementioned Pizzala, Nécib quickly returned to the form that got her selected to the center. The CNFE academy is allowed participation in the French women's football league system and, from 2002–2007, fielded a team that participated in the Division 1 Féminine. Nécib spent two seasons with the team and made her league debut on 29 August 2004 against Lyon. In the match, she scored the only goal, a 90th minute winner, in a 1–0 win. Nécib finished the campaign with 20 league appearances and six goals. Four of her six goals came in the final four weeks of the season. On 26 March 2005, she scored a double in a 4–2 defeat to Juvisy. A week later, she scored the only goal in a win over Olympique Saint-Memmie and, on the final match day of the season, she scored the team's fourth goal in a 5–1 win over Lyon. CNFE ultimately finished the campaign in 5th place position. In the following season, Nécib appeared in 18 matches and scored three goals, all of which came in victories.
Montpellier.
After completing her education and training at Clairefontaine, Nécib returned to the south of France to sign with Division 1 Féminine club Montpellier. She joined the club alongside former Clairefontaine teammate Thomis and made her debut on 3 September 2006 in a 0–0 league draw with Toulouse. She scored her first goal for the club two weeks later on 17 September converting a double in a 5–0 away win over USCO Compiègne. On 8 October, Nécib scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory against Soyaux. In November, she scored two goals each in wins over FCF Condé-sur-Noireau and Hénin-Beaumont. Nécib finished the campaign with 11 league goals, which was third-best on the team behind Thomis and Elodie Ramos. In the Challenge de France, the women's domestic cup competition in France, Nécib helped Montpellier reach the final where the team faced Lyon. She played the entire match as Montpellier won 3–0 on penalties. The domestic cup title was Nécib's first major honour of her career.
Lyon.
Following the season, on 22 June 2007, Lyon officials announced that the club had signed both Nécib and Thomis to contracts. Nécib was handed the number 14 shirt and made her club debut on 2 September 2007 in the team's opening league match of the campaign; a 4–0 win over La Roche-sur-Yon. A week later, she scored her first goal for Lyon converting a penalty kick in a 2–0 win against Paris Saint-Germain. Nécib also made her debut in European competition participating in the 2007–08 edition of the UEFA Women's Cup. On her debut against the women's team of Slovak outfit Slovan Duslo Šaľa in the group stage, Nécib netted a hat trick in a 12–0 win. She ultimately finished the European campaign appearing in ten matches and scoring six goals as Lyon reached the semi-finals where the club was eliminated by Swedish club Umeå. While simultaneously performing well in Europe, Nécib remained productive in the league scoring in league wins over Toulouse, Hénin-Beaumont, and Soyaux late in the season. Lyon eventually pulled away from both Juvisy and Montpellier in the league standings to claim its second straight league title and Nécib's first overall. Nécib later helped Lyon capture its third Challenge de France, which completed the club's league and cup double that season. She scored the second goal in a 3–0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final match.
During the infancy of the 2008–09 season, Nécib was selected to join the new United States-based women's soccer league, Women's Professional Soccer, after her American playing rights were assigned to the Washington Freedom in the 2008 WPS International Draft. Her Lyon teammate Sonia Bompastor was also assigned to the Freedom. While Bompastor was allowed to negotiate her exit out of the club, Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas was able to convince Nécib to remain in France after having previously declared the player off limits. Nécib scored her first league goal of the campaign on 14 September 2008 in a 12–0 home win over Vendenheim. A month later, she scored a double in a 8–1 victory over Soyaux. Nécib repeated her two-goal display on 1 February 2009 in a 5–0 away win over Stade Briochin. In the UEFA Women's Cup, Nécib scored her first two goals of the campaign in a 8–0 home win over Austrian club Neulengbach in a second qualifying round group stage match. On 18 November, she scored the third goal in a 4–1 second leg win over Italian club Bardolino. The 9–1 aggregate scoreline advanced Lyon to the semi-finals for the second consecutive season where Lyon were again eliminated, this time by German team FCR 2001 Duisburg. In the league, Lyon captured its third straight league title, but was unable to defend its Challenge de France title losing to the eventual champions Montpellier in the semi-finals. For her performances during the campaign, Nécib was named the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Female Player of the Year.
In the 2009–10 season, Nécib switched to the number 10 shirt and, due to participating in UEFA Women's Euro 2009, was limited to two substitute appearances in the team's first three matches of the season. In her first start of the campaign against Soyaux, she scored a double in a 5–0 win. In the team's first match following the September international break, Nécib scored a goal in the team's 7–1 away win over Toulouse. In November, while on international duty with France, Nécib suffered an injury and, subsequently, missed five weeks domestically. She returned to the team in the new year in a league match against Saint-Étienne. In the match, she scored a goal in a 4–0 win. Nécib finished the campaign scoring two goals in the team's final four league matches as Lyon claimed its fourth consecutive league championship and reached the semi-finals of the Challenge de France. In the re-branded UEFA Women's Champions League, Nécib made eight appearances scoring four goals as Lyon reached the final. In the semi-finals against Umeå, she converted two goals in a 3–2 first leg victory. The 0–0 draw in the second leg allowed Lyon to advance to the final. In the penultimate match, Lyon faced German club Turbine Potsdam. Nécib played the entire match in regulation time, but was substituted out prior to the start of extra time. Lyon eventually conceded defeat losing 7–6 on penalties.
For the second time in her career at Lyon, in the 2010–11 season, Nécib converted double-digit goals scoring 14, which was third-best on the team behind Sandrine Brétigny and Eugénie Le Sommer. She opened the campaign by scoring in the team's first league match; a 6–0 win over Toulouse. Two weeks later, Nécib scored the second goal in a 3–0 victory against Stade Briochin. After scoring against La Roche-sur-Yon on 7 November 2010, she went scoreless for two months. On 9 January 2011, she scored two goals in a 7–0 home win over Hénin-Beaumont. Two weeks later, Nécib scored another set of goals, this time against Juvisy in a 7–1 win. In the Challenge de France, she scored in back-to-back rounds against Montigny-le-Bretonneux and Rodez before playing 53 minutes in a quarter-final defeat on penalties to Juvisy. On the final match day of the season, despite Lyon clinching its fifth straight league title with several matches to spare, Nécib started the match and scored her first league hat trick in a 8–0 victory. In the 2010–11 edition of the Women's Champions League, she scored her only goal of the competition on 4 November 2010 in the first leg of Lyon's Round of 16 tie against Russian club Rossiyanka. Nécib netted the final goal in a 6–1 away win. Despite her limited scoring, Lyon still reached the final where the team faced its nemesis Turbine Potsdam. In the final, Nécib started the match and played 55 minutes before being substituted out. Lyon went on to win the match 2–0 to claim its first-ever European title.
After the 2011–12 season, Nécib's contract with Lyon expired, which led to speculation that the player would join league rivals Paris Saint-Germain. However, on 16 July 2012, Nécib re-signed with Lyon after agreeing to a four-year contract with an option for a fifth year.
International career.
Youth.
Nécib is former France women's youth international having played for her nation at every level for which she was eligible. On 11 September 2003, she was called up to international level for the first time by coach Gérard Sergent to play with the under-17 team. She played with the team at the 2003 edition of the Nordic Cup, a premier women's youth tournament, before earning a call up to the under-19 team by coach Bruno Bini. At under-19 level, Nécib featured heavily playing with the team at the La Manga Cup and also representing France at the 2004 and 2005 editions of the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship. In the 2004 competition, she appeared in two group stage matches as France suffered elimination in the group stage. In the 2005 edition, Nécib started all five matches France played as the team reached the final. She scored her only goal in the competition in a 4–0 opening group stage victory against Russia. In the final, France faced their group stage opponents Russia and were defeated 6–5 on penalties after the match finished 2–2 in regulation time.
Due to France's second-place finish at the 2005 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, the team qualified for the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship, which merited under-20 appearances for Nécib. She made her under-20 debut on 12 August 2006 in a World Cup preparation friendly against Mexico. In the match, Nécib scored the team's second goal in a 4–2 victory. At the World Cup, Nécib appeared in all four matches France contested. In the team's opening group stage match against Argentina, she scored the team's third goal in a 5–0 win. France suffered elimination in the quarter-finals losing 2–1 to North Korea.
Senior.
Prior to playing at the 2005 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, Nécib made her senior international debut on 19 February 2005 in a friendly match against Norway. She started the match and was substituted out after 56 minutes as France won 2–0. The victory was France's first-ever against Norway. Despite featuring in only two senior international matches, the other match being the return leg friendly against Norway on 22 February, Nécib, at the age of 18, was included in the team to play at UEFA Women's Euro 2005 by coach Elisabeth Loisel. The midfielder featured in only one match in the competition; the final group stage match against Germany. Nécib played the entire match as the Germans won 3–0. In 2010, Nécib admitted that she took the Germany defeat hard stating "I still have regrets because all we needed was a draw and we conceded three goals in ten minutes". France had kept the Germans at bay for the majority of the match before letting in three goals in the final 20 minutes.
Following the conclusion of the 2006 U-20 World Cup, Nécib began playing full-time with the senior team participating in qualification matches for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. During the season, Nécib also played with the team at the 2006 edition of the Algarve Cup. On 22 April 2006, she played with the team in a 5–0 World Cup qualification win against Hungary. Afterwards, Nécib failed to appear with the team in its final three qualification matches as France missed the World Cup after drawing 1–1 with England in its final qualifying match. France needed an outright victory to qualify for the tournament.
After the firing of Loisel and the appointment of former youth national team coach Bruno Bini in 2007, Nécib became a regular starter in the team and, on 11 April 2007, scored her first international goal in a 6–0 victory over Greece in qualification for UEFA Women's Euro 2009. She featured as a starter in all seven qualification matches she appeared in and
scored another qualification goal in a 8–0 away win over Serbia on 27 October 2007 as France qualified for the competition with one match to spare. In the lead up to UEFA Women's Euro 2009, France participated in the 2009 Cyprus Cup. In the competition, Nécib appeared in three matches and scored the team's second goal in a 3–2 group stage win over South Africa. France later finished the competition in third place. Nécib did not participate in the third place victory over New Zealand. After being selected by Bini to participate in Women's Euro 2009, Nécib scored her fourth international goal in a preparation friendly against Scotland on 12 August 2009. In her second major competition for France, Nécib started all four of the team's matches. She scored her first major international goal in the team's opening group stage match against Iceland netting the final goal in a 3–1 win. France reached the quarter-finals before suffering elimination losing on penalties to the Netherlands.
Following Women's Euro 2009, Nécib returned to the national team duty to participate in qualification for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. In qualification, she participated in nine of the ten qualifying round group stage matches France contested. France finished the stage winning all of its matches and conceding no goals. Nécib scored two goals during the round against Estionia in a 12–0 win and Northern Ireland in a 6–0 victory. In September 2010, she played in both legs of France's World Cup playoff match against Italy. France won the tie 3–2 on aggregate to qualify for its second FIFA Women's World Cup. On 19 November 2010, Nécib scored her first international double in a 5–0 friendly win over Poland. After playing in the 2011 Cyprus Cup and several friendly matches, on 6 June 2011, Nécib was named to the 21-woman squad to participate in the World Cup. On 18 June, in a prep friendly against Belgium, she scored her tenth international goal in a 7–0 home win.
On 26 June 2011, in France's opening World Cup group stage match against Nigeria, Nécib, on her competition's debut, was named the "Player of the Match" for her performance in the team's 1–0 victory. In the team's second group stage match against Canada, she assisted on the final goal, scored by Thomis, in a 4–0 win. Nécib started France's final four matches in the competition, which included a 4–2 loss against Germany in the team final group stage match and a 4–3 penalty shootout victory over England in the quarter-finals. France were eliminated from the competition in the semi-finals losing 3–1 to the United States. On 16 July, in the third place match against Sweden, Nécib was forced to leave the match after 30 minutes due to an injury, a sprained knee who forced her to leave the stadium on crutches. France lost 2–1. During and after the competition, Nécib was praised for her performance by several media outlets with one publication declaring that she "was largely responsible for France making it the semifinals in the first place".
Style of play.
Nécib primarily plays as a central attacking midfielder, but can also occupy the roles of a deep-lying midfielder and a winger. Domestically, she primarily plays in the playmaker role, while at international level, she plays as a winger in Bruno Bini's 4–3–3 formation. Two of Nécib's most common exemplary traits is her vision and passing, which has been described as "one-of-a-kind" and "sublime", respectively. She is also known for her distinct understanding of the game, which has led to her developing "a great football IQ". Her understanding has allowed her to determine "when to take a defender on one-on-one, how to find a teammate with a slide-rule pass, and how to exploit tight spaces to create scoring chances for herself and her cohorts". Since making her debut with Celtic de Marseille, Nécib's playing style, ability, and cultural background have drawn comparisons to French legend Zinedine Zidane. The midfielder admits its an honour to be compared to Zidane, but has regularly attempted to disassociate herself from the player stating "Being compared to Zidane is really nice, but I don’t think it can harm me because I’ve been hearing it since I was very young. It always makes me proud, but as I always say, I don’t think you can compare anyone to him. He’s unique". While training at the Clairefontaine academy in 2004, Nécib met Zidane, who was at the training center in preparation for 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. The two players exchanged shirts and the shirt Nécib acquired from Zidane is currently in the possession of her father.

McGill Street (Montreal)

McGill Street (officially rue McGill) is a street in Montreal named after James McGill after whom McGill University is named. The former head office building of Canadian National Railway Company, built for its predecessor Grand Trunk Railway, still stands on McGill Street and is now occupied by Quebec government offices.
In 1871, an advertisement for the Albion Hotel in an Ottawa newspaper called McGill Street "the great thoroughfare and commercial centre of the city". The McCord Museum of Canadian History refers to the street as "an important artery in Montreal."
The Quartier International de Montréal (Montreal's international district) describes McGill Street as "the link between the strategic sectors of the Old Port, Old Montreal, the Cité Multimedia and the Quartier international." 
The Montreal station of the Montreal and Southern Counties Railway interurban streetcar line was located on McGill Street. The station building is still standing, although no longer used for transportation purposes.
McGill Street runs from Victoria Square south to rue de la Commune in the Old Port, at the head of the Lachine Canal. North of Victoria Square, the street transitions to Beaver Hall Hill.

Compostmodern

Compostmodern is a biennial interdisciplinary design conference dedicated to promoting sustainable design solutions for designers and business leaders. Compostmodern is presented by the San Francisco chapter of AIGA — the professional association for design. 
Compostmodern presents sustainable design as an everyday practice and way of thinking rather than a niche interest. The event explores the potential for ecologically sustainable growth and responsible design, focusing on practical applications of design thinking. Presentations by designers, clients and manufacturers offer resources, tools, and strategies for promoting sustainability in participants’ projects and work environments.
WorldChanging’s Jeremy Faludi called the 2006 conference “inspiring and engaging people while remaining realistic.” He noted “one of the coolest things about the conference was a small one: for the lunch and water-bottles that were provided, all the packaging plastic was made from PLA, and the “silverware” was made from potato starch plastic. Many conferences forget details like this, but they’re important. We can’t just talk green, we have to be green, too.”
History.
Compostmodern was conceived in 2003 by Phil Hamlett (AIGA SF Environment Chair, and AIGA National Board of Directors member), Jennifer Pattee and Amos Klausner (AIGA SF chapter director) and co-presented by the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA). In January 2004 the inaugural event was held at the California College of the Arts (CCA) San Francisco Campus and drew over 400 attendees. In January 2006, the event moved to the Academy of Art University’s Morgan Auditorium and drew over 500 attendees. With the establishment—and subsequent involvement—of the AIGA Center for Sustainable Design (CFSD), production of the event broadened. Gaby Brink (AIGA SF Environment Chair) and Donald W. Savoie (AIGA SF executive director) oversaw production of the 2008 event which drew 600 attendees from all over the country. The addition of Joel Makower as emcee and speaker podcasts on the website further extended the conference’s reach and appeal. The 2009 conference was moved to a larger venue, the Herbst Theatre, and attracted over 600 attendees. The 2011 conference will return to the Herbst Theatre but will be expanded into a two-day conference, January 22-23, 2011.

Élodie Thomis

Élodie Ginette Thomis (born 13 August 1986 in Colombes) is a French football player who currently plays for French club Olympique Lyonnais of the Division 1 Féminine. She plays either a winger or striker and is described as a player who possesses pace comparable to that of French men's internationals Thierry Henry and Sidney Govou. Thomis is a former graduate of the women's section of the Clairefontaine academy and is currently a French women's international having made her debut with the team in June 2005 at UEFA Women's Euro 2005 against Italy.
Career.
Early career.
Thomis was born in the commune of Colombes, a northwestern suburb of Paris, to parents of Martiniquais heritage. She, initially, began her career in athletics training as a sprinter and long-distance runner. At the age of 13, Thomis began playing football after attending a trial for women footballers in Épinay-sur-Seine. After successfully starring for the local club, she joined "Football Club Feminin de Colombes" in her hometown. In 2002, Thomis was selected to attend CNFE Clairefontaine, the women's section of the Clairefontaine academy. She spent three years training at the facility alongside future domestic teammates Louisa Necib, as well as future international teammates Caroline Pizzala, Élise Bussaglia, and Laure Lepailleur. In three seasons at the academy, Thomis played in over 50 matches scoring 32 goals.
Montpellier and Lyon.
After departing Clairefontaine, Thomis joined Division 1 Féminine club Montpellier. Necib later joined the club the following year. In her first season with the club, Thomis appeared in 20 league matches scoring three goals as Montpellier finished runner-up in the league to Juvisy. She also made her European debut participating in the 2005–06 UEFA Women's Cup. In the team's first leg quarter-final tie against Norwegian outfit Brøndby IF, Thomis scored a double, which, after a positive result in the second leg, allowed Montpellier to advanced to the semi-finals where the club was eliminated by the eventual champions 1. FFC Frankfurt. Thomis' goal output increased in the 2005–06 season scoring 15 goals in 22 matches as Montpellier claimed the Challenge de France, the women's domestic cup in France. After the season, in June 2007, rival D1 Féminine Lyon confirmed that both Thomis and Necib would be joining the club for the 2007–08 season. In her debut season at Lyon, she played in 17 league matches scoring seven goals helping the club win the league and cup double. In the 2008–09 season, Thomis appeared in 17 total matches scoring 14 goals as Lyon won the league for the third consecutive season and reached the semi-finals for the second straight season in the UEFA Women's Cup.
In the ensuing two seasons, due to injuries, Thomis was limited to only 30 appearances domestically. The striker did scored 17 goals in that span. In the re-branded UEFA Women's Champions League, Thomis made eight appearances scoring three goals as Lyon reached the final in the 2009–10 edition of the competition. Lyon was defeated by German club Turbine Potsdam in the penultimate match.

Pseudohallucination

A pseudohallucination is an involuntary sensory experience vivid enough to be regarded as a hallucination, but recognised by the patient not to be the result of external stimuli. Unlike normal hallucination, which occurs when one sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels something that is not there, with a compelling feeling or thought that it is real, pseudohallucinations are recognised by the person as unreal.
In other words, it is a hallucination that is recognized as a hallucination, as opposed to a "normal" hallucination which would be perceived as real. An example used in psychiatry is the hearing of voices which are "inside the head" according to the patient; in contrast, a hallucination would be indistinguishable to the patient from a real external stimulus, e.g. "people were talking about me".
The term is not widely used in the psychiatric and medical fields, as it is considered ambiguous; the term "nonpsychotic hallucination" is preferred. Pseudohallucinations, then, are more likely to happen with a hallucinogenic drug.
A further distinction is sometimes made between pseudohallucinations and "parahallucinations", the latter being a result of damage to the peripheral nervous system.
They are considered a feature of conversion disorder, somatization disorder, and dissociative disorders. Also, pseudohallucinations can occur in people with visual/hearing loss, with the typical such type being Charles Bonnet syndrome.

Metcalfe Street (Montreal)

Metcalfe Street (officially rue Metcalfe) is a north-south street located in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It links Sherbrooke Street in the north and René Lévesque Boulevard in the south. It is best known for being the street on which the Sun Life Building (1155 Metcalfe Street), Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral (formerly known as Saint James Cathedral), and other notable buildings are located. South of René Lévesque Boulevard, the street is known as Cathedral Street (French: "rue de la Cathédrale"). The street borders the eastern side of both Dorchester Square and Place du Canada, to the south. 
History.
Opened in the mid 19th century, the street owes its name to Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe (1785–1846), the 16th Governor General of Canada.

Robert Joseph Hermann

Robert J. Hermann (born August 12, 1934) is an American Roman Catholic Bishop: Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, Titular bishop of Zerta. Hermann was appointed by Pope John Paul II on October 16, 2002, as the Auxiliary Bishop to serve the Archdiocese of Saint Louis. Hermann was ordained bishop on December 12, 2002, by the previous archbishop of Saint Louis, Justin Rigali. Cardinal Rigali's successor, the immediate past Archbishop of Saint Louis Raymond Leo Burke, who is currently Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura and Cardinal, left the Archdiocese on June 27, 2008. The Archdiocesan Consultors elected Bishop Hermann Archdiocesan Administrator until April 21, 2009, when Bishop Robert James Carlson of Saginaw, Michigan, was named Archbishop and led the archdiocese as apostolic administrator in concert with Archbishop-elect Carlson until the Archbishop's installation on June 10, 2009. He continued to serve as Auxiliary Bishop until his retirement on December 1, 2010.
Simple Biography.
Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus Hermann represented the Archbishop in overseeing the parishes in five deaneries: Northeast St. Louis County, Northwest St. Louis County, Festus, St. Charles County and Washington. His responsibilities also included Catholic education, stewardship and development, and several other agencies and ministries.
For more than four decades, Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus Hermann has connected with parishioners as a Pastor. That cherished connection continues today. As an Auxiliary Bishop, he shares in the Archbishop’s responsibility of teaching, sanctifying and governing the faithful of the Archdiocese. As an auxiliary bishop, even in retirement, he has the power to ordain candidates for the presbyterate and for the Diaconate, and to serve as a co-consecrator of a bishop.
A Word From Bishop Hermann.
“There’s nothing I love more than evangelization, especially through homilies during weekday and Sunday Masses. In preparing for the homilies, I reflect on how the Scriptures are calling me to change my life. Only after that reflection can I speak from my heart to others.”—Bishop Robert J. Hermann
Bishop Hermann's Famous Position on Abortion.
Bishop Robert Hermann on Voting as though 'Judgment Day is on its Way'
By Bishop Robert Hermann
10/18/2008
St. Louis Review
The Catholic Church teaches that the issue of life is the most basic issue and must be given priority over the issue of the economy.
ST. LOUIS, Mo (Catholic Online) - The Most Rev. Bishop Robert J. Hermann currently serves as the administrator of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, a Diocese vacated when Archbishop Raymond Burke was named to his Vatican position to preside over the global judicial system of the Catholic Church. On June 27, Pope Benedict XVI appointed me to the office of Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. This column was entitled "'Judgment Day is on its Way" and was published in the St. Louis Review, the diocesan newspaper. Catholic Online presents this article in our continuing effort to assist our readers and viewers in informing their conscience for the vital task of exercising their "Faithful Citizenship":
Judgment Day is on its Way
"Judgment Day is on its way. We cannot stop it. We don’t know when it will come, but just as surely as the sun rises daily, the Son of Man will come when we least expect.
Judgment Day is on its way. For many, this coming election may very well be judgment day, for this election will measure us. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus tells us in 10:32-33: “Everyone who acknowledges Me before others, I will acknowledge before My heavenly Father. But whoever denies Me before others, I will deny before my heavenly Father.”
Judgment Day is on its way. When my time comes, I will be measured by my Savior for the decisions I have made. I will either be acknowledged by Jesus or denied by Him in the presence of our heavenly Father. The question I need to ask myself is this: What kind of witness will I give to Him when I go into the voting booth this election day?
The decision I make in the voting booth will reflect my value system. If I value the good of the economy and my current lifestyle more than I do the right to life itself, then I am in trouble. Pope John Paul II, in his post-synodal apostolic exhortation Christifideles laici tells us: “Above all, the common outcry, which is justly made on behalf of human rights — for example, the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture — is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.”
The right of our children to be protected from destruction is greater than my right to a thriving economy. I am living proof of this, since I am here because my parents believed this priority and lived it. My desire for a good economy cannot justify my voting to remove all current restrictions on abortion. My desire to end the war in Iraq cannot justify my voting to remove all current restrictions on abortion.
My parents got married about one year before the stock market crash of 1929, and yet they raised 15 children in the midst of the Great Depression. They had no money. My mother made her own wedding gown and her own bouquet of flowers. I have my parents’ wedding picture on the wall of my office, and I am reminded every day of the sacrifices they made for life.
We had no money, but we had each other! My parents were at home with us for three meals every day. We had plenty to eat because we raised almost all of our food. We seldom got new clothes, but we wore hand-me-downs, unless my mother would buy materials and make our clothes. We lived in poverty, but we learned the value of hard work. We had no running water or electricity. We had no TV, Internet or cell phone. Yet, we were very happy because we had life! We had each other! Today, all 15 children in my family of origin are most grateful for the sacrifices Mom and Dad made so that we could have life. Making sacrifices for each other brought us incredible joy and enhanced our dignity, because it gave us a chance to participate in serving each other!
In an article written by Pope John Paul I, printed in the current issue of Magnificat, the pope reflected on the life of Andrew Carnegie, who wrote: “I was born in poverty ... but I would not exchange the memories of my childhood with those of a millionaire’s children. What do they know of family joys, of the sweet figure of a mother who combines the duties of nurse, washerwoman, cook, teacher, angel and saint?” Does life get any better than this, when gifts of creativity, generosity and faith are nurtured in the midst of poverty? This is the abundant life on this earth, because it is fueled by faith and sacrifice! Perhaps this is not so much poverty as it is faith-filled luxury.
Judgment Day for us is on its way. Those 47 million children our nation destroyed are still living. We have destroyed their bodies, but their souls are still alive. When our Lord comes again, they may very well be there to judge us. Even worse, Jesus tells us that whatever we do to the least of our brethren, we do to Him. We would truly shudder if we heard the words, “I was in your my mother’s womb but you took my life!”
It is quite possible that we might see these children, but, depending upon the choices we have made, we may very well be separated from them by a great chasm which cannot be crossed, much as the rich man who ignored Lazarus, the poor man, during his lifetime here on earth but was separated from him after death. The rich man was in flames, but Lazarus was in the bosom of his heavenly Father.
The Catholic Church teaches, in its catechism, in the works of Pope John Paul II and in the writings of Pope Benedict XVI, that the issue of life is the most basic issue and must be given priority over the issue of the economy, the issue of war or any other issue. These same teachings inform us that when both candidates permit the right to abortion, but unequally so, we must chose to mitigate the evil by choosing the candidate who is less permissive of abortion.
Judgment Day is on its way! I may deny it. I may pretend that it is still far away, I may deny that my actions are sinful, but that will not change God’s judgment of me. 
The deepest problem with many of our Catholics is that they have become so accustomed to rationalizing away a life of sinful actions so that they seem to be on cruise control, heading in the wrong direction. “If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.”
My goal is not to engage you in some political party way but to engage you with our Savior and His teachings. We need to constantly challenge our accustomed behaviors in the light of the Gospel. We may say that we are following our conscience, but are we informing our consciences with the truth about these issues? Cardinal George Pell of Australia has said that we must follow truth and our conscience, but be steeped in truth so that they be rightly formed.
Perhaps having to face these issues during this coming election can turn out to be a grace that truly awakens our need to learn more about the teachings of the Catholic Church, and then to use the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that we can receive His mercy and bring our behavior into conformity with the mind and heart of Christ. It is not too late to admit our sinfulness and turn to the Lord in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. When we do this, both we and the heavens will be filled with joy!
Judgment Day is on its way. Pray your way into conformity with the teachings of Christ and His Church. Pray the family Rosary daily between now and Election Day so that you may not only make the right choice but also have the courage to discuss these issues with others who may have been misled by our materialistic culture. Include the candidates in your prayer intentions. It is my hope that our discussions will bring all of us to our knees to seek help from above.

<doc id="19792030" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19792030" title="La Dispute">
La Dispute

La Dispute is a prose comedy written by Pierre de Marivaux, shown for the first time on October 19, 1744 by the Théâtre-Italien in the Hôtel de Bourgogne. The story involves four orphans (two boys and two girls) that have been raised in isolation, from the world and from each other. An aristocrat releases four human guinea pigs into a sinister Garden of Eden to cause them to consider the question of whether man or woman is more faithful.
One of Marivaux's last pieces, "La Dispute" was received as a huge failure. It is a funny, erotic and cruel masterpiece.
Adaptations have been created from 1972 and onward in various forms.
Reception.
For the 2013 adaptation, editor for "The New York Times" Sylviane Gold wrote: "La Dispute opens with Prince and Hermiane, as a pair of exquisitely bewigged, bejeweled aristocrats, discussing with typical Marivaux finesse a lover’s question, one that would appear to have no answer. Who committed the first infidelity, mankind or womankind? But since we’re in Enlightenment France, there’s an app for that: the Prince tells his lady that when the same debate arose in his father’s court nearly 20 years earlier, a scientific experiment was devised to provide incontrovertible evidence as to who started the war between the sexes.
In a variation on one of the 18th century’s favorite themes, that of “The Wild Child,” two newborn boys, Azor and Mesrin, and two newborn girls, Églé and Adine, were removed to a distant, custom-built, high-walled enclosure. There, each was raised, and taught French, naturally, in total isolation by two faithful old servants, Mesrou and Carise. Today, the arrival of the aristocrats signals the culmination of the experiment. They will observe unseen as the now adolescent children, simply dressed in pure white, are released into one another’s company for the very first time, blank slates who will discover, or perhaps invent, love, sex and jealousy for themselves. And for the sake of science."

Jam (album)

Jam is the third studio album by British rock band Little Angels. It peaked at number one in the UK Albums Chart in 1993. It set a record for the shortest chart stay by a chart-topping album, climbing to the top and dropping off the bottom in just five weeks. The album features the band's biggest hit, "Womankind", which peaked at no. 12 during a five-week stay in the UK charts. The single "Too Much Too Young" features Canadian singer Bryan Adams on backup vocals, and also became a significant hit for the group, reaching no. 22. "Soap Box" and "Sail Away" were lesser hits, peaking at no. 33 and no. 45 respectively.
Reception.
Allmusic gave the album a positive retrospective review, saying it "had all the ingredients of a major rock album -- powerful melodic guitar-based songs [...and] softer ballads".

William Spurstowe

William Spurstowe (Spurstow) (c. 1605–1666) was an English clergyman, theologian, and member of the Westminster Assembly. He was one of the Smectymnuus group of Presbyterian clergy, supplying the final WS (read as UUS) of the acronym.
Life.
His father William Spurstow was a mercer in London. The son studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.
He became a Fellow of St. Katherine's Hall College, Cambridge in 1638, during the Mastership of Ralph Brownrigg, and succeeded as Master in 1645. At the time it was strongly Puritan in tone, with John Arrowsmith, John Bond, Thomas Goodwin, Andrew Perne and William Strong as other Fellows.
In the late 1630s he was an associate of John Hampden, and in 1638 he became vicar of Great Hampden. Later he was chaplain to Hampden's troops.
He became vicar of Hackney in 1643, and was made Master of his college. He was deprived of the mastership, in 1650.
After the Restoration, he was consulted on the "Declaration of Indulgence". He was ejected from his parish of Hackney for nonconformity, in 1662. He remained in Hackney, welcomed Richard Baxter, employed Ezekiel Hopkins, and provided a focus for numerous other ejected ministers. He built six almshouses there, work starting shortly before his death.

IPSO Alliance

The IPSO Alliance is an organization promoting the Internet Protocol (IP) for what it calls "smart object" communications. IPSO is a non-profit organization founded in 2008 with more than 50 members from technology, communications and energy companies. 
The IPSO Alliance advocates for IP networked devices in energy, consumer, healthcare and industrial applications.
Description.
Smart objects are small computers (microcontrollers) with a sensor or actuator and a communication device, embedded in objects such as thermostats, car engines, light switches, and industrial machinery. Smart objects enable a wide range of applications in areas such as home automation, building automation, factory monitoring, smart cities, structural health management systems, smart grid and energy management, and transportation.
The IPSO Alliance promotes the “Internet of Things”. The layered architecture of IP provides a high level of flexibility, innovation and accelerates the adoption of network-connected devices, often referred to as the “Internet of Things.”
IPSO offers webinars, interoperability events, and the publication of white papers. The Alliance also complements the work of entities such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the ISA, all of which develop and ratify technical standards in the industrial community.
On February 15, 2013, the IPSO Alliance announced its "IPSO Challenge 2013 competition to showcase the use of the Internet Protocol (IP) in sensor/control and M2M applications enabling the Internet of Things (IOT). 
The first round of judging closed on April 5, 2013. 
The top three finalists went to Sensors Expo in Chicago on June 6, 2013 to present their prototype or product, where the winner, Redwire Consulting of Boston for their Energy Current Harvesting device was announced. Runners up included CMD Microdevices of Colorado and ViBrain Solutions of Murcia, Spain.
August 2012 In conjunction with IETF 84 in Vancouver, BC, IPSO hosted an Internet of Things interoperability demonstration using the IPv6 and Web standards for machine-to-machine (M2M) devices and cloud services in connected home, building automation, lighting and smart energy-related applications. The Alliance also participated in the Bits-N-Bites Open House, showcasing NXP's smart light bulb, Proto6's motion sensor, and the Ericsson/Sensinode in-home sensors. 
June 2012 In celebration of World IPv6 Launch Day, the IPSO Alliance enabled its website to be IPv6 capable
March 2012 IPSO Alliance teams with European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to assemble companies to validate understanding of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) base specification under development by IETF, and tests protocol implementation interoperability and conformance. Test results provided to both the IETF and Internet of Things (IoT) communities to enhance the quality of these developing standards.
September 2011 IPSO published its first quarterly newsletter.
June, 2011 IPSO announced interoperability testing
In May 2010, ZigBee Alliance and IPv6 Forum form strategic relationships with the IPSO Alliance to speed adoption of IP networked smart objects
In April 2010, IPSO conducts a series of successful interoperability tests with several independent implementations of RPL and of 6LoWPAN-HC.
In November 2008, "TIME Magazine" listed the IPSO Alliance and the Internet of Things as the 30th most important innovation of 2008
On October 15, 2008, members of the IPSO Alliance released uIPv6, the world's smallest IPv6 stack.

Laura Georges

Laura Stéphanie Georges (born 20 August 1984 in Le Chesnay) is a French football player who plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain of the Division 1 Féminine. She serves as the first-choice captain of her club and plays primarily as a central defender, but can also be utilized as a defensive midfielder. Georges is also a France women's international having made her senior international debut in September 2001. She has represented her nation at four major international tournaments; the 2003 and 2011 editions of the FIFA Women's World Cup and the 2005 and 2009 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship.
Club career.
Early career.
Georges began her football career playing for her hometown club Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 12. She spent six years in the club's youth academy before being accepted to CNFE Clairefontaine, the women's section of the Clairefontaine academy. Georges returned to Paris Saint-Germain after a year at Clairefontaine and was promoted to the senior team for the 2003–04 season. She made 19 appearances with the team scoring one goal.
After the league season with Paris Saint-Germain, Georges announced her intentions to moved to the United States to attend Boston College. She majored in marketing and, while at the university, played college soccer for the Boston College Eagles women's soccer team. In her first season, Georges featured in 13 matches making nine starts. In her second season with the team, despite missing matches due to representing France internationally, she was named to the All-ACC first team and also earned third-team All-America honors from the NSCAA. In her final season at the university, Georges was named to the conference's first team for the second consecutive season and was awarded the ACC Defensive Player of the Year award. She was also a semifinalist for the prestigious Hermann Trophy.
Lyon.
Following the conclusion of her amateur career, Georges returned to France to join Olympique Lyonnais. In her first season with the club, she was penciled in as a starter featuring in 18 matches as Lyon finished the season as champions after going undefeated. Georges was also influential in the team's Challenge de France campaign featuring in all four matches, including the final, which Lyon won, defeating her former club Paris Saint-Germain 3–0. In the 2008–09 season, Lyon were again crowned champions. In the season, Georges scored her first career goal for Lyon in the opening league match of the season against Paris Saint-Germain. She also helped the club reach the semi-finals in both the domestic cup and UEFA Women's Cup.
Following the departure of veterans Camille Abily and Sonia Bompastor to the WPS, Georges was handed the captaincy by coach Farid Benstiti for the 2009–10. She played in 16 league matches as Lyon were declared champions for the fourth consecutive season. In Europe, Georges was a part of the Lyon team that reached the 2010 UEFA Women's Champions League Final. The team, however, lost 7–6 on penalties to German club Turbine Potsdam. In the next season, despite the return of Abily and Bompastor, Georges remained captain and displayed her leadership by leading Lyon to victory in the UEFA Women's Champions League Final.
Paris Saint-Germain.
In July 2013, she signed with PSG.
International career.
Georges made her international debut for France on 26 September 2001 in a match against the Netherlands at the age of 17.

Won Jeong-hwa

Won Jeong-hwa (born 1974) is a North Korean who was accused by South Korea of spying for the North and was sentenced to 5 years in prison in a court in Suwon on October 15, 2008. South Korean authorities arrested Won in August 2008 on the accusation of seducing South Korean military officers in exchange for classified information on military installations, which North Korea denies as being South Korean propaganda. The North denies that she even is an agent, calling her "human scum". Her step father, Kim Dong-sun, is also being prosecuted on spying charges, who was arrested at the same time as Won. According to AFP, Won was sent by the NIS to the South in 2001 in the guise of a defector and was assigned to tour the SK military to give anti-communist lectures. She used the occasion to come in to contact with military officers who she slept with for sensitive military information. Won was also found guilty of being involved in the kidnapping of a South Korean businessman from China to North Korea in 1999, and of trying to locate a top defector, Jang-yop Hwang, living in the South. Won attempted suicide in prison on December 23, 2008.

Altario, Alberta

Altario is a hamlet in east-central Alberta, Canada within Special Area No. 4. It is located on Highway 899 just north of Highway 12, approximately east of Kirriemuir and west of Compeer.
Founded in 1919, the name came from the combination of Alberta and Ontario. 
In the past Altario was a large and well populated community. It had more building in the past compared to today. Many of the old buildings included the Bideford School, a C.P.R. station, livery stables, butcher shop, McLeod Hardware, Robinson Store, Beaver Lumber, Kreiser’s Garage, Jensen’s Store, the Alberta Hotel/Bar, Jake’s Store, post office, lumber yard, hospital, the church and the Altario Hall. Most of these building are gone today, however a few are still standing. Those that still stand include the Kreiser’s Garage, Jake’s Store, the hall, the school, the Alberta Hotel/Bar, post office, and the church. Those still in use include the hall and the hotel/bar. Due to the school's original small size, it has been rebuilt and called the Altario School. The post office has also been relocated to a newer building.
With Altario being a large populated community, many things were always happening. Back in the day, Altario had many clubs/sport teams and organizations. 
Clubs/sports included were the basketball, volleyball, baseball, hockey, disking, badminton and track and field. 
Organizations include Wheatsheaf Junior U.F.A, which is an agricultural improvement association that was organized in 1927. With the surrounding hamlets of Compeer and Kirriemuir, Altario is a part of KAC. KAC stands for Kirriemuir, Altario, and Compeer. 
Altario School teaches students in grades K-12, with attendance ranging between 60 and 70 students in recent years, including some students from Compeer and Kirriemuir.
Many families in and around Altario are dependent on the cattle industry and other forms of farming.

Lionel Louis Cohen

Lionel Louis Cohen (1832 – 26 June 1887) was an English financier, politician, and communal worker. He remarried 3 times before his death. He served as a trustee and later manager of the London Stock Exchange, and became the head of his father's firm Louis Cohen & Sons. He retired in 1885 on being elected Conservative member of Parliament.
Life.
Cohen was born in London to Louis Cohen, the founder of the house of Louis Cohen & Sons, foreign bankers and members of the London Stock Exchange.
During his time in the Stock Exchange, Cohen's financial ability was shown by his services in connection with the Turkish debt, which earned for him a nomination to the order of the Medjidie. A prominent worker in the Conservative cause at a time when the great bulk of Jews were unquestioning adherents of the Liberal party, he caused considerable sensation in 1874 by appealing to Jews to exercise their independent judgment in political affairs.
At the 1885 general election he was returned to the House of Commons for the Paddington North constituency. He was re-elected in the 1886, and held the seat until his death. During his short tenure of his position he served with distinction on the royal commissions on the depression in trade, on gold and silver, and on endowed schools.
Charitable work.
Cohen from his early years devoted much time to the service of the community. On entering public life he found the three city synagogues and various societies administering charitable relief in a chaotic and unscientific manner, and took a notable part in the efforts made to remedy the evil. In 1859, when the synagogue vestries agreed, on the motion of Ephraim Alex, overseer of the poor, to delegate their powers to a specially constituted board of guardians, Cohen became its honorary secretary.
His "Scheme for the Better Management of All the Jewish Poor", elaborated in 1860, practically formed the constitution of the board of guardians for the relief of the Jewish poor, the chief charitable institution of the Anglo-Jewish community. In 1878 he was elected president of the board, and filled that office till his death. He gave in all 28 years of unremitting service to the institution, which under his inspiration earned recognition as a great and model charity within and beyond the community.
Cohen also took the leading share in the movement which, after many years of labor, culminated in the federation by Act of Parliament in 1870 of the Great, the Hambro', and the New synagogues under the title of the "United Synagogue". He presided over the first meeting of its council, of which he was elected a vice-president, and was the ruling spirit and mastermind of the organization, which during his lifetime grew into a corporation of eleven metropolitan congregations and the most influential body of its kind in the British empire.
In 1881 he initiated the movement in favor of the persecuted Russian Jews, and raised the first fund in England for their relief.
Writings.
Cohen wrote a pamphlet on Indian railways, was a frequent contributor to the Jewish journals, and wrote the masterly series of reports of the board of guardians during his tenure of office as honorary secretary of that institution. The series of statistical tables started by him in these reports has ever since formed a model for similar compilations.

National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife

National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case about federal jurisdiction over anti-pollution statutes. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion of the Court, holding that the Endangered Species Act did not require the Environmental Protection Agency to apply additional criteria when evaluating a transfer of pollution control jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer wrote dissenting opinions.
Facts.
The Clean Water Act instructs the Environmental Protection Agency to turn over authority under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System to a state if that state's proposal meets nine listed criteria. Arizona issued such a proposal. The EPA regional office replied with the concern that the transfer might violate the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits agencies from taking actions that might jeopardize endangered species. The EPA consulted the Fish and Wildlife Service, which advised that the Endangered Species Act was inapplicable because the EPA had no authority to consider additional factors beyond the nine Clean Water Act criteria. On the advice of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the EPA approved the transfer of authority to Arizona.
Procedural history.
Defenders of Wildlife, a non-profit organization concerned with endangered species, challenged the transfer, arguing that the Endangered Species Act imposed an independent requirement on the EPA's decision to approve the transfer. The EPA argued the Endangered Species Act was not an independent source of authority, but imposes requirements only on the discretionary decisions of federal agencies. Since its decision was non-discretionary under the Clean Water Act, the agency argued, the Endangered Species Act did not apply. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in favor of the Defenders of Wildlife and invalidated the transfer, finding that the Fish and Wildlife Service opinion was flawed and that the EPA's reliance on it "arbitrary and capricious" and inconsistent with previous transfers of permitting authority, in which the impact on endangered species was considered.
Decision.
Opinion of the Court.
The opinion of the Court, written by Justice Alito, held that the EPA's decision was not arbitrary and capricious, even if internally inconsistent. "The federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agency’s "final" action," Alito wrote, "and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious." The Court also agreed that because the decision was not discretionary, the Endangered Species Act did not apply.
Stevens's dissent.
Justice Stevens dissented, writing that while the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act conflicted, precedent under "Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill" and others require that the Endangered Species Act's requirements be given precedence over other aims of federal agencies.
Breyer's dissent.
Justice Breyer joined in Stevens's dissent, but differed in reserving judgment "as to whether §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ... really covers every possible agency action even of totally unrelated agencies..."

Diocletian window

Diocletian windows, also called thermal windows, are large semicircular windows characteristic of the enormous public baths ("thermae") of Ancient Rome. They have been revived on a limited basis by some classical revivalist architects in more modern times.
Description.
Diocletian windows are large segmental arched windows (or other openings) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two vertical mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.
Names.
Diocletian windows are named for the windows found in the Thermae (Baths) of Diocletian (AD 302) in Rome. (The Thermae is now the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri.) The variant name, thermal window, also comes from their association with the Thermae of Diocletian.
Influence.
This type of window was revived and used in Italy in the 16th century, especially by Andrea Palladio. Palladio and others incorporated an elongated Diocletian window in the form of an arched central light flanked by narrower, square-headed apertures. This combination became known as a Palladian, or Venetian, window.
The Diocletian window was much used in the early 18th century by the English architect Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, one of the originators of the English Palladian style, and by his followers.
Diocletian windows continued to be used occasionally in large public buildings in the various devolutions of neoclassical architecture including the Beaux Arts movement (1880–1920).

Belene labour camp

The Belene labour camp, also referred to as Belene concentration camp, was part of the network of forced labour camps in Communist Bulgaria. It was located on the Belene Island, between two branches of the Danube river. At the height of Valko Chervenkov's repressions in 1952, the camp had 2,323 inmates - 2,248 men and 75 women.
The Belene Prison is still operating as a penitentiary in the western part of the island, while the eastern part is a managed natural reserve.
This camp operated officially from 1949 to 1959, though a break in deportations to Belene occurred from 1954 to 1956. Between 1985 and 1989 Turks in Bulgaria who resisted the policy of changing Turkish names and surnames to Bulgarian ones, (see Assimilation Campaign in Bulgaria) were imprisoned in the prison on Belene. During those years, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation broadcast a series named ""Belene Adası"" ("Belene Island") on the policies of the Bulgarian government against Bulgarian Turks.
From 1949 onward, Evangelical Christian pastors in particular were targeted as "enemies of the State" and sent to Belene. In 1949, the infamous "Pastors' Trial" was conducted, trying 13 Protestant pastors as "spies". The men received sentences of varying lengths. Haralan Popov, who survived and later founded the mission "Door of Hope International" to bring Bibles behind the Iron Curtain, published his autobiography under the Bulgarian title "The Bulgarian Golgotha". It was later released in English as "Tortured for His Faith".
The camp and some its survivors were the subject of a documentary film by German TV program ZDF "Vorwärts aber nie vergessen. Ballade über bulgarische Helden" ("Moving on, but Never Forgetting. A Ballad of Bulgarian Heroes" authored by Ilija Trojanow.

Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan in 2008–09

The Sri Lankan cricket team was touring Pakistan in January and February 2009. The series was the first Test tour of Pakistan since South Africa visited in October 2007. The tour was arranged as a replacement for the scheduled tour of India which was cancelled by BCCI following 2008 Mumbai attacks.
The tour included 3 ODI's and 2 Tests.
The safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been in issue. In May 2002, New Zealand abandoned their Test series in Pakistan after a suicide bomb attack outside their hotel: they have not returned to the country since. In 2004 Lashkar-e-Taiba had issued a fatwa against playing Cricket calling it against Islam. Australia had recently refused to tour on safety grounds. In order to persuade the Sri Lankan team to visit, the Pakistan government offered to arrange "presidential-style security."
During the Second Test at Lahore, the Sri Lankan team were attacked by masked gunmen in a terror attack. Six members of the teams' security detail and two other civilians were killed. No cricketers were killed but five were listed as injured including Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan captain, and his deputy Kumar Sangakkara, Ajantha Mendis, Thilan Samaraweera and Tharanga Paranavitana.

Józef Hecht

Józef Hecht (December 14, 1891 – June 19, 1951), also known as Joseph Hecht, was a printmaker, painter and engraver. Born and educated in Poland, he made Paris his base from 1920. Trained in classical engraving techniques, Hecht was a founder of "Atelier 17", and had a profound influence on 20th-century printmakers.
Career.
Born in Łódź, Poland, in 1891, Hecht studied at the Art Academy of Kraków from 1909 to 1914. On completion of his studies in Kraków, Hecht visited museums throughout Europe. The outbreak of World War I found him in Berlin. Due to the fact that he had done his studies in the Austrian zone in Poland and thanks to prizes obtained at the Académie des Beaux-Arts, Hecht was given the option of going to neutral Norway, where he lived from 1914 to 1919.
Immediately following the armistice, Hecht traveled to Italy; and two years later to Paris, where he maintained his studio until his death. At this time Hecht became a member of the Salon d'Automne, thereby gaining an entrée into the Parisian art world and a chance to exhibit his work on a regular basis. At his Paris studio, he taught burin-engraving - the classic copper-engraving technique - to many artists, including British surrealist painter and printmaker Stanley William Hayter, South African-born British painter and printmaker Dolf Rieser.
The year 1926 was a turning point in Hecht’s career and heralded the most successful period of his life. He published his first suite of six prints, "l'Arche de Noë", which included a preface by the French symbolist Gustave Kahn and was exhibited in December that year at the Paris gallery "Le nouvel essor". Hecht’s future collaborator, mystical narrator André Suarès, wrote a laudatory catalogue article. The images that Hecht developed at this time found renewed vigor in 1928 when Suarès and Hecht collaborated on the folio, "Atlas". In "Atlas" Hecht began to re-combine images and forms he had previously studied—a working method that he refined throughout his life.
In 1927 Hecht’s encouragement of Hayter's printmaking activities led to the establishment of "Atelier 17", a cooperative printmaking studio, which endures to this day in Paris as "Atelier Contrepoint". The "Atelier" influenced artists Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Alberto Giacometti and others.
In 1929 Hecht became a founding member of the group, "La Jeune Gravure Contemporaine", which staged annual group shows and was influential in keeping the spirit of printmaking alive. Hecht also associated with members of "Les Peintres-Graveurs Indépendants", founded in 1923 by J. E. Laboureur and Raoul Dufy. It is doubtful that Hecht knew each member of these groups, but it is probable that he was familiar with their work and they with his, and that this provided an opportunity for the exchange of techniques, subjects, and ideas. Hecht was an intermediary between the avant-garde artists of Atelier 17 and more traditional printmakers.
Between 1926 and 1938 Hecht's engravings were published in various collections (see Chronology), his work was widely shown, and it gained critical acclaim. Hecht won two gold medals at the 1937 Paris World's Fair.
Later career and death.
Of Jewish descent, Hecht left Paris before the start of World War II to live in the Savoy region near the Swiss-Italian border, where he worked as an agricultural laborer.
After the war Hecht returned to Paris. Hayter, who had moved Atelier 17 to New York City for the duration of the war, returned to Paris and found his old friend in poor health and out of work. To encourage Hecht to take up engraving again, Hayter brought a large copper plate to Hecht's studio and began working on it. Hecht could not resist, and together they produced the collaborative print, ""La Noyee"". With renewed enthusiasm, Hecht began producing numerous engravings, while also developing new methods for printing in relief.
Hecht died of a heart attack in his Paris studio on 19 June 1951.

Humid subtropical climate

A humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification "Cfa" or "Cwa") is a zone of subtropical climate characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. Under the Köppen climate definition, this category of climate type covers a broad range of attributes, especially in terms of winter temperatures. Under the more modern Trewartha climate classification, most of the climates that have 8 or more months with a mean temperature of 10 C (50 F) are warm to hot much of the year with mild winters.
Description.
The Köppen definition of this climate is for the coldest month's mean temperature to be between and , and the warmest month to be above .
Some climatologists prefer to use as the lower bound for the coldest month's mean temperature. It is either accompanied with a dry winter (Köppen: w) — or has no distinguished dry season (Köppen: f).
Under the more modern Trewartha climate classification - climates are termed Humid Subtropical when they have mean temperatures of 10 C (50 F) for eight or more months a year. In most locations classed within this system, the mean temperature of the coldest month is between 4.5 C (40 F) and 7 C (45 F). Most modern climatologist consider the Trewartha grouping of subtropical climates to be more real-world and fitting on a global scale. 
Rainfall in humid subtropical climates often shows a summer peak, and where monsoons are well developed like Southeast Asia - a strong summer peak and winter drought is common. Due to the influence of the subtropical highs and subsidence, droughts can be severe and often catastrophic to agriculture. Winter rainfall is associated with large storms and fronts that the westerlies steer from west to east, that on occasion reach down into subtropical latitudes. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and weak tropical lows that move in from adjacent warm tropical oceans.
Overview of distribution.
Humid subtropical climates normally lie on the southeast side of all continents, generally between latitudes 25° and 40° north and tend to be located at coastal or near coastal locations. However, in some cases the climate extends well inland, most notably in China and the United States.
Africa.
In Africa, the humid subtropical climates are found in two separate areas on the southern hemisphere of the continent. The "Cwa" climate is found over a large portion of the interior of the Middle and Eastern African regions. This area includes; central Angola, northeastern Zimbabwe, the Niassa, Manica and Tete provinces of Mozambique, the southern Congo provinces, southwest Tanzania, and the majority of Malawi, and Zambia. Some lower portions of the Ethiopian Highlands also have this climate. The climate is also found in the narrow coastal sections of southern and eastern South Africa, primarily in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape provinces. South Africa's version of this climate features heavy oceanic influences resulting in generally milder temperatures. This is particularly evident in its winters when temperatures do not drop as low as in many other regions within the humid subtropical category.
Asia.
Locations in Asia with a humid subtropical climate differ from those in other continents in that they often have marked seasonal differences in precipitation, if not very dry winters.
East Asia.
In East Asia, this climate type is found in the southeastern quarter of mainland China, the northern half of Taiwan, northern Vietnam, narrow areas along the coast of South Korea, and Japan (Kyushu, Shikoku and most of Honshu). Cities near the equatorward boundary of this zone include Hong Kong, Hanoi and Taipei while Qingdao is near the northern boundary.
The influence of the strong Siberian anticyclone in East Asia brings colder winter temperatures southward, pushing the 0 °C isotherm as far south as the valleys of the Yellow and Wei, roughly latitude 34° N. At Hainan Island and in Taiwan, the climate transitions from subtropical into fully tropical. In most of this region, there is extremely limited precipitation during the winter, owing to the powerful anticyclonic winds from Siberia. Only in inland areas below the Yangtze River and coastal areas between approximately the Huai River and the beginning of the coast of Guangdong is there sufficient winter rainfall to produce a "Cfa" climate; even in these areas, rainfall and streamflow display a highly pronounced summer peak, unlike other regions of this climate type. The only area where winter precipitation equals or even exceeds the summer rain is on the "San-in" (Sea of Japan), or western, coast of Japan, which during winter is on the windward side of the westerlies. The winter precipitation in these regions is usually produced by low-pressure systems off the east coast that develop in the onshore flow from the Siberian high. Summer rainfall comes from the East Asian Monsoon and from frequent typhoons. Annual rainfall is generally over , and in areas below the Himalayas can be much higher still.
South Asia.
Humid subtropical climates can also be found in South Asia, primarily along the Ganges river. However, the humid subtropical climates exhibited here differ markedly from humid subtropical climates in East Asia (and for that matter a good portion of the globe). Winters here are typically mild, dry and relatively short. They also tend to be foggy. Summers tend to be long and very hot, starting from mid-April and peaking in May and early June with high temperatures often exceeding 40°C. They also tend to be extremely dry, complete with dust storms, traits usually associated with arid or semiarid climates. During this period many native trees defoliate to save water. This is followed by the cooler monsoons, where the region experiences heavy rains on almost a daily basis. Average high temperatures decreases during the monsoon season but the humidity increases. This results in hot and humid conditions, similar to summers in humid subtropical climates. Cities such as New Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur and Patna exhibit this atypical version of the climate in India. In Pakistan, the twin cities of Rawalpindi/Islamabad also feature this weather pattern, but with wetter and relatively cooler winters.
In South Asia, humid subtropical climates generally border on continental climates as altitude increases, or on winter-rainfall climates in Pakistan. Further east, in highland areas with lengthier monsoons such as Nepal, seasonal temperature variation is lower than in the lowlands.
Southwestern Asia (Northern Middle East and Caucasus).
Although humid subtropical climates in Asia are mostly confined to the southeastern quarter of the continent, there are areas on the Caspian Sea and Black Sea with humid subtropical climates that are unusually warm for their high latitudes and also unusual for this climate type, that snowfall in winter is relatively common, but is usually of a short duration.
In Southwestern Asia, the climate is prevalent in the Gilan of Iran, in parts of the Caucasus, in Azerbaijan and in Georgia wedged between the Caspian and Black seas. The climate is also present in small areas of the southern Russian Federation and coastal (Black Sea) Turkey. In the narrow Caspian coastal strip of Iran (Gilan and Mazandaran), a humid subtropical climate prevails . Annual rainfall ranges from around 740 mm (29 inches) at Sari to over 2,000 mm (78 inches) at Bandar-e Anzali, and is heavy throughout the year, with a maximum in October or November when Bandar-e Anzali can average 400 millimetres (16 inches). Temperatures are generally moderate in comparison with other parts of Southwestern Asia. In Rasht, the average maximum in July is around 28 °C (82 °F) but with near-saturation humidity, whilst in January it is around 9 °C (48 °F). The heavy, evenly distributed rainfall extends north into the Caspian coastal strip of Azerbaijan up to its northern border but this climate in Azerbaijan is, however, a "Cfb"/"Cfa" ("Oceanic climate"/"Humid subtropical climate") borderline case. During winter, the coastal areas can receive snowfall, but is usually of a short duration.
Annual rainfall in Lankaran in the southeast averages up to 1,800 mm (70 inches) and is heavy throughout the year; and annual rainfall is generally over 1,000 mm (40 inches) in the foothills of the Caucasus in the northeast, as altitude increases and the humid subtropical climate changes to the oceanic climate
Western Georgia in the Kolkheti Lowland and the north coast of Turkey, have a climate similar to that of Gilan and Mazandaran in Iran and very similar to that of southeastern and northern Azerbaijan. Temperatures range from 22 °C in summer to 5 °C in winter and rainfall is even heavier than in Caspian Iran, up to 2,300 millimetres per year in Hopa (Turkey) and up to 2,718 millimetres per year in Batumi (Georgia) falling throughout the year. This climate in northern Turkey and western Georgia is, again, a "Cfb"/"Cfa" ("Oceanic climate"/"Humid subtropical climate") borderline case. Again, during winter, the coastal areas can receive snowfall, which is usually of a short duration.
North America.
In North America, humid subtropical climates are almost exclusively the domain of the American Gulf and south Atlantic states, including the following states: the eastern half of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. On the Florida peninsula, the humid subtropical climates gives way to the tropical climate of south Florida and the Florida Keys. In the USA, the archetypal humid subtropical climate is best exemplified by a city like Savannah, Georgia - where summers are long and almost tropical, and winters are mild with temperatures reaching freezing on only a few nights. Summers in this zone are hot and humid, with daily averages above with average daily maxima above .
In Mexico, there are small areas of "Cfa" and "Cwa" climates. The climate can be found small areas scattered around the northeastern part of the country, in proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. Other areas where the climate can be found is in the high elevations of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre Oriental. Despite being located at higher elevations, these locations have summers that are too warm to qualify as a subtropical highland climate. Guadalajara’s climate is a major example of this.
Characteristics and variants.
Outside of isolated sections of Mexico, the southernmost limits of this climate in North America lie just north of South Florida and around southern coastal Texas. Cities at the southernmost limits, such as Orlando and Tampa and along the Texas coast around Brownsville generally feature warm weather year round and minimal temperature differences between seasons. These cities fall just short of having a true tropical climate. 
In contrast, cities at the northernmost limits of the humid subtropical region (using the Koppen climate classification system - as the newer Trewartha climate classification does not class any areas north of North Carolina, southern Tennessee, and southern Arkansas as subtropical), such as New York City, Philadelphia, and Louisville, Kentucky have average winter temperatures (0 C/32 F) at the coldest limit of climates classed as subtropical. These cities generally experience much colder winters than the true subtropical climates to the south. It appears likely that locations above around 35 latitude in the central and eastern USA generally fall into the humid continental climate category with more of a four-season climate. Areas along the immediate Atlantic coastline from Connecticut south to Virginia appear to have a milder or modified version of a true continental climate. 
Snowfall varies greatly in this climate zone. In locations at the southern limits of this zone and areas around the Gulf Coast, cities such as Orlando, Tampa, Houston, New Orleans, and Savannah rarely see snowfall, which occurs, at most, a few times per generation. In Southern cities farther north or inland, such as Birmingham, Atlanta, Memphis, Little Rock, Nashville, Dallas, Norfolk, Charlotte, and Raleigh, snow typically falls once or twice a season and is usually three inches or less. Ice storms are not unusual at these locations. However for the majority of the winter here, temperatures remain above or well above freezing. 
Precipitation is plentiful in the humid subtropical climate zone in North America - and tends to be concentrated in the six warmer months (May through October). Inland areas in the south tend to have precipitation spread evenly throughout the year, while there is a semblance of a monsoon pattern (dry winters/wet summers) along the Atlantic coast from southern North Carolina south to Florida. The seasonal monsoon is much stronger on the Florida peninsula, as most locations in Florida have dry winters and wet summers. In addition, areas in Texas that are slightly inland from the Gulf of Mexico, such as Austin and San Antonio that border the semi-arid climate zone, generally see a peak of precipitation in the spring, and a drought-like nadir in mid-summer.
South America.
Humid subtropical climates are found in a sizeable portion of South America. The climate extends over a few states of southern Brazil, including Paraná (state), into sections of Paraguay, all of Uruguay, and the Río de la Plata region in Argentina. Major cities such as São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Curitiba, Porto Alegre and Montevideo have a humid subtropical climate, generally in the form of hot humid summers and mild to cool winters. These areas, which include the Pampas, generally feature a "Cfa" climate categorization.
The "Cwa" climate occurs in parts of tropical highlands of São Paulo state, Minas Gerais and near the Andean highland in northwestern Argentina. These highland areas feature summer temperatures that are warm enough to fall outside the subtropical highland climate category.
Australia.
The humid subtropical climate dominates half of eastern Australia.
This zone contains the only regions where soils are not acutely deficient in phosphorus, as well as the heaviest rainfall south of the Tropic of Capricorn, making it prime agricultural country, centred on towns such as Coffs Harbour, Grafton, Kempsey, Port Macquarie, Tamworth, and Moree.
Variations in Australia.
There is variation in climate within this zone. Annual rainfall on the coast can reach as high as 2,000 mm (80 inches) in favourable locations and is generally above 1,000 mm (40 inches). However, because most of the heaviest two- and three-day rainfalls in the world occur in this coastal zone as a result of east coast lows forming to the north of a large high pressure system, there can be great variation in rainfall from year to year. At Lismore in the centre of this zone, the annual rainfall can range from less than 550 mm (22 inches) in 1915 to more than 2,780 mm (110 inches) in 1950. There is usually a distinct summer rainfall maximum that becomes more pronounced moving northwards: in Brisbane the wettest month (February) receives five times the rainfall of the driest (September). Temperatures are very warm to hot but not excessive: the average maximum in February is usually around 29 °C (84 °F) and in July around 21 °C (70 °F). Frosts are extremely rare except at higher elevations, but temperatures over 35˚C (95˚F) are not common on the coast.
North of the Cfa climate zone there is a zone centred upon Rockhampton and extending up to the Atherton Tableland of Köppen Cwa climate. This has a very pronounced dry winter with often negligible rainfall between June and October, and winter temperatures generally only slightly below 18°C, above which one would have a tropical savanna, or Aw, climate.
Europe.
Humid subtropical climates are located in relatively small sections of Europe. The Toulouse region of France, and in places along the Adriatic and Black Sea coasts which are too wet for inclusion in the Mediterranean climate schema, inland from these areas there are isolated pockets where the climate is borderline subtropical but these zones are usually classed as oceanic or humid continental. Average summer temperatures in areas of Europe with this climate are generally not as hot as most other subtropical zones around the world, but the growing season can be adequately long.
Some areas of Europe, such as parts of the northeastern interior of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Catalonia, southern France Garonne Valley and Rhone Valley, Adriatic northern Italy, parts of Epirus in Greece around the area of Ioannina, most of the Vardar Valley in the Republic of Macedonia, parts of coastal northern Croatia, coastal Slovenia and Central Serbia fall into this classification. Along the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, Romania, Sochi, Russia and southernmost Ukraine have summers too warm (>22°C in the warmest month) to qualify as oceanic, no freezing month, and enough summer precipitation and sometimes humid conditions to preclude their classification as Mediterranean but rather border on or are sometimes defined as Humid continental climates. All these areas are subject to occasional, in some cases repeated snowfalls and freezes during winter. In the Azores, some islands have this climate, with very mild and rainy winters (> 13°C) and no snowfall, hot summers (> 22 or 23°C) but with no dry season during the warmest period, which means that they can be classified neither as oceanic, nor as Mediterranean, but only as humid subtropical climate, as with Corvo Island.
In many other climate classification systems outside of the Köppen, most of these locations would not be included in the humid subtropical grouping. The higher precipitation and high humidity of summers is not present nearly to the degree that it is in subtropical regions of North America and Asia, making its distinction in Europe all the more difficult.
