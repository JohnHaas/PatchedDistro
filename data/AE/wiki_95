Mollusca

The molluscs or mollusks , compose the large phylum of invertebrate animals known as the phylum Mollusca. Around 85,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized. Molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not only in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. The scientific study of molluscs is called malacology.
The three most universal features defining modern molluscs are a mantle with a significant cavity used for breathing and excretion, the presence of a radula, and the structure of the nervous system. Other than these things, molluscs express great morphological diversity, so many textbooks base their descriptions on a "hypothetical ancestral mollusc" (see image below). This has a single, "limpet-like" shell on top, which is made of proteins and chitin reinforced with calcium carbonate, and is secreted by a mantle covering the whole upper surface. The underside of the animal consists of a single muscular "foot". Although molluscs are coelomates, the coelom tends to be small, and the main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood circulates; their circulatory systems are mainly open. The "generalized" mollusc's feeding system consists of a rasping "tongue", the radula, and a complex digestive system in which exuded mucus and microscopic, muscle-powered "hairs" called cilia play various important roles. The generalized mollusc has two paired nerve cords, or three in bivalves. The brain, in species that have one, encircles the esophagus. Most molluscs have eyes, and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan reproductive system relies on external fertilization, but more complex variations occur. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults.
A striking feature of molluscs is the use of the same organ for multiple functions. For example, the heart and nephridia ("kidneys") are important parts of the reproductive system, as well as the circulatory and excretory systems; in bivalves, the gills both "breathe" and produce a water current in the mantle cavity, which is important for excretion and reproduction.
Good evidence exists for the appearance of gastropods, cephalopods and bivalves in the Cambrian period . However, the evolutionary history both of molluscs' emergence from the ancestral Lophotrochozoa and of their diversification into the well-known living and fossil forms are still subjects of vigorous debate among scientists.
Molluscs have been and still are an important food source for anatomically modern humans, but with a risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as a money in some preindustrial societies.
Mollusc species can also represent hazards or pests for human activities. The bite of the blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of "Octopus apollyon" causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200 million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.
Etymology.
The words mollusc and mollusk are both derived from the French "mollusque", which originated from the Latin "molluscus", from "mollis", soft. "Molluscus" was itself an adaptation of Aristotle's τα μαλακά, "the soft things", which he applied to cuttlefish.
The name Molluscoida was formerly used to denote a division of the animal kingdom containing the brachiopods, bryozoans, and tunicates, the members of the three groups having been supposed to somewhat resemble the molluscs. As it is now known these groups have no relation to molluscs, and very little to one another, the name Molluscoida has been abandoned.
Definition.
The two most universal features of the body structure of molluscs are a mantle with a significant cavity used for breathing and excretion, and the organization of the nervous system. The most abundant metallic element in molluscs is calcium.
Molluscs have developed such a varied range of body structures, it is difficult to find synapomorphies (defining characteristics) to apply to all modern groups. The most general characteristic of molluscs is they are unsegmented and bilaterally symmetrical. The following are present in all modern molluscs:
Other characteristics that commonly appear in textbooks have significant exceptions:
Diversity.
Molluscs have more varied forms than any other animal phylum. They include snails, slugs and other gastropods; clams and other bivalves; squids and other cephalopods; and other lesser-known but similarly distinctive subgroups. The majority of species still live in the oceans, from the seashores to the abyssal zone, but some form a significant part of the freshwater fauna and the terrestrial ecosystems. Molluscs are extremely diverse in tropical and temperate regions, but can be found at all latitudes. About 80% of all known mollusc species are gastropods. Cephalopoda such as squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses are among the neurologically most advanced of all invertebrates. The giant squid, which until recently had not been observed alive in its adult form, is one of the largest invertebrates, but a recently caught specimen of the colossal squid, long and weighing , may have overtaken it.
Freshwater and terrestrial molluscs appear exceptionally vulnerable to extinction. Estimates of the numbers of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, the great majority of mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.
A "generalized mollusc".
Because of the great range of anatomical diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject by describing a hypothetical "generalized mollusc" to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.
The generalized mollusc is bilaterally symmetrical and has a single, "limpet-like" shell on top. The shell is secreted by a mantle covering the upper surface. The underside consists of a single muscular "foot". The visceral mass, or visceropallium, is the soft, nonmuscular metabolic region of the mollusc. It contains the body organs.
Mantle and mantle cavity.
The mantle cavity, a fold in the mantle, encloses a significant amount of space. It is lined with epidermis, and is exposed, according to habitat, to sea, fresh water or air. The cavity was at the rear in the earliest molluscs, but its position now varies from group to group. The anus, a pair of osphradia (chemical sensors) in the incoming "lane", the hindmost pair of gills and the exit openings of the nephridia ("kidneys") and gonads (reproductive organs) are in the mantle cavity. The whole soft body of bivalves lies within an enlarged mantle cavity.
Shell.
The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily absent in a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that consists of mainly chitin and conchiolin (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of "Cobcrephora".
While most mollusc shells are composed mainly of aragonite, those gastropods that lay eggs with a hard shell use calcite (sometimes with traces of aragonite) to construct the eggshells.
The shell consists of three layers: the outer layer (the periostracum) made of organic matter, a middle layer made of columnar calcite, and an inner layer consisting of laminated calcite, often nacreous.
Foot.
The underside consists of a muscular foot, which has adapted to different purposes in different classes. The foot carries a pair of statocysts, which act as balance sensors. In gastropods, it secretes mucus as a lubricant to aid movement. In forms having only a top shell, such as limpets, the foot acts as a sucker attaching the animal to a hard surface, and the vertical muscles clamp the shell down over it; in other molluscs, the vertical muscles pull the foot and other exposed soft parts into the shell. In bivalves, the foot is adapted for burrowing into the sediment; in cephalopods it is used for jet propulsion, and the tentacles and arms are derived from the foot.
Circulation.
Molluscs' circulatory systems are mainly open. Although molluscs are coelomates, their coeloms are reduced to fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses most of the other internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.
The atria of the heart also function as part of the excretory system by filtering waste products out of the blood and dumping it into the coleom as urine. A pair of nephridia ("little kidneys") to the rear of and connected to the coelom extracts any re-usable materials from the urine and dumps additional waste products into it, and then ejects it via tubes that discharge into the mantle cavity.
Respiration.
Most molluscs have only one pair of gills, or even only one gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide the mantle cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle cavity, while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering the mantle cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.
Eating, digestion, and excretion.
Most molluscs have muscular mouths with radulae, "tongues", bearing many rows of chitinous teeth, which are replaced from the rear as they wear out. The radula primarily functions to scrape bacteria and algae off rocks, and is associated with the odontophore, a cartilaginous supporting organ. The radula is unique to the molluscs and has no equivalent in any other animal.
Molluscs' mouths also contain glands that secrete slimy mucus, to which the food sticks. Beating cilia (tiny "hairs") drive the mucus towards the stomach, so the mucus forms a long string called a "food string".
At the tapered rear end of the stomach and projecting slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.
The particles are sorted by yet another group of cilia, which send the smaller particles, mainly minerals, to the prostyle so eventually they are excreted, while the larger ones, mainly food, are sent to the stomach's cecum (a pouch with no other exit) to be digested. The sorting process is by no means perfect.
Periodically, circular muscles at the hindgut's entrance pinch off and excrete a piece of the prostyle, preventing the prostyle from growing too large. The anus, in the part of the mantle cavity, is swept by the outgoing "lane" of the current created by the gills. Carnivorous molluscs usually have simpler digestive systems.
As the head has largely disappeared in bivalves, the mouth has been equipped with labial palps (two on each side of the mouth) to collect the detritus from its mucus.
Nervous system.
Molluscs have two pairs of main nerve cords (three in bivalves) the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Both pairs run below the level of the gut, and include ganglia as local control centers in important parts of the body. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia on both sides of the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The only ganglia above the gut are the cerebral ganglia, which sit above the esophagus (gullet) and handle "messages" from and to the eyes. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are just below the esophagus and their commissure and connections to the cerebral ganglia encircle the esophagus in a nerve ring.
The brain, in species that have one, encircles the esophagus. Most molluscs have a head with eyes, and all have a pair of sensor-containing tentacles, also on the head, that detect chemicals, vibrations and touch.
Reproduction.
The simplest molluscan reproductive system relies on external fertilization, but with more complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart and sheds ova or sperm into the coloem, from which the nephridia extract them and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.
The most basic molluscan larva is a trochophore, which is planktonic and feeds on floating food particles by using the two bands of cilia around its "equator" to sweep food into the mouth, which uses more cilia to drive them into the stomach, which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through the anus. New tissue grows in the bands of mesoderm in the interior, so the apical tuft and anus are pushed further apart as the animal grows. The trochophore stage is often succeeded by a veliger stage in which the prototroch, the "equatorial" band of cilia nearest the apical tuft, develops into the velum ("veil"), a pair of cilia-bearing lobes with which the larva swims. Eventually, the larva sinks to the seafloor and metamorphoses into the adult form. Whilst metamorphosis is the usual state in molluscs, the cephalopods differ in exhibiting direct development: the hatchling is a 'miniaturized' form of the adult.
Ecology.
Feeding.
Most molluscs are herbivorous, grazing on algae or filter feeders. For those grazing, two feeding strategies are predominant. Some feed on microscopic, filamentous algae, often using their radula as a 'rake' to comb up filaments from the sea floor. Others feed on macroscopic 'plants' such as kelp, rasping the plant surface with its radula. To employ this strategy, the plant has to be large enough for the mollusc to 'sit' on, so smaller macroscopic plants are not as often eaten as their larger counterparts.
Filter feeders are molluscs that feed by straining suspended matter and food particle from water, typically by passing the wate over their gills. Most bivalves are filter feeders. 
Cephalopods are primarily predatory, and the radula takes a secondary role to the jaws and tentacles in food acquisition. The monoplacophoran "Neopilina" uses its radula in the usual fashion, but its diet includes protists such as the xenophyophore "Stannophyllum". Sacoglossan sea-slugs suck the sap from algae, using their one-row radula to pierce the cell walls, whereas dorid nudibranchs and some Vetigastropoda feed on sponges and others feed on hydroids. (An extensive list of molluscs with unusual feeding habits is available in the appendix of .)
Classification.
Opinions vary about the number of classes of molluscs; for example, the table below shows eight living classes, and two extinct ones. Although they are unlikely to form a clade, some older works combine the Caudofoveata and solenogasters into one class, the Aplacophora. Two of the commonly recognized "classes" are known only from fossils.
Classification into higher taxa for these groups has been and remains problematic. A phylogenetic study suggests the Polyplacophora form a clade with a monophyletic Aplacophora. Additionally, it suggests a sister taxon relationship exists between the Bivalvia and the Gastropoda.
Evolution.
Fossil record.
Good evidence exists for the appearance of gastropods, cephalopods and bivalves in the Cambrian period . However, the evolutionary history both of the emergence of molluscs from the ancestral group Lophotrochozoa, and of their diversification into the well-known living and fossil forms, is still vigorously debated.
Debate occurs about whether some Ediacaran and Early Cambrian fossils really are molluscs. "Kimberella", from about , has been described as "mollusc-like", but others are unwilling to go further than "probable bilaterian". There is an even sharper debate about whether "Wiwaxia", from about , was a mollusc, and much of this centers on whether its feeding apparatus was a type of radula or more similar to that of some polychaete worms. Nicholas Butterfield, who opposes the idea that "Wiwaxia" was a mollusc, has written that earlier microfossils from are fragments of a genuinely mollusc-like radula. This appears to contradict the concept that the ancestral molluscan radula was mineralized.
However, the Helcionellids, which first appear over in Early Cambrian rocks from Siberia and China, are thought to be early molluscs with rather snail-like shells. Shelled molluscs therefore predate the earliest trilobites. Although most helcionellid fossils are only a few millimeters long, specimens a few centimeters long have also been found, most with more limpet-like shapes. The tiny specimens have been suggested to be juveniles and the larger ones adults.
Some analyses of helcionellids concluded these were the earliest gastropods. However, other scientists are not convinced these Early Cambrian fossils show clear signs of the torsion that identifies modern gastropods twists the internal organs so the anus lies above the head.
"Volborthella", some fossils of which predate , was long thought to be a cephalopod, but discoveries of more detailed fossils showed its shell was not secreted, but built from grains of the mineral silicon dioxide (silica), and it was not divided into a series of compartments by septa as those of fossil shelled cephalopods and the living "Nautilus" are. "Volborthella"'s classification is uncertain. The Late Cambrian fossil "Plectronoceras" is now thought to be the earliest clearly cephalopod fossil, as its shell had septa and a siphuncle, a strand of tissue that "Nautilus" uses to remove water from compartments it has vacated as it grows, and which is also visible in fossil ammonite shells. However, "Plectronoceras" and other early cephalopods crept along the seafloor instead of swimming, as their shells contained a "ballast" of stony deposits on what is thought to be the underside, and had stripes and blotches on what is thought to be the upper surface. All cephalopods with external shells except the nautiloids became extinct by the end of the Cretaceous period . However, the shell-less Coleoidea (squid, octopus, cuttlefish) are abundant today.
The Early Cambrian fossils "Fordilla" and "Pojetaia" are regarded as bivalves. "Modern-looking" bivalves appeared in the Ordovician period, . One bivalve group, the rudists, became major reef-builders in the Cretaceous, but became extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Even so, bivalves remain abundant and diverse.
The Hyolitha are a class of extinct animals with a shell and operculum that may be molluscs. Authors who suggest they deserve their own phylum do not comment on the position of this phylum in the tree of life
Phylogeny.
A possible "family tree" of molluscs (2007). Does not include annelid worms as the analysis concentrated on fossilizable "hard" features.
The phylogeny (evolutionary "family tree") of molluscs is a controversial subject. In addition to the debates about whether "Kimberella" and any of the "halwaxiids" were molluscs or closely related to molluscs, debates arise about the relationships between the classes of living molluscs. In fact, some groups traditionally classified as molluscs may have to be redefined as distinct but related.
Molluscs are generally regarded members of the Lophotrochozoa, a group defined by having trochophore larvae and, in the case of living Lophophorata, a feeding structure called a lophophore. The other members of the Lophotrochozoa are the annelid worms and seven marine phyla. The diagram on the right summarizes a phylogeny presented in 2007.
Because the relationships between the members of the family tree are uncertain, it is difficult to identify the features inherited from the last common ancestor of all molluscs. For example, it is uncertain whether the ancestral mollusc was metameric (composed of repeating units)—if it was, that would suggest an origin from an annelid-like worm. Scientists disagree about this: Giribet and colleagues concluded, in 2006, the repetition of gills and of the foot's retractor muscles were later developments, while in 2007, Sigwart concluded the ancestral mollusc was metameric, and it had a foot used for creeping and a "shell" that was mineralized. In one particular branch of the family tree, the shell of conchiferans is thought to have evolved from the spicules (small spines) of aplacophorans; but this is difficult to reconcile with the embryological origins of spicules.
The molluscan shell appears to have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been impermeable and thus forced the development of more sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.
The evolutionary relationships 'within' the molluscs are also debated, and the diagrams below show two widely supported reconstructions:
Morphological analyses tend to recover a conchiferan clade that receives less support from molecular analyses, although these results also lead to unexpected paraphylies, for instance scattering the bivalves throughout all other mollusc groups.
However, an analysis in 2009 using both morphological and molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic; in particular, Scaphopoda and Bivalvia are both separate, monophyletic lineages unrelated to the remaining molluscan classes; the traditional phylum Mollusca is polyphyletic, and it can only be made monophyletic if scaphopods and bivalves are excluded. A 2010 analysis managed to recover the traditional conchiferan and aculiferan groups, but similarly concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic, this time suggesting the solenogastres are more closely related to the nonmolluscan taxa used as an outgroup than to other molluscs. Current molecular data are insufficient to constrain the molluscan phylogeny, and since the methods used to determine the confidence in clades are prone to overestimation, it is risky to place too much emphasis even on the areas of which different studies agree. Rather than eliminating unlikely relationships, the latest studies add new permutations of internal molluscan relationships, even bringing the conchiferan hypothesis into question.
Human interaction.
For millennia, molluscs have been a source of food for humans, as well as important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, sea silk, and chemical compounds. Their shells have also been used as a form of currency in some preindustrial societies. Their outlandish forms have helped conjure up tales of mythological sea monsters, such as the kraken. A number of species of molluscs can bite or sting humans, and some have become agricultural pests.
Uses by humans.
Molluscs, especially bivalves such as clams and mussels, have been an important food source since at least the advent of anatomically modern humans, and this has often resulted in overfishing. Other commonly eaten molluscs include octopuses and squids, whelks, oysters, and scallops. In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global mollusc catch, netting almost . Within Europe, France remained the industry leader. Some countries regulate importation and handling of molluscs and other seafood, mainly to minimize the poison risk from toxins that accumulate in the animals.
Most molluscs with shells can produce pearls, but only the pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, are valuable. The best natural pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, "Pinctada margaritifera" and "Pinctada mertensi", which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Natural pearls form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.
The two methods of culturing pearls insert either "seeds" or beads into oysters. The "seed" method uses grains of ground shell from freshwater mussels, and overharvesting for this purpose has endangered several freshwater mussel species in the southeastern USA. The pearl industry is so important in some areas, significant sums of money are spent on monitoring the health of farmed molluscs.
Other luxury and high-status products were made from molluscs. Tyrian purple, made from the ink glands of murex shells, "... fetched its weight in silver" in the fourth century BC, according to Theopompus. The discovery of large numbers of "Murex" shells on Crete suggests the Minoans may have pioneered the extraction of "imperial purple" during the Middle Minoan period in the 20th–18th centuries BC, centuries before the Tyrians. Sea silk is a fine, rare, and valuable fabric produced from the long silky threads (byssus) secreted by several bivalve molluscs, particularly "Pinna nobilis", to attach themselves to the sea bed. Procopius, writing on the Persian wars "circa" 550 CE, "stated that the five hereditary satraps (governors) of Armenia who received their insignia from the Roman Emperor were given chlamys (or cloaks) made from "lana pinna" ("Pinna" "wool," or byssus). Apparently, only the ruling classes were allowed to wear these chlamys."
Mollusc shells, including those of cowries, were used as a kind of money (shell money) in several preindustrial societies. However, these "currencies" generally differed in important ways from the standardized government-backed and -controlled money familiar to industrial societies. Some shell "currencies" were not used for commercial transactions, but mainly as social status displays at important occasions, such as weddings. When used for commercial transactions, they functioned as commodity money, as a tradable commodity whose value differed from place to place, often as a result of difficulties in transport, and which was vulnerable to incurable inflation if more efficient transport or "goldrush" behavior appeared.
Bioindicators.
Bivalve molluscs are used as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile so that they are representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. A typical project is the Mussel Watch Programme but today they are used worldwide. 
Stings and bites.
A risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs occurs under certain conditions, and many countries have regulations that aim to minimize this risk. Blue-ringed octopus bites are often fatal, and the bite of other octopuses can cause unpleasant symptoms. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill. However, the sophisticated venoms of these cone snails have become important tools in neurological research and show promise as sources of new medications.
When handled alive, a few species of molluscs can sting or bite and, with some species, this can present a serious risk to the human handling the animal. To put this into perspective, though, deaths from mollusc venoms are less than 10% of the number of deaths from jellyfish stings.
All octopuses are venomous, but only a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus "Hapalochlaena", which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, "Octopus apollyon", causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of "Octopus rubescens" can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.
All species of cone snails are venomous and can sting when handled, although many species are too small to pose much of a risk to humans. These carnivorous gastropods feed on marine invertebrates (and in the case of larger species, on fish). Their venom is based on a huge array of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier; they can afford to do this because their toxins require less time and energy to be produced compared with those of snakes or spiders. Many painful stings have been reported, and a few fatalities, although some of the reported fatalities may be exaggerations. Only a few larger species of cone snails which can capture and kill fish are likely to be seriously dangerous to humans. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.
The traditional belief that a giant clam can trap the leg of a person between its valves, thus causing drowning, is a myth.
Pests.
Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200 million people. A few species of snails and slugs are serious agricultural pests; in addition, accidental or deliberate introduction of various snail species into new territory has resulted in serious damage to some natural ecosystems.
Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by the fluke worm "Schistosoma", is "second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries. An estimated 200 million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease — 100 million in Africa alone." The parasite has 13 known species, two of which infect humans. The parasite itself is not a mollusc, but all the species have freshwater snails as intermediate hosts.
Some species of molluscs, particularly certain snails and slugs, can be serious crop pests, and when introduced into new environments, can unbalance local ecosystems. One such pest, the giant African snail "Achatina fulica", has been introduced to many parts of Asia, as well as to many islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In the 1990s, this species reached the West Indies. Attempts to control it by introducing the predatory snail "Euglandina rosea" proved disastrous, as the predator ignored "Achatina fulica" and went on to extirpate several native snail species, instead.
Despite its name, "Molluscum contagiosum" is a viral disease, and is unrelated to molluscs.

Palmer Bikeway

The Palmer Bikeway is a system of trails in Palmer Township, Pennsylvania. These include a towpath adjacent to the Lehigh River, along with extensions that go up through residential areas of the township. The bikeway is connected to other trails which extend into the cities of Easton and Bethlehem, and goes through a corner of Wilson Borough. The northern portion of the trail, which extends from Penn Pump Park to Tatamy Borough parallel to the Bushkill Creek, will eventually be linked to the rest of the Bikeway via an unbuilt section between Northwood Avenue (at Penn Pump Park) and Bushkill Park Drive (just northeast of Bushkill Park). Once an undeveloped portion of trail between Tatamy and Stockertown Borough is completed, the Palmer Bikeway will connect with the Plainfield Township Trail, creating a regional trail system.
Historical Development.
Initial Construction.
The original idea for the Palmer Bikeway first came about in the late 1970s as a result of a United States Department of the Interior program to create walking and bicycle trails from many abandoned rail lines across the nation. Under the leadership of officials from Palmer and Bethlehem Townships the project received a grant of $480,400, the second largest grant under the program.
2000 - 2010.
In 2001 the township received additional grant money for the completion of a three mile section of the trail along the Bushkill Creek in the northern section of the township. This section goes north from Penn Pump Park to the township's border with Tatamy. In 2002, following the completion of the Rt. 33 extension, a two mile section of path was completed west of Riverview Park along the Lehigh River. This section eliminated the need to traverse the steep grades from Chain Dam Road when traveling from Riverview Park.
2011 and beyond.
As additional funding becomes available the recently completed 3 mile section will be connected to the original 7.8 mile path. Additional connections to other local trails in Wilson, Plainfield and Forks Townships will also be made. 
Along the trail.
Maintenance.
The Bike Path is owned by Bethlehem and Palmer townships and is maintained year-round by the Palmer Township Parks Department. Local community groups will occasionally sponsor improvements to the trail as well, such as a recent Eagle Scout project to place clearly visible mile markers along the main section of the bike path. 
Amenities.
The trail passes through two public parks, both of which contain bathrooms, picnic facilities, playground equipment, and parking. There is another parking lot and a public boat launch accessible from Hope Rd.

Arthur Colefax

Sir Henry Arthur Colefax, KC (9 July 1866–19 February 1936) was a British patent lawyer and Conservative Party politician.
Colefax was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, and was the son of J S Colefax, a woollen merchant. He was initially educated at Bradford Grammar School before studying natural science and chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, and at Merton and Christ Church Colleges at the University of Oxford.
In 1894 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and quickly became an acknowledged expert on patent law. He was made a King's Counsel in 1912. 
At the January 1910 general election he was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester South West, benefiting from a split in anti-Conservative vote between the Social Democratic Federation and Liberal candidates. He held the seat for less than a year, and was defeated at ensuing election in December. 
Much of his work was involved in Anglo-German patents, but this was ended by outbreak of the First World War. He became head of the scientific department of the Ministry of Munitions for the duration of the war. He was knighted for his wartime services in 1920.
In 1918 he was appointed as solicitor-general of the County Palatine of Durham, becoming Chancellor of the Chancery Court of the Palatine in 1930. These offices had been almost entirely ceremonial since 1837.
In 1901 he married Sibyl Halsey, and they had two sons. Sibyl Colefax was to become a renowned interior designer.
Colefax died from pneumonia at his Chelsea home in 1936, aged 69.

Mike Chaplin

Michael James Chaplin (Mike) NDD, RWS, RE, FRSA (born 19 September 1943) is a British artist, known primarily for his work in the mediums of etching and watercolour. He was guest art expert on the Channel 4 art programme Watercolour Challenge with Hannah Gordon.
Life.
Mike was born at Little Barford, to the south of St. Neots, in Huntingdonshire (now part of Bedfordshire), and attended primary school in Sandy, Bedfordshire.
In the early 1950s, he moved with his parents and older sister to Harpenden, on the outskirts of St Albans in Hertfordshire. His love of art was already starting to develop. 
He attended St Albans Boys' Grammar School (since renamed Verulam School) and was a contemporary there of Colin Blunstone and Chris White, who later formed the pop group The Zombies. In fact, Mike was the guitarist in an earlier band, along with Colin Coke and Chris White, called the Markysparks, in reference to Markyate, Chris White's home town. 
Leaving school, and following a spell of working in the art department of his Alma Mater, Mike studied graphic design at Watford School of Art, gaining his National Diploma of Design. He followed this up with a postgraduate course in Printmaking at Brighton school of art, now The Faculty of Arts and Architecture, part of the University of Brighton. 
After completing his studies, Mike moved with his wife Gay, a teacher and artist in her own right, to Maidstone, in Kent, where they are still based. They have one son, Nicholas (b. 1977) and one daughter, Briony (b. 1980).
In 1971, at the age of 28, Mike was elected as an associate of The Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers (at that time known as the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers), becoming one of the youngest people ever to receive this accolade. He was later elected to full membership, subsequently serving as Honorary Secretary and Vice President, and is now a senior fellow of the society.
In 1997, having been an associate since 1993, Mike was elected to Full Member of the Royal Watercolour Society. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.
Career.
1960.
Mike's first work as a professional artist was to create woodcut pictures for the dust-jackets of books, while still a student. He became a professional artist in his own right at the end of 1960s, selling his first picture for seven Guineas. His earliest pieces in his own right were almost exclusively in the medium of etching. The influence of Mike's background in graphic design is very clear to see in these first pictures, which are highly stylised, bordering on abstract. Already at this stage, however, Mike's love of architecture, particularly industrial, was becoming apparent. (An early etching depicts the workings of a disused power station, a theme which Mike would revisit later in his career.)
Mike’s work, both in painting and printmaking, has made him one of Britain’s most well known painters, and he is represented in many public and private collections worldwide, including those of HM The Queen, HM The Queen Mother, ex-King Constantine of the Hellenes, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and the Daily Express (mural for the Boardroom).
Mike achieved great popularity as resident art expert on the hit Channel 4 programme Watercolour Challenge with Hannah Gordon. With 3 series and over 60 programmes, Mike reached an audience of over 1 million . He also filmed an hour-long follow-up video, which was made to accompany the series.
2002.
He was commissioned to produce a series of handling sheets of watercolour techniques for the Tate Gallery to accompany the Thomas Girtin Exhibition (Summer 2002) and demonstrated painting techniques during the El Greco Exhibition at the National Gallery (2004).
2003-2005.
2003 saw Mike filming for BBC2's Open University Art History Unit, following in the steps of J. M. W. Turner and re-creating some of his paintings of the Lake District. In 2005 Mike again worked with the Tate Gallery recording audio notes on the Turner exhibits for the acclaimed Turner, Whistler & Monet exhibition.
2007.
In 2007 Mike was given the enormous privilege of using J M W Turner's pigments to be ground by him into watercolour. The paint was subsequently used by him for filming Turner's watercolour techniques for a permanent exhibition at Tate Britain in London. 
Mike loves teaching adults of all ability levels on residential courses in Britain and abroad.
2011.
Mike worked with the family of J M W Turner to establish the Turner Award for Watercolour as part of the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and was himself the recipient of the award in 2011.
He has had two books published, 'Mike Chaplin's Expressive Watercolours' and 'The Complete Book of Drawing and Painting'. In 2010, he presented a DVD, The Challenge of Watercolour.

Caging (direct mail)

In the direct mail industry, a caging list is a list/database of addresses, updated after a mailing program is completed, with notations on responses, with corrections for addresses for which mail has been returned as undeliverable or forwarded.
In third-party direct mail fundraising, a caging agent receives contributions, processes donor mail and "deposits all contributions to the client's account", according to Eberle Associates, a United States direct mail and political fundraising firm.
The Association of Fundraising Professionals similarly defines caging as "the process or act of collecting donations by an entity other than the not-for-profit organization for which they were solicited."
Often the processing of responses to direct mail is conducted by a third party hired to perform various services, which may include processing payments, compiling product orders, correcting recipient addresses, processing returned mail, providing lockbox services and depositing funds and the associated data processing for each of these services. "Caging" is a shorthand term for this service bundle. The term may be a derivative of the financial teller cage, since operations related to lockbox services involve the control and protection of funds.
The personal information gathered about respondents may be more valuable than the donations received, or purchases made. Mal Warwick Associates explains that "caging" allows an organization to exploit "information that can be gleaned" from a direct mail campaign. "Information from the caging process is often massaged and manipulated six ways from Sunday, all in hopes of finding a productive new mailing list, marginally improving a letter's results, or cutting its cost by a few pennies."
"Direct Magazine" adds that caging is also called "secure response management." The quality of response data—and how those data might be used—is directly proportional to pre-mail planning, which includes labor-saving devices like matched barcodes and other methods for "all digital workflow."

Xalapa Cathedral

Xalapa Cathedral or in full, Catedral Metropolitana de la Immaculada Concepción de Xalapa is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city of Xalapa, Veracruz, in eastern Mexico. The see of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Xalapa, it is one of the oldest constructions of the city. 
The cathedral was originally built in 1641, but in 1772 it underwent massive change that reconstructed it in the baroque style. Some details in some parts of cathedral remain from this, including the bell tower. The clock itself was imported from England. The consecration of the status of cathedral was announced in 1864, coinciding with the creation of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Xalapa to support it. In 1896, it underwent further modification forming an appearance, much of which remains today.

Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company

The Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company ("Nordhausen-Wernigeroder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft") or NWE was the second railway company to be founded in the Harz mountains in Germany, after the Gernrode-Harzgerode Railway Company ("Gernroder-Harzgeroder Eisenbahn"). On 15 June 1896 the "NWE" was formed by the "Vereinigten Eisenbahnbau- und Betriebs-Gesellschaft" in Berlin, who also ran its operations. As early as 1896 the first section of this narrow gauge Harz Railway ('Harzquerbahn') was opened, followed by the Brocken Railway ("Brockenbahnin") 1898, which was also narrow gauge. On 1 April 1908, the "NWE" took over operations from the "Vereinigten Eisenbahnbau- und Betriebsgesellschaft".
The junction with the Gernroder-Harzgerode railway (the Selke Valley Railway or "Selketalbahn") was in Eisfelder Talmühle and that with the South Harz Railway ("Südharzeisenbahn") was in Sorge. At Nordhausen and Wernigerode stations there were junctions with the standard gauge trains of the Prussian state railways, later the Deutsche Reichsbahn. At Drei-Annen-Hohne was a connexion with the Halberstadt-Blankenburg railway. 
Around 1925 the "NWE" had about 250 employees and about 100 seasonal workers. From 1926 the NWE also ran bus routes (known as the "Harzer Roller" or 'Harz rollers'). Its workshop and management was located in Wernigerode.
The NWE was expropriated by a 'people's decision' and went into the Saxony-Anhalt state railways in 1948. The two routes were run by the DR from 1949. Since 1993 the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways ("Harzer Schmalspurbahnen") has been the owner and operator of the Harz Railway, Brocken Railway and Selke Valley Railway.

Opel Olympia Rekord

The Opel Olympia Rekord was a two door family car which replaced the Opel Olympia in March 1953. Innovations included the strikingly modern Ponton format body-work incorporating numerous styling features from the USA and large amounts of chrome decoration both on the outside and on the inside.
The car was offered till 1957. Unusually, at least in European terms, the manufacturer followed the example of General Motors in Detroit by applying an annual facelift. There was a new front grill every year along with other detailed modifications to the trim. The policy of annual facelifts ensured plenty of publicity, and the car was a commercial success, achieving second place in the West German sales charts year after year, beaten to the top slot only by the much smaller, less costly and at this time seemingly unstoppable Volkswagen. Around 580,000 Olympia Rekords were produced. Opel boss Edward Zdunek justified the annual facelifts with the explanation that they gave customers the possibility of "sozialen Differenzierung" (social differentiation). Nevertheless, commentators also noted that the Detroit inspired annual face-lift disadvantaged owners because it depressed second hand values for the Olympia Rekord. The Olympia Rekord set a pattern that Opel would follow for many decades, providing a lot more car for the money than most competitor manufacturers.
By contrast to the modern and annually modified bodywork, the 1488 cc ohc four cylinder water cooled engine was very little changed since it had first been offered in the Opel Olympia back in 1937. When the Olympia Rekord first appeared in 1953 maximum power output of 40 hp (29 kW) at 3800 rpm was claimed. This was increased at the end of 1955 for the 1956 model year to 45 hp (33 kW) at 3900 rpm. At the same time there was a marginal increase in maximum torque, and the compression ratio was raised from 6.5:1 to 6.9:1. The 1950s was a decade during which minimum fuel octanes were raised progressively across western Europe: the manufacturer continued to specify "normal" grade fuel for the Olympia Rekord throughout its life.
The Name.
The car retained the "Olympia" name, originally applied in 1935 to the predecessor model in anticipation of the 1936 Olympic Games. The Olympia had been a defining model for Opel, featuring then revolutionary monocoque body construction, and intended to be produced in huge numbers at a time when the national economy was finally seen to be on a sustained upswing. Adding the name "Rekord" in 1953 built on the theme of sporting success, and reflected a spirit of optimism which the model's marketplace performance would justify.
Evolution.
1953/54.
The Opel Olympia Rekord was introduced with a new generously proportioned body and an old 1,488 cc engine in March 1953. The top seller, by far, was the two-door saloon. From August 1953 Opel also offered a 2-door cabriolet (""Cabrio-Limouisine"") which, despite costing only an extra DM 300, sold in very small numbers. Also available from August was a 3-door estate which Opel branded as the Opel Olympia Rekord CarAVan. The resulting eleven syllable name was evidently no handicap in the marketplace, since the "Caravan" name would turn up on many subsequent Opel estate models. The styling was upbeat and an unapologetic tribute to the designs that General Motors were producing in Detroit, with a particularly striking open mouthed front grill which reminded commentators of a shark's mouth (der "Haifischmaul-Kuelhergrill"). Some customers may have been irritated that all the cars were delivered with their standard steel wheels painted black regardless of the colour of the car body, although sellers of after-market wheel trims were no doubt delighted by Opel's cost-cutting approach to painting the car's wheels.
The advertised price in Germany was DM 6,410 for the 2-door "Limousine" (sedan) and DM 6,710 for the "Cabrio-Limousine" and "Caravan" (estate). By July 1954 Opel had produced 113,966 "Limousine" (sedan) or "Cabrio-Limousine" Olympia Rekords along with 15,804 "Caravan" (estate) versions and 6,258 Olympia Rekord panel vans.
1954/55.
Production of the first Olympia Rekord ended in July 1954 and in late summer 1954 the mildly facelifted 1955 car was presented. The advertised power output of the 1,488 cc engine was unchanged at 40 hp (29 kW) despite a slight increase in the compression ratio from 6.3:1 to 6.5:1. The back window grew in size and the front grill was modified, through he addition of a single thick horizontal bar across the hitherto "open-mouthed" grill. This new adornment earned for the 1956 model, when coloured green, the soubriquet "Gurkenraspel" "("cucumber grill")".
A new base model was offered at DM5, 850, which was slightly above DM 1,000 more expensive than the market leading Volkswagen. Opel's new entry level family car also received a reduced name, being badged simply as the Opel Olympia, while the other models in the range continued with the Opel Olympia Rekord name. The 1955 model year also saw the introduction of a light panel van version.
1955/56.
The 1956 model, introduced towards the end of 1955, featured simplified bumpers from which the over-riders had disappeared. The hitherto "open-mouthed" grill was now filled with closely packed thin vertical bars. Further price reductions followed the trend also followed by other German auto-makers during the mid-1950s and the advertised German market price for the 1956 model ranged from 5,410 to 6,560. The old 1,488 cc engine was also upgraded with a further increase in the compression ratio, now to 6.9:1, and advertised maximum power was increased to 45 hp (33 kW). In other respects the old engine was very little changed.
In July 1956 the 2-door cabriolet version was withdrawn. It had not sold well: the few survivors are much prized by enthusiasts and collectors half a century later.
1956/57.
The 1957 model appeared in July 1956. The grill was again modified, the roof was slightly flattened and the exterior acquired even more chrome embellishment. Although the company had previously shunned significant mechanical changes when making their annual upgrades, they did now introduced an all-synchromesh gear-box.
German market advertised prices now stood between DM 5,510 and 6,560. By way of comparison, 1957 was the year that Volkswagen finally managed to sink the price of their entry level Beetle to just below DM 4,000.
The Opel Olympia Rekord was superseded in August 1957 by the new, larger and more flamboyantly styled Rekord P1 which would for the first time be offered with four doors. The 1937 Opel Olympia engine would continue to power entry level Opel Rekord models till 1965, however.
Commercial.
During the four-year period between 1953 and 1957 Opel recorded production of 582,924 Olympia Rekords, with the rate accelerating markedly in 1957. It was still produced at about half the rate of the Volkswagen Beetle, but it was repeatedly Germany’s second best seller, and the first of a long line of Opel’s that would outsell competitor vehicles from Ford, both in Germany and in key European export markets. During six years from 1952 to 1958 Ford recorded production of 564,863 Taunus 12Ms and 15Ms which were comparable to the middle weight Opel in many ways, though half a class down in terms of price and (at least in the case of the 12M version) power.

Waldo's Last Stand

"Waldo's Last Stand" is a 1940 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by Edward Cahn. It was the 193rd "Our Gang" short (194th episode, 105th talking short, 106th talking episode, and 25th MGM produced episode) that was released.
Plot.
The gang (Spanky, Alfalfa, Darla, Buckwheat, and Mickey) offers to help their pal Waldo attract customers to his lemonade stand. Redecorating their barn as a lavish nightclub, the kids stage an elaborate floor show, with Darla Hood as the star vocalist. Unfortunately, their efforts attract only one patron—a surly, stone-faced little kid (Billy "Froggy" Laughlin, making one of his first Our Gang appearances). Spanky and the other kids try to persuade Froggy into buying a drink, even going as far as singing an impromptu song about dryness and thirst, but to no avail. The kids then come up with an idea: to put a heater under Froggy which would heat him up and force him to buy a drink. When the floor show ends, Spanky asks Froggy why he wouldn't buy a drink and the latter responds, with a Popeye-the-Sailor voice, that he doesn't have any money and that it's to hot in the barn; he then leaves. Spanky then realizes that the reason Waldo had no customers (kids) was because they were all in the floor show. The entire gang, including Waldo and a donkey, laughs as the short ends.

Charles Caruana

Charles Caruana CBE (9 October 1932, Gibraltar – 1 October 2010, Gibraltar) was a Gibraltarian Roman Catholic bishop of Maltese descent. He was appointed sixth Roman Catholic Bishop of Gibraltar on 14 February 1998 and ordained on 24 May 1998. His retirement request was accepted on 18 March 2010. He died at St Bernard's Hospital, Gibraltar on 1 October 2010 following a bout of ill health.
Early life.
Charles Caruana was born on 9 October 1932 in the British colony of Gibraltar (now a British overseas territory). His ancestors were part of a group of Caruanas that settled in Gibraltar from their home in Malta during the 1800s. His great grandfather moved to Gibraltar with his grandfather and his four great uncles. This rendered Caruana a second-generation Gibraltarian. At the time of his birth, his family lived in Lynch's Lane, just off Main Street.
During World War II he was evacuated with his family to London where he spent six months in Notting Hill Gate tube station seeking shelter from the bombings. He was first educated by the Christian Brothers when he was later re-evacuated to Northern Ireland. He already felt a religious calling by the age of 13 to 14, wanting to become a Christian Brother himself. On his return to Gibraltar, he joined the civil service, working in the Central Employment Exchange for four years.
Priesthood.
Caruana eventually went off to a Seminary in the United Kingdom, where he spent six years studying. He was ordained on 24 May 1959 starting work in the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned and later at the Sacred Heart Church, where he remained parish priest for 12 years. He later returned to the Cathedral to take on the role of administrator. He also spent some time as prison chaplain at Moorish Castle.
Roman Catholic Bishop of Gibraltar.
On 14 February 1999, Father Caruana was the second Gibraltarian to have been appointed Roman Catholic Bishop of Gibraltar by Pope John Paul II. He was ordained Bishop on 24 May of the same year. On his birthday in 2007 he tendered his resignation to the Holy See, according to canon law provisos. On 18 March 2010 the Holy See announced that his resignation had been accepted and his successor as Bishop of Gibraltar would be the English redemptorist priest Ralph Heskett.
Honours.
Bishop Caruana was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2008, receiving the award from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in March 2008. He was also invested in 2003 by HRH Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, as an Knight Commander of Grace of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George.
In December 2011 Polish President Bronisław Komorowski posthumously awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.
"Bishop Caruana Road" on Gibraltar is named in his honour.
Gibraltar Song Festival.
Bishop Caruana was instrumental in initiating the Gibraltar Song Festival. He first thought of the idea as a way of raising funds to build the Community Centre. The festival became so successful that the festival was to become an annual event.
Works.
Bishop Caruana is the author of several books about his home town. In 1989 he published "The Rock Under A Cloud". In 2009, he authored "History of Our Lady of Europe", a book published by the Vatican Press as part of the commemoration of the 700 years of devotion of Our Lady of Europe, one of the Catholic patron saints of Gibraltar.
Death.
Bishop Emeritus Caruana died at St Bernard's Hospital on Friday 1 October 2010 at around 6 am. He had been in and out of hospital as he had been in poor health for a number of months but his health is believed to have deteriorated rapidly following a fall just over a week prior to his death, just 8 days before his 78th birthday. Flags around Gibraltar, like those at the Moorish Castle, No. 6 Convent Place, The Convent and other public buildings were flown at half-mast as a symbol of respect. His body, robed in his full pontificals, lay in state at the Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes in the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned until his funeral, allowing the public to file past the catafalque to pay their respects. His funeral was on Tuesday 4 October 2010 at John Mackintosh Square, where his body was carried in procession from the Cathedral. After the service he was buried in the crypt beneath the Cathedral.

Zhenfeng Pagoda

The Zhenfeng Pagoda () in Anqing City, Anhui Province, People's Republic of China, is a pagoda originally built in 1570 during the Ming Dynasty. Due to its location near a bend in the Yangtze River, the pagoda was formerly used as a lighthouse, and contains niches for lanterns. 
After construction, the pagoda was initially called the "Ten-thousand Buddha" (万佛塔) pagoda due to its interior containing over six hundred statues of the Buddha.
Structure.
Built of brick and tall, each of the pagoda's seven stories has seven corners, thereby creating a heptagon. Above the windows on each floor are a set of flying eaves. From the first to the sixth floor, arched doorways lead to an outside balcony. A total of 168 stairs inside the pagoda allow access to the top floor. The walls are tapered slightly, shaping the structure into a partial cone.

What a Catch, Donnie

"What a Catch, Donnie" is Fall Out Boy's second digital download single and third radio single from their fourth studio album "Folie à Deux" (2008). It was first released as part of the build up to the new album on iTunes on October 14, 2008 and charted on the US and Canadian singles charts. The track features numerous musicians performing cameo appearances in the song, singing lines from past Fall Out Boy songs. Bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz has said that he wrote the song to remind himself of vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump. Musically it is one of the band's very few ballads. Fall Out Boy played the song live on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon".
Music video.
The music video was dedicated to Atlanta rapper Dolla who was shot and killed a few months before the song's release.
The band shot the video for the song on July 1, 2009 with Alan Ferguson. On June 30, bassist Pete Wentz posted on his Twitter that the band had 'wrapped up' a video for "What a Catch, Donnie". On July 2, guitarist Joe Trohman stated via Twitter that they had finished shooting the video, editing will take place in the next couple days, and the video was released on MTV on August 6, 2009.
The video also includes Spencer Smith and Brendon Urie from Panic! at the Disco. The two also appeared in the official music video for Fall Out Boy's "A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More "Touch Me"" as some of the dandies, and were also featured in the video for "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet".
Pete Wentz said in a press statement: -
"It is my time to say that we haven't done a video like this before, a video dedicated to someone's death, the death of our best friend and rapper, Dolla (Roderick Anthony Burton II). We hope to shoot the video for "What a Catch, Donnie" in the same place he was shot and also bring our friends round for the climax."
The official music video was released August 6, 2009 on MTV, MTV2, mtvU, and MTV Hits.
The video depicts lead singer Patrick Stump alone at sea trying to find his way home. Throughout most of the video he is fishing, reading in his cabin, playing the piano and suffering from loneliness. Eventually, he finds a seagull trapped in ropes on his ship. He frees and befriends the bird and so the two set sail together and Patrick is no longer lonely. Towards the end of the video, Patrick starts to fish again but finds strange objects such as deer antlers (from Antler Boy in "Sugar, We're Goin Down"), a black and white striped jacket (the jacket Patrick wore in "Dance, Dance"), and a bass drum (one of Andy Hurley's drums). Finally, he comes across a sign featuring the letters F, O, and B (the sign from "Thnks fr th Mmrs"). He then looks up and spots a white casket (from the music video for "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race") as well as a sinking ship. He immediately turns the boat around to rescue the survivors on the lifeboats (who include Joe Trohman, Andy Hurley, Spencer Smith, Brendon Urie, and everyone else (except Pete Wentz) who has worked with Fall Out Boy over the past few years). After all of the survivors are on the boat celebrating because they were rescued, Patrick looks out at the sinking ship. In the top right corner you can see a man assumed to be the captain in a white uniform saluting. This man is supposedly Pete Wentz, and he had a close up in the original video but was edited out. Once all of the survivors are on the boat, and getting closer to shore, Patrick sets free his Seagull friend and watches him fly off with his family into the coast. At the end of the song it also depicts some of their greatest hits. In the background they sing chorus lines from their songs "Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy", "Sugar We're Goin Down", "Dance, Dance", "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", "Thnks fr th Mmrs", and "Growing Up".
The version of this video was that released on iTunes is missing the portion where Pete Wentz says "Thank You" to Patrick Stump. On the commentary of the "Believers Never Die - Greatest Hits" bonus DVD, the band states that this part was left out because of the poor CGI special effects.
It's also considered as one of the only official ballads Fall Out Boy has ever released and/or written. As said in an interview, Pete Wentz said that the song was written in thoughts of his friendship with the lead singer Patrick Stump. He wanted to show his fondness towards "one of his best friends in the business". Although the band were on hiatus (which stretched between 2009 and 2013), Wentz and Stump still supported each other's new music releases.
Cameo appearances.
"What a Catch, Donnie" features a long line-up of guest artists. Towards the end of the song from 3:48–4:25, lead singers from other Decaydance bands can be heard singing lyrics from other Fall Out Boy singles, behind the main vocals. The songs and artists are as follow:
At 3:00 Elvis Costello sings the overture "I will never end up like him, behind my back I already am..." of Fall Out Boy's song "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet". On the band's "Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits" album, Fall Out Boy vocalist Patrick Stump sings the line on the song as the legal agreements were not made in time.
Also, the title of the song is a reference to Donnie Hathaway and his writing partner, Roberta Flack, is mentioned several times throughout the song.

<doc id="19773787" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19773787" title="Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery">
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a type of thoracic surgery performed using a small video camera that is introduced into the patient's chest via a scope. The surgeon is able to view the instruments that are being used along with the anatomy on which the surgeon is operating. The camera and instruments are inserted through separate holes in the chest wall also known as "ports". These small ports are advantageous because the chance for infection and wound dehiscence are drastically reduced. This allows for a faster recovery by the patient and a greater chance for the wound to heal.
Traditionally, thoracic surgery performed for diagnosis or treatment of chest conditions has required access to the chest through thoracotomy or sternotomy incisions. Sternotomy requires the use of a sternal saw to divide the sternum and requires spreading of the divided portions of the sternum with a sternal retractor to allow for visualization of the thoracic structures, passage of instruments into the chest, and removal of specimens. Thoracotomy, as most commonly performed, requires division of one or more major muscles of the chest wall including the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis or serratus muscles, along with spreading of the ribs with a rib spreader. Because the joints of the ribs with the vertebral bodies have only limited flexibility, the use of a rib spreader usually results in rib fractures in the process of rendering the interspace between the ribs wide enough to perform diagnostic or therapeutic maneuvers. Because of this, thoracic surgeons generally intentionally remove a section of one or more ribs in an effort to prevent splintered rib fractures associated with the use of a rib spreader. Sternotomy and thoracotomy have been proven over decades to provide highly effective means of access to thoracic structures and in general are tolerated by patients. However, both incisions have the potential for causing significant pain that may last for extended periods and both result in bony fractures that require a minimum of six weeks to heal during which time patients must refrain from heavy lifting or strenuous activity. The great advantage of VATS over sternotomy or thoracotomy is avoidance of muscle division and bone fractures that allows for diminished duration and intensity of pain and a shorter time to return to full activity.
VATS came into widespread use beginning in the early 1990s. Operations that traditionally were carried out with thoracotomy or sternotomy that today can be performed with VATS include: biopsy for diagnosis of pulmonary, pleural or mediastinal pathology; decortication for empyema; pleurodesis for recurrent pleural effusions or spontaneous pneumothorax; surgical stapler assisted wedge resection of lung masses; resection of mediastinal or pleural masses; thoracic sympathectomy for hyperhidrosis; operations for diaphragmatic hernias or paralysis; esophageal resection or resection of esophageal masses or diverticula; and VATS lobectomy/mediastinal lymphadenectomy for lung cancer.
The instrumentation for VATS includes the use of a camera-linked 5mm or 10mm fiber-optic scope, with or without a 30 degree angle of visualization, and either conventional thoracic instruments or laparoscopic instruments. Unlike with laparoscopy, carbon dioxide insufflation is not generally required with VATS due to the inherent vault-like shape of the thoracic cavity. However, lung deflation on the side of the chest where VATS is being performed is a must to be able to visualize and pass instruments into the thorax; this is usually effected with a double-lumen endo-tracheal tube that allows for single lung ventilation or a bronchial blocker delivered via a standard single-lumen endotracheal tube.
Similarly to laparoscopy, VATS has enjoyed widespread use for technically straightforward operations such as pulmonary decortication, pleurodesis, and lung or pleural biopsies, while more technically demanding operations such as esophageal operations, mediastinal mass resections, or pulmonary lobectomy for early stage lung cancer, have been slower to catch on and have tended to remain confined to selected centers. It is expected that advanced VATS techniques will continue to grow in numbers spurred by patient demand and greater surgeon comfort with the techniques.

Sir Christopher Thomas Needham (30 August 1866 – 29 April 1944) was a British businessman and Liberal politician.
Needham was educated at Manchester Grammar School and the University of Manchester. He was to maintain a link with the university throughout his life, becoming a governor in 1908, a chairman of the council from 1936 to 1941. He became a partner in the family company, John Needham and Sons of Manchester, iron and steel merchants. 
He stood as Liberal candidate for the constituency of Manchester South West at the January 1910 general election, but was defeated by the Conservative, Arthur Colefax. The position was reversed at the ensuing election in December, when Needham unseated Colefax to become a member of parliament. He held the seat until 1918.
After leaving parliament, Needham was knighted in 1919, and expanded his business interests. He became chairman of the Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company in 1922. He remained chairman of the company (renamed the District Bank) until 1936. He was chairman of the National Boiler and General Insurance Company and was also a director of the London and North Eastern Railway, the Manchester Ship Canal and the Alliance Assurance company. Outside of business, he was chairman of Lancashire County Cricket Club from 1941 to 1943.
He married Florence White in 1902, and they had one daughter before her death in 1905. Sir Christopher Needham died at his home in West Didsbury in 1944, aged 77.

Hominidae

The Hominidae (; also known as (humans and the) great apes) form a taxonomic family of primates, including four extant genera:
The term "hominid" is also used in the more restricted sense as hominins or "humans and relatives of humans closer than chimpanzees". In this usage, all hominid species other than "Homo sapiens" are extinct.
A number of known extinct genera are grouped with humans in the Homininae subfamily, others with orangutans in the Ponginae subfamily. The most recent common ancestor of the Hominidae lived roughly 14 million years ago, when the ancestors of the orangutans speciated from the ancestors of the other three genera. The ancestors of the Hominidae family had already speciated from those of the Hylobatidae family, perhaps 15 million to 20 million years ago.
History.
In the early Miocene, about 22 million years ago, the many kinds of arboreally adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification. Fossils at 20 million years ago include fragments attributed to "Victoriapithecus", the earliest Old World Monkey. Among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13 million years ago are "Proconsul", "Rangwapithecus", "Dendropithecus", "Limnopithecus", "Nacholapithecus", "Equatorius", "Nyanzapithecus", "Afropithecus", "Heliopithecus", and "Kenyapithecus", all from East Africa. The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids of middle Miocene age from sites far distant—"Otavipithecus" from cave deposits in Namibia, and "Pierolapithecus" and "Dryopithecus" from France, Spain and Austria—is evidence of a wide diversity of forms across Africa and the Mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the early and middle Miocene. The youngest of the Miocene hominoids, "Oreopithecus", is from coal beds in Italy that have been dated to 9 million years ago.
Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons (family Hylobatidae) diverged from great apes some 18–12 million years ago, and that of orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other great apes at about 12 million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown South East Asian hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by "Sivapithecus" from India and "Griphopithecus" from Turkey, dated to around 10 million years ago.
Species close to the last common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans may be represented by "Nakalipithecus" fossils found in Kenya and "Ouranopithecus" found in Greece. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4 million years ago, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzees and bonobos (genus "Pan") split off from the line leading to the humans; human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see human evolutionary genetics). The fossil record of gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos is limited. Poor preservation in certain conditions (e.g. rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone) contributes to this problem and to sampling bias. Other hominins likely adapted to the drier environments outside the equatorial belt, along with antelopes, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, and horses. The wet equatorial belt contracted after about 8 million years ago. There is very little fossil evidence for the split of the hominin lineage from the lineages of gorillas and "Pan" (chimpanzees and bonobos). The earliest fossils that have been argued to belong to the human lineage are "Sahelanthropus tchadensis" (7 Ma) and "Orrorin tugenensis" (6 Ma), followed by "Ardipithecus" (5.5–4.4 Ma), with species "Ar. kadabba" and "Ar. ramidus".
Taxonomic history.
[[File:Akha cropped hires.JPG|thumb|right|
Humans are one of the four extant hominid genera.]]
The classification of the great apes has been revised several times in the last few decades. These various revisions have led to a varied use of the word "hominid" – the original meaning of Hominidae referred only to the modern meaning of Hominini, i.e. only humans and their closest relatives. The meaning of the taxon changed gradually, leading to the modern meaning of "hominid", which includes all great apes and humans.
The primatological term hominid is easily confused with a number of very similar words:
Many scientists, including paleoanthropologists, continue to use the term hominid to mean humans and their direct and near-direct bipedal ancestors.
As mentioned, Hominidae was originally the name given to humans and their extinct relatives, with the other great apes being placed in a separate family, the Pongidae. However, that definition made Pongidae paraphyletic because at least one great ape species appears to be more closely related to humans than to other great apes. Most taxonomists nowadays encourage monophyletic groups – this would require the use of Pongidae to be restricted to one of the great ape groups (containing "Pongo", the orangutans) only. Thus, many biologists consider Hominidae to include Pongidae as the subfamily Ponginae, or restrict the latter to the orangutans and their extinct relatives, such as "Gigantopithecus". The taxonomy shown here follows the monophyletic groupings according to the modern understanding of human and great ape relationships.
Especially close human relatives form a subfamily, the Homininae. A few researchers go so far as to include chimpanzees and bonobos and gorillas in the genus "Homo" along with humans. Alternatively, those fossil relatives more closely related to humans than the nearest living great ape species represent members of Hominidae without necessarily assigning subfamily or tribal categories.
Many extinct hominids have been studied to help understand the relationship between modern humans and the other extant hominids. Some of the extinct members of this family include "Gigantopithecus", "Orrorin", "Ardipithecus", "Kenyanthropus", and the australopithecines "Australopithecus" and "Paranthropus".
The exact criteria for membership in the tribe Hominini under the current understanding of human origins are not clear, but the taxon generally includes those species that share more than 97% of their DNA with the modern human genome, and exhibit a capacity for language or for simple cultures beyond the family or band. The theory of mind including such faculties as mental state attribution, empathy and even empathetic deception is a controversial criterion distinguishing the adult human alone among the hominids. Humans acquire this capacity at about four and a half years of age, whereas it has neither been proven nor disproven that gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos develop a theory of mind. This is also the case for some New World monkeys outside the family of great apes, as, for example, the capuchin monkeys.
However, without the ability to test whether early members of the Hominini (such as "Homo erectus", "Homo neanderthalensis", or even the australopithecines) had a theory of mind, it is difficult to ignore similarities seen in their living cousins. Orangutans have also been shown to have culture comparable to that of chimpanzees, and some say the orangutan may also satisfy these criteria. These scientific debates take on political significance for advocates of great ape personhood.
Classification.
Extant.
The seven living species of great ape are classified in four genera. The following classification is commonly accepted:
Fossil.
In addition to the extant species and subspecies above, archaeologists, paleontologists, and anthropologists have discovered numerous extinct great ape species. Below is based on the following taxonomy.
Family Hominidae
Physical description.
The great apes are large, tailless primates, with the smallest living species being the bonobo at 30–40 kilograms in weight, and the largest being the gorillas, with males weighing 140–180 kilograms. In all great apes, the males are, on average, larger and stronger than the females, although the degree of sexual dimorphism varies greatly among species. Although most living species are predominantly quadrupedal, they are all able to use their hands for gathering food or nesting materials, and, in some cases, for tool use.
Most species are omnivorous, but fruit is the preferred food among all but some human groups. Chimpanzees and orangutans primarily eat fruit. When gorillas run short of fruit at certain times of the year or in certain regions, they resort to eating shoots and leaves, often of bamboo, a type of grass. Gorillas have extreme adaptations for chewing and digesting such low-quality forage, but they still prefer fruit when it is available, often going miles out of their way to find especially preferred fruits. Humans, since the neolithic revolution, consume mostly cereals and other starchy foods, including increasingly highly processed foods, as well as many other domesticated plants (including fruits) and meat. Hominid teeth are similar to those of the Old World monkeys and gibbons, although they are especially large in gorillas. The dental formula is Human teeth and jaws are markedly smaller for their size than those of other apes, which may be an adaptation to eating cooked food for more than a million years.
Gestation in great apes lasts 8–9 months, and results in the birth of a single offspring, or, rarely, twins. The young are born helpless, and they must be cared for long periods of time. Compared with most other mammals, great apes have a remarkably long adolescence, not being weaned for several years, and not becoming fully mature for eight to thirteen years in most species (longer in humans). As a result, females typically give birth only once every few years. There is no distinct breeding season.
Gorillas and chimpanzees live in family groups of around five to ten individuals, although much larger groups are sometimes noted. Chimpanzees live in larger groups that break up into smaller groups when fruit becomes less available. When small groups of female chimpanzees go off in separate directions to forage for fruit, the dominant male(s) can no longer control them and the females often mate with other subordinate males, whether by choice or not. In contrast, groups of gorillas stay together regardless of the availability of fruit. When fruit is hard to find, they resort to eating leaves and shoots. Because gorilla groups stay together, the male is able to monopolize the females in his group. This fact is related to gorillas' greater sexual dimorphism than chimpanzees'. In both chimpanzees and gorillas, the groups include at least one dominant male, and females leave the group at maturity.
Legal status.
Due to the close genetic relationship between humans and other great apes, certain animal rights organizations, such as the Great Ape Project, argue that nonhuman great apes are persons and should be given basic human rights. Some countries have instituted a research ban to protect great apes from any kind of scientific testing.
On 25 June 2008, the Spanish parliament supported a new law that would make "keeping apes for circuses, television commercials or filming" illegal.
Conservation.
The following table lists the estimated number of great ape individuals living in the wild.

Wurzelpeter

Wurzelpeter is an assertive bitter hailing from Germany and also available as Wurzelpeter Orange, which is a potent apple flavoured liquor. Wurzelpeter is a herbal liqueur with all the flavour of the forest and is a product of Franz Wilhelm Langguth Erben, with its headquarters in Traben-Trarbach, a municipality in the district Bernkastel-Wittlich.
History.
In German folklore, "Wurzelpeter" was another word for gnome, a fact reflected by the sympathetic Wurzelpeter brand symbol. Gnomes were historically regarded as friendly magical beings that aspire to be helpful and carry out daily chores (such as making one's bed). They were known to live deep in the forest and were famed as healers.
This magical tradition is advertised as having been captured to this day by Wurzelpeter liquor. The age-old recipe and meticulous care in producing the drink ensure that the herbs and root-extracts used provide a unique wholehearted, aromatic forest flavour. 
The drink is made exclusively from natural forest ingredients, some with undisputed remedial properties and is said to relax the mind, body and soul. 
Documents referring to the confidential Wurzelpeter recipe go back as far as 1875, although it has been suggested that the Wurzelpeter recipe may well be much older. link title
Marketing.
Wurzelpeter is aggressively marketed by its logo gnome Wurzel, whose name comes from the German word for 'root'. Wurzel toys are available from the distributor; the most popular one features Wurzel (or Peter) with his foot on a soccer ball, not dissimilar to an old-fashioned forward like Rodney Marsh in his QPR heydey.
Wurzelpeter's chief outlet is Lidl, the discount supermarket, but is yet to find a reliable UK distributor.
The well known signature Wurzelpeter music now on the website has been remixed by a number of contemporary DJs, but is most known for its heavily sampling by Tricky during the 1990s Bristol trip-hop era.
Wurzelpeter is a notorious cult drink of choice for travelling British football supporters, who have attached to their favourite drink a series of affectionate songs.

Hague Adoption Convention

The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (or Hague Adoption Convention) is an international convention dealing with international adoption, child laundering, and child trafficking in an effort to protect those involved from the corruption, abuses and exploitation which sometimes accompanies international adoption. The Convention has been considered crucial because it provides a formal international and intergovernmental recognition of intercountry adoption to ensure that adoptions under the Convention will generally be recognized and given effect in other party countries.
Objectives.
The preamble to the Convention states:
The main objectives of the Convention, set out in Article 1, are:
History.
The Convention was developed by the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the preeminent organisation in the area of private international law. It was concluded on 29 May 1993 and entered into force on 1 May 1995. As of March 2013, the Convention has been ratified by 90 countries. Korea, Haiti, Nepal and the Russian Federation are signatories, but have not ratified it. Many countries which have not ratified the Convention do not permit foreign adoptions of their children nor adoptions of foreign children, for example Muslim countries.
With respect to the previous multilateral instruments which include some provisions regarding intercountry adotion, the Hague Adoption Convention is the major multilateral instrument regulating international adoption which calls for the need for coordination and direct cooperation between countries to ensure that appropriate safeguards are respected.
The Convention also requires that the all process should be authorized by central adoption authorities designated by the contracting states (chapter III of the Convention outlines the roles and responsibilities of this authority). If fully implemented at the national level, the Convention offers also a protective framework against the risks potentially implied in private adoption (when the adoptive parents set the terms of the adoption directly with the birth parents or with children's institutions plced in the country of origin, without recurring to accredited adoption service providers).
The Convention leaves to states discretion with regard to which public authority should be designated as central adoption authority (whose supervision and authorization is necessary to proceed with the adoption, Article 17) and which other bodies should be duly accredited as the provider of adoption services (Article 9). If fully implemented at the national level, the Convention offers also a protective framework against the risks potentially implied in private adoption (when the adoptive parents set the terms of the adoption directly with the birth parents, without recurring to accredited bodies).
"The Implementation and Operation of the 1993 Intercountry Adoption Convention: Guide to Good Practice", prepared by HCCH, provides assistance to the operation, use and interpretation of the Convention.
To comply with international standards, many changes have been introduced in national legislation enacting laws to criminalize the act of obtaining improper gains from intercountry adoptions. However, instances of trafficking in and sale of children for the purpose of adoption continue to take place in many parts of the world. (see Child laundering.) Especially during emergency situations, natural disasters or conflicts, it has been observed that children are adopted without strict legal procedures being followed, with a risk that there may be cases of child trafficking. It has also been noted that there was an excessive bureaucratization of the adoption process followed the implementation of the Hague Adoption Convention, possibly establishing additional barriers to the placement of children.

Arsenal submachine gun

The Arsenal M23 submachine gun () (also known as Arsenal Tallinn) was an Estonian submachine gun from 1926 through 1935. These submachine guns were designed and produced in the Estonian military equipment factory "Arsenal" in Karjamaa, Tallinn, but production was not more than 600 units. The weapon was chambered for the 9x20 mm semi-rimmed Browning cartridge to be compatible with ammunition for the Browning FN M1903 pistol which had been adopted by the Estonian Army. It operated on the blowback system and was essentially similar to the MP18.1; having a wooden stock, slotted barrel jacket, and horizontal left side magazine feed. A uniquely slender 40 round single column box magazine led to frequent cartridge feeding problems; and cooling fins which were machined lengthwise along the barrel to promote cooling air flow when firing (similar to the Lewis machine gun), unnecessarily complicated production. It was used by the combat support units of the Border Guard, the Estonian Defence League and the Estonian Defence Forces. The Arsenal submachine gun was replaced in Estonian service by the Finnish Suomi KP/-31 submachinegun in 1938. The Estonian Army sold a few samples to Latvia and all of the remainder found their way to Republican forces during the Civil War in Spain.

Glastonbury Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club based in Glastonbury, Somerset. The club's first team plays in the West of England Premier League which is an accredited ECB Premier League, the highest level for recreational club cricket in England and Wales.
History.
The first record of a cricket club representing Glastonbury is from 1893, when they played host to Weston-super-Mare at the Morlands Athletic Ground, Glastonbury. The home side won by seven wickets with a match-winning performance by 'R Laver', who claimed six Weston-super-Mare wickets, and then top-scored for Glastonbury in their reply with 54. Laver continued to star for Glastonbury in the three recorded matches from 1894, taking seven wickets against Wells, six against Yeovil, and five against Bridgwater. He claimed five wickets again in 1899, their next recorded match, against Wincanton.
In 1986, the Morlands Athletic Ground was renamed the Tor Leisure Ground. Glastonbury played in the Somerset League from at least 1990 until 2002, when they were divisional champions, earning promotion to the Bristol & Somerset Division. They won this division at the first attempt in 2003. Despite finishing with fewer points than Midsomer Norton, they had a higher average number of points due to having one more match cancelled. Playing in Premier Two in 2004, Glastonbury finished top of their league for the third successive season, gaining promotion to the West of England Premier League Premier One division.

Plot.
While playing baseball near the home of wealthy hypochondriac Mr. Morton, the gang inadvertently breaks one of Morton's windows. This mishap coincides with a plan hatched by Morton's wife to get her husband's mind off his imaginary illnesses by adopting some children.
Hoping to prove that he would be an unsuitable parent, Morton pretends that he is crazy, the better to scare away the gang and to dissuade Mrs. Morton from her adoption scheme. Instead, the kids prove to Morton that he does not need all his pills and poultices, thereby giving the old man a new lease on life and a better appreciation of children.

Automation for real-time case tracking eliminates gaps in the service delivery process and reduces redundancy and fragmentation of services. PROMIS provides support for all client-service functions of an agency from "outreach to outcome." Through the use of Internet technologies and a development approach built on business process re-engineering and extensive user involvement, the PROMIS system improves client service by reducing paperwork, automating policies and procedures and integrating the delivery system within Head Start agencies.
The PROMIS project effort was funded by the Offices of Head Start, ACF from 2001 through 2003. Although the first beta version became available for Head Start agencies to use free of charge back in 1999, the first production release was not available until the summer of 2004. Since its first release, PROMIS' user base has been increasing by about 100 new organizations a year. 
A large majority of the so called mega agencies (serving 10,000 families or more) have been using the PROMIS system for their daily operation.

Joseph "Joe" David Kinnear (12 February 1912 – 14 December 1981) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1930s.
Kinnear, who was used by Melbourne mostly as a half back, came to the club from Brunswick in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). He spent six seasons at Melbourne and played his last game in their losing Preliminary Final side of 1937. Kinnear later worked at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as its scoreboard manager.
A talented sportsman, Kinnear played two first-class cricket matches against Tasmania in late December 1931. His debut, at Hobart, began on Christmas Day and he bowled 12 wicket-less overs and scored 13 in his only innings for the match. Soon after, Kinnear took the field for Victoria again, this time in Launceston. He dismissed Australian Test cricketer and South Melbourne footballer Laurie Nash with his right-arm fast bowling, the only wicket of his career. The fielder who took the catch, Bryan Cosgrave, was another VFL player.
His son Colin coached the Sydney Swans from 1989 to 1990. Joe Kinnear also had a brother William who was involved in sport, having played a first-class match for Victoria and three VFL games with Essendon.

Ana Mihajlovski

Ana Mihajlovski (Cyrillic: Ана Михајловски; born October 20, 1982, in Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia) is a Serbian television presenter mostly hosting locally licensed reality programmes through Emotion Production. She also occasionally works as an actress.
Career.
Mihajlovski first appeared on television during 2001 while she was still in high school. She appeared on a talk/pop-culture programme called "Loudspeaker" on YU Info channel.
Her career breakthrough occurred on a show called "Leteći start" (Flying start ), created and produced by Emotion that started airing on RTV Pink in early February 2003. Just 20 years of age at the time, she co-hosted with Milan Kalinić and the two quickly became a very popular team.
Mihajlovski soon started appearing on other Emotion reality productions like "48 sati svadba" that began airing in mid June 2004. The newfound popularity led to more jobs like hosting the 2004 Sunčane Skale music festival alongside Kalinić in Herceg Novi in July 2004. In late November 2004, Mihajlovski started appearing on "Jednostavan život", another Emotion production, which was the Serbian version of "The Simple Life" where she and Marijana Mićić played bratty city girls trying to survive in rural surroundings. Airing on RTS, Serbian public broadcaster, the show gained decent popularity and after the first season ended sometime during spring 2005, more episodes were ordered. The second season started airing in early 2006, ending in mid May.
Other than "Jednostavan život", Mihajlovski did not work a lot throughout 2005 and 2006, because of finishing her university studies and getting pregnant.
She returned to television from maternity leave in May 2007 to host the inaugural season of Serbian "Celebrity Big Brother" called "Veliki brat VIP".
From late September 2008 until early January 2009, she was part of the team hosting "Operacija trijumf" gala evenings each Monday. Local version of "Star Academy" that included contestant from five Balkan countries, simultaneously aired on 6 networks throughout the region and expanded her presence outside of Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where she was already well known. Additionally, during the show, she got dragged into minor controversy when freshly voted-out contestant Jasmina Midžić in a fit of anger accused Mihajlovski of supposedly being part of the conspiracy to have contestant Danijel Pavlović (Midižić's direct opponent for elimination that night) remain on the show.
In February and March 2009, Mihajlovski hosted studio pieces for the "Veliki brat VIP All Stars".She was the main television show presenter that aired on TV PRVA called Ana and Rakonjac.In 2014,she was working as presenter at Serbian version of television music show X Factor.
Private life.
Sometime in late 2004, she started dating businessman Goran Stamenković, the majority owner of Emotion Production and also her boss at the time. In May 2006, they announced their engagement and her five month pregnancy. Their daughter, Iva, was born in October 2006, however Goran and Ana never actually got married.
In July 2008, they ended their relationship and she moved out with their daughter. They remain on good terms, as she still works in the company he owns.

Howardsville, Albemarle County, Virginia

Howardsville is an unincorporated community in Albemarle County, Virginia.
Howardsville is named after one of its principal founders, Allen Howard, who settled the northern bank of the James River at the point where the Rockfish River, its largest tributary, enters its flow. Along with other families, such as the Andersons, Jordans, Cabells and Childresses, both sides of the river were settled by people moving up from the lower James to plant new lands with tobacco and other crops in the 1730s and 1740s. The area was also known for its limestone and iron ore deposits and a forge of some sort was established in the settlement from a very early date.
There is a stream that flows through the community called the Mullinax, which is probably an Indian word and may denote the name of an Indian village on this site that predated European settlement. Dozens of arrowheads, spearheads, stone bowls and other Indian artifacts have been found in the area. Probably the first contact Europeans had with the area were fur traders making their way up river from Indian village to village.
The original community consisted of several large and medium plantations, as well as a landing for batteaux poling up and down the river. More settlers rapidly settled up the Rockfish River and along both sides of the James. In the mid-1700s, a road was cut along the north bank of the James - the James River Road - and another wound up the Rockfish to meet Secretary Sands' Road, which cut through the southern part of Albemarle County.
The settlement, probably called Howard’s Landing at the time, was created prior to the founding of Albemarle County so, along with Scottsville, a little further down river, is one of the founding communities of the county. It remains unique for being almost unchanged since the mid-1700s and early 1800s, with its two original historic plantation homes, one of the earliest Masonic Lodges in the state and also one of its earliest Methodist halls. The old tobacco prizery is still there, although its upper stories were burned down by Sheridan during the Civil War. The old Howardsville Bank is also there, which printed its own bank notes and was a Civil War hospital and general store for much of its history. Both buildings date from the middle 1700s.
The small 19th century post office building has been preserved and the school, dating from the early 20th century, is now a well preserved private residence. Other notable buildings include Social Hall, once owned by relatives of Colonel Moseby, who practiced law there for a few years and met his wife, who was part of the Howardsville community at the time.
During the 1760s, the landing became the site of a store established by the Scottish tobacco barons of Glasgow, who set up these trading posts all along the rivers of Virginia. The store sold goods to the planters in exchange for their tobacco crops and there was a large, secure warehouse built to house its valuable goods. Batteaux would work up and down the river bringing everything from iron pots to fine fabrics that the planters’ homes turned into dresses, bedcovers and curtains. They also brought more settlers, along with their indentured servants and slaves.
The planters, anxious to acquire more land and to display the signs of their new wealth as rapidly as possibly, soon fell into large debt with the store, which was run for most of its history by a young Scotsman called Charles Irving. Irving married one of the local Jordan girls, built a large house and ended up buying extensive tracts of land in the area, often in lieu of debts. Irving was literate and well-educated and his signature witnessed many of the deeds of the late 1700s, both for land transactions, wills and other legal settlements. Descendents of his still live on old family land on the south bank of the river.
During the American Revolution, the village was known as Irving's Store. Because of its large, secure brick warehouse, its foundry, and other secure brick buildings, as well as its central location on the James River, with roads heading both east-west and north-south, it became one of the storage depots for the Virginia Militia and several letters of the time from the major in command at Irving's Store talk of difficulties in supplying the militia with armaments because of the low level of the river and lack of boats to transport goods. The foundry would have been useful to make bayonets and repair muskets and other military equipment. It is also mentioned that British cavalry under Colonel Tarleton tried to make a raid up the river from Richmond to destroy the arms depot.
During the early years of the 19th century, the community grew into a small town. It was on a prime location at the confluence of two rivers. Soapstone had been found just up the Rockfish River and was now being mined and the local planters were growing rich on tobacco. So, when the James River and Kanawha Canal was built through the town in the 1830s, the land around the canal was divided into lots and sold off, stores were built, two mills were erected, and there was a canal boat basin - probably for minor repairs and to store boats that were not using the canal. There was a lock and an aqueduct erected over the Rockfish, and a lock-keeper's cottage was built. It is from this period that the name 'Howardsville' was first used.
Within ten years of the canal coming to the town, local investors set up the Howardsville and Rockfish Gap Turnpike Company and during the 1840s cut a road from the river over the Blue Ridge Mountains and across the Shenandoah Valley south of Staunton all the way to the Appalachians. But the turnpike was never successful. Heavy rains washed out the road surface and the company found it hard to collect tolls, so the state soon rescinded its license to charge users and within a few years the scheme was abandoned. But the route of the old turnpike was used for many years and is still used today, in many parts.
The 1840s and 1850s were a thriving time for the community. There was the canal, the turnpike, the foundry and mills, as well as a tobacco grading and prizing station that handled up to 500 hogsheads of tobacco a year - a huge amount. Boat captains settled in the town, a bank was set up - one of the most solvent and successful in the state of Virginia at the time. There was also a James River Insurance Company that insured packet boats, homes, barns, and slaves - and there is extant a list of all the rates to insure slaves of different ages from a range of various disabilities.
Monticola, owned by Daniel Hartsook, cashier of the bank, owner of the insurance company, and chief investor in the turnpike company, was built at this time, and West Cote, the other stately home of the community, was also built then, replacing an earlier dwelling on the site. There were at least two hotels, a livery stable, and several stores.
During the Civil War, the foundry is known to have made sabers for the Confederate cavalry and a captain of cavalry was sent to the town to supervise their production. The town also supplied Lee’s forces with food and the canal ran military supplies to his forces continuously during the war years, especially supplying Lee's army in Richmond during the last year of the war.
Because of its industry and location on the canal, Union cavalry under Sheridan, which including a column led by George Custer, raided the Howardsville-Scottsville area in the spring of 1864, burning bridges, the foundry, the mills and several the houses. It burned and smashed the lock gates and aqueduct, destroyed canal boats carrying food and military supplies, raided the bank - though its gold had been secreted away just hours before the Union troops arrived – and Sheridan set up house in Monticola while his men pillaged the surrounding area.
The invaders remained in the area for two-three days, raiding up and down the north bank of the James, unable to cross because the river was in spate and locals had destroyed all the bridges that crossed it. Triumphant, they eventually headed east down the river, to then turn northeast and circle Richmond to rejoin Grant's army.
After the Civil War, the bank was no more. The turnpike was in a state of dilapidation. The canal was replaced by the C&O railway line, which built a station there, and the community struggled to regain its former glory. It remained a small center that served the local farmers with goods and shipped their produce to market. There was a train depot and several stores, a doctor and a post office, a school and a small library. There was also a mercantile business, a saw mill, and the foundry was still in production, where it made ploughshares and other peacetime implements, as well as blacksmiths, a lawyer or two, a hotel, all of which served the local farming community. Although a road bridge was built over the James River about 1911 to replace the old ferry, the community continued to decline. The foundry soon closed, the mercantile business struggled, the hotels had little business and the stores began to look a dowdy and rundown.
The station and the stately home of Monticola, which is close by, featured in the 1941 movie "Virginia" that starred Fred MacMurray and Madeleine Carroll, with one scene taking place at the train depot and numerous scenes being shot at the old home on the hill. The filmmakers liked the slightly quaint and old-fashioned, but preserved, quality of the area.
Howardsville’s population did not grow significantly during this time, and with the general urbanization of the 1950s, the community fell into decline. When Hurricane Camille hurtled down the Rockfish River in 1969 and swept away all the lower town that rested along the James River, many of the stores and the hotels were already in ruin or decline. The hurricane, which rose the James River by over 30 feet and inundated all the homes in the lower town, merely finished the job. It swept away part of the road bridge over the James, completely took out the road and rail bridges over the Rockfish, and left a deluge of mud and torn up trees across the entire river floodplain.
Today, the village community is about 25 persons strong, but there is a wider area that associates with Howardsville and partakes in its social activities. The oldest, most historic homes, which were sheltered from hurricanes Camille and Agnes, remain, lovingly restored by their present owners. The current village is on the Virginia Birding Route and the Virginia Cycle Route. There is a bed and breakfast establishment and local farmers produce goat cheese, bread and other crops, though forestry is the main agricultural produce of the area. Soapstone is still quarried in nearby Schyler. It has its own boat ramp, where kayakers, canoers and fishermen can embark and land. As such, it remains one of the quaintest, most unspoilt villages of central Virginia.
Monticola and West Cote are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="19774052" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774052" title="Indigenism">
Indigenism

Indigenism is "(like indigeneity) is a term without a standard meaning" according to an article in the "Globalization & Autonomy Glossary" on the Globalization and Autonomy Online Compendium website published by the University of British Columbia Press. Indigenism can refer to several different ideologies associated with indigenous peoples, is used differently by a various scholars and activists, and can be purely descriptively or carry political connotations.
Who is indigenous?
The question of who is indigenous may be less than straightforward, depending on the region under consideration. Thus, for the New World, in the Americas as well as in Australia, the question is rather straightforward, while it is less easy to answer in the case of South Africa.
As international human rights movement.
Anthropologist Ronald Niezen uses the term to describe "the international movement that aspires to promote and protect the rights of the world's 'first peoples'."
Variation.
New Zealander scholar Jeffrey Sissons has criticized what he calls "eco-indigenism" on the part of international forums such as the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples, which he claims enforces a link between indigenous peoples and traditional economies, and also confuses the issues faced by New World indigenous, who are mostly urban dwellers and live in states dominated by people descendant from their colonizers, and by ethnic minorities in Asia and Africa who are more likely to live "close to the land" and live in states where the colonizers have long since left (though they may still face persecution from the post-colonial successor state).
As pan-indigenous political or cultural solidarity.
As used by Cherokee-American scholar Ward Churchill (b. 1947; author of "From a Native Son") and Mexican scholar Guillermo Bonfil Batalla (1935-1991), the term refers to the common civilization of which, they argue, all New World indigenous peoples are a part, and to their common "spirit of resistance" to settler colonialism.
As official policy in Latin American nation-states.
In Latin America the term "Indigenismo" is often used "to describe the ways that colonial nation-states have
formulated their vision of Indigenous social inclusion."
Variation.
One scholar, Alcida Rita Ramos, uses the term not only to refer to official policy, but to all social and political interactions between the state or mainstream society and indigenous peoples, whether initiated by the indigenous or by other parties.
As approach to scholarship.
Eva Marie Garroutte uses "Radical Indigenism" to mean an attitude towards scholarship on indigenous peoples that does not treat their culture as a curiosity, or of interest solely in order to study the individuals who practise the culture; instead she argues that indigenous people possess entire philosophies of knowledge capable of generating new knowledge through different models of inquiry from those used in Western philosophy. She presents it as a logical next step to post-colonial theories which seek to question Western "ways of knowing" but have not yet proposed alternatives.
As ethnic nationalism.
Indigenism, Native nationalism, or Indigenous nationalism is a kind of ethnic nationalism emphasizing the group's indigeneity to their homeland. This may be embraced by post-colonial anarchism as well as in neo-völkisch or national mysticist nationalism building on historical or pseudohistorical claims of ethnic continuity.
While New World movements usually go by the name "indigenism" (notably in South America and in Mexico, "indigenismo" is a political force), the term autochthonism is encountered for Eastern European and Central Asian nationalisms.
"Autochthonism" is an issue especially in those parts of Europe formerly under Ottoman control, i.e. the Balkans and Romania (see rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire). Originating in the 19th century, autochthonist nationalism affected the area throughout the 20th century.
Writing in 1937, Nichifor Crainic celebrated "Gândirea"'s role in making nationalism and Orthodoxy priorities in Romania's intellectual and political life:
Variations.
Indigenism involves the suppression of certain aspects of history and the emphasis of others (to which there may be no direct continuity), as well as the selection of one of multiple sources of ancestry for a "people". It can be personal, as in W. E. B. Du Bois's black nationalism, despite his Dutch ancestry. It is also relative, since while nativists in the United States argue that Hispanic and Latino American people are more indigenous to the United States land than European Americans, counterclaims posit European Americans as more indigenous than the so-called Native Americans.
The portrayal of the Christian wars against Al-Andalus as a "Reconquista", or "reconquest" is an indigenist nationalist trope that evokes Iberia's pre-Muslim past. The Hutu Power ideology posited that the Hutu were the first, and therefore the legitimate, inhabitants of Rwanda, justifying the extermination of the Tutsi. The Arab–Israeli conflict involves competing claims to indigenity, with modern disputants to territory claiming a direct line of descent to its ancient inhabitant peoples - some of them mythical - such as the Philistines and the Canaanites.

<doc id="19774059" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774059" title="Parnall G.4/31">
Parnall G.4/31

The Parnall G.4/31 was a 1930s design from the George Parnall and Company to meet Air Ministry Specification G.4/31 for a "general purpose" aircraft.
Design and development.
The Parnall G.4/31 design would be as a replacement for the Westland Wapiti and Fairey Gordon. As such it needed to be usable as a day and night bomber as well as the reconnaissance, torpedo and dive-bombing roles. Designs were offered by Handley Page, Vickers, Fairey and Armstrong Whitworth as well as Parnall.
The G.4/31 was a large angular biplane with fixed spatted wheel spats powered by a 690 hp (515 kW) Bristol Pegasus IM3 with a Townend ring. There was a single forward-firing machine gun for the pilot and a Scarff ring mounted Lewis gun for the observer. Underwing bomb racks on the lower wings and provision to carry a torpedo between the main undercarriage units was also envisioned.
After the prototype was rolled out in 1935, a number of changes were made to the airframe and tail surfaces, when results from wind tunnel testing by the Royal Aeronautical Establishment (R.A.E.) with models revealed problems in spinning. Modifications to the fin, rudder, elevators and rear fuselage were necessary. 
Testing.
First flying at the Parnall factory in Yate, Bristol, in 1935 with Captain Howard John Saint at the controls, it was not delivered for evaluation by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) at Martlesham Heath until early 1936. The biplane Vickers Type 253 had already been selected to meet the specification and then cancelled when the Ministry saw that Vickers monoplane alternative to the Type 253 was superior and that entered service as the Vickers Wellesley.
The sole Parnall G.4/31 (serial "K2772") prototype was used for armament trials by the A&AED until March 1937 when it was damaged in a crash and subsequently scrapped. The G.4/31 was the final military design from the company.

Nada Herman-Witkamp

Nada Herman (born 1965) is an Australian artist. Her oil paintings are exuberant with bright colours and bold thick strokes which produce tactile, lively canvasses. She usually depicts beaches, harbour and marine scenes, floral still life and nudes. 
Nada Herman was born into an artistic family. Her grandfather was the late Sali Herman, who was famous for his depiction of Terrace Houses and the Sydney slum houses. Nada's father was also a well-known artist, Ted Herman, who tutored and inspired Nada from eight years old. She won her first art prize at ten years old.
All through Nada's youth, she was taught and observed by her two older teachers. At one stage, all three of them worked together in her bushland studio which overlooks Pittwater in Sydney Australia - a beautiful place to paint from.
In 1987, Herman finished a certificate in visual art, receiving honours in painting. In 1990 Nada graduated from a bachelor in visual arts.
In 1992, an exhibition titled "Three Generations" was held and it was Herman's first chance to show her work. It was to be the final exhibition for her grandfather as he died a year later at 95. The "Three Generations" show was a great success and from then on Herman's style began to grow and develop with more and more confidence and expression using loads of oil paint and vibrant colours.
Herman has had many solo and joint exhibitions throughout the past 22 years. Her paintings are now in great demand from art collectors and galleries throughout Sydney as well as worldwide.
Thick brushes are a necessity in Nada's style as well tins of oil paints and a palette knife. The palette knife creates a fresh painterly quality and is perfect for painting wet over wet without the colours becoming muddy.
The colour and excitement in Nada's work reveals her love of the area in which she lives and the beauty found within the bush, marine life and beaches. Still lifes fascinate her with their stagnant yet energetic appearance. A humble flower can create so much joy and power in Nada's eyes as can an apple in a bowl of fruit.
Beaches are full of subject matter with their lovely bathers and the ever moving waves, seagulls and sailboats. Everyday is different and Nada adores painting beach scenes. Her lifelong passion for painting has developed into an expressive, flamboyant style full of texture, colour and depth.
Many local and overseas clients enthuse about her wonderful colourful paintings, which bring joy and colour into their homes. Nada exhibits annually from her parents unique home / studio in Clareville NSW Australia. The property called "Hy-brasil" has a historical 1930's sandstone house, nearly 3 acres of panoramic views, natural bushland and beautiful fish ponds, gardens and interesting subject matter for an artist. Internationally Nadas work is on exhibition at Agora Gallery New York and Vivid Arts Network Italy. Her paintings are increasingly sought after and are in private collections in Asia, the USA, Europe and Australasia. Nada has been a runner up in the Mosman Art Prize a number of times.
Nada Herman exhibits regularly, her most recent solo exhibition in May and June 2008 in Sydney. Her paintings are also constantly exhibited at a number of well known Sydney galleries and more widely throughout Australia. Many of these galleries cite Nada Herman as one of their most in-demand artists.
Family.
Nada Herman's grandfather is Sali Herman (OBE) and her father, Ted Herman, was also a well-known artist. She exhibited with both in 1992 in an exhibition titled 'Three Generations'

Jacob G. Frick

Jacob Gilbert Frick (January 23, 1825 – March 5, 1902) was an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his gallantry in action while serving as the colonel of the 129th Pennsylvania Infantry at the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.
Early military career.
Frick was born in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, a fourth-generation descendant of Swiss immigrants. In June 1846, following the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, he was commissioned a Third Lieutenant in the 3rd Ohio Infantry Regiment. When the war ended, he received a regular army commission in the 11th US Infantry Regiment. He served as an instructor at Fort McHenry, and was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention.
Civil War service.
Eighteen soldiers were awarded Medals of Honor for their heroism during the heavy fighting at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on December 13, 1862. In action against the Confederate forces, Colonel Jacob Frick seized the colors and led his command through a terrible fire of enemy cannon and musketry. On May 3, 1863, at Chancellorsville, Virginia, Colonel Frick recovered the colors of his regiment in a hand-to-hand engagement, after the flag had been taken by Confederate forces.
Frick later led the 27th Pennsylvania Emergency Militia during the Gettysburg Campaign. His men successfully burned the Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge to prevent its capture by Confederate infantry under Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon. Later, he consulted with Col. Henry Pleasants regarding digging a mine under Confederate entrenchments during the 1864 Siege of Petersburg that resulted in the Battle of the Crater. After the war, Frick returned to Pottsville, Pennsylvania.
He died in Pottsville in 1902 and is buried in the Presbyterian Cemetery.

Cambriol

Cambriol or New Cambriol was the name given to one of North America's early English colonies established by Sir William Vaughan (1575–1641). The area Vaughan had purchased from the Company of Adventurers to Newfoundland in 1616 was all that land on the Avalon Peninsula located south of a line drawn from Caplin Bay (now Calvert) to Placentia Bay (near present day Gooseberry Cove). Vaughan had called the area New Cambriol — "a little Wales" in the New World. In his book "The Golden Fleece", an allegory in praise of his colony, makes the following assertion concerning Cambriol:
History.
Sir William Vaughan, a poet and colonizer, was deeply concerned with the prevailing economic conditions of Wales in the early 17th century and became interested in establishing a colony in Newfoundland. In 1617–1618 he had obtained the services of Richard Whitbourne and sent out settlers to his new colony, at his own expense, to establish roots there. His naming of the area as Cambriol, was a gesture of good will for his native country Wales where he envisaged a new country for his fellow countrymen ""reserved by God for us Britons"" and as eloquently portrayed in the verse by fellow colonizer John Guy:
Vaughan had sent a number of settlers in 1617 with every good intention of making the maiden voyage himself and settling in his new colony with them. Because of ill health, Vaughan was not able to do so. Then in 1618 he requested Sir Richard Whitbourne to take on the task of colonizing Cambriol and in return offered him governorship, which he accepted. Two vessels were charter by Whitbourne to make the voyage. One of the vessels, which carried a crew of fisherman for the colony, was waylaid by pirates and was never regained. This was the first of many setbacks to the longevity of the colony. As evidence in Whitbourne's letter back to Vaughan in 1618 where he informs us:
Upon arrival at Cambriol, Whitbourne was not pleased with the progress of the original settlers and sent all but six back to Wales citing a complete lack of pioneering initiative and thorough laziness. Withbourne was harsh and vitriolic in his description of the work the settlers had done in the year since they first arrived as can be seen in his correspondence to Vaughan:
With the loss of population, Vaughan was obligated to hand over the northern part of his colony (Fermeuse area) to Lord Falkland and to Lord Baltimore the area around Ferryland.
Vaughan at New Cambriol.
Vaughan did eventually arrive at his colony in 1622 and during his three or four years stay wrote "The Golden Fleece" in an effort to stimulate the colonists into hard work. He returned to Britain to arrange publication of his work and returned to New Cambriol in 1628. The colony suffered terribly over the next few years due to harsh weather conditions and the constant destruction of property at the hands of the French and other Grand Bank fishermen.
Vaughan had returned to his native Wales in 1630 to settle his financial affairs and at the same time to convince his brother-in-law Sir Henry Salusbury of Denbigh and other ""gentlemen of Wales"" to join him in his colony at New Cambriol. Vaughan had offered grants of land but no one took him up on the offer.
Dissolution of colony.
No other information is available to determine if Vaughan had returned to his colony New Cambriol after 1630, but his efforts to entice further colonization did not cease. In 1630 he published a medical handbook entitled Newlander's Cure, whereby it contained advice for colonists on the preservation of health.
All efforts to increase colonization had failed and sometime between 1630 and 1637 the colony was abandoned. At that time Vaughan was nearly sixty years old and he had given up any further attempts of colonization. In 1637 the Privy Council was informed of its failure and the failure of other colonies in Newfoundland.
Then in 1637 Sir David Kirke and his partners were given a royal charter giving them possession of Newfoundland with Kirke as Proprietary Governor. This charter superseded all other earlier charters granted to the earlier colonizers of the Avalon Peninsula, as they were deemed to have been abandoned.

Invasion gene associated RNA (InvR)

Invasion gene associated RNA (also known as InvR) is a small non-coding RNA involved in regulating one of the major outer cell membrane porin proteins in "Salmonella" species.
InvR was originally predicted by computational screening the genome of "Salmonella typhimurium" for novel sRNA genes. In this screen 46 candidate sRNA genes not conserved in "Escherichia coli" were identified.
The "Salmonella" the virulence factors that facilitate invasion of the host intestinal epithlium are located in a ~ 40 kb region in the "Salmonella" genome referred to as Salmonella pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1). The gene encoding InvR is located in this SPI-1 region between two genes called "invH" and STM2901. InvR appears to be unique to "Salmonella" species as there does not appear to be any predicted homologues in other Enterobacteriaceae species.
InvR is ~80nt long and appears to be independently expressed from its own promoter. Its expression is activated by the transcription factor HilD and has been shown to be abundantly expressed during exponential growth. InvR has been shown to bind the RNA chaperone Hfq in vitro and Hfq is required for in vivo stability. In "S. typhimurium" InvR RNA has been shown to repress the synthesis of the abundant outer membrane porin protein OmpD. Despite being located in the SPI-1 region there has been no link identified between the function of InvR and the SPI-1 dependent secretion pathway or invasion.

Licola, Italy

Licola is an area in the province of Naples which takes its name from Lago dei Follicoli, a lake which formerly occupied most of the area. The current population of Licola ranges between 4,000 and 5,000. Licola is a strip of land facing the sea, and is roughly three kilometers by ten kilometers in size. It begins at the foot of Mount Cuma and ends in Marina di Varcaturo.
The Licola area is divided between two municipalities. In particular, the southern part is divided between the villages Licola Center (also known as Licola Village) and Licola Lido (also known as Lido di Licola) of the municipality (or "comune") of Pozzuoli, bordering the Arco Felice section of the municipality. The northern part, Licola Mare, is part of the hamlet of Varcaturo, which is a section of the municipality of Giugliano, part of the constituency of Licola-Lago Patria. The town revolves around Piazza San Massimo, which is the oldest square in the town.
Geography.
Licola is located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered to the north by Varcaturo and Lago Patria, hamlets within Giugliano, to the east by Monterusciello and Monte Grillo, and to the south by the town of Bacoli, while to the west lies the Tyrrhenian Sea. The morphological and geological aspects of Licola are substantially the same as those of Cuma which it borders. The coast has an unusually straight contour in its north-south extension due to the erosion of the walls of tuff spread all throughout zone.
The dunes of Licola can be separated into two distinct zones: a first, outer layer subject to marine erosion, and a second strip that is stabilized by vegetation. Local vegetation consists of halophilic plants on the coast, while the interior is characterized by Mediterranean scrub. There is increasing interest in these natural habitats, as it is believed that some of the local flora are native only to this area.
Further inland, the environment supports a system of dense vegetation, made up of oak forest on a dry, sandy soil, which was repeatedly cited by Roman authors for the pleasant atmosphere it produces. There was once a lake (Lake Licola) in this interior region, before the land was reclaimed. The reclaimed land is now used for agriculture, typically vineyards and orchards, due to the high fertility of the soil.
Climate.
Licola is subject to the typical Mediterranean climate with hot summers, dry winters, and temperate rainy periods in autumn and spring. Over 75% of the days in an average year are sunny, and its climatic classification refers to the town of Pozzuoli as class "C".
The Professional Institute of State for Agriculture and the Environment (IPAA) has established an advanced station for weather data collection that monitors the climate of Licola with extreme precision. The accompanying table shows the figures for 2006:
Territory.
The territory of Licola preserves not only an invaluable archaeological heritage but also popular and religious traditions and a significant commercial, cultural and tourist function.
According to the latest archaeological findings, which emerged during excavations carried out by the Archeological Heritage Authority, it is thought that the territory of Licola covers an old Roman road, the Domitian Way, and the remains of an amphitheater of the same period whose precise location has yet to be discovered.
The important archeological site of the town of Liternum (containing the tomb of Scipio Africanus) is located
about one kilometer north of Licola, in Lago Patria (where a lake of the same name is located which has the unusual characteristic of being heart-shaped). It was there that Scipio chose to remain in voluntary exile from Rome and where he founded a Roman colony along with his most trusted legionaries and their families.
To the south, Cumae preserves an invaluable acropolis as well as the Cave of the Sibyl, famous for the prophesies uttered there by the Cumaean Sibyl, while slightly further south lies the magnificent Arco Felice Vecchio.
Licola now contains the Regional Park of the Phlegraean Fields (Campi Flegrei), which preserves the dunes and habitat specific to the area and has been declared a Site of Importance to the Community and a Special Protection Zone owing to the rarity of the species living there, such as the sea daffodil.
Along with the remains of the Cumaean Acropolis, the Regional Park of the Phlegraen Fields also contains an area of rare Mediterranean evergreen forest, known to the ancients as the Silva Gallinaria.
Numerous species of both migrating and non-migrating birds—many endangered—take refuge in the marshes and green areas of Licola. Most notably, the heron has returned to the area, while on the beaches there have been sightings of loggerhead sea turtles.
The seabed along the Licola-Cumae beach, between the island of Ischia and Ventotene, contains a submarine canyon, the Canyon of Cumae, which provides a home for cetaceans such as dolphins and rorqual whales.
History.
The town of Licola, together with the neighboring towns of Lago Patria and Varcaturo, comprise the territory formerly inhabited by the Osci in the 5th to 4th century BC. The Osci founded many cities in Campania, including Liternum, the remains of which are located just north of Licola. This town experienced a remarkable development, especially during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.
The first reference to Liternum dates from Roman times: the historian Livy wrote that in 194 BC thirty Roman families set up a colony there. Later many additional colonies were added and in the 2nd century Liternum was already among the most prosperous prefectures of the "fertile countryside" of Campania (Latin: "Campania felix"). The archaeological remains of the forum, temple, church and theater of Liternum are preserved from this period.
Liternum was also one of the four oldest cities in Campania in which Christianity was introduced and widely practiced, in the 1st and 2nd century AD.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the ONC (Opera Nazionale Combattenti, ‘National Soldiers Works’, a welfare agency formed by the fascist regime) directed a large agricultural business in Licola. With the start of World War II, this business ceased activity and was subsequently dismantled.
In the 1960s and 1970s Licola emerged as a significant tourist attraction. After the Irpinia earthquake in 1980 and the bradyseism of 1982, however, many displaced people sought shelter in Licola and its tourist industry went into a period of decline. A strong revival in tourism occurred subsequently in the 1990s.
Numerous quarries for the extraction of sand were opened in the 1970s and 1980s. These have now all been closed owing to environmental and archeological regulations imposed by the Cultural and Environment Heritage Ministry and the Archeological Heritage Ministry.
Economy.
The economy of licolense is based substantially on primary and tertiary sector. Are highly developed cultures of orchards and vineyards, which thanks to the fertility of the soil provide discrete quantities of high quality. Note that this area is home to the falanghina vineyards Campi Flegrei and pedirosso Campi Flegrei.
The services sector is facing, almost in its entirety, tourism, showing a remarkable development of seaside resorts and hotel facilities, with the number of campsites and hotels of about 2,500 beds.
In addition, the area is home to many tourist attractions, restaurants, swimming pools, water parks, discos and privileged destination of a considerable flow of people from the entire provinces of Naples and Caserta, both during the summer that spring.
Transports.
The scope of urban transport relies Cumana to rail and road transport. The first is a suburban railway linking the coast of Licola - Cuma with the center of Naples and is considered the first underground railway to be built in Italy, which also connects to rail Circumflegrea. The rail system, together with a bus system is run by SEPSA.
Another company that manages the urban transport by bus is the CTP.

<doc id="19774142" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774142" title="XBRL assurance">
XBRL assurance

XBRL assurance is the auditor's opinion on whether a financial statement or other business report published in XBRL, is relevant, accurate, complete, and fairly presented. An XBRL report is an electronic file and called instance in XBRL terminology. 
IFAC and other accounting organizations are discussing the topic to decide on a common approach and XBRL auditing standards. The auditor may give assurance to an XBRL financial statement, an XBRL business report and XBRL real-time reporting (often referred to as continuous reporting). The short term focus is on XBRL financial statements and regulatory reports, while the future focus is expected to be more on real-time reporting.
Digital reporting process.
An XBRL report is part of a digital reporting supply chain. The auditor should not focus only on the reliability of the report itself. It is better to focus on the whole supply chain including the communication over a network of the report. The auditor needs to check if the report that has been sent (and received) is complete and in time.
In assessing the XBRL reporting process the auditor can use a reference model in which the layering of the whole digital reporting supply chain is reflected. The auditor performs an audit on every layer of the digital reporting supply chain, with assistance of experts and use of software tools on specific areas. 
A known example of a reference model is the OSI model. The use of a more comprehensive and detailed reference model by the auditor seems logical.
Model.
XBRL assurance is a container concept which covers multiple types of XBRL reports, audits, audit reports and related topics. In order for the auditor to be able to give the assurance, several aspects need to be clear: 
With XBRL assurance the auditor needs to distinguish between primary and secondary audit objects:
The term standard taxonomy is here used in the context of clear ownership. A standard taxonomy is owned by an authoritative body and responsibility for the quality is taken by the owner. Obvious taxonomy owners are governments, regulators and standard setters. Ownership can be linked with creation, maintenance, publication and/or certification of the taxonomy. 
A custom taxonomy is not owned by an authoritative body.
Base-taxonomy and extension-taxonomy refer to the XBRL mechanism where an extension-taxonomy refers to -or imports- a base-taxonomy to expand the available reporting concepts and/or their relations.
XBRL assurance can be described using following model: 
Description.
Audit objectives and approach.
The following, mainly XBRL specific reporting steps serve as a basis for the audit approach. The auditor checks that: 
The distinction between a standard (base) taxonomy and a custom (extension) taxonomy is important for the auditor. A standard taxonomy is normally owned, created and published by the government or regulator. It is the responsibility of the government or regulator to create a taxonomy that is correct. The quality of a standard taxonomy is fixed input for the auditor. The auditor just needs to check -with help of software tools- that the right taxonomy is used. 
With a custom (extension) taxonomy this is not the case. The auditor needs to validate the custom (extension) taxonomy, a secondary audit object. He needs to perform an audit to check if this taxonomy complies with regulations and if it is accurate and complete.
A significant difference with paper based assurance is the concept of material misstatement. Material misstatement concerns the accuracy of the audit opinion on a financial statement or filing as a whole. An XBRL report contains a collection of individually identifiable business facts. The facts are building blocks of an XBRL report. Material misstatement in an XBRL report concerns the individually identifiable business facts.
Audit report.
The most common audit report in the world is an external auditor's report on an auditee's financial statements and its accompanying notes. XBRL assurance covers different audit reports depending on the primary and secondary audit objects.
To let the auditor to give an opinion on fair view is not obvious. An XBRL report (instance) contains little presentation metadata. More presentation metadata is needed to present the XBRL report in a human readable manner.
The auditor opts for an approach whereby the current audit object (a paper based report) will be cut in two new audit objects, each with its own audit report and opinion. The primary audit object is the instance containing all the business facts. The secondary audit object contains the presentation or rendering metadata. 
The split in primary and secondary audit objects with different audit reports (and opinions) is necessary to prevent any confusion about the assurance the auditor adds to the XBRL financial statement instance or any other XBRL report without presentation in a human readable form.
One approach to this is to have different auditor opinions on the primary audit object and the secondary object that combined make clear the XBRL report provides a fair view.
Electronic Signature.
This aspect covers the unbreakable linkage of the audit report and auditor's signature to the (primary or secondary) audit object. Both the primary and the secondary audit objects are electronic files which can be altered without leaving a trace. 
All this means that the auditor must use techniques like encryption and electronic signatures, ensuring that his opinion actually came from him and is permanently linked to the audited XBRL audit object without any unauthorized changes.
Other aspects.
The XBRL standard has the ability to define business rules. These business rules can be found in different places in the XBRL taxonomy, that is in datatypes or linkbases. Application of these business rules will contribute to the reliability of the XBRL report. The business rules can be used by the reporting company, the taxonomy author or the auditor.

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? New Zealand

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? New Zealand was a New Zealand game show based on the original British format of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". The show was hosted by Mike Hosking. The main goal of the game was to win one million New Zealand dollars by answering 15 multiple-choice questions correctly. There were four "lifelines". It was broadcast on the TVNZ station TV ONE. The show was taped in Melbourne, Australia on the set of the Australian version of the show. 
One contestant, Kristin Castle, made New Zealand television history after walking away with NZ$250,000, the highest amount of money ever given to a single person on New Zealand television. The show received wide media coverage after the first ever contestant on the show, Courtney Washington, walked away with nothing after incorrectly answering the question about BMW supplying New Zealand's new fleet of ministerial limousines.
Rules.
As in the syndicated United States' version, contestants were selected for the show through a qualifying test instead of the traditional "Fastest Finger First" as seen on the British version. Contestants sit in the "Hot Seat" and are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Questions are multiple choice and contestants choose between a possible four answers, sometimes with the aid of lifelines. On answering a question correctly the contestant plays for a bigger sum of money, getting ever closer to the maximum amount of one million dollars. 
The traditional 15-question money tree was used and there was no clock.
The complete sequence of prizes is as follows. Guaranteed safe levels, where the contestant is guaranteed this amount of money to take home, regardless of any subsequent questions they may get wrong, are in bold. 
Prize levels
The contestants' run ends when they either answer a question incorrectly, decide to not answer a question and walk away with their prize money, or if they answer all 15 questions correctly (winning $1 million).
Lifelines.
If at any point the contestants are unsure of the answer to a question, they use one or more "lifelines". After using lifelines, contestants can either answer the question, use another lifeline, or walk away and keep the money (except for the Switch lifeline).

Live Partition Mobility

Live Partition Mobility is a chargeable feature of IBM POWER6 and POWER7 servers, available since 2007, that allows a running LPAR to be relocated from one system to another. In concept, it is similar to VMware VMotion.
The source and target systems must have access to the same network and SANs but need not be of the same type, the only requirement is they use POWER6 or POWER7 processors. Partitions that are to be relocated must be fully virtualized (i.e. have no dedicated I/O adapters) although it is possible to use multi-pathing software to fail over to virtual adapters for the duration of the move. 
Any sized partition can be moved; essentially, memory is copied asynchronously from one system to another to create a clone of a running partition, with "dirty" pages being re-copied as necessary. When a threshold is reached (i.e. when a high percentage of the pages have been successfully copied across), the partition is transitioned to the target machine and any remaining pages are copied across synchronously. The agents which carry out the memory copying are nominated Virtual I/O Servers on each machine; a standard Ethernet network is used for data transmission. 
Live Partition Mobility is used to avoid outages for planned server maintenance, for load balancing across multiple servers and for energy conservation.

Taylor column

A Taylor column is a feature of the coriolis effect. It was named after Geoffrey Ingram Taylor. Rotating fluids that are perturbed tend to form columns parallel to the axis of rotation called Taylor columns.
In a rotating fluid a strongly buoyant ball (such as a pingpong ball) will rise to the surface only slowly. Fluid that is shifted from its position in the rotating system tends to be pushed back to the point it is shifted away from, the faster the rotation rate, the smaller the radius of the inertial circle.
In a non-rotating fluid the fluid parts above the rising ball and closes in underneath it, offering relatively little resistance to the ball. In a rotating fluid, if certain conditions are met, the ball needs to push up a whole column of fluid above it, and it needs to drag a whole column of fluid along beneath it in order to rise to the surface.
A rotating fluid has a specific kind of rigidity, it does not quite act like a fluid anymore.
History.
Taylor columns were first observed by William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, in 1868. Taylor columns were featured in lecture demonstrations by Kelvin in 1881 and by John Perry in 1890. The phenomenon is explained via the Taylor-Proudman theorem, and it has been investigated by Taylor, Grace, Stewartson, and Maxworthy — among others.

Stonehenge, Virginia

Stonehenge is an unincorporated community in Albemarle County, Virginia, United States. Its elevation is 420 feet (128 m).
The Stonehenge subdivision was created from the farm with the same name that included the land of the subdivision and land adjacent to the community from Alwood Drive off Rio Road to the top of the hill and beyond along Rio Road. The farm was originally named and owned by Professor William Bradford Alwood. Professor Alwood was known for his accomplishments as a horticulturist, chemist, entomologist, and mycologist. From 1888 to 1904 he was professor and head of the department of horticulture, mycology and entomology and co-director of the agricultural experiment station at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (now Virginia Tech). Alwood was known worldwide for his expertise in fruit culture. He single-handedly saved the Virginia fruit industry from destruction by an introduced insect, in 1892, the San Jose Scale. He started the Virginia State Horticultural Society (with the fruit growers around Crozet, VA), was the first state entomologist, and moved from VPI to Charlottesville in 1904. That is when he lived in a cottage (still occupied on Alwood Lane adjacent to the subdivision - built in 1890) while he built the farmhouse (still occupied off of Rockbrook Drive). Alwood and his family moved there after its completion and in 1907 he rented the property to the US Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Chemistry. From 1907 to 1913, it was designated as Stonehenge Laboratories and served as the national enology laboratory - Alwood was the head of the lab. From 1913 into the 1920s, the property was rented to the USDA Bureau of Entomology to serve as a research laboratory with the purpose of discovering controls for cereal insects. Alwood lived on the property and on his farm in Greenwood, VA (Mountain Hollow Farm) until his death in 1946. Professor Alwood and his family are buried in Riverview Cemetery. If one goes there they will take note of the prominent "Merite Agricole" medal etched into the grave marker. Professor Alwood was awarded the medal in 1907 for his contributions to France in enology and grape culture. He was truly a pioneer in agricultural science and one of the most talented and accomplished scientists at Virginia Tech and nationally in his discipline during his era.

Silva gallinaria

The Silva Gallinaria is a rich thicket characterized by evergreen trees and shrubs typical of the Macchia Mediterranea, which grows naturally on a sandy and devoid of water. The most common tree that reigns unchallenged is the Quercus Ilex called also Holm Oak. This kind of jungle resumed the general characteristics of the Mediterranean Evergreen Forest but is distinguished for being contextualized in the Campania territory, specifically inside the area and Cuma Licola, and the historical baggage that inherits the early settlers of this coast: the Greeks, who founded the city of Cuma, which today form an acropolis.
The Gallinaria Silva, after the dissolution of the National Opera for Comabattenti today is part of the natural reserve park of the Regional Flegrei Field on the coast of Licola - Cuma, in the Campania Region.
For his interesting natural and historical heritage can be made educational tours organized by NPO in the territory.
Another company that manages the urban transport by bus is the CTP.
Vegetation.
Is typical of the Campi Flegrei, an extended time limits and without separating the beach from Cuma marshy rear part, until you reach the chain Massico and the Volturno River.
The words Silva Gallinaria was given time away from the coast colonizers. Basically this jungle takes over the distinctive characteristics of the Mediterranean evergreen forest. In this case, from underwater vegetation on the seabed persist meadows of Posidonia ocean, while on shore you notice a large presence of vegetation sand heaths, crucial for stabilizing the function that performs on dunali cords and the same.
On the coastal dunes in front is missing, the sparzio pungent, the euphorbia sea, the calcatreppola, fennel thorny grass and sand.
Particular attention are the plants that need forms of protection by man, such as halophytic nitrophilous like nappola thorny, the polygon sand, the sea ravastrello and many other crop that the roots lie in the sand by opposing the erosion and corrosion. Requires special protection of the Giglio Cuma (Pancratium maritimum).
Dunes inwards extends the jungle itself. A vast forest of oaks, with the presence of pines and Roverelli, suggestively around the coastline, of mixed shrubs and plants typical of the Mediterranean, such as mastic, strawberry tree, rosemary, myrtle, heather, rock, and many others.
Moreover, since the reclamation (1932 approximately) the entire area is cut by channels, where they found the place rows of reeds and rushes.
The Silva Gallinaria in the history.
Mentioned many times by authors like Cicero and Juvenal, in the past was used (according to Strabo) for the construction of vessels in the fleet of Sesto Pompeo during the Civil War, causing a massive thinning of trees mainly Leccio, good for the quality of the wood having them a variety of oak, while other areas of the forest were intended to pasture, particularly the producers of oak acorns.
The result caused by the depletion of tree belt, which was a providential defense windbreaks for crops behind, took effect as the burning of plantations, no longer sheltered from strong winds and Libeccio Maestrale coming from the sea, justifying the setting up of rows of poplars planted by man.
In different eras, the Gallinari Silva, was temutissima by merchants for the perils of robbers who were hiding. They used it as a nest for shelter that offered them had all'impenetrabilità of dense vegetation.
Animals.
The heritage of the Wild Animal hosts a great variety of animal species, especially marsh birds that find shelter and rest after the long migration. Among the mammals are grim foxes, hares, rabbits and wild marten. From a bird, among many are: Sylvia melanocephala, wren, blackbird, chaffinch, magpie, owl, robin, green, and barbagianni Miyamoto.
The forest also provides shelter all'upupa, the cuckoo, the woodcock, the thrush. Instead, the wetlands are: gallinella water, germani real coot, and sometimes even the heron cinerino. Among the woods and shoreline, you see the typical flying seabirds such as gulls real and common gull, the Starna common and Starna gambenere, along with many Waders, including gambecchio woodcock and sea.
Among the reptiles, are the biacco, the grass snake by the collar, the Lacerta bilineata and rare sightings have occurred even Lacerta viridis, while among amphibians dominates the green frog.
Also on the beach nest Caretta caretta sea turtle.
Protection's forms.
Today, the beach front Cuma la Selva, is protected by European legislation and is one of the sites of Community Importance (SCI) in the presence of that endemics and is considered a Special Protection Area (SPA) for the sensitive habitat of the dune.

Ghostlight Theatre

Ghostlight Theatre (also known as Starry Night Theatre) is a theater company located in North Tonawanda, New York. The building was originally a Methodist Church, known as Deutsche Vereinigte Evangelische Friedens Gemeinde (German United Evangelical Peace Congregation) of North Tonawanda.
History.
Construction started in 1889 to serve as a Methodist church for the German Immigrants who were separated from the rest of the immigrant population. This was caused by the construction of the Erie Canal, which in effect segregated the residents of Tonwanda and North Tonawanda.
The request to separate was rejected by the Synod at the time, and congregational members decided to splinter off and form a church that had no affiliation, thereby becoming a Frieden Church, or Free Church.
It served that role until June 2000, when it moved to its new location in Amherst, New York. In January 2001, the building was then purchased by Starry Night Theatre, Inc., and the name was changed to "The Ghostlight Theatre".
Current events.
The building currently seats 214 people, and runs its shows throughout the year. Each season includes a fall thriller, a holiday classic, a winter drama, a spring comedy and a summer musical. Past shows include "A Christmas Carol", by Charles Dickens, and "Little Women".
The Starry Night Theatre group is run by L. Don Swartz, who writes many of the plays that are performed at the Ghostlight Theatre, such as "All Through the Night", "The Birds That Stay", and "A Night of Dark Intent".
The building has also had some reports of paranormal activity, with at least four paranormal investigation groups, such as Western New York Paranormal, Erie County Paranormal Association, Soul Seekers United and Buffalo Paranormal Society.
Many of these groups have purportedly experienced ghost sightings, recorded instances of Electronic Voice Phenomena, among other experiences.

Sebastiano Maffettone

Sebastiano Maffettone (1948) is University Professor and Dean of Political Science at Luiss ‘G. Carli’ University of Rome, where he teaches Political Philosophy and Theories of Globalization. He taught in several Italian universities (Turin, Palermo, Naples and Rome) as well as International universities (Harvard, Columbia, Boston College, Tufts University, Paris, Dehli, University of Pennsylvania to mention a few). Maffettone graduated summa cum laude from the University of Naples in 1970, and he completed his graduate studies in social philosophy LSE in 1976, under the supervision of philosophers such as Karl Popper and Amartya K. Sen.
Early Work.
In the late ‘70s, Maffettone translated into Italian A Theory of Justice, the work of the American philosopher John Rawls, whose influence defined the focus of Maffettone’s philosophical approach. Rawls’s liberal perspective and the liberal approach on social and political issues became the milestone of his lifelong research.
Committed to bringing Rawls’s innovative thought to Europe, Maffettone begun to be widely known for his active participation in the academic life, earning the merit of having introduced important scientific novelties, especially in the Italian cultural debate. Besides his growing academic production, Maffettone started to contribute to the public debate through collaborations with major Italian newspapers such as Corriere della Sera, Il Mattino, Il Messaggero, Il Sole24ore and magazines such as Panorama, L’Espresso, and Reset. For his commitment in the current public debate, Maffettone is considered a public intellectual.
He has also founded and edited philosophy journals (Notizie di Politeia and Filosofia e questioni pubbliche) and research centers (Centro per la Ricerca e lo Studio dei Diritti Umani and Center for Ethics and Global Politics), published scholarly articles on different subjects, and contributed to the public debate on various cultural issues thanks to a wide network of international relationships, participation in seminars, workshops and conferences in Italy and abroad.
One of Maffettone’s contributions to the Italian academy probably is the creation of the Società italiana di filosofia politica (the Italian Society of Political Philosophy). Under his presidency, the society became a point of reference for the Italian political philosophers, and the political life of the country.
Main works.
Maffettone is author of 16 volumes, many of which have deeply influenced European scientific community. Two of his books, Il valore della vita (1998), and Etica pubblica (2001) bridge the gap between applied ethics and political theory, which represents a recurrent theme of Maffettone’s philosophical project. Il valore della vita presents a rationalist and liberal Lebenphilosophie. Its basic underpinnings come from bioethics, but go beyond this and propose a non-religious, comprehensive theory of life. Etica pubblica grounds a public understanding of ethics, which the author brought to the attention of the Italian public. The most widely read and criticized chapters were those on business ethics. It is worth noting how, in the case of both these books, theoretical and practical experiences have found a felicitous convergence.
Together with Ronald Dworkin, Maffettone published I fondamenti del liberalismo (2008) in which the two authors present their views of liberalism, agreeing in some areas and diverging on others, to begin with the relationship between ethics and politics. This book opened an important critical discussion on liberalism in Italy, which is still ongoing these very days.
Recently, the most importance evidence of his intellectual achievements can be seen in his book La pensabilita del mondo (2006, the English version is forthcoming), where he presents an original theory within the field of ethics of international relations. Maffettone’s view is based on the idea of “pluralistic integration,” which tries to represent an alternative to cosmopolitanism. The core idea is that liberalism and democracy cannot be imposed from the outside but must come from inside a culture or a nation. The same kind of argument was cashed out in two articles in English, one on the European model of “normative regionalism” (published “The Monist”), the other on global justice (forthcoming in the collective UNESCO volume, edited by Thomas Pogge).
Among his last publications, there is a solid and comprehensive introduction to the thought of John Rawls (Rawls: An Introduction, Polity Press 2010). In this work, Maffettone interprets Rawls along three hermeneutical hypotheses: the interpretive hypothesis; the methodological hypothesis; and the theoretical hypothesis.
The interpretive hypothesis concerns the much-debated question of the continuity or discontinuity between Rawls 1 (1950–80) and Rawls 2 (1980–2002). Prima facie, discontinuity seems to prevail, given that Rawls’ main books discuss three different subjects: A Theory of Justice deals with social justice; Political Liberalism deals with the main flaws of A Theory of Justice as well as with political legitimacy; The Law of Peoples extends and modifies the previous model in the light of global justice. However, after reflection one can detect a substantial continuity. Of course, there are significant partial discontinuities, like the ones Rawls enjoins with regard to rational choice theory and, more relevantly, with regard to some passages within the third part of A Theory of Justice concerning stability.
The methodological hypothesis is designed to complement the interpretive hypothesis by presenting a unitary thread through which we can trigger the desired continuity in our reading of Rawls. This thread follows the basic device Rawls never abandoned, namely the ‘priority of the right’. 
The theoretical hypothesis is based on the idea that the asymmetry between the right and the good depends on a deeper dialectics between justification and legitimation. According to this distinction, justification looks for the best theoretical argument, is intrinsically substantive, goes top-down and is rooted in the moral and metaphysical bases of a specific culture. Legitimation, on the other hand, is normally based on an institutional practice, concerns mainly the inputs of a political process, goes bottom- up and does not directly appeal to the moral and metaphysical roots of a culture.
Maffettone claims that justification and legitimation must be seen as complementary. Assuming the fact of pluralism in contemporary liberal-democratic societies, we can have different plausible justifications in reciprocal conflict, but we have to rely on the same institutional legitimation for the sake of stability (for the right reasons).
Main contribution to the Italian debate.
Regarding bioethics, Maffettone was a member of what was probably the first Italian ethical commission in a hospital, under the direction of Umberto Veronesi (with whom Maffettone continues to work in these years) at the Istituto Tumori, based in Milan.
Maffettone also formulated the theoretical outline of business ethics, which is perhaps the most important Italian deontological code; moreover, he wrote many other codes and formulated other social budgets – among which the one proposed to Confindustria in 1992 in an extremely delicate political and social moment for Italy.
Maffettone’s synthesis of theoretical reflections and practical applications can be tracked also in his participation to the scientific commissions of influential cultural foundations (like the Fondazione Adriano Olivetti and the Fondazione Einaudi in Rome), and as a consultant on applied-science issues for institutions such as ENEA, CISPEL and MIUR.
Maffettone is most certainly among the Italian scholars with the strongest connections with foreign academic and scientific institutions. Several times he has been awarded a visiting professorship in the most prestigious American Universities (such as Harvard, NYU, Columbia, Tufts, Boston College). He was also a Senior Fellow “Ethics and Professions” program at Harvard University, and visiting professor in France (in the Maison des Sciences de l’Homme and at Sciences-Po in Paris), as well as in England (LSE) and in India. He has held lectures and courses in more than forty countries (just in the last two years in China, India, France, Great Britain, the United States, and Austria, to name a few), and he took part in many international conferences, publishing his contributions in the conference proceedings.
Maffettone’s commitment to promote research programs with an international relevance is lastly manifest in creation of a doctoral program in Political Theory at LUISS, one of the first program taught in English, which sees the participation of many worldwide recognized scholars.

Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall

Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall (or simply Sta. Lucia East Mall) is a large shopping mall in the Philippines.
The mall is owned by Sta. Lucia Realty & Development Inc and is the largest shopping mall in the Eastern District of Metro Manila. The mall is located at Marcos Highway cor. Felix Avenue (formerly Imelda Avenue), San Isidro, Cainta, Rizal. The mall has 2 buildings near Robinsons Place Metro East, Sta. Lucia Residenze and is interconnected by a footbridge.
History.
In 1991, certain of the market potentials in the east side of the metropolis and driven by the desire to diversify, Sta. Lucia East Realty and Development, Inc. (SLRDI) built Phase 1 of the first ever, soon-to-be center of a one-stop shopping and recreation haven in Rizal - the Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall (SLEGM).
Phase 1 houses the first well-equipped theaters in town, reputable food chains (i.e. Shakeys, Jollibee and Chowking) and well-known fashion boutiques (i.e. Pink soda, Petit Monde, Artwork). The venture elicited overwhelming patronage and undoubtedly boosted the commercial activities in Rizal and the nearby municipalities.
Two years later, Phase II was formally opened offering better facilities, more specialty stores, service centers, additional cinemas, a 32-lane bowling center, an entertainment arcade (GWOF) and a junior department store.
The resounding success in sales and operations prepared SLEGM to join the ranks of other retail giants. On May 18, 1998, Phase III was unveiled which offered bigger spaces and more comprehensive shopping and entertainment facilities that can be compared with the best in Asia. The expansion paved way to a 22,000 square meter, three-level, full-line Department Store that houses the leading brands in the retail industry; more upscale stores and restaurants; and the many firsts in shopping and leisure - a 32-lane Brunswick Bowling Center, state-of-the-art cinemas equipped with Sony Digital Sound System and a 10-meter high ceiling entertainment center called World of Fun where children of all ages can play, party and socialize.
Phase III also introduced the 7,000 square meter supermarket with new point of sales (POS) terminals and spacious aisles for buying convenience. Added amenities include the construction of walkalator, scenic elevators, and a multi-level parking facility. Home Gallery opened its door with the finest selection of charming but functional décor, furniture and appliances for people who want real home improvement. Planet Toys kicked off with more famous brands to the delight of kids, toddlers and even parents.
Since then, the mall has grown and matured through the years. In 2005, Phase III cinemas were renovated and became known as the Theatre Zone. Theatre Zone brings movie experience a step higher with widest cinema screens, numerous reclining love seats, and Dolby Digital EX surround system.
This year, Sta. Lucia Realty & Development Inc. is currently building the Phase 4 Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall beside Sta. Lucia Residenze and the connector of Phase 3 2nd Floor to New Phase 4 2nd Floor for the better shopping.

Rudolf Much

Rudolf Much (born 7 September 1862 and died 8 March 1936 in Vienna), the son of archaeologist Matthäus Much, was an Austrian Germanist, considered one of the founding fathers of Germanic studies.
His 1887 dissertation "On the Prehistory of Germany" ("Zur Vorgeschichte Deutschlands") reflects the interest in Germanic antiquity Much shared with his teacher Wilhelm Tomaschek, whose special field of interest was the tribal territories of the Germanic peoples in antiquity. In 1906, Much became professor at the newly founded chair of Germanic Antiquity ("Germanische Altertumskunde und Sprachgeschichte") in Vienna, which he held until his retirement in 1932.
Much was sympathetic towards German nationalism and the interwar period calls for a Großdeutschland prohibited by the Allies.
He also became a member of the Catholic-German nationalist "Deutsche Gemeinschaft" secret society. Much cannot, however, be described as sympathetic towards the rise of the Nazi Party, and he was careful to put scholarship before ideology, and his recensions often expressed disdain for ideologically motivated bad scholarship. 
Much is nevertheless treated critically in more recent assessment, his German nationalism in retrospect appearing as a precursor to Nazi ideology.
Much's major opus is his commentary of Tacitus' "Germania", published posthumously in 1937-
He also contributed some 260 articles to the "Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde"

<doc id="19774363" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774363" title="Large regiment">
Large regiment

A large regiment is a multi-battalion infantry formation of the British Army. First formed in the 1960s, large regiments are the result of the amalgamation of three or more existing single-battalion regiments, and perpetuate the traditions of each of the predecessor units.
Origins.
Following the Defence Review announced in 1957, the regular infantry of the British Army consisted of single-battalion regiments grouped in 14 administrative "brigades", each of three or four battalions. Although the battalions in a brigade shared a common depot and cap badge, they maintained a separate regimental identity. Reductions in troop numbers following the 1957 review had necessitated the amalgamation of pairs of regiments within the brigades from 1958 to 1961, a process that sometimes proved controversial.
The idea of the "large regiment" originated in 1962. Speaking in the House of Commons on 8 March. The Minister of War, John Profumo, stated that there was not going to be a further extensive reorganisation of army units. However, talking of the need to increase flexibility in the services, he noted that the regimental system of the infantry could be said to "stand in the way of change". He stated that the transition from the regimental to the brigade system "had on the whole been going well" and it was now time to see if there were "tangible advantages from the point of view of recruiting and flexibility" to be gained from a "large regiment system".
On 16 March "The Times" reported that the War Office were in the early stages of planning for the creation of large regiments. The plan involved the conversion of the existing brigades into regiments, with each of the regiments forming a numbered battalion of the large regiment. The creation of the multi-battalion regiments would allow the infantry to be expanded or reduced as needed. This could be done by the increase or decrease in the number of battalions of each regiment, rather than by the emotive process of merging or disbanding historic single-battalion regiments. The report noted that this process had effectively already begun in the East Anglian and Green Jackets Brigades, where regiments had been redesignated or amalgamated as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd East Anglian Regiments and 1st, 2nd and 3rd Green Jackets.
The first large regiments.
In February 1964, approval for the creation of the first large regiment was given. The Royal Anglian Regiment was to be formed from the four regular battalions of the East Anglian Brigade. The regiment was formed on 1 September. In May 1965 it was announced that the regiments of the Green Jackets Brigade were to become the three-battalion Royal Green Jackets from 1 January 1966.
In September 1965, figures showed that the new large regiments were recruiting more successfully than the remaining single-battalion regiments, some of which were only at rifle company strength. In particular the Welsh, North Irish and Lancastrian Brigades were under strength. It was thought that the Yorkshire Brigade and Home Counties Brigade were likely to form large regiments in the near future, while plans to merge the battalions of the Highland Brigade were only being delayed by failure to agree on a common tartan to be worn. While the Army Board could not compel regiments to amalgamate, it was their stated ""wish and intention"" that they should. The survival of the weaker brigades was under doubt, while a feasibility study into the formation of a single "Corps of Infantry" was initiated.
In June 1966, it was announced that the regiments of the Home Counties Brigade had agreed to form the third large regiment. Accordingly, on 31 December, the four regiments became The Queen's Regiment.
By July 1967, three more Brigades had opted to become large regiments. All three mergers occurred in 1968: the Fusilier Brigade became the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers on 23 April, the North Irish Brigade became the Royal Irish Rangers on 1 July and the Light Infantry Brigade became The Light Infantry on 10 July. 
The Defence White Paper of 1967 reduced the number of infantry battalions, with the large regiments all losing one battalion in 1968. The six brigades that had chosen not to form large regiments were also to lose a battalion: the decision to amalgamate a pair of regiments or to disband the junior regiment being left to the council of colonels of the brigade.
On 1 July 1968, the brigade system was abandoned, with the infantry being grouped in five administrative "divisions" instead. Individual regimental cap badges were reintroduced and the creation of large regiments effectively ceased. Following a change of government in 1970, a policy of retaining single-battalion regiments was shown with the reversal of decisions to disband the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and to merge the Gloucestershire and Royal Hampshire Regiments.
Options for Change.
Under the Options for Change defence cuts announced in 1990, the number of infantry battalions was to be reduced. While most of the reductions were effected by the merger of pairs of single-battalion regiments, two existing large regiments were further enlarged and the infantry regiments of the Brigade of Gurkhas became a large regiment:
Over the next few years, the junior battalions of most large regiments were disbanded, leaving them with two regular battalions.
Future Infantry Structure.
In 2004, the Army Board announced the ending of the "Arms Plot" system, where individual battalions changed role and moved station every 2 to 6 years. The Board argued that the existing system led to seven or eight battalions being unavailable at any time due to retraining while changing roles. The lack of stability for the families of soldiers due to constant moving of locations was also cited as a disadvantage. In the future, battalions would retain the same role and largely the same location. As part of this process, all infantry would be organised as large single cap badge regiments of two or more battalions. At the same time, there was to be a reduction in the number of battalions, with amalgamations to take place within the administrative divisions created in 1968: The Scottish Division was to lose 1 battalion, the King's Division 2 and the Prince of Wales's Division 1. Each division was to consider one of two options:
The results of the reorganisation, which were completed in September 2007, were:
The Scottish Division formed a single "large/large" regiment, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, on 28 March 2006 from:
The Queen's Division adopted the "small/large" option, retaining the three existing regiments with two regular battalions each:
The King's Division also adopted the "small/large" option:
The Prince of Wales' Division formed two "small/large" regiments:
The Light Division formed a single five-battalion "large/large" regiment, The Rifles on 1 February 2007 from:
The Territorial Army has also been reorganised so that each large regiment has one or more TA battalions.
The Guards Division and those regiments outside the divisional structure (The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment), The Royal Gurkha Rifles and the Parachute Regiment were left unreformed.

Stan Wootton

Stanley Eli Wootton (28 April 1895 – 20 March 1962) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne and Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He also played a first-class cricket match for Victoria.
Leopold recruit Stan Wootton started his VFL career at South Melbourne in 1915 but did not appear again until 1920 due to war commitments. He spent the 1920 season as a forward and topped South Melbourne's goal-kicking with 28 goals, including a career best haul of five against Melbourne at Lake Oval. In 1923 he crossed to Richmond and played six senior games for the club before retiring.
Wootton's cricket career was brief, but very notable as he scored a century in his only first-class innings, against Tasmania at Hobart. A wicket-keeper, he stumped two Tasmanian batsmen before top scoring with 105 runs. As Victoria successfully chased down Tasmania's 4th innings target with five wickets to spare, Wootton wasn't required to bat again and thus finished his career with an average of 105.
A nephew, Richard also played for Victoria later in the decade.

Performic acid

Performic acid (PFA) is an organic compound with the formula CH2O3. It is an unstable colorless liquid which can be produced by mixing formic acid with hydrogen peroxide. Owing to its oxidizing and disinfecting action, it is used in the chemical, medical and food industries. 
Properties and applications.
Performic acid is a colorless liquid soluble in water, alcohols, ether, benzene, chloroform and other organic solvents. Its strong oxidizing properties are used for cleaving disulfide bonds in protein mapping, as well as for epoxidation, hydroxylation and oxidation reactions in organic synthesis. In the medical and food industries, performic acid is commonly used to disinfect equipment. It is effective against viruses, bacterial spores, algae, microscopic fungi and mycobacteria, as well as other microorganisms such as zooplankton. The popularity of performic acid as a sterilizer originates from the safe nature of its degradation products, mostly carbon dioxide, oxygen and water. The disinfecting action of performic acid is also faster than that of the related compounds peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The major drawbacks of performic acid are handling dangers related to its high reactivity, as well as instability, especially upon heating, which means that the acid must be used within about 12 hours of it being synthesised.
Synthesis.
Synthesis of pure performic acid has not been reported. Aqueous solutions (up to 90%) can be prepared by mixing 70–98 wt.% of formic acid (in water) with 35–50 wt% of hydrogen peroxide. 
This reaction is reversible and can be used for large scale industrial production if accelerated with a catalyst; however, its temperature must be kept below 80–85 °C to avoid an explosion. The catalyst can be nitric, hydrofluoric, phosphoric or sulfuric acid or their salts; it can also be an organic compound containing at least one ester group, such as carboxylic acid ester or peracetic acid.
Safety.
Performic acid is non-toxic; it does irritate the skin, but less so than peracetic acid. Concentrated acid (above 50%) is highly reactive; it readily decomposes upon heating, and explodes upon rapid heating to 80–85 °C. It may ignite or explode at room temperature when combined with flammable substances, such as formaldehyde, benzaldehyde, or aniline, and explodes violently upon addition of metal powders. For this reason, spilled performic acid is diluted with cold water and collected with neutral, non-flammable inorganic absorbents, such as vermiculite.

Nicholas Felton (bishop)

Nicholas Felton (1556–1626) was an English academic, bishop of Bristol from 1617 to 1619, and then bishop of Ely.
Life.
He was born in Great Yarmouth, and educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. He was rector of St Mary-le-Bow church in London, from 1597 to 1617; and also rector at St Antholin, Budge Row. St Antholin's was on Watling Street, and it has been suggested that the 1606 play "The Puritan, or the Widow of Watling Street" alludes to Felton through the name Nicholas St Antlings of one of the Widow's serving men.
He was Master at Pembroke, where he became a Fellow in 1583, from 1616 to 1619. In university politics he conspicuously supported Thomas Howard, Earl of Berkshire, against George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, in an election for the position of Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, in 1626. King Charles I of England supported Buckingham, and this contest became a test of strength of the religious groups, Puritan and Anglican. He employed as chaplain Edmund Calamy, who had studied at Pembroke, already dissenting from orthodox Anglican belief.
His death was the occasion of an early Latin poem by John Milton.

Topoľčany pogrom

Topoľčany pogrom was an anti-Jewish riot (pogrom) in Topoľčany, Czechoslovakia on 24 September 1945 during which 48 people were injured.
Details.
There were about 3,200 Jews living in Topoľčany before World War II, of which 550 survived the Holocaust and returned to the town after the war ended. Anti-semitism was widespread at that time due to both Slovak state official policy and also the strong economic position of Jews, which contrasted with a lack of basic commodities among the majority population.
According to the protocol of county police boss Zidor, rumors began to spread in the town two days before the pogrom that Jews are about to overtake a local church school. The school was run by Catholic nuns at that time. Also, there were rumors that Jews had already created a separate classroom for Jewish children, in which they desecrated a crucifix. Further, according to rumors, the Jews were said to had overtaken a school in the nearby village of Bojná, run by Catholic monks. Local women wanted to protest against the rumored actions, but local authorities refused them. A pack of people, mostly women, then entered the school. Coincidentally, a Jewish doctor was at the time vaccinating children against smallpox in one of the school's classrooms. Some of the vaccinated children cried, which gave base for a new rumor to spread among the angry crowd: a Jewish doctor poisons Slovak children! People then attacked and beat the doctor. As new rumors spread to the streets, many more Jews were beaten both in the streets and in their homes. Jewish property was plundered in the process.

Laughing Baby

The Laughing Baby is an Internet neologism given to a YouTube viral video of a baby laughing. The video became an internet phenomenon and has had a total of over 69 million views. Originally uploaded by a Swedish man under the pseudonym of spacelord72, and later re-uploaded and popularized by another user known as BlackOleg, the "Laughing Baby" is one of the few internet memes that have entered popular culture. The original uploaded by spacelord72, has had 7 million views as of Feb 2013 and the reposting by BlackOleg, titled HaHaHa, achieved 62 million views by Sep 2008.
The video.
The Laughing Baby video, which was shot by a Swedish man in his kitchen in 2006, has a running time of 1:40, and involves a fixed camera situated on William Nilsson, a blond-haired, blue eyed baby, who laughs after brief interjections from a voice in the background (presumably his father, Kjell-Åke Andersson). The video opens with the Swedish text: "kan man ha roligare" which translates as "Can you have any more fun?"
Comments.
The clip has become known for its disparate variety of commenters – from the amused to those concerned for the baby's health. These comments were the focus of a "Slate" article by Michael Agger, who remarked that uploading the video was like "dipping a bunny into acid," further adding that the "Laughing Baby has become an internet monument, and posting a remark is like tagging your name on the Statue of Liberty."
Impact.
The Laughing Baby video became a worldwide phenomenon and the tenth most viewed YouTube video of all time. Its success is attributed to "cuteness" and its "adorable nature". The video appeared on the front pages of web portals such as msn.com, and has been the theme of several ringtones, which helped to further increase its familiarity and popularity. The baby was featured in the "South Park" episode "Canada on Strike", where he appeared alongside other YouTube celebrities such as Tay Zonday and Chris Crocker.
The "Laughing Baby" video was shown to Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip during a 16 October 2008 visit to Google headquarters in Victoria, London. The Queen remarked that the child was a "...lovely little thing, isn't it?" and that it was "Amazing a child would laugh like that."

Peter Costello (author)

Peter Costello is an author and editor, described by American critic Robert Hogan in the Dictionary of Irish literature “ a contemporary embodiment” of the “tradition in Irish literature of the independent scholar, who has an erudition embarrassing to the professional academic” 
Personal life.
Peter Costello was born in Dublin on 3 April 1946, the youngest son of James C. Costello, a consulting engineer, later professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Michigan, and his wife Margaret. He was educated in Dublin by the Jesuits at Gonzaga College and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1969. After some years abroad in the United States of America, England, and elsewhere, he returned to Ireland in 1975. He now lives in Dublin, with frequent visits to France and other countries. He is married with two sons.
Work.
He has written, edited, or contributed to some thirty seven books;and his interests have been extraordinarily wide-ranging—from Irish cultural,political and business histories, to books on animal mythology, research on the Piltdown man hoax of 1912, and books on Jules Verne and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
His main field of interest is Irish literature and history. "The Heart Grown Brutal" (1977) provides “a learned but very readable study of writers who flourished from the death of Parnell to the death of Yeats, and which called attention to several significant figures outside the academic pantheon”.  The novelist John Broderick, in reviewing the book, called it “this wise and often brilliant history”.  Peter Costello is an internationally recognized authority on the life and times of James Joyce, on whom he has four books: "James Joyce" (1980); "Leopold Bloom: A Biography" (1981); "James Joyce—The Years of Growth, 1882-1915 "(1992); "The Life of Leopold Bloom: A Novel "(1992); With John Wyse Jackson he is the author of a biography James Joyce’s father" John Stanislaus Joyce" whose character was influential in both "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" and" Ulysses. "He has also published a biography of Flann O'Brien, "Flann O'Brien" (1987), written with Dutch academic Peter van de Kamp.
Peter Costello has also written in the field of cryptozoology, he has published "In Search of Lake Monsters" (1974), and "The Magic Zoo: The Natural History of Imaginary Animals" (1979). A second edition of "In Search of Lake Monsters" (1974), with a long Introduction by Dr Bernard Heuvelmans, “the father of cryptozoology” was published in French (1978).

Linda Lovelace

Linda Susan Boreman (January 10, 1949 – April 22, 2002), better known by her stage name Linda Lovelace, was an American pornographic actress who was famous for her performance in the enormously successful 1972 hardcore porn film "Deep Throat". She later denounced her pornography career and became a spokeswoman for the anti-pornography movement.
Early life.
Boreman was born in Bronx, New York, to a working-class family. She was raised in an unhappy family as the daughter of John and Dorothy Boreman. Her mother was a harsh, domineering disciplinarian, and her father was a police officer who was seldom home. She attended private Catholic schools, including Saint John the Baptist (Yonkers, New York) and Maria Regina High School. She was nicknamed "Miss Holy Holy" in high school because she kept her dates at a safe distance. When Boreman was 16, her family moved to Florida after her father retired from the New York City police force. She gave birth to her first child at age 20. Shortly afterwards, Linda returned to New York to live and go to computer school. There she suffered serious injuries from a car accident requiring her to undergo a blood transfusion that caused her to need a liver transplant 18 years later.
Career.
Pornography.
While recovering at her parents' home, Boreman became involved with Chuck Traynor. According to Boreman, Traynor was violent and controlling. She said he forced her to move to New York, where he became her manager, pimp, and husband.
Coerced by Traynor, Boreman was soon performing as Linda Lovelace in hardcore "loops", short 8-mm silent films made for peep shows. Boreman starred in a 1971 bestiality film titled "Dog Fucker" (alternate title "Dogarama"). She later denied appearing in the film until several of the original loops proved otherwise. In 2013, Larry Revene, the cameraman who shot this film spoke about it for the first time, and asserted that Boreman was a willing participant and that no coercion took place.
In 1972, Boreman starred in "Deep Throat", in which she famously performed fellatio. The film achieved surprising and unprecedented popularity among mainstream audiences and even a review in "The New York Times". It played several times daily for over ten years at theaters in the Pussycat Theater chain (where Boreman did promotions, including leaving her hand and footprints in the cement sidewalk outside the Hollywood Pussycat), and the movie later became one of the first and highest-grossing X-rated videotape releases.
Media career after "Deep Throat".
In 1974 Boreman starred in the R-rated sequel "Deep Throat II", which a critic writing in "Variety" described as "the shoddiest of exploitation film traditions, a depressing fast buck attempt to milk a naïve public."
In 1975 Boreman left Traynor for David Winters, the producer of her 1976 film "Linda Lovelace for President" co-starring Micky Dolenz, which saw her on the campaign trail following a cross-country bus route mapped out in the shape of a penis. However, her career as an actress did not flourish, and her film appearances add up to only five hours of screen time. In her 1980 autobiography, "Ordeal", Lovelace maintained that those films used leftover footage from "Deep Throat"; however, she frequently contradicted this statement. She also posed for "Playboy", "Bachelor", and "Esquire" magazines between 1973 and 1974.
During the mid 1970s, she also took to smoking large quantities of marijuana combined with painkillers, but after her second marriage and the birth of her two children, she left the pornographic film business and found some happiness and stability.
In 1974, she published two "pro-porn" autobiographies, "Inside Linda Lovelace" and "The Intimate Diary of Linda Lovelace".
In 1976, she was chosen to play the title role in the erotic movie "Laure". However, according to the producer Ovidio G. Assonitis, Lovelace was "very much on drugs" at the time. She had already signed for the part when she decided that "God had changed her life," refused to do any nudity, and even objected to a statue of the Venus de Milo on the set because of its exposed breasts. She was replaced by French actress Annie Belle.
Charges against Chuck Traynor.
In her suit to divorce Traynor, she said that he forced her into pornography at gunpoint, and that in "Deep Throat" bruises from his beatings can be seen on her legs. She said that her husband "would force her to do these things by pointing an M-16 rifle at her head." Boreman said in her autobiography that her marriage had been plagued by violence, rape, forced prostitution, and private pornography. She wrote:
Lovelace's accusations provoked mixed responses. Skeptics included Traynor, who admitted to striking Lovelace but said it was part of a voluntary sex game. In Legs McNeil and Jennifer Osborne's 2005 book "The Other Hollywood", several witnesses, including "Deep Throat" director Gerard Damiano, state that Traynor beat Boreman behind closed doors, but they also question her credibility. Eric Edwards, Boreman's co-star in the dog sex films and other loops that featured Linda urinating on her sex partners, similarly discounts her credibility. According to Edwards, Boreman was a sexual "super freak" who had no boundaries and was a pathological liar. Adult-film actress Gloria Leonard is quoted as saying, "This was a woman who never took responsibility for her own [...] choices made; but instead blamed everything that happened to her in her life on porn." Corroboration for Lovelace's claim came from Andrea True, Lovelace's co-star in "Deep Throat 2", who, on a commentary DVD track of the documentary "Inside Deep Throat", stated that Traynor was a sadist and was disliked by the "Deep Throat 2" cast. Andrea Dworkin stated that the results of polygraph tests administered to Boreman support her assertions. Moreover, psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman notes that many details in Lovelace's memoir "Ordeal" are consistent with a diagnosis of Complex PTSD, such as Lovelace's description of a fragmented personality in the aftermath of alleged abuse.
Eric Danville, a journalist who covered the porn industry for nearly 20 years and wrote "The Complete Linda Lovelace" in 2001, said Boreman never changed her version of events that had occurred 30 years earlier with Traynor. When Danville told Boreman of his book proposal, he said she was overcome with emotion and saddened he had uncovered the bestiality film, which she had initially denied making and later maintained she had been forced to star in at gunpoint.
Boreman maintained she received no money for "Deep Throat" and that the $1,250 payment for her appearance was taken by Traynor.
Marchiano marriage.
In 1976, Boreman married Larry Marchiano, a cable installer who later owned a dry wall business. They had two children, Dominic (born 1977) and Lindsay (born 1980). They lived in a small town on Long Island called Center Moriches. Linda was going through a liver transplant at the time. For a while, marriage and particularly motherhood brought her some stability and happiness. In 1990, Larry's business went bankrupt and the family moved to Colorado.
In "The Other Hollywood", Boreman painted a largely unflattering picture of Marchiano, claiming he drank to excess, verbally abused her children, and was occasionally violent with her. They divorced in 1996. However, the divorce was civil and they remained in contact with each other for the remainder of her life.
Anti-pornography activism.
With the publication of "Ordeal" in 1980, Boreman joined the feminist anti-pornography movement. At a press conference announcing "Ordeal", she leveled many of the above-noted accusations against Traynor in public for the first time. She was joined by supporters Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, and members of Women Against Pornography. Boreman spoke out against pornography, stating that she had been abused and coerced. She spoke before feminist groups, at colleges, and at government hearings on pornography.
In 1986, Boreman published "Out of Bondage", a memoir focusing on her life after 1974. She testified before the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography in New York City, stating, "When you see the movie "Deep Throat", you are watching me being raped. It is a crime that movie is still showing; there was a gun to my head the entire time." Following Boreman's testimony for the Meese Commission, she gave lectures on college campuses, decrying what she described as callous and exploitative practices in the pornography industry.
In "The Other Hollywood", Boreman said she felt "used" by the anti-pornography movement. "Between Andrea Dworkin and Kitty MacKinnon, they've written so many books, and they mention my name and all that, but financially they've never helped me out. When I showed up with them for speaking engagements, I'd always get five hundred dollars or so. But I know they made a few bucks off me, just like everybody else."
Last years.
Boreman contracted hepatitis from the blood transfusion she received after her 1970 car accident. She underwent a liver transplant in 1987. In 2001, she was featured on "E! True Hollywood Story". The following year she did a lingerie pictorial as Linda Lovelace for the magazine "Leg Show". She said she did not object to the magazine shoot because "there's nothing wrong with looking sexy as long as it's done with taste."
On April 3, 2002, Boreman was involved in another serious automobile accident, suffering massive trauma and internal injuries. On April 22, 2002, she was taken off life support and died in Denver, Colorado, at the age of 53. Marchiano and their two children were present when she died. Boreman was interred at Parker Cemetery in Parker, Colorado.
Legacy.
The computer processing coordination system Linda was named after Linda Lovelace as a play on words because of the programming language Ada, which was named after computer pioneer Ada Lovelace.
Boreman's participation in "Deep Throat" was among the topics explored in the 2005 documentary "Inside Deep Throat".
Indie pop singer/songwriter Marc with a C released a 2008 album entitled "Linda Lovelace for President", which contained a song of the same name.
In 2008, "", based on two of Boreman's four autobiographies, debuted at the Hayworth Theater in Los Angeles. The score and libretto were written by Anna Waronker of the 1990s rock group that dog. and Charlotte Caffey of the '80s group the Go-Gos.
Lovelace is one of the main characters of the 2010 stage play "The Deep Throat Sex Scandal" by David Bertolino. The play follows the life and early career of Harry Reems as he enters the pornography industry, eventually filming "Deep Throat" and its resultant infamy and obscenity trial in Memphis, Tennessee, and Lovelace is a central figure. In July 2013, an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to make a film version of the play raised over $25,000.
As of 2011, two biographical films on Boreman were scheduled to begin production. One, titled "Lovelace", went into general release on August 9, 2013, with Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman directing, Amanda Seyfried as Lovelace, and Peter Sarsgaard as Chuck Traynor. The other, entitled "Inferno: A Linda Lovelace Story", starring Malin Åkerman, was scheduled to be directed by Matthew Wilder and produced by Chris Hanley and was scheduled to begin filming in early 2011. However, as of 2013, this project remains unproduced.
Tina Yothers, who was a child actress on "Family Ties", was cast as Lovelace in "Lovelace: The Musical".
Books.
Boreman has been the subject of five biographies, four authored or co-authored by her:

Pomatiidae

The family Pomatiidae is a taxonomic family of small operculate land snails, terrestrial gastropod mollusks that can be found over the warmer parts of the Old World. In the older literature, this family is designated as Pomatiasidae.
This family is a lineage closely related to the Littorinidae (periwinkles) common in coastal habitat. They have adapted to terrestrial life and are thus sometimes humorously called "winkles-come-ashore".
They are defined by a chalky operculum at the rear end of the body, the shape of their thick shell and their mouth and a characteristic spiral sculpture. The sexes are separate and can sometimes be recognised because the female shell is slightly larger than the male shell.
Taxonomy.
According to the Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005), the family Pomatiidae consists of two subfamilies:
Genera.
Genera within the family Pomatiidae include:
subfamily Pomatiinae
subfamily Annulariinae
tribe Annulariini
tribe Adamsiellini

<doc id="19774618" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774618" title="Reset (military)">
Reset (military)

Reset is an evolving military term currently used to describe the equipment refurbishment process. In current U.S. military terms, "reset" refers to "a series of actions to restore units to a desired level of combat capability commensurate with future mission requirements."
Context specific terminology.
The military term is somewhat like the financial term "reset", which is a generic concept in the financial world. Reset, which also known as "fixing," is a generic concept in the financial markets which refers to the determination and recording of a reference rate, usually in order to calculate the settlement value of a periodic payment schedule between two parties.
The military term is somewhat like the computing term "reset", which means to clear any pending errors or events and bring a system to normal condition or initial state.
The military term "reset" is unlike its finance and computing counterparts in that the military usage anticipates three related components: repairing, replacing and recapitalizing. Military reset, in simplest terms, is intended to reverse the effects of stress on all equipment. Initial funding from Congress was used to reset brigade combat teams involving about 4,000 soldiers and about 40,000 pieces of equipment returning from duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Repair.
Repair starts with an inspection followed by maintenance and possible replacement of some parts to bring equipment to original technical specifications. 
Replacement.
Replacement means to buy new or to replace equipment destroyed in battle or otherwise too damaged to fix. Also listed under replacement is reserve-component equipment which has been left overseas for other units to use. 
Recapitalizing.
Recapitalizing involves overhauling or restoring equipment to improve performance or make it like new from the factory. 
Timely funding would be designed to allow military depots to order repair parts in advance of equipment arrival.”
Strategic Reset.
In 2007, the "Washington Post" described as "strategic reset" a proposal by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that took the form of "an unusually detailed public explanation of the new American effort to create a de facto alliance between Israel and moderate Arab states against Iranian extremism."

<doc id="19774619" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774619" title="Piano ballad">
Piano ballad

In 19th century romantic music, a piano ballad is a piece for solo piano written in a "narrative" style, and often lyrical in nature. This type of work made its premiere with Chopin's first romantic ballad, the Ballade No. 1 in G minor, op. 23 written for piano in 1836.
Form.
The form of the ballad varied due to its independence from the formal compositional structures existing at the time. Ballads have often been characterized as "narrative" in style- "parts [that succeed one another in a determined order...their succession is governed by the relationships of causing and resulting by necessity or probability." 
The ballad of this time varied. In Chopin, for example, the common element throughout his ballads was the meter, commonly 6/8 time, and was based on thematic metamorphosis more than formal structures present at that time. Brahms' ballad, on the other hand, was clearer in form, and often relied on a three-part song form.
Ballads sometimes alluded to their literary predecessors. Some had obvious or supposed literary associations. For example, the ballads of Chopin could be evidence of such association — these four works of Chopin were supposedly inspired by the poetry of Adam Mickiewicz, who was a friend of Chopin. However, no such evidence directly from the composer exists. There was in fact not a concrete association to literature until Brahms debuted his four ballads (op. 10), which bear the title "After the Scottish ballad 'Edward' ".
Piano ballads have been written since the 19th century; several have been composed in the 20th century (see below).
Collaborative piano ballads.
The piano has also been used in works featuring other instruments, as well as voice. For example, Robert Schumann, a romantic composer and husband of Clara Schumann, wrote a set of two songs, "Balladen", Op. 122 (1852–53) which were written for piano and voice. Claude Debussy, a later composer, also wrote for piano and voice with his "Trois Ballades de François Villon" (, 1910).
Works for piano and orchestra also bearing the title "ballad" have been written. These include Fauré's "Ballade", op. 19, which was written in 1881, and Charles Koechlin's "Ballade" for piano and orchestra, op. 50, written between 1911–1919. Interestingly enough, Koechlin happened to be a student of Fauré. This work also exists as a solo work for piano.

The First Gun is Fired

"The First Gun is Fired: May God Protect the Right" was the first song written specifically for the American Civil War. It was first published and distributed three days after the Battle of Fort Sumter. George F. Root, who wrote it the day before it first appeared in print, is said to have produced the most songs of anyone about the war, over thirty in total.
"The First Gun is Fired" was first performed in public at a patriotic rally in Metropolitan Hall in Chicago, Illinois, by two well-known singers of the day, the Lombard Brothers. Root distributed copies of the sheet music to the audience. The song caught on with the public and became one of the most popular tunes of the Civil War.
Lyrics.
1.<br>
The first gun is fired!<br>
May God protect the right!<br>
Let the freeborn sons of the North arise<br>
In power’s avenging night;<br>
Shall the glorious Union our father’s have made,<br>
By ruthless hands be sunder’d,<br>
And we of freedom sacred rights<br>
By trait’rous foes be plunder’d?
Chorus—Arise! arise! arise!<br>
And gird ye for the fight,<br>
And let our watchword ever be,<br>
“May God protect the right!”
2.<br>
The first gun is fired!<br>
Its echoes thrill the land,<br>
And the bounding hearts of the patriot throng,<br>
Now firmly take their stand;<br>
We will bow no more to the tyrant few,<br>
Who scorn our long forbearing,<br>
But with Columbia’s stars and stripes<br>
We’ll quench their trait’rous daring.

Wiremu Parata

Wiremu Parata Te Kakakura, also known as Wi Parata ( 1830s – 29 September 1906) was a New Zealand politician of Māori and Pākehā descent. During the 1870s he was a member of the House of Representatives and a Minister of the Crown.
Early years, and farming.
Parata was the son of Metapere Waipunahau, a Māori woman of high status, and George Stubbs, a whaler and trader from the United States. His grandfather Te Rangi Hīroa and his great-uncle Te Pēhi Kupe were leading rangatira amongst the Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Toa iwi who had settled along the Kapiti Coast.
After Stubbs drowned in a boating accident off Kapiti Island in 1838, Parata and his brother were taken by their mother to the pā at Kenakena, where he grew up. 
In 1852, he married his second wife, Unaiki; nothing is known of his first marriage. Parata and Unaiki are thought to have had eleven children.
In the late 1860s, Parata became a farmer, and owned about 1,600 sheep by the mid-1870s. He was, by then, relatively wealthy, and owned the largest farm in the area of Waikanae, a town which was initially named after him ("Parata Township"). He hosted the Waikanae Hack Racing Club on his land, a practice subsequently maintained by his son and grandson until 1914.
Political career.
Parata entered politics in the 1860s. In 1871, he was elected to Parliament as the member for the Western Maori constituency, defeating the incumbent Mete Paetahi. He remained the sitting MP for the duration of the 5th New Zealand Parliament.
In December 1872, Parata became just the second Māori to be appointed to the Executive Council (thus becoming a Minister of the Crown) joining Wi Katene who had been appointed just a month earlier.
Parata is described by the "Dictionary of New Zealand Biography" as having been "an astute politician and skilled orator and debater". In Parliament, he expressed the view that Pākehā were not qualified to make informed decisions regarding Māori, and pressed for Māori and Pākehā MPs to work together on laws for the benefit of both peoples. He also called for the appointment of a commission to look into Māori grievances related to land confiscations.
"Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington" (1877).
Parata is perhaps best remembered for the court case which bears his name. In 1877, he took Octavius Hadfield, the Bishop of Wellington, to the Supreme Court, over a breach of oral contract between the Anglican Church and the Ngati Toa, and a breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Ngati Toa had provided land to the church in 1848 in exchange for a promise that a school for young Ngati Toa people would be built by the church. No school was built, and, in 1850, the church obtained a Crown grant to the land, without the consent of the iwi. The case ("Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington") was a failure for Parata; Chief Justice James Prendergast ruled that the Treaty of Waitangi was a "simply nullity", having been signed by "primitive barbarians". The ruling had far-reaching consequences, as it was invoked as precedent during subsequent claims brought for breaches of the Treaty, well into the twentieth century.
Later life.
In the late 1870s, Parata openly supported pacifist leader Te Whiti-o-Rongomai, providing him and his Parihaka community with financial support. 
On 29 September 1906, Parata died at Waikanae from injuries sustained after falling from a horse.

<doc id="19774761" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774761" title="Ælfgifu of York">
Ælfgifu of York

Ælfgifu of York (fl. c. 970 – 1002) was the first wife of Æthelred the Unready (r. 968–1016), by whom she bore many offspring, including Edmund Ironside. It is most probable that she was a daughter of Thored, Earl of southern Northumbria.
Identity and background.
Her name and paternity do not surface in the sources until sometime after the Conquest. The first to offer any information at all, Sulcard of Westminster ("fl". 1080s), merely describes her as being “of very noble English stock” ("ex nobilioribus Anglis"), without naming her, while in the early 12th century, William of Malmesbury has nothing to report. All primary evidence comes from two Anglo-Norman historians. John of Worcester, in a chronicle which is thought to rely on earlier material compiled "c". 1100, tells that Æthelred's first wife was Ælfgifu, daughter of the nobleman Æthelberht ("comes Agelberhtus") and the mother of Edmund, Æthelstan, Eadwig and Eadgyth. Writing in the 1150s, Ailred of Rievaulx had reason to identify Æthelred's first wife as a daughter of earl ("comes") Thored and the mother of Edmund, though he supplies no name. Ailred had been seneschal at the court of King David I of Scotland (r. 1124–53), whose mother Margaret descended from King Æthelred and his first wife. Although his testimony is late, his proximity to the royal family may have given him access to genuine information.
Problem of fatherhood.
These two accounts are irreconcilable at the point of ascribing two different fathers to Æthelred's first wife (in both cases, Edmund's mother). One way out of it would be to assume the existence of two different wives before the arrival of Queen Emma, Æthelred's Norman wife, although this interpretation presents difficulties of its own, especially as the sources envisage a single woman. Historians generally favour the view that John of Worcester was in error about the father's name, as Æthelberht's very existence is under suspicion: if Latin "comes" is to be interpreted as a gloss on the office of ealdorman, only two doubtful references to one or two "duces" (ealdormen) of this name can be put forward that would fit the description. All in all, the combined evidence suggests that Æthelred's first wife was Ælfgifu, the daughter of Earl Thored. This magnate is likely to have been the Thored who was a son of Gunnar and earl of (southern) Northumbria.
Marriage and offspring.
Based largely on the careers of her sons, Ælfgifu's marriage has been dated approximately to the (mid-)980s. Considering Thored's authority as earl of York and apparently, the tenure of that office without royal appointment, the union would have signified an important step for the West-Saxon royal family by which it secured a foothold in the north. Such a politically weighty union would help explain the close connections maintained by Ælfgifu's eldest sons Edmund and Æthelstan with noble families based in the northern Danelaw.
The marriage produced six sons, all of whom were named after Æthelred's predecessors, and an unknown number of daughters. The eldest sons Æthelstan, Ecgberht, Eadred and Edmund first attest charters in 993, while the younger sons Eadwig and Edgar first make an appearance in them in 997 and 1001 respectively. Some of these sons seem to have spent part of their childhood in fosterage elsewhere, possibly with Æthelred's mother Ælfthryth.
Out of Ælfgifu's six sons, only Edmund Ironside outlived his father and became king. In 1016 he suffered several defeats against Cnut and in October they agreed to share the kingdom, but Edmund died within six weeks and Cnut became king of all England. Æthelred gave three of his daughters in marriage to ealdormen, presumably in order to secure the loyalties of his nobles and so to consolidate a defence system against Viking attacks.
Life and death.
Unlike her mother-in-law, Ælfthryth, Ælfgifu was not anointed queen and never signed charters. She did, however, make at least some impression on the contemporary record. In a will issued between 975/980 and 987, the thegn Beorhtric and his wife bequeathed to their “lady” ("hlæfdige") an armlet worth 30 gold mancuses and a stallion, calling upon her authority to oversee the implementation of the arrangements set out by will. In a will of later date (AD 990 x 1001), in which she is addressed as “my lady” ("mire hlæfdian"), the noblewoman Æthelgifu promised a bequest of 30 mancuses of gold. Just as little is known of Ælfgifu's life, so the precise date and circumstances of her death cannot be recovered. In any event, she appears to have died by 1002, possibly in childbirth, when Æthelred took to wife Emma, daughter of Count Richard of Rouen, who received or adopted her predecessor's Anglo-Saxon name, Ælfgifu.

<doc id="19774773" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774773" title="History of the Green Party of England and Wales">
History of the Green Party of England and Wales

The Green Party of England and Wales has its roots in the PEOPLE party started in Coventry in 1972/3 by four professional friends (Michael Benfield, Freda Sanders, Tony & Lesley Whittaker). It then changed its name to the more descriptive Ecology Party in 1975, to the Green Party ten years later. In the 1990s, the Scottish and Northern Ireland wings of the Green Party in the United Kingdom decided to separate amicably from the party in England and Wales, to form the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in Northern Ireland. The Wales Green Party became an autonomous regional party and remained within the new Green Party of England and Wales.
1990 to 1997.
In 1991 Green Party spokesman and TV sports presenter David Icke created considerable embarrassment for the Party when he revealed his extreme spiritual beliefs, announcing that he believed himself to be "a son of God", that Britain was about to suffer apocalyptic earthquakes and tidal waves and that Armageddon was approaching. Many believe that he suffered from some form of mental illness that led to his espousal of such theories. He would subsequently be forced to leave the Party.
Internal divisions over the direction of the party in the early 1990s also meant that the Green Party fell out of the limelight and failed to maintain its electoral momentum. In 1991, attempts to streamline the Party Constitution were proposed by a group called 'Green 2000', who wanted to 'modernise' the Party and make it into an organised electoral force that could become the ruling party in the UK by the year 2000. After the Green 2000 Constitution was adopted, a new Executive came into force to oversee the day-to-day business of the Party. Many Green 2000 members were elected to the new Executive in 1991 but, by 1992, only two remained, with the others resigning or being recalled and forced to quit. These internal constitutional wranglings, and negative public statements released by supporters of both Green 2000 and decentralists who ran the recall campaigns, seriously hampered preparations for the 1992 General Election, in which 253 Green candidates received 1.3% of the vote. Sara Parkin and Jonathon Porritt left active involvement with the party, depriving it of two of its most charismatic and ambitious figures.
The early and mid-1990s were difficult for the Greens, because of Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, the recession of 1992-3 and the squeeze caused by the rising popularity of New Labour. Nevertheless, the party gained a handful of local councillors in Stroud and Oxford.
In the 1992 General Election, Cynog Dafis was elected on a Plaid Cymru–Wales Green Party ticket, gaining Ceredigion and Pembroke North from the Liberal Democrats. This made him the first Green representative in the House of Commons. The electoral agreement that enabled this broke down by 1995.
1997 to 2009.
The election of a Labour government in 1997 paradoxically created new opportunities and focus for the Green Party. New democratic institutions were created that offered electoral possibilities for the Greens, such as the London Assembly and Welsh Assembly (and for the independent Scottish Green Party, the Scottish Parliament) all of which use some form of proportional representation, allowing smaller parties the chance of gaining representation. Labour also changed European Parliamentary elections to a form of proportional representation.
Combined with gradual council gains, the party has quietly gained successes.
In the 1999 European elections, two Greens were elected Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), Dr Caroline Lucas (South East England) and Jean Lambert (London). They retained their seats in the 2004 European elections, despite a reduction in number of seats available. Overall, the Party gained 1,033,093 votes in the 2004 European election.
However the Greens have not yet managed to breakthrough into other European electoral regions or the Welsh Assembly.
Three Greens were elected to the first London Assembly. It currently has two Green Party members out of 25. These are Cllr. Darren Johnson AM, and Cllr. Jenny Jones AM.
The Green Party achieved its highest ever UK General Election result in the 2005 General Election with a total of 281,780 votes. During the 2005 General Election, Cllr. Keith Taylor received 22% in Brighton Pavilion.
The Party has 116 local councillors after a gain of 5 councillors during the 2008 local elections. The Greens have significant representation on Brighton & Hove City Council, Lancaster City Council, Norwich, Lewisham, Oxford City Council, Oxfordshire County Council, Kirklees Council and Stroud District Council. The Green Party are the official opposition on Norwich City Council, form part of the ruling coalition that controls Lancaster City Council alongside the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and Castle Morpeth Council as part of an all party administration.
In this period, the Green Party of England and Wales had representation in the House of Lords, the (unelected) upper chamber of Parliament: in the person of Lord Beaumont of Whitley, who died in 2008.
According to MORI, Green issues are currently rated as importantly as during the Green Party's last high point in the late 1980s. The party currently has record local candidate numbers and high electoral support.
The party has held its first ever leadership election in September 2008. Caroline Lucas was elected to the position of Leader, and Adrian Ramsay to the position of Deputy Leader.
Since 2010.
The Green Party fielded more than 300 candidates for the 2010 general election. Party leader Caroline Lucas became the first Green candidate to gain a seat in Westminster, after being elected MP for Brighton Pavilion by a margin of 1,252 votes. The following week 600 new members had joined the Green Party bringing total membership to over 11,000. In previous years 600 new members was high for a whole year.

Cultural Research

Cultural Research is a work of academic research, edited by the Anglo-Afghan writer Tahir Shah.
As the world shrinks in terms of accessibility, cultures are impinging upon one another with increasing force. Much of the time the result is a breakdown of traditions, and an upsurge of homogenized culture. In Cultural Research, Tahir Shah brings together a series of papers, some by himself, others by a number of noted academics and writers on cultural and inter-cultural issues. The papers include a piece about the Ainu of Japan, whose society has been all but consumed by Japanese society, and another about Nusristan, the formerly pagan area of Afghanistan. There are monographs too by General Sir John Glubb on his years with the Arabs, and another by Dr. Peter Brent on the West's fascination with Arab culture. There are two pieces about West Africa: a treatise on Sokodae, a West African dance, and a second looking at the Secret Societies of Sierra Leone. Other articles shed light on the Moriscos of post-Islamic Spain, and Macumba, a Brazilian form of religious activity related to West African belief system.
The collection was published under the auspices of the Institute for Cultural Research.

Canal basin

A canal basin is (particularly in the United Kingdom) an expanse of waterway alongside or at the end of a canal, and wider than the canal, constructed to allow boats to moor or unload cargo without impeding the progress of other traffic, and to allow room for turning, thus serving as a winding hole. For inland waterways, a basin may be thought of as a land-locked harbour.
A basin was often associated with wharves around its perimeter, to support commercial users. In modern times, canal basins are more usually used to moor residential and recreational narrowboats.

Plot (graphics)

A plot is a graphical technique for representing a data set, usually as a graph showing the relationship between two or more variables. The plot can be drawn by hand or by a mechanical or electronic plotter. Graphs are a visual representation of the relationship between variables, very useful for humans who can quickly derive an understanding which would not come from lists of values. Graphs can also be used to read off the value of an unknown variable plotted as a function of a known one. Graphs of functions are used in mathematics, sciences, engineering, technology, finance, and other areas.
Overview.
Plots play an important role in statistics and data analysis. The procedures here can broadly be split into two parts: quantitative and graphical. Quantitative techniques are the set of statistical procedures that yield numeric or tabular output. Examples of quantitative techniques include:
These and similar techniques are all valuable and are mainstream in terms of classical analysis. There are also many statistical tools generally referred to as graphical techniques. These include:
Graphical procedures such as plots are a short path to gaining insight into a data set in terms of testing assumptions, model selection, model validation, estimator selection, relationship identification, factor effect determination, outlier detection. Statistical graphics give insight into aspects of the underlying structure of the data.
Graphs can also be used to solve some mathematical equations, typically by finding where two plots intersect.
Examples.
Types of graphs and their uses vary very widely. A few typical examples are:

Grand Pro Wrestling

Grand Pro Wrestling (formerly Garage Pro Wrestling) or GPW is a British professional wrestling promotion based in the North West of England. The promotion was established up by former British wrestler - "The Middleman" Lee Butler - in February 2003. However, in August 2004, Butler handed over the reins of the promotion to his senior trainees and retired from wrestling. Since January 2005 GPW has been run by British wrestler Johnnie Brannigan. However, the name 'Richard Noble' was used as the public facing name up until Brannigan went public with his role in the company in April 2012.
Overview.
The promotion runs shows in the North West of England, mainly in the Greater Manchester area at The Rose Club (formerly known as The Monaco Ballroom) in Hindley Wigan running between 8 and 10 times a year. 
It has developed a large, passionate fan base and gained a reputation for one of the best story telling wrestling companies on the independent scene. Its shows are known for their addictive and progressive storylines, strong characters, hard hits, high flying, comedy and a strong connection between their audience and the characters.
GPW has established several flagship shows that it has become known for, such as: Crazy Cruiser-8 (one night 8-man tournament show), Only The Strong Survive (survival themed show) A Few Good Men (a Royal Rumble themed show), Friday Night Thriller, promoted as an "unpredictable night of wrestling" and Back With A Bang, the traditional show to start a new year.
GPW is credited with having started off many of today's British and American independent wrestlers careers. These names include: Bubblegum, El Ligero, Claudio Castagnoli, Joey Hayes, "Dangerous" Damon Leigh, Heresy, "Juice" CJ Banks, Dylan Roberts, Danny Hope, JC Thunder, Cyanide, Jack Gallagher, William Gáylord, Ricky J. McKenzie, L.A Austin, Ste "Bin" Man and many more.
History.
The promotion's first show was in July 2003, GPW: "Defection" held at the Monaco Ballroom, Wigan. Wrestlers on that night who are still active on the roster are Johnnie "Heresy" Brannigan, "Dangerous" Damon Leigh and Joey Hayes.
Other memorable shows include GPW: "Nemesis" which saw a main event tag team tables match between Lee Butler & Heresy vs. The Young Offenders ("Dangerous" Damon Leigh & Joey Hayes). The match featured Heresy and Damon Leigh in a 30ft balcony stunt. 
During GPW: "Last Orders At The Legion" in January 2005 there was a well documented riot, at the now demolished venue in Leigh, Greater Manchester. The riots in the audience were very real and occurred when Alex Shane stole the British Title from then champion Damon Leigh. Local papers featured the events as headline news.
In July 2005, GPW: "Saturday Night Showdown" saw JC Thunder vs. El Ligero in main event hardcore match. The match was quite possibly the most controversial in British wrestling history and resulted in the venue banning all professional wrestling from the Greater Manchester area. However, the following year they were allowed to return.
In April 2006, GPW promoted "A Few Good Men" one of the only 30 Man Rumbles in the UK at that time. 
May 2007 GPW promoted Europe's first ever Survivor Series dedicated show. 
July 2008 saw its 5th Anniversary show; GPW: "V". In October 2008, GPW became the only European company to feature a Torneo Cibernetico a match that has gone onto be a staple part of the GPW shows.
In August 2010, GPW re-branded as Grand Pro Wrestling. 
In June 2011 at "Heroes & Villains", GPW presented its 500th match between Zach Diamond and Jack Gallagher for the British Title.
In April 2012, GPW wrestler, Dom Travis aka Kastor LeVay died. His last official match was for GPW at "Battlefield" May 2011 but he also made appearances in November (pre-taped videeo) and December 2011 (run-in during Heresy v Voodoo).
January 2013 saw the start of the company's 10th Year Celebrations.
Crazy Cruiser-8 Tournament.
The Crazy Cruiser-8 is an eight-man one night tournament, and one of the shows GPW has become synonymous with. The eight entrants into the tournament are junior heavyweights or are considered a cruiserweight. Heavyweights are not permitted entry into the tournament. Qualifying matches are contested months prior to the tournament either in traditional one on one matches, 4-ways, 3-ways or in a "Last Chance Saloon Battle Royal". Byes passed the preliminaries have been given in the past to established foreign entrants, eligible reigning Champions and "The Fans Choice".
The eventual winner of the tournament would have not only been successful in the preliminaries, but have won three times in a row on the night of the tournament itself. The winner does not defend his title the following year.
2006.
The first CC-8 tournament was 3 November 2006 and the final 8 men were:
The eventual winner was Bubblegum after he defeated Joseph Hayes in the final.
2008.
The second Crazy Cruiser tournament was known as CC-08 and competed on 2 May 2008. The final 8 men were:
Juice was the eventual winner after defeating Chris Echo in the final.
2009.
The third Crazy Cruiser tournament was competed on 13 November 2009 and saw new rules on qualifying. 2 top seeds were selected as automatic qualifiers (Joey Hayes & Bubblegum). Other qualifiers were decided through a first ever Fan's Choice, a 4-Way Qualifier, The Last Chance Battle Royal and the return of the International Entrant. The final 8 men were:
Joey Hayes was the eventual winner after defeating CC8 2008 Champion, Juice in the final.
GPW Training School.
Established when the promotion first started in 2003, the training school has turned out some of the best wrestlers on the European circuit today. 
The training facility is based in the heart of Manchester with regular classes. Head trainers are Johnnie "Heresy" Brannigan and Damon Leigh. However, other graduates and established British wrestlers are also involved in the development of trainees.

Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury

Saint Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury (died 944) was the first wife of Edmund I (r. 939–946), by whom she bore two future kings, Eadwig (r. 955–959) and Edgar (r. 959–975). Like her mother Wynflæd, she had a close and special if unknown connection with the royal nunnery of Shaftesbury (Dorset), founded by King Alfred, where she was buried and soon revered as a saint. According to a pre-Conquest tradition from Winchester, her feast day is 18 May.
Family background.
Her mother appears to have been an associate of Shaftesbury Abbey called Wynflæd (also Wynnflæd). The vital clue comes from a charter of King Edgar, in which he confirmed the grant of an estate at "Uppidelen" (Piddletrenthide, Dorset) made by his grandmother ("ava") Wynflæd to Shaftesbury"." She may well be the nun or vowess ("religiosa femina") of this name in a charter dated 942 and preserved in the abbey's chartulary. It records that she received and retrieved from King Edmund a handful of estates in Dorset, namely Cheselbourne and Winterbourne Tomson, which somehow ended up in the possession of the community.
Since no father or siblings are known, further speculation on Ælfgifu's background has largely depended on the identity of her mother, whose relatively uncommon name has invited further guesswork. H. P. R. Finberg suggests that she was the Wynflæd who drew up a will, supposedly sometime in the mid-10th century, after Ælfgifu's death. This lady held many estates scattered across Wessex (in Somerset, Wiltshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, and Hampshire) and was well connected with the nunneries at Wilton and Shaftesbury, both of which were royal foundations. On that basis, a number of relatives have been proposed for Ælfgifu, including a sister called Æthelflæd, a brother called Eadmær, and a grandmother called Brihtwyn.
There is, however, no consensus among scholars about Finberg's suggestion. Simon Keynes and Gale R. Owen object that there is no sign of royal relatives or connections in Wynflæd's will and Finberg's assumptions about Ælfgifu's family therefore stand on shaky ground. Andrew Wareham is less troubled about this and suggests that different kinship strategies may account for it. Much of the issue of identification also seems to hang on the number of years by which Wynflæd can plausibly have outlived her daughter. In this light, it is significant that on palaeographical grounds, David Dumville has rejected the conventional date of "c". 950 for the will, which he considers “speculative and too early” (and that one Wynflæd was still alive in 967).
Married life.
The sources do not record the date of Ælfgifu's marriage to Edmund. The eldest son Eadwig, who had barely reached majority on his accession in 955, may have been born around 940, which gives us only a very rough "terminus ante quem" for the betrothal. Although as the mother of two future kings, Ælfgifu proved to be an important royal bed companion, there is no strictly contemporary evidence that she was ever consecrated as queen. Likewise, her formal position at court appears to have been relatively insignificant, overshadowed as it was by the queen mother Eadgifu of Kent. In the single extant document witnessed by her, a Kentish charter datable between 942 and 944, she subscribes as the king's concubine ("concubina regis"), with a place assigned to her between the bishops and ealdormen. By comparison, Eadgifu subscribes higher up in the witness list as "mater regis", after her sons Edmund and Eadred but before the archbishops and bishops"." It is only towards the end of the 10th century that Æthelweard the Chronicler styles her queen ("regina"), but this may be a retrospective honour at a time when her cult was well established at Shaftesbury.
Much of Ælfgifu's claim to fame derives from her association with Shaftesbury. Her patronage of the community is suggested by a charter of King Æthelred, dated 984, according to which the abbey exchanged with King Edmund the large estate at Tisbury (Wiltshire) for "Butticanlea" (unidentified). Ælfgifu received it from her husband and intended to bequeath it back to the nunnery, but such had not yet come to pass (her son Eadwig demanded that "Butticanlea" was returned to the royal family first).
Ælfgifu predeceased her husband in 944. In the early 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that she suffered from an illness during the last few years of her life, but there may have been some confusion with details of Æthelgifu's life as recorded in a forged foundation charter of the late 11th or 12th century (see below). Her body was buried and enshrined at the nunnery.
Sainthood.
Ælfgifu was venerated as a saint soon after her burial at Shaftesbury. Æthelweard reports that many miracles had taken place at her tomb up to his day, and these were apparently attracting some local attention. Lantfred of Winchester, who wrote in the 970's and so can be called the earliest known witness of her cult, tells of a young man from Collingbourne (possibly Collingbourne Kingston, Wiltshire), who in the hope of being cured of blindness travelled to Shaftesbury and kept vigil. What led him there was the reputation of “the venerable St Ælfgifu […] at whose tomb many bodies of sick person receive medication through the omnipotence of God”. Despite the new prominence of Edward the Martyr as a saint interred at Shaftesbury, her cult continued to flourish in later Anglo-Saxon England, as evidenced by her inclusion in a list of saints' resting places, at least 8 pre-Conquest calendars and 3 or 4 litanies from Winchester.
Ælfgifu is styled a saint ("Sancte Ælfgife") in the D-text of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" (mid-11th century) at the point where it specifies Eadwig's and Edgar's royal parentage. Her cult may have been fostered and used to enhance the status of the royal lineage, more narrowly that of her descendants. Lantfred attributes her healing power both to her own merits and those of her son Edgar. It may have been due to her association that in 979 the supposed body of her murdered grandson Edward the Martyr was exhumed and in a spectacular ceremony, received at the nunnery of Shaftesbury, under the supervision of ealdorman Ælfhere.
Ælfgifu's fame at Shaftesbury seems to have eclipsed that of its first abbess, King Alfred's daughter Æthelgifu, so much so perhaps that William of Malmesbury wrote contradictory reports on the abbey's early history. In the "Gesta regum", he correctly identifies the first abbess as Alfred's daughter, following Asser, although he gives her the name of Ælfgifu ("Elfgiva"), while in his "Gesta pontificum", he credits Edmund's wife Ælfgifu with the foundation. Either William encountered conflicting information, or he meant to say that Ælfgifu refounded the nunnery. In any event, William would have had access to local traditions at Shaftesbury, since he probably wrote a now lost metrical "Life" for the community, a fragment of which he included in his "Gesta pontificum":

Jeunesse Etudiante Chrétienne

Jeunesse Etudiante Chrétienne, more commonly called the JEC, is a worldwide group of young Christian students. The movement also goes by the name YCS (Young Christian Students) in English or JEC (Juventud Estudiantil Catolica) in Spanish.
History.
Created 1929 in France, as part of the Catholic social movement, the JEC was formed by students from the ACJF (Association Catholique de la Jeunesse Française) wishing to minister to other catholic students. The movement organised specialist branches. In 1935 the JEC, opposed Nazism and grew rapidly, in 1936, their first national convention had 4000 participants.
JEC movement grew in the spirit of the Specialized Catholic Action movements that were inspired by Joseph Cardijn (the founder of the Young Christian Workers) with the methodology of See-Judge-Act.
The JEC was a significant operator in the French resistance during WWII and continued to play a role in French political life until the 1960s. JEC members included numerous members of the resistance, politicians, media and university people, among them: Jacques Delors, Pascal Lamy, Joseph Fontanet, Gilbert Dru, Pierre Alviset, René Rémond, André de Péretti, Patrick Viveret, Pierre Rosanvallon, Geneviève Latreille, Antoine Spire, Jean-Pierre Sueur, Georges Montaron, Christophe Hondelatte, Claude-François Jullien, Roger-Henri Guerrand, Renaud Sainsaulieu, Jean-Marie Vincent, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and Jacques Bugnicourt.
In the 1960s the JEC denounced torture and the French government's fighting against Algerian independence, this caused tensions with the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in France. As a result, in 1965, the Church removed its mandate from the association. This engagement with the church lead to schism within the JEC, which lasted until the reconstruction in the 1980s.
Today.
Today the JEC continues its evangelistic mission amongst its members. Their objectives are to make students more aware of their social responsibilities and to help them maintain their faith. The JEC encourages its members to work for social change in their own environment.
The JEC has a General Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC) of the United Nations, and an Operational Status with UNESCO in 1998.
JEC is recognized by the Holy See and since the World Council of Kampala in 2007, has the private juridical statute according to the Canon Law 298-311 and 321-329.

1946 PGA Championship

The 1946 PGA Championship was the 28th PGA Championship, held August 19–25 at Portland Golf Club outside Portland, Oregon. Ben Hogan won the match play championship, 6 & 4 over Ed Oliver in the final; the winner's share was $3,500 and the runner-up's was $1,500.
Hogan was three down after the first 18 holes in the morning, then rebounded in the afternoon. In the semifinals, Hogan defeated Jimmy Demaret 10 & 9 and Oliver beat Jug McSpaden 6 & 5. Oliver defeated defending champion Byron Nelson 1 up in the quarterfinals.
For Hogan, age 34, it was the first of his nine major titles. He won again in 1948, but following his near-fatal auto accident in early 1949, his debilitated condition did not agree with the grueling five-day schedule of 36 holes per day in summer heat. Hogan did not enter the PGA Championship again until 1960, its third year as a 72-hole stroke play event, at 18 holes per day.
In the quarterfinals, defending champion Byron Nelson bogeyed the final hole and lost 1 down to Oliver; it was Nelson's final appearance at the PGA Championship. The medalist for the stroke-play qualifying portion was Jim Ferrier, which included a 29 on the front nine of the second round, a record for a PGA event. He won the PGA Championship title the following year in 1947.
The Portland Golf Club hosted the Portland Open on the PGA Tour the previous two years; Sam Snead won in 1944 and Hogan in 1945. It also hosted the Ryder Cup in 1947, won by the U.S. team captained by Hogan.
This was the first "full field" at the PGA Championship since 1941, with a match play bracket of 64 competitors. Due to World War II, it had been reduced to 32 for 1942, 1944, and 1945, and not played in 1943.

It marked the first time the PGA Championship returned to a venue; Oakmont had hosted in 1922 (at the time, it had also hosted two U.S. Opens and three U.S. Amateurs). It was the third and final win for Snead in the PGA Championship, and the sixth of his seven major titles. At age 39, he was the oldest at the time to win the PGA Championship, passing his old record of two years earlier. Burkemo won the title in 1953 and was runner-up again in 1954.
Defending champion Chandler Harper lost in the first round to Jim Turnesa in a match that went to 23 holes. Turnesa, the runner-up to Snead back in 1942, won the title following year in 1952, and displaced Snead as the oldest champion by a few months.
Snead's win was the last by a former champion for twenty years, until Jack Nicklaus won his second PGA Championship in 1971.
Claude Harmon, Lloyd Mangrum, and Pete Cooper tied for the lowest score in the stroke play qualifier at 142 (−2). Harmon won the $250 medalist prize on the third hole of a sudden-death playoff.
The British Open in 1951 was held in the first week of July in Northern Ireland. Its mandatory two-day qualifier was held the same days as the PGA's semifinals and finals, which prevented participation in both events.

The match play format at the PGA Championship in 1951 called for 12 rounds (216 holes) in seven days:

Henry Hoyle Howorth

Sir Henry Hoyle Howorth KCIE FRS (1 July 1842 – 15 July 1923) was a British Conservative politician, barrister and amateur historian and geologist.
He was born in Lisbon, Portugal, the son of Henry Howorth, a merchant in that city. He was educated at Rossall School before studying law. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1867, and practised on the Northern Circuit. He was also the maternal great uncle of anthropologist Sir Edmund Ronald Leach.
He was a Unionist in politics, and was elected as Conservative member of parliament for Salford South in 1886. He was re-elected in 1892 and 1895 before retiring from the Commons at the 1900 general election.
Apart from the law and politics, Howorth was deeply interested in archaeology, history, numismatics and ethnography. He was a prolific writer, contributing articles to a number of journals.
In 1892 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire in recognition of his works on the history and ethnography of Asia. In 1893 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, against considerable opposition as he lacked any formal scientific education. He subsequently became Honorary Librarian of Chetham's College and a Trustee of the British Museum. He was also a Member of the Chetham Society, serving as a Member of Council from 1877 until 1900.
Howorth was a controversialist, frequently airing his opinions on the letters page of "The Times", sometimes under the pseudonym "A Manchester Conservative". He married Katherine Brierley in 1869 and they had three sons. She predeceased him in 1921. Sir Henry Howorth died in July 1923 aged 81, and was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.

1952 PGA Championship

The 1952 PGA Championship was the 34th PGA Championship, held June 18–25 at Big Spring Country Club in Louisville, Kentucky. Jim Turnesa won the match play championship, 1 up over Chick Harbert in the Wednesday final; the winner's share was $3,500 and the runner-up's was $1,500.
It was Turnesa's only major title; he had lost the final in 1942 to Sam Snead. It was the second loss for Harbert in the final, he lost to Jim Ferrier in 1947, but won the title in his third finals appearance in 1954. Turnesa did not lead through the first 35 holes, but won on the final green when Harbert bogeyed. Turnesa displaced Snead as the oldest PGA champion to date, at 39 years and six months. He was later passed by Jerry Barber at 45 in 1961 and Julius Boros in 1968 at age 48.
Battling an ailing back, defending champion Snead lost in the first round to Lew Worsham, who had defeated him in a playoff five years earlier at the 1947 U.S. Open. Heavy rains washed out play on Saturday and the completion of the third round was delayed until Sunday, and very hot temperatures endured through the final rounds.
The U.S. Open was played the preceding week, in Dallas, Texas, won by Boros. He was not technically eligible to play in the PGA Championship, because the rules at the time stated that eligibility was after five years of PGA membership and Boros only had three. Following his win at the U.S. Open, Boros was invited to play by the PGA executive committee, but sensing resentment and dissension among some of the other participants, he withdrew prior to his start time of the two-day qualifier on Wednesday.
E.J. "Dutch" Harrison was the medalist in the stroke-play qualifying with a 136 (−8) to win $250, but lost in the first round to Marty Furgol.
Format.
The match play format at the PGA Championship in 1952 called for 12 rounds (216 holes) in seven days:
Heavy rains on Saturday delayed the third round's completion until Sunday; the final was played on Wednesday, June 25.

Trametes gibbosa

Trametes gibbosa, commonly known as the 'lumpy bracket', is a polypore mushroom that causes a white rot. It is found on beech stumps and the dead wood of other hardwood species. Fruit bodies are 8–15 cm in diameter and semicircular in shape. The upper surface is usually gray or white, but may be greenish in older specimens due to algal growth. Elongated pores are located on the under-surface. The fruiting bodies are frequently attacked by boring beetle larvae.

Conflict with British Open.
The Open Championship in Carnoustie, Scotland, was held July 8–10. Its mandatory 36-hole qualifier was played the two days before the first round, the same days as the semifinals and final at the PGA Championship in Michigan.
Ben Hogan, the reigning Masters and U.S. Open champion, traveled to Britain for the only time to qualify for the Open. He won the Claret Jug by four strokes and set the course record at Carnoustie during the final round. First prize was a modest £500 ($1,400), less than one-third of the PGA's. Hogan won the PGA Championship in 1946 and 1948, then did not enter for over a decade. After his near-fatal automobile accident in early 1949, his battered legs could not endure the arduous double-round schedule for five consecutive days. He played in three of the events in the 1960s, after the change of format to stroke play.
The concept of the modern grand slam and professional major championships were not firmly established in 1953, as evidenced by the schedule conflict in early July. The PGA Championship moved two weeks later in 1954 to avoid this conflict, but during the 1960s, the two majors were played in consecutive weeks in July on five occasions. The PGA Championship was first played in August in 1965, and moved permanently in 1969, except for 1971 when it was played in Florida in February.

1956 PGA Championship

The 1956 PGA Championship was the 38th edition of the professional golf competition, held at Blue Hill Country Club in Canton, Massachusetts, a suburb southwest of Boston. Jack Burke, Jr. won his second major championship of 1956, a 3 & 2 victory over Ted Kroll; Burke won the Masters in April. It was the penultimate PGA Championship as a match play competition; stroke play was introduced two years later in 1958. This was the tenth and final year the PGA Championship was scheduled for a Tuesday finish.
Defending champion Doug Ford was stopped in the third round by 1953 champion Walter Burkemo, 5 & 3. 
Burke was the second to win the Masters and PGA Championship in the same calendar year, following Sam Snead in 1949. Through 2013, it has only been accomplished four times, with the latter two by Jack Nicklaus in 1963 and 1975.
Format.
The match play format at the PGA Championship was modified in 1956 and called for 9 rounds (162 holes) in five days, Friday through Tuesday. Previously, a two-day stroke play qualifying segment (36 holes) on Wednesday and Thursday preceded the match play competition to narrow the field to 64 competitors. This year, 128 players were entered in the single-elimination bracket. The first five rounds were 18-hole matches, contested in the morning and afternoon of the first three days, which reduced the field to four players. The semifinals and finals were 36-hole matches played on the final two days, Monday and Tuesday.

Burger Chef murders

"Burger Chef murders" is a phrase used to describe a series of events that began at a Burger Chef restaurant in Speedway, Indiana on the night of Friday, November 17, 1978.
Suspected robbery and homicides.
Just after 11:00 PM on Friday, November 17, 1978, four young employees of a Speedway, Indiana, Burger Chef restaurant located at 5725 Crawfordsville Road disappeared. They were kidnapped during what was believed to be a botched robbery. The murdered bodies of Jayne Friedt, 20; Daniel Davis, 16; Mark Flemmonds, 16; and Ruth Ellen Shelton, 18, were found that Sunday afternoon over away in the rural woods of Johnson County, Indiana. Both Davis and Shelton had been shot execution-style numerous times. Friedt had been stabbed twice in the chest. The handle of the knife had broken off and was missing; the blade was later recovered during an autopsy. Flemmonds had suffered a blunt force head injury, possibly from running into a tree while trying to escape. It was later determined that he had been bludgeoned prior to his death.
Possible suspects.
According to a 16-year-old eyewitness, two suspicious men were in a car outside the Burger Chef just before closing on Friday night. Both were white and in their thirties. One man had a beard and the other was clean-shaven with light colored hair.
Unsolved.
The case was never solved, despite thousands of hours of investigation and a Burger Chef offer of $25,000 for information that could lead to its resolution.

Mike Gravier (born September 27, 1960) is an American football coach and former player in the United States. He played college football at Grand Valley State University and is currently an assistant coach at Valparaiso University. Gravier is known for significant success as a coach with upstart Malone, having successfully led the team to significant victories early in the history of the program at a time when other peer programs were well-established, including a NAIA playoff appearance in the program's third year.
Coaching career.
Malone.
Gravier was the second head football coach for the Malone College Pioneers located in Canton, Ohio and he held that position for four seasons, from 1995 until 1998. His career coaching record at Malone was 30 wins, 12 losses, and 1 ties. This ranks him first at Malone in total wins and first at Malone in winning percentage.
Gravier's success at Malone is supported by his first-year record of 10 wins, 1 loss, and 1 tie and included a victory over rival Geneva College. The sole loss came in the quarterfinal playoffs for the NAIA national championships. His team also reached the national championship hunt during his last season at Malone, losing to Georgetown College. Three of the four years he coached at Malone, his team was either league champion or co-champion. In spite of his success on the field, he was asked to resign by the administration a week before the season opening game of 1999 after allegations surfaced that he struck a student athlete during a practice session.
Assistant coaching.
Prior to coaching at Malone, he was an assistant coach for the Michigan Tech Huskies and at Southeast Missouri State He also was an assistant at Malone under head coach Joe Palmisano, whom he replaced to be the head coach. He also worked as the tight ends coach at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia.
Bluefield College.
Gravier was the head coach for the Bluefield College Rams in Bluefield, Virginia. The program participated in non-sanctioned "club play" for the 2011 season and joined the NAIA's Mid-South Conference beginning in the 2012 football season.
In their first season since 1941, the Bluefield Rams finished without a single win. Their record was 0–11 overall, recording 0–6 in conference play. In April 2013 during spring drills, he was fired by the school.
Valparaiso.
Gravier became an assistant coach of the Valparaiso Crusaders for the 2013 season. When the head coach was fired with one game to go in the season, he was promoted to interim head coach for the final game. Valparaiso lost their final game that season.
At the end of the season, Dave Cecchini was hired as a full-time replacement.

Anne Cochran

Anne Cochran is a singer-songwriter from Cleveland, Ohio. She is best known as the lead touring vocalist for pianist and songwriter Jim Brickman, with whom she shared the top 5 Adult Contemporary hit single "After All These Years" in 1998. She has also released a number of solo albums, and the single "Someone Is Missing at Christmas" from her album "This is the Season" peaked at number 11 on the US Adult contemporary chart in 2005. She has shared duets with musicians and artists such as Donny Osmond, Michael Feinstein, Collin Raye, Dave Koz, Richie McDonald, Orlagh Fallon, Tracy Silverman, Jeff Timmons, Kristy Starling, Mario Frangoulis, Michael Feinstein, Wayne Brady, Michael Bolton, Linda Eder and Mark Masri.
Early life.
Anne Cochran was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. She has stated she started singing around the same age she learned to talk, and at a young age her mother introduced her to singers such as Doris Day, Ella and Peggy Lee. Her older sister also introduced her to groups such as The Beatles, The Kinks, Paul Simon, and Motown. She soon started gaining stage experience as the lead in school musicals, and from her teens was successively the lead vocalist of a trio of Cleveland rock bands: Hash Brown Band, Timmy and the Tuxedos, and Nitebridge.
While attending Shaker Heights High School she became good friends with musician Jim Brickman, and they formed a band together. Together they won the You Light Up My Life radio contest, though they couldn't attend the attached cocktail lounge gigs because they were under 18.
Cochran earned a degree in theater and voice from Case Western Reserve University, and continued to perform in the Cleveland area after graduating. 
She met her husband soon after launching her self-titled debut album under the Fishhead label. The next nine years were largely devoted to raising their two sons, which put band life on hold. During this time, however, she pursued a career as a studio vocalist, singing in over 500 commercials.
Work with Jim Brickman.
In 1995, Jim Brickman had established a career as a successful songwriter and pianist in the genre of Adult Contemporary. He asked Cochran to be his female vocalist on the Asian tour following the release of his album "By Heart". Their first major concert in the US took place at Lincoln Center, where they displayed the rapport that became their trademark. According to Brickman, “Onstage, trust seems to be the glue. Anne knows me well enough that if I go off on a (piano) tangent, there’s a reason for it.”
"After All These Years" (1998).
In 1998 Brickman released the album "Visions of Love," which featured Cochran as the vocalist on the single "After All These Years". The single, released by Windham Hill, proved to be Cochran's break into the mainstream when it became a top five hit on the radio. 
Cochran became a regular fixture as touring lead vocalist with Cochran as well, and performed with him in such venues as Severance Hall and Carnegie Hall.
She sang "After All these Years" to accompany Olympic Medalist Rosalind Sumner's final skating performances with "Stars On Ice" in venues as Madison Square Garden, Gund Arena and also on NBC's "A Golden Moment." 
She appears on all four of the "Brickman and Friends" PBS specials, and often co-hosts Brickman's syndicated radio show. She also performs on Brickman's annual Brickman Cruise. Her solo vocals are featured on Brickman's 2011 Christmas CD "All Is Calm". 
As of 2012, she continues to tour as lead vocalist with Brickman and his live band.
Solo career.
Cochran has written and released a number of solo albums, starting with "Thinking of You" in 1998. She released the solo album "Lucky Girl" in 2000. The review AllMusic noted her "smooth voice and gentle style." "Cover Girl" followed in 2005, and the album "All My Best: A Collection" was released that year as well. In 2005, she also released the Christmas album "This is the Season." Her single from the album, "Someone is Missing at Christmas," peaked at 11 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. In 2008, she released an all original cd, "Close To Me" and in 2010, "Christmas Wish."
"Close to Me" (2009).
In 2009 she launched her solo album "Close to Me" to a standing room only audience at Cleveland's Nighttown. The album include several tracks written by Cochran, a duet with Jim Brickman, and three original tracks by Tracy Silverman, who also produced and recorded the album in Nashville. According to Fanfix, "it's an amazing album and a must have for any true music lover." According to the same review, "Hearing Anne sing for the first time is breathtaking. It's like stepping into a church and watching the light catch a beautiful piece of stained glass. It bring that same kind of peace and joy to me."
Appearances.
She tours to perform her solo material, as well as touring with Jim Brickman. She has performed with the symphony and pops orchestras of Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Louisville, Kansas City, Hartford, Cincinnati, Nashville, Columbus. She has also performed with Linda Eder and shared duets with Collin Raye, Donny Osmond, Dave Koz, Tracy Silverman, Jeff Timmons, Kristy Starling, Greek tenor Mario Frangoulis, Michael Feinstein, Broadway's Mike Eldred, Wayne Brady, Michael Bolton, Orlagh Fallon, Richie McDonald, and Canadian Mark Masri.
Cochran hosted a fundraiser with comedian Bob Newhart and has sung the National Anthem at a number of Cleveland sports games. She performed "The Star Spangled Banner" for ESPN's broadcast of NCAA's Women Basketball Championship Final 2008 playoff. She also periodically co-hosts NBC's "Good Company Today"."
Personal life.
Cochran continues to live in Cleveland with her husband and two sons.

Contents.
The "Rules Cyclopedia" contained all the major rules, compiled and revised from the "Dungeons & Dragons Basic Rules", as well as the "Expert Rules", "Companion Rules", and "Master Rules" boxed sets. This was the second revision to the "D&D" rules. These guidelines allow a player to develop and play characters from levels 1-36, and includes a special section on skills. The book also contained an overview of the Known World (Mystara) and Hollow World campaign settings. It also has rules on how to convert characters between the "Dungeons & Dragons" game and the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" second edition game.
The "Rules Cyclopedia" includes two optional classes to the game: the druid (introduced in the "Companion" ruleset) and the mystic (introduced in the "Master" ruleset, similar to the monk class found in "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons").
Publication history.
The "D&D Rules Cyclopedia" was designed by Aaron Allston and published by TSR, Inc. This 304-page hardback book features cover artwork by Jeff Easley and interior art by Terry Dykstra.
Reception.
Rick Swan reviewed the "D&D Rules Cyclopedia" for "Dragon" magazine #184 (August 1992). He calls the book a "stunningly comprehensive volume", explaining that it "includes more detail than most GMs will ever use [...] but if you want it, you can probably find it here". According to Swan, "Best of all, the material is a joy to read, thanks to the breezy style of Aaron Allston, who must've been genetically engineered to write RPG rules. This is a must for serious fans."
Shannon Appelcline said that the book "was a nice compilation that was appreciated by the fans".

Richard Cooey

Richard Wade Cooey II (June 9, 1967 – October 14, 2008) was an American murderer. With Clinton Dickens, he was responsible for the murders of Wendy Offredo and Dawn McCreery in Akron, Ohio, on September 1, 1986.
Youth.
Cooey was born in Akron, Ohio. He lived there with his grandmother until high school; he then began living with his father in Stow, a bordering suburb, but only during the school year. Cooey graduated from Stow High School in 1985 and enlisted in the U.S. Army. The following summer he returned on leave.
Case.
Early on the morning of September 1, 1986, Cooey, Dickens and Kenneth Horonetz, Jr. were throwing chunks of concrete off the Stoner Street Bridge onto U.S. Interstate 77 in Akron. One of the objects dropped by Dickens struck the vehicle of a University of Akron student, 21-year-old Wendy Offredo. Also in the vehicle was another student, 20-year-old Dawn McCreery.
Pretending to rescue both students, the three men actually ended up kidnapping them. Cooey, then age 19, and Dickens, age 17, took the women to a field behind the Rolling Acres Mall where they assaulted, stabbed, and tortured them for three and a half hours, eventually choking and bludgeoning them to death and abandoning the bodies. They also carved X's into the victims abdomens. Cooey and Dickens each blamed the other for the actual murders, Horonetz having left the car before the violence began. Cooey bragged about the murders to close friends and was eventually turned in to authorities. He was convicted on November 14, 1986, and subsequently sentenced to death. Dickens, who was a minor at the time of the murders, could not be sentenced to death under Ohio laws, and is serving a life sentence in prison. Horonetz, then age 18, and another suspect, Terry Grant (age 19), were charged with obstruction of justice in the case for participating in the destruction of evidence. Grant was sentenced to two years' probation. Horonetz was released on parole after serving one year of a three-to-fifteen year prison sentence for felonious assault. Cooey later claimed that he didn't kill or beat anyone. He admitted to raping the women, claiming he did "rape under duress". He also stated that he was under the influence of alcohol and illegal drugs such as cocaine and opium at the time. Court records showed that Cooey had a very rough upbringing. His father, Richard Cooey Sr. would abuse him in gruesome manners on a regular basis. He spent his teen years living with his grandmother, Audrey Cooey. Both of them would occasionally visit him while he was on death row.
Execution.
Cooey was confined at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility. On July 24, 2003, he was scheduled to be executed. In an interview, Cooey said that he had not planned to make a final statement. The execution was stayed, to allow further investigation in the case. Cooey attempted to escape from prison in February 2005, along with another prisoner named Maxwell White. They were spotted by guards when attempting to climb over a series of barbed wire fences. Following additional appeals, requests for clemency, and stays of execution, Cooey's final appeal was rejected. He argued that his obesity rendered lethal injection an inhumane form of execution. He claimed that because his veins were clogged with cholesterol, the first drug administered in lethal injections, a drug intended to induce paralysis to ensure the prisoner feels no pain, would have only partial effect, which would cause him to suffer greatly when the lethal drugs were administered. He also claimed that prison food was responsible for his obesity. On the night of Monday, October 13, he chose to consume a last meal. The meal consisted of T-bone steak with A-1 sauce, onion rings, French fries, four eggs over easy, toast with butter, hash browns, a pint of rocky road ice cream, a Mountain Dew soft drink and authentic bear claw pastries from the bakery. He ate until shortly after midnight while watching local television. Cooey spent most of the night sitting on his bed and pacing quietly in his cell. He fell asleep at 4:06 a.m. in the morning of Tuesday, October 14, then woke at 5:20 a.m. and did not eat breakfast. He later met with an attorney and a spiritual adviser. The McCreery family chose to witness the execution, and the Offredo family as well as his own chose not to attend. When asked if he had any final words, he angrily said "You (expletive) haven't paid any attention to anything I've said in the last 22 years, why would anyone pay any attention to anything I've had to say now?". At 10:20 a.m. the warden signaled the start of the flow of drugs. One put Cooey to sleep, a second paralyzed him, and a third stopped his heart. He tapped his fingers on the gurney as the process unfolded. He then died at 10:28. A black hearse parked in the courtyard then took his body to a mortuary. He was immediately cremated at the state's expense. According to his wishes, Cooey's ashes were taken to Ireland by his attorneys.

Trade Show Exhibitors Association

The Trade Show Exhibitors Association (TSEA) is a US-based non-profit organization created to promote the development of the trade show industry and the expertise of professionals in exhibit and event marketing. The TSEA collects and disseminates statistics pertaining to the exhibit industry in order to improve the effectiveness of exhibiting.
History.
In October 1966, a group of manufacturers attended an Exhibitor's Seminar in Columbus, Ohio, sponsored by the Ohio Valley Chapter of the Exhibit Designers and Producers Association. During the course of this meeting, a group of companies volunteered to form the nucleus of a national exhibitors association to "voice the industrial exhibitor's feeling concerning the effective use of the trade show as a marketing medium."
Mr. Raymond Snyder of the Reliance Electric Company, who was Chairman of the committee, suggested a survey to determine the interest of other manufacturers in a national exhibitors association. The committee conducted this survey by letter, addressed generally to the "trade show manager" of some 2,200 major companies, pointing out the need for improvement of the trade show medium and asking if there was interest in forming an association of exhibitors to work together toward this end. Approximately 400 companies responded affirmatively, many of them taking time to comment on their own exhibition problems. They indicated a clear-cut need for a group to act as industry spokesmen.
On the basis of the response to this survey, the committee began to set up a national association. After an intensive search, the group retained the services of Smith, Bucklin & Associates, Inc., a Chicago-based trade association management firm, to act as Secretary-Managers for the new association. William W. Carpenter, SmithBucklin Vice President, was named NTSEA (National Trade Show Exhibitors Association) Executive Secretary.
Connections.
The TSEA facilitates networking in respect to the trade show industry with regional TSEA chapters in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, New York, Northern California, Southern California, and Toronto. 
The TSEA has a number of sister associations, among them are the Center for Exhibition Industry Research, Exhibit Designers & Producers Association (EDPA), Healthcare Convention & Exhibitors Association (HCEA), International Association for Exhibitions and Events (IAEE), Exhibitor Appointed Contractors Association (EACA), and Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA).
Events and Meetings.
TSEA Red Diamond Congress 2010 - Members of the Trade Show Exhibitors Association (TSEA), comprising exhibit marketing, along with exhibit builders, agencies, show producers and other vested suppliers.
TSEA convened its inaugural Red Diamond Congress event, a three-day leadership summit held in Orlando, FL, April 25–27, 2010. The event was to directly address such key issues as third-party audits and housing and labor practices. Results included significant understanding and collaborative insight into the issues, potential solutions and a roadmap forward.
Certification.
The TSEA provides for its members a community monitored certification program geared towards obtaining Continuing Education Units (CEUs). CEUs are nationally recognized units earned through participation in qualifying educational programs. By gaining CEUs, a participant eventually obtains the highest recognition of professional achievement within the exhibit industry, which is the Certified Manager of Exhibits (CME). This is the only association-sponsored certification program that recognizes professionalism in exhibit management and marketing. 
TSEA also administers the CME/H designation for the Healthcare Convention and Exhibitors Association.

Face Value (book)

Face Value is a 1983 anthology of collected journalism by South African journalist Jani Allan. The book is compiled from selections of Allan's successful gossip and popular culture column Just Jani that appeared in the "Sunday Times". She was voted ""the most admired person in South Africa."" in a Gallup poll commissioned by the newspaper. The book was published by Longstreet publishers in Cape Town and released in South Africa in the 1980s.
Synopsis.
The book is a selection of interviews and photographs of public figures from various fields such as entertainment, sport, business, art and politics. Allan also contributed a column-style introduction to each chapter. Andrzej Sawa provided the photographs of the interviewees.
Five of the interviewees (Sol Kerzner, Danie Craven, Pieter-Dirk Uys, Walter Battiss and Taubie Kushlick) were featured in the "They shaped our century" survey, a top 100 list published about which people had the greatest influence on South Africa during the twentieth century. "Sunday Times" editor, Tertius Myburgh wrote a foreword for the collection.
Author's note.
"I do not think that for one moment that in a brief interview I can write an accurate-every-time character-revealing piece. But my aim has always been to convey as honestly as I can my first impressions on FACE VALUE, with no 'Ums', 'Ers' or retakes."
Reception.
The book received favourable reviews;
"She soon developed a highly individual style and the Jani Allan column, one of the most successful features in Africa's biggest newspaper, followed. She's become a formidable journalist...There's a touch of Tom Wolfe's 'new journalism' about her writing, but it is never contrived. In her choice of subjects she's attracted by what she calls 'the boquet of money' and she's good on those ubiquitous creatures of our time, the 'celebrities', whom she is able to send up without the bitchiness which tends to put me off some lady writers of the adversary school of journalism. When she's touched by something - an individual, a cause, or some little act of valour - her writing reflects immense warmth and humanity." Tertius Myburgh, Editor of the "Sunday Times"
"Your piece on me acted like a bicycle pump and I mooned around for ages, smiling foolishly and cannoning off the wallls." Frank Muir
"The only girl who ever knocked me out" Mike Weaver
"Guy Fawkes couldn't brighten up Sunday better." Graham Bell
"She is not destructive - but she does have a particular facility for puncturing pomposity" Joe Sutton

.500 No. 2 Express

The .500 No. 2 Express (also called the .577/.500 and, in Germany, 12.7mm British No. 2) is a British centerfire fire rifle cartridge.
Designed as a black powder round in 1882 or 1883, it resembles the .577/.500 Magnum Nitro Express, but uses a shorter case; the two are not interchangeable. It was offered in single or double rifles, as well as a variety of Martini-based lever guns.
In power, the .500 No. 2 is comparable to the contemporary .577/.500 Magnum and .50-110 Winchester, or the modern .30-'06. It is sufficient for elk, deer, moose, or bear at medium range or in woods and thin-skinned dangerous game, including lions and tigers, but not thick-skinned animals such as elephant. It was popular in India with contemporary shooters, and tended to be offered in heavy rifles.
The bullet is virtually the same as the .50 Sharps, and Lyman molds can be used to produce cast examples for reloading. Factory loads used about between 130-160 gr (8.4-10.4 g) of Fg.
Moderately popular in its day, the round has long since ceased to be offered commercially. Black powder rifles in this caliber should use somewhat light smokeless loads.

Francis Frangipane

Francis Frangipane is a Christian evangelical minister and author. He is the founding pastor of River of Life Ministries in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States. In 2002, he also launched an international, online school called "In Christ's Image Training" (ICIT). This training lays a foundation of truth based on four principal themes: Christlikeness, humility, prayer and unity. ICIT has students in over one hundred fifteen nations and territories and in all 50 U.S states. Additionally, over the past decades, Frangipane has served on a number of other ministry boards. However, in recent years he has gradually resigned from these various boards. As of June 2009, he has also retired from his position as senior pastor of River of Life Ministries. In this more simplified life, Frangipane is devoting himself to prayer and the ministry of God's word. 
Francis Frangipane has an active partnership with the Mission America Coalition, consisting of leaders from 81 denominations and over 400 ministries and networks. He is also a welcomed teacher in various Charismatic and Evangelical church settings, in both the black and white communities.
Biography.
Francis Frangipane was born in 1946 and grew up in Lodi, New Jersey. After graduating from high school in 1964, Frangipane entered the U.S. Air Force, where he was discharged honorably as a sergeant on February 2, 1969. He relocated briefly to Berkeley, California and then Honolulu, Hawaii before returning to the mainland U.S. These were the days when the hippie movement was emerging, and Frangipane, like countless other young people, was searching for meaning. He traveled extensively throughout the United States and Canada. Eventually his travels brought him to the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia where he became a Christian on November 26, 1970. Five months later he met his wife-to-be, Denise Piscitelli, and led her to the Lord. In October 1971 they were married. 
In 1972 Francis and Denise received ministerial training at Grace Chapel in Southern California; by early fall they had moved to Hilo, Hawaii to start a church. Their little work grew to about twenty-five people, most of whom they had personally led to Christ. They also had their first child during this time. 
After fourteen months, however, they felt their time in Hawaii was complete. A church in the Detroit, Michigan area offered them a pastoral position. For the remainder of the seventies, they led a small church of approximately 100 people; they also planted eight churches and home groups in southeastern Michigan and Ontario, Canada. 
They relocated to Iowa in 1980 where, with the addition of four more children and a Vietnamese foster child, their family grew to eight. These were hard times. Francis was self-employed and the family was very poor. It was during this time that Francis began to develop his writing skills. It was also a three year season of being shut in with God; the only spiritual food that nourished him came from the words of Christ in the Gospels. 
In 1982 the opportunity to pastor a church in the Cedar Rapids area was offered to the Frangipanes. After a season of prayer, they accepted this new assignment. Pastor Francis soon found himself united with several other pastors from various evangelical denominations who met in one another's sanctuaries for monthly prayer. After three years, the founding minister of this prayer group left the city, and in 1985 Francis and another local pastor (from the local Assemblies of God) picked up the prayer initiative. They opened it up for intercessors as well and increased their times together from monthly to weekly. The group soon multiplied, which led to many other interdenominational citywide events. 
During this time, Frangipane began to write in earnest. His first book, "Holiness, Truth and the Presence of God" (1985), was a compilation of his essays and sermons. He wrote his second book, "The Three Battlegrounds", in 1989 when asked to speak on spiritual warfare at a conference in Kansas City. Both these books became best-sellers. Since 1985, he has written fourteen books including four "In Christ's Image Training" manuals, developed for his online school, plus a number of study booklets.
He has traveled throughout the world, ministering to thousands of pastors and intercessors from many backgrounds.
Francis' wish is to see established in every city "Christlike pastors and intercessors, united before God, revealing the love of Christ to their communities".
Pastor Frangipane's ministry and writing is widely accepted in the Evangelical church, with endorsements from Jack Hayford President, International Foursquare Church, David Bryant, Founder of Concerts of Prayer international, and president of Proclaim Hope, Phil Miglioratti, National Pastors’ Prayer Network among many others on his website linked below.
Writings.
Frangipane is the author of several books that have been translated into more than 30 languages.

Aysgarth School

Aysgarth School is a day and boarding preparatory school for boys located in the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales near Bedale, North Yorkshire and is the only all-boys boarding and day prep school in the north of England. Girls may attend up to age 8 (Year 2).
History.
Aysgarth was founded in 1877 to prepare boys aged 8–13 years to go on to national public schools. The school suffered a severe fire in the 1930s. It has a good track record of sending pupils to top public schools around the country including Harrow, Radley and Eton and to Sedbergh and Ampleforth nearby.
Initially founded as a traditional boarding preparatory school, it now welcomes day boys as well. Oak House, the pre-prep and nursery day school, founded in 1993, caters for boys and girls from 2½ to 8. Pupils are housed in an attractive building within the grounds of the prep school and they have access to prep school facilities such as the games fields, sports hall, swimming pool, computer suite, music school, library and chapel.
Boarding & Pastoral Care.
Although conveniently local to areas such as Catterick, the school also has boys from all over the country and overseas enrol due to their reputation and willingness to arrange for children to be escorted on the train by staff to London and Edinburgh.
The key pastoral care team includes the headmaster and his wife, the housemaster, the matrons and school nurse, and the form tutors, almost all of whom live on site. Close contact is maintained with parents and all boys have access to e-mail and telephones.
Terms.
The school year is divided into three terms: Lent, (January to Easter); Summer, (After Easter until June); and Michaelmas, (Autumn through to Christmas).
Sets.
In an emulation of public school houses, (and possibly to encourage British military style camaraderie) the boys are grouped together into sets. Each boy is added to a set when they join the school and will remain in that set until he leaves. The sets are named after ancient Greek city states: Athens, Corinth, Sparta, Thebes. During the terms each boy can accumulate credits or demerits which are publicly displayed.
Each set has a colour that can be worn to identify set members during sporting events. The colour for Spartans is red. This should not be confused with the school colours of the school tie, which are blue and black.

Swimming at the 1980 Summer Paralympics

Swimming at the 1980 Summer Paralympics consisted of 192 events.
In certain events, there were only three competitors, thus guaranteeing each a medal upon successfully completing the race. In others, there were fewer than three; in the women's 4x100 metre freestyle relay C-D, for instance, the Canadian team swam unopposed, obtaining gold upon completing the event. The women's 3x50 metre medley relay CP C was the only event in which no medal was awarded. The United States team were the only competitors, but were disqualified during the race; thus, no team completed the event.

The Sheltering Sky (film)

The Sheltering Sky is a 1990 British-Italian drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci starring Debra Winger and John Malkovich. The film is based on the 1949 novel by Paul Bowles (who narrates the film and appears in a cameo role) about a couple who journey to northern Africa in the hopes of rekindling their marriage but soon fall prey to the dangers that surround them.
Plot.
Three Americans from New York arrive in Tangier in 1947. Port Moresby (John Malkovich) and his wife Kit (Debra Winger) are accompanied by their friend George Tunner (Campbell Scott) on a trip that will take them deep into the Sahara Desert. Tunner observes, "We're probably the first tourists they've had since the war" to which Kit replies, "We're not tourists. We're travelers." While Tunner plans to return home in a few weeks, Port and Kit plan on staying for a year or two.
While awaiting transport to a hotel, the group meets the Lyles – Mrs. Lyle (Jill Bennett), a travel writer and her son Eric (Timothy Spall). After arriving at the hotel, Port invites Kit to accompany him for a walk of the city. After she refuses and rebuffs his romantic advances, Port angrily leaves. During his walk he meets a prostitute (Amina Annabi). The two have sex and the prostitute attempts to steal his wallet. Port quickly leaves and is chased by a mob.
The next morning Tunner arrives at Kit's room to take her shopping. Not wanting Tunner to know that Port stayed out all night, she removes the covers from his bed to make it appear that he slept there. As Kit and Tunner are preparing to leave, a disheveled Port arrives. Seeing his bed, he assumes that Tunner spent the night with Kit.
Port and Kit once again encounter the Lyles and are offered a ride in their car to their next destination but are informed that there is no room for Tunner. Port accepts the ride with the Lyles while Kit takes the train with Tunner. Tunner and Kit awake the next morning in Kit's room after a drunken tryst.
Suspicious of Kit's relationship with Tunner, Port arranges for Eric Lyle to provide Tunner with transportation to Messad on the pretext that Port and Kit will meet him later. Eric agrees but also steals Port's passport.
In Bounoura, Port discovers his passport missing. Even after being informed by local officials that the passport can be recovered in Messad, Port decides to proceed to El Ga'a with Kit in order to avoid a meeting with Tunner. Port then contracts typhoid and dies at a French foreign legion post leaving Kit alone deep in the Sahara.
Kit wanders in the desert until she is rescued by a caravan led by Belqassim (Eric Vu-An). After the caravan arrives at Belqassim's home, he disguises Kit as a boy and locks her in a guest house. Although held captive, Kit welcomes Belqassim's advances and the two begin an affair. Kit is soon discovered by Belqassim's wives who order her to leave. Kit finds herself disoriented in the local marketplace and is found in a hospital by staff of the American embassy. She is transported back to Tangier where she began her journey and is told that Tunner is waiting for her. After arriving at the hotel, Kit flees into the city before Tunner can meet her.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack, composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the LAFCA Award for Best Music.
Critical reception.
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 50 percent of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 24 reviews.
Among those praising the film was "New York Times" film critic Vincent Canby, who described it as a "long, beautifully modulated cry of despair." In 1998, Paul Bowles wrote a new preface to the novel in which he stated "the less said about the film now, the better."

William Gager

William Gager (1555–1622) was an English jurist, now known for his Latin dramas.
He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford.
His works were produced at the University of Oxford, from 1582 to 1592. He was considered one of the major dramatists of the late sixteenth century. Apart from one comedy, "Rivales", which has not survived, his works were all Latin tragedies. They include "Meleager" (1582), "Dido" (1583) and "Ulysses Redux" (1592). He stayed closer to the model of Senecan tragedy than other contemporaries, and adapted Seneca's "Hippolytus" in 1592, with the addition of scenes.
He was also a neo-Latin poet.

When the dust settled Rocky was ordered off, but five minutes elapsed before he was finally escorted from the field by Bill Fallowfield, secretary of the Rugby Football League. The British players waited for Fages to go, but in vain. There was 17-17 draw at Knowsley Road, St Helens; Great Britain won 21-10 at Stade André Moga, Bordeaux.

Alongside fellow Wakefield Trinity players, Neil Fox, Harold Poynton, Gerry Round and Jack Wilkinson, Rocky was selected for the Great Britain squad to play in 1962 tour of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. This Great Britain team would be the nearest to achieving a 3-0 Ashes whitewash of the Kangaroos on Australian turf to date.

In the third Test of the 1962 Ashes series, Australia's Dud Beattie suffered a broken collarbone, and knowing he would have to leave the field anyway (Substitutions not being permitted until 1964), Beattie ignited a fight with Rocky, it resulted in the referee sending both players from the field. As Beattie was being half-carried from the arena by an ambulance man, Rocky prodded and remonstrated with Beattie for his actions. A controversial last-minute Ken Irvine try against the weakened defence, Mick Sullivan having already been sent off, and the subsequent touchline goal resulted in a 17-18 defeat, although a whitewash was denied, Great Britain won the Ashes series 2-1.
After the Australia Ashes Tests, With Eric Ashton (Captain), Alex Murphy and Don Fox injured, Rocky took over the captaincy for the two tests in New Zealand. However, these and other injuries depleted the squad to such an extent that both tests in Carlaw Park, Auckland were lost 0-19 and 8-27.
After the New Zealand Tests, only fourteen players from the original squad of twenty-five were uninjured, thirteen of whom went on to play three exhibition matches in South Africa. Despite being top try scorer, with 22 tries in the tests, Billy Boston could not be considered for selection purely due to the colour of his skin, as this was apartheid-era South Africa. Consequently, coach Colin Hutton became a stand-in reserve. The squad for the South African exhibition matches was; Eric Fraser (Warrington); Ike Southward (Workington Town), Peter Small (Castleford), Neil Fox (Wakefield Trinity), Mick Sullivan (St Helens); Dave Bolton (Wigan), Harold Poynton (Wakefield Trinity); Jack Wilkinson (Wakefield Trinity), John Shaw (Halifax), Ken Noble (Huddersfield), Laurie Gilfedder (Warrington), Dick Huddart (St Helens), Derek Turner (Wakefield Trinity); Reserve: Colin Hutton (Hull Kingston Rovers).
In 1962, Rocky played his final match for Great Britain in the 17-12 defeat to France at Stade Gilbert Brutus, Perpignan.
Coaching career.
Rocky was head coach for Castleford at Wheldon Road from ? until ?, and is regarded as the best Castleford coach of all time.
Rocky was Head Coach for Wakefield Trinity at Belle Vue from July 1983 until February 1984.
Film career.
Rocky appeared in the 1963 film "This Sporting Life". The film's director, Lindsay Anderson, instructed Rocky to make a scene where the main character Frank Machin loses seven teeth, following a scrum, look realistic. Richard Harris who was playing Frank Machin was knocked out and filming for the day was abandoned.
Peer accolades.
In 2003, BBC Rugby League commentator Ray French was asked to name the six 'hardest' men ever to play Rugby League, he named Rocky along with; Vince Karalius, Barrie McDermott, Ray Price, Gorden Tallis & Cliff Watson.
According to Lion Phil Jackson "Vince Karalius was much lauded here as one of the best loose forwards to go (to Australia) and I reckon Derek Turner was ["sic"] a better player".
Personal life.
For a number of years, Rocky and his son Darren have run a removals business, Derek Turner Ltd, based in Ossett near Wakefield.
Representative career whilst at Wakefield Trinity.
Derek "Rocky" Turner, came to Oldham from Hull K.R., playing his first match against Hunslet on 3 September 1955. A loose forward of immense power and fearless determination, Derek was seen by many as the last piece required to complete the puzzle that became the great team of the 1950s. 
A born leader, with never a backward step, Rocky demonstrated a terrific work rate on both attack and defence, giving everything in the eighty minutes while inspiring others to do the same and was always a thorn in the side of the opposition. Although it is interesting to note that Rocky was never captain while at Watersheddings.
An integral part of the mid to late 1950s success of Oldham, his big regret was that the club never reached Wembley. Still history remembers Derek as one of the great Wembley captains after Rocky led Wakefield Trinity to success at the famous London stadium in 1960 (v Hull), 1962 (v Huddersfield) and 1963 (v Wigan).

Acromyrmex

Acromyrmex is a genus of New World ants of the subfamily Myrmicinae. This genus is found in South America and parts of Central America and the Caribbean Islands, and contains 31 known species.
Commonly known as "leafcutter ants" they comprise one of the two genera of advanced attines within the tribe Attini, along with "Atta".
Anatomy.
"Acromyrmex" species' hard outer covering, the exoskeleton or cuticle, functions as armour, protection against dangerous solar waves, an attachment base for internal muscles, and to prevent water loss. It is divided into three main parts; the head, thorax, and abdomen. A small segment between the thorax and abdomen, the petiole, is split into two nodes in "Acromyrmex" species.
The antennae are the most important sense organs "Acromyrmex" species possess, and are jointed so the ant can extend them forward to investigate an object. It can retract them back over its head when in a dangerous situation, for example, a fight. "Acromyrmex" species have eyes, but their eyesight is very poor. Like all insects, the eye is "compound", meaning it is made up of many eyelets called ommatidia, the number of these eyelets varies according to species. In the worker castes, male ants tend to have more ommatadia than other castes. The ocelli, which are generally found on tops of the heads of queen "Acromyrmex", are thought to aid aerial navigation by sunlight.
"Acromyrmex" is dark red in color. In addition to the standard ant anatomy, the back of the thorax has a series of spines which help it maneuver material such as leaf fragments on its back.
"Acromyrmex" can be identified from the closely related "Atta" genus of leafcutter ants by their having four pairs of spines and a rough exoskeleton on the upper surface of the thorax compared to three pairs of spines and a smooth exoskeleton in "Atta".
Much of the inside of the "Acromyrmex" head is occupied by the muscles that close the jaws; the muscles that open the jaws are a lot smaller. The brain, though tiny, is a very complex organ, and allows the "Acromyrmex" to learn and react to its surroundings. It can remember colony odour, navigation, and where it has placed a certain object.
The heart is a long, tubular organ running the entire length of the body, from the brain to the tip of the abdomen. It has valves within it that prevent blood from flowing the wrong way. The fluids bathing the internal organs is circulated by the heart; these fluids then filter through the organs and tissues. The pharynx, which is part of the gut, controlled by six muscles, pumps food into the oesophagus. Debris in the food, such as soil, is filtered before it enters the oesophagus and is collected in a tiny trap, the infrabuccal pocket. When this pocket becomes full, the "Acromyrmex" ant empties it into an area within or outside the nest designated as a waste products area.
Several glands in the head secrete various substances, such as those responsible for the digestion of food. Another gland within the head produces digestive and, in some species, alarm chemicals; these chemicals are used to alert nearby ants of impending danger, and any ant that detects this alarm will automatically go into "battle mode". If an ant is crushed, a huge blast of this chemical is released, causing the entire colony to go into "battle mode".
The thorax contains muscles to operate the legs and wings and the nerve cells to co-ordinate their movements; also contained in this part of the body is the heart and oesophagus.
The abdomen contains the stomachs, poison glands, ovaries in the queen, and the Dufour's gland, among other things. "Acromyrmex" ants have two "stomachs"; a dry, social stomach in which they can store food and later regurgitate to larvae, the queen and other ants. This is separated from the stomach proper by a small valve; once food enters the second stomach, it becomes contaminated with gastric juices and cannot be regurgitated. The exact function of the Dufour's gland is unknown, but is thought to be involved in the release of the chemicals used in the production of odour trails, which the ants use to recruit nest mates to a food source. It may also produce sex-attractant chemicals.
Ecology.
Reproduction.
Winged females and males leave their respective nests "en masse" and engage in a nuptial flight known as the "revoada". Each female mates with multiple males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs to set up a colony.
Once on the ground, the female loses her wings and searches for a suitable underground lair in which to found her colony. The success rate of these young queens is very low and only 2.5% will go on to establish a long-lived colony.
Before leaving their parent colonies, winged females take a small section of fungus into their infrabucchal pouches to 'seed' the fungus gardens of incipient colonies, cutting and collecting the first few sections of leaf themselves.
Colony hierarchy.
A mature leafcutter colony can contain more than 8 million ants (the maximum size of the colony varies between species), mostly sterile female workers. They are divided into castes, based mostly on size, that perform different functions. "Acromyrmex" ants exhibit a high degree of biological polymorphism, four castes being present in established colonies - minims (or "garden ants"), minors, mediae and majors. Majors are also known as soldiers or dinergates. Each caste has a specific function within the colony. "Acromyrmex" ants are less polymorphic than the other genus of leafcutter ants "Atta", meaning there is comparatively less difference in size from the smallest to largest types of "Acromymex". The high degree of polymorphism in this genus is also suggestive of its high degree of advancement.
Ant-fungus mutualism.
Like "Atta", "Acromyrmex" societies are based on an ant-fungus mutualism, and different species use different species of fungus, but all of the fungi the ants use are members of the genus "Leucocoprinus". The ants actively cultivate their fungus on a medium of masticated leaf tissue. This is the sole food of the queen and other colony members that remain in the nest. The mediae also gain subsistence from plant sap they ingest whilst physically cutting out sections of leaf from a variety of plants.
This mutualistic relationship is further augmented by another symbiotic partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially the ants use portable antimicrobials. Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungus' reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from it. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The only two other groups of insects that have evolved fungus-based agriculture are ambrosia beetles and termites. The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae and the adult ants feed off the leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive.
In addition to feeding the fungal garden with foraged food, mainly consisting of leaves, it is protected from "Escovopsis" by the antibiotic secretions of Actinobacteria (genus "Pseudonocardia"). This mutualistic microorganism lives in the metapleural glands of the ants. Actinobacteria are responsible for producing the majority of the world's antibiotics today.
Waste management.
Leaf-cutter ants have very specific roles for taking care of the fungal garden and dumping the refuse. Waste management is a key role for each colony's longevity. The necrotrophic parasite "Escovopsis" of the fungal cultivar threatens the ants' food source, and is of course a constant danger to the ants. The waste-transporters and waste heap workers are the older, more dispensable leaf-cutter ants, ensuring the healthier and younger leaf-cutter ants can work on the fungal garden. Waste-transporters take the waste, which consists of used substrate and discarded fungus, to the waste heap. Once dropped off at the refuse dump, heap workers organise the waste and constantly shuffle it around to aid decomposition.
Foraging behaviour.
"Acromyrmex" has evolved to change food plants constantly, preventing a colony from completely stripping off leaves and thereby killing trees, thus avoiding negative biological feedback on account of their sheer numbers. However, this does not diminish the huge quantities of foliage they harvest.
Once foraging workers locate a resource in their environment, they will lay down a pheromone trail as they return to the colony. Other workers then follow the pheromone trail to the resource. As more workers return to the nest, laying down pheremones, the stronger the trail becomes. The strength to which workers adhere to the trail (trail fidelity) depends mostly on environmental factors, such as the quality of the resource.
Interactions with humans.
In some parts of their range, "Acromyrmex" species can be quite a nuisance to humans, defoliating crops and damaging roads and farmland with their nest-making activities. For example, "Acromyrmex octospinosus" ant harvest huge quantities of foliage, so they have become agricultural pests on the various Caribbean islands where they have been introduced, such as Guadeloupe.
In Central America, leafcutter ants are referred to as "Wee Wee" ants, though not based on their size. They are one of the largest ants in Central America.
Deterring the leafcutter ant "Acromyrmex lobicornis" from defoliating crops has been found simpler than first expected. Collecting the refuse from the nest and placing it over seedlings or around crops resulted in a deterrent effect over a period of 30 days.
Species.
The genus "Acromyrmex" contains the following species:

Semantic targeting

Semantic targeting is a technique enabling the delivery of targeted advertising for advertisements appearing on websites and is used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns. The selection of advertisements are served by automated systems based on the content displayed to the user. 
Origins.
Semantic Targeting has originated from the developments arising from Semantic Web. The Semantic Web enables the representation of concepts expressed in human language to data in such a way that facilitates automatic processing, where software can programmatically understand and reason how different elements of data are related. The concept of semantic targeting utilises this capability to identify these concepts and the contexts in which they occur, enabling marketers to deliver highly targeted and specific ad campaigns to webpages.
The evolution of online advertising.
The targeting of advertising to specific micro segments is a fundamental requirement for an effective ad campaign. The two methods of targeting of recent times have been behavioral targeting and contextual targeting. It is now generally accepted that these forms have pitfalls for both advertiser and consumer.
Behavioral targeting aggregates data based upon a user's viewing of pages from a website. Generally this is facilitated by the placing of a cookie upon the user's PC. The cookie then reports the user's viewing behavior allowing for the identification of patterns of viewing behavior. However, great concern is expressed about the treatment of the user's right to privacy amongst consumer groups and legislators.
Contextual advertising scans the content of webpages, seeking to identify keywords, against which advertisers have bid to have their ad linked. If a match is made the ad is placed alongside the content, through an automated process. However, such systems are unable to identify the context of the entire page and therefore, a placement could be made against content that is inappropriate, derogatory or insensitive to the subject. They are also unable to identify the sense or meaning of words, leading to a misplacement of ads. For example, the word "orange" can be a color, a fruit, a telecommunications company, a mountain bike, and countless other variants.
How semantic targeting works.
Semantic targeting aims to match the specific context of content on page within a website to an available advertising campaign. A key difference of semantic targeting to a contextual advertising system is that, instead of scanning a page for bided keywords, a semantic system examines all the words and identifies the senses of those words. Because most words are polysemous, i.e. have more than one meaning, without having an understanding of the true context in which words occur, it is possible to incorrectly assign an advertisement where there is no contextual link. A semantic targeting system has to examine all the words before it can accurately identify the subject matter of the entire text and deliver an in context advertisement. For example, if the user is viewing a website relating to golf, where that website uses semantic targeting, the user may see advertisements for golf related topics, such as golf equipment, golf holidays etc. Advertisers can locate their ads in given categories using an ontology (computer science) or taxonomy, ensuring that their ads will only appear in the context that they request. 
Semantic targeting is also capable of identifying the sentiment of a webpage, through effective analysis of the language used on page. Sentiment analysis can determine whether content is talking about a subject in a positive or negative light. If the page was being detrimental about a particular subject, the semantic targeting system could deter the placement of a related ad alongside the story. 
Other capabilities of a semantic targeting system include the availability of brand protection filtering. This can enable the blocking of an ad placed alongside content of a controversial nature. Such systems can deter placement against such subjects as Adult/Erotica, Alcohol, Nudity, Offensive language, Bad News and other such topics. This would then avoid the potentially brand damaging occurrence of, for example, and airline advertising alongside a story about an air disaster.

Congress of the People (South African political party)

The Congress of the People (COPE) is a South African political party formed in 2008 by former members of the African National Congress (ANC). The party was founded by former ANC members Mosiuoa Lekota, Mbhazima Shilowa and Mluleki George to contest the 2009 general election. The party was announced following a national convention held in Sandton on 1 November 2008, and was founded at a congress held in Bloemfontein on 16 December 2008. The name echoes the 1955 Congress of the People at which the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC and other parties, a name strongly contested by the ANC in a legal move dismissed by the Pretoria High Court.
In the 2009 general election, the party received 1 311 027 votes and a 7.42% share of the vote.
History.
52nd ANC national conference.
The birth of the party can be traced back to the 52nd ANC national conference held at Polokwane in December 2007. The conference resulted in the election of Jacob Zuma and his supporters, ahead of Thabo Mbeki and his supporters, to the ANC's governing body, the National Executive Committee. Zuma was elected ANC president ahead of Mbeki. The conference highlighted the different factions within the ANC and brought to the fore the diametrically opposed philosophies between Mbeki and Zuma. This included differences in both style and economic policy – the former pursued neoliberal economic policies and was known for an aloof personality and plotting against his political opponents, while his successor is more left-wing and populist, and has a closer relationship with the South African Communist Party and Congress of South African Trade Unions. The split also revealed underlying ethnic tensions between Zulu and Xhosa speakers, represented by Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki respectively, as they jostled for political predominance.
Zuma corruption trial, recall of Mbeki and reaction.
Jacob Zuma, now elected president of the ANC and ANC candidate for President in the South Africa at the 2009 election, was facing corruption charges in relation to a multi-billion rand arms deal with French manufacturer Thint. Zuma had previously been dismissed by Mbeki as South Africa's vice-president at the start of the arms deal trial.
In 2008 a landmark ruling by high court judge Chris Nicholson found that the re-charging of Zuma by the National Prosecuting Authority was illegal and was unduly influenced by Mbeki due to political motives. The case against Zuma was thus dismissed. As a consequence of the judge's findings of political interference, the ANC's National Executive Committee requested the recall of Mbeki as the country's president. Mbeki tendered his resignation on 21 September 2008 and the resignation became official on 25 September. Many members of Mbeki's cabinet resigned their posts at the same time in solidarity, including vice-president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and other senior cabinet ministers.
The recall of Mbeki brought to the fore simmering tensions within the ANC. On 23 September Mosiuoa Lekota announced that he had served the ANC with "divorce papers" and on 8 October announced that a national convention would be held to discuss the future of South African politics and the possible formation of a new political movement.
Lekota's call resounded with many Mbeki supporters who started handing in their resignations to the ANC to join Lekota's movement. Notable resignations include those of former Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa, former Western Cape minister of safety and security Leonard Ramatlakane and Mluleki George. Across the country many regular ANC members also handed in their resignations in public demonstrations, burning their ANC membership cards. The resignation movement resounded particularly in provinces in which there were already splits in the ANC structure, such as the Western Cape.
South African national convention and formation of new party.
The convention called by Lekota was held in Sandton on 1 November 2008. Originally planned for 4,000 delegates over two days, the conference eventually hosted over 5,000, with some people not able to get into the venue, and was shortened to one day to avoid inconvenience to those delegates who had nowhere to stay overnight.
The conference was attended by major political figures, including delegates from other political parties. The ANC did not send a delegation to the conference.
Following the conference Lekota announced that a new party would be formed on 16 December. In Western Cape municipal by-elections on 11 December 2008, COPE won 10 of 27 wards (with its candidates running as independents, as it was not yet registered); the ANC only won three wards, with twelve of its candidates disqualified due to missing the registration deadline. The DA won nine seats.
The party was formally launched at a three-day conference from 14 to 16 December 2008, at which Lekota was named president.
General election 2009.
The party faced its first general election in 2009. Their election manifesto was launched on 24 January 2009 and included calls for electoral reform to have the president, provincial premiers and municipal mayors directly elected. South Africa currently has a pure proportional representation system with parties submitting lists of candidates in order of preference. The president and provincial premiers and mayors (after municipal elections) are subsequently elected by the members of the relevant assembly.
On 20 February 2009, they announced clergyman Mvume Dandala as their presidential candidate. A COPE official was murdered in the Eastern Cape, and COPE supporters, from the Eastern Cape, were driven out of their shacks in Durban. The party achieved the leadership of the opposition in the legislatures of Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo and Northern Cape and representation in all nine provinces.
Leadership elected during 10 - 12 January 2014 First National Congress.
The elected leadership of the party consists of the following:
Provincial premiership candidates.
COPE's list of provincial premiership candidates was announced in the Sunday Sun newspaper on 2 March 2009. The list was:
The premiership candidate for Limpopo was announced at a later date:
Reactions.
Reaction from the ANC and alliance partners.
The ANC leadership reacted by offering a reconciliation meeting between treasurer Mathews Phosa and Lekota and his former deputy defense minister Mluleki George on 13 October. However, the meeting ended without resolution. On 14 October, Lekota and George were suspended from membership in the ANC by the National Executive Committee, with threats of suspension against any other members who sought to join Lekota and George. Both Zuma and then ANC Youth League president Julius Malema ridiculed Lekota for the announcement.
Support from within the ANC.
On 15 October, former Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa, who resigned from his position soon after Mbeki and the cabinet resigned, announced that he had resigned his membership from the ANC and thrown his support behind Lekota's convention, which he announced would be held on 2 November. The partnership between Lekota and Shilowa led the press to nickname the proposed new party "Shikota". Former Western Cape community safety minister Leonard Ramatlakane resigned from the ANC on 22 October to join Lekota's initiative. On 3 November, former Eastern Cape premier Nosimo Balindlela announced her resignation from the ANC in order to join the proposed new party.
On 13 November 2008, Smuts Ngonyama, the former head of communications for ANC, joined the breakaway movement.
Reaction from other parties.
Helen Zille of the Democratic Alliance, Bantu Holomisa of the United Democratic Movement and Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party all welcomed the announcement, saying that a new party in opposition to the ANC would diversify the political landscape and pull South Africa from being an effectively dominant-party system.
Prominent supporters.
COPE has attracted the support of a wide range of well-known South Africans from various sectors, including Sipho Ngwema, former head of communications for the Scorpions who is now the party's media liaison chief, and cleric Allan Boesak who ran in the 2009 election as COPE's Western Cape premier candidate. Other prominent supporters include the wife of Vusi Pikoli, the former head of the National Prosecuting Authority, and Simon Grindrod, former deputy president of the Independent Democrats.
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, former deputy president under Thabo Mbeki, and Saki Macozoma, a prominent South African billionnaire and close ally of Mbeki, joined COPE in late February 2009. Macozoma's affiliation to the party was accidentally leaked by Mbhazima Shilowa himself in London, United Kingdom, in the third week of January 2009 Mlambo-Ngcuka who is best known for her statement that South Africa could learn from Zimbabwe with regard to land reform.
Policy.
In an interview with "The Sunday Times", Lekota stated that the ideology of the party will be one that embraces multiracial and multicultural participation in governance, promoting of the free market and disavowed themselves from any connection to Marxism. He has also indicated that the party would be willing to ally itself with the Democratic Alliance, a historically liberal party, in the case that the DA ever enters government.
According to the party's manifesto flyer, COPE's campaign topics for the 2009 elections are maintaining the constitutional status quo, unemployment, job satisfaction, poverty, the environment, secondary and tertiary education, health care in general, crime, women empowerment, youth development, family values, and future non-racialism.
A main distinction between COPE and the ruling ANC party is that COPE favours a system in which top-level government officials are elected directly, by public election, and officials can only be removed by courts of justice, whereas the current situation in South Africa is that top-level government officials are appointed and can be removed from office by the political parties themselves.
Controversies.
Issues surrounding the name.
Before settling on the name "Congress of the People" and the abbreviation "COPE", several possible names were used or suggested by the party founders themselves and through speculation in the media.
During a public meeting on 12 October 2008 in Langa, where Lekota was the speaker, membership forms for a possible new party, bearing the name "African National Congress of South Africa (ANCSA)", were distributed.
On 31 October 2008, one day prior to the new party's convention in Sandton, the ANC made an urgent application to the high court to prevent the new party from using names such as "South Africa National Convention", "South Africa National Congress", "SANC" or any other name or trademark that is similar to its own. The judge ruled that the convention may go ahead, but did make a ruling on the names issue until 6 November.
At the new party's Sandton convention, the name "South African Democratic Congress (SADC)" was also proposed, but it was later discovered by them that this was already being used by another party that was due to contest the 2009 election.
By 15 November, the name "Congress of the People" was chosen, and its official abbreviation was chosen to be "COPE", not "COP".
When the name eventually settled on was the "Congress of the People", the ANC announced they would challenge this name as well. The ANC's application to the Pretoria Provincial Division of the High Court for an interdict to prevent COPE from using the name Congress of the People, cited that the ANC itself was affiliated to the 1955 Congress of the People, held in Kliptown. On 12 December 2008, the court ruled that COPE would not be barred from using its present name.
Allan Boesak.
The elevation of Boesak to the COPE leadership, given his record as a convicted malefactor, drew considerable censure from press and public alike. It was intimated that the party's self-projection as a morally pure alternative had been sullied. On 5 February 2009, on his Facebook page, Lekota urged supporters:
We should also not be distracted now by who serves in the interim leadership, because ultimately the people's voice will be heard. They will vote for their leaders, and everyone else will apply for a job and be interviewed to obtain any position. So, you see, I am not bothered by who joins COPE, or if the individual has a criminal record, or not. Is it not so, that if a gangster goes to church, he expects to dance to gospel music, not kwaito? He's fully aware of what music determines the song and dance in church. No-one is forced to join COPE – people join voluntarily, fully aware of what the organisation stands for. So, why worry about who joins? Let them; they'll dance to our music!
Infighting and court battles over leadership.
Following the 2009 elections, COPE experienced a leadership dispute between factions supporting Mosiuoa Lekota and others supporting Mbhazima Shilowathat led to a 2013 court battle [http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/shilowa-row-goes-back-to-court-1.1598059, and continued into 2014 [http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/01/07/cope-factions-headed-for-court-battle].

History of Sirhind

Sirhind is the older and more popular name of Fatehgarh Sahib. It is situated on the Delhi to Lahore Highway. It has a population of about 60,852. It is now a district headquarters in the state of Punjab; the name of the district is Fatehgarh Sahib.
Pre-Mughal Empire History.
The antiquity of the city is traceable to the beginning of the Christian era. It was a military outpost of Prithviraj Chauhan against Muhammad Ghori. In 1192 it became a part of Ghauri Sultanate after the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan. It was refounded by Emperor Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1361 AD at the behest of Sayyid Jalaluddin Bukhari, the spiritual guide of that King. He made it a new pargana by dividing the old fief of Samana. Firuz Shah dug a canal from the Sutlej. It was an important stronghold of Delhi Sultanate. In 1415 Khizr Khan the first Sayyid ruler of Delhi, nominated his son Malik Mubarak as a governor of Sirhind. in 1420 Khizr khan defeated insurgent Sarang Khan at Sirhind. In 1451 here, Bahlul Khan Lodhi assumed the title of Sultan under the governorship of Malik Sultan Shah Lodhi.
Under The Mughal Empire.
However it reached the zenith of its glory under the Mughal Empire in the seventeenth century. This city was a home of sixteenth-century saint Ahmad Sirhindi, popularly known as "Mujadid Alif Sani" which means 'Revivor of the Faith in the Second Millennium'. The mausoleum of this saint is still there. Under Akbar it had turned the highest yielding sarkar. Under Sirhind sarkar there were 28 parganas. Due to its prosperity during the Mughal Empire it was known as "Sirhind Bāvani" which means Sirhind Fifty-two because it yielded a revenue of 52 "lakh" Rs, i.e. 5 million 20 thousand Rs per year. Emperor Shah Jahan built a famous garden known as Aam khas Bagh.
Baba Banda Singh Bahadur and his Sikh army in 1710 destroyed the city of Sirhind completely,and Wazir Khan the governor, was killed. The Sikhs occupied Sirhind and made Bhai Baj Singh the governor.
Maratha conquest.
Adina Beg Khan, along with Sikhs was already in revolt with Ahmad Shah Abdali who had invaded Punjab multiple times. He asked Marathas for help, On 7 March, 1758, Marathas at that time were the paramount power in India, Maratha general, Raghunathrao had encamped at Rajpura where he received Adina Beg Khan’s envoys, and was informed that the latter, accompanied by Sikh militias, belonging to the bands of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and Ala Singh of Patiala had closed upon Sirhind from the other side of Satluj. A concerted attack on the fort of Sirhind was made by the Marathas on 8 March 1758. Ahmad Samad Khan, with his 10,000 Afghan troops, held out for about two weeks before his capitulation on 21 March. After the victory, the town was thoroughly sacked by the victors. After defeating the Afghan-Rohilla forces, the Marathas pursued the Afghans into the Punjab.
Sirhind and Sikhs.
Under the orders of the faujdar, Nawab Wazir Khan, Guru Gobind Singh`s two younger sons, aged nine and seven, were cruelly done to death.
They were enclosed alive in a wall in Sirhind and executed as the masonry rose up to their necks. Sirhind was for this reason the accurst city in the eyes of the Sikhs. Mobilized under the flag of Banda Singh Bahadur after the death of Guru Gobind Singh in November 1708, they made a fierce attack upon Sirhind. The Mughal army was routed and Wazir Khan killed in the battle of Chappar Chiri fought on 12 May 1710. Sirhind was occupied by the Sikhs two days later, and Bhai Baj Singh was appointed governor. The town was, however, taken again by the imperial forces.
The booty was donated for the repair and reconstruction of the sacred shrines at Amritsar demolished by Ahmad Shah. The territories of the Sirhind sarkar were divided among the leaders of the Dal Khalsa, but no one was willing to take the town of Sirhind where Guru Gobind Singh`s younger sons were subjected to a cruel fate. By a unanimous will it was made over to Buddha Singh, descendant of Bhai Bhagatu, who soon after (2 August 1764) transferred possession to Sardar Ala Singh, founder of the Patiala family. Sirhind thereafter remained part of the Patiala territory until the state lapsed in 1948.
Maharaja Karam Singh of Patiala (1813–45) had gurdwaras constructed in Sirhind in memory of the young martyrs and their grandmother, Mata Gujari. He changed the name of the nizamat or district from Sirhind to Fatehgarh Sahib, after the name of the principal gurdwara. Besides the Sikh shrines, Sirhind has an important Muslim monument Rauza Sharif Mujjadid Alf Sani, the mausoleum of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (1569-1624),the fundamentalist leader of the orthodox; Naqshbandi school of Sufism. There are a number of other tombs in the compound mostly of the members of Shaikh Ahmad`s house.

Round scad

The Round scad, "Decapterus punctatus", is a species of fish in the Carangidae. It was described in 1829 by the French zoologist, Georges Cuvier. Although the Round scad is considered a good food fish, it is mostly caught for use as bait.
Description.
The Round scad is a cigar-shaped fish, with greenish coloration on top and white below. Their opercles usually have a small, black spot. The Round scad has nine spines on its dorsal fin and 30 to 34 soft rays. Their anal fins have only three spines and 26–29 soft rays. Round scad often have a yellow stripe running from the head to the caudal peduncle. The longest Round scad recorded was 30 centimeters long, which is not far from the average estimated adult length of 12 inches (30.48 cm). It is claimed that the heaviest recorded specimen weighed 300 grams.
Distribution and habitat.
Known only from the Atlantic ocean, the Round scad is known from Nova Scotia in the north to Rio de Janeiro in the south, including the Caribbean sea and Gulf of Mexico on the western side. On the eastern side, they are known from Morocco in the north to South Africa in the south, including the islands of Madeira, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Ascension Island and St. Helena.
Round scad make their home in the ocean's Neritic zone and are also common near beaches. They are also known to gather near the bottom in large shoals. Round scad mostly eat copepods, but have also been known to eat pteropods, ostracods, and gastropod larvae.
Reproduction.
Round scad spawn year-round in waters well offshore. Their eggs float in pelagic waters before hatching.

Ice Challenger Expedition

The Ice Challenger Expedition was an expedition to the geographic South Pole. The expedition's six man team used a six wheel drive vehicle to cover about 1,000 miles.
Not to be confused with the "Ice Challenger" expedition to traverse the ice floes in the Bering Strait.
Expedition details.
In 2005 a team of six people took part in the Ice Challenger Expedition. Travelling in a specially designed six wheel drive vehicle, the team completed the journey from the Antarctic coast at Patriot Hills to the geographic South Pole in 69 hours. In doing so they easily beat the previous record of 24 days. They arrived at the South Pole on 12 December 2005.
The team members on that expedition were Andrew Regan, Jason De Carteret, Andrew Moon, Richard Griffiths, Gunnar Egilsson and Andrew Miles. 
The expedition hoped to show that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also more practical. It was also aimed at increasing awareness about global warming.
Further expeditions.
A second expedition led by Andrew Regan and Andrew Moon is departed in November 2010. The Moon-Regan Trans Antarctic Expedition traversed the entire continent, using 2 six wheel drive vehicles and a Bio-Inspired Ice Vehicle. The team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the Antarctic region and to show that bio-fuel can be a viable and environmentally friendly option.

Terra Nova (board game)

Terra Nova is an abstract strategy board game, where players control settlers dividing up a newly found plot of land. It was published by Winning Moves Games USA in 2006 as the third game in its Immortal Eyes line.
Gameplay.
The goal of the game is to earn the most points. Points are earned by sectioning off territories using stones and having the most settlers of your color in the enclosed territory. The game begins with player taking turns placing a number of their settlers onto various locations on the board (the number varies by number of players). Once all are played, the game begins. On a turn, a player has three actions to use. All three must be used if possible. The first action is always to move one of the player's settlers in one direction as many hexes as desired or until it hits another settler or stone. The second and third actions allow the player to either move the same or another settler or place a stone next to a recently moved settler. A territory is formed when an area is surrounded by stones and/or the outer edge of the board and contains 3 or less terrain types (the board has a number of different terrain types on it). When a territory is formed, it is scored immediately. The player with the most settlers in the territory gains points based on the number of hexes and the number of terrain types in the territory. For every hex, the player scores one point. The less terrain type there are in the territory, the player gains a multiplier of 1x, 2x, or 3x per hex for three types, two types, or one type of terrain. If there is a tie for most settlers, the players split the points. The game ends when either:
1) A player has no more pioneers on the board.
2) Only one player can move.
3) The entire board has been divided into territories.

Preston Deanery

Preston Deanery is a hamlet in the civil parish of Hackleton in South Northamptonshire, England. It is south of Northampton town centre and by road to the M1 London to Yorkshire motorway junction 15. It lies just off the B526 road (former A50) from Northampton to Newport Pagnell, between Hackleton and Wootton, a former village which has become now a suburb of Northampton.
Governance.
The village is represented on Hackleton parish council which also covers the nearby villages of Piddington and Horton. It is an "ancient parish"; a village or group of villages or hamlets and the adjacent lands which originally they held ecclesiastical functions, but from the 16th century onwards they also acquired civil roles. It was abolished as a separate parish in 1935. The 1801 census showed a population of 70. The current population estimate is 51.
Buildings.
Preston Deanery Hall and other houses.
Around 1940 Preston Deanery consisted of four semi-detached properties, half a dozen farms and Preston Deanery Hall, once inhabited by monks but since converted to a private residence. During the Second World War one of the houses was occupied by a boy and his mother, who worked as a domestic servant at the Hall. The boy went to school in Hackleton. His experiences are described on the BBC "People's War" website.
Preston Green.
Further urban expansion of Northampton was being planned in October 2008 with another 13,500 houses and additional infrastructure in the rural areas around Grange Park, Quinton and Preston Deanery however the incoming Conservative-LibDem coalition government of the 2010 General Election has abolished this expansion proposal.

Volkswagen Group MQB platform

The Volkswagen Group MQB platform is the company's strategy for shared modular construction of its transverse, front-engined, front-wheel drive automobiles. Beginning in 2012, Volkswagen Group has marketed the strategy under the code name MQB, which stands for "Modularer Querbaukasten", translating from German to "Modular Transversal Toolkit" or "Modular Transverse Matrix". MQB is one strategy within VW's overall MB (Modularer Baukasten or modular matrix) program which also includes the similar MLB strategy for vehicles with longitunal engine orientation.
While a model may be said to use an MQB platform, it is not so much a platform "per se", but rather a system for introducing rationality across disparate platforms that share engine orientation — regardless of model, vehicle size or brand. Thus MQB uses a core "matrix" of components across a wide variety of platforms — for example, sharing a common engine-mounting core for "all" drivetrains (e.g., gasoline, diesel, natural gas, hybrid and purely electric). As well as reducing weight, the concept allows diverse models, including those from the company's various brands, to be manufactured at the same plant, further saving cost. Ulrich Hackenberg, chief of Volkswagen’s Research and Development (Head of Audi Development since Summer 2013), called MB a "strategic weapon."
Jalopnik said "The biggest feature is the uniform position of all motors and transmissions" and that "by fitting all motors into the same place (the company) hope(s) to cut down on engineering costs and weight/complexity when porting the car over to other models." British magazine "Car" said "the idea heralds a return to basic principles of mass production in an industry where over the last 100 years, complexity has spiralled out of control. By creating a standardised, interchangeable set of parts from which to build a variety of cars, (the company) plans to cut the time taken to build a car by 30%."
MQB-based models.
MQB models may range from superminis to large family cars, replacing the current generations of models. The MQB architecture will supersede the current PQ25, PQ35 and PQ46 platforms.
All MQB cars will share the same front axle, pedal box and engine positioning, despite varying wheelbase, track and external dimensions.
Body styles; (1) 3-door hatchback (2) 4-door saloon (3) 5-door hatchback (4) 5-door coupe/liftback (sw) 5-door station wagon (c) convertible (r) roadster (mpv) 5-door MPV (x) 5-door SUV/Crossover (v) Panel van.

Chicago High School for the Arts

"The Chicago High School for the Arts" (ChiArts) offers a four-year college preparatory curriculum combined with intensive training in the performing and visual arts. A public high school open to all Chicago residents, ChiArts opened in the fall of 2009 with 150 freshmen divided among four arts areas: Dance, Music—Instrumental and Vocal, Theatre—divided into Acting and Musical Theatre, and Visual Arts. The program will add a fifth conservatory in 2014, Creative Writing.
ChiArts was previously located at the Douglas school campus for 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years, where ChiArts shared the campus with John J. Pershing West Middle School. It presently occupies the Doolittle West space at 521 East 35th Street in Bronzeville and shares the third floor with the James R. Doolittle, Jr. Elementary School next door.
Program.
Students participate in a rigorous program of academics and arts education.
Admission.
Entrance into the school is through a competitive audition and application process. Students may audition for dance (novice and advanced), theatre (acting, musical theatre), visual arts, music (instrumental and voice).
History.
In 2004, The Elizabeth Morse Charitable Trust and The Elizabeth Morse Genius Charitable Trust convened a group of approximately ten arts and education organizations to discuss the issue of diversity within mid- to large-sized arts organizations in Chicago and specifically the lack of representation in this landscape by professional artists representing the many ethnic communities who call Chicago home.
The Diversity Working Group (DWG) surveyed the Chicago landscape to identify existing educational resources for aspiring young artists across a broad age spectrum, keeping in mind the concentrated, focused training required to prepare young artists for professional careers. Incredible richness within the existing resources in Chicago’s many excellent privately funded community music schools, youth orchestras, university music programs and major cultural institutions was clear. What was not found was a public institution that would provide a comprehensive learning environment with superior training at the high school level – a critical stage in development for the aspiring young artist. This age group stood out as the one area of greatest need and also that with greatest potential for positive impact.
Once it was decided to pursue the idea of an arts high school, the group undertook conversations with key senior administrative members from Chicago Public Schools to assess receptivity and possible options for the creation of an exceptional arts-focused educational institution in Chicago. DWG members conducted site visits and/or spoke to officials at several public and private arts high schools in other cities.
At this time, Renaissance 2010 became an avenue for establishing new schools and offering students and parents a quality choice in education. Civic leaders were identified by the DWG members to help become the executive committee that would lead the project through the application process. The Chicago Board of Education approved the school on October 24, 2007. The executive committee became the founding board of directors of the school. Currently, there are 29 members of the board of directors. In 2008, after year-long competitive national search, the ChiArts board of directors named Jose Ochoa as the founding Executive and Artistic Director of the school. Instruction began on September 8, 2009.
Partnerships.
Numerous community arts programs, professional arts organizations and institutions of higher learning that specialize in the arts have come forward to join with ChiArts in making this type of educational experience available to Chicago residents through the public school system. Arts Partners include: Actors Gymnasium, Albany Park Theatre Project, American Theatre Company, About Face Theatre, Art Institute of Chicago, Art Resources in Teaching, Auditorium Theatre, Black Ensemble Theater, Chicago Arts Partership in Education (CAPE), Chicago Chamber Musicians, Chicago Children's Choir, Chicago College of Performing Arts/Roosevelt University, Chicago Multicultural Dance Center, Chicago Sinfonietta, Chicago Shakespeare Theater, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestras, Columbia College Chicago, Congo Square Theatre Company, Dance Works Chicago, DuSable Museum, Ensemble Español Center for Spanish Dance and Music, e Creative Arts Foundation, Goodman Theatre, Harris Theater, The House Theatre of Chicago, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Hyde Park Art Center, Hyde Park School of Dance, Hyde Park Suzuki Institute, Joel Hall Dancers & Center, Joffrey Ballet, Lifeline Theatre, Lookingglass Theatre, Lou Conte Dance Studio, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Marwen, Merit School of Music, Midwest Young Artists, Muntu Dance Theatre, Music Institute of Chicago, Music of the Baroque, National Museum of Mexican Art, Natya Dance Theatre, Pegasus Players, People’s Music School, Piven Theatre Workshop, Puerto Rican Arts Alliance, Ravinia Festival, Redmoon Theater, Remy Bumppo Theatre Company, River North Chicago Dance Company, Rock for Kids, Ruth Page Foundation, Sherwood Conservatory, Sones de Mexico Ensemble, Steppenwolf Theatre, The Theatre School at DePaul University, Thelonius Monk Institute, Urban Gateways, UIC- College of Architecture and the Arts, UIC- College of Education, VanderCook College of Music, Victory Gardens Theater

Camilla Martelli

Camilla Martelli ( – 30 May 1590) was the first lover and then second wife of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I de' Medici. She was the mother of Virginia de' Medici, future Duchess of Modena. 
Biography.
Born into one of the most important families of the Florentine patricians, Camilla was the daughter of Antonio Martelli and Elisabetta Soderini. After the death of Cosimo's first wife Eleonora of Toledo and after the end of his relationship with Eleonora of Albizi, Camilla became Cosimo's lover despite being 26 years his junior. Camilla stood by him during his old age, when because of his poor health he retired to private life in the villa di Castello, abdicating in favour of his son Francesco I de' Medici. 
Camilla had a daughter with Cosimo in 1568, Virginia, but she was always resented by the children from Cosimo's first marriage. Despite their opposition, Cosimo married Camilla in 1570, at the explicit order of Pope Pius V. However, the marriage was morganatic, and Camilla was not given the title "Grand Duchess." In response Francesco's complaints, Cosimo wrote, "I am a person and I have a wife in Florentine gentlewoman, and of good family," meaning that because he was no longer Grand Duke, he was free to choose his wife from any rank of society. Their daughter, Virginia, was legitimised and integrated into the Tuscan line of succession. 
Camilla was the main focus of bitter arguments between Cosimo and his children in his old age. They did not agree with her appetite for ostentatious luxury, which appeared vulgar in comparison to the tasteful elegance of his late wife Eleonora of Toledo. The Grand Duke, not to arouse scandal, went into seclusion and prohibited parties and official celebrations. 
In 1574 Cosimo I, who had suffered at least one stroke, had limited mobility and was unable to speak due to circulatory problems; he died on April 30. After his death, Camilla was forced to retire to the Florentine convent of Murate. She was later moved to the convent of Santa Monica. She was allowed to leave the convent only to attend the wedding of her daughter Virginia, on 6 February 1586, with Cesare d'Este, himself the natural son of Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. Eager to enjoy greater freedom after the death of Francesco I, she asked Grand Duke Ferdinando I to let her leave the convent. He granted her wish, but after a series of political crises, he forced her to return to Santa Monica, where she died in 1590.

Also in 1989, he was assigned responsibility for organization in the PCT Political Bureau and became the regime's second-ranking figure, under President Denis Sassou Nguesso. In the multiparty 1992 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as a PCT candidate.
After Sassou Nguesso returned to power in October 1997 at the end of the 1997 civil war, Lekoundzou was appointed as Minister of State for Reconstruction and Urban Development on 2 November 1997. After a little more than a year, he was instead appointed as Minister to the Presidency in charge of National Defense on 12 January 1999. In the May 2002 parliamentary election, Lekoundzou was elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Boundji constituency; he received 58.09% of the vote and won the seat in the first round. Following the election, Jacques-Yvon Ndolou was appointed to replace Lekoundzou as Minister to the Presidency in charge of National Defense on 18 August 2002; Ndolou succeeded Lekoundzou in that position on 21 August. Lekoundzou was then chosen as President of the Parliamentary Group of the Presidential Majority on 24 August 2002.
Factionalism and political activities in the 2000s.
Leading the conservative faction of the PCT, Lekoundzou opposed moves by the reformist faction in the party, led by PCT Secretary-General Ambroise Noumazalaye, to transform it into a broader party in the mid-2000s. In doing so, he was apparently also at odds with President Sassou Nguesso, who favored the reform initiative. Lekoundzou and his supporters dominated the PCT Central Committee, while Noumazalaye and his supporters dominated the Political Bureau; their differing visions for the future of the party produced an extended round of intra-party squabbling.
On 31 January 2006, Lekoundzou was flown to France for emergency medical treatment due to a "cerebral affliction", while one of his aides also fell ill; some suspected that they were victims of poisoning. Although it was widely believed that Lekoundzou would die, he survived and returned home to a hero's welcome later in 2006. His return initiated an escalation of the intra-party dispute; trying to gain the upper hand, Lekoundzou called for a party congress, and his faction held its own congress in October 2006. The situation was at least superficially resolved by December 2006, when a party congress involving both factions was held; Lekoundzou was elected to the Political Bureau, but the power of the conservatives in general was weakened. In an early 2007 interview, Sassou Nguesso said that Lekoundzou, who had been living in France for some months, was there for health reasons as far as he knew, not as a result of any bitterness between them.
Together with Jean-Pierre Thystère Tchicaya, the President of the National Assembly, Lekoundzou (who was still President of the Parliamentary Group of the Presidential Majority, but was out of the country due to illness) sent a letter to President Sassou Nguesso on 24 March 2007. In this letter, Lekoundzou and Tchicaya urged the establishment of an independent national electoral commission to oversee the 2007 parliamentary election. The members of the Presidential Majority Parliamentary Group were critical of the approach employed by Lekoundzou and Tchicaya, however.
Lekoundzou was still in France due to illness when the June 2007 parliamentary election was held, but he nevertheless stood for re-election to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Boundji constituency. Although he was unable to campaign, he was easily re-elected; he won his seat in the first round with 68.82% of the vote.
As part of his opposition to the "renovation" of the PCT, Lekoundzou founded the "Marien Ngouabi and Ethics" Association; this association has had a difficult relationship with the rest of the PCT and the authorities. The association's spokesman, Jean-Pierre Lokénia, was arrested on 6 May 2008, and in response, Lekoundzou—who was ill and being treated in Cotonou, Benin—said that he was considering returning to Congo to take Lokénia's place as a prisoner. His wife, Emilienne Lekoundzou, said that the association was founded only as a means of organizing PCT conservatives and was not hostile to the government; she also said that Lekoundzou had obtained Sassou Nguesso's approval before founding the association. On 17 May 2008, the association held its constitutive general assembly and elected Lekoundzou as Honorary President, entrusted with the guidance of the organization, while Marion Madzimba Ehouango was elected as its Executive President and Lekoundzou's wife was elected as Deputy Secretary-General.
