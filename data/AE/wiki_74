India–Kazakhstan relations

Indian–Kazakhstani relations are foreign relations between India and Kazakhstan. Diplomatic relations have increased in significance in the 21st century after initially remaining passive in the 1990s. Both nations seek to develop an extensive commercial and strategic partnership in the Central Asia region.
History.
India recognised the independence of Kazakhstan from the Soviet Union after the latter's dissolution in 1992, despite being one of the very closest friendly allies with the Soviets during much of the Cold war. In recent years, India has sought to increase its commerce and strategic ties with Kazakhstan, which is the largest nation of the former Soviet republics and occupies a major expanse of territory in Central Asia with extensive oil, natural gas and mineral reserves. India has sought to expand ties after mounting concern over the growth of the economic and strategic influence of the People's Republic of China. In 2002, Nursultan Nazarbayev made an official visit to India and in the same year, the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee attended the summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia in the Kazakhstan's former capital city, Almaty.
Development of bilateral relations.
As of 2003, Indian–Kazakhstani trade stands at USD 78.91 million. To bolster commerce, both nations have established the Indo-Kazakh Joint Business Council. Although India failed to acquire equity in the Kurmangazy oil field, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India is set to acquire a stake in the Satpayev field. The Kazakh national firm KazmunayGaz had offered the ONGC a choice between Satpayev and Makhambet fields and has asked for Indian participation in petrochemical industrial projects in the Atirau and Akhtau regions. Both nations have also sought to establish extensive collaboration and commerce in information technology, space research, banking and increasing volume of bilateral trade. India has offered Kazakhstan USD 1 billion in loans while the latter has granted major tax concessions to Indian companies. Kazakhstan has also sought to negotiate a multilateral agreement with Iran and Turkmenistan to create a transport corridor to India to ensure a reliable trade route and provide Kazakhstan commercial and shipping access to the warm water ports of India.
India is working towards the development of its civilian nuclear energy industry as a clean alternative to satisfy its huge energy needs. Since Kazakhstan has plenty of the uranium required for nuclear energy, India is developing a strong relationship with Kazakhstan. India invited the Kazakh President for the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi, in January 2009.
Strategic co-operation.
India and Kazakhstan have developed close collaboration in fighting religious terrorism an extremism, as well as in promoting regional security. A joint memorandum signed in December 2002 enabled joint projects such as training military officers, developing joint military-industrial projects and establishing a partnership between the defence industries of India and Kazakhstan. India has also provided support and emerged as a partner in Kazakhstan's bid to develop a naval fleet in the Caspian Sea, despite opposition from Kazakhstan's northern neighbour, Russia. The Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev visited India in January 2009 and a civil nuclear pact were made with India under which the uranium-rich Central Asian country will supply fuel to atomic plants in India.
Kazakhstan and TAPI.
India has broached the idea of a hydrocarbon pipeline with Kazakhstan that would bring fuel through a five-nation route. India unveiled the concept of the pipeline, which in future could be extended to Russia, during a meeting between External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid and his visiting Kazakh counterpart Erlan Idrissov here on Tuesday. The two Ministers will revisit the idea when they will meet twice in the coming months — first on the sidelines of the Istanbul process meeting on Afghanistan in Almaty and later during a stand-alone visit by Mr. Khurshid to the Kazakh capital of Astana.
The proposed pipeline would cover about 1,500 km (no study has yet been done), thus making it longer than the planned Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline which will serve as the role model. It will head from the former Silk Road caravanserai city of Shymkent, known today for oil refining, and enter Uzbekistan. From there it will go to Afghanistan and then follow the route to be taken by the TAPI pipeline into India via Pakistan. Officials said currently most hydrocarbon pipelines from Central Asia are on an east-west axis. This pipeline will, like TAPI, be on a north-south axis, providing a new route to South Asia for hydrocarbons extracted from Central Asia.

Sound Currency Association

The Sound Currency Association was a British pressure group formed in early 1920 as a result of a conference of bankers, traders and economists held in December 1919 to consider the financial outlook which seemed to observers to be particularly grave. 
The main purpose of the Association was to campaign for the concept of Sound money and to persuade the Treasury to contract gradually the issue of Treasury notes so they should once again have an equal value to the gold which they represented. This objective was achieved when Winston Churchill, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, returned Britain to the Gold Standard in 1925. The Association also campaigned for public awareness of the dangers of inflation and the need for monetary stability. Even after the return to the Gold Standard the Association continued as a pressure group for sound money until the decision to transfer the Treasury note issue to the Issue Department of the Bank of England.
The first president of the Sound Currency Association was Lord D’Abernon who was in office from the formation of the Association until his appointment as British Ambassador to Berlin in 1923. He was succeeded by Lord Beauchamp. Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Association throughout its whole existence was David Marshall Mason, Liberal MP for Coventry from 1910-18 and Edinburgh East from 1931-35. 
The Association was officially wound up at a special meeting of its executive committee in late December 1928 in a formal debate initiated by Sir Hugh Bell. Churchill was among those congratulating the Association on its work and achievements.

The Reserve Primary Fund was a large money market mutual fund.
On September 16, 2008, during the Global financial crisis of September–October, 2008, it lowered its share price below $1 ("breaking the buck") because of exposure to Lehman Brothers debt securities. This resulted in demands from investors to return their funds as the financial crisis mounted. Normally, the net asset value of money market funds is kept at $1. 
The Reserve had multiple other funds frozen because of this failure. It has liquidated a few funds, and post periodic updates about plans to liquidate other funds on their website.
As of October 27, 2009, more than $3.5 billion sat in the Primary fund, most in a special reserve held aside to be used for costs and expenses, including legal fees.
In November 2009, a U.S. district judge ordered the fund to make pro-rata distribution of almost all remaining assets to shareholders. As of July 2011, the fund had paid out 99.04% of its assets.

Dhenuka (pronounced dhēnukā) is a rāgam (musical scale) in Carnatic music (South Indian classical music). It is the 9th Melakarta rāgam in the 72 melakarta rāgam system of Carnatic music.
It is called Dhunibinnashadjam in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 3rd rāgam in the 2nd chakra "Netra". The mnemonic name is "Netra-Go". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra gi ma pa dha nu". Its structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras in Carnatic music" for details on below notation and terms):
As it is a melakarta rāgam, by definition it is a sampoorna rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the Suddha madhyamam equivalent of Shubhapantuvarali, which is the 45th melakarta.
Asampurna Melakarta.
Dhunibinnashadjam is the 9th "Melakarta" in the original list compiled by Venkatamakhin. The notes used in the scale are the same as "Dhenuka".
Janya Rāgams.
Dhenuka has a few janya rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See "List of Janya Rāgams" for full list of rāgams associated with Dhenuka.
Compositions.
There are a few common compositions set to Dhenuka, of which "TeliyalEru rAmA" composed by Tyagaraja is one of the most often rendered in concerts.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
Dhenuka's notes when shifted using Graha bhedam, yields 3 other Melakarta rāgams, namely, "Shanmukhapriya", "Chitrambari" and "Shoolini". Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the Shadjam to the next note in the rāgam.

Battle of Funkstown

The Second Battle of Funkstown (more commonly simply referred to as the Battle of Funkstown) took place near Funkstown, Maryland, on July 10, 1863, during the Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War. Union forces of the Army of the Potomac attacked the rear guard of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during its retreat from Pennsylvania following the Battle of Gettysburg.
A strong Confederate presence at Funkstown threatened any Union advance against Gen. Robert E. Lee’s position near Williamsport and the Potomac River as he retreated to Virginia after the Battle of Gettysburg. Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart’s cavalry, posted at Funkstown, posed a serious risk to the Federal right and rear if the Union army lunged west from Boonsboro. Stuart, meanwhile, determined to wage a spirited defense to ensure Lee time to complete fortifications protecting his army and his avenue of retreat.
As Brig. Gen. John Buford’s Federal cavalry division cautiously approached Funkstown via the National Road on Friday morning July 10, 1863, it encountered Stuart’s crescent-shaped, three-mile-long battle line. It was Stuart’s first defensive battle since reentering Maryland. The high ground constituted Stuart’s extreme right, held by Preston Chew’s horse artillery. A nearby stone barn and barnyard wall proved a superb defensive position for the 34th Virginia Battalion’s dismounted cavalry.
Col. Thomas C. Devin’s dismounted Union cavalry brigade attacked about 8:00 a.m. By mid-afternoon, with Buford’s cavalrymen running low on ammunition and gaining little ground, Col. Lewis A. Grant’s First Vermont Brigade of infantry arrived and jabbed at the Confederate center less than one mile away. Unbeknownst to the Vermonters, Gen. George T. Anderson’s Confederate brigade now faced them, the first time opposing infantry had clashed since the Battle of Gettysburg.
By early evening, the Union Army began withdrawing south towards Beaver Creek, where the Union I, VI, and XI Corps had concentrated. Stuart had kept the Federals at bay for yet another day.
The day-long battle east of the road resulted in 479 casualties. The Chaney house served as a hospital. At the Keller home, Confederate Major Henry D. McDaniel, later the governor of Georgia, survived his wounds. He would spend the rest of the war in a Union prisoner-of-war camp.
A smaller engagement took place near Funkstown on July 7, three days prior to the Battle of Funkstown.

Lyrical Meaning.
The lyrics concern a conversation between a young man and his older girlfriend, who is disappointed by his wild and hedonistic behaviour that night, and she drives him for 'tea and toast'. He flirts with her in the car, but she reminds him he's only young and needs to get his life together. He goes out again and chases another woman, but she disappears before he can make conversation. He muses about how she probably wasn't worth chasing before understanding his girlfriend's words.

Tu ne m'as pas laissé le temps

"Tu ne m'as pas laissé le temps" is a 1999 song recorded by French artist David Hallyday. It was the lead single from his album "Un Paradis / Un Enfer", released about two weeks after the single, in June 1999. Very moving, it was a smash hit in France (a number-one single) and Belgium (Wallonia) and remains to date David Hallyday's most successful single.
Song information.
The music was composed by the singer himself, while the lyrics were written by Lionel Florence, a famous composer who had previously worked with many artists such as Alain Chamfort, Faudel, Florent Pagny, Jane Birkin, Pascal Obispo and Patricia Kaas (later, it has also composed for Nolwenn Leroy, Natasha St-Pier and many others). The song is dedicated to Hallyday's grandfather and he addresses directly to him in the lyrics.
The song brings emotion "on a spontaneous mode which uses its most forceful sentences from the universe of the children : constructions inspired by the spoken language which break the semantic rules, idealistic oaths as much as solemn". The music seems to express both nostalgy and regrets, created by the guitar in the introduction and the violins in the refrains.
"Tu ne m'as pas laissé le temps" is also available on many French compilations, such as "Hit Connection - Best Of 1999", "Hit Express 8", "La Discothèque du XXè siècle", "Lionel Florence: des rencontres et des mots" (2002) and "Hits de diamant" (2007).
The song was awarded the Price Vincent Scotto by the SACEM.
In 2006, the song was covered by Chimène Badi, Liane Foly, Maurane and Yannick Noah. Their version was included as tenth track of the first CD on Les Enfoirés' album "Le Village des Enfoirés".
Chart performances.
In France, the song went to number eight on the SNEP singles chart, on 5 June 1999, three days after its release. It stayed for twenty consecutive weeks in the top ten, including a peak atop in the sixth week. Thereafter, the song almost did not stop to drop, first slowly, then quickly and remained in the top 50 for 29 weeks and in the top 100 for 30 weeks. The song is the 181st best-selling single of all time in France.
In Belgium (Wallonia), the single ranked on the Ultratop 40 for 26 weeks. It debuted at number 26 on 19 June 1999, climbed rather quickly and eventually peaked at number two on 7 August. The song managed to stayed for 16 weeks in the top seven, then dropped regularly.

Douglas Prasher

Douglas C. Prasher (born August 1951) is an American molecular biologist. He is known for his work to clone and sequence the genes for the photoprotein aequorin and green fluorescent protein (GFP) and for his proposal to use GFP as a tracer molecule.
Career.
Prasher received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the Ohio State University in 1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked in genetics and biochemistry research at the University of Georgia, where he identified the gene sequence for aequorin. He then joined the Biology Department of the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts where he studied bioluminescence. In 1988, he received a two-year, $200,000 grant from the American Cancer Society to clone the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), the protein that gives the jellyfish its glow. Prasher succeeded in this project, and later shared his findings with Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien after each scientist had communicated with him. In subsequent years, Prasher provided the clone to hundreds of scientists.
Reports that Prasher had difficulty in achieving fluorescence of GFP in other species in recombinant studies, were inaccurate. By the time Prasher's ACS funding ended, he had isolated only a partial "gfp" cDNA. It would require construction of another cDNA library during the following (non-funded) year for Prasher to isolate a full-length cDNA clone. By this time Prasher could not afford to devote limited resources to expression studies in "E. coli". It wasn't until the Nobel Prize announcement that it became clear how unfortunate this had been. Chalfie and Tsien went on to their successful expression studies. GFP has subsequently found application as a biochemical tracer such as in fluorescent studies on DNA.
Prasher had applied to the National Institutes of Health for funding but had been turned down, and by the time he was undergoing tenure review, he had decided to leave academia. Subsequently, Prasher worked for the Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service,[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/] U.S. Department of Agriculture at its Otis Plant Protection Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts as a population geneticist, and was later transferred to the Plant Germplasm Quarantine & Biotechnology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. After working conditions deteriorated at the Beltsville location, he went to work for NASA subcontractor AZ Technology in Huntsville, Alabama working on an existing project to develop lab-on-a-chip devices to monitor cabin environment and to perform human diagnostics during long-term spaceflight. However, he lost his job after 1.5 years when NASA reorganized and canceled the project.
On 8 October 2008, the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Osamu Shimomura, Chalfie, and Tsien for their work on GFP. Prasher was not included among the Nobel laureates, as only 3 individuals can share in a single Nobel Prize. Chalfie said of Prasher's contribution:
"(Douglas Prasher's) work was critical and essential for the work we did in our lab. They could've easily given the prize to Douglas and the other two and left me out."
Tsien also agreed that they couldn't have done it without Prasher and "Doug Prasher had a very important role."
In an October 9, 2008 phone interview with National Public Radio (NPR) and October 14, 2008 TV interview with Inside Edition, Prasher reported that he was unable to find a job in science, his life savings had run out and that he was working as a courtesy shuttle bus driver for a Toyota dealership in Huntsville, Alabama at $8.50 an hour. In the NPR broadcast, one of his former colleagues called Prasher's current situation a "staggering waste of talent." Prasher has stated his wish to resume a career in science, but not particularly with jellyfish. He has publicly expressed his pleasure at learning of the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Shimomura, Chalfie and Tsien:
"I'm really happy for them. I was really surprised that particular topic carried that much weight."
Chalfie and Tsien invited Prasher and his wife, Virginia Eckenrode, to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony, as their guests and at their expense. All three of the 2008 Chemistry laureates thanked Prasher in their speeches.
In June 2010, Prasher was finally able to return to science, working for Streamline Automation in Huntsville until December 2011, then from 2012 on, in Roger Tsien's lab at the University of California in San Diego

Rochelle Humes

Rochelle Eulah Eileen Humes (née Wiseman; born 21 March 1989) is a British singer and television presenter. She is best known for her work in pop groups S Club 8 and The Saturdays. Humes has achieved six Top 10 hits with S Club 8 and twelve Top 10 hits with girl group The Saturdays, including number-one hit "What About Us" (which was also the fastest selling single of 2013 at the time of release).
Early life.
Humes was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire. and attended Coopers' Company and Coborn School in Upminster, Havering, and also attended Colin's Performing Arts School. Her parents divorced when she was 3 years old and she was raised by her mother and her uncle Paul Ince. She has Sierra Leone descent from her estranged father and her mother is British.
Humes modelled for Love Me Love My Clothes (LMLC) and also took part in the Miss England contest, finishing in third place. In late October 2006, Humes was a member of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially.
Career.
2001–2005: S Club Juniors / S Club 8.
S Club Juniors were formed in 2001 through a reality TV show, known as S Club Search. The auditions were aired on CBBC. S Club Juniors' appearances was considered a success and consequently 19 Entertainment, the management company that had created S Club 7 and auditioned S Club Juniors, decided they should perform as a support act at all of the venues on the tour. By the end of the tour, S Club Juniors had created a following and, with the encouragement of 19, Polydor Records signed the group. Their first single was called "One Step Closer". The single was promoted by the TV series "S Club Junior: The Story" and was released in the UK on 22 April 2002 in a chart battle with the Sugababes who released their comeback single the same day. A second single was named "Automatic High", filmed in Spain, while S Club 7 began their fourth TV series. Released on 22 July 2002, the single reached number two in the UK charts selling 52,000 copies, and spent eight weeks inside the UK top 75 and sold in excess of 110,000 copies in the UK. Their third single "New Direction" released on 7 October reached number two in the UK charts selling 55,000 copies in the first week. It became their third consecutive top ten hit, selling 130,000 copies in six weeks. The Juniors released their debut album "Together" on 21 October reaching number five in its first week of sale and selling 40,000 copies. Their fourth single, "Puppy Love/Sleigh Ride", was released on 9 December 2002. The single debuted at number six in the UK charts, and sold 85,000 copies in the UK, spending eight weeks inside the UK Top 40.
The Juniors began work on their second album in January 2003. The band joined S Club on their S Club United tour in April 2003 where the announcement came of a name changed to S Club 8 and an upbeat fifth single, "Fool No More". The single released on 30 June reached number four in the UK chart, selling 26,000 copies in its first week and overall 75,000 copies in the UK. A second single, "Sundown", was released in the UK on 29 September 2003 reaching number four in the UK and became their sixth and final top ten hit and selling 37,000 copies in its first week and 80,000 altogether. The album, "Sundown", was released on 13 October 2003 to dismal reviews. It reached number 13 in the UK charts falling to 40 in the second week. It sold 60,000 copies in the UK and 315,859 worldwide. A sixth single, "Don't Tell Me You're Sorry", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003 and reached number 11 in the UK, becoming their first single to chart outside the top ten.
S Club 8 went on to "I Dream" for 19 Entertainment because they had already agreed to do it. Unlike the "S Club 7" shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, "I Dream" saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. "I Dream" revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by Christopher Lloyd), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.
2007–present: The Saturdays.
Since 2007, Humes is a member of the girl group The Saturdays, whose other members are Una Healy, Mollie King, Vanessa White, and fellow former-S Club 8 member Frankie Sandford. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with "If This Is Love", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, its follow-up single "Up" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the UK Singles Chart, to date the single has sold over 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks. The bands debut studio album, "Chasing Lights" (2008) reached the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and then receiving a Platinum selling status by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album also saw release from top ten singles on the UK Singles Chart—"Issues" and "Just Can't Get Enough". "Work" was the final single to be released from "Chasing Lights". "Wordshaker" (2009) was the bands follow-up studio album and also charted within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and went onto gain a Silver selling status, with singles "Forever Is Over" and "Ego" charting within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. "Headlines!" (2010) was released as the bands first Mini album and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the Irish Album Chart. "Headlines!" saw release of top ten singles "Missing You" and "Higher" which features guest vocals from Flo Rida, both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with "Higher" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart. The Saturdays third studio album, "On Your Radar" (2011) contained three highly successful selling singles and two of which—"Notorious" and "All Fired Up" charted within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. "My Heart Takes Over" was also released from "On Your Radar".
The band released another extended play, "Chasing The Saturdays" which was only released in North America. The band's fourth studio album, "Living for the Weekend" saw the release of the singles; "30 Days", "What About Us", "Gentleman" and "Disco Love". "30 Days" became the group's eleventh top-ten hit, whilst "What About Us" featuring Sean Paul saw The Saturdays earn their first number-one single in 2013, it is taken from their forthcoming fourth studio album, "Living for the Weekend". The album's fourth single, "Disco Love" became their thirteenth top 10 single.

In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on the BBC Two quiz show "Never Mind The Buzzcocks" as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a lineup of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of Bill Bailey, Russell Howard and Romeo Stodart (from the band The Magic Numbers), correctly picked Humes from the lineup. On 22 October 2009, Humes returned to appear as a guest on "Never Mind the Buzzcocks" on Phill Jupitus' team.
Humes appeared on British comedy film Big Fat Gypsy Gangster in 2010 alongside Tulisa Contostavlos as part of fictional girl group "Double Delicious". The role marked her film role, however, it was released straight-to-DVD and did not receive a cinema release.

The Sky Is Falling (Pearson novel)

The Sky is Falling is a young adult novel written by Kit Pearson in 1989. It is the first novel in the "Guests of War" trilogy, which follows the lives of Norah and Gavin Stoakes after they are evacuated from England to Canada during World War II.
The novel won the Canadian Library Association Book of the Year Award for Children and the Geoffrey Bilson Award (for best Canadian work of historical fiction written for youth).
Plot summary.
Norah and Gavin Stoakes live in a peaceful English village until WWII causes them to be evacuated to Toronto. Norah, an independent ten year old, is angry with the evacuation and resents having to care for Gavin. Five-year-old Gavin does not understand the evacuation and is confused and frightened. When they arrive in Canada, Norah and Gavin are placed with Florence Ogilvie, a bossy and cold widow and her timid spinster daughter, Mary. The Ogilvies only wanted Gavin but were convinced to take Norah as well. Norah is acutely aware of their preference toward Gavin, rather than her. While Gavin quickly settles into his new home where he is spoilt and coddled by Florence, Norah cannot settle. She dislikes Florence, is bored in her strict new home, is unpopular at her new school, begins to wet the bed (something she was very angry at Gavin for doing on the boat), and constantly worries about what is happening to her family in England.
As weeks go by, Norah’s resentment of Florence increases. Although she begins to make new friends, her misery increases as she realizes she cannot return to England for much longer than she originally thought. After Florence and Norah have an argument, Norah decides to run away and return to England on her own. She originally leaves without Gavin but decides she cannot leave him to be spoilt by Florence in a foreign country. She takes him with her but they only get as far as the train station before Norah realizes her plan is impossible. They return to the Ogilvies, expecting punishment but find that Florence and Mary have been very worried. Florence apologizes for ignoring Norah in the past months and asks if they can begin again. Norah accepts the offer and attempts to try live happily in Canada. Life begins to improve and Norah accepts Canada as her temporary home for the duration of the war.
Title meaning.
The title of "The Sky is Falling" comes from a child's misinterpretation of the Blitz. Early in the novel, Norah and Gavin are listening to stories with other evacuees. The group hears the story of The Sky is Falling (Chicken Little), about a chicken who believed the sky was falling. A young evacuee states that is what was happening in England.

Minnesota 13

Minnesota 13 was the name given to the corn liquor moonshine distilled on many central Minnesota Stearns County farms. It became well known across America and Canada as "Minnesota 13", a premium quality twice distilled and properly aged whiskey, (said by many to taste remarkably like "Canadian Club"). One story says the name came from a producer who hand-lettered his labels because he was proud of his product. Minnesota 13 was the name of an open pollinated corn variety developed by the University of Minnesota and used in Stearns County because of its shorter growing season. Stearns County was populated predominantly by German and Polish Catholics at that time. Holdingford was considered the unofficial moonshine capital of Minnesota.
Eventually, Federal agents managed to sharply curtail the large-scale manufacturing of moonshine in Stearns County. They succeeded by burning barns and sheds and through various acts of intimidation. They exploited divisions within the community by using informers and they undermined the tip system by sharpening their raiding strategies. Increased surveillance and a bigger stick to punish in the form of Jones Law finally blunted community resistance.
However, while they managed to alter behavior, they failed to change beliefs. Stearns County had its revenge when it voted 4 to 1 for repeal of the hated 18th amendment to the US Constitution. A number of books on local history refer to Minnesota 13 and its importance of helping people through tough times. The only book on the subject is "Minnesota 13" Stearns County's 'Wet' Wild Prohibition Days by Elaine Davis published in 2007.

Transport Act 1985

The Transport Act 1985 was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. It introduced privatised and deregulated bus services throughout Great Britain. It was introduced by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher.
Content.
Privatisation and bus deregulation came into effect on 26 October 1986. Local authorities were required to transfer their municipally-owned bus services to separate companies, at arm's length from council control. Most of these companies have since been privatised, with the notable exception of Lothian Buses in Edinburgh; a few other municipal bus companies remain today. Deregulation was not applied to bus services in Greater London; instead, the Act brought about a system of franchised routes operated by private companies but managed by London Buses Ltd.

Yosef Lishansky

Yosef Lishansky (; 1890 – 16 December 1917) was a Jewish paramilitary and a spy for the British in Ottoman Palestine. Upon his arrival in Palestine, Lishansky sought to join HaShomer but, denied membership, he founded a rival organization, HaMagen. Several years later, he joined the Jewish espionage organization, Nili. Lishansky was wanted by the Ottomans for his activities and was betrayed by HaShomer when he sought refuge with them. He escaped capture several times, but was eventually caught and sentenced to death in Damascus.
Early life.
Lishansky was born near Kiev in the Russian Empire in 1890, to Eidel and Ya'akov Toviah. After most of his family was killed in a fire, he made Aliyah with his father (the year of Aliyah varies between 1891 and 1896). They settled with Yosef's brother, Israel, who was living in Metula. His father soon disappeared during a trip to Jerusalem, and Lishansky began living at his brother's home. Excelling in his studies, he was sent to a seminar in Jerusalem, but did not complete his educational studies due to financial difficulties. Instead, Yosef travelled to Egypt, where he managed an agricultural farm for two years and then returned to the Land of Israel. In 1910, he married Rivka Broshkovsky, and they had a daughter, Ivriya, and a son, Toviah.
Jewish defense organizations.
In 1912, Lishansky attempted to join the HaShomer organization. HaShomer required a trial period for all recruits, and Lishansky was sent to guard in Poria, Rishon LeZion, Ben Shemen and finally Menahemia. In February 1915, Lishansky's force killed the leader of an Arab gang that attacked the village. Because of HaShomer's policy of avoiding blood feuds with the Arabs, Lishansky was declined entry to the organization. This was later perceived simply as an excuse not to accept Lishansky, who was proficient in the use of weapons, horseback riding and Arabic. Israel Shochat, a leader of HaShomer, later wrote that Lishansky often demonstrated weakness, adventurism and boastfulness.
Lishansky then decided to form a rival organization, named HaMagen ("The Shield"), which included rejected HaShomer members. The group did not wish to directly compete with HaShomer, so they selected the southern Jewish villages, which were previously guarded by Arabs. Lishansky was chosen as the leader of the organization, and travelled to the south to negotiate with the villages. HaMagen replaced the Arab guards in Ruhama, Be'er Tuvia and Mazkeret Batya, and later Gedera. Despite a clause in HaMagen's charter preventing it from guarding villages formerly or presently guarded by HaShomer, the latter attempted and failed to disband HaMagen.
In January 1917, unknown by his HaMagen co-members, Lishansky left Egypt to focus on his activities in Nili. Ill will was created and led to the decline of HaMagen. Despite this, some HaMagen members joined Lishansky in Nili.
Nili activities and death.
Lishansky joined Nili in December 1915, when Avshalom Feinberg was arrested for espionage and held in Beersheba. Because he was active in the south, he was recruited by Feinberg to pass information to and from Sarah Aaronsohn, who was operating from Atlit. He did this by hiding notes in the loaves of bread passed to the prisoners. In January 1917, after Feinberg was released and sought to secretly travel to Egypt to meet with the British, he was accompanied by Lishansky, who had intimate knowledge of the area. On January 20, they were attacked by two Ottoman soldiers and a gang of Bedouin near Rafah, which left Feinberg dead and Lishansky wounded. Lishansky was left to die but managed to reach a British patrol that took him to a hospital in Port Said, where he met Aaron Aaronsohn on January 25, 1917, and told him about Feinberg's death. Because Lishansky was the only witness to the killing, rumors started circulating that he was the one who killed Feinberg for personal reasons, or because of a romance with Sarah Aaronsohn. They were disproved only after the Six-Day War, when Feinberg's remains were found and the Bedouin in the region interrogated.
Lishansky subsequently returned to Atlit, Nili's central base of operations, and shifted his entire focus on the organization. He was responsible for collecting espionage reports from Nili agents in the vicinity, and managing the finances funnelled from Egypt. In April 1917, Lishansky again travelled to Egypt, against the will of his superior, Aaron Aaronsohn. He returned in June and continued his activity in Nili.
In October 1917, while Lishansky was in Zikhron Ya'akov, the Ottoman authorities received information about Nili's activities by accidentally catching a homing pigeon with a message from Sarah Aaronsohn, and after capturing the Nili operative Na'aman Belkind, they found out about a cell in Zikhron. They encircled the village, capturing Sarah Aaronsohn, but Lishansky managed to escape, and became a fugitive with a price on his head. He met with HaShomer members carrying gold and accompanied them to Tel Adas. 
HaShomer, which was opposed to Lishansky's activities, nevertheless decided to hide him, although as pressure from the Turks increased, they held another meeting and this time decided to execute him and hand his body over to the authorities. 
He was led to a place near Metula on October 9, shot twice, and left for dead. However, he did not die and by the time the Turkish soldiers reached the area, he had escaped.
On October 17, Lishansky found refuge in Petah Tikva with friends of Aaron Aaronsohn's, but they were reluctant to hide him and after two days sent him on his way. He travelled south in hopes of crossing the border in the Sinai Peninsula and reaching British lines. On the night between October 19 and 20, Lishansky attempted to steal a camel from Bedouins in the Shephelah region. He was caught and turned over to the Ottoman authorities. The Ottomans held and interrogated him in Ramla and Jerusalem, and after ten days in Jerusalem he was moved to Damascus.
During his time in prison, Lishansky contacted the Yishuv and asked for funds to bribe his way out of incarceration. Meir Dizengoff, one of the leaders of Tel Aviv, denied funding not only to bribe Lishansky's way to freedom, but even for the succor he provided other prisoners including anti-Zionists, despite having received the money from Nili. Lishansky disclosed members of HaShomer to the Turks, and by some accounts members of Nili as well. He was sentenced to death by hanging, along with the fellow Nili member Na'aman Belkind (who complained of the sentence since he withheld nothing during interrogations). They were hanged in a public square in Damascus on December 16, 1917. On October 24, 1919, Lishansky and Belkind's bodies were transferred to a cemetery in Rishon LeZion, although less than 20 people attended the funeral as part of the anti-Nili sentiment in the Yishuv at the time. In August 1979, Lishansky's body was moved again in a state ceremony to Mount Herzl, near the grave of Avshalom Feinberg.
Public image.
Lishansky was generally seen in a negative light in the Yishuv, partly due to Nili's overall problematic image. Other factors included rumors about backstabbing Avshalom Feinberg, and unfavorable personality traits. His grave in Rishon LeZion was vandalized several times over the years, and in 1937, Habima Theatre ran a play portraying him in a negative light.
Lishansky's image underwent a slow transformation to the image of a national hero, along with the transformation of Nili's image in general. After Feinberg's burial site was found near Rafah after the Six-Day War and Lishansky's name was cleared, more Israelis began to view him positively, and a request was sent to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to move Lishansky's grave to Mount Herzl. The request was denied, although the struggle to improve his image resumed and gained strength after "The Revolution" of 1977, when the right-wing party, Likud, was elected to form a government for the first time. A movement called "The Public Committee for the Rehabilitation of Yosef Lishansky" was founded, including notable figures like Uri Zvi Greenberg and Rehavam Ze'evi. The movement succeeded in gaining recognition for Lishansky's activities in World War I, and the transfer of his remains in a state ceremony to Mount Herzl on August 8, 1979.

Vin Gonzales

Vin Gonzales is a fictional character, a supporting character of Spider-Man in Marvel Comics' main shared universe. He was the roommate of Peter Parker as well as Parker's first romantic rival since the retconing of his marriage to Mary Jane Watson in "." He is the younger brother of Michele Gonzales.
Fictional character biography.
Vin Gonzales, an NYPD officer, is currently the roommate of Peter Parker . When Peter was in search of roommate, Harry Osborn offered the idea of Vin, a friend of Lily and Carlie. He does not seem to trust Spider-Man. Vin seems to have a crush on Carlie Cooper. When the first rent arrives, Vin and Peter recently had an argument because of Peter's problems at the Daily Bugle. Vin thought that Peter still had his job as a photographer and Vin was giving Peter news tips. Peter decided not to tell Vin until he had found a job. Vin thought that Peter was playing him and that made Vin very angry.
His anger towards Spider-Man increased where Kraven's daughter Ana Tatiana Kravinoff had mistook him from Spider-Man, causing trouble for him by having Vin placed on suspension from his job and after he was captured, Vin had to be saved by the real Spider-man (who was wearing the costume of his fellow crime fighter Daredevil). Spider-Man then had to use a cover story by pretending he left a costume with Peter Parker to protect his identity which was actually intended to prevent Vin from suspecting that Spider-Man was Peter himself.
Later, Carlie Cooper found that a group of Spider-tracers were in the vicinity of Peter's and Vin's apartment. She goes over to investigate, only to discover a bag of spider-tracers under Vin's bed. Vin returns to get his key when Carlie reveals the bag and asks for explanation. Vin is unable to explain himself until his partner, Alan O'Neal, chastises him and slips that "we gave 'em to you to take care of". Vin later admitted to Carlie that he and Al were involved in a secret conspiracy with other policemen to turn public opinion against Spider-Man in a smear campaign by planting tracers on people already dead to hopefully put an end to Spider-Mans' vigilante activities. It was revealed that Vin was recruited into the group shortly after his rescue from Ana Kravinoff due to his continuing hatred for Spider-Man. A warrant is later put on both him and Carlie. He is captured and taken to Ryker's Island. At Ryker's Island, many criminals attack him for his status as a policeman, but Spider-Man rescues him and breaks him out of jail. Vin apologizes to Carlie, and proceeds to arrest the Sergeant. His sister, Michele Gonzales, who is an attorney, works out a plea deal for him, giving him six months in prison and a removal from the NYPD in exchange for the names of all the police involved.
Vin is later released and returns home turning a new leaf. However, at a going away party for Harry Osborn, Vin confronts Harry and reveals that he works for Norman Osborn and has a Green Goblin tattoo. He tells Harry that Norman is aware of the child's birth. Harry follows Vin and tasers and assaults him, saying he has no intention of letting Norman get close to his child.
Other versions.

In the MC2 Universe, Vin appeared within the pages of "Amazing Spider-Man Family" #4. He is partner with Carlie at the time she gave Peter the inspiration to work with the police, which he currently does within the pages of Spider-Girl.

Beck v. Ohio

Beck v. Ohio, , is a United States Supreme Court decision holding that the police arrested the defendant without probable cause, and therefore the evidence found on his person after taking him to the police station were found as part of an unconstitutional search.
Facts.
A tip was given by an informant to a Cleveland, Ohio police officer in reference to William Beck driving on city streets. Without a warrant, the officer placed Beck under arrest and searched his car. Nothing was found in the car. Beck was transported to the car where a search of his person was conducted. During the search of his person, several gambling-related slips were found, which was a violation of Ohio Law.
The conviction was upheld by both the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court, that even though the searches were done without a warrant the searches were part of a lawful arrest.
Question.
Did the police officer arrest and search of William Beck violate Beck's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment? 
Holding.
The court overturned the Ohio Supreme Court ruling. "The record in this case does not contain a single objective fact to support a belief by the officers that the petitioner was engaged in criminal activity at the time they arrested him." Justice Potter Stewart further noted that, "We may assume that the officers acted in good faith. But good faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough. If subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, only in the discretion of the police."

Baptist Centre

The Baptist Centre is a building which houses the Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland (ABC), its departments (Baptist Missions, Baptist Women, Baptist Youth, and others) and the Baptist Theological Centre which includes the Irish Baptist College (IBC), the Irish Baptist College Library and the Irish Baptist Historical Society Archives. 
Located at 19 Hillsborough Road outside Lisburn, it was built in 2003 and opened on 10 May 2003.
Role.
The building has an important role in the life of ABC and the community. The building is an example of a 21st-century multi purpose church centre and is visited by other denomination leaders regularly from across Europe. The centre is the largest Christian resource in Lisburn and is used by many evangelical churches in the area.
Building.
It is a 4,300 m2 (14,000 ft2) purpose built complex housing the training and administration facilities. It is situated just off the M1 motorway at Moira.
Baptist Theological Centre.
The Baptist Theological Centre makes up part of the Baptist Centre and contains the Irish Baptist College.
Future expansion.
The waste ground to the back of the centre provides ample space for expansion. The association and college continue to grow in size and plans are in place for future expansion for the "proposed extension to the Baptist Theological Centre, to provide additional library, archive, storage and study space" since 25 July 2008, application number 0738/F. It was passed on 6 October 2008.
Expansion plans for a new purpose built library complex where mothballed in 2009 due to IBC and ABC financial constraints. The decision is controversial among students, some IBC staff and Baptist Theological Centre users.
County dispute.
The Baptist Centre is in a situation in which it can be said that it is in three counties. Due to the Centre being in Moira, in County Down, it can be said that it is in County Down (used most frequently by ABCI and its departments). Due to its post town being Craigavon (the Centre's full address is "19, Hillsborough Road, Moira, CRAIGAVON, County Armagh BT67 0HG, UK" ) it can be said that it is in County Armagh. Due to the Centre's location within County Antrim, it can be correctly said that it is in County Antrim.

Archimede-class submarine

The "Archimede" class were a group of submarines built for the Italian Navy in the early 1930s. The boats fought in the Spanish Civil War (under nationalist flag) and in World War II. Under Spanish colors, these boats were known as the "General Mola" class, and remained in service until 1959.
Design.
The ships were designed by the firm Cavallini and were a partially double hulled design. They were an enlarged version of the with ballast tanks rearranged, greater range, fuel and torpedo capacity for ocean service. Like most of the later ocean-going submarines of the Italian navy, their deck armament consisting of two 100 mm guns was conceived to deal with armed merchantmen in surface combat. That was the case of the "Marcello" class submarine "Capellini", which between 5 and 14 January 1941 sank the British steamers "Shakespeare" and "Eumaeus" off Cabo Verde after a protracted gunfire action. Another example occurred when the "Torricelli" faced three British destroyers and a sloop while surfaced in the Red Sea. Before being sunk, the submarine hit the sloop and damaged the destroyer . "Khartoum" exploded near Perim after a torpedo fault set a fire that reached her magazines later that day. They also mounted two 13.2 mm anti-aircraft machine guns. The number of torpedoes was increased from 12 on the "Settembrini" class to 16.
Boats.
All boats were built by the shipyard of Franco Tosi at Taranto, between 1930 and 1934. 
"Torricelli" and "Archimede" took part of the Spanish Civil war under Italian flag since 1936, carrying out undercover operations. Eventually both submarines were secretly delivered to the Spanish rebel navy on April 1937.

Kaliotoxin

Kaliotoxin (KTX) inhibits potassium flux through the Kv1.3 voltage-gated potassium channel and calcium-activated potassium channels by physically blocking the channel-entrance and inducing a conformational change in the K+-selectivity filter of the channel.
Sources.
KTX is a neurotoxin derived from the scorpion Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus, which is found in the Middle East and North Africa. (Crest M et al.)
Chemistry.
Kaliotoxin is a 4-kDa polypeptide chain, containing 38 amino acids. The formula is C171H283N55O49S8. The sequence has a large homology with iberiotoxin from "Buthus tumulus", charybdotoxin from "Leiurus quinquestriatus" and noxiustoxin from "Centruroides noxius".
An Important site of the toxin is the K27 side chain (a lysine at place 27 of the protein sequence), which enters the pore and protrudes into the selectivity filter of the channel. (Lange A et al., Korukottu J et al.)
Target.
KTX binds to the Kv1.3 voltage-gated potassium channel and the Calcium-activated potassium channels (BK channels). (Lange A et al., Crest M et al., Zachariae U et al., Aiyar J et al.,) 
These channels control several regulating processes, including neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, smooth muscle contraction. (Wickenden A et al.) Kv1.3 channels also play a critical role in regulating the function of effector memory T cells, the subset implicated in many autoimmune disorders, and blockade of Kv1.3 channels by kaliotoxin ameliorates disease in rat models of multiple sclerosis and bone resorption due to periodontitis. (Beeton C et al., Valverde P et al., Cahalan and Chandy)
Mode of action.
The toxin binds to the external vestibule of the channel, and a critical lysine residue (K27), protrudes into the pore and plugs it (Aiyar J et al., 1995, 1996). The positively charged amino-group of the K27 chain fits into the selectivity filter near the G77 chain (Glycine) of the channel, causing a conformational change of the channels´ selectivity filter (Aiyar J et al., 1996). Thereby the hydrophobic groups of the K27 side chain replace water molecules in the entry region of the pore. So the pore is blocked by a direct plug into the pore region of the channel and a conformational change in the selectivity filter is induced. By determining the solution structure of kaliotoxin and related toxins, and by using complementary mutagenesis and electrostatic compliance, it was possible to determine the architecture of the toxin binding site at the outer vestibule of the Kv1.3 channel (Aiyar J et al., 1995, 1996). This vestibule is - 28-32 A wide at its outer margin, - 28-34 A wide at its base, and -4-8 A deep; the pore is 9-14 ~A wide at its external entrance and tapers to a width of 4-5 A at a depth of - 5-7 A from the vestibule (Aiyar J et al., 1995, 1996). These dimensions are remarkably similar to that of the outer vestibule of the KcsA bacterial channel that was determined by X-ray crystallography (Doyle et al., MacKinnon et al., Lange A et al., Catterall WA et al.)

O schöner Mai! ("Oh Lovely May!"), Op. 375, is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II. It features melodies from Strauss's fifth operetta, "Prinz Methusalem". The waltz was first performed in January 1877, with Eduard Strauss conducting. The principal waltz theme of this work is a quote from the Act 3 duet for Pulcinella and Methusalem (""O du, O du, me in Feldmarschall""), while the remaining melodies are taken from Acts 1 and 2, including the Act 1 Chorus and Ensemble, "O schöner Mai!".

John Pitcairn, Jr.

John Pitcairn, Jr. (January 10, 1841 – July 22, 1916) was a Scottish-born American industrialist. With just an elementary school education, Pitcairn rose through the ranks of the Pennsylvania railroad industry, and played a significant role in the creation of the modern oil and natural gas industries. He went on to found the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG Industries), an early industry innovator which quickly grew into the largest manufacturer of plate glass in the United States, and amassed one of the largest fortunes in the United States at the time.
Pitcairn was also the primary financial benefactor of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, a Christian church which follows the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, and was a major activist in the American anti-vaccination movement.
Early life.
Pitcairn was born on January 10, 1841 in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland to parents John Pitcairn, Sr. (1803 – 1884), a machinist, and Agnes McEwan (1803 - 1891), a housekeeper. He was one of six children resulting from the marriage, and also had two older half-siblings from his father's first marriage.
Pitcairn's parents had initially emigrated to America around 1835, and lived first in Brooklyn, New York, and then in Paterson, New Jersey, where Pitcairn' sister, Janet, was born. Meeting with a lack of financial success, they returned to Scotland a few years later. In 1846, however, the family emigrated again to America, this time with four new children, and settled in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where Pitcairn's uncle, Alexander Pitcairn, had started a woolens business. There, Pitcairn attended public school until dropping out at age 14 to pursue a career in the railroad.
Around 1849 Pitcairn and the rest of his family were baptized by David Powell, a reverend of the New Church.
Career.
Rail.
Pitcairn began his professional life at the age of 14, working as an office boy for the general superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Altoona. He soon learned telegraphy, and through that became friends with Andrew Carnegie. Pitcairn rapidly worked his way up through the railroad industry; first as Assistant to the Superintendent of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad, and next as Assistant to the Superintendent of the Philadelphia Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On February 22, 1861, during his tenure at the latter, Pitcairn was in charge of the train which carried President-elect Abraham Lincoln from Harrisburg to Philadelphia, "en route" to the inauguration in Washington, DC. Later, when the Confederate Army invaded Pennsylvania before the Battle of Antietam, Pitcairn and his brother Robert Pitcairn were dispatched by Colonel Thomas A. Scott, then Assistant Secretary of War, to Chambersburg, to head the train service for the government. Pitcairn next served as Assistant Superintendent of the Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and followed this with a stint as the Superintendent of the Middle Division of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. Finally, in 1869, he was appointed General Manager of the Oil Creek and Allegheny River Railway Company.
Energy.
Upon forming a partnership with J. J. Vandergrift of Pittsburgh and George V. Forman of Buffalo, Pitcairn resigned from his position of general manager to focus exclusively on the oil business. During this period, Pitcairn built the Imperial Refinery at Oil City, Pennsylvania, and was heavily involved with the production, refining, and pipeline transportation of oil. With Vandergrift, he built and controlled the first natural gas pipeline for manufacturing purposes, and had a controlling stake in the Natural Gas Company, Ltd., founded in the summer of 1875, and later to become the Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. Through these and other successful investments in energy, mining, and banking, Pitcairn substantially expanded his wealth.
Glass.
In 1883, Pitcairn teamed up with Captain John Baptiste Ford and several others to establish the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (PPG). Based in Creighton, Pennsylvania (about 20 miles north of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River), PPG soon became the United States' first commercially successful producer of high-quality, thick flat glass using the plate process. PPG was also the world's first plate glass plant to power its furnaces with locally-produced natural gas, an innovation which rapidly stimulated widespread industrial use of the cleaner-burning fuel.
PPG expanded quickly. By 1900, known as the "Glass Trust", it included 10 plants, had a 65 percent share of the U.S. plate glass market, and had become the nation's second largest producer of paint. Today, known as PPG Industries, the company is a multi-billion dollar, Fortune 500 corporation with 150 manufacturing locations around the world. It now produces coatings, glass, fiberglass, and chemicals.
Pitcairn served as a director of PPG from its start, its president from 1897 to 1905, and chairman of the board from 1894 until his death.
Magnate.
Pitcairn's interests and holdings were not limited to PPG; at the time of his death, he was also president of the C. H. Wheeler Manufacturing Company, the Pittsburgh Valve and Fittings Company, and the Loyal Hanna Coal and Coke Company, and a director of the Central National Bank of Philadelphia, the Columbia Chemical Company, the Michigan Chemical Company, the Natural Gas Company of West Virginia, and the Owosso Sugar Company.
Family.
Pitcairn was the brother of Pennsylvania railroad magnate Robert Pitcairn and consul-general Hugh Pitcairn.
In 1877, the already highly successful, 38-year-old Pitcairn met 21-year-old Gertrude Starkey (1855–1898). Two years later, he proposed marriage, but was gently turned down. Reputedly, Starkey's strong New Church beliefs about the ideal of marriage required her to conduct a close examination of the spiritual nature of her feelings for him. Undeterred by her rejection, Pitcairn continued to court Starkey for five more years. Finally she accepted, and they were married in 1884.
Following their marriage, the couple lived on Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, until the completion of the new family estate, Cairnwood, in 1895. Together they had six children, only four of whom survived infancy. These were: 
Religious philanthropy.
Pitcairn was an active member and benefactor of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, a branch of the New Church, which follows the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Pitcairn's financial largess enabled the founding of the Swedenborgian settlement at Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, the construction of the town's library, and the New Church's spectacular Bryn Athyn Cathedral. He also financed the construction of a new campus for the Academy of the New Church, a Swedenborgian learning center comprising a secondary school, a college, and a theological school. The campus was completed in 1911.
Anti-vaccination activism.
During the last ten years of his life, Pitcairn was highly active in the American anti-vaccination movement. On March 5, 1907, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he delivered an address to the Committee on Public Health and Sanitation of the Pennsylvania General Assembly criticizing vaccination.
He later sponsored the National Anti-Vaccination Conference, which, held in Philadelphia on October, 1908, led to the creation of the Anti-Vaccination League of America. When the League was organized later that month, Pitcairn was chosen to be its first president. In May, 1910, an article by Pitcairn entitled 'The Fallacy of Vaccination' was published in the Ladies Home Journal, a periodical with a readership of several million. On December 1, 1911, he was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor John K. Tener to the Pennsylvania State Vaccination Commission, which in accordance with the law mandating it, was to include as members two anti-vaccinationists as well as two pro-vaccinationists. Pitcairn subsequently authored a detailed report strongly opposing the Commission's pro-vaccination conclusions.
Later life and death.
Construction of Pitcairn's family estate, Cairnwood, was completed in 1895. His wife, Gertrude, died just a few years later, in 1898. Pitcairn never remarried. When asked why, he once responded, “I would no sooner remarry than if Gertrude were standing in the other room.”
Pitcairn remained quite active in his numerous business, philanthropy, and social activism capacities well into his seventies. Finally, in the fall of 1915, he suffered a bout of pneumonia, from which he never fully recovered. He died at Cairnwood on July 22, 1916.
In 2002, Cairnwood was entered onto the National Register of Historic Places.

Granitsa, Kyustendil Province

Granitsa (, pronounced ; also transliterated "Granica" or "Granitza") is a village in southwestern Bulgaria, part of Kyustendil Municipality, Kyustendil Province.
Granitsa lies in a hilly valley in the eastern Osogovo mountains. It is bisected by a ravine, the bed of a rivulet which goes almost dry in the summer and autumn. Granitsa includes several neighbourhoods: Yakimova, Dzhoneva, Gorchovska, Efendiyska and Antova. The village was first mentioned in Vladislav the Grammarian's account of 1448: ПРИ ВЄЛБОУЖДИ НА СЕЛѢ НѢКОТОРЄМИ ЖИВОУЩЄ, ГРАНИЦА ЖЄ ОУБО ТОМОУ ПРОЗВАНѤ ИМОУЩОУ. At the time, the sons of the local Bulgarian noble ("bolyarin") and later monk Jacob (Yakov) from Krupnik settled in Saint Luke's Monastery above Granitsa. The three brothers Joasaph (Yoasaf), David and Theophanes (Teofan) reconstructed the deserted and plundered Rila Monastery in 1453–1466. In 1469, they initiated the return of Saint John of Rila's remains from Veliko Tarnovo to the monastery. The village's name is derived from the dialectal word "granítsa", "a sort of branched oak", from the Bulgarian word "granka", "offshoot, offset".
Granitsa was also mentioned in Ottoman tax registers of 1576 as "Graniçe". In the 19th century, most of the land in the village was the property of Turkish (Liman Ağa, Daut Beg) and Jewish (Sari Bohor) farm owners from Kyustendil. Landmarks in and around the village include the Bulgarian National Revival-time Church of Saint Elijah (1856–1857) and the residential defensive tower known as the Granitski House (1856), both built by Master Milenko. The Granitsa Monastery of Saint Luke lies to the southwest and may date to the 10th century; reconstructed in 1948, it is a fully active Bulgarian Orthodox monastery. Also southwest of Granitsa are the ruins of the eponymous medieval fortress from the Second Bulgarian Empire, probably a defensive station on the Velbazhd-Štip road. Another landmark is the Venerable Beech Forest, a protected area established in 1995 and covering .
The village's football club is called Slavia and plays in the municipal amateur league. The local industry is represented by a branch of the Kyustendil winery. Wine production, vine and fruit growing are well developed. There is a regular bus link to the municipal and provincial capital.

John Andrew Jackson

John Andrew Rhodes Jackson was born on a Country plantation in Sumter County, South Carolina. His grandfather was a stolen slave from Africa. John Andrew's mother was named Betty and his father was known as Dr. Clavern, because of his ability to cure snake bites. John Andrew had five brothers and five sisters. Before he left the plantation, two brothers and two sisters were dead.
Early life.
Jackson had a bad relationship with his owner and mistress, as many slaves did, but often mentioned that his mistress hated him more than any other slave on the plantation. The reason for the mistress’s hatred toward John was that when John was about ten, he was playing with one of the mistresses children in the dirt. The two boys found an old hickory root and started to play with it. The mistress’s son started hitting John Andrew with the stick. When John asked the boy to stop; the boy continued to beat John until he was bloody. When John reached for the hickory root with a bloody hand, he smeared blood on the boy’s shirt. The little boy went to his mother and showed her the blood on his shirt. In return, the mistress whipped John and held her hatred for him and his family for the rest of the time she knew him.
John Andrew grew up surrounded by brutality. If he was not getting whipped, a friend or family member of his would be getting whipped. The plantation where John lived was overseen by a violent and unforgiving master. The slaves would wake up and work in the fields all day in the hot sun. The sun would burn lumps on their backs, and their bare feet would be torn and cracked by the end of the day. When the slaves did not obey their masters, they would be punished with 25-100 lashes. The brutal lumps obtained by the heat of the sun, combined with the lashes from the whip, were awful and painful. What little sleep the slaves did get was cherished. However rats would come in the middle of the night and chew on the slaves' feet. Since the slaves' feet were so torn up from working barefoot all day, they could not feel the rats eat through their feet. In the morning, their feet were in so much pain it was hard to work.
John Andrew’s first job was being a scarecrow in the corn fields. He would stand out from dusk until dawn everyday posing as a scarecrow in the hot Carolina air. When he got older he was ordered to manage the plow, but due to his lack of strength, he was unable to manage the plow correctly. If John Andrew ever dropped the plow his master would beat him until his back was covered in blood. Even though he was experiencing so much hardship, around this time, John fell in love with a girl named Louisa.
Master and Mistress.
John Andrew’s master was born in North Carolina and lived his young life as a Quaker. When the master was older, he moved to South Carolina and married a woman who had a few slaves. The master then set up a liquor store and had slaves steal cotton and bring it to him. In return, the slaves were rewarded with a quart of liquor, which was worth much less than the cotton the slaves stole for him. The method of stealing cotton in exchange for objects of less worth made many southern men rich. The master and his wife were then able to own more slaves and become even more rich.
The mistress was born and raised in South Carolina. She was a mean lady to everyone except her family. The mistress would not allow slaves to eat bran, meat, or any other foods that were considered luxurious. And she would often watch the slaves being beaten, as it was among one of her favorite pastimes.
Wife and Children.
Louisa lived in the plantation about a mile away. John and Louisa were unofficially married and had two children. John was prohibited from visiting his wife and children, but John would often sneak out and be with his wife and kids. When the master would find out, John would be whipped, but John persisted and continued to see his wife and children until his wife’s master moved to Georgia. John never saw his wife or children again. In 1846, after John Andrew was separated from his wife, he fled slavery. Later after he escaped to Canada, he remarried and had two more children with his second wife.
Escape.
As time progressed, the idea of freedom became more and more real. One day, John Andrew bought a pony from one of the slaves on a neighboring plantation. When the mistress found out, she threatened to have the pony killed, and asked two of her son-in-laws to get rid of it. Hearing of the jeopardy of his pony, John hid the pony until Christmas. On Christmas Day, John took his pony and rode off from his plantation never to see his mother or father again. As he rode off to Boston, he ran into many white people who asked where he was off, to where John would respond that he was on his way to his plantation. John made it to the Santé Fe River where he boarded a small ship that was being run by a black man. John and his pony were dropped near land, but had to struggle upstream in order to reach it. After almost drowning, John and his pony made it to shore.
Then, John heard about a special badge that all African Americans had to produce in order to prove they were allowed to be free. John, not having a badge, sold his pony to buy a cloak to hide from patrolmen. The cloak worked to his advantage till he was able to find a ship to Boston.
When John found a ship heading to Boston, he tried to board but the crewmen refused to let John on board. The crewmen were afraid that he was working for a white man and trying to set them up. After being refused passage, John hid in a five by three foot box that was loaded onto the ship and put in the lower levels. Eventually the crewmen found him and threatened to unload him on the next ship. There never was another ship, and John made it to Boston safely.
From Boston, John Andrew went on to settle in Salem, Massachusetts. Once settled, he sought to purchase his family members still enslaved. He sent a letter to inquire about his family, and shortly after it was received, a slave agent was sent to search for him. Jackson avoided capture and was assisted by Harriet Beecher Stowe, who gave him food, clothes, and five dollars. He left Salem for Canada.
Freedom.
In Salem, John was free but not safe. He worked as a leather tanner and part-time sawmill operator until the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law rekindled his fear of being returned to slavery. He escaped with help to Canada.
Once in Canada, John Andrew settled in Saint John, New Brunswick. He remarried legally and had more children.
Still seeking to purchase his family members in slavery, in 1857, he journeyed to Great Britain with his wife to solicit contributions. He lectured in Scotland and England with several others, including: David Guthrie, Rev. Thomas Candlish and Julia Griffiths.
John Andrew and his wife lived in London, England until after the American Civil War ended. Eventually they returned to live in South Carolina.
He never saw his mother, father, first wife, or children again, but his freedom was the beauty of his life, and he never regretted leaving his life of torture.

<doc id="19694023" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19694023" title="Software widget">
Software widget

A software widget is a relatively simple and easy to use software application made for one or more different software platforms. A desk accessory or applet is an example, in contrast with a more complex application such as a spreadsheet or word processor. Widgets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that don't monopolize the user's attention.
Types of widgets.
Because the term, and the coding practice, has been extant since at least the 1980s, it has been applied in a number of contexts.
A GUI widget is part of a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows a computer user to control and change the appearance of elements for operating a software application. In this context a widget may refer to a generic GUI element such as a check box, to an instance of that element, or to a customized collection of such elements used for a specific function or application (such as a dialog box for users to customize their computer screen appearances)
Disclosure widgets are specific types of widgets that may be hidden or expanded by computer users.
A desktop widget is a specialized GUI widget intended to run on a computer desktop for computer users to control simple utility functions such as clocks, messaging services, and calendars. A mobile widget is the comparable equivalent for mobile devices (i.e. smart phones).
A metawidget is a widget for controlling the operation of other widgets within a GUI.
A web widget is a portable application installed and executed, typically by non-expert webmasters on HTML-based web pages, to offer site visitors shopping, advertisements, videos, or other simple functionality from third party widget publishers.
A "widget application" is a third party application developed for an online social network platform, with the user interface or the entire application hosted by the network service. Social network companies such as Facebook and Myspace host these applications and provide them underlying platform services (such as display and storage of user-provided photos and other content, profile information about end users and communications features with other users) through special-purpose application programming interfaces. The term is used fairly loosely, in that many such applications are more complex internally and in operation than the simple applets that are called "widgets" in other contexts. The relationship between platform and developer is mutually beneficial, with the social network offering hardware and software infrastructure, and access to the social network's end user base, and with application publishers ranging from amateur developers to organized companies such as RockYou! and slide.com providing content and features that make the social network services more useful for their members. At present, there is no fee or payment between developers and social network platforms, and attempts to realize revenue from widgets (primarily advertising by the widget applications and sale of electronic commerce goods and services within the widgets) have been relatively unsuccessful.
A Widget toolkit is a set of programming tools that help developers design elements of a user interface.
Widget Engine.
The widget model in widget engines is attractive because of ease of development. Most of these widgets can be created with a few images and about 10 to several hundred lines of XML/JavaScript/VBScript source code. A single host software system, such as a web browser, runs all the loaded widgets. This allows several desktop widgets to be built sharing resources and code.
The term widget engine is not to be confused with that of a widget toolkit. Toolkits are used by GUI programmers, who combine several widgets to form a single application. A widget in a toolkit provides a single, low level interaction, and is prepared to communicate with other widgets in the toolkit. On the other hand, widget engines such as desktop widgets and web widgets are intended for end users. Desktop and web widgets are stand-alone, task-oriented applications which can be composed of several related interactions on its own. Each widget serves only a purpose that is usually addressed by the effort of one GUI widget in a full-scale application.
Types.
Desktop widgets.
Desktop widgets (commonly just called widgets) are interactive virtual tools that provide single-purpose services such as showing the user the latest news, the current weather, the time, a calendar, a dictionary, a map program, a calculator, desktop notes, photo viewers, or even a language translator, among other things.
Examples of widget engines include:
Originally, desk accessories were developed to provide a small degree of multitasking, but when real multitasking OSes became available, these were replaced by normal applications.
Widget draft standard.
On 9 November 2006, the Web Application Formats Working Group in W3C released the first public working draft of Widgets 1.0. The intention is to standardise some aspects of widgets. The Opera browser is the first client side widget engine to adopt this draft W3C standard. Apache Wookie (Incubating) is the first server side widget engine to adopt this W3C standard. Wookie is a server that manages widget instances and allows them to be embedded in web applications in addition to being provided for client devices such as Opera.
Mobile widgets.
Most mobile widgets are like desktop widgets, but for a mobile phone. Mobile widgets can maximize screen space use and may be especially useful in placing live data-rich applications on the device idle-screen/home-screen/"phone-top". Several Java ME-based mobile widget engines exist, but the lack of standards-based APIs for Java to control the mobile device home-screen makes it harder for these engines to expose widgets on the phone-top. 
Several AJAX-based native widget platforms are also available for mobile devices.
The growing pervasiveness of mobile widgets is easily understood. While widgets are a convenience in the online world, they can be looked at as near-essential in the mobile world. The reason: the mobile device is small and the interface is often challenging. Wading through large amounts of information in a mobile environment is not just a nuisance; it is a near impossibility.
One of the biggest challenges of widget development is writing multiple sets of computer code so that a widget will be compatible with multiple operating systems and types of devices.
Companies considering new mobile widgets should evaluate and then deploy applications according to four criteria: the
business model, distribution model, server-side application framework and the run-time environment.
Many solutions are growing for mobile widgets. Among them the BONDI initiative within OMTP is trying to defragment these solution allowing the same widget to be run on different mobile phones allowing secure access to mobile phone capabilities.
Android, of all mobile operating systems, has supported mobile widgets natively since April 30, 2009.
Web widgets.
Web browsers can also be used as widget engine infrastructures. The web is an environment well suited to distribution of widgets, as it doesn't require explicit interaction from the user to install new code snippets. 
Web widgets have unleashed some commercial interest, due their perceived potential as a marketing channel, mainly because they provide interactivity and viral distribution through social networks. The first known web widget, Trivia Blitz, was introduced in 1997. It was a game applet offered by Uproar.com (the leading online game company from 2000 - 2001) that appeared on over 35,000 websites ranging from Geocities personal pages to CNN and Tower Records. When Uproar.com was acquired by Vivendi Universal in 2001, the widget was discontinued.
TV set widgets.
Widgets are also available for TV's.Yahoo! Widget Engine is announced as a component of the next generation TV sets.
Information flow of desktop widgets.
A desktop widget is a small footprint application, which resides on the user’s desktop using little desktop space and computer resources, such as HDD and RAM. Its purpose is to provide relevant information to the user in a non-intrusive manner and using few resources. Basically, desktop widgets enable the user to view on demand, encapsulated information from predetermined data sources. Ideally, a desktop widget must present personalized content, based on the user’s preferences. It is supposed to provide the most important information that a user requires on a day to day basis. Most of the desktop widgets are available as free downloads from the vendors’ Web sites.

Bulgarian government-in-exile

The Bulgarian National Government in Exile was a right-wing Bulgarian government-in-exile after the monarchist government of Bulgaria was deposed in a revolution on September 9, 1944, and was replaced by the Communist Fatherland Front, which later formed the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Government in Exile commanded Bulgarian armed forces operating in Germany and Austria. It was dissolved in 1945.
History.
Establishment.
On September 16, 1944, the right-wing leader Aleksandar Tsankov made a radio announcement stating that "The fight for the liberation of Bulgaria from the Jewish-Bolshevik yoke is in secure hands. The Bulgarian National government calls on fight against the oppressors of our motherland.".
The Bulgarian government-in-exile under Tsankov had no international recognition. In February 1945 the Bulgarian Government moved from Vienna to Altaussee and soon after dissolved.
After the Second World War Tsankov fled to Argentina and died in Belgrano, Buenos Aires, in 1959.

Cinema of Senegal

The cinema of Senegal is a relatively small film industry which experienced its prime from the 1960s through to the early 1980s, but has since declined to less than five feature films produced in the last ten years.
Cinematic history.
Early films: 1955-1969.
The first Senegalese film, Paulin Vieyra's "L’Afrique sur Seine", was produced in 1955. Vieyra would follow up with further short films "L’Afrique à Moscou" (1957), "Le Niger aujourd’hui" (1958), "Les présidents Senghor et Modibo Keita", "Avec les Africaines à Vienne" and ""Présence Africaine" à Rome" (1959) and "Indépendance du Cameroun, Togo, Congo, Madagascar" (1960), a documentary covering the independence of these countries.
However it was not until the Independence of Senegal itself that the industry began to develop. Writer Ousmane Sembène, became one of the country's leading directors during this period by turning many of his short stories into films. He was particularly concerned with social change, and saw film as a way of reaching a wider audience. In 1963, Sembène produced his first film, a 20 minute short called "Barom Sarret" (The Wagoner). The film is often considered the first film ever made in Africa by a Black African and illustrates the poverty stricken life that was still prevalent in Senegal after independence by following the daily routine of a cab driver. In 1964 he made another short entitled "Niaye". In 1966 he produced his first and Senegal's first feature film, "La Noire de...", based on one of his own short stories; and it also became the first feature film ever released by a sub-Saharan African director. Though only 60 minutes long, the French-language film won him the Prix Jean Vigo,
bringing immediate international attention to both film in Senegal and African cinema generally. Sembène followed this success with the 1968 "Mandabi", achieving his goal of producing a film in his native Wolof language.
1970s: "The Golden Years".
Through the 1970s the industry grew, with Sembène making a film in the Diola language and French entitled "Emitaï" in 1971. Director Djibril Diop Mambéty released a number of films during this period with deep social meaning and representation. Like many of his contemporaries, Djibril Diop Mambéty used the cinematic medium to comment on political and social conditions in Africa, and like Sembène his films were unconventional, surrealist, fast-paced, with social realist narratives. In his films, Mambéty confronted and engaged with complexities and contradictions in the emerging society in Senegal depicting hybridity. Djibril Diop Mambéty's earliest film, was a short entitled "Contras City" (1968), highlighting the contrasts of cosmopolitanism in Dakar's baroque architecture against the poverty-stricken areas. In 1970 Mambéty released his next short, "Badou Boy", another cynical insight at Senegal's capital which depicts a non-conformist individual against a heavily caricatured policeman who pursues the protagonist through comedically improbable scenarios. 
Mambéty's feature-length debut, "Touki Bouki" ("The Hyena's Journey") in 1973, in which commentators consider his most dynamic representation of hybridity and social isolation and juxtaposition in Senegal was made with a budget of $30,000, ironically partly funded by the Senegalese government. 
The film features lovers, Mory and Anta, who symbolically fantasize about fleeing Dakar for a romanticized France, representing the changing situation in Senegalese society and the transition to a new era. Of Mambéty's contribution to Senegalese film during this period, Sheila Petty, a scholar in African Studies notes, "unlike other African filmmakers of the late 1960s and early 1970s whose films were structured around essentialist nationalist discourse focused on the binary opposition of African values versus cultural alienation, Mambéty sought to expose the diversity of real life".
The film industry gained momentum in 1975 with the release of the acclaimed films "Kaddu Beykat", directed by Safi Faye and "Xala" also by Sembene. Sembene, funded by the American film company New Yorker Films produced "Xala", a black comedy which relates the story of El Hadji, an impotent politician in Senegal from the day of his marriage to his third wife. The film heavily satirizes corruption in African politics since independence with El Hadji's impotence symbolizing the failure of many of the governments to overcome greed. 
He followed this with "Ceddo" (1977), a film which received much censorship within Senegal due to its subject matter. 
Safi Faye, who first appeared in 1972 with her short film "La Passante" ("The Passerby") in which she also starred, was encouraged by French ethnologist and filmmaker Jean Rouch to use film making as an ethnographic tool and persuaded her to pursue an education in film production. She studied ethnology at the École pratique des hautes études and then at the Lumière Film School and raised money needed to produce films by accepting work as a model, an actor and in film sound effects. She received a PhD in ethnology from the University of Paris in 1979 and immediately began studying video production in Berlin. She obtained financial backing for "Kaddu Beykat" from the French Ministry of Cooperation and became the first feature film to be made by a Sub-Saharan African woman to be commercially distributed and gained international recognition. On its release however it was banned in Senegal. In 1976 it won the FIPRESCI Prize from the International Federation of Film Critics and the OCIC Award. She then released "Fad'jal" and "Goob na nu" in 1979.
Also in the 1970s, Ben Diogaye Bèye who was also a journalist, began filming a series of short films in Senegal. His first short film was "Les Princes Noirs de Saint Germain-des-Près", released in 1972, which is also his best known. It is a satire on a young and unemployed African trying to live differently in the French capital. His second film, "Samba Tali", was released in early 1975.
It received the Best Short Film Prize at the Festival International du Film de l'Ensemble Francophone in Geneva in 1975 and at the Carthage Festival in 1976.
1980s to present:The decline in film production.
By 1980 the country was producing five full length films a year and numerous short films. Bèye would produce and direct his first feature film, "Sey, Seyti", in 1980, which was a raised criticism of polygamy in Senegal. It was the runner up for the Best Screenplay Prize at a contest organized for the Francophone countries by the Agency for Technical and Cultural Cooperation. It received an honorable mention at the Locarno Film Festival and the Prix de la Commune Pan-African Film Festivals in 1980 and 1981 respectively. 
Safi Faye continued directing in the 1980s with "Man Sa Yay" in 1980 and "Les âmes au soleil" in 1981. In 1983, Faye directed the documentary film "" which follows a 39 year-old woman called Sélbe who works to support her eight children since her husband has left their village to look for work. Selbé regularly converses with Faye, who remains off-screen, and describes her relationship with her husband and daily life in the village.
Although she continued to direct films in the 1980s, with later releases such as"Racines noires" and "Elsie Haas, femme peintre et cinéaste d'Haiti" in 1985 and "Tesito" in 1989, her films, often because of controverisal subject matter from a domestic viewpoint, her films were shown in Europe and rarely being shown in Senegal or Africa.
After 1983 Senegalese cinema experienced a significant decline, partly due to lack of domestic funding. Directors such as Sembene were wealthy enough to continue making films, following on with "Camp de Thiaroye" (1987), and "Guelwaar" (1992) but the country lacked the domestic resources and finance needed to develop the industry and fulfill its potential. Even today in Senegal there are many cinematographers and people who have knowledge of film production, particularly in Dakar but have not the resources to develop the industry fully. Any films which have been produced since have almost entirely been financed from abroad and exhibited at international film festivals rather than in Senegal, which still has many cinemas standing from the golden era of the 1970s which by African standards are still advanced.
Sembène would, however, continue to direct several more feature films, but only due to the ongoing investment in his films by American film companies such as New Yorker Films. In 2000 he directed "Faat Kiné" which provided an important critical insight into modern, post-colonial Senegal and the role of women in that society. The film addresses themes of pregnancy out of wedlock and adultery and also examines the contrasts between the middle and lower classes and poverty with the uneven distribution of wealth and modernity, and struggles in values between past and present in Senegal. Sembène directed his final film in 2004 with his feature, "Moolaadé". It won awards at the Cannes Film Festival and the FESPACO Film Festival in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The film, set in a small African village in Burkina Faso, explored the controversial subject of Female circumcision.
Valerio Truffa is another of Senegal's most noted film directors, and he is the director of film schools elsewhere in Africa in countries such as Bénin and Madagascar. Amadou Tidiane Niagane is the director of cinematography for the Senegal Ministry of Culture.

China–Kazakhstan relations

The bilateral relations between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the People's Republic of China have assumed an important strategic role with expanding commercial and strategic cooperation between the two nations.
History.
The People's Republic of China and Kazakhstan formed diplomatic relations on January 3, 1992. The two nations signed their first boundary agreement in April 1994, a supplementary agreement in September, 1997, and their second supplementary boundary agreement in July 1998 to mark their shared border. In 1993, the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev made an official visit to Beijing at the invitation of the then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Since then, the leaders of China and Kazakhstan have frequently exchanged high-level official visits. In 1996, both nations became co-founders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Development of bilateral relations.
China and Kazakhstan have promoted a rapid expansion of commerce and partnership over economic development, especially in harnessing Kazakhstan's oil, natural gas, minerals and other major energy resources. Owing to rapidly expanding domestic energy needs, China has sought to obtain a leading role in cultivating and developing energy industries in Kazakhstan. Along with operating four smaller oil fields, the China National Petroleum Corporation in 2005 bought Petrokazakhstan, that was the former Soviet Union's largest independent oil company, for USD 4.18 billion and spent another USD 700 million on a pipeline that will take the oil to the Chinese border. Petrokazakhstan was the largest foreign purchase ever by a Chinese company.
In 2009 China lent $10 billion to Kazakhstan and gained a stake in MangistauMunaiGas.
On October 16th, 2013, the Kazakhstan Majilis and China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) signed a memorandum of understanding. The agreement is the most important legislations signed between the two nations that further bilateral relations. The legislation helps both parliaments meet together to discuss bilateral issues amongst one another.
Strategic cooperation.
Aimed at bolstering regional partnership on regional security, economic development and fighting terrorism and drug trafficking amongst Central Asian nations, Kazakhstan and China become co-founders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). In developing ties with China, Kazakhstan aims to balance the geopolitical and economic influence of its northern neighbour Russia. However, potential conflicts exist around China's cultural ties between the Kazakh people and the Uighurs of China's Xinjiang province, which could influence a Uighur separatist movement. China also aims to prevent the growth of U.S. influence in the region and the possible establishment of American air bases in Kazakhstan. In 1997, both nations signed an agreement to reduce the presence of military forces along the common border along with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.
Border agreements.
The origins of the border line between China and Kazakhstan go back to the mid-19th century, when the Russian empire was able to establish its control over the Lake Zaysan region. The establishment of the border between the Russian Empire and the Qing Empire, not too different from today's Sino-Kazakh border was provided for in the Convention of Peking of 1860; the actual border line pursuant to the convention was drawn by the Protocol of Chuguchak (1864), leaving Lake Zaysan on the Russian side. The Qing Empire's military presence in the Irtysh basin crumbled during the Dungan revolt (1862–77). After the fall of the rebellion and the reconquest of Xinjiang by Zuo Zongtang, the border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was further slightly readjusted, in Russia's favor, by the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881).
After the Xinhai Revolution and the Chinese Civil War and China and the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War in Russia, the Sino-Russian border became the PRC-USSR border. However, the Chinese and Soviet authorities were not always in agreement where the border line run on the ground, which led, in particular to a border conflict east of lake Zhalanashkol in August of 1969.
After Kazakhstan became an independent country, it negotiated a border treaty with China, which was signed in Almaty on April 26, 1994, and ratified by the Kazakh president on June 15, 1995. According to the treaty, a narrow strip of hills east of Zhalanashkol which the USSR and China had contested in 1969 have become recognized as part of China. 
To delineate certain small sections of the border more precisely, additional agreements were signed on 24 September 1997 and 4 July 1998. Over the next several years, the border was demarcated on the ground by joint commissions. According to the commissions protocols and maps, the two countries' border line is 1782.75 km long, including 1215.86 km of land border and 566.89 km of border line run along (or across) rivers or lakes. The commissions' work was documented by several joint protocols, finalized with the Protocol signed in Beijing on May 10, 2002.
Cross-border water management.
The two most important rivers of eastern Kazakhstan - the Irtysh and the Ili - flow from China. Their waters are extensively used for irrigation and urban water supply in both countries (in particular, via China's Irtysh–Karamay–Ürümqi Canal and Kazakhstan's Irtysh–Karaganda Canal). Besides, the Ili is the main source of water for Kazakhstan's Lake Balkhash, and the smaller Emil River, also flowing from China, supplies water to Kazakhstan's Lake Alakol. Accordingly, since the 1990s, the increasing use of the two transboundary rivers' water in China has been of concern for Kazakhstan's environmentalists and politicians.

Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City

The Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City is a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site in Liverpool, England. It comprises six locations in the city centre of Liverpool including the Pier Head, Albert Dock and William Brown Street, and includes many of the city's most famous landmarks.
UNESCO received the city council's nomination for the six sites in January 2003 and in September of that year sent ICOMOS representatives to carry out an evaluation on the eligibility for these areas to be given World Heritage Status. In March 2004 ICOMOS recommended that UNESCO inscribe the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City as a World Heritage Site.
The area was inscribed during the 28th session of the World Heritage Committee in 2004 under cultural criteria ii, iii and iv. Its inclusion by UNESCO was attributed to the fact that it was 'the supreme example of a commercial port at a time of Britain's greatest global influence'.
In 2012, the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the proposed construction of Liverpool Waters project. It is one of only two endangered World Heritage Sites in Europe (the second endangered site are Medieval Monuments in Kosovo).
Locations.
The Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City comprises six separate locations throughout the centre of the city, each of which relates to a different component and time in the Liverpool's maritime history. The inscripted sites extend for approximately 4 km north-south along the city's waterfront and stretch approximately 1 km east-west. In total it covers an area of 136 hectares.
The Pier Head.
The Pier Head is the focal point of Liverpool's waterfront and is dominated by three of its most recognisable landmarks: The Liver Building, The Port of Liverpool Building and the Cunard Building. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, they stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century when Liverpool was one of the most important ports in the world. Initially plans existed to add a 'fourth grace' to area, named "The Cloud" and designed by Will Alsop, however this fell through in 2004. Today, in what would have been its place, a new Museum of Liverpool opened on 19 July 2011. Behind the Port of Liverpool building is the art deco George's Dock Ventilation Tower, whose design is heavily influenced by Egyptian architectural styling. Also a part of the site is the old George's Dock wall, which dates from the late 18th century, as well as several memorials, including one built to honour the engineers who remained at their post as the RMS Titanic sank.
Listed Buildings
The Albert Dock.
The Albert Dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses located to the south of the Pier Head. Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick and opened in 1846, the Albert Dock warehouses were the first in the world to be entirely fireproof, due to their construction from only iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. The dock was home to many advances in docking technology including being the first to have hydraulic cranes. During World War II the buildings suffered significant damage and general docking decline in the city after the end of the war saw them fall rapidly into disrepair. In the 1980s the area underwent massive regeneration after the creation of the Merseyside Development Corporation and the complex was reopened to the public in 1984, as part of the tall ships festival. Today they form a focal point for tourism in the city, being home to Tate Liverpool, Merseyside Maritime Museum and The Beatles Story. They also constitute the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK.
Listed Buildings
The Stanley Dock Conservation Area.
The Stanley Dock Conservation area is located to the north of the Pier Head and includes huge swathes of Liverpool's docking heartland. Within the site are several docks including Stanley Dock, Collingwood Dock, Salisbury Dock and Clarence Graving Dock; parts of the Leeds Liverpool Canal and associated canal locks; and many smaller features such as bridges, bollards and capstans. Two of the Clarence Graving Docks are notable as the oldest docks still in use in the city today, dating back to 1830, although their full development wasn't completed until 1848. Amongst the buildings in the area are the Victoria Clock Tower and Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, one of the largest brick buildings in the world.
Listed Buildings
Duke Street Conservation Area/ Ropewalks.
The "Ropewalks" site comprises the south western component of the Duke Street conservation area, as well as two warehouses on College Lane and Bluecoat Chambers on School lane. The location was one of the first areas in the city to develop when Liverpool was an emerging port, with Bluecoat Chambers being the oldest surviving building in Liverpool city centre, dating back to 1715. Its proximity to the Old Dock, the world's first enclosed wet dock, meant it was the location of the city's first property speculators who built both warehousing and residential premises along Duke St, Hannover St, and Bold St. The area soon developed a cosmopolitan feel being home to various types of people including sea captains, merchants, traders and artisans. Today the area is known as Ropewalks, a reference to the large number of roperies present in the area when Liverpool was one of the busiest ports in the world during the 18th and 19th centuries.
Listed Buildings
The 'Commercial Quarter'/Castle Street Conservation Area.
This part of the WHS is focused around what would have previously been medieval Liverpool and includes Castle Street dominated by Trials Hotel at one end and the Town Hall at the other linking Old Hall Street by Exchange Flags, Victoria Street, Water Street and Dale Street. Today a centre for commercial activity in the city, the area was included due to the nature of its street development over three centuries and the grandeur of its architecture and monuments.
Listed Buildings
The 'Cultural Quarter'/ William Brown Street Conservation Area.
The William Brown street area is the central point for many of Liverpool's civic buildings forming a so-called 'cultural quarter'. Amongst the buildings that are focal to this part of the WHS are St George's Hall, Lime Street Station, the Walker Art Gallery, the World Museum Liverpool, the former Great North Western Hotel and the entrance the Queensway Tunnel.
Listed Buildings
Inscription.
Having received the nomination for the area in January 2003, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) travelled to Liverpool in September of that year to carry out an evaluation on behalf of UNESCO. The ICOMOS evaluation analysed the city in relation to its nomination document, looking at four key areas: conservation, authenticity and integrity, comparative evaluation and outstanding universal value.
Upon completion of their evaluation, ICOMOS returned to UNESCO with the recommendation that the area be inscribed as a world heritage site. At the same time they made several recommendations regarding future preservation and development within the areas and their buffer zones. As a result the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City was inscribed as a world heritage site at the 28th session of the World Heritage Committee in 2004, under the cultural criteria ii, iii and iv:

Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009

Cyprus participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. CyBC announced that Cyprus's 2009 Eurovision entry would be selected through a national final where the general public will be the one to decide the winner via 100% televoting. The national final was held on February 7, 2009.
Background.
Cyprus has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty-six times since its first entry in 1981. Its best placing was fifth, which it achieved three times: in 1982 with the song "Mono I Agapi" performed by Anna Vissi, in 1997 with "Mana Mou" performed by Hara and Andreas Constantinou, and 2004 with "Stronger Every Minute" performed by Lisa Andreas. Cyprus's least successful result was in 1986 when it placed last in 1986 with the song "Tora Zo" by Elpida, receiving only three points in total. However, its worst finish in terms of points received was when it placed second to last in 1999 with "Tha'nai Erotas" by Marlain Angelidou, receiving only two.
The Cypriot national broadcaster, Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) broadcasts the event in Cyprus each year and organizes the selection process for its entry. Selection processes have varied over the years from full national finals such as in 2004, 2006, and 2008, where the public chooses both the song and performer, to internal selections such as in 2005 and 2007 where the artist and sometimes song also is chosen by CyBC. For 2009, CyBC chose to hold a national final as it had the previous year.
National final.
The national final was held on February 7, 2009 at CyBC's "Studio 3" in Nicosia, Cyprus. The original selection date was set for January 31, 2009, but it was rumored to be changed to accommodate a possible guest appearance by Sakis Rouvas. The selection process was almost identical to that of 2008's. A submission deadline for songs was set for November 28, 2008 with the condition that writers be residents of Cyprus for at least two years. Cypriots, regardless of their country of residence, could also have submitted a song. The songs could be sung in any language, but they could not be submitted to multiple broadcasters in the contest. 
Out of all of the entries received, 20 were chosen originally and then a seven-member jury cut down the number of songs to ten which proceeded to the national final where the public chose the entrant completely by televoting. The seven member jury was drawn from a pot of fourteen suggested candidates and their identities will not be revealed throughout the duration of the final. In the case that the televoting system went down, the jury would have be used as an alternative to choose the entrant. The names of the ten finalist songs for the national final were announced on December 16, 2008, while the singer for each song was announced on January 20, 2009.
At Eurovision.
As Cyprus is not one of the "Big Four", nor the host of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, after Evdokia Kadi placed 15th in the second semi-final in 2008, Cyprus had to compete in the second semi-final to proceed onto the final in Moscow. Christina performed seventh in the semi-final on 14 May, following Norway and preceding Slovakia, however she failed to qualify Cyprus to the final for the fourth consecutive year.

Phänomene ("Phenomena"), opus 193, is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II. The waltz was dedicated to the technical students of the Vienna University, and was first performed on the occasion of their ball in the Sofienbad-Saal in February 1857. This composition belongs to the series of Strauss waltzes which reflect the composer's fascination for avant-garde orchestrations and harmonic styles of Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner.

Hakoah Tel Aviv F.C.

Hakoah Tel Aviv () was an Israeli football club based in Tel Aviv. In 1959 it merged with Maccabi Ramat Gan to form Hakoah Maccabi Ramat Gan.
History.
The club was founded in 1938 by a group of former Hakoah Vienna players who had immigrated to Palestine from Austria.
In the first post-independence season, the club played in the Tel Aviv Division of Liga Meuhedet. The following season, 1951-52 (there was no league football in the 1950-51 season) they were placed in the South Division of Liga Bet, finishing fourth. In 1954-55 they missed out on the league title by a point, finishing as runners-up to Maccabi Jaffa, who were promoted to the top division after play-offs. The following season Hakoah played Maccabi Jaffa in a promotion/relegation match, with Jaffa winning 4-1 on aggregate. The season after they also failed in the promotion/relegation play-offs.
At the end of the 1958-59 season, in which they finished third, the club merged with Maccabi Ramat Gan to form a new club, Hakoah Maccabi Ramat Gan. The new club played at Maccabi's Gali Gil stadium in Ramat Gan.

Chittlancherry

Chittlancherry (also known as Chittilamchery, Chittlamcherry, Chittilancherry, and Chittilamchery) is a village in the Palakkad district of Kerala. It is under the administration of the Melarcode Panchayath in the Alathur Taluk.
Description.
Chittilamchery is a quiet village containing several small ponds (including Aanaari kolam, Kakkatu kolam, Pathyila kolam, Choram kulam, Nochukulam, and Kappal Kulam) and surrounded by paddy fields. The presiding deity of Chittilamchery is Sri Cherunatturi Amma, or Sri Cherinattury Bhagavathy. Most of the villagers rely on agriculture as their primary source of income. Facilities, such as internet facilities and mobile tower communications, are gradually being developed. The village, located on the way to Pollachi, is a crucial junction for commuters. The village comes under the Melarcode Panchayath, while the block office is at Nemmara. The ponds in Chittilancheri need more care and restoration, as they dry out completely during the summer.
The village is mostly Hindu, but also has Muslims and Christians who actively participate in village activities such as Chittilamchery Vela, an annual event that takes place on the 28/29 April in honor of the presiding deity. Aarattu is also celebrated in the Sri Cherunatoori Bhagavathi Temple during a week at the end of January in which cultural programs, bhajanas and devotional songs are presented. Malma kali (porattan kali) is also practiced within the temple premises.
Other important temples are Swarganatha Temple, Arakunni Siva Temple and Tazhakottu Kavu. Important churches are Japamala Rani Church and Melarcode St. Antones Farona Church. Mosques are situated in Kaddampidi and Chittilamchery.
Kodiyamkad (formerly known as Odiyan kadu) in Chittilancheri has produced many outstanding teachers. There is a saying that the name Kodiyamkad was created because at one time it was a base for odians—people practising black magic. Women were advised to be careful while travelling when the odians were active. However, after being banned by the British government, this practice gradually ceased. Over time, odiaymkadu came to be known as Kodiyamkadu. The Valluthan Kavu in Kodiyamkad has recently been restored.
History.
The first school in Chittilamcherry was established in 1885 by Ramu Iyyer. March 15, 1965 saw the formation of the first Melarcode Panchayth presided over by T. N. Parameswaran.
Origin of the name.
The name is believed to be derived from "Chuttilam Chery", which means a place surrounded by "illams" (houses of Nambudiris).
Location.
Chittilamchery is just 4 kilometers away from Nenmara, which is famous for the "Nenmara-Vallangi Vela", and is 7 kilometers from Alathur Taluk. Its location, on the main road of the Pollachi-Thrissur bus route, makes this small village a busy junction.
Educational institutions.
MNKM Higher secondary school, founded in 1947, is the leading educational institution and the only higher secondary school in Chittilamchery. Other institutions in the area include AUP School and CNS Lower Primary English Medium School.
Facilities.
The main financial institutions in Chittilamchery are Canara Bank and Dhanlaxmi Bank. Dhanlaxmi Bank provides an ATM counter inside the branch office where Canara ban's ATM is in Chittilamchery junction. Other gold finance institutions are also available, like Muthoot Gold finance and New Gold finance. Friends Jewellery is one of the jewellery stores in Chittilamchery.
Noted residents.
Noted residents include high court justice M. N. Krishnan, Gopi Kallayil (Google Ad man), and Shashi Tharoor.

The Man from M.A.R.S. (1922 film)

The Man from M.A.R.S. is a 1922 silent U.S. science fiction film. It is notable for using the 3-D process called Teleview, similar to today's alternating frame 3-D systems. Shown in 3-D only at the Selwyn theater in New York City, it was previewed as Mars Calling at a trade and press screening on 13 October 1922, premiered as M.A.R.S. on 27 December 1922, and ran through 20 January 1923. A 2-D version was distributed as Radio-Mania in 1923-1924. The film was directed by Roy William Neil and photographed by George Folsey.
Both the 3-D and 2-D versions are now lost films.
Plot.
This curious picture is a cross between fantasy and science fiction (at least, the 1922 version of science fiction) and features Broadway actors Grant Mitchell and Margaret Irving in their motion picture debuts. Arthur Wyman (Mitchell) is the typical absent-minded scientist. He is in love with Mary Langdon (Irving), the daughter of his landlady (Gertrude Hillman). To help her out, he invents an alarm clock that does not tick (this being long before the days of electronic devices). Using the money he has earned writing an article, Wyman tries to put the finishing touches on a radio that will contact Mars. He falls asleep as he is tinkering with it and dreams that he has gotten in touch with the Martians. They give him a lot of valuable information—he learns a special way to make diamonds from coal, fashion gold from clay, and create steel that weighs "less than nothing." What he learns makes him fabulously wealthy—until, much to his disappointment, he wakes up. But then Mary arrives and tells him that the rights to the "tickless" alarm clock have been sold for a lot of money, so things work out after all.
Teleview.
Teleview was used for showing "The Man from M.A.R.S." at the Sewlyn Theatre in New York and then was never seen again. It was invented by Laurens Hammond, best known as the creator of the Hammond organ. Hammond had, in fact, earned money from the invention of a silent clock, which enabled him to establish himself as an inventor. Teleview was very complex for its time as it was a way to project and view stereoscopic images by the alternating frame method. Two projectors ran interlocked, with the left and right images being projected one after the other in repeated rapid succession. Each spectator had a special viewer attached to the arm rest of their chair. A revolving shutter in the viewer ran in synchronization with the projector shutters, blocking each eye's view of the images intended for the other eye, so that the users simply positioned the viewers in front of their eyes and looked through to see a stereoscopic 3-D image. Unlike earlier inventions based on the same principle, the Teleview system did not cause any unusual image flickering. The show was a success, but after several weeks at this one theater Teleview vanished without a trace.

Vojakkala

Vojakkala (officially Lower Vojakkala, ) is a smaller locality with about 62 inhabitants in Haparanda Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden, known for a long-standing feud between neighbors.
Local feud.
The community has gained attention from an infamous, long-lasting neighbor feud between a family of Romani descent and several neighbors since 1984. The feud has resulted in several hundred police reports and two convictions for attempted murder, the latest of which occurred in 2008.
The events have been documented by popular TV shows "Insider" and "Uppdrag granskning" in April 2007 and September 3, 2008, respectively. Earlier events have been documented by local and national newspapers and TV channels since mid-late 1980 and Swedish government have made efforts to solve the feud. The media focus has been on the Romani family as the main perpetrators.
In 2009, a renowned investigative journalist has implied that the family has been set up by anti-Romani factions of the local community and that they have played a great part in the conflict. He speculates that the family may have been the victim of prejudices and racism. However, in 2009, the Supreme Court of Sweden did not see any reason to overturn the ruling of the Appeals Court, which sentenced six persons to prison in connection with an attempted murder in 2008.

<doc id="19694541" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19694541" title="Stave bearing">
Stave bearing

A stave bearing is a simple journal bearing where a shaft rotates in a bearing housing. Rather than the usual arrangement where the fixed part of the bearing surrounds most of the circumference of the shaft in one or two pieces, a stave bearing uses a large number of axial staves to support the shaft. A large housing is made with grooves running along the shaft, these grooves being filled with strips of suitable material, originally wood.
Uses.
Stave bearings have long been associated with ships and their propeller shafts. The bearing is suitable for slow speeds and high loads. When used on ships, the bearing is designed to run immersed in water, allowing its use outboard of the stern gland or stuffing box. 
Stave bearings are also well suited to applications such as rudder shafts, where rotation is intermittent and reciprocating, rather than continuous and unidirectional. Other bearing types, such as some ball bearings, don't perform well under this type of use and may fail prematurely.
Materials.
The staves must resist the forces in the bearing and offer adequate lubrication from this water alone. They must also survive long-term immersion without rotting, softening or swelling. The historical material for this was the tropical hardwood timber, lignum vitae. In modern practice, Tufnol is often used. Recent developments in composites have seen polyester resin and phenolic resin composites such as ACM, Maritex and Orkot being used.
Nitrile rubber and UHMW-polyethylene have also been used. The tradename "Cutless" is a registered trademark owned by Duramax Marine. The name refers to a molded rubber bearing manufactured by Duramax Marine.The tradename "Cutless" is used for these rubber bearings and this name has also, along with its misspelling 'Cutlass', become a generic term for them.
Where used on small boats, the bearing is often moulded in one cylindrical piece of rubber, although the inner surface is grooved so that it still functions as a stave bearing. Although small, these rubber bearings are still capable of handling a high power, even a 2,350 hp record-breaker like "Bluebird K4".
The use of non-metallic bearing materials may also simplify problems with electrolytic corrosion between shaft and housing.
Cooling.
Although immersion alone is often sufficient to lubricate the bearing, additional cooling and also flushing away of any gritty particles that could cause damage may be achieved on large ships by a pumped flow of water to the inboard end of the bearing. This flow passes along grooves in the bearing surface, leading outboard. A low pressure of around 5 psi is adequate.

Conisterium

A conisterium (or conisterion) was an apartment in Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece gymnasiums. It was where sand or dust was stored, for use by wrestlers after they had been anointed with oil. They would either sprinkle it on themselves, or a slave would do it. The purpose of this was so that during a fight, the oil or sweat would not prevent a wrestler from having a good grip on his opponent. Conisteriums were also found in palaestras. After a fight, or exercise, the powder was rubbed off with strigils, before the wrestler had a bath.

Mastiglanis asopos

Mastiglanis asopos is a species of three-barbeled catfish. It is the only recognized species in its genus.
This species has a broad distribution, mainly throughout the left side tributaries of the Amazon basin and the Capim River basin in Brazil, as well as in the right tributaries of the Amazon basin in Brazil, Orinoco basin of Venezuela, and drainages in Guyana.
"M. asopos" is a strictly sand-dwelling species. It spends the daytime buried in the top layer of sand. It forages mostly at night and sometimes in the morning. As an ambush predator, when foraging, it poises in the streamlet channel where water is flowing, supported by a tripod formed by its pelvic and anal fins, spreading both its very long barbels and the filamentous dorsal and pectoral-fin rays, thus forming a kind of "drift-trap". When the fish intercepts food, it will lunge at these food particles; after lunging for a short distance, it will return to its previous hunting spot. This behavior is similar to that seen in the tripod fish. Small trichopteran larvae (ingested with the sand cases) and ephemeropterans constituted a considerable portion of the gut contents in a study of "Mastiglanis asopos", but their foraging behavior allows a varied diet which includes large chironomid larvae and small adult beetles that would not be consumed by other sand-dwelling animals.
"M. asopos" grows to SL. This fish has long barbels and long first pectoral fin rays which are used for feeding. It also has an acuminate (tapered to a point) snout.

<doc id="19694889" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19694889" title="Arizona v. Gant">
Arizona v. Gant

Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332 (2009), was a United States Supreme Court decision holding that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires law enforcement officers to demonstrate an actual and continuing threat to their safety posed by an arrestee, or a need to preserve evidence related to the crime of arrest from tampering by the arrestee, in order to justify a warrantless vehicular search incident to arrest conducted after the vehicle's recent occupants have been arrested and secured.
Facts.
The case involved Rodney J. Gant, who was arrested by Tucson, Arizona, police and charged with driving on a suspended driver’s license. Police arrested Gant in a friend's yard after he had parked his vehicle and was walking away. Gant and all other suspects on the scene were then secured in police patrol cars. The officers then searched Gant's vehicle. After finding a weapon and a bag of cocaine, they also charged him with possession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia.
Blurring the "Belton" bright line.
Thomas Frank Jacobs (Tucson, Arizona), lead counsel for Rodney Gant, argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court on October 7, 2008. Jacobs argued that an unreasonable expansion of a limited authority to search vehicles incident to arrest provided by the Supreme Court's 1981 decision in "New York v. Belton" was occurring. Lower courts were allowing searches after the initial justifications for setting aside the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement had ceased to exist, relying on a so-called bright-line rule of "if arrest, then search." Jacobs argued, and the Court ultimately agreed, that such application of the "Belton" exception caused the exception to "swallow the rule," allowing unconstitutional searches.
Scholarly interest.
A group of legal scholars, including University of Iowa law professor James Tomkovicz, wrote an "amicus curiae" brief asking the court to overturn the 1981 case, "New York v. Belton", that granted police the authority to search a person's vehicle even if that person is not in the vehicle. According to Tomkovicz, "Belton" fails to meet the constitutional standard of probable cause.
Supreme Court decision.
In an opinion delivered by Justice Stevens, the Supreme Court held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle, incident to a recent occupant's arrest (and therefore without a warrant) only if it is reasonable to believe that the arrestee might access the vehicle at the time of the search, or that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.
Justice Scalia wrote a concurring opinion, stating that "we should simply abandon the "Belton-Thornton" charade of officer safety and overrule those cases. I would hold that a vehicle search incident to arrest is "ipso facto" 'reasonable' only when the object of the search is evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made, or of another crime that the officer has probable cause to believe occurred."
Justice Alito wrote a dissent joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer in part, saying that the court could not overrule "New York v. Belton" and "Thornton v. United States", 541 U. S. 615 (2004).
Justice Breyer wrote a separate dissent.

Umbrella Cover Museum

The Umbrella Cover Museum in Peaks Island, Maine, is a museum that pays tribute to umbrella covers. The museum was created and is curated by Nancy 3. Hoffman, who has collected more than 600 umbrella covers from over 30 countries.
The mission of the Umbrella Cover Museums states that it is "dedicated to the appreciation of the mundane in everyday life. It is about finding wonder and beauty in the simplest of things, and about knowing that there is always a story behind the cover."
The idea for the museum came when Hoffman was cleaning out a closet and came across seven umbrella covers.

Alien space bats

"Alien space bats" ("ASBs") is a neologism for plot devices used in alternate history to create a point of divergence that would otherwise be implausible.
Definition.
"Alien space bats" originally was used as a sarcastic attack on poorly written alternate histories due to lack of plausibility. These attacks are usually phrased as the need for alien space bats or by saying the alternate history has gone into "ASB territory". This original definition was used by one critic to criticize Harry Harrison's "Stars and Stripes" trilogy. The term eventually evolved into a reference to deus ex machina to create an impossible point of divergences. Examples include changes to the physical laws of nature, introducing magic into the world, time travel, and advanced aliens interfering in human affairs. An example of the latter is Harry Turtledove's "Worldwar" series.
History.
The term "alien space bats" was first coined, then popularized in the usenet group soc.history.what-if. Alison Brooks (1959-2002) is credited as the creator of the term, using it to debunk the possibility of a successful Operation Sea Lion by saying the only way it could be successful was if alien space bats helped the Nazis. Brooks regretted the use of the ASBs as a supernatural agency, preferring to restrict them to rhetoric. 
S. M. Stirling credited Brooks with creating the term in the acknowledgments section of "Dies the Fire" and also used the plot device to send Nantucket back in time in "Island in the Sea of Time" and change the laws of nature in "Dies the Fire". One character throughout "Dies the Fire" and its sequels believes the change to the laws of nature was done by an advanced alien race because the changes were finely tailored and refers to this race as alien space bats. In a review of "Dies the Fire", Dale Cozort addressed the perceived implausibility of the novel by saying "Just say to yourself, 'The elder gods or alien space bats took our toys away and that’s all there is to it.'" Paul Di Filippo uses the term often when reviewing the series. The term also appeared in John Birmingham's 2008 novel "Without Warning".

Slovenian Museum of Natural History

The Slovenian Museum of Natural History (, ) is a Slovenian national museum with natural history, scientific, and educational contents. It is the oldest cultural and scientific Slovenian institution.
The museum features national, European, and world wide collections demonstrating the changes in biodiversity, the development of the natural history thought, as well as different techniques of collection and preparation of samples. Its research activities focus on natural heritage of Slovenia.
The Slovenian Museum of Natural History operates in the Center District in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, at Museum Street (), near Tivoli Park, the Parliament and the Opera House. Along with the National Museum of Slovenia, it is housed in a building from 1885, built upon the plans by the Viennese architect Wilhelm Rezori and the master builder Wilhelm Treo from Ljubljana.
The symbol of the museum is an almost complete woolly mammoth skeleton, found in Nevlje near Kamnik in 1938. Its official publication, published since autumn 1978, has been named "Scopolia" in honour of Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, a leading Carniolan naturalist of the 18th century.
History.
The museum was founded in 1821 as the "Carniolan Estates Museum" (). Five years later, the Austrian Emperor Francis II decided to personally sponsor the museum and ordered its renaming to "Carniolan Provincial Museum". In 1882, the museum was renamed to "Carniolan Provincial Museum - Rudolphinum" in honour of the Crown Prince Rudolph.
After the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the name was changed to "National Museum". In 1944, it was divided into the National Museum of Slovenia and the Slovenian Museum of Natural History (then known as "Museum of Natural Sciences").
in 2005, the museum acquired its largest object, a skeleton of a young female fin whale Leonora, which was found dead at the Slovenian coast in 2003. The corpse weighted and was long. After an elaborate procedure, the skeleton was put on display in autumn 2011.
Collections.
The museum's geological-palaeontological collections include fossils from various Slovenian sites. In addition to the mammoth from Nevlje, also of significance are a 210 million-year-old long fish skeleton found in the Triglav Mountains and a Miocene-era baleen whale skeleton found in Slovenske Gorice.
One of the museum's founding collections was Sigmund Zois's mineral collection. Although it is an outstanding historical collection, minerals are now exhibited as classified by modern methods according to their internal structure, and among them is the mineral zoisite, named after Zois. There are also two Biedermeier wooden tables that are covered by tiles from Palnstorf's collection of minerals and rocks.
Hohenwart's collection of mollusc shells comprises about 5,000 specimens, dating from 1831 and originating mainly from the Indo-Pacific. The insect collection of Ferdinand J. Schmidt includes several interesting specimens, notably the "narrow-necked" blind cave beetles ("Leptodirus hochenwartii") that were described in 1831 as the first cave insect. The plants and animals of the mountains, marshes, and woods are shown in specialised dioramas. Also on view are permanent bird, reptile, fish, mammal and skeleton collections.
The Slovenian Wildlife Sound Archive is a collection of animal sounds, mainly on Heteroptera and cicadas, stored on digital and analogue recording media.

Hardcore skinhead

Hardcore skinheads are skinheads who mainly associate with hardcore instead of Oi!, ska, soul or other music genres associated with the skinhead subculture.
Starting in the early 1980s, there were many skinheads in the New York hardcore scene, although Detroit, Chicago, Seattle and Boston also had strong scenes. Skinheads became prevalent towards the end of the first wave of hardcore, and this continued through the youth crew era of hardcore. Many of the key New York skinhead hardcore bands were influenced by the burgeoning crossover thrash scene. In the early 1990s, there was a steep decline in the involvement of skinheads in the hardcore scene as more of them moved on to the American Oi! scene. However, these American Oi! bands were distinct from their British forerunners because they were influenced by the American hardcore sound. The hardcore skinhead scene did not completely fade away in New York City, with several bands coming from the DMS crew (Doc Marten Skinheads), such as Madball, Agnostic Front, and Murphy's Law.
Style and clothing.
Although characterised by some of the same items as British skinhead fashion (flight jackets, Ben Sherman shirts, Fred Perry shirts, rolled up jeans, braces, and combat boots or Dr. Martens boots), hardcore skinhead dress is considerably less strict than traditional skinhead style. Items that have been popular in the hardcore skinhead subculture include: leather jackets, army jackets, windbreaker jackets, hooded sweatshirts, bandanas, white "wifebeater" shirts, looser jeans (perhaps torn at the knee), heavy chains worn as belts, and construction or rigger's gloves. Trainer sneakers, in particular Adidas Sambas, have been popular.

A referendum on extending the operation of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was held in Lithuania on 12 October 2008, despite the fact that Lithuania is obliged to close down Ignalina per its treaty of accession to the European Union. Parliamentary elections were held on the same day.
The electorate were asked to vote on the statement: "I approve of the extension of operation of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant for a technically safe period, but not longer than completion of the construction of a new nuclear power plant."
The referendum was invalid due to low turnout (a minimum of 50% was required).

Philippe Vannier

Philippe Vannier (Vietnamese name: Nguyễn Văn Chấn / 阮文震, 1762–1842) was a French Navy officer and an adventurer who went into the service of Nguyễn Ánh, the future emperor Gia Long of Vietnam.
Life.
Vannier was born in Brittany, in the town of Auray. He had served from 1778 in the Royal French Navy, and had reportedly fought in the American War of Independence.
Philippe Vannier entered the service of Nguyễn Ánh in 1789 following the encouragements of Mgr Pigneau de Béhaine. In 1790, Nguyễn Ánh gave him the command of one of his ships. In 1792 he was in command of a warship furnished by Jean-Marie Dayot, and fought at the battle of Qui Nhơn. In 1800, Philippe Vannier was commander of the "Phoenix" ("Phuong-Phi"), the largest ship of Nguyễn Ánh's navy, with 26 guns and 300 men. In April 1801, he again fought in front of the harbour of Qui Nhơn, and was nominated General ("Brigadier") of the Navy. The battle opened the way for Nguyễn Ánh's invasion of northern Vietnam.
His second in command was another Frenchman, Renon, from Saint Malo.
After the end of the war in 1802 and the victory of Nguyễn Ánh, Philippe Vannier remained in the service of the Vietnamese king, as a Mandarin. He married a Vietnamese Christian woman named Madeleine Sel-Dong, with whom he had several children. He served Nguyen under the name Nguyen Van Chan until 1826, but then left Vietnam at the same time as Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, soon after the accession of Minh Mạng to the throne.

Description.
"Platyceras" has distinctive shape that is easily recognized. The cap-like shell is high and broad anteriorly. The posterior portion of the shell, at the apex, is usually slightly coiled in an asymmetrical fashion. Frequently, the front portions of the shells are broken, though the posterior sections are relatively well preserved. "Platyceras" is particularly abundant in Devonian deposits (359 million to 416 million years old.) "Platyceras" and other platyceratid gastropods are known for the complex symbiotic relationships they had with crinoids.

<doc id="19695722" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19695722" title="Ninja Blade">
Ninja Blade

Gameplay.
The player plays as a modern-day ninja, using a katana, twin swords and broad sword as the main weapon to the hostile creatures. Combat system is similar to "Ninja Gaiden" or "Devil May Cry". A chi bar is used up when "ninja vision" or ninjutsu is used. The gameplay is highly cinematic, relying on quick time events to finish missions; after attacking a boss until the health bar is empty, the player must perform a finishing move, called the "todome".
Plot.
In 2015, a small village was attacked by unknown creatures and the survivors were moved to a research facility where they underwent examination. While at the research facility, the survivors began to show symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis, and it was found out they are infected by a strange type of hookworm parasite, which was classified as "Alpha-worm". Conventional medicine had no effects on the patients and the worms deformed the victims, but the infection increased the strength and resilience of the people infected. The infected eventually broke free and attacked the researchers and, due to a fear of an outbreak, the military assaulted the facility and destroyed all traces of the infected. To prevent panic, governments of the world kept the Alpha-worms secret. The G.U.I.D.E (Global United Infestation Detection and Elimination) force was formed by Agent Michael Wilson, recruiting elite operatives from around the world. Eventually, after a massive outbreak of Alpha-worm infestation takes over the city of Tokyo, an elite ninja team including the young Ken Ogawa, and led by his father Kanbe, is sent to deal with the situation.
Development.
The concept for "Ninja Blade" initially came when From Software thrived to create a game that conveyed to the gamer the same intense sequences from those of Hollywood action films. From Software worked with Microsoft in creating the game's protagonist, Ken Ogawa. "Ninja Blade" producer Masanori Takeuchi said: "We worked closely with Microsoft in creating Ken. They provided us with lots of useful feedback and insightful consumer research of worldwide gamers. By cooperating and working together, Ken has become more appealing to a wider audience." The character was designed by Capcom 2nd Character Development Studio designer Keiji Nakaoka. 
The game has been categorized as a "cinematic action game," combining a mixture of hack and slash elements with context-sensitive commands. "Ninja Blade" was commonly referred to as "Otogi 3" by various sources before its official announcement.

Fire Study

Fire Study is a 2008 fantasy novel written by Maria V. Snyder. Fire Study is the third and final book in a three book series.
Summary.
Yelena and friends set off to capture Cahil and Ferde, the soul stealer, only to find that they are not the biggest threat to Sitia anymore. A clan of magicians using Blood magic is trying to take over the Citadel and they will kill anybody that stands in their way. But with the possibility of someone close to her being a traitor and the added stress of finding out what it means to be a Soul finder, Yelena may not be able to stop the Fire Warper from taking control of Sitia. Especially when her loyalty is tested and she may have to pick a side with the possibility of a war between Sitia and Ixia on the horizon.

When she returned to Sitia to study her magic she discovered that she is what they call a Soulfinder. This is something that many people in Sitia are afraid of because their history says Soulfinders were power hungry murderers. She is agile and flexible and was an acrobat when she lived at Brazell's orphanage. She comes from the Zaltana in Sitia that lives in the tree tops so she learned to climb at a young age. She is caught between her family and friends in Sitia, and her friends and lover, Valek, in Ixia. Yelena is a person who comforts everybody who is in need of it, as she demonstrates many times, but she also has a will to live that overpowers her, and sometimes makes her a little reckless, and it seems that trouble always finds her.

Plot summary.
After the events of Magic Study, Yelena creates a partnership with Irys to help explore her abilities. However Cahil and Ferde are still a threat. Her learning is cut short after getting a mysterious message from Moon Man saying he has found what they are looking for. 
She takes Leif along with her and soon meets up with the Sandseed people including her story weaver, Moon Man. They have found the Diviian camp so all the Sandseed warriors have gathered to exterminate the vermin. However things are not as they seem and the Diviian vermin get away. She travels with Moon Man, Leif, Marrok, and Tauno all over Sitia to try to find Cahil and Ferde.
On her search Yelena encounters the Fire Warper, a soul from the underworld who wants to get to the sky so he can control Sitia and Ixia. After following the trail through the Avibian plains, the Diviian plateau, the Zultana jungle and Booruby they finally find Cahil and Ferde and have to fight them.
While in battle Yelena goes into Ferde’s mind to have him turn against his back up and shoot paralytic darts at the other bad guys. While in there she also searches for information causing his soul to shred. They send Leif and Marrok back to the Citadel with the prisoners while Yelena, moon man and Tauno return to the Sandseed camp to find that the Diviian’s have taken over and killed or enslaved the Sandseed people. So the group retreats back to the Citadel.
When they get back to the citadel, there are Daviian vermin walking freely in the streets and Yelena finds out that Cahil claims he has been working on a secret mission and the first magician, Roze, is backing up his story. She also finds that she is in trouble because everyone is afraid of her because she shred Ferde’s soul. She is then told she must stay out of Sitian affairs and learn about being a soul finder from Gede Sandseed. When she goes to Gede he makes moon man walk into a fire and forces Yelena to follow him into the fire because he says she is the only one who can stop the Fire Warper in the fire lands of hell. She is saved by Leif who says that Valek sent him and they must run from the Citadel and wait for Valek in the woods.
Confused she mentally contacts Irys who tells her that Marrok has confessed to the council that he was working with Leif and Yelena to help the Diviian clan get support from Ixia to start a war. There for the council has ordered the execution of both Yelena and Leif. Valek meets them and tells them to return to Ixia and tell the commander what is going on. Then he leaves to take care of some things in the Citadel. While Leif and Yelena are crossing the border into Ixia they are joined by Moon Man, Marrok and Tauno. Marrok has been mentally messed with and when Yelena tries to fix him she finds Roze in his mind who tells her that one of them is a spy and now she knows where Yelena is and she will not be safe in Ixia. When they get into Ixia they are taken to the barracks of the officers and Yelena meets Maren who is now an adviser. The General of the area doesn’t plan on letting them get to the commander so Maren helps them get to the next station and gives her some escorts.
When they arrive and Yelena is able to talk to commander Ambrose she tells him that the Sitians are thinking about attacking but that they are being controlled by either magic or physical means. The commander then shows her a scroll sent to him by the Sitians saying that Yelena and her friends are dangerous fugitives who should be killed on sight. It has been signed by all the council and the Magicians except Irys and Bain. The commander offers her the chance to become his adviser and refuge for the rest of their group but no decision is made before Valek returns. The commander sees the bat that Opal gave to Yelena and sees the light inside so Yelena thinks that the commander must have magic as well. The commander then asks if she sees Opal again then she get one for the commander.
After having dinner with the commander Leif asks Yelena what is wrong with her she has been acting different since coming to Ixia he doesn’t think she is being the neutral 3rd party adviser she should be but she asks him how she can advise when one land wants her killed. She then tries to contact Irys but Roze feels her and tells her that Iris and Bain have been imprisoned for treason and are in the Keep’s Cells.
When Valek returns with Ari and Janco they tell the commander and Yelena’s group that the Citadel is being overrun with Warpers who are using magic. Valek says that he has a plan and that they will have to help Yelena because to assassinate the council right now would just send the whole country of Sitia to war against Ixia. After the meeting Valek and Yelena talk about what could be happening to make so many Warpers because if the clans in Sitia were missing people then they would notice. They make plans to leave and return to Sitia. Shortly after Yelena runs into Porter, the commanders Kennel master. He tells her that she may be able to help him and so he asks her to meet him at his house. When she gets there she discovers that Porter has been running a secret underground railroad to smuggle magical children out of the country before Valek can find them and kill them for the commander. However, trouble has found him because the past several children he sent have gone missing. He wants to know if Valek has found him and if his operation has been compromised. Yelena agrees to help him after things settle down and she also agrees to teach the children he already has to better control their gifts so he doesn’t have to send them away before she can find out what is going on.
On her way back to the castle from Porters she is drugged by Star. When she regains consciousness she can tell she is being transported but they keep her drugged. Finally she is left to become conscious and she wakes to Cahil who says that he has kept his promise to find someone to defeat her and Valek. He is taking her to Jal and the Fire Warper. She asks what he gets out of the arrangement and he says when she is killed he will get to see Valek suffer before he is killed and Cahil reclaims the Ixian throne. She is able to push the drugs they give her out of her system with her magic, creating the ability to escape but she realizes that the two girls from Porters house have been kidnapped as well and without any weapons she has to leave without them. Valek and Kiki, her horse, come and help her escape. When they reach a safe house Valek tells her that he allowed her to be kidnapped in order to find out where star was taking the girls. This causes a fight between Yelena and Valek and when they go back to get the girls they have already died. However Yelena is able to catch their souls and release them before the Warpers can collect their power.
Valek and Yelena then continue on to the Citadel and when they get there Yelena goes to the market. She stays for two days while trying to get in contact with the Zaltana clan council member. She finds out that the council members all had their family members stolen from them. That is why they have done everything the Diviian clan has told them to do. Yelena and Bovol return to Valek’s safe house and she contacts his daughter through him when she finds out where the family members are being held she is pulled out of the girls mind and pushed outside where the barn holding Kiki is on fire. Yelena runs into the fire to save Kiki but she is pulled into the Fire world to talk to the Fire Warper. He makes a deal with Yelena that if she captures a soul and then goes to him so that the 3 of them can get into the sky then when the Fire Warper becomes human again she and all her family and friends will be favored by him and he will save their lives and stop all the other Warpers and Cahil and Jal. Yelena reluctantly agrees but wants to try to find another way. When she returns to the living world she and Valek share a tender moment where she apologizes and admits to being afraid of her powers and wants to protect her loved ones from her. She also has a new animal friend who clings to her, a bat that she saw in the fire world. Ari and Janco then show up with Moon Man, Leif, Marrok, and Tauno and they formulate a plan. Yelena, Valek, Marrok, and Tauno are going to track the kidnapped family members down and rescue them while Moon Man and Leif try to find a way into the Keep and Ari and Janco organize a rebellion in the Citadel.
While separated and trying to save the kidnapped victims Yelena, Valek, and Marrok are drugged by Tauno. Valek and Yelena are forced to fight Tauno and the other vermin but before the last Warper is killed he sets the Barn that the Kidnapped victims are in on fire. Valek goes inside and Yelena gets Kiki and Topaz to kick the Barn wall in and the children and one adult man are able to escape before the ceiling collapses. Valek is presumed dead. Yelena and Marrok take the kidnapped people to a safe house and then return to the rendezvous point. On the way she stops by Opal's and buys more of her glass animals so that she can talk to the magicians when she goes to the other worlds. They have to tell the rest of the people that Valek didn’t make it and then Leif tells everyone that Moon man got captured. So they formulate a plan to get into the Citadel and Storm the Keep so they can release everyone who has been captured. Yelena spends the night seeing ghosts and she collects their souls and sends them to the sky. This she can do without using her magical energy.
While getting ready to get through the Citadel by hiding in merchandise boxes. Valek shows up with Gale Weatherstorm and explains that when the roof collapsed it sent them into the basement and they were able to survive because Gale used her magic to create a bubble of air. So with everyone united again they set off to stop the Warpers and Vermin. When they get into the Citadel they are stopped by Cahil who tells them that he wants to help them stop Jal and the Warpers because he doesn’t like the way they are gaining power by killing and he was just a tool they planned on using until they didn’t need him anymore. Yelena doesn’t trust him but since Jal already knows they are in the Citadel and they want to get into the Keeps prison any ways she agrees. As a sign of good faith Cahil tells them that Jal is really Roze.
When Yelena gets to Roze the rebellion starts and all the magicians in the citadel and the people start to fight the Vermin and Warpers but they have too much power and they begin to lose the fight. Roze Kills Moon Man to show Yelena how much power she actually possesses. So Yelena jumps into the fire to talk to the Fire Warper. With the Help of Moon Man Yelena is able to collect all the souls and send them where they belong into the Sky which is actually the blanket of magical power. She is then able to pull the souls out of all the Warpers including Roze and they lose their power. Then the resistance is able to capture Roze and the other Diviian vermin and they are charged with treason and murder and they hang. Yelena then takes the souls of all the Warpers, including Roze and the Fire Warper, and breathes them into the glass animals that Opal makes. This way they are trapped and can never use the blood magic again or help anyone use the blood magic again. She then returns to the normal world and she reunites with all those she loves. She is told that technically she is now a master magician because she passed the test by going into the fire realm and coming out with a spirit animal (her bat). She says that she doesn’t want to be a Master Magician she just wants to be the Liaison to Ixia and Sitia so that she can travel around both areas and send souls where they are meant to go. After a homecoming with Valek she then asks him to hide the sculptures with the Warpers souls in them so that no one can find them.

British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics

The British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics is a United Kingdom association for people interested in research in mathematics education.
Purpose.
BSRLM organises the Special Interest Group (SIG) on mathematics education for the British Educational Research Association (BERA). It is a participating society of the Joint Mathematical Council (JMC), and has close connections with teacher associations through British Congress for Mathematics Education (BCME).
Events.
BSRLM organises a day conference each academic term (three times each year) where members present reports of recently completed studies, work in progress or more speculative thinking. There are also on-going workshops run on a collaborative basis to investigate issues in different areas of interest. The summer meeting is usually preceded by a new researchers’ day and the autumn meeting includes an AGM. Many members of BSRLM are also involved in the Congress of the European Society for Research in Mathematics Education (CERME), the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education (IGPME) and other international research organisations.
Structure.
The membership of BSRLM is made up mostly of researchers, students, teachers and education advisors. BSRLM is run by an elected executive committee of seven members. The current chair is Professor John Monaghan, University of Leeds.
Origins of BSRLM.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were a number of teacher trainers and university lecturers in the UK, principally teaching mathematics and psychology, who became involved in research in the learning and teaching of mathematics, and in the movement to establish mathematics education as an academic discipline. Two groups who were meeting during this period were the Psychology of Mathematics Education Workshop, principally in London, and the British Society for the Psychology of Learning Mathematics, in locations in the Midlands. Since many individuals attended both of these groups, they eventually came together as BSRLM in January 1985.

Hendon War Memorial

Hendon War Memorial in Hendon, North London is located on the central reservation at the junction between Watford Way and The Burroughs. It was unveiled on St George's Day, 23 April 1922, but was moved to its present location in 1962.
History of the area.
By 1906, Sir Audley Neeld was building on the land that had been Renters Farm, starting with a new road from Station Road to Queens Road, later called Vivian Avenue. The eventual estate used many names associated with the family: Dallas, Audley, Elliot, Graham, Rundell, Vivian, and Algernon and, of course, Neeld. Other names are associated with Neeld estates in Grittleton, including Alderton, Foscote, Sevington, and Allington.
Hendon Central tube station and the Watford Way were constructed in 1923. Originally, the road was planned to cut through the Neeld Estate, but in January 1924 a local ratepayers' group in Hendon Central, backed by Hendon Urban District Council, petitioned the County Council and central government, and the route was changed so that it would pass up Queen's Road (better known now as Hendon Way).

Menhet, Menwi and Merti

Menhet, Menwi and Merti were three minor foreign-born wives of pharaoh Thutmose III who were buried in a lavishly furnished rock-cut tomb in Wady Gabbanat el-Qurud. Two of their names are West-Semitic in origin though none are Hurrian. Each were given the title of King's Wife, and were likely only minor members of the royal harem. It is not known if the women were even related since the faces on the lids of their canopic jars are all different.
The tomb of Thutmose III's foreign wives.
Their tomb was originally discovered in August 1916 in the desert mountain cliffs in the southwest valley near Luxor and promptly looted by Qurnawi villagers. When the Egyptian antiquities authorities tracked down the burial in September of that year, all that was left at the original site were the objects discarded by the tomb robbers. It is thought that originally there were three intact burials at the site. Only the gold and stone objects had survived as the wood and the mummies and wooden materials had disintegrated due to moisture "from water seeping through the cliffs above." However, most of their surviving funerary remains were tracked down and purchased on the antiquities market at the time and many now reside at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. 
Some of the treasures found within their tomb include gold diadems, gilded gold, toe and feet sandals, gold, carnelian and glass bracelets together with other vessels. Each of their bracelets are inscribed with the cartouche of Thutmose III. Other objects found in the tomb include Hathor decorated gold, silver and glass mirrors. While the collection is impressive, none of their headdresses employed the vulture motif used by more senior queens.
Like the cliff tomb of Hatshepsut that Howard Carter found in Wady A, the tomb of Thutmose's foreign wives was also cut into a crevice. Its entrance, though, "was cut into a platform about 10 metres from the wady floor, quite like Thutmosis III's tomb in the Valley of the Kings." Menhet, Menwi and Merti's tomb consisted "of a single undecorated chamber--ca. 5 X 7.5 metres, by 1.5 to more than 2 metres high."

<doc id="19696006" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19696006" title="Copper cladding">
Copper cladding

There are four main techniques used today in the UK and mainland Europe for copper cladding a building:
When selecting size of a cladding element, take wind-loadings into account, and also consider the standard sizes available of the sheet (or coil) pre-material, to minimise material wastage through off-cuts. This helps to reduce costs.
The choice of which system to use depends on the aesthetic effect required, and building geometry can also have an influence on the choice.
Copper cladding is very durable, lightweight compared to other materials and techniques, and at the end of the building life is also 100% recyclable.
Given the recent publicity about high metal prices, it may be surprising for most people to learn that copper is a very cost-effective cladding and roofing material. With good building design, materials choice and craftsmanship, copper roofing / facade cladding can be cheaper than slates or concrete tiles, especially when one takes into account the lasting colour, durability, maintenance-free and lightweight nature of the cladding.
Because the UK code of practice for "hard metal" cladding (as opposed to lead cladding) is quite old - CP143: part 12 (1970) - the major manufacturers have to provide detailed technical advice and information for architects, designers and builders, and cultivate skilled installers with years of experience to draw on.
Typically, an installer of hard metal roofing and cladding must put in around 8–10 years on-the-job in order to achieve a respectable experience on a work site.

Dublin University A.F.C.

Dublin University Association Football Club (DUAFC) is the association football club of Trinity College, Dublin. Founded in 1883, DUAFC is the oldest soccer club in the Republic of Ireland still in existence.
The senior squad plays regular matches in Leinster Senior League and the Irish Universities League, and competes in the Collingwood Cup intervarsity competition and the annual Colours match against University College Dublin A.F.C.. Last year, four of the current squad were selected to represent the Irish Universities side. The Freshers squad, composed of first year students, competes in the annual Harding Cup intervarsity and contests the Freshers Colours trophy with UCD. The club also administers the Megaleague, an internal soccer league for Trinity College students.
The club plays its home matches at College Park, on Trinity's campus. They also play at their grounds in Santry.
History.
Dublin University A.F.C. competed in the Irish Cup first in 1884, reaching the semi-finals in 1886 before losing 4-0 to Belfast side Distillery.
Dublin University players William Eames and Frederick Moorhead became the first Dublin-based players to be selected for Ireland in 1885. Between 1884 and 1891 nine players from Dublin University were capped at international level by Ireland in the British Home Championship.

Thomas Gardner Horridge

Sir Thomas Gardner Horridge (12 October 1857 – 25 July 1938) was a British High Court judge and Liberal politician.
He was the only son of John Horridge, chemist, of Tonge with Haulgh, and Margaret Barlow of Bolton, Lancashire. He was educated in Barnes, Surrey before becoming a solicitor in Southport in 1879. In 1884 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, serving in the Northern Circuit. In January 1901 it was announced that he was to be appointed a queen's counsel. With Victoria's death, the warrant was issued by her successor, George V, and he became a king's counsel.
In 1906 he was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester East, spectacularly unseating the former Conservative prime minister, Arthur Balfour. He particularly campaigned on the "Chinese Slavery" issue: the Conservative government's policy of using indentured Chinese labourers, housed in primitive enclosures, to operate South African gold mines.
Horridge stood down at the next general election in January, 1910, and resumed his legal career. He was promptly appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division, a decision that was criticised as political at the time. He subsequently dealt with cases in the Divorce and Bankruptcy Courts, and also took part in the trial for treason of Roger Casement. He was elected treasurer of the Middle Temple in 1929.
In 1937 he announced his resignation from the bench, aged 79. He was appointed a member of the privy council upon his retirement. He died at his home in Hove, Sussex in 1938, aged 80.
Horridge was married twice. In 1901 he married Evelyne Sandys of Lanarth, Cornwall, who died in 1920. In 1921 he married May Ethel Markham, widow of Alfred Isenberg. There were no children from either marriage.

Sprouts Elder

Lloyd 'Sprouts' Elder (born 4 August 1904 in Fresno, California, USA - died 1957) was an international motorcycle speedway rider. Elder is considered the father of American broadsliding.
Career.
Elder initially wanted to become a jockey but by his late teens had grown to almost six feet tall, leading to his 'Sprouts' nickname. He got a job in a motorcycle shop and began racing, eventually taking up speedway. He initially learned to race racing on some of the last surviving board track racing circuits during the 1920s. In the late 1920s Elder really began to make a name for himself by racing overseas.
Elder was also a pioneer of speedway racing in the USA. He was a champion rider at home and abroad during the 1920s and early 1930s and helped organize speedway racing on the east and west coasts of America, later becoming an AMA referee and a member of the competition committee. In 1925 Sprouts Elder became the inaugural AMA American Speedway Champion.
Elder was also a visitor to Australia, winning the Maroubra Golden Helmet four times in 1927, and once in 1928 on the concrete 1 mile Maroubra Speedway. In Australia Elder raced against top Australian as well as several top British and American riders who also spent the winter months racing in the Australian summer, mostly on the larger showground tracks of the day such as the Sydney Showground Speedway, Brisbane Exhibition Ground (Ekka), the Wayville Showground in Adelaide, and Perth's Claremont Speedway (as of 2014 only the Ekka and Wayville stand as they did in the late 1920's and early 1930's when Elder rode there). Elder also won titles in South America, including the first unofficial Speedway World Championship event at Buenos Aires, Argentina, while under contract to A.J.Hunting. He also won numerous Argentine Gold, Silver and Bronze Helmets in 1929, 1930 and 1930.
1928 saw Elder turn his attention to racing in the United Kingdom, becoming one of the most popular riders in the country. He could command fees of £100 per meeting, plus prize money, and once earned £350 in a day by racing at three nearby tracks. He is estimated to have earned £50,000 in his first three years of riding in Britain. Crowds of 30,000 to 40,000 were not uncommon at larger meetings during the heyday of speedway racing in England. Elder's popularity was revealed when the British paper "Speedway News" honoured Elder by calling him the greatest showman of all time. In 1928 he won several titles in Britain, including the Golden Helmet at White City, Manchester, the Golden Gauntlet and West Ham Championship at West Ham, the Silver Wheel and Silver Sash at Wimbledon, the Silver Belt at Custom House, and the Golden Helmet at Leicester, while also winning the Scottish Gold and Silver Helmets in 1929. He also rode for the West Ham Hammers in 1929, and in 1930 he rode for the Southampton Saints.
Elder was one of speedway's pioneers and featured in the first Star Riders' Championship, the forerunner to the Speedway World Championship in 1929. He was beaten in the semi final of the 'overseas' section by Australian Vic Huxley.
During the mid-1930s, Elder returned to the United States to help organize American speedway. Speedway racing was among the popular forms of motorcycle racing in the country. Elder, along with Wilbur Lamoreaux, Jack and Cordy Milne, he helped found and promote speedway in America.
Retirement.
Elder retired from racing after joining the California Highway Patrol and was responsible for securing sponsorship from the Highway Patrol for a number of meetings. Elder retired from the patrol after suffering life-threatening injuries in a traffic accident. Even after retirement, Elder stayed involved with racing through his duties on the AMA Competition Committee.
He lost his fortune after investing in a failed mining venture.
Death.
Elder died in 1957 after committing suicide following the death of his wife. He was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998.

R. Preston Chew

Roger Preston Chew (April 9, 1843 – March 16, 1921) was a noted horse artillery commander in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War. After the war, he was a prominent West Virginia businessman and railroad executive.
Biography.
Chew was born into a prominent family in Charles Town, West Virginia (then Virginia). The Chew family owned the The Hermitage, one of the oldest houses in western Virginia.
With the outbreak of the Civil War, young Chew raised a battery of horse artillery, "Chew's Battery," which eventually became part of the famous Laurel Brigade under Stonewall Jackson's command. He participated in all Jackson's campaigns until Jackson's death in May 1863; and, despite his youth, was promoted to the chief of the cavalry's guns under J.E.B. Stuart. He served through the Gettysburg Campaign, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor, the Siege of Petersburg, and the Appomattox Campaign.
After the war, Chew married Louise Fontaine Washington, daughter of the last owner of Mount Vernon at Blakeley. He engaged in numerous business ventures and was the president of the Eagle Manufacturing Company. In 1883, the Shenandoah Valley Railroad constructed what became known as Chew's Siding, a private spur that led from the main line to Chew's business. In 1890, with several business partners, he formed the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing, and Improvement Company and became its first president. 
Chew's wife, purchased her financially struggling uncle's mansion, "Blakeley", in 1875, and maintained ownership until 1892 when she sold it.

<doc id="19696317" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19696317" title="Phenolic content in wine">
Phenolic content in wine

The phenolic content in wine refers to the phenolic compounds—natural phenol and polyphenols—in wine, which include a large group of several hundred chemical compounds that affect the taste, color and mouthfeel of wine. These compounds include phenolic acids, stilbenoids, flavonols, dihydroflavonols, anthocyanins, flavanol monomers (catechins) and flavanol polymers (proanthocyanidins). This large group of natural phenols can be broadly separated into two categories, flavonoids and non-flavonoids. Flavonoids include the anthocyanins and tannins which contribute to the color and mouthfeel of the wine. The non-flavonoids include the stilbenoids such as resveratrol and phenolic acids such as benzoic, caffeic and cinnamic acids.
Origin of the phenolic compounds.
The natural phenols are not evenly distributed within the fruit. Phenolic acids are largely present in the pulp, anthocyanins and stilbenoids in the skin, and other phenols (catechins, proanthocyanidins and flavonols) in the skin and the seeds. During the growth cycle of the grapevine, sunlight will increase the concentration of phenolics in the grape berries, their development being an important component of canopy management. The proportion of the different phenols in any one wine will therefore vary according to the type of vinification. Red wine will be richer in phenols abundant in the skin and seeds, such as anthocyanin, proanthocyanidins and flavonols, whereas the phenols in white wine will essentially originate from the pulp, and these will be the phenolic acids together with lower amounts of catechins and stilbenes. Red wines will also have the phenols found in white wines.
Wine simple phenols are further transformed during wine aging into complex molecules formed notably by the condensation of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins, which explains the modification in the color. Anthocyanins react with catechins, proanthocyanidins and other wine components during wine aging to form new polymeric pigments resulting in a modification of the wine color and a lower astringency. Average total polyphenol content measured by the Folin method is 216 mg/100 ml for red wine and 32 mg/100 ml for white wine. The content of phenols in rosé wine (82 mg/100 ml) is intermediate between that in red and white wines.
In winemaking, the process of maceration or "skin contact" is used to increase the concentration of phenols in wine. Phenolic acids are found in the pulp or juice of the wine and can be commonly found in white wines which usually do not go through a maceration period. The process of oak aging can also introduce phenolic compounds into wine, most notably vanillin which adds vanilla aroma to wines.
Most wine phenols are classified as secondary metabolites and were not thought to be active in the primary metabolism and function of the grapevine. However, there is evidence that in some plants flavonoids play a role as endogenous regulators of auxin transport. They are water soluble and are usually secreted into the vacuole of the grapevine as glycosides.
Grape polyphenols.
"Vitis vinefera" produces many phenolic compounds. There is a varietal effect on the relative composition.
Flavonoids.
In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's phenolic content falls under the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the astringency, color and mouthfeel of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins that they receive during winemaking. There is on-going study into the health benefits of wine derived from the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids.
Flavonols.
Within the flavonoid category is a subcategory known as flavonols, which includes the yellow pigment - quercetin. Like other flavonoids, the concentration of flavonols in the grape berries increases as they are exposed to sunlight. Some viticulturalists will use measurement of flavonols such as quercetin as an indication of a vineyard's sun exposure and the effectiveness of canopy management techniques.
Anthocyanins.
Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds found throughout the plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of "veraison" when the skin of red wine grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must needs to be in contact with the grape skins in order for the anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes in the same way that many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.
There are several types of anthocyanins (as the glycoside) found in wine grapes which are responsible for the vast range of coloring from ruby red through to dark black found in wine grapes. Ampelographers can use this observation to assist in the identification of different grape varieties. The European vine family "Vitis vinifera" is characterized by anthocyanins that are composed of only one molecule of glucose while non-"vinifera" vines such as hybrids and the American "Vitis labrusca" will have anthocyanins with two molecules. This phenomenon is due to a double mutation in the anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase gene of "V. vinifera". In the mid-20th century, French ampelographers used this knowledge to test the various vine varieties throughout France to identify which vineyards still contained non-"vinifera" plantings.
Red-berried Pinot grape varieties are also known to not synthesize para-coumaroylated or acetylated anthocyanins as other varieties do.
The color variation in the finished red wine is partly derived from the ionization of anthocyanin pigments caused by the acidity of the wine. In this case, the three types of anthocyanin pigments are red, blue and colorless with the concentration of those various pigments dictating the color of the wine. A wine with low pH (and such greater acidity) will have a higher occurrence of ionized anthocyanins which will increase the amount of bright red pigments. Wines with a higher pH will have a higher concentration of blue and colorless pigments. As the wine ages, anthocyanins will react with other acids and compounds in wines such as tannins, pyruvic acid and acetaldehyde which will change the color of the wine, causing it to develop more "brick red" hues. These molecules will link up to create polymers that eventually exceed their solubility and become sediment at the bottom of wine bottles. Pyranoanthocyanins are chemical compounds formed in red wines by yeast during fermentation processes or during controlled oxygenation processes during the aging of wine.
Tannins.
Tannins refer to the diverse group of chemical compounds in wine that can affect the color, aging ability and texture of the wine. While tannins cannot be smelled or tasted, they can be perceived during wine tasting by the tactile drying sensation and sense of bitterness that they can leave in the mouth. This is due to the tendency of tannins to react with proteins, such as the ones found in saliva. In food and wine pairing, foods that are high in proteins (such as red meat) are often paired with tannic wines to minimize the astringency of tannins. However, many wine drinkers find the perception of tannins to be a positive trait—especially as it relates to mouthfeel. The management of tannins in the winemaking process is a key component in the resulting quality.
Tannins are found in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be introduced to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as "enological tannins", made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as "hydrolysable tannins" being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.
In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between "ripe" and "unripe" tannins present in the grape. This "physiological ripeness", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that "riper" tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as "softer" and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins.
A study in wine production and consumption has shown that tannins, in the form of proanthocyanidins, have a beneficial effect on vascular health. The study showed that tannins suppressed production of the peptide responsible for hardening arteries. To support their findings, the study also points out that wines from the regions of southwest France and Sardinia are particularly rich in proanthocyanidins, and that these regions also produce populations with longer life spans.
Reactions of tannins with the phenolic compound anthocyanidins creates another class of tannins known as "pigmented tannins" which influences the color of red wine. 
Addition of enological tannins.
Commercial preparations of tannins, known as "enological tannins", made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability.
Effects of tannins on the drinkability and aging potential of wine.
Tannins are a natural preservative in wine. Un-aged wines with high tannin content can be less palatable than wines with a lower level of tannins. Tannins can be described as leaving a dry and puckered feeling with a "furriness" in the mouth that can be compared to a stewed tea, which is also very tannic. This effect is particularly profound when drinking tannic wines without the benefit of food.
Many wine lovers see natural tannins (found particularly in varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon and often accentuated by heavy oak barrel aging) as a sign of potential longevity and ageability. Tannins impart a mouth-puckering astringency when the wine is young but "resolve" (through a chemical process called polymerization) into delicious and complex elements of "bottle bouquet" when the wine is cellared under appropriate temperature conditions, preferably in the range of a constant . Such wines mellow and improve with age with the tannic "backbone" helping the wine survive for as long as 40 years or more. In many regions (such as in Bordeaux), tannic grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon are blended with lower-tannin grapes such as Merlot or Cabernet Franc, diluting the tannic characteristics. White wines and wines that are vinified to be drunk young (for examples, see nouveau wines) typically have lower tannin levels.
Other flavonoids.
Flavan-3-ols (catechins) are flavonoids that contribute to the construction of various tannins and contribute to the perception of bitterness in wine. They are found in highest concentrations in grape seeds but are also in the skin and stems. Catechins play a role in the microbial defense of the grape berry, being produced in higher concentrations by the grape vines when it is being attacked by grape diseases such as downy mildew. Because of that grape vines in cool, damp climates produce catechins at high levels than vines in dry, hot climates. Together with anthocyanins and tannins they increase the stability of a wines color-meaning that a wine will be able to maintain its coloring for a longer period of time. The amount of catechins present varies among grape varieties with varietals like Pinot noir having high concentrations while Merlot and especially Syrah have very low levels. 
As an antioxidant, there are some studies into the health benefits of moderate consumption of wines high in catechins.
In red grapes, the main flavonol is on average quercetin, followed by myricetin, kaempferol, laricitrin, isorhamnetin, and syringetin. In white grapes, the main flavonol is quercetin, followed by kaempferol and isorhamnetin. The delphinidin-like flavonols myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin are missing in all white varieties, indicating that the enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase is not expressed in white grape varieties.
<br>Myricetin, laricitrin and syringetin, flavonols which are present in red grape varieties only, can be found in red wine.
Non-flavonoids.
Hydroxycinnammic acids.
Hydroxycinnamic acids are the most important group of nonflavonoid phenols in wine. The four most
abundant ones are the tartaric acid esters "trans"-caftaric, "cis"- and "trans"-coutaric, and "trans"-fertaric acids. In wine they are present also in the free form ("trans"-caffeic, "trans"-p-coumaric, and "trans"-ferulic acids).
Stilbenoids.
"V. vinifera" also produces stilbenoids. 
Resveratrol is found in highest concentration in the skins of wine grapes. The accumulation in ripe berries of different concentrations of both bound and free resveratrols depends on the maturity level and is highly variable according to the genotype. Both red and white wine grape varieties contain resveratrol, but more frequent skin contact and maceration leads to red wines normally having ten times more resveratrol than white wines. Resveratrol produced by grape vines provides defense against microbes, and production can be further artificially stimulated by ultraviolet radiation. Grapevines in cool, damp regions with higher risk of grape diseases, such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, tend to produce grapes with higher levels of resveratrol than warmer, drier wine regions such as California and Australia. Different grape varieties tend to have differing levels, with Muscadines and the Pinot family having high levels while the Cabernet family has lower levels of resveratrol. In the late 20th century interest in the possible health benefits of resveratrol in wine was spurred by discussion of the French paradox involving the health of wine drinkers in France.
Piceatannol is also present in grape from where it can be extracted and found in red wine.
Phenolic acids.
Vanillin is a phenolic aldehyde most commonly associated with the vanilla notes in wines that have been aged in oak. Trace amounts of vanillin are found naturally in grapes, but they are most prominent in the lignin structure of oak barrels. Newer barrels will impart more vanillin, with the concentration present decreasing with each subsequent usage.
Phenols from oak ageing.
Oak barrel will add compounds such as vanillin and hydrolysable tannins (ellagitannins). The hydrolyzable tannins present in oak are derived from lignin structures in the wood. They help protect the wine from oxidation and reduction.
4-Ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol are produced during ageing of red wine in oak barrels that are infected by brettanomyces .
Natural phenols and polyphenols from cork stoppers.
Low molecular weight polyphenols, as well as elagitannins, are susceptible to be extracted from cork stoppers into the wine. The identified polyphenols are gallic, protocatechuic, vanillic, caffeic, ferulic, and ellagic acids; protocatechuic, vanillic, coniferyl, and sinapic aldehydes; the coumarins aesculetin and scopoletin; the ellagitannins are roburins A and E, grandinin, vescalagin and castalagin.
Guaiacol is one of the molecules responsible for the cork taint wine fault.
Phenolic content in relation with wine making techniques.
Extraction levels in relation with grape pressing techniques.
Flash release is a technique used in wine pressing. The technique allows for a better extraction of phenolic compounds.
Microoxygeneation.
The exposure of wine to oxygen in limited quantities has an impact on phenolic content.
Phenolic compounds found in wine.
Depending on the methods of production, wine type, grape varieties, ageing processes, the following phenolics can be found in wine. The list, sorted in alphabetical order of common names, is not exhaustive.
Effects of phenolics on wine.
Phenolic may interact with volatiles and contribute to the specific release of aromas in a wine.

Mirza Dilshad Beg

Mirza Dilshad Beg was a Nepali parliamentarian with the dubious record of links with Dawood Ibrahim's D-company and Pakistan's ISI. He was murdered in 1998 at around 9:30 Pm in Siphal, kathmandu Nepal, at the time of Football World Cup.
Background.
Hailing from Deoria near Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, Mirza began his forays into the underworld around late eighties. He grew in notoriety through car thefts, assault, kidnapping and of course murders, later thought of his antecedents as petty crimes.
Involvement with the Underworld.
Mirza's graduation to the big league began after a chance meeting with Dawood Ibrahim in Mumbai in the early eighties, when both were struggling to carve a niche for themselves in India. Besides, Dawood, Mirza also had links with Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel, the brothers Amar and Ashwin Naik and members of the Pathan syndicate. However, he shot to prominence only after his association with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence operatives in India and Nepal.
The porous Indo-Nepal border helped him sneak in and out of his home state and into Nepal. From then on, his notoriety grew so much that the UP police announced a reward for his arrest.
Political Career in Nepal.
Beg, the elusive crook found Kathmandu safer than UP. Dawood's reputation of transforming crooks into kings in India also helped him in Nepal. Playing the communal card in the election, Mirza represented the Muslim minority in Hindu Nepal and won with a thumping majority. Beg had been elected to the House of Representatives from the Terai district of Kapilvastu in 1994 and held ministerial portfolios in two governments.
He resigned from the Nepal Sadbhawana Party, and joined the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party winning two consecutive terms from the Kapilavastu constituency in south-west Nepal. Finally, his shady past became his nemesis and began to erode his popularity as a politician. Mumbai's Crime Branch officers believed that Mirza regularly used his Krishna Nagar mansion to shelter gangsters on the run from Indian enforcement agencies.
His residence was also used for other illegal activities including confinement of abductees, drug-trafficking, gun-running and forging of documents.
He was so effective that Dawood, whose reach had spread from Dubai to Karachi and Colombo to London, regarded Kathmandu as his strongest base. In fact the mafia don even considered shifting to Kathmandu for a while, following the Gulshan Kumar murder. The Indian government had tried to extradite his lieutenant Abu Salem for the murder and had turned the heat on the UAE government to secure Salem's custody.However, it was Mirza's declining clout which forced him to change his mind, making him opt for the ISI sanctuary in Karachi.
Mirza's greed turned him towards gun-running, smuggling arms procured from the Afghan Mujahedins and the ISI, into India.
Mirza's exploits allegedly include an aborted bid on the life of UP Chief Minister Kalyan Singh in Nainital. Mirza's murder had also stunned the Mumbai underworld as most fugitives had, at some point in time, used Mirza's good offices for passage out of the country.
Murder.
Mirza Dilshad Beg was shot dead on June 29,1998 around 9:30 pm as he was on his way to visit his second wife in Siphal, Chabahil area. As he climbed from his car and was walking towards the residence, killers gunned him down. His driver, who was parking the car, was also killed. In an interview published in the Indian newsmagazine India Today Rajendra Sadashiv Nikhalje alias Chhota Rajan took the responsibility of killing Beg and alleged that "through the ISI, he (beg) was spreading terror in India" 
Murder Theories.
The intelligence reports available with the Indian Authorities, list three reasons why Beg was being targeted. Firstly, while Beg had initially helped Babloo Srivastava obtain a Nepalese passport, he did not come to his rescue when he was eventually arrested in Singapore in 1995. Babloo Srivastava's Nepalese citizenship was cancelled and he was handed over to the Indian authorities. 
Secondly, following Gulshan Kumar's killing in Mumbai, the main hit-man Vikram Wahi -- a close associate of Babloo Srivastava -- had absconded to Kathmandu and his local hideout was raided by the Nepal police. Even as the modalities for Wahi's surrender were being worked out, his dead body -- hacked into pieces -- was recovered at the Indo-Nepal border near Krishnanagar. Besides Babloo Srivastava, Wahi's associates including Karan Singh Magga -- who was to eventually gun down Beg on 29 June 1998 along with underworld don Chhota Rajan's associate, Rohit Verma -- harbored a grudge against him.
The third angle to the Nepal MP's killing, the intelligence report states, related to Shafi Mohammad Khan of Krishnanagar who was arrested in a narcotics case by the Nepal Police in Mumbai. Like Babloo Srivastava, he too was of the view that Mirza had made no efforts to secure his release after arrest nor was he extended sufficient help during his trial.
This, along with the internecine gang wars between Chota Rajan and Dawood Ibrahim were the main reasons for Mirza's murder. Chhota Rajan is believed to have contacted Rohit Verma in Nepal to organise the killing and advised him not to strike in Kathmandu. Babloo Srivastava then contacted Shafi Mohammad and gave him some money to arrange for a safe house in Kathmandu. Despite taking the money, Shafi was not able to find the place. The gang made its first attempt on Beg on 27 June 1998 and finally succeeded two days later when the MP was shot six or seven times before he finally collapsed, ending a bloody chapter of the Mumbai mafia's free run in the Himalayan kingdom.
In an interview to MiD DAY, Farid Tanasha, a key lieutenant of -Chhota Rajan admitted to being one of the main architects of the murder of Nepal's member of Parliament, Mirza Dilshad Baig who was killed in Kathmandu in 1998.

Paroxysmen

Paroxysmen ("Paroxysms"), opus 189, is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II. It was dedicated to the Gentlemen Students of Medicine at Vienna University" on the occasion of a ball held in the Sofienbad-Saal in January 1857. A critic of the newspaper Fremden-Blatt commented on the waltz: "The day before yesterday the Medical Students' Ball opened the season in the Sofienbad-Saal, which made the ball especially interesting when one saw for the first time the new and sumptuously decorated locale. The dance hall is newly hung throughout with red and gold drapery, the ceiling very tastefully prepared. Little statues, surrounded by flowers and leaves, heighten the appeal of the decorations. The music was personally conducted by Strauss and his waltz 'Paroxysmen', written especially for this ball, belongs to his best compositions."

Polyhedral combinatorics

Polyhedral combinatorics is a branch of mathematics, within combinatorics and discrete geometry, that studies the problems of counting and describing the faces of convex polyhedra and higher dimensional convex polytopes.
Research in polyhedral combinatorics falls into two distinct areas. Mathematicians in this area study the combinatorics of polytopes; for instance, they seek inequalities that describe the relations between the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of higher dimensions in arbitrary polytopes or in certain important subclasses of polytopes, and study other combinatorial properties of polytopes such as their connectivity and diameter (number of steps needed to reach any vertex from any other vertex). Additionally, many computer scientists use the phrase “polyhedral combinatorics” to describe research into precise descriptions of the faces of certain specific polytopes (especially 0-1 polytopes, whose vertices are subsets of a hypercube) arising from integer programming problems.
Faces and face-counting vectors.
A "face" of a convex polytope "P" may be defined as the intersection of "P" and a closed halfspace "H" such that the boundary of "H" contains no interior point of "P". The dimension of a face is the dimension of this hull. The 0-dimensional faces are the vertices themselves, and the 1-dimensional faces (called "edges") are line segments connecting pairs of vertices. Note that this definition also includes as faces the empty set and the whole polytope "P". If "P" itself has dimension "d", the faces of "P" with dimension "d" − 1 are called "facets" of "P" and the faces with dimension "d" − 2 are called "ridges". The faces of "P" may be partially ordered by inclusion, forming a face lattice that has as its top element "P" itself and as its bottom element the empty set.
A key tool in polyhedral combinatorics is the "ƒ-vector" of a polytope, the vector ("f"0, "f"1, ..., "f""d" − 1) where "fi" is the number of "i"-dimensional features of the polytope. For instance, a cube has eight vertices, twelve edges, and six facets, so its ƒ-vector is (8,12,6). The dual polytope has a ƒ-vector with the same numbers in the reverse order; thus, for instance, the regular octahedron, the dual to a cube, has the ƒ-vector (6,12,8). The "extended ƒ-vector" is formed by concatenating the number one at each end of the ƒ-vector, counting the number of objects at all levels of the face lattice; on the left side of the vector, "f"-1 = 1 counts the empty set as a face, while on the right side, "fd" = 1 counts "P" itself.
For the cube the extended ƒ-vector is (1,8,12,6,1) and for the octahedron it is (1,6,12,8,1). Although the vectors for these example polyhedra are unimodal (the coefficients, taken in left to right order, increase to a maximum and then decrease), there are higher dimensional polytopes for which this is not true.
For simplicial polytopes (polytopes in which every facet is a simplex), it is often convenient to transform these vectors, producing a different vector called the "h"-vector. If we interpret the terms of the ƒ-vector (omitting the final 1) as coefficients of a polynomial ƒ("x") = Σ"fix""d" − "i" − 1 (for instance, for the octahedron this gives the polynomial ƒ("x") = "x"3 + 6"x"2 + 12"x" + 8), then the "h"-vector lists the coefficients of the polynomial "h"("x") = ƒ("x" − 1) (again, for the octahedron, "h"("x") = "x"3 + 3"x"2 + 3"x" + 1). As Ziegler writes, “for various problems about simplicial polytopes, "h"-vectors are a much more convenient and concise way to encode the information about the face numbers than ƒ-vectors.”
Equalities and inequalities.
The most important relation among the coefficients of the ƒ-vector of a polytope is Euler's formula Σ(−1)"i""fi" = 0, where the terms of the sum range over the coefficients of the extended ƒ-vector. In three dimensions, moving the two 1's at the left and right ends of the extended ƒ-vector (1, "v", "e", "f", 1) to the right hand side of the equation transforms this identity into the more familiar form "v" − "e" + "f" = 2. From the fact that each facet of a three-dimensional polyhedron has at least three edges, it follows by double counting that 2"e" ≥ 3"f", and using this inequality to eliminate "e" and "f" from Euler's formula leads to the further inequalities "e" ≤ 3"v" − 6 and "f" ≤ 2"v" − 4. By duality, "e" ≤ 3"f" − 6 and "v" ≤ 2"f" − 4. It follows from Steinitz's theorem that any 3-dimensional integer vector satisfying these equalities and inequalities is the ƒ-vector of a convex polyhedron.
In higher dimensions, other relations among the numbers of faces of a polytope become important as well, including the Dehn–Sommerville equations which, expressed in terms of "h"-vectors of simplicial polytopes, take the simple form "h""k" = "h""d" − "k" for all "k". The instance of these equations with "k" = 0 is equivalent to Euler's formula but for "d" > 3 the other instances of these equations are linearly independent of each other and constrain the "h"-vectors (and therefore also the ƒ-vectors) in additional ways.
Another important inequality on polytope face counts is given by the upper bound theorem, first proven by , which states that a "d"-dimensional polytope with "n" vertices can have at most as many faces of any other dimension as a neighborly polytope with the same number of vertices:
where the asterisk means that the final term of the sum should be halved when "d" is even. Asymptotically, this implies that there are at most formula_2 faces of all dimensions.
Even in four dimensions, the set of possible ƒ-vectors of convex polytopes does not form a convex subset of the four-dimensional integer lattice, and much remains unknown about the possible values of these vectors.
Graph-theoretic properties.
Along with investigating the numbers of faces of polytopes, researchers have studied other combinatorial properties of them, such as descriptions of the graphs obtained from the vertices and edges of polytopes (their 1-skeleta).
Balinski's theorem states that the graph obtained in this way from any "d"-dimensional convex polytope is "d"-vertex-connected. In the case of three-dimensional polyhedra, this property and planarity may be used to exactly characterize the graphs of polyhedra: Steinitz's theorem states that "G" is the skeleton of a three-dimensional polyhedron if and only if "G" is a 3-vertex-connected planar graph. 
A theorem of Blind and Mani states that one can reconstruct the face structure of a simple polytope from its graph. This is in sharp contrast with (non-simple) neighborly polytopes whose graph is a complete graph. An elegant proof is due to Kalai and a polynomial time algorithm to recognize a face was recently found by Friedman.
In the context of the simplex method for linear programming, it is important to understand the diameter of a polytope, the minimum number of edges needed to reach any vertex by a path from any other vertex. The system of linear inequalities of a linear program define facets of a polytope representing all feasible solutions to the program, and the simplex method finds the optimal solution by following a path in this polytope. Thus, the diameter provides a lower bound on the number of steps this method requires.
Facets of 0-1 polytopes.
It is important in the context of cutting-plane methods for integer programming to be able to describe accurately the facets of polytopes that have vertices corresponding to the solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Often, these problems have solutions that can be described by binary vectors, and the corresponding polytopes have vertex coordinates that are all zero or one.
As an example, consider the Birkhoff polytope, the set of "n" × "n" matrices that can be formed from convex combinations of permutation matrices. Equivalently, its vertices can be thought of as describing all perfect matchings in a complete bipartite graph, and a linear optimization problem on this polytope can be interpreted as a bipartite minimum weight perfect matching problem. The "Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem" states that this polytope can be described by two types of linear inequality or equality. First, for each matrix cell, there is a constraint that this cell has a non-negative value. And second, for each row or column of the matrix, there is a constraint that the sum of the cells in that row or column equal one. The row and column constraints define a linear subspace of dimension "n"2 − 2"n" + 1 in which the Birkhoff polytope lies, and the non-negativity constraints define facets of the Birkhoff polytope within that subspace.
However, the Birkhoff polytope is unusual in that a complete description of its facets is available. For many other 0-1 polytopes, there are exponentially many or superexponentially many facets, and only partial descriptions of their facets are available.

Heleneborg

Heleneborg is an estate on Södermalm, a part of the city of Stockholm, Sweden. It is opposite Långholmen island (home to Långholmen prison until 1975).
The property was bought in 1669 by Jonas Österling and was used by the Swedish tobacco manufacturing company ("Tobakskompaniet") for tobacco production. However, after a conflict with both the company and the royal court, Österling went bankrupt and died in poverty in 1691. His estate was burnt down in 1701.
From 1739 to 1759 the estate was owned by Olof Forsberg, who produced white clay pipes on the premises.
Adolph Christiernin bought the property in 1759 and continued clay pipe production until 1766. He was a very wealthy man who spent his entire fortune on a fixed idea that he could find gold in the Swedish silver mines. He named the property Heleneborg after his wife Helena Catharina Malmin. Miserably poor, he had to abandon Heleneborg in 1767.
In the 1860s Heleneborg was owned by W.N. Burmester, who housed the manufacturer and inventor Immanuel Nobel on the premises. There his son Alfred Nobel and Alfred's brothers experimented with the safe handling of the explosive nitroglycerin. After a big explosion in this plant on September 3, 1864, which killed the youngest brother Emil Oskar Nobel, Alfred Nobel created the Alfred Nobel & Company in Germany to continue his work in more isolated circumstances.
In 1874 captain Johan Adolf Berg bought the estate and renovated it to its present appearance. After his death, his widow sold Heleneborg in 1906 and the grounds were divided into lots for construction of apartment houses. Only the main building of Heleneborg was left, and today it can still be seen next to Söder Mälarstrand, close to Västerbron.
Heleneborg has given its name to the close-by street Heleneborgsgatan.

Northeast Iowa Council

The Northeast Iowa Council is a council of the Boy Scouts of America that serves all Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, adult volunteers and Venturers in Northeast Iowa.
Organization.
The council is broken up geographically into districts:
Theoretically there is also a third district for Exploring.
C.S. Klaus.
Camp Klaus is situated within a wooded valley approximately NW of Colesburg, Iowa. The camp is approximately .
Camp C.S. Klaus has a large grass parade grounds area where the Lyon's Camp Office is located. This area has proven itself as a great location for activities and games. The parade grounds also provides a place for scout troops to camp during the off-season.
Geography.
The waterfalls within the camp are the source of Brownfield Creek, a trout stream that flows into a man made lake known as Lake John Deere. Many of the aquatics programs (canoeing, sailing, swimming, snorkeling, kayaking) offered at summer camp take place here. The lake is also known to have fish. Fishing for bassets, greengill and sour krout is quite common.
C.S. Klaus has a rustic dining hall that can seat approximately 200 people. The kitchen is fairly modern (renovated in 1998). The dining hall area is also utilized for winter camping.
Scattered along the road as you continue up the hill are the seven main campsites. Each campsite has running water, plat-forms for tents, latrine facilities, fire rings and several picnic tables. At the top of the hill is also a modern shower building with 12 individual shower units.
To the north of Lake John Deere lies the shooting sports range. In the late 1990s, this area was completely rebuilt, thanks to a large donation from the Dubuque Optimists Club, with a new rifle shooting range, new archery range, and improved shotgun range.
On the western edge of the lake is the Climbing and Rappelling Tower. This 4-story structure sits prominently overlooking the lake. The rappelling tower offers rappels of , and 8 different climbing areas, including 2 inverted climbs and a chimney climb.
The newest addition to the camp is the backyard also known as the valley. Purchased with donations from over 120 individuals and local businesses, this land was dedicated in 2006. The Backyard abuts the NE corner of the main camp. This piece of land is home to many new programs. This area is also home to the ice cave that scouts have been visiting for decades. This area is often utilized for wilderness survival, leave-no-trace camping, hiking, nature study, star-gazing, viewing wildlife and a competition level Navigation Course for teaching orienteering with a map and compass and GPS navigation.
Improvements.
Over the last 15 years, Camp C.S. Klaus has seen a tremendous number of improvement projects and additional facilities including, new building construction, building renovation, program upgrades and camp infrastructure upgrades. These improvements have come from many extremely dedicated volunteers that have donated much of their time, resources and skills. Despite these renovations the camp is still quite rustic.
Timmeu Lodge.
The Order of the Arrow Scouting's national honor society is represented in the Northeast Iowa Council by the Timmeu Lodge. The Timmeu Lodge is part of Section C-3A, in the Central Region.

<doc id="19696772" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19696772" title="Balloon release">
Balloon release

A balloon release occurs when a number of hydrogen or helium-filled balloons are allowed to float into the sky together, or in rapid succession. This may be done for fun, to create a photo opportunity to raise awareness of a cause or campaign, or as a competitive race. There is opposition to balloon releases due to the harm they cause to wildlife and domestic animals.
Balloon races.
A balloon race or balloon flight contest is a competition wherein the competitors attempt to send balloons as far as possible. Postcards are attached to the balloons which are then released. The flight of the balloons cannot be influenced by the competitors. Instead, success in the contest is dependent on the wind conditions and on the location in which the balloon lands. The contest depends on the goodwill of passers-by to find the balloons and return the postcards. A prize may be awarded to the person whose balloon travels the furthest.
Opposition.
A number of organisations (for example, in the United Kingdom, these include the Marine Conservation Society, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Tidy Britain Group, the National Farmers Union, and the RSPB) oppose balloon releases, because of the visual impact of the fallen, deflated balloons, and the risk of harm to wildlife and domestic animals which they pose. For these reasons, balloon releases are prohibited in some jurisdictions.
Compensation case.
In 2011, an farmer from Stalisfield Green near Ashford in Kent, England, successfully claimed compensation, after one of his bullocks choked to death on the string of a balloon released by pupils at Lyndhurst Primary School in Camberwell, south-east London, over 50 miles away, as part of a Comic Relief event.
Permissions.
Within many countries written permission is often required from the relevant airspace regulatory authority. In the UK this would be the Civil Aviation Authority, for releases over a certain number of balloons.

New York v. Belton

New York v. Belton, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that when a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, the officer may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile. Therefore, "Belton" extended the so-called "Chimel rule" of searches incident to a lawful arrest, established in "Chimel v. California" (1969), to vehicles. The Supreme Court sought to establish "bright line" rules to govern vehicle search incident to eliminate some confusion in the cases.
Background.
A New York State Police trooper stopped a speeding car. No one in the car knew the owner. The officer could smell marijuana, and he saw an envelope on the floor marked "Supergold" which he could see probably contained marijuana. He ordered the occupants out of the car and arrested them. He patted them down and then directed them to stand apart. He searched the passenger compartment and found cocaine in a pocket of Belton's coat. The New York Court of Appeals suppressed the search because there no longer was any danger of destruction of evidence.
Opinion of the court.
The Supreme Court noted that "no straightforward rule has emerged from the litigated cases respecting the question ... of the proper scope of a search of the interior of an automobile incident to a custodial arrest of its occupants." The Court thus resolved to establish a definitive rule and held:
The Court distinguished the Chadwick and Sanders situations as not involving "an arguably valid search incident to a lawful custodial arrest."
Thus, under "Belton", the entire passenger compartment of an automobile is subject to search under the search incident doctrine even if the arrestee is out of the car.
A nexus is required between the vehicle and the person arrested with or in the vehicle prior to the arrest.
Response to "Belton".
"Belton" has been criticized by legal scholars for allegedly failing to meet the constitutional standard of probable cause.
"Belton" has been distinguished by "Arizona v. Gant", which restricted searches incident to arrest to circumstance where it is reasonable to believe that: 1) the arrested individual might access the vehicle at the time of the search; or 2) the arrested individual's vehicle contains evidence of the offense that led to the arrest.

Symphony in G minor (Lalo)

The Symphony in G minor was Édouard Lalo’s final original orchestral composition. It was composed in 1885-1886. (There were two earlier symphonies composed by Lalo, believed destroyed). It was premiered on 7 February 1887 in Paris at the Concerts Lamoureux under Charles Lamoureux. 
It is a classically constructed romantic symphony with the composer’s Latin roots present in the melodies and orchestration. There are four movements with 28 minutes duration:
Instrumentation is two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani and strings. The full score was published by G. Hartmann in 1888, and brought out as a Heugel et Cie imprint in 1900 as plate 1820 (Heugel having purchased Hartmann in 1891). Xavier Leroux also made a four hand piano version, published by Heugel as plate 1795.
In a 7 March 1887 letter responding for information on the symphony to author and Wagner enthusiast Adolphe Jullien, Lalo stated his belief in pure music over descriptive music:
"“It appears that you personally wish to have some information regarding the thought which predominates in my symphony. Alas, I am going to scandalize you! I had no literary thought in the sense that you mean. When I write a composition to words, I become a slave to what convention terms the verities of musical expression, according to a given text. But when I write music without a literary text, I have before and about me only the domain of sounds, melodic and harmonic. For a musician, this immense field possesses in itself, aside from all literature, its poems and its dramas. As to my Symphony, I have presented the master phrase in a brief introduction, as you have been kind enough to remark; it predominates in the first movement, and I recall it in the others whenever my poetic or dramatic musical intentions (do not laugh!) make its intervention seem necessary to me”." 
Lalo’s symphony was called one of the "happiest" of French symphonies in a 1925 article in "The Musical Quarterly". Lalo’s is from the same period that produced three other notable French symphonies: Saint-Saëns Symphony No. 3 "Organ Symphony", d'Indy’s "Symphony on a French Mountain Air", and Franck’s Symphony in D minor. Lalo's work was neglected until Thomas Beecham "discovered" it and conducted it regularly. In the United States, only the New York Philharmonic amongst major symphony orchestras performed the work up to 1970 (that sole performance being in 1931).
A 1961 review of the first major recording (Beecham’s made in 1959 at the Salle Wagram in Paris) disparaged the composition as "not very rewarding. Both matter and manner are dull and undistinguished, without the sparkle and melodic charm of the popular "Symphonie Espagnole"". A 1976 review of Antonio de Almeida’s recording suggests that "the cyclic theme does bear an unfortunately close resemblance to the opening of the Brahms B-flat Piano Concerto, in a way that Lalo surely did not intend". This review finds the second movement the most cohesive of the four and "wonderfully scored", suggesting Bizet's Symphony in C as the "closest equivalent".

Istrouma Area Council

Istrouma Area Council serves Scouts in both Louisiana and Mississippi, primarily in the Greater Baton Rouge Area and Florida Parishes. Specifically, the council includes scouts from the following parishes: Ascension, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, West Feliciana, Iberville, Pointe Coupee, St. Helena, St. James, St. Tammany, Washington, and Tangipahoa. Wilkinson County is the sole Mississippi county in the council.
Scouting came to Louisiana shortly after the establishment of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910. Rev. T. M. Hunter of the First Presbyterian Church of Baton Rouge established the first troop in that year, and two years later, affiliated the troop with BSA. The Istrouma Area Council was officially established in 1919. In 1923, the Rotary Club of Baton Rouge presented the council with a campsite in Greenwell Springs called Camp Istrouma. After the council outgrew the camp, they raised money to move to the Avondale Scout Reservation located in East Feliciana Parish, doing so by the late 1950s. Istrouma was later sold to the United Methodist Church and serves as a Christian camp to this day.
Organization.
The council is administratively divided into districts:
Programs and activities.
Istrouma Area Council participates in various activities, primarily in and around Baton Rouge. Since 1935, scouts from the council serve as ushers and stretcher bearers at LSU home football games at Tiger Stadium. Each district holds an annual Camporee at Camp Avondale in the spring, and most districts hold Cub Scout Day Camps for a week at various locales within their district. Each district also holds a district Pinewood Derby event for Cub Scouts
Avondale Scout Reservation.
Avondale Scout Reservation is a reservation for Scouting located in East Feliciana Parish, three miles (5 km) east of Clinton, on Louisiana Highway 10. It opened in 1959 and became the default campground for Istrouma after Camp Istrouma could no longer serve the needs of the council. There are five camping areas: Camp Avondale, Camp Hunter, McGee camping area, Tigator camping area, and Woodbadge Hill. The main camping area, Camp Avondale, is located at the north end of the reservation and is closest to the front entrance and ranger's houses on Highway 10. There are 17 campsites with a capacity for 360 campers. Most campsites are named after various birds, Indian tribes, and wildlife. The campsites are adjacent to Lake Istrouma with its swimming and canoeing facilities. A dining hall overlooks the lake. Camp Hunter is located 1/2 miles west of Lake Istrouma directly south of the front entrance of the reservation. It has nine campsites. The McGee camping area is at the south end of the reservation just inside of the back gate on Louisiana Highway 63. There are 26 campsites surrounding Lake McGee and south of Lake Tigator, all named after cities and towns represented by the council. The Tigator camping area has fourteen campsites north of Tigator Lake and has two buildings: Perkins Lodge and the Long House. The water tank near campsite 3 (Natchez) is the highest point on the reservation. Woodbadge Hill is located one-quarter mile southwest of Lake Istrouma and has ten campsites.
Camp Avondale hosts week-long summer camps for Boy Scouts in June in which scouts can earn merit badges, participate in COPE, First Year Scouting, Shooting Scope, Aquatic, and various other activities. In conjunction with Boy Scout Camps, there are Webelos Resident Camps held in June. Other annual events include, but are not limited to: Winter Camp (held during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, Brownsea Training for youth leaders, The camp sports a dining hall, which has been referred to as "Roadkill Cafe" since the early 2000s. In addition, there is, among other buildings, an outdoor chapel, rifle and shotgun shooting ranges, an archery range, boat dock, blacksmith's shop, and trading post.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, efforts have been made to improve this campground. In 2001, the Manship family of Baton Rouge built a campground to accommodate handicapped scouts. Since then, private restrooms and showers, running water, improved sewage and plumbing, better roads, and electricity have all been added to campsites for use by scouts and scouters. In addition, existing buildings have been renovated and expanded.
The southern part of the Avondale Scout Reservation, specifically, the area around Lakes Tigator and McGee, is used by Cub Scouts. In the early 2000s, Family Cub World was created in this area and includes numerous activity sites for Cub Scouts, as well as a dining hall, chapel, and cabines.
Camp Carruth.
Camp Carruth is located in West Baton Rouge Parish off Rosedale Road (). Istrouma Area Council purchased the land in the late 1990s, and this campsite is used by Cub Scout and Boy Scout Units for both day events and overnight tent camping.
Quinipissa Lodge.
Quinipissa Lodge #479 is used by the local Order of the Arrow units. It was established in 1952, and in 1969, the Caddo House at Camp Avondale was dedicated for its use.

Inescapable

"Inescapable" is a song by Australian recording artist Jessica Mauboy, written by Diane Warren and produced by Youngboyz. It was the first single released from the deluxe edition of Mauboy's second studio album "Get 'Em Girls" on 15 July 2011. The song's lyrics revolve around "a relationship all gone wrong but also a celebration." "Inescapable" peaked at number four on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), becoming her highest-charting single since 2008's "Burn". An accompanying music video was directed by Mark Alston and filmed in Sydney. It features various scenes of Mauboy on different coloured backdrops and ends with a dedication to Jay Dee Springbett.
Background.
"Inescapable" was written by Diane Warren and produced by Youngboyz. It was one of the songs Warren and Mauboy worked on in Los Angeles for her second studio album, "Get 'Em Girls" (2010). However, the song did not make the final track list on the standard edition of "Get 'em Girls", and was later included on the deluxe edition. Mauboy told "The Daily Telegraph" that the song "is just about a relationship all gone wrong but also a celebration." Her manager David Champion said "Inescapable" was a dedication to Sony Music record-label executive Jay Dee Springbett, who was found dead at his Sydney apartment on 30 June 2011. Champion said, "Jess and JD worked very closely together on making Inescapable and she is devastated by his passing... His spirit lives on in the recording." "Inescapable" was sent to Australian contemporary hit radio on 4 July 2011, and was released for digital download on 15 July.
Reception.
"Inescapable" received positive reviews from music critics. Jonathon Moran of "The Daily Telegraph" praised the song for being "catchy, sexy, radio-friendly", while a writer for 97.3 FM called it "an absolute smash." On 1 August 2011, "Inescapable" debuted at number 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and number eight on the ARIA Urban Singles Chart. The song peaked at numbers four and one, respectively. This gave Mauboy her fifth top-ten hit in Australia. "Inescapable" was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for selling 140,000 digital copies.
Music video.
The music video for the song was directed by Mark Alston and filmed in Sydney. A behind-the-scenes video clip from "The Daily Telegraph" showed Mauboy on the set of the music video wearing a range of different outfits, including a leopard-print dress, leggings and sky-high heels. One of the scenes also showed Mauboy standing beside a male model who is tied up as she sings to him with a megaphone. The completed video premiered on Vevo on 15 July 2011.
Many scenes throughout the video are intercut. It opens showing Mauboy singing with a gold microphone in a gold cube without walls on a blue backdrop. The next scene Mauboy appears wearing a leopard-print dress with black boots; she is seen standing beside a man who is tied up as she sings to him with a megaphone in front of a gold backdrop. Another scene shows Mauboy wearing a navy blue jumpsuit in a room full of mirrors. Throughout the video, Mauboy can be seen with two male dancers performing choreography on a dark grey backdrop. The video ends with a dedication to Jay Dee Springbett saying, "To Jay, We did it! This is our song. Your forever in my heart. Love Jess." A writer for 97.3 FM called the video "vibrant, fun, colourful fantastic", and wrote that it "showcases Jess at her best & is exactly what the Australian public love about our girl."
Live performances.
Mauboy performed the song live for the first time at the 2011 ASTRA Awards on 21 July 2011. On 2 August 2011, she appeared on the grand finale of "Australia's Got Talent" to perform "Inescapable". For the performance, Mauboy wore a leopard-print jacket, black dress and black heels. She also performed the song on "Sunrise" on 9 August 2011, wearing a black and white dress with black heels.

The Underworld is the second studio album by the American thrash metal band Evildead, released on March 4, 1991 on Steamhammer Records. While the album was a mild success, it did not maintain the same popularity as "Annihilation of Civilization", likely due to its release coinciding with the advent of the grunge era, which ultimately resulted in a dramatic decline in the popularity of heavy metal in general. This would be their final album with founding vocalist Phil Flores (who left in 1993) and their only featuring guitarist Dan Flores (though he would stay in Evildead until their breakup and played on their 1994 demo EP "Terror"), bassist Karlos Medina (who also left in 1993) and drummer Doug Clawson (who left not long after the album was released).

Axis-aligned object

In geometry, an axis-aligned object (axis-parallel, axis-oriented) is an object in "n"-dimensional space whose shape is aligned with the coordinate axes of the space. 
Examples are axis-aligned rectangles (or hyperrectangles), the ones with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. Minimum bounding boxes are often implicitly assumed to be axis-aligned. A more general case is rectilinear polygons, the ones with all sides parallel to coordinate axes or rectilinear polyhedra. 
Many problems in computational geometry allow for algorithms with better computational complexity when restricted to (collections of) axis-oriented objects, such as axis-aligned rectangles or axis-aligned line segments.
A different kind of example are axis-aligned ellipsoids, i.e., the ellipsoids with principal axes parallel to the coordinate axes.

Noxious stimulus

A noxious stimulus is "an actually or potentially tissue damaging event." It is a prerequisite for nociception, which itself is a prerequisite for nociceptive pain.
Noxious stimuli can either be mechanical (e.g. pinching or other tissue deformation), chemical (e.g. exposure to acid or irritant), or thermal (e.g. high or low temperatures).
There are some types of tissue damage that are not detected by any sensory receptors, and thus cannot cause pain. Therefore, not all noxious stimuli are adequate stimuli of nociceptors. The adequate stimuli of nociceptors are termed "nociceptive stimuli". A " nociceptive stimulus" is defined as "an actually or potentially tissue damaging event transduced and encoded by nociceptors."

Birthright Unplugged was designed as a response to the popular Birthright Israel trips.
The name "Birthright Unplugged" is a spin on the "Birthright Israel" program, whose name and organization are founded upon the idea that Jews have the right to visit the Holy Land. The organization runs a second program, Birthright Re-Plugged, which takes Palestinian children on field trips in Israel to see the villages left by their families in 1948.
The Unplugged trip seeks to expose mostly North American people to the Palestinian side of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through travel and conversations with a range of Palestinian activists. In six days, they visit Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps in the West Bank and spend time with Palestinian refugees living inside Israel.
The Re-Plugged trip is for Palestinian children living in Palestine refugee camps. In two days, they visit Jerusalem, the Mediterranean Sea and the children's ancestral villages.
Reactions.
According to NGO Monitor, "much of the substance of these tours and programs is provided by officials from radical anti-Israel NGOs."

Elcot Park Hotel

The Mercure Newbury Elcot Park Hotel is a four star country hotel belonging to Jupiter Hotels and franchised as part of the Mercure hotel chain, situated within of land in the locality of Elcot near Kintbury in the English county of Berkshire.
History.
The hotel was built in 1768, possibly for Charles Dundas, a prominent landowner from the neighbouring village of Kintbury. Amongst the earliest inhabitants was Anthony Bushby Bacon who was a considerable iron master and colliery owner in Wales and southern England. He owned Elcot Park and previously rented both the Donnington Grove and Benham Park estates. The success of his exports to Russia and Sweden made him the wealthiest man in Britain according to records held in Wales.
Sale documents are held for 1844, when Elcot Park was sold with 122 acres (in contrast with today's 16). Lady Shelly, mother of the great poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, moved here with her remaining daughter, having suffered the double tragedy of her husband’s death at Field Place, Sussex and the death by drowning of Percy. The estate was then let for a number of years to various military families until the Shelly family sold their interest in Elcot Park to Sir Richard Vincent Sutton, 6th Baronet in 1899. Sir Richard’s main seat was Benham Park, and the land attached to Elcot at that time adjoined Benham Valence. Elcot Park was again let for a further 25 years to a prominent JP by the name of Richard Plaskett Thomas. He held substantial tea plantations in India. The land belonging to Elcot Park then became part of the tenancy for Elcot Farmhouse. The main mansion, parkland and outbuildings forming a separate tenancy.
During the early years of the Second World War, a Hampshire family – the Bramley Firths from Silchester became tenants. Towards the end of the war, a Mrs Whitehead had taken the tenancy and it was she who first had the initiative to create a “letting residence”. After a long fight to establish a licensed hotel, she finally gave up the struggle whilst in her late fifties.In the late 1940s the property was trading as Elcot Park Hotel & Country Club. Mrs Edith Weston bought the tenancy from Lady Helen De Crespigny in 1949 and continued trading on this basis, linking Elcot with her other family business in London (The Surrey Restaurant in Surrey St, London WC2). Mrs Weston ran it as a successful business with a wide clientele in the neighbourhood, until 1952 when it went into liquidation. The property remained empty for some ten years, until in 1967 a Mr Harold Sterne and his wife June took the tenancy with a serious attempt to create a worthy hotel. There was a programme of development that lasted some 18 years. Mr & Mrs Sterne were given the opportunity to purchase the property outright in 1977 and they continued the business until deciding to retire in 1987.
The hotel was purchased by a Mr Katzler and between 1987 and the end of May 1989, the hotel was further extended by the addition of 7 more bedrooms in the Mews Cottages, formerly the private accommodation of Mr Stern. As interest rates rose Mr Katzler decided to sell the property rather than continue his expansion and redevelopment plans. From June 1989 the hotel has been in company ownership. Resort Hotels added a tasteful extension giving the property a further 42 en-suite bedrooms and a Health Club with an indoor swimming pool, spa pool, sauna and mini-gym (although the Health Club is no longer in use). The restaurant was redecorated and extended and a new conservatory was built to replace the original one, which had been destroyed in the gales of 1987.
Jarvis Hotels acquired the property in 1994, bedrooms and bathrooms have been refurbished and a full kitchen re-fit has given the hotel the facility to host large local events. In September 2001 Jarvis joined with Ramada Hotels to form Ramada Jarvis. Following the demise of Ramada Jarvis, the hotel was re-branded and now trades as the Mercure Newbury Elcot Park Hotel.
Location.
Prospective guests seeking the hotel should follow the A4 from Newbury in the direction of Hungerford for roughly four miles, looking out for the Halfway Inn. Three quarters of a mile thereafter one should see the signs for the hotel). Taking the narrow winding road up the hill towards the hotel, one should exact extreme caution at all times.
The hotel is located on a slight hill overlooking the Kennet Valley with views towards Walbury Hill. Around the grounds there are trees, bushes and grass.

Criticism of Human Rights Watch

The international non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has been criticized by national governments, other NGOs, its founder and former Chairman Robert L. Bernstein, and the media. Among other things, critics have accused the organization of being influenced by United States government policy, particularly in relation to reporting on Latin America; ignoring anti-Semitism in Europe or being itself an anti-Semitic organization; biases in relation to the Arab–Israeli conflict; and unfair and biased reporting of human rights issues in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Accusations in relation to the Arab–Israeli conflict include claims that HRW is biased against Israel and that this bias in influenced by requesting or accepting donations from Saudi Arabian citizens. HRW has publicly responded to criticisms relating to its reporting on Latin America as well as in regards to the Arab–Israeli conflict.
Criticism from founder and former chairman, Robert Bernstein.
Robert L. Bernstein, a founder and former chairman of HRW, argued in October 2009 that "Human Rights Watch has lost critical perspective" on events in the Middle East. Bernstein argued that "he region is populated by authoritarian regimes with appalling human rights records. Yet in recent years Human Rights Watch has written far more condemnations of Israel for violations of international law than of any other country in the region." Tom Porteus, director of the London branch of Human Rights Watch, replied that the organization rejected Bernstein's "obvious double standard. Any credible human rights organization must apply the same human rights standards to all countries."
Allegations of poor research and inaccuracy.
Rupert Murdoch, owner of "The Times", accuses HRW of a lack of sufficient expertise to report on warfare because the organization has never hired any former members of any military or any person with expertise in warfare with the sole exception of Marc Garlasco. "The Times" accuses HRW of overriding its own researcher who wished to rescind a factually inaccurate report accusing Israel of responsibility for the Gaza beach explosion (2006).
HRW has been accused of bias in gathering evidence because it is said to be "credulous of civilian witnesses in places like Gaza and Afghanistan" but "skeptical of anyone in a uniform." Robert Bernstein, founder of HRW, now accuses the organization of poor research methods, for relying on "witnesses whose stories cannot be verified and who may testify for political advantage or because they fear retaliation from their own rulers." According to "The Times", HRW "does not always practice the transparency, tolerance and accountability it urges on others."
In 2012, New Europe wrote that HRW "allegedly erased references in its reports to its previous cooperation with the Gaddafi regime, including organization's MENA Director Sarah Leah Whitson's role in marketing Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer."
Allegations of selection bias.
"The Times" accuses HRW of "imbalance" since it ignores many human rights abusing regimes while covering other zones of conflict "intensely", notably Israel. It issued 5 lengthy reports on Israel in one 14-month period, whereas in 20 years it has issued only 4 reports on the conflict in Kashmir, despite the fact that there have been 80,000 conflict-related deaths in Kashmir and the fact that "torture and extrajudicial murder have taken place on a vast scale." It issued no report on post-election violence and repression in Iran. One source told The Times, "Iran is just not a bad guy that they are interested in highlighting. Their hearts are not in it. Let’s face it, the thing that really excites them is Israel.” The Times also accuses HRW of failing to report on human rights abuses of Arabs when "perpetrators are fellow Arabs."
Nick Cohen, writing in "The Spectator" in February 2013, says that both "Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch look with horror on those who speak out about murder, mutilation and oppression if the murderers, mutilators and oppressors do not fit into their script."
Allegations of ideological bias.
HRW founder Robert L. Bernstein accused HRW of allowing repressive regimes to play a "moral equivalence game" by failing to distinguish the evidence available from open and closed societies, and of failing to recognize the "difference between wrongs committed in self-defense and those perpetrated intentionally."
"The Times" accused HRW of filling its staff with former radical political activists including Joe Stork and Sarah Leah Whitson, writing, "theoretically an organization like HRW would not select as its researchers people who are so evidently on one side."
HRW has been accused of being unwilling or unable to perceive threats posed by radical Islam because their leftist ideology leads them to see criticism of Hezbollah, Hamas, Al Qaeda and similar groups as "a dangerous distraction from the real struggle." An example was the 2006 verbal attack on Peter Tatchell, who was accused of racism, Islamophobia and colonialism by HRW staff for criticizing Iranian execution of homosexuals.
Criticism of fund-raising policies.
HRW has been criticized for cooperating with the Saudi government by holding fundraisers in that country, and for not releasing the names of its Saudi donors.
On September 7, 2010, it was announced that George Soros planned to donate 100 million US dollars to Human Rights Watch. Soros's donation was criticized by Gerald Steinberg, the founder of the pro-Israel research organization NGO Monitor.
Accusations of bias for or against particular nations.
Allegations of bias concerning Latin America.
Claims have been made regarding alleged HRW bias with regards to Haiti, Venezuela and Honduras. Robert Naiman, policy director of Just Foreign Policy, has claimed that HRW is "often heavily influenced" by United States foreign policy.
Haiti.
The 2004 Haiti rebellion was a coup d'etat that removed elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti either voluntarily (according to US authorities) or involuntarily (according to Aristide and supporters) from the Americas on a US plane accompanied by US security personnel on 29 February 2004. Z Communications author Joe Emersberger claimed that HRW had accurately reported on human rights violations in Haiti following an earlier coup against Aristide, in 1991, but that it was inaccurate in reporting the relative numbers of violent deaths before and after the 2004 coup. Emersberger estimated the relative numbers of deaths as about 20–30 per year before the 2004 coup versus 1000 in the first month following the coup. He stated, "HRW's reports were not only inexcusably sparse, but they legitimized the overthrow of Aristide" and that HRW "knew that criminals were being incorporated into the police; yet they were silent about this contributing factor to the abuses that occurred under Aristide."
Venezuela.
Human Rights Watch's work in Venezuela became the subject of controversy in late 2008. In September 2008, Venezuela expelled two HRW staff accused of "anti-state activities" Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said "These groups, dressed up as human rights defenders, are financed by the United States. They are aligned with a policy of attacking countries that are building new economic models." On December 17, 2008 an open letter was sent to the HRW Board of Directors in response to an HRW report, entitled, "A Decade Under Chávez: Political Intolerance and Lost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela". 118 scholars from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, México, the United States, the U.K., Venezuela, and other countries publicly criticized HRW for a perceived bias against the government of Venezuela. The open letter criticized the report by stating that it "does not meet even the most minimal standards of scholarship, impartiality, accuracy, or credibility." The letter also criticized the lead author of the report, Jose Miguel Vivanco, for his "political agenda", and called on Mr. Vivanco to discuss or debate his claims in "any public forum of his choosing". Hugh O'Shaughnessy accused HRW of using false and misleading information, and said the report was "put together with the sort of know-nothing Washington bias..." Kenneth Roth, director of Human Rights Watch responded, claiming the letter misrepresents "both the substance and the source material of the report.". Tom Porteous, Human Rights Watch's London director, replied saying that O'Shaughnessy "...not only fails to provide any evidence for these allegations" but that "...more seriously he misrepresents HRW's positions in his apparent determination to undermine our well earned international reputation for accuracy and impartiality."
Honduras.
On August 21, 2009, 93 academics and authors from the UK, US, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Colombia and other countries published an open letter in which they criticized HRW for HRW's "absence of statements and reports" on human rights violations in Honduras after July 8th, 2009, following the coup d'état of 28 June 2009. The authors of the statement said that after 8 July, HRW had not "raised the alarm over the extra-judicial killings, arbitrary detentions, physical assaults, and attacks on the press - many of which have been thoroughly documented - that have occurred in Honduras, in most cases by the coup regime against the supporters of the democratic and constitutional government of Manuel Zelaya." The authors requested HRW to make a strong statement against the human rights violations and to conduct its own investigation into them. The letter signers stated that the Obama administration was supporting the "de facto" Roberto Micheletti government, by providing "aid money through the Millennium Challenge Account and other sources" and by training Honduran military students at the School of the Americas, and that the Obama administration was ignoring Honduras' human rights situation. Four days later, HRW published a summary of a preliminary version of a major human rights report in Honduras by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) that had been released by IACHR on 21 August. HRW referred to its earlier reports published up to 8 July, stating "Given the scope of alleged abuses, and the region's history of bloody coups leading to massive violations, human rights advocates believed the situation warranted the direct intervention of the region's most authoritative human rights investigative body, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights." HRW did not state whether or not its summary of the IACHR preliminary report constituted a response to the 93 academics' and authors' appeal.
Allegations of bias concerning the Arab–Israeli conflict.
Some criticisms of HRW relate to the roughly one century of political tensions and open hostilities of the Arab–Israeli conflict.
Anti-Israel bias.
Aryeh Neier, a founder of Human Rights Watch, says that it "is wrong to suggest that open societies should be spared criticism for human rights abuses". Neier also states that Robert L. Bernstein's contention that the difference between "wrongs committed in self-defense and those committed intentionally" is not made by the laws of war. And that It is also a dangerous distinction. On such grounds, groups such as al-Qaeda in Iraq that murdered tens of thousands of civilians after the American invasion of 2003 could claim excuses for their crimes.
Anatoly (Natan) Sharansky argued, "here is an organization created by the goodwill of the free world to fight violations of human rights, which has become a tool in the hands of dictatorial regimes to fight against democracies ... It is time to call a spade a spade. The real activity of this organization today is a far cry from what it was set up 30 years ago to do: throw light in dark places where there is really no other way to find out what is happening regarding human rights." Kenneth Roth has responded that "Israel accounts for about 15 percent of our published output on the region" and that "our war coverage in the region has documented violations by all sides". Roth argued that "by failing to hold those responsible to account, Israel increases anger and resentment among the Palestinian population and in the wider Arab world, and undercuts moderates who wish to pursue peace." Scott MacLeod of "Time Magazine" commented that Israel's policies can't be shielded from a group like Human Rights Watch.
HRW has been accused of bias against the state of Israel of issuing one-sided and hostile reports attacking Israel and of having an anti-Israel agenda by general circulation newspapers, the Israeli government and supporters of Israel. Political Science Professor and former consultant to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gerald M. Steinberg of Bar Ilan University, head of NGO Monitor, a pro-Israel NGO accused HRW of having "a strong anti-Israel bias from the beginning". He claimed their reports were based primarily on "Palestinian eyewitness testimony" — testimony that is "not accurate, objective or credible but serves the political goal of indicting Israel". According to David Bernstein HRW is "maniacally anti-Israel". Mark Regev (spokesman for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu) has said that "We discovered during the Gaza operation and the Second Lebanon War that these organizations come in with a very strong agenda, and because they claim to have some kind of halo around them, they receive a status that they don't deserve," in reference to HRW's and Amnesty International’s allegations of human rights violations by Israeli forces during those conflicts.
There have been a number of accusations that HRW has either ignored anti-Semitism, or is, itself, anti-Semitic. Ana Palacio, former Foreign Minister of Spain, in a speech given to the Anti-Defamation League in 2005 said, “NGOs like Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International pay little attention to anti-Semitism.” It has also been suggested (by ADL) that criticism of Israel may be motivated by anti-semitism. Abraham Foxman writing in the New York Sun has said "not in an "eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth" fashion which Mr. Roth cited and is a classic anti-Semitic stereotype about Jews".
Sarah Leah Whitson, director of HRW's Middle East and North Africa division, responding to the criticism said "in the case of Israel, where our focus is primarily on the violations of international law and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territories, the fact that government is a democracy is completely irrelevant because the rule in place in the occupied territories is military rule, it is not a democracy". In July 2009, Larry Derfner writing in the Jerusalem Post in response to the criticism of HRW accused Israel's Prime Minister's Office and NGO Monitor of "smearing" human rights organizations. In August 2009, Iain Levine, Program Director for HRW stated "If the Israeli government wants to silence critics, it should fully investigate allegations of wrongdoing and take action to end the abuses."
Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote an editorial in "The Jerusalem Post" in August 2009 that the reports on recent Israeli human rights violations had "given rise to an intense campaign by the Israeli government and some of its uncritical supporters to smear the messengers and change the subject." He went on to write that the "problem is not the messenger carrying news of that misconduct, whether Judge Goldstone or the human rights groups that have been the target of a disinformation campaign launched by the Israeli government and some supporters. The problem is the conduct of the Israeli military."
According to "The Times", "most" of the Middle East department staff of Human Rights Watch "have activist backgrounds — it was typical that one newly hired researcher came to HRW from the extremist anti-Israel publication Electronic Intifada — unlikely to reassure anyone who thinks that human-rights organizations should be non-partisan."
In November 2012, David Feith, writing in "The Wall Street Journal", said that there has been some "bitter debate" within HRW as to whether Iran's call for annihilation of Israel is a violation of human rights. HRW Vice Chair Sid Sheinberg wrote that doing nothing while Ahmadinejad wants to "kill Jews and annihilate Israel...is a position unworthy of our great organization." But Executive Director Ken Roth says that "Tehran isn't inciting genocide and claims to the contrary are part of an effort to beat the war drums against Iran."
Garlasco incident.
Marc Garlasco, a senior investigator for HRW, has been criticized for being an avid collector of Nazi memorabilia. Emma Daly confirmed in March 2010 that Garlasco resigned from Human Rights Watch in February 2010, and offered no elaboration. “He has written a book, about Nazi-era medals. In one post he wrote: "That is so cool! The leather SS jacket makes my blood go cold it is so COOL!" Commenting on allegations concerning Garlasco in the media, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's policy director said on September 9, 2009 that Human Rights Watch's employment of "a man who trades and collects Nazi memorabilia" as its senior military expert is a "new low". HRW issued a rebuttal to the allegations which stated that the "accusation is demonstrably false and fits into a campaign to deflect attention from Human Rights Watch's rigorous and detailed reporting on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by the Israeli government." noting that Garlasco, "has never held or expressed Nazi or anti-Semitic views." 
Helena Cobban, a fellow Middle East analyst of the Human Rights Watch Middle East advisory board, noted that Garlasco engaged with "people who clearly do seem to be Nazi sympathizers," something she called "extremely disturbing," 
HRW replies that Garlasco "covered Iraq as a senior intelligence analyst at the Pentagon" The Guardian reports that he served in this role for 7 years. In addition they write that he was chief of high-value targeting during the Iraq war in 2003, was on the Operation Desert Fox (Iraq) Battle Damage Assessment team in 1998, and led a Pentagon Battle Damage Assessment team to Kosovo in 1999. He also participated in over 50 interrogations as a subject matter expert.
In a piece for "The National", Alan Philps writes that "the Netanyahu government and its supporters have set out to destroy the credibility of the UN Human Rights Council and all non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working in the human rights field." "The aim is clearly to de-legitimize the organization at a time when its rights-based analysis coincides with the some of the views of the US president Barack Obama," Philps continued.
In a piece for the "Christian Science Monitor", Robert Marquand noted that a U.N. report "Jurist Richard Goldstone, head of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chief prosecutor for the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal" showed illegal white phosphorus use consistent with Garlasco's first hand testimony which was provided to the Monitor. Marquand further wrote that it wasn't okay "to use Garlasco to distract from or obfuscate findings that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have taken place in Gaza".
Criticism of fund raising in Saudi Arabia.
Some columnists have criticized Human Right Watch for requesting, encouraging or accepting financial donations in Saudi Arabia, and have criticized HRW's methods in which it requests, encourages or accepts these funds. According to the critics, these methods include the descriptions of HRW's "battles" and arguments with Israel and its supporters. Herb Keinon, a columnist for the" Jerusalem Post", and Jeffrey Goldberg, a correspondent for the Atlantic (magazine) and former columnist for the Jerusalem Post, claim this compromises HRW's integrity. In an email exchange, Jeffrey Goldberg asked HRW director Kenneth Roth if funds were raised to fight back against pro-Israel lobbying groups. Roth responded, "The Saudis obviously are aware of the systematic attacks on us by various reflexive defenders of Israel. Everyone is." During fundraisers, he states that these complaints are common in "discussions" and is not just exclusive to Saudi Arabia. Mark Regev (spokesman for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu) has said that "A human rights organization raising money in Saudi Arabia is like a women's rights group asking the Taliban for a donation," in response to HRW's fund raising visit to Saudi Arabia.
David Bernstein of the George Mason University School of Law writes, something's "wrong when a human rights organization goes to one of the worst countries in the world for human rights to raise money to wage lawfare against Israel." although IPS latter claimed he apologized for suggesting that HRW didn't also discuss Saudi human rights abuses during the meetings.
Human Rights Watch says the allegations that HRW had "compromised its neutrality" by meeting with Saudi donors were based on "misleading assumptions and wrong facts". HRW notes that staffers made two presentations in Saudi Arabia in May 2009 in private homes to people who were interested in Human Rights Watch. Among an estimated 50 guests at a reception in Riyadh, there were three with governmental affiliations, "the spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior; the deputy head of the Human Rights Commission, a governmental organization; and a member of the Shura Council, a government-appointed consultative body." According to HRW, none of those individuals were solicited for funds and HRW never accepts funds from government officials in any country. HRW stated that there is no reason why Saudi citizens cannot legitimately want to support human rights.
Gerald Steinberg, the executive director of NGO Monitor, said that the HRW defense was an "absurd attempt to cast a distinction between soliciting Saudi officials and prominent members of society who owe their very position to the regime."
HRW told Inter Press Service that the notion "that any money from Saudi Arabia is tainted because it comes from a country with a totalitarian ruling regime is a gross generalization." adding "The ethnic background of our donors is irrelevant to the work we do...It's not relevant to our work in Israel that many, many of our donors are Jewish. And it's not relevant for the work that we do that we get money from Arab countries".
According to HRW, its work in Saudi Arabia was discussed at the receptions, including "coverage of women's rights, the juvenile death penalty, domestic workers, and discrimination against religious minorities". HRW also claimed, "No other human rights group has produced a more comprehensive, detailed, and thorough body of work on Saudi Arabian human rights issues in recent years than Human Rights Watch" (HRW Saudi Arabia). Although the Gaza situation was covered, HRW claimed that the coverage was justified as the Gaza war dominated worldwide headlines and is a regional issue in Saudi Arabia. Criticism of HRW as anti-Israel was juxtaposed against the accusations HRW faces in much of the Middle East that HRW is soft on Israeli human rights violations.
In 2008, HRW issued five single-country reports and one multi-country report criticizing the Saudi Arabian government and in August 2009, HRW issued a report "Human Rights and Saudi Arabia's Counterterrorism Response: Religious Counseling, Indefinite Detention, and Flawed Trials" criticizing the Saudi Arabian government's counterterrorism program.
Allegations of anti-Israel bias.
Ron Kampeas in an analysis published by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency criticizes HRW reports for "Reconstructions of the horrific death of civilians replete with painstakingly gathered evidence are coupled with bewildering omissions of context and blended into a package that assumes an inherent Israeli immorality," and "efforts to turn criticism of individual officers and soldiers into a wholesale indictment of Israel’s military establishment and the decision to resort to military force." According to Kampeas, the HRW reports on the 2009 fighting in Gaza "fail to assess evidence -- including videos of Israeli forces holding their fire because of the presence of civilians -- that Israel has provided to show that such incidents were the exception to the rule; they fail to examine what measures Israel has taken to prevent civilian deaths, which would be pertinent in examining any claim of war crimes."
In October 2009, Robert L. Bernstein, the founder of HRW, criticized the organization's policy in the Middle East in "The New York Times" op-ed. Bernstein questioned the fact that "with increasing frequency, casts aside its important distinction between open and closed societies... The region is populated by authoritarian regimes with appalling human rights records. Yet in recent years Human Rights Watch has written far more condemnations of Israel for violations of international law than of any other country in the region." Tom Porteus, director of the London branch of Human Rights Watch, replied that the organization rejected Bernstein's "obvious double standard. Any credible human rights organization must apply the same human rights standards to all countries." Jane Olson and Jonathan Fanton wrote "we were saddened to see Robert L. Bernstein argue that Israel should be judged by a different human rights standard than the rest of the world" and "as long as open societies commit human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch has a vital role to play in documenting those violations and advocating to bring them to an end." Human Rights Watch noted that Bernstein brought his concerns to the Human Rights Watch Board of Directors in April 2009 and also noted that the board unanimously rejected his view that Human Rights Watch should report only on closed societies, and expressed its full support for the organization's work.
In April 2010, The New Republic published a very lengthy and critical piece about HRW, discussing HRW's "giving disproportionate attention to Israeli misdeeds." The New Republic, referring to Bernstein's op-ed piece in "The New York Times", quotes Bernstein, saying, "Yet, as difficult as it was to go public, Bernstein does not believe that Human Rights Watch left him with much choice. 'They think they’ve heard me out,' he says. 'You see, they think they’ve listened to me until they can’t listen anymore. Actually, they haven’t listened at all.'"
In November 2010, Bernstein gave the Shirley and Leonard Goldstein Lecture on Human Rights at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. During this lecture, he accused HRW of "fault Israel as the principal offender" in theIsrael-Palestine conflict and suggested that groups like HRW were responsible for polarization on university campuses.
In December 2010, Jennifer Rubin, writing in her "Washington Post" blog, described HRW as "an anti-Israel group masquerading as one devoted to human rights".
In January 2012, New Europe quoted an NGO Monitor report which said that HRW gives "disproportionate attention" to 'Israel and the Occupied Territories' which received "more attention in 2011 than Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, or Iraq." The article also said that the HRW reports continued to show "bias on Israel," and that "all op-eds published on the Arab-Israeli conflict in major media focused on allegations against Israel."
Orlando Radice, writing in the Jewish British newspaper, The JC, said, regarding an interview with HRW director Ken Roth, that "this was less of an interview than an exercise in denial, obfuscation and plain old censorship."
Appointment of Shawan Jabrain.
In February 2011, HRW appointed Shawan Jabarin to their Mideast Advisory Board. Jabarin is a very controversial figure, labeled "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" by the Israeli Supreme Court, for his dual roles in both the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine militant group and the human rights organization Al Haq. HRW’s decision to include Jabarin on its Mideast Board sparked criticism from Robert L. Bernstein, a founder of HRW, Stuart Robinowitz, a prominent New York attorney who has undertaken human-rights missions for the American Bar Association and Helsinki Watch (the predecessor to HRW) in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and El Salvador, and Prof. Gerald Steinberg, the president of the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor.
Human Rights Watch responds to criticism.
In the wake of the Goldstone report, HRW accused in 2009 Israel and its supporters of an organized campaign of false allegations and misinformation aimed to discredit the group over its findings over the Gaza War. HRW ties the criticism to a statement by a senior official in the Israeli prime minister's office in June 2009, pledging to "dedicate time and manpower to combating" human rights organizations. HRW said it concluded the criticism amounted to an organized effort since attacks from different sources appeared to be co-ordinated. HRW said that similar language and arguments in criticism implied that there had been prior coordination. Iain Levine of HRW said "We are having to spend a lot of time repudiating the lies, the falsehoods, the misinformation".
A group of 10 Israeli rights groups has protested that the Israeli government has been attempting to "instill fear and silence or alarm vital organizations" that were engaging in free public discourse.
Pro-Israel bias.
In regards to reporting on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, Israel-based journalist Jonathan Cook claimed that by making statements regarding the intentions of Israel and Hezbollah to target or to avoid targeting civilians that were not justified by the available evidence, HRW "to distort its findings to placate the Israel lobby". Cook stated, 'HRW is accusing Hezbollah of committing graver war crimes than Israel, even though it killed far fewer civilians both numerically and proportionally, because its rockets are "less accurate"'. A representative of HRW responded, defending the organisation's objectivity. Cook countered that he did not criticise the empirical aspects of HRW's research, only its interpretation of that research.
HRW has also been criticised for taking Israel's side in its claim that the Palestinians had used human shields. Norman Finkelstein has criticised HRW for "seeking to appease pro-Israel critics after taking the heat for its report documenting Israeli war crimes in Lebanon?".
In late 2012 HRW was directly criticized by Hamas, the political organization that governs Gaza in the Palestinian territories, after HRW criticized Palestinian armed groups for launching hundreds of rockets toward populated areas in Israel in December 2012. A Hamas spokesperson responded that the Palestinians are fighting an occupying power and attempting to liberate their homeland, and that this is "not terrorism as HRW claims."
Ignoring Islamic laws.
A prominent Saudi human rights activist has described the Human Rights Watch report on the rights situation in Saudi Arabia as contradicting the truth in some of its items and does not take into account in many cases the religious background of the people of Saudi Arabia.
Allegations of bias concerning Africa.
HRW has also been accused of unfair and biased reporting of human rights issues in Eritrea and Ethiopia.
Eritrea.
In April 2009, HRW published a report that accused the Eritrean government of being responsible for serious human rights violations. Sophia Tesfamariam, Director of the US Foundation for the Horn of Africa refuted the allegations in the report which she described as an "anti-Eritrea report" and stated "HRW goes to great lengths to embellish the truth in its attempts to paint a bleak picture of Eritrea and its government". She described it as “not only short on facts and evidence, but also short on intellectual and professional integrity”.
Ethiopia.
The Ethiopian government has also raised questions about HRW's methods. It commissioned a report of its own that dismissed Human Rights Watch's allegations of human rights abuses in the Ogaden as hearsay and its methods as slapdash.
United States and the CIA.
Strong criticism against Human Rights Watch was caused by the Organization's declarations in favour of CIA illegal actions of Extraordinary rendition towards suspected terrorists. CIA Secret Rendition Policy Backed by Human Rights Groups? “Human Rights Watch and, apparently, other human rights groups signed off on renditions in talks with the Obama administration, saying publicly that there is "a legitimate place" for the practice...” 
Contempt of Court Charge in Bangladesh.
A special tribunal dealing with war crimes involving Bangladesh's 1971 independence war against Pakistan asked Human Rights Watch to explain why it shouldn't be charged with contempt of court for a statement from the organization saying the trial of former Islamic party leader Ghulam Azam was "deeply flawed" and did not meet international standards. Azam was sentenced to 90 years in jail for war crimes. The U.S. ambassador in Bangladesh expressed his concern over the prosecutors' move.

Najm Afandi

Najm Afandi (1893–1975) نجم آفندی was an important Urdu poet of his time who had numerous budding poets as his disciples. He was born in Agra in 1893. His father Bazm Afandi was himself a well-known poet of Bazm's time. The following verses are from Bazm's ghazal :
Najm Afandi moved to Hyderabad, Deccan at some point in his life. He started writing poetry early in his life and continued to do so for 65 years. His nazm durr-e-yateem was immensely popular, which he wrote while he was only 15 or 16 years of age. He experimented with various genres of Urdu poetry. Najm had in the later part of his life dedicated himself to writing marsiya, salaam, manqabat and qasida. Although he wrote numerous ghazals and nazms, because of the religious nature of his poetry and the issues he dealt, he was known as 'Shair-e-Ahle-bait.' An example of one of his religious verses is:
Long before Progressive Writers Movement came into existence his poetry dealt with the issues and themes which were the hallmark of the movement. 'Kisaan', 'Mazdoor ki Awaz', 'Hamari Id' are few poems of that era.
He died on a visit to Pakistan and is buried there. Josh Malihabadi who was his friend and associate from Hyderabad days wrote on his death "I held Najm's verses and poetry in great esteem which has no match, with his death Urdu is desolate."
He influenced greatly the new generation of poets who adopted marsia, salam, qasida and other similar genres of poetry in Urdu.

Infidel

Infidel (literally "one without faith") is a term used in certain religions, especially Christianity and Islam, for one who has no religious beliefs, or who doubts or rejects the central tenets of the particular religion.
"Infidel" is an ecclesiastical term in Christianity around which the Church developed a body of theology that deals with the concept of infidelity, which makes a clear differentiation between those who were baptized and followed the teachings of the Church versus those who are outside the faith. The term "infidel" was used by Christians to describe those perceived as the enemies of Christianity. When applied to non-monotheists, the usage of the word is similar to the appellations "heathen" or "pagan". As such, the term "infidel" has often been applied to atheists, whose disbelief is viewed negatively in both Christianity and Islam.
After the ancient world the concept of otherness, an exclusionary notion of the outside by societies with more or less coherent cultural boundaries, became associated with the development of the monotheistic and prophetic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The conception of infidelity as a theological condition is a result of their strict conformity to monotheism, as well as their rejection and condemnation of pagan rites.
Etymology.
The origins of the word Infidel date to the late 15th century, deriving from the French "infidèle" or Latin "īnfidēlis", from "in-" "not" + "fidēlis" "faithful" (from "fidēs" "faith", related to "fīdere" 'to trust'). The word originally denoted a person of a religion other than one's own, specifically a Christian to a Muslim, a Muslim to a Christian, or a Gentile to a Jew. Later meanings in the 15th century include "unbelieving", "a non-Christian" and "one who does not believe in religion" (1527).
Christian.
Christians have historically referred to people outside their religious group as infidels, somebody who has actively rejected the Christian religion. It only became a well established notion in English sometime in the early sixteenth century, when Jews or "Mohammedans", were described as active opponents to Christianity, and as such infidel was seen as term of contempt. In Catholic doctrine, an infidel is one who does not believe in the doctrine at all and is thus distinct from a heretic, who is one seen as having fallen astray from true doctrine, i.e. by denying the divinity of Jesus. Similarly, the ecclesiastical term was also used by the Methodist Church, in reference to those "without faith".
In later usage the term's definition was widened to include other forms of non-belief as well, such as:
Today, the usage of the term infidel has declined; the current preference is for the terms "non-Christians" and "non-believers" (persons without religious affiliations or beliefs), reflecting the commitment of mainstream Christian denominations to engage in dialog with persons of other faiths. Nevertheless, some apologists have argued for the usage of the term, stating that it does not come from a disrespectful perspective, but is similar to using the term "orthodox" for devout believers.
Moreover, some translations of the Bible, such as the Authorized Version, which is still in vogue today, employ the word infidel, while others supplant the term with nonbeliever; the term is found in two places:
Islamic.
Infidel is an English language word commonly used to translate the equivalent Arabic language word for non-Muslims; "kafir" (sometimes "kaafir", "kufr" or "kuffar"), and the equivalent Turkish loanword gâvur, literally the one who "covers" and "conceals", is usually translated as "disbeliever"; i.e. in English translations of the Quranic verse, 109:1, Other terms sometimes synonymously used in Islamic literature for infidel are shirk, mushirk, and mushrikun.
In earliest recited verses of Qur'an, such as Al-Kafirun, the term kafir simply divided Meccan community into believers and unbelievers. In later recited verses, particularly those recited after the Hijra in 622 AD, the concept of infidel - "kafir" - was expanded upon, with Jews and Christians included. The expanded term "kafir" refers to anyone who satisfies one or more of the following - practices idolatry of any form, does not accept absolute oneness of God, denies Muhammed as prophet, ignores God's ayah (evidence or signs), or rejects belief in resurrection and final judgment. Jews were condemned as infidels for their disbelief in God's "ayah", Christians were condemned as infidels for their belief in Trinity, which Qur'an declared as a form of idolatry. Certain sects of Islam, such as Wahhabism, include as kafir those Muslims who undertake Sufi shrine pilgrimage and follow Shia teachings about Imams.
The usage of "kafir", and related words with root k-f-r for infidel and unbelievers is very common in Qur'an and Hadith. Under Islam, an infidel (kafir) is considered unclean and ritually impure ("najasat"). Many scholars claim Islam's original sources (Qur'an and Hadith) and derived sources (Ijma, Qiyas and Qitabs) speak of violence against infidel unbelievers living in "Dar al-Harb" - countries where Islamic law is not in force, as a matter of religious duty of the Muslim community ("fard ala'l kifāya"). Other scholars disagree. Yet other scholars refer to the historical sequence of the verses, suggesting verses from early Meccan period recommend waiting and living apart from unbelievers. Later recited verses, such as Surah 2:191 recommend violence against unbelievers.
The sunnah in various hadiths, which record the teachings and actions of Muhammad, similarly recommend violence against kafir (disbelievers). For example, three different hadiths record the following action against infidels by the Prophet and his companions:
The term infidel, "kafir" in Islam, is broad. One group is the so-called "murtadd", who are variously translated as apostate or renegades. For renegades, Islamic law prescribes death, with the opportunity first of obeying the demand to return to Islam. The other group, the so-called "kafirun asliyun", or unbelievers proper, have only to expect death or slavery.
Some scholars claim Islam considers Jews and Christians as fellow believers. They are called "People of the Book ("Ahl al-kitab")". Other Islamic scholars, however, consider Jews and Christians as kafir. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, for example, claims, "it is well known among the Muslims, and they are unanimously agreed that the Christians are kaafirs, and even that those who do not regard them as kaafirs are also kaafirs." Similarly, Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz suggests, "The Jews and Christians are both kafirs and mushrikeen. They are kafirs because they deny the truth and reject it. And they are mushrikeen because they worship someone other than Allah." Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, and other scholars, consider annual worships by Christians such as Christmas as a celebration of the belief in the "Son of God" which in Islam is blasphemy and kafir.
Kafir, like infidel, has also come to be regarded as offensive.
Jewish.
Judaism has a notion of pagan gentiles who are called "acum" (an acronym of Ovdei Cohavim u-Mazzaloth or, literally, those who are "star-and-constellation worshippers") or idolaters. The Hebrew term, "kofer", cognate with the Arabic "kafir", is reserved for apostate Jews.
Infidels under Canon Law.
Right to rule.
In "Quid super his", Innocent IV, asked the question "s it licit to invade a land that infidels possess or which belongs to them?" and held that while Infidels had a right to "dominium" (right to rule themselves and choose their own governments), however the pope, as the Vicar of Christ, "de jure" possessed the care of their souls and had the right to politically intervene in their affairs if their ruler violated or allowed his subjects to violate a Christian and Euro-centric normative conception of Natural law, such as sexual perversion or idolatry. He also held that he had an obligation to send missionaries to infidel lands, and that if they were prevented from entering or preaching, then the pope was justified in dispatching Christian forces accompanied with missionaries to invade those lands, as Innocent stated simply "If the infidels do not obey, they ought to be compelled by the secular arm and war may be declared upon them by the pope, and nobody else." This was however not a reciprocal right and non-Christian missionaries such as those of Muslims could not be allowed to preach in Europe "because they are in error and we are on a righteous path."
A long line of Papal hierocratic canonists, most notably those who adhered to Alanus Anglicus's influential arguments of the Crusading-era, denied Infidel dominium, and asserted Rome's universal jurisdictional authority over the earth, and the right to authorize pagan conquests solely on the basis of non-belief because of their rejection of the Christian god. In the extreme hierocractic canonical discourse of the mid-twelfth century such as that espoused by Bernard of Clairvaux, the mystic leader of the Cisertcians, legitimized German colonial expansion and practice of forceful Christianisation in the Slavic territories as a holy war against the Wends, arguing that infidels should be killed wherever they posed a menace to Christians. When Frederick the II unilaterally arrogated papal authority, he took on the mantle to "destroy convert, and subjugate all barbarian nations." A power in papal doctrine reserved for the pope. Hostiensis, a student of Innocent, in accord with Alanus, also asserted "... by law infidels should be subject to the faithful." and the heretical quasi-Donatist John Wyclif, regarded as the forefather of English Reformation, also held that valid "dominium" rested on a state of grace.
The Teutonic Knights were one of the by-products of this papal hierocratic and German discourse. After the Crusades in the Levant, they moved to crusading activities in the infidel Baltics. Their crusades against the Lithuanians and Poles however precipitated the Lithuanian Controversy, and the Council of Constance, following the condemnation of Wyclif, found Hostiensis's views no longer acceptable and ruled against the knights. Future Church doctrine was then firmly aligned with Innocents IV's position.
The development of counter arguments later on the validity of Papal authority, the rights of infidels and the primacy of natural law, led to various treatises such as those by Hugo Grotius, John Locke, Immanuel Kant and Thomas Hobbes, which in turn led to the transformation of international law's treatment of the relationship between Christian and non-Christian societies and the development of human rights.
Colonization of the Americas.
During the Age of discovery, the Papal Bulls such as "Romanus Pontifex" and more importantly "inter caetera" (1493), implicitly removed "dominium" from infidels and granted them to the Spanish Empire and Portugal with the charter of guaranteeing the safety of missionaries. Subsequent English and French rejections of the bull refuted the Popes authority to exclude other Christian princes. As independent authorities such as the Head of the Church of England, they drew up charters for their own colonial missions based on the temporal right for care of infidel souls in language echoing the inter caetera. The charters and papal bulls would form the legal basis of future negotiations and consideration of claims as title deeds in the emerging Law of nations in the European colonization of the Americas.
The rights bestowed by "Romanus Pontifex" and "inter caetera" have never fallen from use, serving as the basis for legal arguments over the centuries. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1823 case "Johnson v. M'Intosh "that as a result of European discovery and assumption of ultimate dominion, Native Americans had only a right to occupancy of native lands, not the right of title. This decision was upheld in the 1831 case "Cherokee Nation v. Georgia", giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over Cherokees within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as "domestic dependent nations." This decision was modified in "Worcester v. Georgia", which stated that the U.S. federal government, and not individual states, had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans.
Native American groups including the Taíno and Onondaga have called on the Vatican to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1453, and 1493.
Marriage.
According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Church views Marriage as forbidden and null when conducted between the faithful (Christians) and infidels, unless a dispensation has been granted. This is because marriage is a sacrament of the Catholic Church, which infidels are deemed incapable of receiving.
As a philosophical tradition.
Some philosophers such as Thomas Paine, David Hume, George Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh, Voltaire and Rousseau earned the label of infidel or freethinkers, both personally and for their respective traditions of thought because of their attacks on religion and opposition to the Church. They established and participated in a distinctly labeled, infidel movement or tradition of thought, that sought to reform their societies which were steeped in Christian thought, practice, laws and culture. The Infidel tradition was distinct from parallel anti-Christian, sceptic or deist movements, in that it was anti-theistic and also synonymous with atheism. These traditions also sought to set up various independent model communities, as well as societies, whose traditions then gave rise to various other socio-political movements such as secularism in 1851, as well as developing close philosophical ties to some contemporary political movements such as socialism and the French Revolution.
Towards the early twentieth century, these movements sought to move away from the tag "infidel" because of its associate negative connotation in Christian thought, and is attributed to George Holyoake's coining the term 'secularism' in an attempt to bridge the gap with other theist and Christian liberal reform movements.
In 1793, Immanuel Kant's "Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason", reflected the Enlightenment periods' philosophical development, one which differentiated between the moral and rational and substituted rational/irrational for the original true believer/infidel distinction.
Implications upon medieval civil law.
Laws passed by the Catholic Church governed not just the laws between Christians and Infidels in matters of religious affairs, but also civil affairs. They were prohibited from participating or aiding in infidel religious rites, such as circumcisions or wearing images of non-Christian religious significance.
In the Early Middle Ages, based on the idea of the superiority of Christians to infidels, regulations came into place such as those forbidding Jews from possessing Christian slaves; the laws of the decretals further forbade Christians from entering the service of Jews, for Christian women to act as their nurses or midwives; forbidding Christians from employing Jewish physicians when ill; restricting Jews to definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted and to wear a dress by which they might be recognized.
Later during the Victorian era, testimony of either self declared, or those accused of being Infidels or Atheists, was not accepted in a court of law because it was felt that they had no moral imperative to not lie under oath because they did not believe in God, or Heaven and Hell.
These rules have now given way to modern legislation and Catholics, in civil life, are no longer governed by ecclesiastical law.

Tom Lewis (rugby player)

Tom Lewis (7 June 1904–31 May 1994) was a Welsh international number 8 who played club rugby for Cardiff and was capped three times for Wales. Lewis began his rugby career with his local team Taffs Well before being selected to play for first class team Cardiff. He played all his international games whilst with Cardiff and in the 1932/33 season he also captained his club team.
International rugby career.
Lewis was first selected to play for Wales in the 1926 Five Nations Championship when he faced England at the Cardiff Arms Park on the 16 January. Lewis was one of 8 new Welsh caps on the day, and the relative inexperienced team, under the captaincy of Rowe Harding, drew 3-3 with the England team. Lewis was dropped for the rest of the tournament, but was back in 1927, again against England, but this time at Twickenham. Wales lost the match 11-9, though the team played with only 14 men for most of the match, when Newports Dai Jones was injured in the first quarter of an hour. Lewis's last game was for Ossie Male's team against Scotland, again in the 1927 Five Nations Championship. Wales lost at home 5-0 and Lewis was never selected for any future games.

Sixth &amp; I Historic Synagogue

The Sixth & I Historic Synagogue is a non-denominational, non-membership, non-traditional Jewish synagogue located at the corner of Sixth Street and I Street, NW in the Chinatown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It is one of the oldest synagogues in the city. In addition to hosting religious services for different Jewish denominations, the synagogue hosts many lectures, concerts, and art exhibitions for the general public.
History.
The building was constructed by the Adas Israel congregation and dedicated on January 8, 1908, near what was then the main commercial district in town and the center of the Jewish community in Washington. In 1951 the congregation moved to a new building on Connecticut Avenue and sold its building on the corner of 6th and I Streets, NW to the Turner Memorial A.M.E. Church. The church in turn moved to Hyattsville, Maryland, fifty years later. 
Three local Jewish developers saved the historic building from being turned into a nightclub and preserved it to its original roots as a synagogue. The main impetus for the restoration came from real estate developer Shelton Zuckerman, who contacted Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin, who in turn contacted Douglas Jemal. Working from wedding photos from 1949, the building was returned to its original design and decor. It was rededicated and opened to the public on April 22, 2004. 
Sixth & I has been recognized by The Slingshot Fund in 2007-2008 as well as 2008-2009. Slingshot recognizes "the 50 most inspiring and innovative organizations, projects, and programs in the North American Jewish community today."
Cultural events.
Guest speakers have included Elie Wiesel, Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri, Nancy Pelosi, David Gregory, Chris and Kathleen Matthews, George W. Bush, Annie Leibovitz, Lewis Black, Toni Morrison, Tom Brokaw, A. B. Yehoshua, Rob Riggle, Amy Sedaris, and John Kerry.
Bands and singers have included Idina Menzel, Bryan Adams, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Chris Carrabba, Jack's Mannequin, Adele, Grizzly Bear, Idan Raichel Project, Yael Naim, Beirut, Joanna Newsom, Antony and the Johnsons, M. Ward, Devendra Banhart, Fiona Apple, Laura Marling, Marc Broussard and Matisyahu.
Worship.
Sixth & I Synagogue carries six sets of prayer books representing all Jewish denominations. The synagogue has five restored Torah scrolls that survived The Holocaust, including one of just thirteen to survive from Węgrów, Poland.
Partnerships.
Sixth & I partners with a wide variety of local and national organizations, including Politics & Prose Bookstore, IMP, National Geographic, B'nai B'rith, "Slate," "The New Republic" magazine, Taglit-Birthright Israel, The Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, JDub Records, and many others.

Criticism of Amnesty International

Criticism of Amnesty International (AI) includes claims of selection bias, ideological/foreign policy bias against either non-Western countries, or Western-supported countries and AI's policies relating to organisational continuity. Governments who have criticised AI include those of Israel, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China, Vietnam, Russia and the United States, who have attacked Amnesty International for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor. The actions of these governments — and of other governments critical of Amnesty International — have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty. The Catholic Church has also criticized Amnesty for its stance on abortion.
Excessive payouts to senior staff.
In February 2011, newspaper stories in the UK revealed that Irene Khan had received a payment of UK £533,103 from Amnesty International following her resignation from the organisation on 31 December 2009, a fact discovered in Amnesty's records for the 2009–2010 financial year. The sum paid to her was in excess of four times her annual salary of £132,490. The deputy secretary general, Kate Gilmore – who also resigned in December 2009 – received an ex-gratia payment of £320,000. Peter Pack, the chairman of Amnesty's international executive committee, said on 19 February 2011, "The payments to outgoing secretary general Irene Khan shown in the accounts of AI (Amnesty International) Ltd for the year ending 31 March 2010 include payments made as part of a confidential agreement between AI Ltd and Irene Khan." and that "It is a term of this agreement that no further comment on it will be made by either party." On 21 February Pack issued a further statement, in which he said that the payment was a "unique situation" that was "in the best interest of Amnesty’s work" and that there would be no repetition of it. He stated that "the new secretary general, with the full support of the IEC, has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again." Pack also stated that Amnesty was "fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights". 
In a letter to the "movement" dated 25 February, Pack offered additional details, which in turn had been made public by Amnesty International Netherlands. According to this statement Irene Khan, being reluctant to retire at the end of her second term, the International Executive Committee offered her additional termination benefits, payment of back salary, bonuses and other inducements to leave. UK employment law offering additional protections to fixed-term employees had given Khan leverage to ask for termination benefits. The alternatives, according to Pack, would have been her continuation in office, or an official dismissal which might have led to litigation.
Selection bias.
In 2007, AI stated that it reports disproportionately on relatively more democratic and open countries. AI's intention is not to produce a range of reports such that the number of reports on a country correlates precisely with the number and severity of its human rights abuses. Instead, its aim is: (a) to document what it can, to (b) produce pressure for improvement. These two factors skew the number of reports towards more open and democratic countries, because information is more easily obtainable, these countries have usually made strong claims and commitments to uphold human rights, and their governments are more susceptible to public pressure. AI also focuses more heavily on states than to other groups. This is due in part to the responsibility states have to the citizens they claim to represent.
Criticism related to Amnesty's criticism of non-Western countries.
Amnesty International has been accused of ideological bias by many governments of non-Western countries, including those of, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, and Russia who have attacked Amnesty International for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor. The actions of these governments — and of other governments critical of Amnesty International — have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty.
Claims of alignment with US/UK foreign policy interests and AI funding.
University of Illinois professor of international law Francis Boyle, who was a member of the board of Amnesty International USA at the end of the 1980s/early 1990s, claims that Amnesty International USA acted in ways closely related to United States and United Kingdom foreign policy interests. He stated that Amnesty, along with other human rights organisations in the US, failed to criticise sufficiently the Sabra and Shatila Massacre in Lebanon. Boyle stated his suspicion that the International Secretariat of Amnesty International, based geographically in London, UK, was also subject to this bias. He attributes the alleged links between Amnesty International and US and UK foreign policy interests to the relatively large financial contribution of Amnesty International USA to AI's international budget, which he estimated at 20%.
1991 Gulf War press release.
Critics have also pointed out that AI had a role propagating disinformation in a press release before the 1991 Gulf War, in which it claimed that Iraqi soldiers were responsible for the deaths of "scores of civilians, including newborn babies, who died as a direct result of their forced removal from life-support machines." It later transpired that this claim was a propaganda hoax, and AI's press release was used in the opening salvo of this propaganda campaign – U.S. President George H. W. Bush showed AI's press release on a prime time interview. Prof. Francis Boyle, an AI USA director at the time, gives a detailed insider account of the way the AI press release was handled. The normal process of double-checking and consultation was short-circuited in a rush to issue the press release. In an April 1991 statement, AI said that although its team was shown alleged mass graves of babies, it was not established how they had died and the team found no reliable evidence that Iraqi forces had caused the deaths of babies by removing them or ordering their removal from incubators.
Cricket ball campaign against Sri Lanka at the Cricket World Cup 2007.
AI launched its "Sri Lanka, Play by the Rules" campaign, timed to coincide with the Cricket World Cup 2007 held in the Caribbean islands, to focus on Sri Lanka's alleged human rights violations. The Sri Lankan government protested to the International Cricket Council (ICC) and AI, saying the timing might undermine the morale of the Sri Lanka cricket team, which was playing in round Super 8 of the tournament. The Sri Lankan government also accused AI of indirectly supporting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka said they got an assurance from the ICC that all steps would be taken to prevent AI from carrying out any campaign within the grounds targeting Sri Lanka or its players; however, the ICC later said it was determined to focus on the World Cup and nothing else.
AI stressed that the campaign was not aimed at the Sri Lanka cricket team. According to an AI spokesman, "The campaign called on both parties as well as other militant groups in Sri Lanka to take steps to prevent civilians caught between as violence intensifies." "The signed balls will be delivered to the government of Sri Lanka as well as the LTTE", AI said in a statement. The Sunday Island, a prominent national newspaper in Sri Lanka, criticised AI's response: "...when the campaign is directed at ‘Sri Lanka’, the focus is clearly on the country and its legitimate government rather than on the terrorists. When such a campaign is conducted during a sporting event in which the targeted country is also participating, it constitutes a form of punishment, whereby the spectators are told that the participant country is doing something bad. When that happens, they may adopt a wholly different attitude towards the Sri Lankan cricket team even though its not the cricket team that is of carrying out abductions and causing disappearances or waging war."
The Sri Lankan government criticized AI for selectively targeting Sri Lanka while not targeting other nations accused of human rights violations in the same sporting event, or in similar major sporting events. "One would like to ask Amnesty International whether it plans to take up the issue of human rights violations by the US government in Iraq or in Guantanamo Bay at the Super Bowl match or the National Basketball League championship," the director of the Sri Lankan president's Media Division said.
Syria.
In September 2011, Amnesty International reported that anti-Assad protestor Zainab al-Hosni's body, mutilated by pro-Assad forces, was "discovered by chance by her family in a morgue in Homs while there to identify her brother's corpse." In October 2011, Hosni allegedly appeared on Syrian TV stating that the accusations of her killing were false and fabricated by anti-Assad protestors to "serve foreign interests" and that she was "alive in contrast to what the lying satellite television stations had said." According to a report in Reuters, anti-Assad activists say she is a look-alike.
Criticism related to Amnesty's criticism of Western-backed countries.
Amnesty International has been accused of ideological bias by governments and citizens of Western or Western-supported countries, including Israel and the United States.
Israel.
Elliott Abrams, writing about the November 2012 Israeli military response in Gaza, says that AI treats "Hamas and other terrorist groups" "with an 'evenhandedness' that bespeaks deep biases," citing NGO Monitor's detailed research.
The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised the May 2012 report on administrative detention saying it was "one sided,” and “not particularly serious,” and "that it seemed little more than a public relations gimmick.” Gerald Steinberg, of NGO Monitor, said that the report was tied to the recent Palestinian hunger strikes and that AI “jumped on the bandwagon to help their Palestinian allies.” 
Steinberg also pointed out that one of the researchers, Deborah Hyams was not a neutral party, saying that “Hyams has volunteered as a ‘human shield’ in Beit Jala (near Bethlehem) to deter Israeli military responses to gunfire and mortars targeting Jewish civilians in Jerusalem,” and that “in 2008 she signed a letter claiming Israel is 'a state founded on terrorism, massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land.'
The Israeli embassy in London called AI “ridiculous”. AI admitted that this report “is not intended to address violations of detainees’ rights by the Palestinian Authority, or the Hamas de facto administration. These violations have been and will continue to be addressed separately by the organisation”.
In May 2012, NGO Monitor criticized AI's 2012 World Report in a few areas: 
AI allowed a speaking event to take place in London in May 2011, organized by the magazine Middle East Monitor Online (MEMO) and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Much controversy surrounded this event since one of the speakers included Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the London-based al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper. In the past, Atwan has said that "he would “dance with delight” in Trafalgar Square if Iran attacked Israel, "and that the terrorist attack on the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, in which eight students were killed, “was justified” as it was responsible for “hatching Israeli extremists and fundamentalists.” Amnesty responded by saying that "while we did have concerns about the way the event had originally been organized, these have been resolved."
AI also allowed a speaking event to take place in January 2012, which included a speaker who is viewed as anti-Israel. UK’s Zionist Federation said that the speaker "goes beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior" and asked that the event either not take place or that a pro-Israel speaker be allowed to attend as well. In addition, NGO Monitor's Gerald Steinberg said that the speaker's "intense hatred directed at Israel, which is the embodiment of Jewish sovereign equality in the world, is entirely inconsistent with the universal values that Amnesty claims to promote. If Amnesty seeks to restore its tarnished moral credentials, it must end this cooperation, and join in denouncing White’s anti-Israel campaigns."
Some people have criticized AI of promoting an unbalanced and excessive focus on Israel. The American Jewish Congress asserts that AI's criticism of Israel distorts the law of war by "readthe law of war as if it was a law banning war", and misinterprets the Geneva Conventions with regard to the issue of proportionality in war. Yael Beck and Merav Fima of NGO Monitor, a Pro-Israel NGO, claim the AI has an "obsession with Israel" and "persistently condemns Israel while ignoring suffering elsewhere".
Alan Dershowitz, professor of law at Harvard University, in his book "The Case for Israel", is very critical of AI and their comparison of Israel to nations such as Sudan and other offenders of human rights. Amnesty International has consistently called on Israel to bring any officer suspected of human rights violations to justice and to remove its settlements in the West Bank. It has also opposed "discrimination" against Arab citizens of Israel, and claims that the Law of Return and Entry into Israel Law are discriminatory, as they grant automatic citizenship to Jews worldwide, while denying Palestinian refugees the right of return. It has also opposed the blockade of the Gaza Strip, calling it "collective punishment".
In 2010 Frank Johansson, the chairman of Amnesty International-Finland called Israel a "nilkkimaa," a derogatory term variously translated as "scum state", "creep state" or "punk state." Johansson stood by his statement, saying that they were based on Israel's "repeated flouting of international law", and his own personal experiences with Israelis. When asked by a journalist if any other country on earth that could be described in these terms, he said that he could not think of any, although some individual “Russian officials” could be so described. According to Israeli professor Gerald M. Steinberg of NGO Monitor “Amnesty International has promoted an intense anti-Israel ideology, resulting in statements like these."
In November 2012, Amnesty UK began a disciplinary process against staffer Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty UK campaigns manager, because of a posting on his Twitter account, said to be anti-semitic, regarding three Jewish members of parliament and the Israeli military operation in Gaza where he wrote “Louise Ellman, Robert Halfon and Luciana Berger walk into a bar…each orders a round of B52s … #Gaza”. Amnesty International UK said “the matter has been referred to our internal and confidential processes.” Amnesty’s campaigns director Tim Hancock said, “We do not believe that humour is appropriate in the current circumstances, particularly from our own members of staff.” An Amnesty International UK spokesperson later said the charity had decided that “the tweet in question was ill-advised and had the potential to be offensive and inflammatory but was not racist or antisemitic".
Guantánamo Bay comments.
In the foreword to AI’s "Report 2005", the Secretary General, Irene Khan, referred to the Guantánamo Bay prison as "the gulag of our times, entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law. Trials by military commissions have made a mockery of justice and due process." In the subsequent press conference, she added, "If Guantanamo evokes images of Soviet repression, "ghost detainees" – or the incommunicado detention of unregistered detainees — bring back the practice of "disappearances" so popular with Latin American dictators in the past. According to US official sources there could be over 100 ghost detainees held by the US. In 2004, thousands of people were held by the US in Iraq, hundreds in Afghanistan and undisclosed numbers in undisclosed locations. AI is calling on the US Administration to "close Guantanamo and disclose the rest".
Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld believed the comments were "reprehensible", Vice President Dick Cheney said he was "offended", and President Bush said he believed the report was "absurd". The "Washington Post" editorialized that "lately the organization has tended to save its most vitriolic condemnations not for the world’s dictators but for the United States." The human rights organization Human Rights Watch also criticized the Bush administration over the camp in its 2003 world report, stating: "Washington has ignored human rights standards in its own treatment of terrorism suspects."
Edmund McWilliams, a retired senior US Foreign Service Officer who monitored Soviet and Vietnamese abuse of prisoners in their "gulags", defended Amnesty International’s comparison. "I note that abuses that I reported on in those inhumane systems parallel abuses reported in Guantanamo, at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan and at the Abu Ghraib prison: prisoners suspended from the ceiling and beaten to death; widespread "waterboarding"; prisoners "disappeared" to preclude monitoring by the International Committee of the Red Cross — and all with almost no senior-level accountability."
Pavel Litvinov, human rights activist and former Soviet-era "gulag" prisoner, criticized the analogy saying, "By any standard, Guantanamo and similar American-run prisons elsewhere do not resemble, in their conditions of detention or their scale, the concentration camp system that was at the core of a totalitarian communist system."
John Podhoretz writing in the New York Post on the difference between Guantanamo and a Soviet gulag said, "Maybe the people who work at Amnesty International really do think that the imprisonment of 600 certain or suspected terrorists is tantamount to the imprisonment of 25 million slaves. The case of Amnesty International proves that well-meaning people can make morality their life's work and still be little more than moral idiots."
William F. Schulz, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA, defended the statement, saying, "What is 'absurd' is President Bush's attempt to deny the deliberate policies of his administration." and "What is 'absurd' and indeed outrageous is the Bush administration's failure to undertake a full independent investigation". Secretary General Irene Khan also responded saying, "The administration's response has been that our report is absurd, that our allegations have no basis, and our answer is very simple: if that is so, open up these detention centres, allow us and others to visit them."
Since the U.S. administration originally claimed that these prisoners were not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against this interpretation (on 29 June 2006). Following this, on 7 July 2006, the Department of Defense issued an internal memo stating that prisoners will in the future be entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions.
In 2010, Gita Sahgal, an Amnesty senior official, publicly condemned the organization for its collaboration with former Guantanamo detainee Moazzam Begg of Cageprisoners. In a letter to Amnesty's leadership, she wrote: ""To be appearing on platforms with Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban, whom we treat as a human rights defender, is a gross error of judgment."" She warned that it ""constitutes a threat to human rights."" Begg has toured Europe with Amnesty officials. In 2010, Claudio Cordone asserted that Begg's views on holding talks with the Taliban or the role of jihad in self-defence were not antithetical to human rights, even though he may disagree with them. Cordone's assertion was criticized Amrita Chhachhi, Sara Hossain and Sunila Abeysekera who said that "defensive jihad" or "defence of religion" is often used as an excuse to violate human rights by Muslim, Christian and Hindu extremists.
AI's new abortion policies and the Roman Catholic Church.
In April 2007, Amnesty International changed its neutral stance on abortion to supporting access to abortion in cases of rape and incest, and when the life or the health of the mother might be threatened. Amnesty's official policy is that they "do not promote abortion as a universal right" but "support the decriminalisation of abortion". According to deputy secretary general Kate Gilmore, the debate over the change was difficult, but eventually the overwhelming majority of national Amnesty chapters supported the change.The change was opposed by several organizations, notably by senior figures in the Catholic Church, traditionally a strong supporter of Amnesty International, and a group of US legislators. She admitted a small number of members had quit over the issue.
The Roman Catholic Church's Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in June 2007 issued a statement urging Catholics not to donate to Amnesty because of their abortion stance. Cardinal Renato Martino said that abortion was murder and "to justify it selectively, in the event of rape, that is to define an innocent child in the belly of its mother as an enemy, as 'something one can destroy'". In an interview to the National Catholic Register, the Cardinal outlined that it was his belief that "if in fact Amnesty International persists in this course of action, individuals and Catholic organizations must withdraw their support, because, in deciding to promote abortion rights, AI has betrayed its mission". The church withdrew funding globally for Amnesty, and churches in various locations took other steps to sever their ties with the group.
Organisational continuity.
University of Illinois professor of international law Francis Boyle, who spent several years as an Amnesty International USA Board member, claimed that aspects of organisational continuity and survival came ahead of human rights aims. He stated "Amnesty International is primarily motivated not by human rights but by publicity. Second comes money. Third comes getting more members. Fourth, internal turf battles. And then finally, human rights, genuine human rights concerns."

Palestinian Youth Association for Leadership and Rights Activation

The Palestinian Youth Association for Leadership and Rights Activation (PYALARA) is a youth-oriented Palestinian communication and media non-governmental organization designed to provide a creative outlet for young Palestinians frustrated by the harsh conditions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians are taught to express themselves through written, oral, and media communications published in a monthly newspaper "The Youth Times" and a weekly television program, "Alli Sowtak" (Speak Up).
PYALARA uses an open, two-way communication system, rather than the one-way pedagogic method favored by most educational institutions, to impart knowledge. The focus is on empowerment through learning about the rights of children and youth, civil and legal rights during conflict, team-building, raising cultural awareness, protecting the environment and social activism. Students participate in journalism, counseling, and advocacy to overcome the marginalization and alienation of youth. 
PYALARA is as a major strategic partner for UNICEF and works closely with the Palestinian Ministry of Education, Ministry of Information, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Palestinian universities and colleges, many secondary schools, and several other NGOs. 
Criticism.
NGO Monitor criticized PYALARA's publishing of two articles for children which glorified Palestinian terrorism. One was about Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine leader Abu Ali Mustafa, calling him "a political leader ... whose history prides his nationalistic activism," without mentioning anything of his activities in planning and carrying out terrorist acts. The other article, referred to suicide bombers as "young Palestinians who have willingly sacrificed their lives in the name of their homeland." In addition, NGO Monitor criticized PYALARA for using funds “donated explicitly for non-political and non-violent projects in order to promote blatantly political objectives, including the indirect support for terror attacks on civilians."

<doc id="19697962" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19697962" title="Christian Peacemaker Teams">
Christian Peacemaker Teams

Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) is an international organization set up to support teams of peace workers in conflict areas around the world. These teams believe that they can lower the levels of violence through nonviolent direct action, human rights documentation, and nonviolence training. CPT sums their work up as "...committed to reducing violence by "getting in the way" ". CPT has a full-time corps of over 30 activists who currently work in Colombia, Iraq, the West Bank, the United States–Mexico border, and Kenora, Ontario, Canada. These teams are supported by over 150 reservists who spend two weeks to two months a year on location.
Christianity and CPT.
CPT has its roots in the historic peace churches of North America, and its four supporting denominations are the Mennonite Church USA, Mennonite Church Canada, Church of the Brethren, and the Religious Society of Friends. It is also sponsored by several Christian groups: "Every Church a Peace Church", "On Earth Peace", "Presbyterian Peace Fellowship", "Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America", and the "Congregation of St. Basil". In conflict areas it works in partnership with Jewish, Muslim and secular peace organizations, such as the International Solidarity Movement and Peace Brigades International. Another component of CPT's work is to engage "...congregations, meetings and support groups at home to play a key advocacy role with policy makers."
Although it is a Christian-based organization, CPT does not engage in any type of missionary activity. Their website states "While CPTers have chosen to follow Jesus Christ, they do not proselytize." This has raised the question of what distinguishes them from similar "secular", organizations;
"All the groups resemble one another other in that they all work to stop violence, but according to CPT's Web site, it has an advantage over secular groups: "In Muslim areas, the Christian nature of CPT helps to create confidence because of a shared sense of monotheism." The group does not believe that its Christianity might also put it at a dangerous disadvantage in areas of the world where religious tensions run high." 
Their website also states that Corp members are Christians, there is not faith requirement for members of CPT's short-term delegations. For example one of the CPT delegates who was held hostage in Iraq, Harmeet Singh Sooden, is a Sikh.
The Mennonite Church USA Archives is the repository of the official records of Christian Peacemaker Teams.
History.
The inspiration for the group came from Ron Sider at the Mennonite World Conference in 1984. At it, Sider criticized Mennonites and Brethren in Christ for reducing their peace witness to simple conscientious objection:
Unless we Mennonites and Brethren in Christ are ready to start to die by the thousands in dramatic vigorous new exploits for peace and justice, we should sadly confess that we really never meant what we said...
Unless comfortable North American and European Mennonites and Brethren in Christ are prepared to risk injury and death in nonviolent opposition to the injustice our societies foster and assist in Central America, the Philippines, and South Africa, we dare never whisper another word about pacifism to our sisters and brothers in those desperate lands...
Unless we are prepared to pay the cost of peacemaking, we have no right to claim the label or preach the message.
After a series of meetings, Gene Stoltzfus was hired as the first staff person for the new organization in 1988. Over the next few years CPT trainings and conferences explored various models for international peacemaking. In 1990, just before the Gulf War, CPT sent a team of 13 to Iraq for 10 days. This delegation proved to be the first of a number the group sent its first delegations to Haiti, Iraq, and the West Bank.
Iraq activities.
CPT has operated in Iraq since October 2002. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, they have worked with and advocated for families of people detained by the U.S. Military and collected stories of detainee abuse. In January 2004 they released a report documenting routine abuse of Iraqi prisoners held by Coalition Provisional Authority, well before the photographs of Abu Ghraib prisoners brought international attention to the issue.
Hostage crisis.
On 26 November 2005, four human rights workers associated with CPT were kidnapped in Baghdad:
The four had planned to visit the Muslim Clerics Association, an influential group of Sunni religious leaders formed in 2003 after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, and were about 100 metres from the entrance to a mosque where the meeting was to take place when they were abducted. Their captors are a previously unknown group, the Swords of Righteousness Brigade. The hostages were shown on a video broadcast released worldwide on 29 November by Arab satellite channel Al Jazeera. The captors branded their hostages as spies posing as Christian peace activists. The captors threatened to kill the hostages unless the US freed all Iraqi prisoners held in the US and Iraq.
A body found in Iraq on 10 March 2006 was identified later that day as being that of Tom Fox. During the crisis, the news had broken that he had performed for a long time with the United States Marine Band.
On March 23, 2006, the three remaining hostages were rescued from a house near the town of Mishahda by a multinational force. None of the kidnappers were found in the house at the time. The "Telegraph (UK)" reported that "A deal had been struck with a man detained the previous night who was one of the leaders of the kidnappers. He was allowed a telephone call to warn his henchmen to leave the kidnap house. When the troops moved in and found the prisoners alive, they also let him go as promised."
The rescue force was led by elements of 'Task Force Black' - a multinational counter-kidnap unit consisting of British, American and Canadian JTF2 special forces. They were supported by 'Task Force Maroon', a support unit made up of British Paras and marines. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Service were also involved.
The three surviving hostages were in good medical condition. While captive, they had been allowed to exercise and Kember had received medication he needs.
Although happy that the hostages were freed, CPT placed the responsibility for the kidnapping on the coalition itself: "We believe that the illegal occupation of Iraq by Multinational Forces is the root cause of the insecurity which led to this kidnapping and so much pain and suffering in Iraq." CPT initially made no mention of appreciation to coalition forces for the rescue in its statement, but did so in a later addenda after considerable media attention. It was reported that the CPT had not cooperated with the SAS officials who coordinated the rescue. CPT co-director Doug Pritchard stated that they did not want a "military raid" to occur and preferred to work with diplomats.
Work in Colombia.
CPT has had a team based in Barrancabermeja, Colombia since 2001. The focus of their work has been accompanying a number of communities along the Opon river, a tributary of the Magdalena River. The farmers and fishers from these communities displaced themselves in 2000 due to heavy fighting in 2000 between the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Since the community members returned to their homes in 2001, the team has had a nearly daily presence in the area to support the people, work to prevent intimidation by both AUC and FARC and document human rights abuses if they occur. The team also works with Colombian women's groups and human rights groups based in Barrancabermeja in an effort to reduce threats and violent acts carried out by the AUC in the city.
Work in Chiapas, Mexico.
CPT has, in the past, also been involved in Chiapas, Mexico, where violence had erupted between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government. CPT's long-term presence began in June 1998. In Chiapas, CPT partnered with a Christian civil society group called Las Abejas (the Bees) that shares a commitment to pacifism. Their joint activities included going to the bases of the Mexican military to pray.
Work in the Palestinian territories.
CPT has two teams in the Palestinian territories, one in Hebron and one in At-tuwani. Part of their daily routines includes school patrol, and monitoring settler violence and soldier home invasions. The teams also work against home demolitions. CPT believes the Israeli occupation is "violent", and that reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis can only flourish when the occupation ends.
In 2004, two CPT members, Kim Lamberty and Chris Brown in At-Tuwani were severely injured when Israeli settlers attacked them as they were walking children to school. A few days later, the team, along with Operation Dove and Amnesty International members were again attacked. In response to these attacks, the Israeli Knesset Committee for Children's Rights initiated an order to have soldiers escort the Palestinian children to school in At-Tuwani. However, CPT's report records that as of 10 November 2006, settlers had attacked or harassed the schoolchildren 40 times, in spite of the order by the Israeli Knesset Committee for Children's Rights to protect the children.
CPT has however condemned Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians. For example, when Egged bus #18 was bombed two Sundays in a row, CPTer Kathy Kern publicized the fact that she would ride the bus the following Sunday in protest.

Moll Flanders (1996 film)

Moll Flanders is a 1996 film starring Robin Wright and Morgan Freeman. The film was directed by Pen Densham. The original music score was composed by Mark Mancina. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Defoe.
Plot summary.
A young girl is picked up from a London orphanage and is told the story of her mother's (Moll Flanders) life on the way to the British West Indies.
Critical reaction.
Based on reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, "Moll Flanders" currently has a 47% approval rating from critics. A problem many critics had was with the movie largely throwing out the original Defoe story and structuring it like "Forrest Gump" (in which Wright was prominently featured). While the original book was about a woman's struggle to survive a male dominated era (the early 17th century) and her turning to illegal actions to make it through (stealing, prostitution among other means), the movie dealt with Moll's working on herself and improving her life.
Roger Ebert gave the movie three stars and said of the film "it's an original; Densham took only the name, the period, and a few notions from Defoe, and has made up the rest."
Awards.
The International Press Academy nominated "Moll Flanders" for four awards: Robin Wright for Best Actress in a Drama, John Lynch for Supporting Actor in a drama, Stockard Channing for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama, and a nomination for Costume Design.
Notes.
Released in 1996, but although still uses 1995 copyright on the film's closing credits

Red Wing Collectors Society

The Red Wing Collectors Society, Inc. has been dedicated to the preservation of Red Wing and other American pottery since 1977. The Red Wing Collectors Society is a special interest collecting organization in the United States with a membership of about 5000.
Organization history.
The Red Wing Collectors Society (RWCS) was founded in 1977 in conjunction with the Red Wing Collectors Society Newsletter, published by Dave Newkirk. The popularity of the RWCS Newsletter subscription and the publication of the "The Clay Giants" by Rev. Lyndon Veil laid the cornerstone for a meeting of like-minded collectors to gather in Red Wing, MN in July 1977. It was at that one-day event held at the Goodhue County Historical Society in July 1977 that the RWCS officially became an organization. Those who attended the event and joined the RWCS that day are considered charter members of the organization. Of the 300-500 people that attended the event, just over 200 people became members and over 75 of those members are still active as of October 2008.
From its start the RWCS has been dedicated to keeping what its members refer to as the "Red Wing legacy" alive. Its members focus on continually learning about the pottery products made in Red Wing, Minnesota and on making that information available to others.
Organization structure.
The RWCS maintains a board of directors that is responsible for many of the decisions of the Society. Positions on the board include President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Historian, Auction Manager, Education Manager, Commemorative Manager, and two Representatives-at-large. The Society's Executive Director is a non-voting member of the board. Board meeting times and locations are published in the bimonthly newsletter and are open for any member to attend.
During the annual Convention, held the second weekend in July, there is a general business meeting in which all members of the Society present may vote on issues, bylaw changes, and elect new officers to the board during election years.
Membership.
Membership is available to any individual who pays the annual membership dues. There are two levels of membership, Primary and Associate. A Primary member receives all benefits of membership, which include a bimonthly newsletter, the right to vote at the annual meeting, the ability to attend all portions of Society functions, the right to purchase a commemorative, and access to the Society's lending library of video materials. The cost of Primary membership dues is $35 annually as of August, 2013. An Associate membership is available to any member of a household in which there is already a Primary member (i.e. a spouse or child of a Primary member). Associate membership is $15 annually and includes all the benefits of membership with the exclusion of receipt of a newsletter.
Chapters.
There are multiple local chapters of the Society. Each chapter is chartered by the RWCS and holds its own meetings and functions throughout the year. Many of them also hold smaller functions in conjunction with the two RWCS sponsored events, the July Convention and the MidWinter GetTogether, held in February. Membership in the RWCS is a requirement for membership in one of its chapters. Chapters often operate much like the Society but on a smaller scale, including the production of chapter commemoratives as a fundraising activity. As of 2008 there were sixteen chapters in the United States.
Golden State Red Wing Chapter founded In 1987 in California.
Annual events.
The RWCS holds two official events every year, the Convention and MidWinter GetTogether.
Convention.
The July Convention is held every year and is the original event of the society. The first convention was held in July 1977 in Red Wing, Minnesota. Since then there has been an annual convention and business meeting of the society in July in Red Wing. The most recent venue has been the Red Wing High School. Educational seminars, an auction, a show and sale, displays of pottery, and children's events are held.
MidWinter GetTogether.
The MidWinter GetTogether is held in February. Meant to be an event that may relocate to new locations if possible, it has been held in Des Moines, Iowa since at least 2003. This is a smaller event than the Convention and is attended by far fewer members. Educational seminars, a show and sale, social events, and children's events are held.
Chapter meetings and events.
Chapters of the RWCS hold meetings throughout the year. Depending on the chapter these meetings may be held anywhere from monthly to four times annually. Some chapters hold annual special events in addition to their regular business meetings.

Nonviolent resistance

Nonviolent resistance (NVR or nonviolent action) is the practice of achieving goals through symbolic protests, civil disobedience, economic or political noncooperation, satyagraha, and other methods, without using violence. It is largely but wrongly taken as synonymous with civil resistance. Each of these terms ("nonviolent resistance" and "civil resistance") has its distinct merits and also quite different connotations and commitments, which are briefly explored in the entry on civil resistance. For instance you can operate non-violence on quite all peaceful fronts of refusals, but on some occasions without denying concurrently the government in activity.
The modern form of non-violent resistance was popularised and proven to be effective by the Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi in his efforts to gain independence from the British.
Major nonviolent resistance advocates include Maori (indigenous New Zealand) leaders Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kakahi, Leo Tolstoy, Martin Luther King, Jr, James Bevel, Václav Havel, Andrei Sakharov, and Lech Wałęsa. There are hundreds of books and papers on the subject — see Further reading below.
From 1966 to 1999 nonviolent civic resistance has played a critical role in 50 of 67 transitions from authoritarianism. Recently, nonviolent resistance has led to the Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Current nonviolent resistance includes the Jeans Revolution in Belarus, the "Jasmine" Revolution in Tunisia, and the fight of the Cuban dissidents.
Many movements which promote philosophies of nonviolence or pacifism have pragmatically adopted the methods of nonviolent action as an effective way to achieve social or political goals. They employ nonviolent resistance tactics such as: information warfare, picketing, vigils, leafletting, samizdat, magnitizdat, satyagraha, protest art, protest music and poetry, community education and consciousness raising, lobbying, tax resistance, civil disobedience, boycotts or sanctions, legal/diplomatic wrestling, underground railroads, principled refusal of awards/honours, and general strikes. Nonviolent action differs from pacifism by potentially being proactive and interventionist.

UNICEF

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF; ) is a United Nations Program headquartered in New York City that provides long-term humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries. It is one of the members of the United Nations Development Group and its Executive Committee.
UNICEF was created by the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children in countries that had been devastated by World War II. In 1953, UNICEF became a permanent part of the United Nations System and its name was shortened from the original United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund but it has continued to be known by the popular acronym based on this previous title.
UNICEF relies on contributions from governments and private donors and UNICEF's total income for 2008 was $3,372,540,239. Governments contribute two thirds of the organization's resources; private groups and some 6 million individuals contribute the rest through the National Committees. It is estimated that 91.8% of their revenue is distributed to Program Services. UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children. UNICEF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 and the Prince of Asturias Award of Concord in 2006.
Most of UNICEF's work is in the field, with staff in over 190 countries and territories. More than 200 country offices carry out UNICEF's mission through a program developed with host governments. Seventeen regional offices provide technical assistance to country offices as needed.
Overall management and administration of the organization takes place at its headquarters in New York. UNICEF's Supply Division is based in Copenhagen and serves as the primary point of distribution for such essential items as vaccines, antiretroviral medicines for children and mothers with HIV, nutritional supplements, emergency shelters, educational supplies, among others. A 36-member Executive Board establishes policies, approves programs and oversees administrative and financial plans. The Executive Board is made up of government representatives who are elected by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, usually for three-year terms.
Following the reaching of term limits by Executive Director of UNICEF Carol Bellamy, former United States Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman became executive director of the organization in May 2005, with an agenda to increase the organization's focus on the Millennium Development Goals. She was succeeded in May 2010, by Anthony Lake.
UNICEF is an intergovernmental organization (IGO) and thus is accountable to those governments. UNICEF’s salary and benefits package is based on the United Nations Common System.
UNICEF National Committees.
There are National Committees in 36 countries worldwide, each established as an independent local non-governmental organization. The National Committees raise funds from the private sector.
UNICEF is not funded exclusively by voluntary contributions, and the National Committee collectively raise around one-third of UNICEF's annual income. This comes through contributions from corporations, civil society organizations around 6 million individual donors worldwide. They also rally many different partners – including the media, national and local government officials, NGOs, specialists such as doctors and lawyers, corporations, schools, young people and the general public – on issues related to children’s rights
Promotion and fundraising.
In the United States, Canada and some other countries, UNICEF is known for its "Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF" program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night, sometimes instead of candy.
UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world, but not involved in 9 others (Bahamas, Brunei, Cyprus, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, and Singapore). UNICEF designated 1979 as the "Year of the Child" and many celebrities including David Gordon, David Essex, Alun Davies and Cat Stevens gave a performance at a benefit concert celebrating the Year of the Child Concert in December 1979.
Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF's work through the activities of 36 National Committees for UNICEF. These non-governmental organizations (NGO) are primarily responsible for fundraising, selling UNICEF greeting cards and products, creating private and public partnerships, advocating for children’s rights, and providing other support. The U.S. Fund for UNICEF is the oldest of the National Committees, founded in 1947.
In 2005, New Zealand appointed 18-year-old Hayley Westenra, a world famous opera and pop singer, as their Ambassador to UNICEF, in an effort to enlist the youth of the world in supporting UNICEF. Westenra has made several trips to visit underprivileged children in developing countries on behalf of UNICEF, in an effort to publicize their plight, and has engaged in fund-raising activities in support of the UNICEF mission.
On 19 April 2007, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg was appointed UNICEF Eminent Advocate for Children, in which role she has visited Brazil (2007), China (2008), and Burundi (2009).
In 2009, the British retailer Tesco used “Change for Good” as advertising, which is trademarked by UNICEF for charity usage but not for commercial or retail use. This prompted the agency to say, "it is the first time in Unicef’s history that a commercial entity has purposely set out to capitalise on one of our campaigns and subsequently damage an income stream which several of our programmes for children are dependent on”. They went on to call on the public “who have children’s welfare at heart, to consider carefully who they support when making consumer choices”.
Sponsorship.
On 7 September 2006, an agreement between UNICEF and the Spanish Catalan association football club FC Barcelona was reached whereby the club would donate 1.5 million euros per year to the organization for five years. As part of the agreement, FC Barcelona will wear the UNICEF logo on the front of their shirts. This is the first time a football club sponsored an organization rather than the other way around. It is also the first time in FC Barcelona's history that they have had another organization's name across the front of their shirts.
In January 2007, UNICEF struck a partnership with Canada's national tent pegging team. The team was officially re-flagged as "UNICEF Team Canada", its riders wear UNICEF's logo in competition, and team members promote and raise funds for UNICEF's campaign against childhood HIV-AIDS. When the team became the 2008 tent pegging world champions, UNICEF's flag was raised alongside the Canadian flag at the games, the first time in the history of international Grand Prix equestrian competition that a non-state flag has flown over the medal podium.
The Swedish club Hammarby IF followed the Spanish and Canadian lead on 14 April 2007, also raising funds for UNICEF and displaying the UNICEF name on their sportswear. The Danish soccer club Brondby IF will do likewise from the summer of 2008.
Australian A-League club Sydney FC announced they would also enter into a partnership with UNICEF raising funds for children in the Asia-Pacific region, and would also display the UNICEF logo for the remainder of the 2011-12 A-League season.
Race driver Jacques Villeneuve has occasionally placed the UNICEF logo on the #27 Bill Davis Racing pickup truck in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.
In Botswana, UNICEF has funded the development of new state-of-the-art HIV/AIDS education for every schoolchild in Botswana from nonprofit organization TeachAIDS.
UNICEF recently announced a landmark partnership with Scottish club Rangers F.C. UNICEF will partner the Rangers Charity Foundation and have pledged to raise £300,000 by 2011.
In 2010, UNICEF created a partnership with Phi Iota Alpha, making them the first Greek Lettered Organization UNICEF has ever worked with. In 2011, Phi Iota Alpha raised over $20,000 for the Tap Project and the Trick or Treats for UNICEF Campaign.
In 2013, they agreed a contract with Greek association football champions Olympiacos F.C. who will don the organization's logo on the front of their shirts.
Trick-or-Treat UNICEF box.
Since 1950, when a group of children in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, donated $17 which they received on Halloween to help post-World War II victims, the Trick-or-Treat UNICEF box has become a tradition in North America during the fall. These small orange boxes are handed to children at schools and other locations before 31 October. , the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign has collected approximately CAD 91 million in Canada and over US$167 million in the U.S.
Cartoons for Children's Rights.
In 1994, UNICEF held a summit encouraging animation studios around the world to create individual animated spots demonstrating the international rights of children. Cartoons for Children's Rights is the collection of animated shorts based on UNICEF’s Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Corporate partnership.
To raise money to support its Education and Literacy Programmes, UNICEF collaborates with companies worldwide – encompassing international as well as small- and medium-sized businesses. Since 2004, the organization has been supported by Montblanc, working colloabratively to help the world’s children getting better access to education.
According to "Vaccine News Daily", Merck & Co. has partnered with UNICEF in June 2013 to decrease maternal mortality, HIV and tuberculosis prevalence in South Africa. Merck's program "Merck for Mothers" will give $500 million worldwide for programs that improve health for expectant mothers and their children.
Corporate Social Responsibility.
UNICEF works directly with companies to improve their business practices, bringing them in line with obligations under international law, and ensuring that they respect children's rights in the realms of the marketplace, workplace and the community. In 2012, UNICEF worked with Save the Children and The UN Global Compact to develop the Children's Rights and Business Principles and now these guidelines form the basis UNICEF's advice to companies. UNICEF works with companies seeking to improve their social sustainability by guiding them through a due diligence process where issues throughout their supply chain, such as child labour, can be identified and actions to ratify them are put in place.
Girl Stars.
The Girl Star project is a series of films which documents stories of girls from the most disadvantaged communities across five Northern states who, through attaining education, have managed to break socio-economic constraints to make a success of their lives and become self-sufficient. These young women have grown to become role models in their communities, inspiring younger girls to go to school and continue their education. They have selected professions from the most conventional such as teaching and nursing, to the most unconventional like archery, bee-keeping, scrap management, often entering what has traditionally been a man’s domain.
Facilities.
UNICEF World Warehouse.
The old UNICEF World Warehouse is a large facility in Denmark, which hosts UNICEF deliverable goods as well as co-hosts emergency goods for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). Until 2012 the housing facilities was a 25,000m2 warehouse at Marmormolen in Copenhagen. With construction of a 45,000m2 UN City that is to house all UN activities in Copenhagen under one roof, the warehouse service has been relocated to outer parts of Copenhagen Freeport. In addition to the goods, the facility houses the UNICEF Supply Division which manages strategic transport hubs in Dubai, Panama and Shanghai. The warehouse contains a variety of items, e.g., special food supplies like the Plumpy'nut, water purification tablets, dietary and vitamin supplements, and the "School in a box" (illustrated above).
On 2 November 2011, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, with The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, visited the warehouse to highlight the crisis in East Africa.
UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre.
UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre in Florence, Italy, was established in 1988, to strengthen the research capability of the United Nations Children's Fund and to support its advocacy for children worldwide.
The centre, formally known as the International Child Development Centre, has as its prime objectives to improve international understanding of issues relating to children's rights, to promote economic policies that advance the cause of children, and to help facilitate the full implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in industrialized and developing countries.
The programme for 2006–2008 was approved by UNICEF Executive Board in September 2005. It reaffirms the centre's academic freedom and the focus of IRC's research on knowledge gaps, emerging questions and sensitive issues which are relevant to the realization of children's rights, in developing and industrialized countries. It capitalizes on IRC's role as an interface between UNICEF field experience, international experts, research networks and policy makers and is designed to strengthen the centre's institutional collaboration with regional academic and policy institutions, pursuing the following goals:
Three interrelated strategies will guide the achievement of these goals:
Controversies.
NSA surveillance.
Documents of Edward Snowden showed in December 2013 that British and American intelligence agencies surveillance targets with America's National Security Agency (NSA) included organisations such as the UN's children's charity UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme, Médecins Sans Frontières and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).
Criticism.
UNICEF has been criticized at times for its focus or for specific policies. In 2004, the editorial in the Lancet argued that UNICEF's rights-based approach to child welfare, based upon the Convention on the Rights of the Child, whilst in accordance with international development policy, leads to a lower emphasis on child survival and mortality. One reason that UNICEF has such a poor track record regarding child survival and mortality is its policy of preferring that children stay in orphanages in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents. Psychologists and scientists have rejected such prioritization of "cultural heritage" over the love of a family, however. International adoptions all over the world have plummeted since UNICEF has taken an increasingly active role in discouraging international adoption in the past 15 years, despite reliable estimates that there are at least 10 million adoptable orphans in need of families.
Recently, major news outlets such as US News have begun to investigate UNICEF's practice of giving huge cash payments to developing countries in exchange for their closure of their international adoption programs, and have even labeled UNICEF a "villain" for the extent of its negative impact on orphans. Elizabeth Bartholet and Paulo Barrozo have written in this context, encouraging adoption protocols to take on a more child-centric viewpoint.
One great concern is that the child mortality rate has not decreased in some areas and has actually increased. The highest rates were found in sub-Saharan Africa. This was difficult to understand, but even more concerning was that “over 60% of these deaths were and remain preventable.” 
There was an estimated 19,000 children that died every day in 2011. It is important to recognize that “overall the least developed countries have consistently had higher rates of under-5 Mortality than more affluent countries.” (Currie, 1) Not only are these deaths preventable but the coverage levels for these interventions are “appallingly low in the 42 countries that account for 90% of child deaths.”

2007 Alum Rock earthquake

The 2007 Alum Rock earthquake occurred on October 30, 2007 at approximately 8:04 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time (October 31, 3:04 a.m. UTC) in Alum Rock Park in San Jose, California. It measured 5.6 on the moment magnitude scale and had a depth of .
The Alum Rock earthquake was the largest in the San Francisco Bay Area since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale. Ground shaking from the Alum Rock quake reached San Francisco and Oakland and other points further north.
ElarmS, an earthquake early warning system, accurately predicted the quake seconds before it struck, correctly estimating the quake's magnitude to within 0.5 magnitude units using only three to four seconds worth of data. Scientists with the California Integrated Seismic Network hope to refine the system to provide a 10-second warning in a similar quake to residents of Oakland and San Francisco.
Geology.
The quake originated on the Calaveras Fault. 60,000 felt reports existed far beyond Santa Rosa. The earthquake ruptured an area of the fault for a length of about beginning at the hypocenter and extending southeast. No surface trace of the earthquake along the fault.
Damage.
The earthquake caused minor damage, such as knocking things off of shelves, but caused no casualties. The shaking was felt as far north as Eugene, Oregon. Some parts of the area felt the rupture for up to 15 seconds.
David Oppenheimer, a seismologist at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), said that although the quake was felt as a strong jolt over a wide region, it was more significant because it caused stress changes in the Calaveras Fault and the nearby Hayward Fault.

Lydia Maria Adams DeWitt

Lydia Maria Adams DeWitt, born Lydia Maria Adams (February 1, 1859 – March 10, 1928) was an American pathologist and anatomist.
Early life and education.
Lydia Maria Adams was born in Flint, Michigan to Oscar and Elizabeth Adams (née Walton), the second of three children. Her father was an attorney. Elizabeth died when Lydia was five, leaving her sister, who later married Oscar, to raise Lydia and her siblings.
Adams completed her primary education in the Flint public school system. She became a teacher, then studied at the Michigan State Normal School (also called the Ypsilanti Normal School) and married her colleague Alton D. DeWitt in 1878. They had two children, Stella, born in 1879, and Clyde, born in 1880. The family moved several times during this period as Alton obtained different jobs in the Michigan public school system; Lydia taught at a variety of public schools.
Career and research.
In 1895, she began medical studies at the University of Michigan; she earned her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1898 and Bachelor of Science degree in 1899. Lydia and Alton DeWitt separated during this time. DeWitt remained at University of Michigan for the beginning of her career in research. She held a position under George Dock as a demonstrator of anatomy from 1896-1897, while she was still studying medicine, then became an assistant professor of histology until 1902, and associate professor of histology from 1902-1910. She took a brief sabbatical to study at the University of Berlin in 1906. That year, she was starred in the first edition of "American Men of Science" for her notable work in microscopic anatomy and neuroanatomy. In 1910, DeWitt began to work at Washington University in St. Louis as an instructor of pathology, and also took a post in the St. Louis Department of Health as a pathologist/bacteriologist. Her research there was so noted that she was invited to join the faculty of the University of Chicago to work on chemotherapy for tuberculosis, which she did in 1912. She was an assistant professor of pathology there until 1918, when she was elevated to associate professor. She retired in 1926.
As a woman scientist, DeWitt was excluded from the Faculty Research Club and the Junior Faculty Research Club at the University of Michigan. In response, she founded and headed the Women's Research Club in 1902.
DeWitt's research career covered a variety of topics and organ systems, including the pathology of tuberculosis. She studied muscles extensively, in their pathology and nervous connections, as well as the disease myositis ossificans. Other topics of her research included esophageal anatomy, membranous dysmenorrhea, and the anatomy of connections in the mammalian heart. Her early research, at the University of Michigan, concerned the structure of nerve endings in both sensory nerves and motor nerves of striated muscle and smooth muscle. This also included studies of muscle spindles, which were published in 1897, before she finished her medical studies. Her first solo research was published in 1901 and concerned the pyloric glands and their structure in different species. While at the St. Louis Department of Health, she conducted extensive research on diphtheria and diagnosis of typhoid. Her work on isolating the islets of Langerhans cells from the pancreas and her discovery that they secreted a substance involved in carbohydrate metabolism set the stage for the discovery of insulin and its role in diabetes by a Canadian team of researchers. At the University of Chicago, DeWitt and her team worked on developing a drug to treat tuberculosis based on the work of Paul Erlich, who developed a treatment for syphilis by chemically modifying a dye that would stain parasites. Working with Hope Sherman, Gladys Leavell, and Lauretta Bender, among others, DeWitt examined several dyes as potential precursors to an anti-tuberculosis drug, including methylene blue and trypan red. This research did not bear fruit immediately, though the method was later used successfully to develop a chemotherapy for tuberculosis, and as a model for developing other drugs.
Honors.
In 1902, DeWitt joined the Association of American Anatomists. In 1914, she received an honorary Master's degree from the University of Michigan, her "alma mater". DeWitt was the president of the Chicago Pathological Society from 1924-1925. The American Medical Association elected her an associate fellow. She was also a member of the Michigan Medical Society and the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists.
Death and legacy.
DeWitt died at the age of 69 in Winters, Texas at the home of her daughter, of her chronic health problems (arteriosclerosis and hypertension). A research grant to support women scientists at the University of Michigan bears her name.

Gang wars between Chota Rajan and Dawood Ibrahim

Rajendra Sadashiv Nikhalje (Chotta Rajan's real name), was the sword arm of don Dawood Ibrahim till the two parted ways over the latter’s role in the Bombay blasts. Differences had arisen in 1992 itself after Dawood henchman Subhash Thakur killed three Chhota Rajan groupies. But after the blasts, they fell out completely, with Rajan positioning himself as a ‘patriotic don’ not wanting to betray his country, and challenging the hegemony of Dawood as a “people’s gangster”. Over a hundred men have been eliminated in five years since the inter-gang rivalry started in Mumbai. Some top D Company sharp shooters like Mohan Kuttian, Sadhu Shetty and Jaspal Singh too abandoned ship along with Chhota Rajan, who fled Dubai, Dawood’s stronghold, after the bitter parting of ways. Turf battles in Mumbai took the shape of tit-for-tat killings. In June 1995, the D Company killed hotelier Ramanath Payyade, who paid protection money to Chhota Rajan. Earlier, they killed film producer Mukesh Duggal, who was reportedly an associate of Chhota Rajan. The latter served notice of his challenge to Dawood’s supremacy by killing ace sharp-shooter Sunil Sawant in August. Dawood’s retribution was swift and brutal. He got builder O P Kukreja, Chhota Rajan’s friend, gunned down. The challenger responded by getting East West Airlines managing director, Thakiyuddin Wahid, bumped off by hired killers in November 1995. But the most sensational killing was that of Mirza Dilshad Beg, Nepal MP and one time minister, who was reportedly a point man for Dawood in Nepal. In triumphant interviews to the media, Rajan claimed the scalp and said that the Indian intelligence agencies were aware of the plan to kill Beg, who was wanted by India for subversive activity.
Chota Rajan is believed to have assisted intelligence agencies in getting a low down on the activities of the D Company and its members using his intimate knowledge of the gang and its operations. To demonstrate his claims of being a Hindu don, Rajan threatened to kill those accused of engineering the Bombay bomb blasts. The most prominent accused to be killed was Saleem Kurla in April 1998, followed by Mohammad Jindran in June 1998 and Majid Khan on March 1, 1999. The D Company retaliated by killing Shiv Sena pramukh Mohammad Saleem. The Shiv Sena, which ruled Maharashtra along with the BJP from 1994 to 1999, is believed to have a soft corner for the ‘Hindu Don’. It is alleged that selective police action against the Dawood gangsters during the Shiv Sena regime and their elimination in encounters helped strengthen Rajan’s position, just as Dawood himself had benefitted in the 1980s. The Sena laid bare its affection for Chota Rajan in an editorial in Saamna, its mouthpiece, edited by Bal Thackeray. The editorial heaved a sigh of relief, attributing Chota rajan’s survival to “good fortune’’. Saamna alleges that Pakistani ISI was behind the move to kill Chota Rajan.
In February 2010, Chotta Rajan gang assassinated Jamim Shah, a third-generation Nepali media baron of Muslim Kashmiri origin. Shah allegedly had links with Dawood Ibrahim and Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and was the kingpin of a racket producing fake Indian money in the Himalayan nation. His anti-India activities had rankled New Delhi for more than a decade and half.
