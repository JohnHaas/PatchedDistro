Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal

Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal (TGT) is a large gas terminal on the Lincolnshire coast on "Mablethorpe Road" at Theddlethorpe St Helen close to Mablethorpe in East Lindsey in England. It is just off the A1031 and next door to a holiday camp and Mablethorpe Seal Sanctuary (Animal Gardens).
History.
From December 1969, there were plans for the terminal proposed by the Gas Council. Planning permission was given in April 1970. It was built in 1972 to receive gas from the Viking gas field from 4 July 1972, being the UK's third main gas terminal when owned by Conoco. The first stage cost around £5 million. A new offshore gas pipeline had to be built for the plant. It was originally called the Viking Gas Terminal, changing to its current name in 1984.
In the early 1990s, a new pipeline was built to the terminal by Kinetica, a company jointly owned by PowerGen and Conoco. The pipeline to Killingholme was opened by Tim Eggar on 21 July 1992.
Operation.
The main site is owned by ConocoPhillips, with pipelines to National Grid's National Transmission System, and E.ON's Killingholme Pipeline System to both units at the Killingholme Power Station, transporting 256,000 m3/h at a pressure of 40-55 bar. 10% of the UK's ever increasing gas requirements come from Theddlethorpe. Around one hundred people work on the site.
Offshore pipeline systems.
These are in the areas known as the UK Southern Gas Basin or Southern North Sea Basin. This is part of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS).
Natural gas liquids.
Any liquids from the refinery operation get transferred to Phillips 66's (previously ConocoPhillip's when the two companies were one) Humber Refinery next door to the Killingholme Power Station (ICHP), twenty six miles away to the north-west of Theddlethorpe.
Gas fields.
Viking.
The main field that connects to the terminal is the Viking gas field, via the Viking Transportation System. It is off the Lincolnshire coast, and is in two sections - Viking A and Viking B. It is 50% owned by ConocoPhillips. Production on the North Viking Field began in July 1972 and South Viking in August 1973 after the North Viking field was discovered in March 1969 and South Viking in December 1968. It was initially operated by Conoco and the National Coal Board, then by ConocoPhillips on behalf of BP (former Britoil), and was jointly owned by both. It is close to the Indefatigable field, and a plan was to use the (nearer) Bacton gas plant instead. Production from the Viking gas field was the main incentive to build the Theddlethorpe site.

1958 VFL Grand Final

The 1958 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Melbourne Football Club and Collingwood Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 20 September 1958. It was the 62nd annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1958 VFL season. The match, attended by 97,956 spectators, was won by Collingwood by 18 points, marking that club's 13th premiership victory. 
This was Melbourne's fifth successive Grand Final appearance. The Demons had won the previous three premierships and were looking to equal Collingwood's 1927–1930 Premiership record. Collingwood's victory would deny the Demons that record and keep it in black-and-white hands, a record which still stands today.

Sibsey Trader Mill

Trader Mill is located in the village of Sibsey, Lincolnshire. It one of two windmills which were grinding flour for the local community. Rhodes Mill (the second of the two) has been converted into a house. Built in 1877 by Saunderson of Louth in the typical Lincolnshire style, since then it has been restored and is now owned by English Heritage and managed by an independent party. It is a six storey windmill with complete gear, six sails and fantail which still works today. It is a Grade I listed building.
The windmill is one of the very few six-sailed mills still remaining in England.
The mill itself is not exceptionally tall and in fact stands only six floors high above ground and the height to the top of the mill's cap is a mere 74 feet 3 inches. However the slenderness of the tower combined with the flat landscape which surrounds the mill give the illusion that Sibsey is larger than it actually is. The slim central tower also makes the sails look enormous in comparison.
The mill worked until 1954 (although with only four sails in its later years) following which it was allowed to fall into disrepair. It has now been restored to full working order and today produces a wide range of organic flours.
The mill features in the CBeebies series Baby Jake where location filming for the series took place in the late summer of 2010.

<doc id="19557663" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19557663" title="Unified growth theory">
Unified growth theory

Unified growth theory was developed to address the inability of endogenous growth theory to explain key empirical regularities in the growth processes of individual economies and the world economy as a whole. Endogenous growth theory was satisfied with accounting for empirical regularities in the growth process of developed economies over the last hundred years. As a consequence it was not able to explain the qualitatively different empirical regularities that characterized the growth process over longer time horizons in both developed and less developed economies. Unified growth theories are endogenous growth theories that are consistent with the entire process of development, and in particular the transition from the epoch of Malthusian stagnation that had characterized most of the process of development to the contemporary era of sustained economic growth.
Unified growth theory was first advanced by Oded Galor and his co-authors who were able to characterize in a single dynamical system an initial stable Malthusian equilibrium which due to the evolution of latent state variables, ultimately vanishes endogenously, causing a transitional growth take off before the system gradually converges to a modern growth steady-state equilibrium. The Malthusian state is characterized by slow technological progress and population growth, where the benefits of technological progress are offset by population growth. In the modern growth state technological progress does not encourage population growth but human capital accumulation instead which then further spurs technological progress.
The theory captures in a single analytical framework the main characteristics of the process of development: (i) the epoch of Malthusian stagnation that characterized most of human history, (ii) the escape from the Malthusian trap, (iii) the emergence of human capital formation in the process of development, (iv) the onset of the demographic transition, (v) the origins of the contemporary era of sustained economic growth, and (vi) the divergence in income per capita across countries.
Unified growth theory suggests that the transition from stagnation to growth has been an inevitable by-product of the process of development. It argues that the inherent Malthusian interaction between the rate of technological progress and the size and composition of the population accelerated the pace of technological progress and ultimately raised the importance of education in coping with the rapidly changing technological environment. The rise in industrial demand for education brought about significant reductions in fertility rates. It enabled economies to divert a larger share of the gains from factor accumulation and technological progress to the enhancement of human capital formation and income per capita, paving the way for the emergence of sustained economic growth.
The theory further explores the dynamic interaction between human evolution and the process of economic development and advances the hypothesis that the forces of natural selection played a significant role in the evolution of the world economy from stagnation to growth. The Malthusian pressures have acted as the key determinant of population size and conceivably, via natural selection, have shaped the composition of the population as well. Lineages of individuals whose traits were complementary to the economic environment generated higher levels of income, and thus a larger number of surviving offspring, and the gradual increase in the representation of their traits in the population contributed to the process of development and the take-off from stagnation to growth.
Unified Growth Theory sheds light on the divergence in income per capita across the globe during the past two centuries. It identifies the factors that have governed the transition from stagnation to growth and have thus contributed to the observed worldwide differences in economic development. It highlights the persistent effects that variations in historical and prehistorical conditions have had on the composition of human capital and economic development across countries. Finally, it uncovers the forces that have led to the emergence of convergence clubs.

Hapoel Yehud F.C.

Hapoel Yehud () was an Israeli football club based in Yehud. They spent eight seasons in the top division in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and won the State Cup in 1982.
History.
The club was founded in 1950. In 1973 Hapoel won the 25 Years of Independence Cup for second tier teams, beating Hapoel Ramat Gan 2–0 in the final.
The club was first promoted to the top division as Liga Alef champions in 1976. In their first season in Liga Leumit they finished 7th. The following season they finished fourth, a performance repeated in 1979–80. In 1981–82 they narrowly avoided relegation, finishing one place above the drop zone. In the same season the club reached the final of the State Cup for the first (and only) time, where they beat Hapoel Tel Aviv 1–0.
However, two seasons later, the club finished bottom of the table and were relegated to Liga Artzit. In 1989 they dropped into Liga Alef (then the third tier), and in 1992 were relegated to Liga Bet. Although they briefly returned to Liga Alef, the club was relegated back to Liga Bet, and folded in 1998.
During their years in the top division the club became well known for its defensive style of play, referred to in Hebrew as "bunker", and specialisation in 0–0 draws. In all but their final season in Liga Leumit the club drew more matches than it won or lost, and had a consistently good defensive record (the best defence in 1980–81 and the second best in 1976–77 and 1981–82). The club is still remembered for its lack of goal action and low-scoring football tournaments are met with the comment "Hapoel Yehud scores more".
In 2004 a new club, Hapoel Ironi Yehud was formed and played in Liga Gimel. the new club folded in the summer of 2009.

Orlando Campos

Orlando "Ollie" Campos (1925–1994) was an Indian bridge player.
Campos was the mainstay of the famous Ruia team that dominated the Indian bridge scene from 1958 through the late seventies. He represented India in seven world championships and two zonal championships. His 22 national wins include open teams twice and open pairs once. He has been featured in many bridge publications, the most recent being a hand featured in the book "Easier Done Than Said: Brilliancy at the Bridge Table" by Dr. Prakash K. Paranjape. His most frequent partner was Ashok Ruia.
"Ollie", as he was popularly known was a fine technician and also one of the fastest players in the world. For a long time he held the record for the highest number of masterpoints in India.
Personal anecdotes.
Besides playing bridge, Campos also used to direct the game where he is fondly remembered for his ability to do matchpoint scores in "double-fast time." One of the funny memories of him is his tendency to relapse into, "Sorry, my fault – I am a palooka, you are expert," whenever he got riled by his partner.
On the way to a bridge event that he was attending, Ollie's flight got hijacked (c. 1984). Ultimately the hijackers were attacked by commandoes, but at age 70+, Ollie was reportedly one of the first passengers to have escaped down the emergency chute.
He was a keen amateur philatelist whose specialization was "Early Indian First Day Cancellations."

Spartacus Trial

The Spartacus Maxi-Trial (Italian: Processo Spartacus) was a series of criminal trials that were specifically directed against the activities of the powerful Casalesi clan of the Camorra. The trial was opened at the Corte d'Assise of Santa Maria Capua Vetere in Caserta. It was named after the historical gladiator, Spartacus, who led a rebellion of slaves beginning near Vesuvius against the ancient Roman Empire. It was named as such, in recognition of the need to fight a revolt in the Casalesi clan's territory. The trial was initially chaired by its president, Catello Marano on July 1, 1998. It continued until June 19, 2008, when its final verdict was eventually read.
The 10-year legal trial, charged 36 members of the clan with a string of murders and other crimes. The Casalesi clan exploited and extorted from every business and economic opportunity, from waste disposal to construction, to creating a monopoly in the cement market for their own building businesses to the distribution of materials. Building business would have to pay for the contracts, buy material from the clan and keep paying for protection. The clan also controlled elections.
All defendants were found guilty and 16 sentenced to life imprisonment including prominent Casalesi bosses, Francesco Schiavone aka ""Sandokan"", and his chief lieutenant, Francesco Bidognetti. The other two bosses Antonio Iovine and Michele Zagaria were also given life sentences. However, at the time they were fugitives and are still absconding. They were on the list of most wanted fugitives in Italy, with international warrants for their arrest. (Antonio Iovine was arrested on November 17, 2010, in Casal di Principe) The other Casalesi clan members who received the life sentences were: Giuseppe Caterino, Cipriano D'Alessandro, Enrico Martinelli, Sebastiano Panaro, Giuseppe Russo, Walter Schiavone, Luigi Venosa, Vincenzo Zagaria, Alfredo Zara, Mario Caterino and Raffaele Diana.
More than 1300 people were investigated, 508 witnesses gave evidence and 626 were interviewed in the trial which saw the heaviest penalties ever for organised crime with a total of 700 years of imprisonment. Over the course of the initial trial and the appeal, five people involved in the case were murdered, including a court interpreter. A judge and two journalists were threatened with death. In all, 115 people were prosecuted, 27 life sentences, plus 750 years in prison were handed out to the defendants. On January 15, 2010, Italy's Supreme Court confirmed the sentence.

Leslie Arden

Leslie Arden is a Canadian musical theatre composer, lyricist and librettist. She has been described as "arguably Canada's most talented Musical Theatre writer". She is best known for her work "The House of Martin Guerre" (co-book by Anna Theresa Cascio) produced by Theatre Plus (1993), the Goodman Theatre (1996) in Chicago and the Canadian Stage Company (1997). Her musical "The Boys are Coming Home" was part of the American Music Theatre Project at North Western University and was showcased by the National Alliance of Musical Theatre in New York City. Theatre critic Richard Ouzanian says she is "the creator of some of the most sophisticated work on our stages". The Toronto Star has commented that her work is “beautifully crafted” and USA Today states she is a “major talent”. She also wrote the Chalmers Award-winning "The Happy Prince". She collaborated with esteemed Canadian playwright Norm Foster for her latest musical "Ned Durango". It had its world premiere at Theatre Orangeville in May 2011.
Early life.
She was born Leslie Arden Jenkins in Beverly Hills, California to Canadian singer Cleone Duncan and her American performer husband, Paul Howard Jenkins. Her parents moved to Toronto and divorced when she was 6 years old. Arden says: "I was an only child and all my parents worked, so I spent a great deal of time on my own. I grew up liking dark things and high stakes and real drama."
Her mother, Cleone Duncan, was a theatre actress who performed many years in the Canadian musical hit Anne of Green Gables - The Musical.
Education.
Early in her career she took classes with Lehman Engel, who had been a musical director for over 100 Broadway productions, in Toronto. In 1990, she was chosen along with 12 other participants to study with legendary musical theatre composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim at Oxford University. The sessions were organized by theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh.
Currently.
She is the Artistic Director and co-founder of The Children’s Trio, a company dedicated to theatre for young audiences. She is currently playwright-in-residence at the renowned Stratford Festival of Canada and is working on a new musical for Lorraine Kimsa Theatre for Young People. She is also working on a new musical about Moll Flanders.

<doc id="19557982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19557982" title="Default mode network">
Default mode network

In neuroscience, the default mode network is a network of brain regions that are active when the individual is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest. Also called the default network, default state network, or task-negative network (TNN), it is characterized by coherent neuronal oscillations at a rate lower than 0.1 Hz (one every ten seconds). During goal-oriented activity, the DMN is deactivated and another network, the task-positive network (TPN) is activated. The default network may correspond to task-independent introspection, or self-referential thought, while the TPN corresponds to action, and that perhaps the TNN and TPN may be "considered elements of a single default network with anti-correlated components".
Anatomy.
The default mode network is an interconnected and anatomically defined brain system that preferentially activates when individuals engage in internal tasks such as daydreaming, envisioning the future, retrieving memories, and gauging others' perspectives. It is negatively correlated with brain systems that focus on external visual signals. Its subsystems include part of the medial temporal lobe for memory, part of the medial prefrontal cortex for theory of mind, and the posterior cingulate cortex for integration, along with the adjacent ventral precuneus and the medial, lateral and inferior parietal cortex. In the infant brain, there is limited evidence of the default network, but default network connectivity is more consistent in children aged 9–12 years, suggesting that the default network undergoes developmental change.
Function.
In humans, the default mode network has been hypothesized to generate spontaneous thoughts during mind-wandering and may relate to creativity. Alternatively, default mode activity may represent underlying physiological processes going on in the brain that are unrelated to any particular thought or thoughts. It has been hypothesized to be relevant to disorders including Alzheimer's disease, autism, and schizophrenia. In particular, reduced default network activity has been associated with autism, overactivity with schizophrenia, and the default network is preferentially attacked by the buildup of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. Lower connectivity was found across the default network in people who have experienced long term trauma, such as childhood abuse. Among people experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder, lower activation was found in the posterior cingulate gyrus compared to controls (Dr. Ruth Lanius, Brain Mapping conference, London, November 2010). The posterior cingulate gyrus discerns emotional and self-relevant information; this interacts with the anterior cingulate gyrus, which integrates emotional information with cognition; and the medial prefrontal cortex, which allows for self-reflection and the regulation of emotion and arousal. This appears to correlate with the experience of people who have experienced long-term trauma and describe feeling 'dead inside' or have a fragmented sense of self or enter dissociative states. Children who have been traumatised often lack an inner world of imagination and show little symbolic play, this too is likely to be due to interruptions across the default network. Meditation practice may be associated with increased default mode network connectivity. Impaired control of entering and leaving the default network state is correlated with old age.
The idea of a "default network" is not universally accepted. In 2007 the concept of the default mode was criticized as not being useful for understanding brain function, on the grounds that a simpler hypothesis is that a resting brain actually does more processing than a brain doing certain "demanding" tasks, and that there is no special significance to the intrinsic activity of the resting brain.
History.
Hans Berger, the inventor of the electroencephalogram was the first to propose the idea that the brain is constantly busy. In a series of papers published in 1929 he showed that the electrical oscillations detected by his device do not cease even when the subject is at rest. However his ideas were not taken seriously and a general perception formed among neurologists that only when a focused activity is performed does the brain (or a part of the brain) become active.
Later, experiments by neurologist Marcus E. Raichle's lab at Washington University School of Medicine and other groups showed that the brain's energy consumption is increased by less than 5% of its baseline energy consumption while performing a focused mental task. These experiments showed that the brain is constantly active with a high level of activity even when the person is not engaged in focused mental work. Research thereafter focused on finding the regions responsible for this constant background activity level.
Raichle coined the term "default mode" in 2001 to describe resting state brain function; the concept rapidly became a central theme in neuroscience. The brain has other Low Frequency Resting State Networks (LFRSNs), such as visual and auditory networks.

Renault KJ

The Renault KJ was a compact car or small family car automobile manufactured by Renault from 1923 to 1924.
Details and Evolutions.
The Renault KJ was presented at the Mondial de l'Automobile in Paris in 1923, the project was created and designed by Louis Renault. A car of the medium social class, its competitors were the Peugeot Quadrilette and the Citroen Type C, the Renault KJ was mechanically similar to the Renault Type MT, but it had a nautic style body or skiff or boattail style. 
Like almost all Renaults up till this time, the car used a cone based clutch, combined with a three speed manual transmission as on the old pre-war 10CV. The brakes only affected the rear wheels. The prominent "gills" on the sides of the bonnet/hood reflected the positioning of the radiator behind the engine.
In 1924 Renault ceased production of this model and replaced it with the Renault NN.

<doc id="19558072" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19558072" title="Toponymy of Bergen, New Netherland">
Toponymy of Bergen, New Netherland

Bergen was part of the 17th century colony of New Netherland centered around Fort Amsterdam in what is now northeastern New Jersey. Placenames in most cases had their roots in Algonquian language Lenape and Dutch.
At the time of European settlement it was the territory of the Acquackanonk Raritan, Tappan, and Hackensack Indians. The Munsee lived in its northwestern reaches (Highlands), while the Wappinger lived to the northeast (Hudson Valley) and the Canarsee and Reckgawawanc lived to the east. The definition of these groups as they are known today is often from the perception of the colonizing population, who tended to call the existing people by the name of a location within their territory, thus creating an exonym. Both the Lenape and Dutch often gave names inspired by the geography or geology of the natural environment and described a shape, location, feature, quality, or phenomenon.
The Lenape were without a written language. The "Swannikens", or "Salt Water People" (as the Europeans were called), used the Latin alphabet to write down the words they heard from the "Wilden" (as the Lenape were called). These approximations were no doubt greatly influenced by Dutch, which was the lingua franca of the multilingual province. Some names still exist in their altered form, their current spelling (and presumably pronunciation) having evolved over the last four centuries into American English.
In some cases it cannot be confirmed, or there is contention, as to whether the roots are in the Dutch or the Lenape, as sources do not always concur. In others, the meaning of the Lenape can have several interpretations. Locative suffixes vary depending on the dialect (usually Munsee or Unami) of the Lenape that prevailed.
"Acquackanonk".
Name of an Unami group who lived along and between the banks of the Passaic Neck and the name of one of state's first townships, established in 1683. Meaning "a place in a rapid stream where fishing is done with a net", Alternatively, "at the lamprey stream" from contemporary "axkwaakahnung". Spellings include "Achquakanonk", "Acquackanonk","Auchaquackanock", "Ackquekenon" 
"Achter Col".
Called "Meghgectecock" by the Lenape this described the area around Newark Bay and the rivers that flowed into it. Neither are longer in use. "Achter", meaning behind, and "kol", meaning neck, can be translated as the "back (of the) peninsula", in this case Bergen Neck.
Variations include "Achter Kol", "Achter Kull", "Archer Col", "Achter Kull" 
"Arresick".
A tidal island, site of first ferry landing for the patroonship Pavonia, which became Paulus Hook.
Spellings include, and "Arressechhonk' and "Aresick" meaning "burial ground" 
"Arthur Kill".
Tidal strait separating Staten Island from the mainland. From "kille" meaning "water channel" such as "riverbed", "rivulet", or "stream" . Likely to have evolved from "Achter Col", the name given by the New Netherlanders for area surrounding Newark Bay and waters that flowed into it, as English language speakers immigrated to the region radiating from the Elizabethtown Tract and Perth Amboy.
"Bedloe's Island".
Now known as Liberty Island, under Dutch sovereignty the island became the property of Isaack Bedloo, merchant and "select burgher" of New Amsterdam, and one of 94 signers of the "Remonstrance of the People of New Netherlands to the Director-General and Council".
"Bergen".
There are various opinions as to the naming of "Bergen". Some say that it so called for Bergen op Zoom in the Netherlands or the city in Norway Others believe it comes from the word "bergen", which in the Germanic languages of northern Europe means hills, and could describe a most distinct geological feature of the region, The Palisades. Yet another interpretation is that it comes from the Dutch verb "bergen", meaning "to save" or "to recover", or noun "place of safety" inspired by the settlers return after they had fled attacks by the native population after the Peach Tree War.
"Caven Point".
The Caven Point settlement at Minkakwa on the west shore of the Upper New York Bay between Pamrapo and Communipaw was part of Pavonia, and now part of Liberty State Park. The name Caven is an anglicisation of the Dutch word "Kewan", which in turn was a "Batavianized" derivative of an Algonquian word meaning peninsula.
"Communipaw".
Site of summer encampament and counsel fire of the Hackensack, its complete meaning has been lost.
Spellings include "Gamoenapa,""Gemonepan," "Gemoenepaen," "Gamenepaw", "Comounepaw", "Comounepan" Communipau, Goneuipan
From "gamunk", "on the other side of the river", and "pe-auke", "water-land", meaning "big landing-place from the other side of the river".
Contemporary: "gamuck" meaning "other side of the water" or "otherside of the river" or "landing place at the side of a river" 
Site of first ""bouwerie"" built at Pavonia and called Jan de Lacher's Hoeck
some have suggested that it comes from "Community of Pauw", which likely is more a coincidence that a fact.
"Constable Hook".
A land grant to Jacob Jacobsen Roy who was a chief gunner or constable in Fort Amsterdam in New Amsterdam in 1646, by the Dutch West India Company, under the leadership of Director-General William Kieft. "Konstapel's Hoeck" in Dutch, takes its name from Roy's title.
A "hoek" or "hoeck" in Dutch meaning a spit of land or small peninsula. Though not used, could be translated to English as "Gunner's Point."
"Cromakill".
Likely from "kromme kille" meaning "crooked creek", border between Secaucus and North Bergen. Similar to evolution of 
"Gramercy", which is a corruption of the "krom mesje", or "little crooked knife," the name of a small brook that flowed along what is now 21st Street in Manhattan.
"Cresskill".
From the "watercress" that grew in its streams, or "kills" 
"Deep Voll".
"Diepte Voll", which literally translates to "Deep Fall", to describe the brook's numerous waterfalls and steep slopes. Known as "Muksukemuk" to the Lenape
"Dwars Kill".
Alternatively "Dwarskill" or "Dwarskill Creek", a tributary of the Oradell Reservoir meaning "cross creek"
"Dunkerhook".
Small section of suburban Paramus reputed to be the former site of a "slave community." According to local histories and an historic marker at the site, Dunkerhook was once home to a population of African Americans, many or all of whom were slaves, as well as a "slave school" and "slave church." However, primary historic documentation establishes that Dunkerhook was populated not by slaves, but rather primarily by free African Americans.
"English Neighborhood".
The former Ridgefield Township in southeastern Bergen County was likely so called the "English Township" because of the settlers who came to reside there who were not New Netherlander, namely many English language speakers from the West Indies and New England
"Hackensack".
The meadowlands, river and city, the Lenape group and their territory, take their name from site of semi-permanent encampment on the neck between the river and Overpeck Creek, near the Teaneck Ridge.
Variously translated as "place of stony ground" or "place of sharp ground".
Spellings include "Ahkingeesahkuy", "Achsinnigeu-haki, Achinigeu-hach, Ack-kinkas-hacky, Achkinhenhcky, Ackingsah-sack, Ackinckeshacky,
"Hackinsack""
Alternatively, suggested as the "place where two rivers come together on low ground" or "stream which discharges itself into another on the level ground", which would speak to the confluence of the Hackensack and Overpeck Creek or Passaic River.
"Harsimus".
Meaning is not clear, possibly "Crow's Marsh". Site of a seasonal Hackensack encampment and one of first ""bouweries"" built by Dutch settlers at Pavonia.
Spellings include: "Aharsimus","Ahasimus","Hasymes", "Haassemus, Hahassemes, Hasimus, Horseemes", "Hasseme", "Horsimus" 
Contemporary: "ahas" meaning "crow" 
"Haverstraw".
One of the first locales to appear on maps of North America, listed as "Haverstroo", which means "oat straw".
"Hoboken".
"Tobacco pipe," from "hoopookum" or "hupoken" 
Most likely to refer to the soapstone collected there to carve tobacco pipes, in a phrase that became "Hopoghan Hackingh" or "place of stone for the tobacco pipe"
Contemporary: "Hopoakan" meaning "pipe for smoking"
Alternatively from "Hoebuck", old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point Variations used during the colonial era included "Hobock","Hobocan", "Hoboocken", and "Hobuck". Although the spelling "Hoboken" was used by the English as early as 1668, it doesn't appear that until Col. John Steven purchased the land on which the city is situated that it became common.
Some would believe the city to named after European town of the same name. The Flemish Hoboken, annexed in 1983 to Antwerp, Belgium, is derived from Middle Dutch "Hooghe Buechen" or "Hoge Beuken", meaning "High Beeches" or "Tall Beeches". Established in 1135, the New Netherlanders were likely aware of its existence (and may have pronounced the Lenape to conform a more familiar sound), but it is doubtful that the city on the Hudson is named for it.
"Houvenkopf".
The mountain's name is from the Dutch "Hooge Kop", meaning "High Head".
"Kill van Kull".
Separating Bayonne and Staten Island. From the Middle Dutch word "kille", meaning "riverbed" or "water channel." Likely evolved from "Achter Col", as in "kille van kol", or "channel from the neck", its spellings including "Kill von Cull", "Kille van Cole", "Kill van Koll"
"Kinderkamack".
This distinctly Dutch sounding name which describes the area along middle reaches of 
Hackensack River, is said to come from the Lenape and mean "place of ceremonial dance and worship" 
"Losen Slote".
A tributary of the Hackensack River, from "losen" and "sloot", or a "dumping trench", essentially an open sewer.
"Mahwah".
"Mawewi" meaning "meeting place" or "place where paths meet" or "assembly"
Contemporary: "mawemin"
"Manhattan".
From "Manna-hata", as written in the 1609 logbook of Robert Juet, an officer on Henry Hudson's yacht "Halve Maen" (Half Moon). A 1610 map depicts the name "Manahata" twice, on both the west and east sides of the Mauritius River (later named the Hudson River). The word "Manhattan" has been translated as "island of many hills" . "The Encyclopedia of New York City" offers other derivations, including from the Munsee dialect of Lenape: "manahachtanienk" ("place of general inebriation"), "manahatouh" ("place where timber is procured for bows and arrows"), or "menatay" ("island").
"Meghgectecock".
This is perhaps an approximation of "masgichteu-cunk" meaning "where May-apples grow", from a moist-woodland perennial that bears edible yellow berries and used to describe the lobe of land between and the confluence of the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers at Newark Bay. It was part of Achter Col for the New Netherlanders and New Barbadoes Neck to the British.
Contemporary: "masgichteu" meaning "may apple" 
"Minkakwa".
On Bergen Neck between Pamrapo and Communipaw at Caven Point. first settled by New Netherlanders in 1647. Spellings include "Minelque" and "Minkacque"
meaning "a place of good crossing" probably because it was the most convenient pass between the two bays on either side of the neck, (or could mean "place where the coves meet"; in this case where they are closet to each and, hence advantageous for portage.)
"Moonachie".
"Ground hog, badger, or place of dug up earth" 
Contemporary:"monachgeu" for "groundhog", and "munhacke" for "badger" and "munhageen" meaning" to dig a hole" 
"Noort Rivier".
Called "Muhheakantuck" or "the river that flowed two ways" in Unami.
The "Noort Rivier" was one of the three main rivers in New Netherland, the others being the "Versche Rivier" or "Fresh River" (likely because of its sweet water) and the "Zuid Rivier" or "South River." In maritme usage, it still defines that part of the Hudson between Hudson County and Manhattan. Another story of its origin has it that the rivers connected to New York Harbor are named the "North" River and "East" River based on what direction of travel they permit.
"Outwater".
Possibly "uiterwaarden" meaning a flood plain, of which there were many, this one at the foot of Paterson Plank Road. More likely from a landowner in the area.
Or 
"Overpeck".
"Oever" meaning "a sloping bank" and "perk" meaning "border or boundary", hence "at the water's edge", actually a riparian zone. Used in English as early as 1665. By the Lenape called "Tantaqua", it was the site of semi-permanent village of the Hackensack.
"Pequannock".
From "Paquettahhnuake" meaning "cleared land ready or being readied for cultivation". "Packanack" is also contemporary variation of this place and the people 
Pacquanacs
"Pamrapo".
On Bergen Neck between Constable Hook and Communipaw. Spellings include "Pimbrepow", "Pembrepock", "Pemmerepoch", "Pimlipo", "Pemrepau", "Pemrapaugh", and "Pamrapough" 
"Paramus".
From "Parampseapus" or "Peremessing" meaning , perhaps, "where there is worthwhile (or fertile) land" or "place of wild turkeys". "Seapus" or "sipus" is said to mean water, so the name may mean "turkey river". Saddle River was also called "Peramseapus". Spellings include "Pyramus".
"Pascack".
"wet grass" or "place where grass is wet"
"Passaic".
The "county, river and "city are taken from "pahsayèk",
"pahsaayeek" and "pasayak", meaning "valley" or "water that flows through the valley." Spellings include: Pawsaick, Pissawack
Contemporary: "Pachsa'jeek"
"Polifly".
From Dutch "pole" and "vlaie", translated as "top of the meadow/atop the swamp"; the name by which the area of Hasbrouck Heights was known. Polifly Road is a major thoroughfare connecting Hackensack and Hasbrouck Heights.
"Pompton".
Has been cited by some sources to mean "a place where they catch soft fish'".
"Paulus Hook".
A tidal island, called "Arresick" by the Lenape the site where, in 1630, Michael Pauw staked a claim for his attempted patroonship, Pavonia. Named after his agent who built a hut and ferry landing there, "hoek" or "hoeck" meaning a "spit" or "point". 
Variations include "Paulus Hoeck, Powles Hoek, Powles Hook"
"Preakness".
From the munsi, "quail woods". Alternatively, thought to mean "young buck", depending on interpretation of the original word.
"Ramapo".
Name for the mountains and river and towns, meaning
"underneath the rock", spellings: "Ramapough", "Ramopock"
"Raritan".
The people, river, bay, and towns take their name from a derivation of "Naraticong" meaning "river beyond the island" (which, considering location, could be Staten Island).
Some would believe that is comes from "Roaton" or "Raritanghe", a tribe which had come from across the Hudson River and displaced the existing population of Sanhicans.
Alternatively, "Raritan" is a Dutch pronunciation of "wawitan" or "rarachons" meaning "forked river" or "stream overflows".
"Sand Hoek".
Sometimes called "Sand Punt" the peninsula around which most settlers to Fort Amsterdam, Fort Orange, Staten Eylandt, and Lange Eylandt, and Bergen sailed before entering The Narrows.
"Schraalenburgh".
Built on a "barren ridge", literally "Barren Hills" Two churches still bear the name: South Schraalenburgh Church and Schraalenburgh North Church
"Secaucus".
"Sukit" meaning "black" and "achgook" meaning "snake", hence "black snakes."
Spellings include "Sekakes", "Sikakes", "Sickakus". Contemporary: "seke" meaning "black" and "xkuk" or "achgook"
meaning "snake". 
Locally, pronounced "SEE-kaw-cus", with the accent on the first syllable, not the second as often used by non-natives.
Snake Hill, in Secaucus, is a geolologic intrusion in the midst of the Meadowlands.
"Sicomac".
Said to mean "resting place for the departed" or "happy hunting ground" since this area of Wyckoff, according to tradition, was the burial place of many Native Americans, possibly including Oratam, sagamore of the Hackensack Indians Contemporary "schikamik" meaning "hole" or "grave" or "machtschikamikunk" meaning "a burial place" 
"Staaten Eylandt".
To the Lenape, the island was known as "Aquehonga", "Manacknong" and "Eghquaons" (Jackson, 1995).
Named by colonlists for the governing body of the 17th century United Provinces of the Netherlands, The States-General.
"Tantaqua".
Overpeck Creek, site of Hackensack semi-permanent village, for one of the chiefs of the resident Lenape 
"Tappan".
The region radiating from Palisades Interstate Park and its inhabitants as named by New Netherlanders, who spelled it as Tappaen. Site of the "bouwerie" Vriessendael.
Possibly from "Tuphanne" meaning "cold water" 
Likely more related to contemporary "petapan" meaning "dawn" or "petapaniui" meaning "at the break of dawn", and relates to their kin across the river, the Wappinger, whose name is derived from the Algonquian "people of the east" or "easterners". (Contemporary: "Wapaneu" meaning "easterly" and "Wapanke" meaning "to-morrow.")
"Teaneck".
Origin and meaning are uncertain, though possibly may mean "the woods" An alternative is from the Dutch "Tiene Neck" meaning "neck where there are willows" (from the Dutch "tene" meaning willow).
"Tenafly".
From Dutch "ten" and "vlaie", hence "Tiene Vly" or "Ten Swamps" given by settlers in 1688.
"Watchung".
The "place of mountains" from "watchtsu", which describes the three ridges west of the Meadowlands.
"Weehawken".
Variously interpreted as or "rocks that look like rows of trees" or "at the end of" (the Palisades or stream that flowed from them.) and "place of gulls".
Spelling have included: "Awiehawken, Wiehacken, Weehauk, Weehawk, Weehock, Wiceaken","Wihaken", "Wyhaken", and "Wiehachan"
Curiously, Peter Minuit, first governor of New Netherland, sailed to the new world upon a ship called the "Seagull", or in Dutch, Het "Meeuwken" (which bears a strking resemblance)
"Weequahic".
"head of the cove".
"Vriessendael".
A small "bowery", or "homestead" established in 1640 at today's Edgewater, meaning "Vries' Valley", after its founder David Pietersen de Vries.
Pre-American Revolution Reformed Congregations in the Dutch Belt.
After the final transfer of power to the English (with the Treaty of Westminster) that settlers to New Netherland and their descendents spread across the region and established many of the towns and cities which exist today. Following the course of the Hudson River in the north via New York Harbor to the Raritan River in the south, settlement and population grew along what George Washington called the "Dutch Belt". The American classis secured a charter in 1766 for Queens College (now Rutgers University), where the appointment in 1784 of John Henry Livingston as professor of theology marked the beginning of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary.

WOVA-LD

WOVA-LD is the low-powered, Fox-affiliated television station for the Mid-Ohio Valley that is licensed to Parkersburg, West Virginia. It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 22 from a transmitter in Independence Township, Ohio. Owned by Gray Television, WOVA is sister to NBC affiliate WTAP-TV and low-powered CBS affiliate WIYE-LD. All three television outlets share studios on Market Street (official address is One Television Plaza) in downtown Parkersburg. Syndicated programming on the station includes "Family Guy", "Judge Judy", "", and "The People's Court" among others. Overnights, it airs paid programming from Jewelry Television.
History.
The market's first ever locally-based Fox affiliate was originally seen on a second digital subchannel of WTAP. Prior to that launch, the Parkersburg/Marietta market did not have a Fox affiliate of its own. Programming from the network was provided through cable from WVAH-TV in Charleston. On April 10, 2006, WTAP launched its Fox-affiliated second digital subchannel to serve as the area's first outlet for the network. To make the new service possible, the big three affiliate underwent a technical transformation. It carved out a new digital, high definition-ready master control room from space previously used for storage. WTAP also installed an entirely digital production room. Despite the market gaining its own Fox affiliate, WVAH continues to be offered on area cable systems.
WOVA was born out of then-license holder Wood Investments LLC's sale of two low-power station licenses on channel 22 (previously holding the callsign WVEX-LP) and another station on UHF channel 47 (then using the callsign WWVX-LP) to Gray Television on April 10, 2012 for $66,000. Gray filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to change the callsign of WVEX-LP to WOVA-LP on July 18, 2012, and changed its city of license to Marietta to Parkersburg. On September 3, 2012, Fox programming moved to this new low-powered station after which WTAP-DT2 was shut down. The move allowed Fox programming to be broadcast over-the-air in high definition. On October 1, 2012, the station changed its call sign to WOVA-LD.
Newscast.
The station offers a weeknight prime time news broadcast known as "Fox Parkersburg News at 10". Airing for thirty minutes from a secondary set, the show mirrors local news seen on WTAP except for slightly different graphics and unique feature segments.

Canopy (grape)

In viticulture, the canopy of a grapevine includes the parts of the vine visible aboveground - the trunk, cordon, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit. The canopy plays a key role in light energy capture via photosynthesis, water use as regulated by transpiration, and microclimate of ripening grapes. Canopy management is an important aspect of viticulture due to its effect on grape yields, quality, vigor, and the prevention of grape diseases. Various viticulture problems, such as uneven grape ripening, sunburn, and frost damage, can be addressed by skillful canopy management. In addition to pruning and leaf trim, the canopy is often trained on trellis systems to guide its growth and assist in access for ongoing management and harvest.
Vine.
The vine is the main part of the grapevine, extending from the root system in the ground up to the cordons, or arms, of the vine. When the grape is young the trunk is very pliable and must be supported by stakes as part of a vine training system. The height of the trunk varies depending on grape variety and the type of trellis system being used and can range from 4 inches (10 cm) to 30 feet (10 m). During winter dormancy, the trunk can be vulnerable to extreme freezing conditions and will be sometimes buried and insulated with soil to protect it. 
The trunk is composed of sleeves of conductive tissue-most notably the phloem and xylem. The outside bark of the vine contains the phloem tissues which transports sap, enriched by sugars and other molecules, from the leaves to the rest of the vine. During the annual growth cycle of the grapevine, the vine will start to store carbohydrate energy in the wood part of the trunk and roots. The downward passage of phloem sap to the roots and this storing process can be interrupted by the viticultural practice of "girdling" or cincturing the vine. This process can improve fruit set by forcing the vine to direct most of its energy towards developing the grape clusters. The xylem is the woody tissue on the inside of the trunk that moves sap, enriched with water, minerals and other compounds, up from the roots to the leaves.
Cordon.
The cordon, or "arms", of the grapevine extend from the trunk and are the part where additional arms and eventually leaves and grape clusters extend. The cordons are usually trained along wires as part of a trellis system. This training usually fixes the cordon into a permanent position, such as horizontal extending from the trunk in opposite directions.
Stem.
The terms stem, stalks and shoots are sometimes used interchangeably but viticulturalists generally make some differentiation. The stem of the grapevine item, extending from cordon, is considered the shoot and this part is most often pruned in the process of "shoot thinning" to control grape yields. The stalk extending out to hold the grape cluster is known as the bunchstem while the stem of the individual grape berry is the pedicel.
The shoot of the vine develops from new buds located on the cordon and grow to include the leaves, tendrils and eventually grape clusters. Shoots first begin to the appear in spring, following bud break, accelerating growth till the flowering stage and usually slowly by the time that the vine begins veraison. During the stage of veraison (typically mid to late summer), the shoot starts to harden and change color from green to brown. The shoot is ripening at this point and becomes known as a "cane". In wintertime, the canes of the grapevine are usually completely cut off with the amount and weight of the cane being used to gauge the amount of pruning and canopy management that will be needed for the upcoming year. The "tip" of the shoot is the small (0.4 in/1 cm) part of the shoot furthermost from the vine. Viticulturalist use the growth of this tip as an indication of vine vigor due to the fact that the tip competes with the grape clusters for resources from the vine. Ideally, shoot growth should come to a stop around the time of veraison; a vine that continues growing the shoots will stand the chance of less fully developed grape clusters.
Leaves.
A grapevine's leaves are the most visible part of the canopy and also one of the most important. It is through the leaves that the vital physiological process of photosynthesis takes places which creates the carbohydrates that the vine needs to grow and process grape clusters. The size of the leaves vary due to grape varieties with varieties like Merlot having very large leaves and Gewürztraminer noted for having small leaves. The typical size is normally comparable to that of a human hand. In addition to size, there are many of other unique characteristics to the leaves that ampelographers use for plant identification. The size and shape of the leaf's sinus (the opening space where the blade of the leaf connects to the petiole, the shape of the "teeth" along the outer edge, the arrangement of the five lobes or projecting parts and the angle and length of the veins can all assist in identifying the grapevine.
The color of the leaf can be an indication of the health and nutrition of the vine. Chlorophyll in the leaf gives it a natural greenish color. Prior to the winter dormancy, the vine will stop being photosynthetically active which will contribute to a natural break down of chlorophyll and changing of color. However, deficiency in nitrogen or sulfur could cause the vine to turn prematurely (such as before harvest) yellow. The appearance of reddish spots of brown "dead zones" could be the sign of a viral infection (such as the leafroll virus) or contamination through the use of herbicides.
Viticulturalist will use a leaf to fruit ratio as a guideline in determining a vine's ability to fully ripen grapes. Quite different from the consideration of yields, the balance of leaf cover (needed for photosynthesis) and proportion of fruit (judged by weight rather than number of clusters) could have the most substantial effect on the quality of the grape for winemaking. Pioneered by viticulturalist Richard Smart, the idea of maintaining a "balanced vine" is to have just enough leaf cover for the plant to produce the energy needed to ripen the grape without having too much photosynthetic activity to where the vines has a surplus of energy and continues growing more shoots. Additionally, leaves provide shade to the grape clusters which be beneficial in protecting the clusters from the harshness of heat stress ("sunburn") but excessive shade can also decrease the development of sugars, anthocyanins and other phenolics and other important compounds in the grape. Many vineyards employ the practice of leaf removal throughout the growing season to try to maintain optimal leaf coverage.

Bob Moha

Bob Moha (1890–1959) (birth name Robert Mucha) was a Milwaukee-based middleweight boxer, nicknamed the "Milwaukee Caveman".
Career.
His decisive defeat of Billy Papke (then considered the lead contender for the middleweight title vacant in the wake of Stanley Ketchel's murder) at a bout in Boston on October 31, 1910, caused Papke to retire briefly from the ring. 
On December 4, 1914, in a fight against Mike Gibbons of St. Paul, Minnesota held in Hudson, Wisconsin, Moha was disqualified in the second round for a blow below the belt. The sponsoring club denied him a share of the purse, since the fight did not go to a decision, and Moha sued them. The case eventually went to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which, in a 1916 ruling, agreed with the original jury that he had failed to fulfill his contractual obligation. Moha was not permitted to introduce testimony that it was customary in such cases for the fouling fighter to receive his contractual share.

Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatiana

Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatiana (), also translated as Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatjana, is a 1994 Finnish/German film directed, produced and co-written by Aki Kaurismäki. The film tells the story of two shy and unaccomplished middle-aged men who run away from their mothers' homes and drive aimlessly on the back roads of Finland.
Plot.
Valto (Mato Valtonen) is a meek middle-aged man who lives with his mother and does tailoring for her clothes business at their home. An ex-rock musician who still dreams of being a rock star, Valto has no other aspirations in life except his great love of coffee. When his mother runs out of coffee and refuses to go out and buy more, Valto becomes infuriated and locks her in a cupboard. He steals her money, leaves the house and meets up with his like-minded friend Reino (Matti Pellonpää), another middle aged ex-rock musician. Reino's only passion is drinking vodka and, as he and Valto get into Valto's car and drive away, Reino is drinking vodka straight from the bottle as Valto drinks coffee he made in a coffee maker that he had installed in his car.
The two don't speak much until they are stopped by two hitchhikers: the thin Tatiana (Kati Outinen) from Estonia and the fat Klavdia (Kirsi Tykkyläinen) from Kazakhstan. The four of them spend the next few days travelling together without much conversation. Even though the two women are outgoing and would like to get to know the two men, Valto and Reino are too shy to communicate with them and instead ignore them as they keep drinking their coffee and vodka.

2008 Agartala bombings

In the 2008 Agartala bombings at least 4 people were killed and a 100 injured on 1 October 2008 in a series of 5 blasts set off in Agartala, capital of the Indian state of Tripura, within 45 minutes, while two unexploded bombs were defused.
This is the fourth series of blasts in India within a week, the other three being the 27 September Delhi bombing, and the Malegoan and Modasa bombings.
Attack.
The blasts went off at Agartala's main shopping area Maharaja Ganju Bazar, Gobind Ballah Pant market, a busy Radhanagar bus stand, Agartala Motorstand, Bottala and Abhay Nagar localities. The first blast happened at Gul Bazar around 7:30 pm (IST), followed by two more at Radha Nagar Bus stand and G B Bazar, around 7:35 and 8:15 respectively. The fourth at Palace Compound. An unidentified man was killed in the blast at Radhanagar bus stand while another person succumbed to injuries. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses said two persons riding a motorcycle were seen moving suspiciously at Radhanagar bus stand and the blast took place about three minutes after they left the area.
The wounded were rushed to G.B. Pant Medical College and Hospital. Tripura police spokesman Nepal Das said that two were high-density blasts, the third a low-density one. Though SP of West Agartala KV Sreejesh contradicted Das about the intensity of blasts, “All bombs were of low intensity. It was meant to create panic before the Durga puja celebrations.”
Follow-up.
On 5 October another live bomb was found and defused in a temple in Agartala. Police officials said the powerful bomb, prepared with ammonium nitrate and other explosive materials and connected to a cell-phone, was found placed in a small tin in a Manipuri temple at the Radhanagar area. The bomb was found on Mahasasthi, the first of the five-day Durga puja festival.
Investigation.
The police suspect the involvement of Bangladesh-based terror group Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami (HuJI), a group which has been frequently blamed for attacks in Uttar Pradesh and Hyderabad. HuJI which has been using Tripura as a transit route lately, as the state shares a porous 856-km border with the neighbouring country. Three suspected HuJI members were arrested in Agartala in the last two months. Tripura has long been a conduit for smuggling and terror merchandise, most violence in the state had been related to insurgencies of tribal groups.
Tripura's two main insurgent groups, the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All-Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF) have not had a history of carrying out bomb attacks on civilians. However, a possible link between the two outfits and Bangladeshi Islamist groups like Huji had not been ruled out by security agencies. Tripura's long border with Bangladesh, as well as the presence of senior leaders of both NLFT and ATTF in Bangladesh have increased the likelihood of logistical support to Huji.
Experts from the National Security Guards (NSG) began an investigation seeking to find the nature of explosives used. The team of NSG experts, led by Major Karam Bir from New Delhi, and a team of experts from the National Forensic Laboratory in Kolkata are investigating along with Tripura police officials.
DIG (Police Control), Nepal Das said six persons have been arrested in connection to the attacks. Four persons, including one of those seen on a bike at the Radhanagar bus stand shortly before the blast there, were arrested on the same night of the explosions. And additional two others were arrested later.
Conspiracy.
"Times Now" (the television arm of the "Times of India") quoted "highly placed intelligence officials" from the Research and Analysis Wing who claimed to have made a technical intercept of a communication between operatives of Bangladesh's intelligence agencies and the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan. The sources said the intercept indicated ISI wanted its Bangladeshi counterpart to activate its operatives in Northeast India. Based on this, security agencies operating in the Northeast, like the Border Security Forces, the Shastra Seema Bal and provincial governments in the region were put on alert by the central intelligence agencies. The media outlet speculated that it wanted DGFI to specifically target Northeastern states to give terror a pan-India outlook and not allow the country's internal security establishment a chance to come to grip with the situation.
Reactions.
A spokesman from the PMO said the PM Singh had spoken to the Chief Minister who had apprised Singh about the incident in his state. Singh, via the spokesman, also condemned the attacks on innocent people and expressed his sorrow over the incident.
The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist)'s general secretary Prakash Karat said "The central government should extend all help to the state government in tracking down the culprits behind this attack especially in view of the fact that the state has international borders on its three sides." He also noted that the Left Front government in Tripura has registered significant success in tackling the extremist groups who used to resort to terrorist violence in the insurgency-racked state. He claimed that the explosions must be seen as an attempt to destabilise the situation. He also said he had spoken to Chief Minister Manik Sarkar to be updated on the situation.

Church of Holy Trinity, Minories

Holy Trinity, Minories, was an Anglican parish church outside the eastern boundaries of the City of London; but within the Liberties of the Tower of London. The liberty was incorporated in the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney in 1899, and today is within the City of London. Converted from the chapel of a nunnery, Holy Trinity was in use from the 16th century until the end of the 19th century.
History.
The district lay within the precincts of the Monastery of St Clare, founded by Edmund Crouchback, in 1293, for a group of Spanish nuns of the Order of St. Clare who arrived with his wife. The nuns were also known as the "Minoresses" – which came to be adapted as the name for the district, Minories. The nunnery was surrendered to the Crown in 1539, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and the buildings, excluding the chapel, were used as an armory for the Tower of London, and later, as a workhouse. Some of the abbey buildings survived until their destruction by fire in 1797.
The nuns' chapel became a parish church. Considerable changes were made to the building: all the ancient monuments were removed, a gallery, a new pulpit and pews were installed, and a steeple was built. The first recorded reference to a dedication to the Holy Trinity dates from 1563. Later in the 16th century, the church was a Puritan stronghold, where both John Field and Thomas Wilcox preached. Until 1730, the church claimed the rights of a royal peculiar – including freedom from the authority of the Bishop of London; and the right to perform marriages "without licence".
The church escaped the Great Fire of London but fell into disrepair and was rebuilt in brick in 1706, retaining the north wall of the medieval building. The new church was a plain structure, a single space undivided by pillars or columns, long and wide, built at a cost of £700. The bells were housed in a wooden turret above the projecting porch.
Closure and destruction.
In 1899, the church was closed under the provisions of the Union of Benefices Act 1860 and united with the parish of St Botolph's Aldgate. The former church was used as a parish room until destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The medieval north wall wall survived until the clearance of the site in 1956–8.

Vertex enumeration problem

In mathematics, the vertex enumeration problem for a polytope, a polyhedral cell complex, a hyperplane arrangement, or some other object of discrete geometry, is the problem of determination of the object's vertices given some formal representation of the object. A classical example is the problem of enumeration of the vertices of a convex polytope specified by a set of linear inequalities:
where "A" is an "m"×"n" matrix, "x" is an "n"×1 column vector of variables, and "b" is an "m"×1 column vector of constants.
Computational complexity.
The computational complexity of the problem is a subject of research in computer science.
A 1992 article by David Avis and Komei Fukuda presents an algorithm which finds the "v" vertices of a polytope defined by a nondegenerate system of "n" inequalities in "d" dimensions (or, dually, the "v" facets of the convex hull of "n" points in "d" dimensions, where each facet contains exactly "d" given points) in time O("ndv") and space O("nd"). The "v" vertices in a simple arrangement of "n" hyperplanes in "d" dimensions can be found in O("n"2"dv") time and O("nd") space complexity. The Avis–Fukuda algorithm adapted the criss-cross algorithm for oriented matroids.

<doc id="19558329" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19558329" title="Jim Allen (playwright)">
Jim Allen (playwright)

James "Jim" Allen (7 October 1926 – 24 June 1999) was a socialist playwright from England, best known for his collaborations with Ken Loach.
Early life.
Allen was born in the Miles Platting area of Manchester on 7 October 1926, the second child of Kitty and Jack Allen, Roman Catholics of Irish descent. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Allen left school at the age of 13 to work in a wire factory. He had various jobs during the war, before being called up into the Army in 1944. He joined the Seaforth Highlanders, and served with the British occupation forces in Germany. After leaving the army in 1947, he worked at a variety of jobs, including a builder's labourer, a fireman in the British Merchant Navy, and a miner at Bradford colliery in Manchester.
Politics.
During his military service, Allen was imprisoned for assault, where a fellow inmate introduced him to the ideals of Socialism. He was a passionate socialist for the rest of his life, although he detested Stalinism and refused to be associated with the Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1958 Allen joined the Socialist Labour League (SLL, the forerunner of the Workers' Revolutionary Party) led by Gerry Healy and John G. M. Lawrence, a small group then pursuing entryist tactics within the Labour Party. The SLL objected to the close association between the CPGB and the National Union of Mineworkers, and Allen was a prominent campaigner for the League, attending rallies at coalmines throughout the UK. In 1962, the Labour Party declared the SLL to be a "proscribed organization", leading to Allen's expulsion from the party. He subsequently resigned his membership of the League, and was not associated with any recognized political party thereafter.
Writing career.
Allen began to write during his time as a miner. In 1958, he was involved in the launch and publication of "The Miner", which actively recruited for the SLL. The proscription of the SLL, together with the closed shop system of the time, made it impossible for him to find work in the mining or building trades, and he decided to adopt writing as a full-time profession. In 1964, he submitted a script to Granada TV, and was taken on as a scriptwriter for the soap opera "Coronation Street" (1965–67), a series for which he had little time. His later play, "The Talking Head" (1969), recounts the experience of a talented writer driven to a nervous breakdown by the pressure of "episode delivery dates".
Allen's first play, "The Hard Word" (1966), directed by Ridley Scott, was broadcast as part of the "Thirty-Minute Theatre" series on BBC 2. It was followed by "The Lump" (1967), the first fictional work directed by Jack Gold, who had begun his career on documentaries, and broadcast as part of "The Wednesday Play" drama anthology series. Both plays were based on his experiences in the building trade, and "The Lump" features an activist worker who frequently quotes Lenin and Jack London, establishing the political nature of Allen's work which was to continue throughout his career.
Allen was introduced to Ken Loach in 1967 by Loach's regular collaborator at the time, producer Tony Garnett, who had produced "The Lump". The first of Allen's plays to be directed by Loach was "The Big Flame" (1969), again for "The Wednesday Play" series. The play depicts a strike among the dockers of Liverpool, led by a Trotskyite docker against the wishes of the established union; the strike is violently broken by the army and police.
In 1975, Allen wrote, Garnett produced, and Loach directed "Days of Hope", Allen's best-known work. A serial of four episodes, it tells the story of the British Labour movement between the end of the Great War in 1918 and the General Strike of 1926. The series' depiction of the British Army was the subject of much hostile criticism in the press at the time.
Allen also wrote five plays ("The Rank and File" (1971), "A Choice of Evils" (1977), "The Spongers" (1978), "United Kingdom" (1981) and "Willie's Last Stand" (1982)) for the BBC's "Play for Today" drama series, and several episodes of the Granada series "Crown Court" (1975–76).
Allen and Loach's most controversial production was Allen's stage play, "Perdition". Presented as a courtroom drama, the play dealt with an allegation of collaboration between Hungarian Zionists and the Nazis during the Holocaust. The play was due to open at the Royal Court Theatre in January 1987, but was cancelled 36 hours before the opening night; the script was read in public at that year's Edinburgh Festival. Lord Goodman wrote in the "Evening Standard" on 23 January 1987: "Mr Jim Allen's description of the Holocaust can claim a high place in the table of classic anti-Semitism." The work was not produced as a stage play until 1999.
With Loach as director, Allen wrote the screenplays for three feature-length films: "Hidden Agenda" (1990), which portrays the murder of an American civil rights activist in Belfast, "Raining Stones" (1993), a kitchen-sink tragicomedy set in Middleton, Greater Manchester, and, Allen's final dramatic work, "Land and Freedom" (1995), telling the story of an idealistic young Communist from Liverpool who joins the Government forces in the Spanish Civil War.
Death.
Allen was diagnosed with cancer in February 1999, and died the following June.

A Season in Purgatory

A Season in Purgatory is a 1993 novel by Dominick Dunne. It was inspired by the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley, for which Michael Skakel, the nephew of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, eventually was convicted. Dunne became fascinated with the story after covering the 1991 rape trial of William Kennedy Smith for "Vanity Fair".
The hardcover edition (ISBN 0-517-58386-0) was released by Crown Publishers on April 13, 1993. The paperback (ISBN 0-553-29076-2) was published by Bantam Books on June 1, 1994.
Plot synopsis.
The novel's protagonist and narrator is Harrison Burns, who received an Ivy League education thanks to the generosity of Gerald Bradley, the patriarch of a large, wealthy, and politically well-connected Irish Catholic family who has links to organized crime. Twenty years after Connecticut teenager and Bradley neighbor Winifred Utley is bludgeoned to death with a softball bat, her murder remains unsolved, and Burns, now a successful true crime writer who is haunted by the secret he has kept for the past two decades, steps forward to accuse Gerald's son Constant, who is being groomed to be President of the United States, of the crime. What ensues is a widespread investigation that threatens to tear apart one of the most powerful families in the state, unless they manage to destroy Burns first.
Critical reception.
In the "New York Times", Maureen Dowd observed, "In his latest cafe-society roman a clef . . . Dominick Dunne takes all the most chilling character flaws of three generations of Kennedys and compresses them into one creepy plot line. If you can bear to read one more word, even with a gossamer veneer of fiction, about America's royal and sorrowful Irish Catholic clan, and if you like Mr. Dunne's dishy style of society vivisection, then you will probably enjoy his new tour of the toxic side of a golden American family." 
Gene Lyons of "Entertainment Weekly" thought, "What ought to have been the gripping courtroom drama hinted at in the novel's opening pages becomes a murky progression of botched assassinations, fortuitous heart attacks and strokes, and a homicide trial filled with more legal absurdities than a half-dozen episodes of "Night Court". After so promising a start, it's a letdown." Despite his disappointment, he graded it "a solid B." 
A critical analysis of themes in Dunne's fiction, "The Inconvenient Women: Feminine Consciousness and the American Gentry in the Popular Novels of Dominick Dunne" 
by Robert von Dassanowsky posits that Evelyn Waugh's "Brideshead Revisited" strongly influenced the structure and characters of "A Season in Purgatory."
Television adaptation.
Robert W. Lenski adapted the novel for a May 1996 CBS miniseries directed by David Greene. The cast included Patrick Dempsey as Harrison Burns, Craig Sheffer as Constant Bradley, and Brian Dennehy as Gerald Bradley, with Sherilyn Fenn, Edward Herrmann, David Marshall Grant, Bonnie Bedelia, and Blair Brown in supporting roles.

Sorbetes

Sorbetes is the traditional variation of ice cream made in the Philippines. It is distinct from the similarly named sorbet. Peddled by street hawkers, it is usually served with small wafer or sugar cones and more recently, bread buns. It is uniquely made from coconut milk, unlike other iced desserts that are made from animal milk.
History and formulation.
Ice cream was introduced in the Philippines during the American Occupation when refrigerators and other cooling devices were introduced. While American ice cream was made with cow's milk, using the milk of the carabao, a kind of water buffalo, resulted in a cheaper product which became known as "sorbetes." Both kinds of milk are widely used today. Coconut milk and cassava flour are two other ingredients used that make sorbetes unique from ice cream made in other countries. Flavors also varied from the usual natural fruits such as mango, avocado, melon, jackfruit, coconut and strawberry to flavors imitating commercial ice cream such as chocolate, cookies and cream, cheese, mocha, ube, etc.
The sorbetes industry competes with commercially available ice cream from giant companies operating in the Philippines such as Arce Dairy, Magnolia, Nestlé, and Selecta, which also started peddling their product in the streets in more sanitized carts.
Peddling.
Sorbetes is peddled by sorbeteros using colorfully painted wooden carts which usually can accommodate three flavors, each in a large metal canister. Peddlers get their carts from makers scattered around the cities of the Philippines in the morning and walk the streets the whole day, calling consumers from their houses by ringing a small handheld bell.
The wooden cart has two large wooden wheels at the front part to easily push the cart though latest carts are already attached to bicycles.
The cart is stuffed with shaved ice sprinkled with salt to produce a lower temperature around the metal canisters and keep the sorbetes frozen longer.
The whole sorbetes cart is also available for private gatherings when negotiated with the sorbetero. It is usually cheaper than buying gallons of ice cream to be served to guests.
Serving.
Peddlers of sorbetes provide several serving options. It may be served in a small plastic cup, a wafer cone, a sugar cone or a bread bun, at varying prices. A serving can include one flavor or, for no extra charge, a mixture of available flavors.
Sorbetes is usually consumed as a snack while travelling. It can also be served as dessert.

Marie-Azélie Guérin Martin

Blessed Marie-Azélie "Zélie" Martin née Guérin (23 December 1831 - 28 August 1877) was a French laywoman and the mother of Saint Thérèse de Lisieux. Her husband was Blessed Louis Martin.
Life.
Early life.
Marie-Azélie Guérin was born in Saint-Denis-sur-Sarthon, Orne, France and was the second daughter of Isidore Guérin and Louise-Jeanne Macé. She had an older sister, Marie-Louise, who became a Visitandine nun, and a younger brother, Isidore, who was a pharmacist. Her maternal family were from the Madré, in the neighbouring department of Mayenne, where her grandfather Louis Macé was baptised on the 16th March 1778.
Zélie wanted to become a nun, but was turned away by the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul due to respiratory difficulties and recurrent headaches. Zélie then prayed for God to give her children and that they would be consecrated to God. 
Later, she decided to become a lacemaker, making Point d'Alençon lace. She later fell in love with a watchmaker, Louis Martin, in 1858 and married only three months later.
Marriage and family.
Although Zélie and Louis had led a continent marriage for almost a year, they had decided to have children. They would have nine children, though only five daughters would survive childhood; all became nuns:
After Zélie's death, Pauline, Marie, Thérèse and Céline all became Carmelite nuns one after another along with a cousin, Marie Guérin. Léonie became a Visitandine nun after leaving the Poor Clares.
Death.
Marie-Azélie died of breast cancer on 28 August 1877 in Alençon, Orne, aged 45. She was survived by her husband and daughters.
Beatification.
Louis and Marie-Azélie Martin were declared "venerable" on 26 March 1994 by Pope John Paul II. They were beatified on 19 October 2008 by Jose Cardinal Saraiva Martins, the legate of Pope Benedict XVI in Basilique de Sainte-Thérèse, Lisieux, France. For Louis and Zélie to be canonized, the Church must find that God worked a miracle at their intercession.
On January 7, 2013 Archbishop Carlos Osoro Serra of Valencia, Spain presided at the opening of the canonical process to inquire into the healing of a little girl named Carmen who was born in Valencia only four days before Louis and Zelie were beatified. The process is scheduled to close on May 21, 2013. The file will then be sent to Rome to be examined by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.
Publications.
In 2011 the letters of Blessed Zélie and Louis Martin were published in English as "A Call to a Deeper Love: The Family Correspondence of the Parents of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, 1863-1885," "translated by Ann Connors Hess and edited by Dr. Frances Renda (Staten Island, N.Y.: Alba House."

Woodland Avenue is a stop along the SEPTA Media (Route 101) trolley line. It is officially located on Woodland Avenue (PA 420) & Rolling Road in Springfield, Pennsylvania, though Rolling Road is actually a block north of the tracks. A school and athletic field exists at the end of that intersection.
Trolleys arriving at this station travel between 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Orange Street in Media, Pennsylvania. The station has a shed with a roof on the south side of the tracks where people can go inside when it is raining. Like Providence Road stop in Media, a storage track begins northeast of Woodland Avenue across from the station shed that eventually becomes the second track. Part of the reason for the single track is because the Crum Creek Bridge in Smedley Park only carries one track.

First mass transport to Auschwitz concentration camp

On June 14, 1940, German occupying authorities organized the first mass transport of prisoners to the recently opened Auschwitz Concentration Camp. The transport, which set from southern Polish city of Tarnów, consisted of 728 Poles, including some Jewish Poles. They were political prisoners, usually affiliated with resistance movements and in most cases, they were Catholics, since the mass deportations of Jews had not yet begun. All were sent to Auschwitz by the Sicherheitspolizei — German Security Police. They came to Auschwitz I from the regular prison at Tarnow, where they had been incarcerated as political opponents of the Nazi regime. These inmates were assigned the numbers 31 through 758, with numbers 1 through 30 having been reserved for ordinary German criminals, brought from Sachsenhausen, who had come to Auschwitz on May 20 and who later became kapos.
According to local historian from Tarnów, Aleksandra Pietrzykowa, a day before the transport, on June 13, the 728 prisoners were called from a previously prepared list and ordered to take a shower and to disinfect themselves in a public bath. The procedure lasted all night and early in the morning, whole group, escorted by the SS, marched along deserted Tarnów streets, to the railway station's platform. There, all were pushed to the waiting rail cars.
Eugeniusz Niedojadlo, who was in the group, recalled later: “The day of our departure was hot and sunny. We were walking in fours, guarded by the armed SS. Inhabitants of Tarnów were ordered to stay in their homes, and we had no idea where we were going”.
Niedojadlo stated that the sprawling group looked like a giant snake and it gave him impression of cattle, being led to a slaughterhouse. "The SS were constantly yelling at us, and we were sad and depressed. Even though the streets were empty, here and there I saw curious faces looking at us from behind the curtains. At one moment, some unknown hand tossed a bunch of red flowers towards us, but an SS officer trampled it."
Polish historian Aleksandra Pietrzykowa, who specializes in World War II-related topics in the area of Tarnów claims that initially, 753 persons left the prison on that day. However, only 728 inmates reached the camp. Pietrzykowa tried to find answer to that question, writing: "In prison records, under the date June 13, 1940, a transport of 753 persons was mentioned. However, 25 persons less reached the camp. We have established that one person was released at the rail platform, just before departure of the train. According to testimonies of other inmates — Jan Stojakowski (number 577, arrested on November 2, 1939), E. Geissler and Wladyslaw Pilat (number 330), the remaining 24 might have been prisoners from Stalowa Wola, who reached Auschwitz, but for unknown reasons, all were brought back to Tarnów on the next day. In Tarnów prison records, under the date June 15, 1940, there is a short entry: “Transport Stalowa Wola, 24 persons”. We do not know what happened to these inmates and why they were transported back, if they were transported back at all."
The number 31, which opened the list of political prisoners of Auschwitz I, was given to Stanisław Ryniak, who was the first Pole in Auschwitz Ryniak, who in 1940 was 24 years old, had been arrested by the Nazis in his hometown of Sanok in May 1940 and was accused of being a member of the Polish resistance. On May 7, he was transported to Tarnów prison, together with eighteen other Poles from Jarosław.
The number 758, the last one of the transport, was assigned to Ignacy Plachta from Łódź. Plachta had been caught by the Gestapo in southern town of Zagórz, on February 1, 1940, while trying to escape to Hungary. Prisoner number 349 that day was famed Polish Olympic skier Bronislaw Czech who was captured in his hometown Zakopane, Poland in May.
Upon arrival, the Poles lined up in five rows and were met by Hauptsturmführer Karl Fritzsch, who announced: "This is Auschwitz Concentration Camp... Any resistance or disobedience will be ruthlessly punished. Anyone disobeying superiors, or trying to escape, will be sentenced to death. Young and healthy people don't live longer than three months here. Priests one month, Jews two weeks. There is only one way out — through the crematorium chimneys". The crematorium however did not begin operation till August 15, 1940.
In spite of those dim prospects, Aleksandra Pietrzykowa established that around 200 members of the first transport survived. Eugeniusz Niedojadlo, a political prisoner and survivor, who spent almost five years in Auschwitz, said that members of the first transport kept together all the time. The Tarnow inmates also cooperated with other Polish inmates, from nearby city of Rzeszów.
Today, the square in front of former public bath in Tarnów is called Square of Auschwitz Inmates, and in 1975, a monument commemorating this tragic event was unveiled there. The author of the project of the monument is Tarnów's architect Otto Schier.

Rin Aoki

Life and career.
Gravure Idol.
Aoki was born in Yamagata Prefecture on February 28, 1985. She was first scouted in Harajuku as a gravure model in 2002 at the age of 17. Her first gravure video, "Burst", appeared in 2003 and she soon became a popular Gravure idol. After two years as a glamour model, Aoki decided to enter the adult video scene and signed with the major Japanese AV company S1 No. 1 Style, one of the Hokuto Corporation group of companies. It is reported that her contract guaranteed her an estimated 13,000,000 yen (about $166,000) per movie, a sum greatly above the average even for top AV idols.
AV actress.
Her first AV production with S1, "K-cup Active Idol Risky Mosaic", appeared in May 2006 and was directed by Hideto Aki who also directed most of her subsequent videos with S1. She says she was comfortable with her first AV work but was embarrassed about showing her nipples because they were small and pale colored. After making ten original videos with S1 in almost a year, she left the studio along with Maria Ozawa and other fellow S1 actresses to join the startup company DAS. In contrast to S1 which specializes in the "softer" type of pornography with mostly straightforward boy-girl sex scenes, DAS videos ventured into more extreme areas such as simulated rape, creampie and watersports. Aoki starred in the first video of the DAS series DASD-001, "20 Shots Creampie!", released on April 25, 2007. She has made several more movies for DAS including her first inter-racial role in the DAS "Black Gang Rape" series.
By August 2008, Aoki was with a new start-up studio, OPPAI, which publicized her first video for them, "108 cm Kcup Rin", with a signing and modeling event. Although continuing to make movies for OPPAI, she has also appeared in videos for Attackers and yet another new studio, Ranmaru.
Popularity and recognition.
Aoki is one of the latest examples of the very popular genre of "Big-Bust" models in the Japanese AV industry going back to Kimiko Matsuzaka. As a measure of her popularity in Japan, the listing of the top 100 actresses by sales from the DMM website shows Aoki ranked #3 in 2006 and #9 in 2007.
Aoki had a small preview appearance in the S1 compilation video "Hyper – Barely There Mosaic" (ハイパーギリギリモザイク) with AV idols Sora Aoi, Yua Aida, Yuma Asami, Maria Ozawa and Honoka which won the 2006 AV Open competition among Japanese porn studios.
At the 7th annual Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards for 2006 sponsored by the Japanese tabloid newspaper "Tokyo Sports" (東京スポーツ), Aoki was honored with the Star AV Actress Award (主演AV女優賞).

Semantic data model

A semantic data model in software engineering has various meanings: 
Typically the instance data of semantic data models explicitly include the kinds of relationships between the various data elements, such as <is located in>. To interpret the meaning of the facts from the instances it is required that the meaning of the kinds of relations (relation types) is known. Therefore, semantic data models typically standardise such relation types. This means that the second kind of semantic data models enable that the instances express facts that include their own meaning. 
The second kind of semantic data models are usually meant to create semantic databases. The ability to include meaning in semantic databases facilitates building distributed databases that enable applications to interpret the meaning from the content. This implies that semantic databases can be integrated when they use the same (standard) relation types. This also implies that in general they have a wider applicability than relational or object oriented databases.
Overview.
The logical data structure of a database management system (DBMS), whether hierarchical, network, or relational, cannot totally satisfy the requirements for a conceptual definition of data, because it is limited in scope and biased toward the implementation strategy employed by the DBMS. Therefore, the need to define data from a conceptual view has led to the development of semantic data modeling techniques. That is, techniques to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data. As illustrated in the figure. The real world, in terms of resources, ideas, events, etc., are symbolically defined within physical data stores. A semantic data model is an abstraction which defines how the stored symbols relate to the real world. Thus, the model must be a true representation of the real world.
According to Klas and Schrefl (1995), the "overall goal of semantic data models is to capture more meaning of data by integrating relational concepts with more powerful abstraction concepts known from the Artificial Intelligence field. The idea is to provide high level modeling primitives as integral part of a data model in order to facilitate the representation of real world situations".
History.
The need for semantic data models was first recognized by the U.S. Air Force in the mid-1970s as a result of the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) Program. The objective of this program was to increase manufacturing productivity through the systematic application of computer technology. The ICAM Program identified a need for better analysis and communication techniques for people involved in improving manufacturing productivity. As a result, the ICAM Program developed a series of techniques known as the IDEF (ICAM Definition) Methods which included the following:
During the 1990s the application of semantic modelling techniques resulted in the semantic data models of the second kind. An example of such is the semantic data model that is standardised as ISO 15926-2 (2002), which is further developed into the semantic modelling language Gellish (2005). The definition of the Gellish language is documented in the form of a semantic data model. Gellish itself is a semantic modelling language, that can be used to create other semantic models. Those semantic models can be stored in Gellish Databases, being semantic databases.
Applications.
A semantic data model can be used to serve many purposes. Some key objectives include:

Sir Samuel Crompton, 1st Baronet

Sir Samuel Crompton, 1st Baronet (c. 1786 – 27 December 1849) was a politician in the United Kingdom. He served as a Member for Parliament for East Retford, Derby and Thirsk. He also served as Deputy Lieutenant for the North Riding of Yorkshire.
Biography.
Crompton was the son of Samuel and Sarah. His father had been the mayor of Derby in 1782 and 1788. His mother was the daughter of Samuel Fox of Derby. The Crompton family was said to be descended from a Reverend John Crompton who settled in Derbyshire at the time of Charles I. Genealogies of the period refer to the family as the Cromptons of Milford House.
Crompton sat as a Member of Parliament for East Retford in 1818 and served as that member of parliament until that constituency was removed due to the Reform Act. He married Isabella Sophia Hamilton sixth daughter of the Honourable and Rev Archibald Hamilton Cathcart (a son of the ninth Lord Cathcart) and niece to the first Earl Cathcart on 3 November 1829.
In the following year he was elected for Derby which he held until 1834 when he was elected for Thirsk. He supported the premiership of Lord Melbourne but we was not a radical liberal. Such Liberal measures as shortening parliaments or adopting voting by ballot did not enjoy his support. Crompton was created a baronet, of Wood End, Yorkshire, on 21 July 1838. He retired as member for Thirsk in 1841 when he returned to his residence there called "Wood End".
Crompton served as Deputy Lieutenant for the North Riding of Yorkshire from 1808 and he died aged 63 at the family home. He was survived by his wife and his four daughters: Elizabeth Mary born 5 June 1831, Isabel Sarah born 7 May 1833, Fanny Selina 6 February 1835 and Alice 6 March 1837. However, he died without sons so the baronetcy became extinct.

1997 Winchester 400

The twenty-eighth annual Roger Holdeman Memorial Winchester 400 motor race (run yearly since 1970) was held under All-Pro Series sanction on September 28, 1997, at the Winchester Speedway, Indiana (USA).
Making only his second appearance at the famed Winchester Speedway, Hank Parker, Jr. led the final 54 laps to capture the 28th annual Winchester 400. Parker, Jr. of Denver, North Carolina, passed Wayne Anderson on the 348th circuit and bagged $13,975 for the victory.
The race.
Setting the pace in qualifying with a lap of 15.802 seconds (113.910 MPH), Nipper Alsup jumped into the green at the start with Parker, Jr., Derrick Gilchrist, Mike Harmon, and defending "400" Champion Scot Walters all giving chase. On lap 17, trouble at the back of the field became a problem for the race leader. Ken Alexander and Tony Ridner made contact and spun directly in front of the leaders. Forced to stop on the racetrack to avoid contact, Alsup was relegated to 20th position in the field. That handed the lead to Gilchrist for 16 laps until Parker, Jr. went out from for the first time on lap 34. Parker, Jr. would remain in front until stopping for tires on lap 114 which handed the lead over to Anderson, who held it until he stopped on lap 179 and the lead cycled back to Parker, Jr. Trying to work his way back to the front, Alsup’s day would end when he hit the fourth turn wall on lap 69.
The seventh caution period waved when Steven Christian hammered the third turn wall. Under the yellow, all the lead lap cars dove onto pit road for service. Anderson’s crew won the race off pit road and he paced the field as it went back to green on lap 298. Just as things looked to be going in his favor, Anderson suddenly slowed on lap 347 as he ran out of fuel. His misfortune handed the lead back to Parker, Jr. who held off a hard-charging Jeff Fultz by 0.77 seconds. Mike Harmon finished third with Ron Young and rookie Carl Long rounding out the top-five finishers.

Hemigalinae

Hemigalinae is a subfamily of the viverrids that was denominated and first described by John Edward Gray in 1864. This subfamily comprises the four monospecific genera: 
Characteristics.
The tail of Hemigalinae species is ringed. The toes and the middle of the lower part of the tarsus are bald. The frenum, upper part and sides of the lower part are hairy. The orbit is imperfect.
Hemigalinae resemble the Viverrinae in having the scent glands present in both sexes and wholly perineal, but differing by their simpler structure, consisting in the male of a shallower, 
smaller pouch, with less tumid lips, situated mid-way between the scrotum and the penis, but not extending to either. In the female, the scent glands consist of a pair of swellings, each with a slit-like orifice, situated one on each side of the vagina and a little behind it and on a common eminence, the perineal area behind this eminence being naked. The prepuce is long and pendulous. The feet are nearly intermediate in structure between those of the digitigrade Viverrinae and the semiplantigrade Paradoxurinae, but more like the latter, both the carpal and metatarsal pads being well developed, double, and joining the plantar pad below, and as wide as it is at the point of contact. But the feet, with the pads, are considerably narrower, the carpals and metatarsals converging and meeting above so that a much larger area of the under surface is hairy. The area between the four main digits and the plantar pad is covered with short hair, and the pads of the third and fourth digits of the hind foot are separated as in the Viverrinae, not confluent as in the Paradoxurinae. The retractile claws are not protected by skin-lobes.

La Ville dont le prince est un enfant (play)

La Ville dont le prince est un enfant is a 1955 play by French dramatist Henry de Montherlant. The title, literally translated, "The City Whose Prince is a Child", is taken from Ecclesiastes 10:16: ""Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!"
Progress of the theatrical work.
Henri de Montherland was born 20 April 1895 and one of his first works was started in 1912 under the title "Serge Sandrier", and continued to be transformed for four decades before being published in 1951 and the definitive version in 1967. It was inspired by the adolescent years of Montherlant, particularly his formative years in "Institution Notre-Dame de Sainte-Croix" commonly known as "Collège Sainte-Croix de Neuilly" in 1912. It looks at the difficulties in the life of André Sevrais as a young man 15–16 years of age in a Catholic school in France, his friendship and love for a younger boy aged 11–12 years.
An amended version would be republished in 1969, before Montherlant's death on 21 September 1972 under the title "Les Garçons" (literally "The Boys"), that takes a fresh look on the story with André Sevrait becoming the character Alban de Bricoule, who already served as a double in Montherlant works "Le Songe et Les Bestiaires".
Plot.
Philosophy student André Sevrais attends a Catholic boys' school in Paris, where he becomes fast friends with his younger schoolmate, a little rebellious boy named Serge Souplier. This friendship between the two youngsters does not go unobserved by the Abbot of Pradts, who harbors a secret obsession with Souplier and uses his position of authority to try to handle the adolescent Servais, with the pretext of protecting the youngster Souplier; ultimately, however, he is undone by his own hand.
French film adaptation.
Christophe Malavoy directed in 1997 a film entitled La Ville dont le prince est un enfant, also known by its English language release title The Fire That Burns. In the movie version Malavoy played the role of Abbot of Pradts and Naël Marandin the role of André Sevrais and Clément van den Bergh in the role of Serge Souplier. The film also featured Michel Aumont the role as superior of the school.
English play adaptations.
The play was first translated for broadcasting as "The Land where a Child is King" by Henry Reed and broadcast by the B.B.C. in 1962 and later translated as"The Fire that Consumes" by Vivian Cox with Bernard Miles, and staged at the at the Mermaid Theatre in 1977.
Issues.
The play deals with the complex relations in a Catholic school. The abbot is torn between his human desires and his religious obligations of abstinence. He tells the superior of the college that God has created men more sensitive than the fathers, as they see how these children who are not ours are not loved. He also tells André Sevrais who refuses this fate: "You will smile about this when you are twenty years old"; to which the boy answers: "Not me, I will never smile!". Indeed, Montherlant would be haunted throughout his life with this experience at a young age in 1912 at Collège Sainte-Croix de Neuilly in 1912.
However Montherlant would take huge precautions to approach the touchy troubled topic of the taboo subject of friendship between children and adults, especially in a Catholic environment genuinely fearing not to write a text which would devalue the religion as he carefully explained in the long foreword to the play and the appendx published with the part.

Hydrotech.
In 1993, Perry founded Hydrotech Mechanical Services, Inc., a mechanical contracting firm in Dillsburg, which continues to operate today. The firm provides contract construction and maintenance services to municipal and investor-owned utilities from North Carolina to New York specializing in large meter calibration. In 2002, charges were raised against Hydrotech due to a regulator pursuing an estimating error on an internal form completed by an employee of the company. Perry faced charges of conspiring to falsify state mandated sewage records. Upon review of the situation and circumstances he was allowed to complete a diversion program and avoid any charges that allowed him to keep his U.S security clearance. 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
Elections.
In 2006, State Representative Bruce Smith of Pennsylvania's 92nd House District decided to retire. He won the Republican primary with 41% of the vote. He won the general election with 71% of the vote. In 2008, He won re-election to a second term unopposed. In 2010, he won re-election to a third term unopposed.
Tenure.
During his first session he become the prime sponsor of 12 bills and co-sponsoring others. Included in his legislative agenda were issues such as calling for a constitutional convention and holding the line against excessive spending. In the 2009-10 session, Perry served as prime sponsor of 17 bills, most notably House Bill 40, now known as the Castle Doctrine, which allows Pennsylvania residents to defend themselves in the face of imminent violent attack, without having to retreat in the face of a criminal. This legislation was enacted on June 28, 2011, when Gov. Tom Corbett signed the bill into law. In the 2010-11 session, Perry prime sponsored bills aimed to reduce the size of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, restrict the growth of spending in the state budget, protect taxpayers who pay their taxes in an escrow account, eliminate the Inheritance (death) tax, and authorize a Legislative Budget Finance Committee study of performance-based budgeting in Pennsylvania. He also co-sponsored bills that, mandate photo identification for welfare cash assistance cards, known as “EBT”, mandating Social Security number verification for state benefits, requiring photo ID verification of employees by employers, and increasing prize limits for gambling at private and social clubs.

The Mitsubishi Type 92 Reconnaissance Aircraft (九二式偵察機) (company designation 2MR8) was a Japanese short-range reconnaissance aircraft of the 1930s designed by Mitsubishi for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. A total of 230 were built, serving between 1933 and 1936. A parasol monoplane, the Type 92 was the first military aircraft powered by an engine both designed and manufactured in Japan to enter service.
Development and design.
In 1930, Mitsubishi developed two designs to meet a Japanese Army requirement for a short-range reconnaissance aircraft to supplement the larger, long-range Kawasaki Type 88, the 2MR7, a biplane based on its earlier 2MR reconnaissance aircraft and B2M torpedo bomber developed for the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the 2MR8, a high-wing parasol monoplane.
The first of four prototypes flew on 28 March 1931, powered by a 239 kW (320 hp) Mitsubishi A2 radial engine. Successive prototypes were modified with more powerful engines, reduced wing area and a shorter fuselage until the fourth prototype was accepted by the Japanese Army, and ordered into service as the Type 92 Reconnaissance Aircraft. 
The production Type 92 had fixed wide-track divided landing gear, and was powered by a 354 kW (450 hp) Mitsubishi Type 92 radial engine. It carried a crew of two in open cockpits, with an armament of two synchronised, forward-firing 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns and one or two flexibly-mounted guns on the observer's cockpit. Production completed in 1934 after a total of 230 aircraft were built. 
To meet the requirements of the Japanese Ministry of Railways for a survey aircraft, Mitsubishi developed a civilian version of the Type 92, the Hato survey aircraft. A single aircraft was ordered in 1935, together with a Fokker Super Universal built by Nakajima. Powered by a 298 kW (400 hp) Mitsubishi A5 engine, it differed from the military version in having a glazed canopy over the rear cockpit (which accommodated a crew of two), an open forward pilot's cockpit, and spat-type main wheel fairings. It was delivered in March 1936 and registered "J-AARA".
Operational history.
The Type 92 saw active service in Manchuria with the air battalions (later expanded to air wings) of the Kwantung Army Air Corps between 1933 and 1936. The Mitsubishi Type 92 was also used by the Chinese Air Force in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Lemon socialism

Lemon socialism is a pejorative term for a form of government intervention in which government subsidies go to weak or failing firms, often with the intent of preventing further, systemic damage to what might otherwise be considered a free marketplace. When these subsidies take the form of a full or partial bail-out, as happened during the 2008 financial crisis, they may be seen as a form of state or crony capitalism. The pejorative comes from the perception among laissez-faire capitalists that failing companies are defective lemons that a working free market would replace with better-functioning companies in response to market demand, and the public-sector involvement this type of state intervention shares with socialism. Lemon socialism is not actually socialism: a marketplace still exists, even if that marketplace is not completely free. 
Confusingly, lemon socialism may also refer to government efforts to transition from capitalism to actual socialism; in this case it refers to a deliberate strategy of absorbing the losses entailed in saving jobs within the worst-performing sectors of the economy — the lemons — before the nationalization of more profitable industries.
Origin.
Mark J. Green coined the exact phrase in a 1974 article discussing the utility company, Con Ed.
The sentiment was earlier expressed in the adage "Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor", which was in use by the 1960s, and the notion of privatizing profits and socializing losses dates at least to 1834 and Andrew Jackson's closing of the Second Bank of the United States.
Other languages.
In Icelandic, lemon socialism is known as "Sósíalismi andskotans", meaning "the devil's socialism", a term coined by Vilmundur Jónsson (1889–1971, Iceland's Surgeon General) in the 1930s to criticize alleged crony capitalism in Landsbanki, which term has gained renewed currency in the debate over the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis.
Lemon socialism, or more precisely crony capitalism, is also referred to as Pilsfaldakapítalismi, meaning "skirt capitalism", "pilsfaldur" being the hemline of the skirt, and the term referring to children hiding behind their mothers' skirts after having done something wrong, to criticize the alleged lack of transparency in dealings and reluctance to deal with bad consequences by themselves.

1951–52 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1951-52 campaign was Town's 32nd consecutive season in the 1st Division, but relegation would send Town to the 2nd Division since the 1919-20 season. Under the leadership of George Stephenson, Town recorded some of their worst ever results in their history, including 7-1 defeats by Wolverhampton Wanderers and Sunderland, as well as a 6-2 defeat by Newcastle United.
Review.
Since the end of World War II, Town's league form was in dire need of a boost, but unfortunately George Stephenson's team would soon find out the hard way that staying in Division 1 would be harder than even he imagined. Things weren't made easier with dreadful results against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End, Newcastle United and Sunderland.
Stephenson would leave Leeds Road in March and would be replaced by Stockport County manager Andy Beattie before the end of the season. Town finished in 21st place with 28 points, 3 points behind 20th placed Stoke City.

Authenticity and Modernity Party

The Authenticity and Modernity Party (, PAM; "Hizb Al-Asaleh Wal-Hadatheh") is a Moroccan political party founded by Fouad Ali El Himma, advisor to King Mohammed VI and former interior minister, on 10 August 2008. From its foundation, it has been perceived as backed by the monarchy.
Establishment.
The party was preceded by the Authenticity and Modernity parliamentary bloc, formed after the 2007 parliamentary election, and the think tank "Movement of All Democrats" ("Mouvement de Tous les Démocrats", MTD), both created and led by El Himma. "The Movement of All Democrats" creation communiqué was signed by a number of influential Moroccan public figures including: Aziz Akhenouch, Mustapha Bakkoury, Ahmed Akhchichine, Rachid Talbi Alami, Mohamed Cheikh Biadillah and three human rights activists who had served on Mohammed VI's Equity and Reconciliation Commission which investigated human rights abuses during Hassan II's reign.<br>
A number of political parties merged into PAM: Al Ahd, the National Democratic Party (PND), the Alliance of Liberties, the Environment and Development Party and the Citizens Initiative for Development. The formation's main objective was to hit back at the rise of the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD). It has been characterised as reform-oriented and modernist, but lacks a clear political orientation. It positioned itself between the parties of the Istiqlal Party-led coalition and the oppositional PJD. Because of uncertainties about the organisation's ideology and political strategy, the PND and al-Ahd left it again a short time after they had joined.
As a royal party aimed at maintaining the dominant role of the monarch, it can be compared to the Front for the Defence of Constitutional Institutions (FDIC) of the 1960s, the National Rally of Independents (RNI) of the 1970s and the Constitutional Union (UC) of the 1980s. Despite being its factual leader, El Himma has not taken up a formal post in the party.
Controversy and alleged palace involvement.
Although Fouad Ali El Himma, the close friend of Mohammed VI, was key in the foundation of the party and that many observers—including the American ambassador in Morocco—have described the party as "the palace party", a Moroccan court sentenced politician Abdellah El Kadiri to a fine of 4 million Dirhams (US$500,000) after if judged that alleging that the Palace had a role in the foundation of the party amounts to slander. Abdellah El Kadiri was the presidents of one of the political parties who were dissolved into the Authenticity and Modernity Party.
Development since 2009.
Mohamed Cheikh Biadillah was elected as the first secretary-general on 22 February 2009.
In the 2009 communal elections, the party won the greatest number of seats, replacing the Istiqlal Party as the leading force. Due to defections from other parties, the PAM became a major force in parliament. In October 2009, it took over the presidency of the House of Councillors.
On the eve of the Moroccan parliamentary election, 2011 the PAM formed an alliance with 7 other political parties of very disparate political outlooks, called the "Alliance for Democracy". After the victory of the Islamist PJD, the PAM announced to go into opposition.

Paolo Nutini

Paolo Giovanni Nutini (born 9 January 1987) is a Scottish singer, songwriter and musician from Paisley, Scotland.
Paolo Nutini's debut album, "These Streets", was released by Atlantic Records in the United Kingdom in July 2006 and included the singles "Last Request", "Jenny Don't Be Hasty", "Rewind" and "New Shoes". "Last Request", the most successful, reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. The album peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified 5×platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album remained in the album charts for a record-breaking 196 weeks.
In May 2009 Nutini released his second album, "Sunny Side Up", which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and has produced four singles; "Candy", "Coming Up Easy", "Pencil Full of Lead" and "10/10". It has so far been certified 5×platinum by the BPI. On 19 February 2010, it scooped "Best International Album" at the 2010 Meteor Awards.
Life and career.
Early life and breakthrough (1987–2006).
Nutini's father is of Italian descent, from Barga, Tuscany, and his mother is Scottish. Both his parents are third-generation Scottish heritage.
Paolo Nutini was expecting to follow his father into the family fish and chip shop business. He was first encouraged to sing by his music-loving grandfather, Jackie, and a teacher at his school, St Andrews Academy, who recognised his talent. He left school to work as a roadie and to sell t-shirts for Speedway. He spent three years learning the music business and performing live. He later worked as a studio hand at Glasgow's Park Lane Studio.
His big chance came when he attended a concert staged by 102.5 Clyde 1 for David Sneddon's return to his home town of Paisley at the beginning of 2003. Sneddon was delayed, and as the winner of an impromptu pop quiz, Nutini was given the chance to perform a couple of songs on stage during the wait. The favourable reaction of the crowd impressed another member of the audience, Brendan Moon, who offered to become his manager. Brendan and his business partner Mike Bawden continue to manage Paolo.
Only 17, Nutini moved to London and performed regularly at The Bedford pub in Balham. Other radio and live appearances followed, including two live acoustic spots on Radio London, The Hard Rock Cafe, and support slots for The Rolling Stones, Amy Winehouse and KT Tunstall. Nutini became known for singing with his eyes closed during his entire performances.
When Nutini was younger he was a member of PACE Youth Theatre.
"These Streets" and mainstream breakthrough (2006–2009).
Throughout 2006 Nutini played a number of sold-out concerts across Britain and performed at a wide variety of venues worldwide, including King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow, a TV appearance on Later with Jools Holland, Carnegie Hall in New York, The Montreux Jazz Festival, The Wireless Festival, Oxegen and T in the Park. He supported the Rolling Stones in Vienna and was invited to appear with them again at the Don Valley Stadium in August 2006. He was also booked to appear at the V Festival and The Austin City Limits Music Festival, Texas later in 2006, with a European tour in the autumn. In May 2006, he also played at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Dundee.
On Hogmanay 2006, Nutini appeared on BBC Scotland's Hogmanay Live celebrations, after the official celebrations in Princes Street Gardens were cancelled at short notice due to abysmal weather. He performed several songs in the Great Hall of Edinburgh Castle for the TV audience with little or no rehearsal. On Wednesday 11 April 2007, Nutini performed in a concert that was streamed live via MSN Music.
Nutini performed at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2007 on the famous Pyramid Stage on the second day of the event. Nutini also performed at the British leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium on 7 July 2007, with his set including a cover of "What A Wonderful World", a classic pop tune by Bob Thiele, George David Weiss, and George Douglas. He performed the following day at T in the Park, in Scotland. He performed at the Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert on 10 December 2007, an event that drew enormous international attention as it was the first full live concert performance by Led Zeppelin in 27 years. Scottish independent TV company Volt MediaFix made a one-off documentary of Nutini's US tour. The programme, for the BBC, was scheduled for broadcast on BBC2, on Thursday 7 June throughout Scotland and on Sky channel 990 throughout the rest of Britain.
Nutini's songs have infiltrated American TV shows as well. "Last Request" featured at the end of the "Scrubs" episode "My Words of Wisdom" from Season 6, the first-ever episode of "Gavin & Stacey" and the "One Tree Hill" Season-4 episode "The Birth and Death of the Day." "Million Faces" could be heard at the end of the "Grey's Anatomy" episode "Testing 1–2–3" from Season 3 and is on the Volume 3 Soundtrack. "Rewind" was played at the end of ' Season-5 episode "Broken Home." "Jenny, Don't Be Hasty" was also featured on another member of the "CSI" franchise when it played on "s Season-3-finale, "". "New Shoes" featured in "The Jane Austen Book Club" and in a TV ad for Puma AG during summer 2008. On 24 July 2007, Nutini was awarded The Golden St. Christopher medal by the city of Barga in Italy, the highest honour the city can give, to celebrate his extraordinary contributions to Barga and its people. On 17 September, Nutini performed on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" performing "Last Request". In September 2007, Nutini recorded a short radio show with imeem.com where he listed his top 10 favourite tracks and the reasons behind his choices. In October 2007, Nutini performed for the annual Voodoo Fest held in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 2008, Nutini's music was featured in a movie adaptation of Irvine Welsh's best-selling novel "". On New Year's Eve 2008–09, Nutini performed at the Hogmanay street parties in both Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland, becoming the first act to play both locations on the same day for the event. In The View's 2009 album "Which Bitch?", he is featured singing on the song "Covers."
"Sunny Side Up" and continued musical success (2009–2013).
On 1 June 2009, Nutini released his second studio album "Sunny Side Up", which debuted at number one. The first single from the album "Candy" was released on 25 May. In July, he appeared on "Friday Night with Jonathan Ross", performing "Coming Up Easy". This was released as the second single to the album on 10 August and it debuted at number 62 in the UK Singles Chart on 16 August 2009. On 10 September 2009, Nutini performed "Coming Up Easy" on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. The third single from the album was "Pencil Full of Lead".
The album received a mixed critical reception. Allmusic's Thom Jurek noted the move away from the sound of the debut album: "Nutini has taken huge chunks of America's (and Scotland's) pop and folk pasts and reshaped them in his own image," going on to describe it as "wise beyond this songwriter's years". Andy Gill of "The Independent" commented on Nutini's progress since his debut, saying the album "sees the singer making giant strides in several directions", and going on to say "don't be surprised if, come December, this is one of the year's biggest-selling albums." Neil McCormick of "The Daily Telegraph" was also positive, stating "his joyous second album organically blends soul, country, folk and the brash, horny energy of ragtime swing."
Some reviewers were less impressed. It was described by "The Guardian"'s Caroline Sullivan as "not bad", with opening track "10/10" described as "jaunty enough to make you retch". Graeme Thompson of "The Observer" saw the album as an attempt by Nutini at "rebranding himself as a mongrel hybrid of John Martyn, Otis Redding and Bob Marley".
The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with sales of over 60,000 copies, fighting off strong competition from "Love & War", the debut album of fellow male solo artist Daniel Merriweather. The album performed similarly well on the Irish Albums Chart, debuting at number two behind Eminem's new album before rising to the top of the charts the week after.
The album has been one of the best UK album sales of the year.
On the UK Albums Chart on the week of Monday 19 October, the album move from number 31 to number 5, making the album sell more than The Saturdays' second album. On 3 January 2010 "Sunny Side Up" topped the UK Album Charts for a second time, making the album the first Number one album in the United Kingdom of 2010 and the decade.
On 19 February 2010, Colin Farrell presented Nutini with "Best International Album" for "Sunny Side Up" at the 2010 Meteor Awards.
Paolo Nutini embarked on a world tour with his "Sunny Side Up" album.
The band consisted of, in addition to Paolo:
Donny Little-Guitars, Vocals
Seamus Simon-Drums
Michael McDaid-Bass, Keyboard
Dave Nelson-Guitars, Keyboard, Vocals, Percussion
Gavin Fitzjohn-Trumpet, Saxophone
Ben Edwards - trumpet & flugelhorn, and Tom Pinder - trombone & sousaphone. The brass section are collectively known as the "Horns of Thunder" (a name formed by Paolo himself)
On 27 July 2012, he sang at the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Concert in London's Hyde Park, along with Duran Duran, Snow Patrol and Stereophonics.
"Caustic Love" (2014).
In December 2013 it was revealed that Nutini had recorded a third album called "Caustic Love" which will be released on April 14th, 2014. The album's first single "Scream (Funk My Life Up)" was released on January 27th.
Recording history.
Nutini made his first demo which saw him signed to Atlantic Records in May 2005, shortly after his 18th birthday. He released his first single "These Streets" as a free download in May 2006; this was then followed by his next single "Last Request" which was released on 4 July 2006 and charted at number five on the UK Singles Chart.
In the video for "Last Request", Nutini plays the part of a robber – though this is not revealed until the end.
Nutini's third single, "Jenny Don't Be Hasty", was released on 25 September 2006 and got to number twenty on the UK Singles Chart.
"Rewind" was Nutini's fourth single. It was released on 4 December 2006, and reached number twenty seven on the UK Singles Chart.
His debut album "These Streets", produced by Ken Nelson (who has also worked with Coldplay and Gomez), was released on 17 July 2006 and immediately entered the UK album charts at number three. Many of the songs on the album, including "Last Request" and "Rewind", were inspired by a turbulent relationship with his girlfriend Teri Brogan, and "Jenny Don't Be Hasty" is a true story about encounters with an older woman.
"These Streets", as Paolo himself puts it on his official website, he states, "The album is a little glimpse of some of the experiences I have been through in the last three years". In late 2007 he covered Labi Siffre's "It Must Be Love" for BBC Radio 1's "Radio 1 Established 1967" album. 
His self-produced second album "Sunny Side Up" was released on 1 June 2009.
As of February 2011, Paolo Nutini was in the studio working on new material.
In December 2013 he announced via social networks that his new album "Caustic Love" will be released in April 2014 - Friday April 11th in Ireland, Monday April 14th in UK.

Virgin of Mercy

The Virgin of Mercy is a subject in Catholic art, showing a group of people sheltering for protection under the outspread cloak of the Virgin Mary. It was especially popular in Italy from the 13th to 16th centuries, often as a specialised form of votive portrait, and is also found in other countries and later art, especially Catalonia and Latin America. In Italian it is known as the Madonna della Misericordia (Madonna of Mercy), in German as the Schutzmantelmadonna (Sheltering-cloak Madonna), and in French as the Vièrge au Manteau or Vierge de Miséricorde (Virgin with a cloak or Virgin of Mercy).
Image and origins.
Usually the Virgin is standing alone, though if angels hold up the cloak she is free to hold the infant Christ. The people sheltered normally kneel, and are of necessity shown usually at a much smaller scale. These may represent all members of Christian society, with royal crowns, mitres and a papal tiara in the front rows, or represent the local population. The subject was often commissioned by specific groups such as families, confraternities, guilds or convents or abbeys, and then the figures represent these specific groups, as shown by their dress, or by the 15th century individual portraits. Sometimes arrows rain down from above, which the cloak prevents from reaching the people.
Probably the oldest version known is a small panel by Duccio of c. 1280, with three Franciscan friars under the cloak, in the Pinacoteca in Siena. Here the Virgin sits, only one side of the cloak is extended, and the Virgin holds her child on her knee with her other hand. An miniature of c. 1274 from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia also shows a variant of the motif, as do 13th century paintings in Cyprus, such as an icon in the Byzantine Museum in the Archbishop's Palace, Nicosia. The common factor between all these is the influence and presence of Western mendicant orders, especially the Franciscans, who appear to have been important in spreading this form of iconography.
The immediate inspiration of the iconography comes from a vision reported in the "Dialogus Miraculorum" of the Cistercian Caesar of Heisterbach which circulated widely from about 1230. Beyond that, the origins of the image may relate to rituals and a vision or miracle connected with a famous icon in the Blachernae Church in Constantinople. This gave rise in the Byzantine Rite (Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches) to the Pokrov icons, although the image is not found in Byzantine art. In the Pokrov icons the thought is similar, but the image is usually less literal — the veil with which the Virgin protects mankind is small and held either in her hands or by two angels, though the Western version with a larger cloak is found in some Eastern Orthodox icons, one of a number of Western iconographic features that infiltrated Orthodox art, whether in Cyprus under the Crusaders or 16th-century Eastern Europe.
Usually the image, whether in sculpture or painting, stands by itself, but in the most famous example, the Madonna della Misericordia altarpiece in Sansepolcro by Piero della Francesca, of 1445-62, the subject is the central panel of a large altarpiece, with a smaller Crucifixion above it, and many other panels. In the Spanish "The Virgin of the Navigators" of the 1530s, where those sheltered are a group connected with the Spanish voyages to the New World, including American indigenous peoples, the group is shown over a panorama of ships at rest in a harbour.
In Germany an almost identical image was used featuring Saint Ursula, usually holding her attribute of an arrow to avoid confusion.
The image came in for special derision from Martin Luther, who compared it to "a hen with her chicks".
Other uses.
The term "Virgin of Mercy" is found in a number of other contexts not directly related to the image. It is a common translation of the Eleusa type of icon of the Virgin and Child. The Virgin of Mercy is patron saint of Barcelona, celebrated in the week-long La Mercè festival each year, but in this role is not especially associated with this type of image. The Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, founded, also in Barcelona, in 1218 by Saint Peter Nolasco, has used the image but is not particularly associated with it.
In Santería, the Virgin of Mercy is syncretized with Obatala.

Vicente Alejandro Guillamón

Vicente Alejandro Guillamón (born Spain, June 4, 1930) was a Spanish journalist and writer.
Biography.
Vicente Alejandro Guillamón was born in Onda, Castellon, Spain in 1930, and he was the youngest child of a humble farming and ranching family.
Early career.
He earned a technical accounting degree from the Official Schools of Technical Qualified Accountants of Melilla and Málaga and a journalism degree from the old Official Journalism School of Madrid. He started his journalism career as a correspondent for the "Telegrama del Rif" and later worked for the weekly "Signo", "La Actualidad Económica", the old daily "El Alcazar" published by PESA, the Mexican news bureau AMEX, and the Spanish news bureau EFE, during 17 years, in different positions, like first managing editor of the newly created local bureau of EFE for the Valencia region (Comunidad Valenciana) and editor of national information. He later became the editor of the religion news magazine "Vida Nueva".
In the 1970s, as secondary focus, he taught several classes of Journalism Writing en the newly founded School of Journalism of the University of Valencia. In 1982, he founded the Catholic Union of Media Professionals and Journalist (Unión Católica de Informadores y Periodistas—UCIP), an organization for Catholic journalist and media professional that includes a considerable number of Spanish professionals in that field.
Activist.
In the years of the Francoist regime, he was part of the small group of demochristian activist opposed to the regime. In 1960 he founded, with former members of the Catholic organization JOC (Spanish acronyms of the Catholic Workers Youth), the Unionist Federation of Workers (Federación Sindical de Trabajadores—FST), an underground union of Christian ideals. The union later folded in the Unionist Workers Association (Unión Sindical Obrera—USO). In 1964 Guillamón joined the socialist group that was trying to articulate the Spanish Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Español—PSOE) of that era. He abandoned the socialist party in 1977 after he became disillusioned with the path taken by this party and his uneasiness with the socialists' Marxism, even if moderate, given his upbringing and personal beliefs rooted in the tradition of the Spanish political and classical liberalism. It is important to notice that his grandfather and father were supporters of the Spanish liberal movement. His grandfather was a supporter of the Liberal Party of Sagasta. His father, born in Santa Fe, Isla de Pinos (Cuba), started as a member of the Liberal Party, with whom he ran and was elected mayor of his small town, Espadilla (Castellón), and later, after the party disappeared during the republican era, joined the Radical Party of Alejandro Leroux.
Essayist.
Guillamón wrote several key essays, including:
Theatrical career.
Guillamón was active as a playwright and editor:

Città violenta

Città violenta ("Violent City", also known as "The Family") is a 1970 Italian film directed by Sergio Sollima and starring Charles Bronson, Jill Ireland and Telly Savalas. Set and shot in the city of New Orleans, the film is an urban crime thriller with a plot of hitman revenge.
Plot summary.
The film opens with professional assassin Jeff Heston (Charles Bronson) and mistress Vanessa (Jill Ireland) pursued mercilessly while holidaying in the Virgin Islands. Jeff is shot and left for dead, while Vanessa runs off with his shooter and former business associate Coogan. After his release from prison on a framed murder charge, Jeff tracks the pair to New Orleans. However, after taking revenge on his betrayer and reuniting with Vanessa, Jeff is blackmailed by the very crime boss (Telly Savalas) who framed him, took Vanessa as his mob wife, and who is now intent on having him join his organisation. When Jeff refuses, he is hunted through an unforgiving city only to discover that his real enemy is closer than he realised.
Release and reception.
The film was a commercial hit, and one of Sergio Sollima's more political films, and less successful than the director's earlier Spaghetti Westerns. It was released just as Bronson was emerging from his career as a character actor into a period of stardom as a leading man. That transition was ultimately effected by the success of his later films for United Artists beginning in 1972, and greater fame with Paramount's "Death Wish" (1974), and during this era "Città violenta" received distribution in the United States first by International Co-Productions, and later in even wider release by UA, and retitled "The Family". By the time of its domestic release, UA edited some eight minutes from the Italian version. Only in recent years has this footage been restored by Anchor Bay Entertainment for DVD issue. In a review of the 2008 DVD release, "Slant Magazine" singled out the opening car chase sequence for praise, claiming that it almost outdoes those of "Bullitt" and "The French Connection" "by staging its engine-revving, pedestrian-dodging antics not on the wide streets of American cities but, rather, the narrow, winding pathways (and, in one case, staircases) of a Caribbean island."
Influence.
Danish film director, Nicholas Winding Refn has cited Violent City as on his favorite Italian genre movie.
American film director Quentin Tarantino used samples from the film's Ennio Morricone score in his 2012 film Django Unchained.

Rafael Menjívar Larín

Rafael Menjívar Larín (January 3, 1935 - August 7, 2000) was a Salvadoran economist and politician. An outspoken left-wing critical of the Somoza dictatorship, he was director of the University of El Salvador before being thrown into jail and forced abroad into exile.
Biography.
Born in Santa Ana, El Salvador, Larín was the son of a chauffeur and a housewife, and studied economic sciences in the University of El Salvador between 1956 and 1962. In 1963, at 28 years of age, he graduated as a doctor specialising in the agricultural economy, and almost immediately he was elected dean of the Faculty of Economy. Between 1967 and 1969 he was general manager of the University. In 1969 he published the book, ""Reforma agraria en Guatemala, Bolivia y Cuba" "(The Agrarian Reformation in Guatemala, Bolivia and Cuba"). During this time he travelled to Chile, where during his nine month stay he undertook academic investigation into Chilean agriculture and produced "Reforma agraria chilena" (UES, San Salvador, 1970).
By the end of the 1970s he was elected the director of the University of El Salvador, but on July 19, 1972, the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly deprived the university of its autonomy and it fell under National Army and Police and authority control, a highly controversial move which led to Menjívar Larín and several other high civil servants being imprisoned in their protest. Menjívar Larín was missing during three days in a clandestine cell of the National Police. He was later exiled to Nicaragua, but he was placed under arrest by the orders of dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. In October 1972 he was released and subsequently was sent to Costa Rica.
There in Costa Rica he founded the Central American School of Sociology in 1974, in company of other intellectuals of the region. He was also Secretary General of the Consejo Superior Universitario Centroamericano (CSUCA).
That same year he joined the Fuerzas Populares de Liberación "Farabundo Martí", a left wing party in El Salvador and became acquainted with its leader Salvador Cayetano Carpio.
In January 1976 he travelled with his family to Mexico, where he was granted a scholarship by the Latin American Council of Social Sciences (CLACSO) to obtain a doctorate in political sciences, which he completed in 1979. During this period he wrote numerous books and papers including "Acumulación originaria y desarrollo del capitalismo en El Salvador" and "Formación y lucha del proletariado industrial salvadoreño". At the beginning of 1978 he was named vice president of Latin American Studies in the Political Sciences faculty at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Along with the Salvadoran intellectuals, Rafael Guidos Béjar and Ernesto Richter he contributed to a more specific Central American field of study and chaired debates on agrarian sociology and theory of the state.
In 1980 he worked as a university professor at the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO). However, in 1980 El Salvador went into political turmoil, and Menjívar Larín became increasingly involved in politics. He was appointed president of the External Commission of the Frente Democrático Revolucionario
and was involved in important diplomatic work in favor of the Salvadoran insurgency in Mexico and the rest of Latin America and Europe. In 1981 the FDR moved to France, where diplomacy between the French and the Mexicans and the FMLN began. At the same time, he acted as political adviser to the leader of the FMLN, Salvador Cayetano Carpio, whilst in his spare time was active in the university at Sorbonne.
After the suicide of Carpio on April 12, 1983, which shook the FMLN party and Menjívar Larín, he retired from politics and rededicated himself to academic work. In May 1983 he was appointed Academic Director of director academic of Latin American FLACSO, a position he occupied until 1989. He then became a director in Costa Rica, and during his administration he worked extensively with many noted Central American intellectuals, and was active all over El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. He published over ten books on economics and sociology, and directed investigations into the Costa Rican economy and supported Costa Rican programs of micro-development and the increasing operation of smaller companies.
In 1998 he retired from FLACSO to dedicate himself to his writing. In 1999, nevertheless, he was appotined director of a program of micro-enterprises of the International Labour Convention, but this too was to be short-lived, after being diagnosed with cancer several months later in August of that year. He would almost exactly a year after being diagnosed, succumbing to the disease on August 7, 2000. He was buried in the Montesacro cemetery, of San Jose, Costa Rica. He was survived by his sons who have become noted academics in their own right including the writer and journalist Rafael Menjívar Ochoa and the sociologist and historian Mauritius Menjívar Ochoa.

<doc id="19559447" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19559447" title="Emmanuel Goldstein">
Emmanuel Goldstein

Emmanuel Goldstein is a character in George Orwell's classic dystopian novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four". He is the number one enemy of the state according to the Party. He is depicted as the head of a mysterious (and possibly fictitious) anti-party organization called "The Brotherhood" and to have written the book "The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism". Despite being a key part of the story, he is only actually seen and heard on telescreen, and may in fact be nothing more than a useful propaganda fabrication of the Ministry of Truth. 
Character history.
In the novel, Goldstein is rumoured to be a former top member of the Party and an early associate of its leader, "Big Brother". Goldstein is said to have broken away early in the movement and started an organization known as "The Brotherhood", dedicated to the fall of the Party. Ostensibly "The Brotherhood" is organized into cells, with each member required to read "The Book", supposedly written by Goldstein, "The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism". Goldstein is always the subject of the "Two Minutes Hate", a daily, 2-minute period beginning at 11:00 a.m. at which an image of Goldstein is shown on the telescreen, which helps to ensure that popular devotion towards Big Brother is continuous.
The novel raises but leaves unanswered the questions of whether Goldstein or "The Brotherhood" really exist. When asked by Winston in the torture room, Inner Party member O'Brien adamantly refuses to reveal whether "The Brotherhood" truly exists:
O'Brien claims that Goldstein's book was in fact written by the Party leadership, including himself, but this statement still leaves the questions of Goldstein and the Brotherhood's existence unanswered, as it could have been an untrue statement made by O'Brien in order to manipulate Winston's thinking and break his spirit.
The reader may surmise that a political opposition to Big Brother — namely, Goldstein — was psychologically necessary in order to distract, unite and focus the anger of the people of Oceania. Ostensibly, Goldstein serves an important role as both a convenient scapegoat for the totalitarian regime in "Nineteen Eighty-Four", and justifying reason for surveillance and elimination of civil liberties.
Trotsky as potential real-life origin.
Not long after the novel's appearance,
a number of contemporary commentators noticed that the biography, appearance, writing style and political thought of Emmanuel Goldstein closely paralleled that of Leon Trotsky. Born Lev Bronshtein, Trotsky was a close associate of Russian revolutionary Lenin and later the chief rival of Stalin, the latter of whom branded Trotsky a traitor and expelled him from the Soviet Union in 1927. In exile, Trotsky wrote "The Revolution Betrayed", denouncing Stalin and the Soviet Union. During the Great Purges of the 1930s, Stalin's propaganda invariably depicted Trotsky as the instigator of all supposed plots and acts of sabotage. In 1940, he was murdered in Mexico by Ramón Mercader, a Stalinist agent.
In 1954, Isaac Deutscher wrote that Goldstein's book in "Nineteen Eighty-Four "was intended as a "paraphrase" of "The Revolution Betrayed".
In 1956, Irving Howe described Goldstein's book as "clearly a replica" of Trotsky's "The Revolution Betrayed", writing that the parts that seemed to be imitating Trotsky were "among the best passages" of the novel. Critic Adrian Wanner, writing in a collection of essays edited by Harold Bloom, described Goldstein's book as a "parody" of "The Revolution Betrayed", noting that Orwell was deeply ambivalent about Trotsky. Orwell wrote of Trotskyism that
Contemporary comparisons.
Richard Nixon.
The widespread vilification of President Richard Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal inspired commentary comparing his treatment in the media with the Two Minutes Hate sessions focused on Emmanuel Goldstein.
Nixon's earlier decision to go to China, long considered a Cold War foe, had earlier inspired comparisons with Emmanuel Goldstein's analysis of the shifting alliances of the three superpowers in "Nineteen Eighty-Four".
Osama bin Laden.
Goldstein has also been compared to former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
Drawing parallels between Goldstein and Osama a week after the September 11 attacks, Professor William L. Anderson at Frostburg State University wrote a column for LewRockwell.com entitled "Osama and Goldstein". 
Legal scholar Cass Sunstein, in his 2009 book "Worst-Case Scenarios", coined the term "Goldstein Effect", described as "the ability to intensify public concern by giving a definite face to the adversary, specifying a human source of the underlying threat." According to Sunstein, since the U.S.-led War on Terror so heavily associated terrorism with Osama, the outrage intensified in similar ways as displayed in "Nineteen Eighty-Four". However, he also pointed out how Saddam Hussein, to a great degree, and George W. Bush (to a much lesser degree) had been subject to the same Goldstein Effect.
Others.
The computer underground publisher Eric Corley used the name Emmanuel Goldstein as a pseudonym.
In the 1995 film "Hackers", Matthew Lillard plays a character named Emmanuel Goldstein, who makes a reference to "Nineteen Eighty-Four" with the line: "'1984'? Yeah, right. That's a typo."

She-Devils On Wheels is a 1968 American exploitation film about an all-female motorcycle gang called The Man-Eaters, directed and produced by Herschell Gordon Lewis.
Plot.
The Man Eaters are led by Queen (Betty Connell). The gang's main activity is racing each other, then having a wild orgy at their clubhouse afterward. The race determines the order in which the girls get to pick a man. One of the fastest held rules of the group is that "all men are mothers" and no Man-Eater falls in love. New initiate Karen (Christie Wagner), strains these rules as the gang finds her choosing the same man, Bill (David Harris), several times. The Man-Eaters test Karen's loyalty by making her drag a well beaten Bill from the back of her motorcycle. Karen's loyalty is tested again when her ex-boyfriend, Ted (Rodney Bedell), urges Karen to leave the gang because of the danger presented by a rival gang of hot-rodders led by a man named Joe-Boy (John Weymer).
Critical reception.

Astrud Gilberto

Astrud Gilberto (born March 29, 1940) is a Brazilian samba and bossa nova singer. She is best known for her performance of the Grammy Award-winning song "The Girl from Ipanema".
Biography.
Astrud Gilberto was born Astrud Weinert, the daughter of a Brazilian mother and a German father, in the state of Bahia, Brazil. She was raised in Rio de Janeiro. She married João Gilberto in 1959 and emigrated to the United States in 1963, continuing to reside in the US from that time. Astrud and João divorced in the mid-1960s and she began a relationship with her musical partner, American jazz saxophone player Stan Getz.
Gilberto sang on the influential album "Getz/Gilberto" featuring João Gilberto, Stan Getz, and Antonio Carlos Jobim, despite having never sung professionally before this recording. Gilberto's recording of "The Girl from Ipanema" established her as a Bossa Nova singer. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. In 1964, Gilberto appeared in the films "Get Yourself a College Girl" and "The Hanged Man". Her first solo album was "The Astrud Gilberto Album" (1965). Upon moving to the United States, she went on tour with Getz. Beginning as a singer of Bossa Nova and American jazz standards, Gilberto started to record her own compositions in the 1970s. She has recorded songs in Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Japanese.
In 1982, Gilberto's son Marcelo joined her group, touring with her for more than a decade as bassist. In addition, he collaborated as co-producer of the albums "Live in New York" (1996) and "Temperance" (1997). Her son Gregory Lasorsa played guitar on the "Temperance" album on the song "Beautiful You", which features singer Michael Franks.
Gilberto received the Latin Jazz USA Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1992, and was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1996, she contributed to the AIDS benefit album "Red Hot + Rio" produced by the Red Hot Organization, performing the song "Desafinado" (Portuguese for "slightly out of tune", or "off key") along with George Michael. Although she did not officially retire, Gilberto announced in 2002, that she was taking "indefinite time off" from public performances.

1998 Winchester 400

The twenty-ninth annual Snap-On Tools Winchester 400 motor race (run yearly since 1970) was held under All-Pro Series sanction on September 27, 1998, at the Winchester Speedway, Indiana (USA).
Becoming the third different winner in as many years, Derrick Gilchrist was crowned the 1998 "Winchester 400" Champion. The Raleigh, North Carolina, native flew past Steven Howard on lap 299 and beat points leader Freddie Query across the finish line.
The race.
Jeff Fultz of Milford, Ohio, drove his Jani-King Chevrolet to the pole-position with a lap of 15.990 seconds (112.570 MPH). Fellow front-row starter Hal Goodson leaped to the lead at the start of the 400-lap grind. Fultz would settle into second until moving past Goodson for the lead on lap 55. Fultz would hold the lead until Goodson went back in front under caution to lead the 87th circuit. Starting seventh, Hoosier Brian Ross of the Kendall Late Model Series, took the lead on lap 88 and would hold the top spot until most of the leaders pitted under caution on lap 155.
Fultz stayed out and retook the lead as Ross and the other lead-lap machines tried to run him down. Ross’ day ended on lap 213 when suspension failure sent him bouncing off the first turn wall. After a round of pit stops under that caution, Steven Howard showed the way. Gilchrist took his first lead of the day in his Robert Hake-prepared machine on lap 299 after solving vapor lock problems. Once in front, he went on to lead the final 102 laps and score his second series win of the 1998 season and $14,900. Query finished second, 1.074 seconds behind the leader with Howard in third, the last car on the lead lap. One lap back was Ron Young in fourth and fifth-place Scott Riggs.

Jack Whitten

Jack Whitten (born 1939) is an American abstract painter.
Biography.
Whitten was born in Bessemer, Alabama, the son of a seamstress, twice widowed. His father, a coal-miner, died while Whitten was a child. Planning a career as an army doctor, Whitten entered pre-medical studies at Tuskegee Institute where he took some pilot training and became inspired by George Washington Carver's legacy as a scientist, inventor and artist. He also traveled to nearby Montgomery, Alabama to hear Martin Luther King, Jr speak during the Montgomery Bus Boycott and was deeply moved by his vision for a changed America.
Whitten went to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to begin studying art and became involved in Civil Rights demonstrations there. Angered by the violent resistance to change he experienced he moved to New York City in 1960. He enrolled immediately at the Cooper Union, graduating with a bachelor's degree in fine art in 1964. Afterwards he remained in New York as a working artist, heavily influenced by the abstract expressionists then dominating the art community.
Whitten's work was featured in the Annual Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1972. The Whitney mounted a solo exhibition of his paintings in 1974. He has also had individual shows at numerous private galleries and universities, including a 10-year retrospective in 1983 at the Studio Museum in Harlem and an exhibition of memorial paintings in 2008 at the Atlanta Contemporary Arts Center in Atlanta, Georgia.
Throughout his career, Whitten has concerned himself with the techniques and materials of painting and the relationship of artworks to their inspirations. At times he has pursued quickly-applied gestural techniques akin to photography or printmaking. At other times the deliberative and constructive hand is evident. The "New York Times" labeled him the father of a "new abstraction".
When the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center occurred, Whitten was at his studio on Lispenard Street in Tribeca watching the first plane hit. He spent two years constructing a monumental elegiac and emotion-filled panel, with ashes embedded into it, as a memorial of the day.
Currently a retrospective exhibition is being organized. The Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego will open this travelling exhibition in 2014.
Whitten is represented by Alexander Gray Associates in New York; Zeno X gallery in Antwerp, Belgium; and Guido Maus, beta pictoris gallery / Maus Contemporary in Birmingham, AL.
Whitten and his wife, Mary reside in Queens, New York. He also owns a vacation home in Crete.

Chandi had been stated as "Chandi Sub-district Division" until the announcement of cancellation of "sub-district division" system and changed all sub-district divisions to be a "Municipality" instead since 24 May 1999. 
Chandi municipality comprised 6.5 km2. and then in 2007, the Ministry of Interior annulled "Chandi Sub-district Administrative" and united with Chandi Municipality. Now, the totally area of Chandi Municipality has been covered all the sub-district with 33.23 km2.
Chandi City Municipality will be administered by 'Major' who won the election vote. The mayor will be on the position up to 4 years by having 2 mayor assistants.
History.
100 years ago, there was the first group of Fuzhou Chinese immigrants came to and chose to live in the area where was not far from the canal. The settlers discovered that the land was much better suited for rubber plantations and the enrichment of nature resources in this area. So they persuade other groups of Chinese who was being in other provinces and in China came to settle down in this area. So, the Chinese community in Chandi had been bigger and became one of commercial center of district due to the nature of Chinese who really good at trading. At first, there wasn't a name to call this area but mostly Thai call here as "Jeendee" because the generosity of Chinese who lived in this area had been very well known. But there was another small village (Close to Nabon district), named "Chandi". So, there were many persons getting confused and called "Jeendee village" as "Chandi". This name has been confused for long time till people call "Jeendee" as "Chandi" until now.
Chandi grew from a small settlement with rubber tapping and latex processing as the main economic activity. The town was flanked by various Chinese settlements comprising mostly descendants of immigrants from the Kutien district (古田县)of Fuzhou, China. The rapid development of the urban settlements saw the plantation and estate areas developed and converted into residential and commercial areas.
Chinese in Chandi.
Chinese school: There is one Chinese school in Chandi, namely "Jaroenwittaya School" (振华学校). Established since 1937 by Fuzhou Chinese immigrant, now the school is administrated by Chandi Educational Foundation() . Actually, there was another one school which was organized by the same foundation, so it was assembled with "Jaroenwittaya School" since 2005 
Chinese shrines There were 2 Chinese shrines for traditional religious worship.
Chinese associations
First group of settlers: 
Surname: Khajornsuwan, Jiratthikul, Tangsatjatham, Tanvaravuttikul
Chinese Chandi in new settlement areas.
Thailand: Bangkok, Lamae, Map Ammarit (Chumphon), Ban Chandi (Rayong)
Abroad Taiwan 
Some of Chinese who moved to Chandi in the past decided to go back China when they could earn money enough as well as wait for the politic stability in order to re-settle down in their hometown. Therefore, some of those who could collect the money and had the family, they would try to send their sons or daughter to Taiwan first for waiting the political stability in China. But mainland China has changed the political system permanently, plus the aware of homeland security. Some of people who was born in Chandi and wait for going back to China need to settle down in Taiwan automatically until today.
Economics.
From 1930 to 1990, rubber was the sole commercial crop cultivated by the farmers. The economic wellbeing of the population invariably fluctuated in tandem with the prices of rubber. In the early 1980s, the lack of agriculture area in Chandi made the migration of many farming families to new settlements and lastly the diversification of cultivation to include other commercial crops, the most important of which is the planting of oil palms. In the early 1990s, it led to a significant development: the emigration of the younger populace to Bangkok, to seek a better living.
Chandi has become one of transportation center in Chawang district because there are many highway passing by Chandi and also there are many trains stopping at Chandi train station. Therefore, the accessibility to connect other districts and provinces has centered in Chandi particularly. 
In terms of the importance of commercial center, Chandi becomes the center of banking, trading, office, para rubber market and transportation since 1980. The cash flow in Chandi market was estimated around 50 millions baht daily and it got high possibility to getting higher continuously due to the number of investment in this area.
In 2008, the international hyper market brand "Tesco Lotus" interested in investment in Chandi area due to the location potential and rate purchasing power in the area. Unfortunately, this project was suspended by Chandi protestors who believed that the arriving of hyper market would destroy the way of local life and commercial system in the area.

<doc id="19559999" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19559999" title="Accordion reed ranks and switches">
Accordion reed ranks and switches

A reed rank inside accordions refers to a single full set of the reeds that are the means to achieve the instrument's sound range. These reed ranks are located in the "reed chamber". Most accordions to this date typically have anywhere between 2-4 reed ranks on the treble side and 3-5 reed ranks on the bass side that can usually be selected individually and/or be combined differently to provide a range of different timbres, by use of switches arranged by register from high to low. More of the top-line expensive accordions may contain 5-6 reed blocks on the treble side for different tunings, typically found in accordions which stress musette sounds.
How many reeds an accordion has is defined by a method that looks like a fraction. For example, a 4/5 accordion has 4 reeds on the treble side and 5 on the bass side. A 3/4 accordion has 3 reeds on the treble sides and 4 on the bass side.
Reed ranks are classified by either organ 'foot-length' stops or instrument names. Visually, they each have a fixed dot in a three-level icon as displayed in the photo on the right and tables below. These icons display when more than one reed-rank is in use.
Register stop classifications.
The pitch of a single bank of reeds is traditionally defined in a similar manner to the organ stops of a pipe organ. A bank that sounds at unison pitch when keys are depressed is called 8'; (pronounced "eight-foot") pitch: alluding to the length of the lowest-sounding organ pipe in that rank, which is approximately eight feet. For the same reason, a stop that sounds an octave higher is at 4' pitch, and one that sounds an octave lower than unison pitch is at 16' pitch.
Most reed registers are normally in relative octave tuning, but rarely, some instruments have a reed bank tuned to a Fifth relative to the 8' stop (or some octave of that). This is a similar arrangement to stops for a pipe organ.
To hear how these sound on their own, see the first three rows of the table below.
Register switches.
Register switches control how contrasting timbres are produced. They control which reed ranks are enabled (opened up) or disabled (closed off), in a similar manner to the register switches controlling the organ stops of a pipe organ: a single reed rank, or several simultaneous reed ranks. Unlike a pipe organ, only one switch can be active at any given time. Here are a few examples of right-hand manual switches on a typical large accordion (Smaller boxes with fewer reed banks may have fewer switches or even none):
In addition to the master switch located with the other switches shown above, professional grade accordions often have a least one extra master switch: either a "chin" master at the top of the instrument or "palm" master switch located at the side of the keyboard. These are located in positions that allow for faster changes to the full sound during playing.
Cassotto.
More expensive accordions have a feature called a "Cassotto" (Italian for "box"), also referred to as a "tone chamber", in the treble (right-hand) reed section. In this design, certain reed sets (usually one set of middle reeds, and the set of low reeds) are mounted at a 90-degree angle to the remaining reeds. The sound from these specially-mounted reeds must then travel farther, and along a different path, before leaving the instrument, muting the harmonics ("partials") of those reeds and creating a distinctively mellow, refined sound. The sound of cassotto bassoon (low) reeds is particularly favored by jazz accordionists.
The cassotto design requires a sophisticated treble mechanism where each key must open and close air passages not only for reeds mounted at the traditional angle, but also for air passages at a relative 45-degree angle (for the cassotto reeds). To do this properly, each rod and pad must be positioned precisely in relation to its right-angle counterpart.

"Parle à ma main" (French for "Talk to the hand") is a 2006 song recorded by French act Fatal Bazooka featuring Yelle. It was the fifth and last single from the album "T'as vu", and was released in November 2007. It was particularly successful in France and Belgium (Wallonia), where it was a number one hit for many weeks.
Music video.
In the music video, David Guetta's hit single "Love Is Gone" can be heard at the beginning and is sung by Fatal Bazooka (portrayed by Michaël Youn). French actor Vincent Desagnat features in the video, while French singers Vitaa and Diam's are mentinoned in the lyrics. A sequence in a gymnasium is inspired by the music video for Gwen Stefani's "Hollaback Girl," particularly in the featuring of a brass band and some majorettes.
Chart performances.
In France, the single entered the singles chart at number two on 1 December 2007, then climbed to number one and stayed there for seven weeks. Then after three weeks at number two, it dropped quickly. It totaled 13 weeks in the top ten, 16 weeks in the top 50 and 19 weeks on the chart (top 100).
In Belgium (Wallonia), "Parle à ma main" charted for 22 weeks in the top 40 from 15 December 2007. It started at number 24, reached the top ten two weeks later, and eventually topped the chart for four weeks. It remained in the top ten for 16 weeks .
It achieved a moderate success in Switzerland. It charted for 17 weeks, with a peak at number 31 in its third week, on 9 December 2007.

HAUNT

Haunt was a straightforward but engagingly irreverent text-based mainframe computer game. It was created in OPS4 language in 1979 by John E. Laird.
In Haunt, the player explores a haunted house and encounters clues (flight speed of an African swallow), wacky creatures (rampaging moose), and random elements (the bus) as s/he tries to find treasure and escape the house alive. 
The game ran on DEC-10 & DEC-20 mainframes running TOPS-10 or TOPS-20. According to the author, copies exist somewhere in Carnegie Mellon University's archive; although Laird considered rewriting it in an updated language, that did not happen. On his personal website, Laird wrote " I'm afraid that Haunt is really dead."
Laird is now a professor at University of Michigan. As he describes: "It violated most, if not all, of the design guidelines for good interactive fiction in that you could get killed much too easily, the puzzles were way too obscure (many based on Saturday morning cartoons from my youth), but it had a certain charm.

Stradella bass system

The Stradella Bass System (sometimes called "standard bass") is a buttonboard layout equipped on the bass side of many accordions, which uses columns of buttons arranged in a circle of fifths; this places the principal major chords of a key (I, IV and V) in three adjacent columns. Each column contains, in order:
The following chart shows a common 120-button Stradella layout.
In modern accordions, each chord button sounds three individual pitches. Early accordions sounded four pitches for the seventh and diminished chords. Modern Stradella systems omit the 5th from these two chords, allowing for more versatility. For example, an augmented seventh chord can be created by using the dominant seventh chord button and adding an augmented 5th from the right-hand manual or from one of the bass or counterbass buttons.
In most Russian layouts the diminished seventh chord row is moved by one button, so that the C diminished seventh chord is where the F diminished seventh chord would be in a standard Stradella layout; this is done in order to achieve a better reachability with the forefinger.
Register switches.
The larger and more expensive accordions can also have on the Stradella bass side, some Register switches, similar in concept to the treble register switches.

Howell Davies

Sir (William) Howell Davies (13 December 1851 – 26 October 1932) was a Welsh-born leather merchant and Liberal politician.
Family.
Davies was born in Narberth in Pembrokeshire, the son of Thomas Davies. He was educated privately. In 1882 he married Ada Mary Hosegood, the daughter of a Bristol Justice of the Peace. Lady Davies died in 1948 at the age of 91. They had one son and three daughters. Their son was Lt-Col. Owen Stanley Davies DSO who died in 1926 of wounds he received in the Great War, having undergone many operations. By religion Davies was a Wesleyan Methodist.
Business.
Davies moved to Bristol and established himself in the leather trade, eventually becoming a highly successful tannery owner and leather merchant employing a large workforce. He also acquired directorships and was a Director of the UK Temperance and General Provident Institution.
Local politics.
Like many successful Victorian and Edwardian businessmen, Davies was eager to serve his community through municipal politics and at the same time provide himself a stepping-stone to further advancement. He first joined Bristol City Council in 1884 and was made an Alderman in 1889. He was elected Mayor of Bristol in 1896. He served for a time as Leader of the Liberal Party on Bristol City Council and was sometime President of the Chamber of Commerce. During his time on the Council Davies acquired extensive Municipal experience being Chairman of Bristol Docks Committee between 1899 and 1908 and was Chairman during the construction of, and at the time of the opening of the Royal Edward Dock which was formally opened by King Edward VII in July 1908. Davies was also Chairman of Bristol Finance Committee, 1902–29. For more than 46 years Davies took a leading role in political life of the city of Bristol and in 1908 he was knighted for municipal services in the King’s birthday honours list.
Parliamentary politics.
Davies first stood for Parliament at the general election of 1900, the so-called Khaki election. He had been adopted as the Liberal candidate for Bristol South before the sitting MP (Sir Edward Stock Hill) had decided to retire. His Conservative opponent was Walter Hume Long. 
Long won that election and even though the political tide had turned decisively against them by the time of the 1906 general election the Conservatives believed they would hold Bristol South, evenly if only narrowly. However Bristol South was one of many unexpected gains for the Liberals in their 1906 general election landslide victory. The Liberals took three of the four Bristol seats at the election and as late as 14 January, Liberal Chief Whip, Herbert Gladstone had confidently expected Walter Long to hold on in Bristol South. However Davies beat Long with a majority of 2,692 votes. He held the seat at the next election in January 1910 albeit by the narrow margin of 271 votes. As a consequence, Davies expected a hard fought contest at the December 1910 election. Divisions in the Bristol Unionist ranks may have helped divert Tory attentions from the real fight. H Chatterton who had stood for the Conservatives in January 1910 was dropped by the Tories in favour of a different candidate and decided to put himself forward as an Independent Unionist, only withdrawing from the election at the last moment. In the end Davies was able to hold his seat over the new Conservative candidate J T Francombe with a majority of 138. 
Davies never held ministerial office but he was appointed to the important Parliamentary Select Committee on National Expenditure in 1920.
At the 1918 general election Davies was the representative of the Coalition government and was opposed only by Labour candidate T C Lewis, over whom he had a majority of 7,352 votes. He stood down from Parliament at the 1922 general election but continued to play a part in Liberal politics, representing the South West on the National Liberal Council.
Death.
Davies died at Bristol on 26 October 1932.

Ashina Jiesheshuai

Ashina Jieshe'er ( / Pinyin: āshǐnà jiēshèěr, Wade-Giles: ashihna chieh-she-erh, Middle Chinese: (Guanyun) ) or Ashina Jiesheshuai (Chinese: / , Pinyin: āshǐnà jiēshèshuai, Wade-Giles: ashihna chieh-she-shuai, Middle Chinese (Guangyun) , b: ?- d. summer 639 ) was a member of the Turkic noble family Ashina clan of Eastern Turkic khaganate and general (Zhonglangjang) of the Tang Dynasty.
Background.
He is one of Shibi Khan's sons and the younger brother of Ashina Shibobi (), who was vassal khagan of Tang dynasty and used the title of Tölis Khan ().
Tang China defeated The Eastern Turkic khaganate and the khaganate became the vassal of Tang China in 630. During this period some Turkic nobles were enrolled in Chinese army. Ashina Jiesheshuai was among these nobles. He was planning to assassinate Taizong.
Jiucheng Palace raid.
By summer 639, as Ashina Jiesheshuai had not been favored by Tang Dynasty's Emperor Taizong (because he had falsely accused his brother Ashina Shibobi of treason, which Emperor Taizong found despicable), he formed a conspiracy with Ashina Shibobi's son Ashina Hexiangu () to assassinate Emperor Taizong at his summer palace, Jiucheng Palace (九成宮, in modern Linyou County, Shaanxi). They had planned to wait for Li Zhi the Prince of Jin to depart from the palace in the morning and use that opportunity to attack the palace. On the day they planned, May 19, however, Li Zhi did not leave the palace due to storm and immediately afterwards raining heavily rain. Ashina Jiesheshuai attacked the palace anyway, engaging the palace guards, but the palace guards was supported by support troops who came outside. Ashina Jiesheshuai and his comrades went to the stable and stole some 20 horses. They ran away to the north but were arrested by pursuers near the Wei River and killed. Ashina Hexiangu was exiled to Lingbiao.
After this incident, however, the officials began advocating sending Turks (or Tujue as they were known to the Chinese) away from the heart of the state. In fall 639, Emperor Taizong created a Göktürk-Tujue prince who had served him faithfully, Li Simo (né Ashina Simo) as the khan of a newly recreated Eastern Tujue state (as Qilibi Khan), giving him all of the Tujue and Hu who had surrendered as his subordinates, to be settled north of the Great Wall and the Yellow River. However, the Tujue people were fearful of Xueyantuo and initially refused to head to their new location. Emperor Taizong issued an edict to Xueyantuo's khan Yi'nan that he and Li Simo keep their peace and not attack each other, and after receiving from Yi'nan the assurance that he would not attack, the Tujue people advanced to the new location.
Aftermath.
Jiesheshuai's attempted rebellion was unsuccessful. But in 681 they revolted against Tang dynasty and re-established Eastern Turkic khaganate.
Cultural influences.
A prominent Turkish nationalist Nihal Atsız used some characteristics of Ashina Jiesheshuai for a fictional character named Kür Şad in the novel "Bozkurtların Ölümü" ("The deaths of gray wolves"). However in the novel, the father of Kürşad is not Shibi Khan but Chuluo Khan (Çuluk Han).

In 1844 he was the secretary of the Comisión Central de Monumentos. He was co-director with Antonio de Zabaleta of the ephemeral "Boletín Español de Arquitectura", the first Spanish journal dedicated exclusively to architecture. It was only in publication from 1 June to December 1846. In 1852 he published the complete works of Íñigo López de Mendoza. It was Amador de los Ríos who first used the term "mudejarismo" to describe a style of architecture in 1859. 
In 1861 he published the first volume of "Historia crítica de la literatura española", the first general history of Spanish literature written in Spain. It was to remain incomplete. Ideologically Amador de los Ríos, a liberal and romantic, conceives of Spain as a unit, at once Roman Catholic and Castilian, a constitutional monarchy (thought it was not one yet) united with its past by an "idea luminosa" (luminous idea). Countering the foreign historians who regard medieval Spain as a backwater, he defends Spanish literature as the foremost among those which appeared after the Fall of Rome. Though he only covered the Middle Ages, he demonstrated that he regarded Spanish American literature as part of the Spanish tradition. In another work, "Historia social, política y religiosa de los judíos de España", he accepts the Spanish Jewish literature as part of the tradition, since it "bloomed" in Spanish soil. Unlike Adolf de Castro, however, he did not condemn the Spanish Inquisition.

Free-bass system

A free-bass system is a system of bass buttons on an accordion, arranged to give the performer greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual of the instrument and to forming one's own chords, by providing a buttonboard of single-note buttons with a range of three octaves or more, in contrast to the standard Stradella bass system which only allows bass notes (range of a major seventh) and preset major, minor, dominant seventh, and diminished chords. The term "free-bass system" refers to various left-hand manual systems that provide this functionality:
History.
By the year 1900, the Stradella bass system had principally reached its current construction with 120 buttons over 6 rows. However, while that setup worked well for major and minor music accompanied by many chords, the performer would only have access to about a single octave of notes while playing - two with a timely shift of registers. The problem was solved in the early 1900s by adding three rows of chromatically ordered single notes next to the standard bass.. In 1900 in Moscow Russian master Bakanov made a garmon with piano keyboards for both right and left hands. From 1906 the brothers Kiselevs' factory in Tula began to produce bayans with the three-row free-bass left keyboard. 
Popularizing the free-bass accordion.
The Hohner company decided to enlarge the market for accordions by turning the instrument from its traditional music roots into an established instrument for orchestras. An orchestra was put together, touring Germany to introduce the new concept. The company also supplied sheet music for this new type of accordion. Although these were reportedly popular, it wasn't until later when the instrument became more widespread.
In North Europe, free-bass accordionist Mogens Ellegaard helped popularize the instrument and achieve compositions for it. In an interview he describes how the free-bass accordion was still practically non-existent in his childhood (born 1935), but how composers in his native Denmark began to write works for him since 1958. In 1968 he arranged the manufacture of accordions with nothing but free-bass layouts to accommodate newcomers, as free-bass accordions would otherwise always include standard bass.
In some Russian, Canadian and European music conservatories, free bass accordion is considered a serious instrument for study and there is now a large modern repertoire for it. In the United States, free bass instruments are much less well known despite attempts to popularize them by Palmer and Hughes and the Giulietti Accordion Company in the 1960s and 1970s. During this period several American accordionists demonstrated the unique orchestral sound of the instrument through live performances as well as by composing original works which featured the instrument. Included among this group was John Serry, Sr. whose "Concerto For Free Bass Accordion" was completed during the 1960s. ("See Accordion music genres")

Chicago Better Housing Association

History.
The Chicago Better Housing Association (CBHA) is an open housing organization originally created in the 1950s to promote open housing, as part of the fledgling civil rights movement that following the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision by the Supreme Court in 1954. It was created by a coalition of civil rights groups including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and advocates for equal housing.
Later in the early 1960s, the group joined forces with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), headed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Chicago Chapter of the NAACP, headed by the Rev. Herbert C. Martin, and the local black church community, and Operation Breadbasket to push for legislation for open housing. When federal and state open housing legislation was passed, they were one of the groups that worked with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the local successor to the SCLC which after Dr. King's death became Operation PUSH, along with CORE and the NAACP, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, to provide "testers" to trap unwary and unscrupulous landlords and real estate firms that block busting and were steering blacks, Hispanics and Asians away from or to certain neighborhoods.
After a ruling in the early 1990s by the Supreme Court making it harder for testers to be used as a weapon against civil rights violations, and after the cumulative effect of 12 years of conservative, anti-civil rights judges being appointed to the federal courts by the Reagan and Bush (Snr.) administrations, the CBHA shifted its focus away from litigation and toward development of affordable housing and redevelopment work in blighted underprivileged communities.
The CBHA gained recent momentum with a $100,000 Illinois housing grant from the Department of Economic Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DECO) to create a botanic garden out of a vacant lot in South Side Englewood as a demonstration project. The CBHA was subsequently awarded an additional $20,000 supplemental in 2007 at the request of then Illinois State Senator Barack Obama. Those awards were to be part of a broader plan that did not involve state money that was to encompass a 12-block area that was going to create neighbor space along an elevated train line which would have involved the construction of up 50 townhouses along with bike paths, light shopping, park areas, etc. The plan failed to materialize fully when federal funds were diverted to the second Gulf War and budget deficits soared due to war-time efforts.
The "Englewood Botanic Garden Project" involving the one city block development also became the subject of political controversy since it involved then State Senator and the eventually US Senator and then US Presidential Candidate Barack Obama, and the volunteer who had agreed to see the project through to the end, a former Englewood resident, Kenny Smith. Smith worked with his cousin in the automobile repossession business for a time. As announced at a January 2000 news conference at Englewood High School. The garden, which only involved one city block, was eventually to be part of a broader federal program that eventually would lead to the development of "an oasis of trees and paths" instead of a series of debris-filled lots and this particular vacant lot full of weeds and garbage under the Chicago "L" mass transit tracks. The state grant was for this one-block area where a gazebo and park area was to be constructed as part of a larger and more ambitious plan that did not involve state funding which was to consist of trees and paths to run between 59th Place and 62nd Place. Organizers promised to raise $1.1 million for that and similar lots. The garden site is situated near where Smith was developing affordable housing.
In a classic series of political tit for tat, the "Chicago Sun-Times", acting on information fed to them by political operatives of Senator John McCain, and the Illinois Green Association which was actually the Illinois Nurserymens' Association, a for-profit lobby group run by a former industry lobbyist, encouraged the "Sun-Times" to run a series of stories claiming that the Chicago Better Housing Association didn't do any work for the grant money except get paid for it. In fact, the work they were paid for was done. The "Sun-Times" article carried a number of false claims in it that were disproven by pictures and documents and still they refused to retract the previous articles. Instead they reran the early articles in the subsequent stories repeating the false claims when they knew better the second and third times through.
The CBHA sued the "Sun-Times" and its parent corporation, Hollinger International, for libel, claiming the information in the published articles is false. Claims have also been filed against the "New York Daily News" and Illinois Green. The claim stated that the work was done and proof was submitted to the state and municipal agencies showing invoices, progress photos and paid checks. However, even after the CBHA demanded a retraction, after showing the reporters proof that their story contained false statements, the "Sun-Times" not only re-ran the story (twice subsequently) but also expanded on it. The lawsuit had to be dropped because the "Sun-Times" declared bankruptcy so all lawsuits against it were enjoined by the bankruptcy court. The CBHA resolved its claims against the "Daily News" which, as part of the settlement, published a retraction.
Affordable housing.
On November 7, 2002, the City of Chicago Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Coordinating Council voted and recommended to Mayor Richard M. Daley to award a grant of $250,000 to the CBHA for the purpose of constructing new single-family and "two-flat" homes in the Englewood district of Chicago, as part of an Enterprise Community Zone. The homes were to be constructed in the area "bounded by Princeton Avenue on the east, Stewart Avenue on the west, 61st Street on the south and 59th Place on the north. These were Community Development Block Grant funds, and were part of an effort to construct up to 50 homes. A dozen units were built before construction of new housing collapsed in 2008 due to the lending crisis caused by mortgage lending in the subprime markets.
Campaign 2008.
Some individuals made note during the campaign of the association between Democrat Presidential Candidate Barack Obama and the CBHA. This association is in dispute, despite the reporting from the "Chicago Sun-Times".

1999 Winchester 400

The thirtieth annual Winchester 400 motor race (run yearly since 1970) was held under Kendall Late Model Series sanction on September 26, 1999, at the Winchester Speedway, Indiana (USA).
After turning in a stellar performance the previous year, only to have suspension failure end his hopes of an initial "Winchester 400" victory. Brian Ross of Plymouth, Indiana, had everything go his way in the 1999 running of the 200-miler. This was the first running of the historic event under the sanction of the Kendall Late Model Series and was the first win by an Indiana-based driver since Vern Schrock won the fourth annual event in 1973.
The race.
Matt Hagans of Indianapolis, Indiana, started off the weekend by establishing a new track record for the series of 15.494 seconds (116.167 MPH). At the green, former Series Champion Brian Rievley jumped from his outside pole position starting spot to the lead, with Hagans, Kenny Tweedy, David Stremme, and Jim Crabtree Jr. in pursuit. Starting 18th in the 32-car field, B. Ross charged to sixth by lap 87.
The first round of pit stops occurred on lap 117 after Peter Cozzolino and Dave Jackson made contact, sending Cozzolino bouncing off the inside front-stretch wall. Ray Skillman elected to stay on the racetrack and was scored the leader, while Ross was forced to make two trips down pit lane and was shuffled to the last car on the lead lap. Skillman would stay out in front until stopping for service on lap 154, setting up a battle among Rievley, Hagans, and B. Ross for the race lead. Rievley and Hagans would trade the lead several times before Hagans suffered oil pump problems and retired.
This handed the lead to back to Rievley on lap 317. After a pair of top-five "400" finishes as a part-time All-Pro Series competitor, Rievley appeared headed for his first win when he suddenly slammed into the fourth turn wall on lap 379. Running a close second, B. Ross was able to avoid Rievley and assume the lead. On the restart, B. Ross was able to cruise home a lap ahead of younger brother Scott Ross who was a late-entry in what was originally the back-up car for the eventual winner. Jeff Fultz was third, six laps back of the leader with Chet Blanton fourth. David Ecoff was credited with fifth, 17 laps behind the leader as high-attrition marred the event. B. Ross collected $10,100 for the biggest win of his career.

Healthcare error proliferation model

The Healthcare Error Proliferation Model is an adaptation of James Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model designed to illustrate the complexity inherent in the contemporary healthcare delivery system and the attribution of human error within these systems. The Healthcare Error Proliferation Model explains the etiology of error and the sequence of events typically leading to adverse outcomes. This model emphasizes the role organizational and external cultures contribute to error identification, prevention, mitigation, and defense construction.
Introduction.
Healthcare systems are "complex" in that they are diverse in both structure (e.g. nursing units, pharmacies, emergency departments, operating rooms) and professional mix (e.g. nurses, physicians, pharmacists, administrators, therapists) and made up of multiple interconnected elements with "adaptive" tendencies in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. The term "complex adaptive systems" (CAS) was coined at the interdisciplinary Santa Fe Institute (SFI), by John H. Holland, and Murray Gell-Mann. Subsequently, scholars such as Ruth A. Anderson, Rubin McDaniels, and Paul Cilliers have extended CAS theory and research to the social sciences such as education and healthcare.
Model Overview.
The Healthcare Error Proliferation Model (HEPM) adapts the Swiss Cheese Model to the complexity of healthcare delivery systems and integrated organizations. The Swiss Cheese Model, likens the complex adaptive system to multiple hole infested slices of Swiss cheese positioned side-by-side. The cheese slices are dubbed defensive layers to describe their role and function as the system location outfitted with features capable of intercepting and deflecting hazards. The layers represent discrete locations or organizational levels potentially populated with errors permitting error progression. The four layers include: 1) organizational leadership, 2) risky supervision, 3) situations for unsafe practices, and 4) unsafe performance.
The HEPM portrays hospitals as having multiple operational defensive layers outfitted with essential elements necessary to maintain key defensive barricades (Cook & O'Connor, 2005; Reason, 2000). By examining the defensive layers attributes, prospective locales of failure, the etiology of accidents might be revealed (Leape et al., 1995). Experts have discussed the importance of examining these layers within the context of the complex adaptive healthcare system (Kohn et al., 2000; Wiegmann & Shappell, 2003) and considering the psychological safety of clinicians. Hence, this model expands Reason’s seminal work.
The model incorporates the complex adaptive healthcare system as a key characteristic. Complex adaptive systems characteristically demonstrate self-organization as diverse agents interact spontaneously in nonlinear relationships where professionals act as information processors (Cilliers, 1998; McDaniel & Driebe, 2001) and co-evolve with the environment (Casti, 1997). Healthcare professionals function in the system as diverse actors within the complex environment utilizing different methods to process information (Coleman, 1999) and solve systemic problems within and across organizational layers (McDaniel & Driebe, 2001).
Definitions.
A complex adaptive healthcare system (CAHS) is a care delivery enterprise with diverse clinical and administrative agents acting spontaneously, interacting in nonlinear networks where agents and patients are information processors, and actively co-evolve with their environment with the purposed to produce safe and reliable patient-centered outcomes.

Davis, Massachusetts

Davis, Massachusetts is the abandoned location of the "Davis Pyrite Mine". Once the largest iron pyrite-mine in Massachusetts, Davis grew to be a decent sized mining village at the beginnings of the Second Industrial Revolution (1870–1915). But, in 1911, a non-fatal collapse of the mine due to “poor mining practices” ended the nearly 30-year run. By 1937, the mining camp had faded, and all that remained were a blacksmith shop and about 150 cellar holes.
Location.
Davis is located at .
The abandoned mining village is located in the Town of Rowe, in Franklin County, about three miles north of Charlemont and two miles south-southeast of Rowe. The area is east of Davis Mine Road and west of Davis Mine Brook. Both Rowe (2000 pop - 351) and Charlemont (2000 pop - 1358) are picturesque small towns in the rolling hills of northwestern Massachusetts. Both communities have a long heritage. Rowe was established in 1762 and incorporated in 1785, and Charlemont was established in 1742 and incorporated in 1765.
Mining camp settlement.
It was in the wooded hills between the two towns that an iron pyrite outcrop was discovered and a mine developed by H.J. Davis around 1882. The eastern section of Rowe, called Davis, became the center of activity because of the profitable operation of Davis Sulfur Ore Mine for twenty-nine years. The Davis Mine supplied a major economic boost to both Rowe and Charlemont.
A good-sized mining camp developed at the site, which included a blacksmith shop, butcher shop, electric lighting, and at least 150 homes. There were four mining shafts, and a period photo of Shaft #1 shows a large enclosed headframe (shafthouse) tram and what appears to be a reduction works of some kind (smokestack and large building). It is said the mine produced about 100 tons of pyrite a day, and the iron sulfide was used to produce sulfuric acid, a commercially important chemical. Charlemont claims to be the first electrified town in Massachusetts, so it is possible that power was then run to the mining camp. The miners are said to have earned $12–15 per day (that claim has not been verified), which in those days was excellent pay.
Economic impact.
Until its 1911 cave-in, the Davis mine had become a mainstay of Rowe’s economy. It was a lucrative source of iron pyrite. Popularly known as "fool's gold", pyrite can be processed to yield substantial quantities of sulfide, which can in turn be used to manufacture sulfuric acid. (The mine also yielded smaller but, nevertheless, financially significant amounts of copper.) The pyrite deposit is located in mica and quartz schists, which includes the presence of chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Average sulfur content was reported to be 47 percent, and copper content about 1.5 percent.
By 1875, Charlemont's industrial base was limited to several sawmills, two scythe snathes (handles) shops and a chair making operation. With the opening and success of the Davis iron pyrite and talc mine in Rowe in the 1880s, a prospecting craze developed in the area. In 1892 the main shaft was 501 feet deep, and production was reported to be 334,552 tons of pyrite.
Mining operations were also opened in Charlemont during this period and included the Massachusetts Talc Company in the village of Zoar. The merchants of Charlemont Center benefited greatly from this prospecting craze. Two shops opened in the early 1890s, which were important to the Town's economy for a number of years. In 1891, W.M. Pratt established a rake handle factory and the following year, H.H. Frary opened a carriage shop, which also produced wooden spools for the silk mills in Northampton.
During its 29-year working life, the Davis Mine pumped thousands of tax dollars into the town’s coffers, and became a local tourist attraction as well. Visitors could climb an observation tower above the main shaft for a panoramic view of the bustling operation, which featured on-site blacksmith and butcher shops, a steady traffic of horse-drawn ore and coal wagons and the town’s first electric lighting. The annual payroll amounted to $100,000, and local farmers made extra income supplying the mine with timber and firewood, while selling fruit, vegetables and dairy products to the workers.
Today.
Little remains of the camp today. The area has several cellar holes of defunct houses, and second-growth forest has staked its claim to much of the land along these unpaved backroads.
However, the Davis Mine is a major study area as there are ecological concerns due to a pollution plume exuding from the old workings down into Davis Mine Creek. When the mine collapsed, groundwater seeped into the old workings, and now flows out and downhill into the creek. The University of Massachusetts Amherst has used this as a study site. The remains of the Davis Mine are on private property (it is posted), so access is not available. Other abandoned mines of the Davis Mine period in the Charlemont area within the Hawley "Mineral Belt" stratabound massive sulfide deposit are the Hawks or Mt. Peak Mine and the Mary Louise or Davenport Mine.
Pollution study.
Acid mine drainage (AMD), occurring at abandoned mines, is a water problem characterized by low pH and high levels of metals. An interdisciplinary research team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst is studying why the AMD from the abandoned sulfide mine is slowly cleaning itself over time. The group brings together experts from the fields of microbiology, geology, engineering, and science education, to determine the extent and rate of bioremediation.
According to professors in the study, the overflowing groundwater drains out of the old mine shafts, and flows down the stream channel. The drainage waters are more acidic than vinegar, with pH values around 2, and carry large loads of metals, including copper, zinc, and iron. In other areas of the country, similar acid-mine drainage from former coal or gold mines can mobilize additional undesirable contaminants. Researchers stress, however, that there is no threat to the local environment or the area's water supply, because the iron sulfide in the Davis mine contains few hazardous impurities. This makes the site an ideal subject for examining the natural processes that are contained in the drainage.
Researchers say their findings may enable quicker natural cleanups not just at the Davis mine, but at others throughout the country and the world. The project has received a $1.59-million grant from the "Biocomplexity in the Environment" program of the National Science Foundation.

Pennsylvania Wing Civil Air Patrol

The Pennsylvania Wing of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is the highest echelon of CAP in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Wing headquarters is located at Fort Indiantown Gap near Harrisburg, PA.
Pennsylvania Wing is abbreviated as "PAWG", and is often referred to by its members as "PA Wing". A Pennsylvania keystone is a symbol commonly used in patches and designs of PAWG.
For CAP radio communications, PAWG call signs have the "PennCAP" prefix. Pennsylvania Wing is the 31st wing, but equipment identification numbers and unit charter numbers begin with the prefix 37. For example, a CAP aircraft in Pennsylvania Wing uses the callsign "CAP 37##", where ## is the number of the aircraft.
History.
Pennsylvania Wing is one of the original 48 wings in Civil Air Patrol.
In the spring of 1942, the Pennsylvania Wing conducted a 30-day experiment with the intention of convincing the Army Air Forces that they were capable of flying cargo missions for the nation. PA Wing transported Army cargo as far as Georgia, and top Army officials were impressed. After the 30 day trial period, the War Department gave CAP permission to conduct courier and cargo service for the military, often flying mail, light cargo, and important military officials between USAAF bases.
One of the Civil Air Patrols very first "Aviation Cadet Programs" was established at the Pittsburgh Army Air Field in the Spring of 1943. Accepting young men as "Aviation Cadets" in a delayed enlistment program for the Army Air Forces, the Pittsburgh Squadron trained these boys (as young as 15) in Aerospace and Military subjects and vetted them for service as Army Air Force Pilots. Graduating a total of 16 Aviation Cadets for the Army in less than ten months, the Pittsburgh Squadron model was copied by units in Philadelphia, New York City and as far south as Florida. Today, the current Squadron with direct lineage to that Aviation Cadet Unit is the CAP's second longest, continually operated unit on a Military Installation.
On December 31, 1999, PA Wing units were put on stand-by in case of any problems arising from the Y2K bug.
During the September 11 attacks, Pennsylvania Wing was ordered to a stand-by state. Although not officially tasked with any missions in direct support, PAWG radio communications centers were operational and prepared to offer assistance.
In 2006, PA Wing was activated to fly reconnaissance missions during the 2006 flood. PAWG aircraft flew over major waterways to provide detailed photographs of flood-affected areas and to monitor floodwaters as they moved downstream.
31 Members from Pennsylvania Wing Civil Air Patrol traveled 28 hours to Pascagoula, Mississippi to aid in Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. PAWG Rangers went door-to-door ensuring that local residents had adequate food, water, and medical care.
In August and September 2011, all CAP emergency service teams in Pennsylvania Wing and CAP members from Maryland,West Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana Wings were activated to assist communities affected by Hurricane Irene (2011) and Tropical Storm Lee (2011).
During the time between September 1, 2010 to December 1, 2011, the Pennsylvania Wing saved eleven lives, provided emergency response in Pennsylvania during the 2011 flooding and severe winter storms.
In November 2012, CAP Pennsylvania Wing emergency services air crews and ground teams were activated to assist communities in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware during flooding and high wind of Hurricane Sandy.

Structure.
Pennsylvania Wing is the highest echelon of Civil Air Patrol in Pennsylvania. PA Wing reports to Northeast Region CAP, who reports to CAP National Headquarters.
Pennsylvania Wing Headquarters is located in a renovated World War Two Post Exchange (PX) and Non Commissioned Officers Club (NCO Club) at Fort Indiantown Gap in Annville, Pennsylvania. Offices, classrooms, a communications center and an emergency operations center are located inside the Headquarters. Additionally, the headquarters building is located approximately one mile from Muir Army Airfield.
Reporting to the Wing level, Pennsylvania is divided into six geographic groups and one School Group (Group 800). Each group conducts training, activities, classroom learning and programs, with actual missions assigned to a group from the Wing. Originally, the state was divided into three groups (western, central, and eastern); but with an increasing number of squadrons, PAWG divided split each group into northern and southern sections, creating six groups in 2007.
Reporting to each group are 76 squadrons. Squadrons are the local level of organization and serve the local community, and squadrons meet weekly to conduct conducts training, activities, classroom learning and programs to carry out the three missions of Civil Air Patrol - Emergency Services, Cadet Programs, and Aerospace Education.
There are three types of Civil Air Patrol squadrons.
As of December 1, 2011, the PA Wing operates 76 squadrons, in seven groups, 15 aircraft, 43 ground vehicles and a state-wide radio communications network that is operational 24/7 and is part of a national network.
Groups and Squadrons.
Group 1.
Group 1 is responsible for operations in and around the Pittsburgh area.
Group 2.
Group 2 operates around Harrisburg.
Group 3.
Group 3 operates in the greater Philadelphia area.
Group 4.
Group 4 conducts operations in the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area.
Group 5.
The Group 5 region encompasses much of North Central Pennsylvania, including State College, Altoona, and Williamsport.
Group 6.
Group 6 is responsible for operations near Erie.
Schools.
Pennsylvania Wing conducts a number of schools as a part of its cadet programs. These schools provide instruction and hands on experience to members in a variety of areas, ranging from aviation to search and rescue.
Hawk Mountain Ranger School.
Pennsylvania Wing operates the longest continuously operating school of search and rescue in the United States. Hawk Mountain Ranger School is funded and operated by the Wing both as a cadet program and also to instruct CAP members in emergency services operations. HMRS typically conducts training once a month, and offers a 10-day course during the summer as a National Cadet Special Activity.
Summer Schools.
Often referred to only as 'Encampment,' this school is a 9 day condensed version of the Air Force's Basic Training program, modified for cadets age 12-17. The encampment teaches basic cadets the fundamentals of followership and discipline in both an academic and applied environment. This course is traditionally taught at Fort Indiantown Gap.
CLS is also a 9 day course, offered a few weeks before basic encampment. CLS is similar to Air Force ROTC's Field Training program, focusing on developing cadet's leadership potential. This course involves both classroom instruction and applied leadership skills.
Glider Flight Encampment instructs cadets in the principles of flight, culminating in several rides in an unpowered glider.
Powered Flight Encampment instructs cadets in the basics of aviation. Cadets learn about ground and air procedures, as well as fly in CAP owned Cessna 172s and 182s. Cadets that do well during the program may earn their solo wings.
Other Schools.
BCOP is a weekend course to teach new cadets about the fundamentals of Civil Air Patrol. Topics covered include uniform care, basic drill instruction, opportunities available to cadets, as well as fun and fellowship. This course is typically offered in the early spring.
Squadrons are the local unit of Civil Air Patrol, and this course covers material related to the successful operation of a Civil Air Patrol squadron.

Business Information Services Library

Business Information Services Library (BiSL), previously known as Business Information Service Management Library, is a framework used for information management.
BiSL is a public domain standard since 2005, governed by the ASL BiSL foundation (previously ASL Foundation). The framework describes a standard for processes within business information management at the strategy, management and operations level. BiSL is closely related to the ITIL and ASL framework, yet the main difference between these frameworks is that ITIL and ASL focus on the supply side of information (the purpose of an IT organisation), whereas BiSL focuses on the demand side (arising from the end-user organisation).
History.
BiSL was originally developed in the Netherlands by RCC/Roccade Atribit. It was first described by Deurloo c.s. in an article "Model voor Functioneel Beheer", in the Dutch annual 'IT Beheer Jaarboek', edition 1998, pages 131-140 (ed. J. van Bon, Ten Hagen & Stam Uitgevers). 
Later, it was adopted by the ASL-BiSL Foundation, founded in 2002. The body of knowledge on BiSl is currently public domain.

From their inception in 1884 through their last year in Brooklyn, 1957, the Brooklyn Dodgers (also known as the Trolley Dodgers, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas, and Robins at various times in their history) used 41 different starting pitchers on Opening Day. Brickyard Kennedy made the most Opening Day starts for the Brooklyn Dodgers, with 6 such starts between 1894 and 1900. Nap Rucker made 5 such starts between 1907 and 1913. Carl Erskine made 4 Opening Day starts between 1951 and 1955 and Van Mungo also made 4 Opening Day starts between 1934 and 1938. Five Brooklyn pitchers made 3 Opening Day starts: Leon Cadore, Watty Clark, Don Newcombe, Jesse Petty, Dutch Ruether. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.
The Dodgers played in the modern World Series nine times before moving to Los Angeles, winning once in 1955, when Carl Esrkine was the Opening Day pitcher. Erskine was also the Opening Day pitcher in 1953 when they played in the World Series but lost to the New York Yankees. Joe Hatten also had two Opening Day starts in World Series years, 1947 and 1949. Other Opening Day starting pitchers in World Series years were Larry Cheney in 1916, Leon Cadore in 1920, Whit Wyatt in 1941, Preacher Roe in 1952, and Don Newcombe in 1956. 
Prior to the existence of the modern World Series, the Dodgers won National League championships in 1890, 1899 and 1900. They also won an American Association championship in 1889, when the American Association was considered a Major League. They played in the 19th century version of the World Series in 1889 and 1890. Mickey Hughes was the Opening Day starting pitcher in 1889, Bob Caruthers was the Opening Day starting pitcehr in 1890, and Kennedy was the Opening Day starting pitcher in 1899 and 1900.
Don Newcombe was the starting pitcher in 1956, the last Opening Day that the Dodgers played in their longtime home field, Ebbets Field. Newcombe was also the Opening Day starter on Opening Day of the 1957 season, the Dodgers last Opening Day before moving to Los Angeles. Nap Rucker was the Opening Day starting pitcher in the last Opening Day the team (then called the Trolley Dodgers) played at their previous home park, Washington Park, in 1912. Rucker was also the Opening Day pitcher in the first game at Ebbets Field in 1913.
Joe Hatten was the Opening Day starting pitcher in one of the most momentous games in baseball history. That was in 1947, the years of Jackie Robinson's first game in the Major Leagues, ending the racial segregation that had prevailed in Major League Baseball since before 1900. The Joe Hatten started and the Dodgers won Jackie Robinson's first major league game, beating the Boston Braves 5-3 at Ebbets Field.

A Foot in Coldwater

A Foot in Coldwater is a Canadian rock band composed of Alex Machin (vocals), Bob Horne (keyboard), Paul Naumann (guitar), Danny Taylor (drums), and Hughie Leggat (bass and vocals). They are best known for the song "(Make Me Do) Anything You Want" which was a Canadian hit single in 1972 and again in 1974.
History.
A Foot in Coldwater was formed in Toronto in 1970 from three bands. Leggat, Taylor, and Horne had been members of Nucleus, and the Lords of London. Machin and Naumann were in the band Island. Together, they signed with Frank Davies of Daffodil Records, who coined the group's name.
The band's first album, "A Foot in Coldwater", was released in 1972 with their first single "(Make Me Do) Anything You Want" which reached the top 25 on the Canadian charts. In 1973, they released their second album "The Second Foot in Coldwater" which included moderately successful singles "(Isn’t Love Unkind) In My Life" (#34) and "Love is Coming" (#27). In 1974, the band released a third album, "All Around Us", which included a shorter version of "(Make Me Do) Anything You Want" which again made the Canadian singles chart. The song was later covered by the heavy metal band Helix in 1984. It is described as "a sleepy ballad" by AllMusic. 
The band released one more single, "Midnight Lady" before Daffodil Records filed for bankruptcy in 1975, leaving them without a label. Horne left the group and the remaining members recorded a single, "Breaking Through" for Anthem in 1977, but it was not a success and the band folded.
The following year, Hughie Leggat teamed up with his brother Gordon and assembled a new band, calling themselves Private Eye. Their eponymous debut album was released in 1979 and featured the hit 'Your Place or Mine' (#51). The album peaked at No. 59. In early 1980, a second single "Changes" reached No. 93. With a lack of support from their label, the band called it quits in 1981 and the Leggat brothers, along with Rob Sagar, Phil Sullivan and Danny Taylor, formed a new project called Leggat. This union produced one album, "Illuminations" which was released in 1982. The song "White Flags" received airplay but the album was generally poorly received due to the length of the songs (most were over 4 minutes). White Flags was covered by Blue Öyster Cult in 1986.
A Foot in Coldwater regrouped in 1988 for short tours, and in 1998 Unidisc reissued their first three albums plus a two-disc compilation "The Very Best of a Foot in Coldwater".

Sam Rohrer

Samuel E. "Sam" Rohrer (born August 11, 1955) is an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 128th District. 
Before entering politics, Rohrer managed a radio station and worked in marketing for Graco. In 2010, he ran for Governor of Pennsylvania, losing in the primary election to Tom Corbett. Rohrer ran for the United States Senate in 2012 to challenge incumbent Democratic incumbent Bob Casey, Jr., but was defeated in the primary by Tom Smith. He is currently president of the Pennsylvania Pastors' Network, a branch of Let Freedom Ring, Inc.
Early life, education, and radio career.
Rohrer was born in Dover, Ohio, and is an alumnus of Tuscarawas Valley High School. After earning a degree in Business Administration from Bob Jones University in 1977, he managed a radio station for several years before becoming director of marketing for Graco, based in Elverson, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
Elections.
Rohrer was elected to the State House in November 1992, succeeding retiring Republican Jim Gallen. He typically won re-election with over 60% of the vote. However, he faced difficult contests in his last two elections. In 2006, he defeated Democrat Russell Hummel 55%-45%. In 2008, he defeated Democrat John Woodward 52%-48%.
Tenure.
He introduced legislation that would eliminate school property taxes in Pennsylvania. He was a strong opponent of the REAL ID Act. He authored the historic Education Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) scholarship. Today over 150,000 students have earned the scholarship to go to private schools.
2010 gubernatorial campaign.
In November 2009, Rohrer announced that he would not seek re-election to the State House, and would instead seek the Republican nomination for governor. His campaign team, which was headed by Jeff Coleman, a former colleague of Rohrer's in the State House, received praise for its innovative and effective use of technology, including social media. Rohrer's primary opponent, State Attorney General Tom Corbett, was endorsed by the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania on February 13, 2010, but that endorsement also generated support for Rohrer from members of the Tea Party movement. Rohrer and his supporters organized a day-long rally entitled "Mobilize for Liberty", which included seminars and a speech from Rohrer, that took place down the hall from the main ballroom in which the State Committee was announcing its endorsement of Corbett. Following its endorsement of Corbett, the State Committee sent-out mailers attacking Rohrer's vote in favor of the 2005 legislative pay raise, as well as his 2001 vote in favor of a plan to increase lawmaker pensions by upwards of 50 percent.
Ultimately, Corbett defeated Rohrer 69%-31%. Rohrer only won two counties in the state: Lancaster County (52%) and Berks County (80%). He nearly won Clinton and Lycoming Counties During the following summer, supporters initiated a write-in campaign for the November election. Rohrer did not endorse nor denounce the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.
Between campaigns.
In February 2011 Rohrer became Pennsylvania state director for Americans for Prosperity. Rohrer resigned from the position in November, in preparation for a run for the United States Senate.
2012 U.S. Senate election.
On Friday, November 4, 2011, Jeff Coleman, who again signed-on to advise Rohrer's campaign, told the Associated Press that Rohrer was considering a run for the United States Senate seat currently held by Democrat Bob Casey Jr., and would likely officially announce his candidacy later in the month. Rohrer officially announced his candidacy at rally near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on November 21. He also released a web video announcing his entrance to the race.
A poll taken shortly after his entrance into the race found Rohrer ahead of the rest of the primary field, besting his closest competitor by ten percentage points. In a Pittsburgh Tribune Review/WPXI-TV poll taken February 2–6, 2012, Rohrer continued to lead his opponents, albeit by a slighter margin; businessman Tom Smith had the support of 8% of those polled to Rohrer's 10%. A later poll conducted by Franklin & Marshall College on March 20–25 placed Rohrer slightly behind Smith, with 7% and 9% support, respectively, with 81% of those surveyed remaining undecided.
Rohrer was endorsed by former 2012 Presidential candidates Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain.
Rohrer was defeated in the primary by fellow Republican Tom Smith on April 24, 2012.
Personal life.
Rohrer and his wife, Ruth Ann, have six children and five grandchildren. He currently serves as president of the Pennsylvania Pastors' Network, a branch of Let Freedom Ring, Inc. that informs clergy on issues pertaining to public policy. On March 21, 2013 he was awarded "Alumnus of the Year" at the annual Bob Jones University Bible Conference.

The Absence of War is a play by English playwright, David Hare, the final installment of his trilogy about contemporary Britain. The play premiered in 1993 at the Royal National Theatre, London, England.
The play is based on his behind the scenes observations of the Labour Party leadership during their unsuccessful General Election campaign of the previous year. 
The central character, party leader George Jones, is so smothered and constricted by his cautious advisers that eventually none of the great talents that brought him to prominence are visible to the public.

Westbrook Church

Westbrook Church is a non-denominational, Evangelical Christian church located in Hartland, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee. The church is autonomous and independent of any denominational control. Westbrook is a member of the Willow Creek Association.
History.
The Westbrook story began with several small neighborhood groups of people who attended Elmbrook Church in Brookfield. In 1981 worship services were held on Sunday evenings at Cushing School in Delafield with average attendance between 25-30 people. In 1982 slow growth had leaders set to hold Westbrook’s final service due to low attendance. However, seventy-five people who wanted to know when the church would be started showed up, saving the church. In 1983 Westbrook was officially born as a church plant of Elmbrook and worship services were held at Delafield Town Hall. Also that year, International Ministries was founded with the mission “to know Christ and to make Him known”. In 1985 Westbrook started meeting at the Walmart Center strip mall in Delafield and began supporting their first four missionary families. In 1986 the church supported eight missionary families. 
In 1988 the church purchased the cornfield in Hartland where the church is currently located and added an associate pastor. In 1989 growth led to a second worship service being added, services moved once again to Wales Elementary School, and Westbrook hired its first youth pastor. In 1993 Westbrook broke ground on Phase I of its new campus and temporarily moved yet again to Kettle Moraine High School. In 1994 Phase I was completed and the church moved into its first permanent building, with worship services held in the gym. By 1996 the congregation had doubled in size since moving into the new facility. In 1999 plans began for adding a worship center and additional classrooms. In 2002 the debt on Phase I was retired allowing construction to be planned for Phase II. In 2005 Phase II was completed, consisting of a state-of-the-art 1,000 seat worship center. In 2008, California native Scott Grabendike became the new lead pastor of Westbrook. The church celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2008.

Giovanni Buscaglione

Giovanni Buscaglione (March 1, 1874 - 1941) was an Italian - Colombian architect and priest from Piedmont, Italy. He designed series of important projects of religious and educative architecture in Italy, Constantinople, Izmir and Alexandria but was especially noted for his work in Colombia, a country where he spent his later years and contributed a significant number of architectural works.
Biography.
Buscaglione spent two years of his childhood with San Juan Bosco, one of the great educators of the 19th century and founder of the congregations of San Francisco de Sales and of the Daughters of Helping Maria, both dedicated to the education and development of poor young people. Then, he studied electronic engineering in the Albertina Academy of Turin, and developed an interest in sketching ecclesiastical architecture with father Ernesto Vespignani, designer of several churches and schools in South America and he soon had a number of schools in Egypt and Turkey in which he would design in Istanbul and Alexandria. He was soon under contract to undertake architectural work in Colombia, and arrived at Bogota, the Colombian capital in 1920. Soon after his arrival he became co-assistant and first director of the office of engineering, and was appointed in that same year at the Colegio Salesiano.
Through this office, he was permitted to work as a priest and design a wide variety of religious buildings and schools in Colombia over a period of twenty years, until his death in 1941. He conducted surveys for reforms, constructing chapels, sanctuaries, seminaries, convents, agricultural farms, schools and even devised a project for a university in Medellín. He designed buildings across many departments of Colombia including Amazonas, Antioquia, Bolívar, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, Meta, Santander and Valle del Cauca.
He also focused in the education of young people from underprivileged backgrounds, carrying on the work in the country, which he had been involved in back in Italy and had once been taught under. The primary objective was to provide to religious, technical and artistic education to Colombian boys in the Schools of Arts and he was responsible for training capable workers in graphical arts, carpentry, mechanics and construction of buildings. Buscaglione was able to provide his personal knowledge towards architectural education and taught the constructive details, the structural calculations and measurements red and how to create molds for the casting of columns, arcs, and decorative bricks.
Buscaglione's architectural style in Colombia was a stylistic expression influenced by his Italian roots but also incorporated styles of Islamic architecture in the near east which he had become fond of during his time in Turkey and Egypt in Izmir, Istanbul and Alexandria. This was reflected in his works such as the Greater Seminary of Medellín (1919–1928) – today a commercial center, the Colegio de León XIII (1922–1938) and the Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora del Carmen (1926–1938) in Bogota, considered his masterpiece. The Florentine Gothic style was prevalent in his work, and he was under contract to construct more than thirty churches and chapels under the national reformation programme during which the Metropolitan Cathedral of Medellín was completed. The tower rises 57 meters above the vestibule, characterised by its ornate white facade. It was declared National Monument of Colombia in 1993
Buscaglione died in 1941.

Société Centrale Canine

The Société centrale canine (translates to Central Canine Society) or SCC was founded in 1881 and is made up of regional clubs and breed clubs, and coordinates and regulates activities and connections between governmental groups and dog clubs, as well as activities through the Fédération cynologique internationale.
History.
The SCC was founded in 1881, to sponsor dog shows in France as The Kennel Club was doing in England.
In 1885, the Book of French Origin ("Livre des origines français", L.O.F.) for the preservation of native dog breeds was begun through the SCC. In 1957, the French Ministry of Agriculture recognised the L.O.F. with other animal records, and it became the official French listing for purebred dogs. Today, all purebred dogs are listed in this register, subject to checking and restrictions. The parent dogs must be certified for breeding, and the puppy certified by inspection of an SCC judge between 10 and 15 months of age. French legal code allows only L.O.F. certified and registered dogs to be sold as purebred. Stud books for specific breeds within the L.O.F. may be either open or closed, and there is a mechanism for recognising dogs with unregistered parents, by visual inspection. After three generations (number of generations set by law) the descendants are registered without additional separate inspections.
Organization.
The SCC has a President with four vice-presidents, a secretary-general and adjunct, and a treasurer and adjunct. There is a 26 member committee, made up of representatives from regional kennel clubs, breed clubs, and dog activity clubs. Reporting to the committee is a general assembly from all of the regional and specialty clubs, with one member for every 50 to 300 members of the club being represented.
In addition, there are commissions for education, scientific research, judges' training and the L.O.F., shows, and many other topics of interest to dog fanciers.

Fran Florez (born in Bakersfield, California) is an American politician from California and a member of the Democratic party. 
She is also the mother of Democratic State Senator Dean Florez, who has represented the area (which includes Fresno, Tulare, Kern and Kings counties) in the legislature since 1998.
Florez is a past member and president of the Shafter Chamber of Commerce. She won election to the Shafter City Council in 1996 and has served there everl since; she currently serves as Mayor. 
Since 2002, she has also been a member of the California High Speed Rail Authority, serving as chairman in 2005.
In 2008, she was the Democratic nominee for the 30th District in the California State Assembly. The incumbent, Democrat Nicole Parra, had been feuding with her son, Dean Florez, for years and consequently endorsed Fran Florez' Republican opponent, former Assistant CHP Chief Danny Gilmore. In a mild surprise, she narrowly lost to Gilmore in the Democratic-leaning district [http://www.kmph.com/Global/story.asp?S=9298839].
In June 2010, Florez won the Democratic primary in the 30th Assembly District against Nicole Parra's father, Pete Parra. She faced Republican farmer David Valadao in the November general election. Valadao soundly defeated her by a 61% to 39% margin.

Xerula megalospora

Xerula megalospora is a species of gilled mushroom in the Physalacriaceae family.
"Xerula megalospora" fruit bodies occur on the ground, solitarily or in small groups. They are saprobic and found near the well-decayed stumps of oak or other broadleaf trees. This species can grow up to high. The caps, across, can be a convex or umbonate shape eventually becoming flat and centrally depressed. The cap is viscid and colored smokey white to pale buff. Gills are adnate, white, and smooth. The flesh of "Xerula megalospora" is white, and the odor is sometimes described as being reminiscent of carrots. The stipe contains a root-like extension long. The spore print is white. The spores of this species are a distinguishing feature being a relatively large 18–23 by 11–14 μm. The botanical name "megalospora" means large-spored. The spore shape is citriniform (i.e., lemon shaped), the surface is finely roughened, and spores are non-amyloid. This species is widespread and fairly common in urban areas.

Baudouin des Auteus

Baudouin des Auteus () was a Picard trouvère of the early thirteenth century, probably from Autheux near Doullens. Unfortunately, "the two works attributed to him are both of disputed authorship."
The song "M'ame et mon cors doing a celi" is recorded with two different melodies, one in the manuscript tradition of BnF F-Pa 5198 and another in the Chansonnier du Roi and Noailles Chansonnier. The latter melody is non-repetitive, while the poem is isometric. The other song ascribed by some manuscripts to Baudouin is "Avril ne mai, froidure ne let tans". It too is isometric, decasyllabic, and having eight-line stanzas. Though it is also attributed to Gace Brulé, the attribution to Baudouin is more likely. 
It was once suggested that Baudouin des Auteus was the same Baudouin that participated in some "jeux partis" with Theobald I of Navarre, but this is dubious.

Scotland won 9-5, and prevented Wales from winning the Grand Slam. After accepting a gold watch as part of Newport's invincible 1922/23 season, the Scottish Rugby Union suspended McPherson for what they saw as an act of professionalism; but he was later re-instated. McPherson's last game for Scotland was against Ireland, but was chosen to join the British Lions 1924 tour of South Africa, when he played in all four tests against the Springboks.

Stephens Lyne-Stephens (4 October 1801 – 28 February 1860) was an English Tory politician who represented Barnstaple before the 1832 Reform Act. After inheriting a family fortune from glass manufacture in Portugal, he was later reputed to be the richest commoner in England.
Lyne-Stephens was returned as Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1830. His father had paid over £5000 for his election which was in support of political reform. On 15 November 1830, Stephens was one of a group of right wing Tories who voted against the government and ended the rule of the Duke of Wellington. Following the political excitement that led to the 1831 Reform Election, Stephens decided not to defend his seat. He concentrated his activities on hunting and shooting. In 1832 he was invited to stand for Liskeard but withdrew his name at the last minute. He moved to Melton Mowbray which he considered excellent hunting and riding country.
In 1837 Stephens married French ballerina Yolande Duvernay. He bought Lynford Hall near Thetford in 1856, intending to develop its with mansion house, parkland and lake as a hunting retreat, and commissioned the architect William Burn to refurbish it. He was High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1858.
His death in 1860 set off a frenzy of fortune hunters, who went so far as to tamper with their family trees in order to bolster their claims to the estate. The fortune had been amassed by William Stephens of Cornwall, an illegitimate child born in 1731. He started a glass factory in Portugal with his brother and members of the related Lyne family. Stephens had influential political connections in Portugal, exempting his business from taxes.

Sussex Scot

The Sussex Scot was one of a number of Named Trains introduced by the British Rail InterCity (British Rail) sector during the 1980s. The train ran between Brighton and Glasgow Central / Edinburgh Waverley via Kensington Olympia, Reading, Birmingham New Street and major stations on the West Coast Main Line to Carstairs where the train divided into portions for Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley.
There had been a direct train service between Brighton and Manchester Piccadilly since 14 May 1979. The first departure of the Sussex Scot was 16 May 1988. The northbound train departed Brighton at 1315 and arrived at Glasgow Central 2248 and Edinburgh Waverley 2252. Southbound the train departed Glasgow Central 1050 and Edinburgh Waverley 1044 and arrived at Brighton 2020. The train was normally formed of 10 coaches. A class 47 locomotive hauled the train between Brighton and Birmingham New Street and vice versa with usually a class 86 or class 87 electric locomotive between Birmingham New Street and Scotland.
From the 15th May 1989 the departure time from Brighton was moved to the more convenient time of 0845 arriving in Glasgow Central at 1732 and Edinburgh Waverley at 1747. This is when the train acquired its 1S76 headcode.
From 14 May 1990 the departure time from Brighton was moved again to 0918 with an arrival time in Glasgow Central at 1810. The Edinburgh portion no longer ran. Southbound departure from Glasgow Central was 1133 with an arrival in Brighton at 2021. Over the following years the destination swapped between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley but the times remained largely unaltered.
The next major change was for the summer 1994 timetable. From 16 May 1994 both north and southbound trains also served Manchester Piccadilly Departure from Brighton was at 0920 arriving at Manchester Piccadilly at 1522 and at Glasgow Central 1912. Southbound the Sussex Scot departed Glasgow Central at 1040, Manchester Piccadilly at 1417 and arrived at Brighton 2028. The locomotive change from diesel to electric was now done at Preston. By this date the formation of the train had been reduced to 7 coaches. There was little change over the following years even when Virgin Trains won the franchise for the CrossCountry rail network in 1997. 
New Voyager trains were introduced on the service from 2001. The introduction of Virgin Trains Operation Princess saw the last run of the Sussex Scot on 28 September 2002, after that date services from Brighton whilst increased in number went no further than Manchester Piccadilly.

<doc id="19561408" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19561408" title="Steam brake">
Steam brake

A steam brake is a type of brake for steam locomotives and their tenders, whereby a steam cylinder works directly on the brake linkages. 
Steam brakes were primarily used on railways where vacuum brakes were used to brake the train, but where there was no vacuum brake on the steam locomotive itself, as for example in the United Kingdom, or where there was only a cable-operated brake (e.g. a Heberlein brake) running along the train, like for example in Saxony on the narrow gauge railways. 
Steam brakes are usually found today on heritage steam locomotives.
Operation.
Steam is supplied to the steam brake cylinders from the locomotive boiler via a valve (the brake valve) which may have several fixed settings or be infinitely variable. The piston in the steam cylinder is set in motion by the steam admitted, the piston rod transfers the brake force via a system of rods to the brake blocks of the vehicle, thus achieving the braking effect. A return spring returns the piston to its rest position as soon as the steam supply is interrupted. The expanded and condensed steam is drained from the steam cylinder through a drain valve ("Entwässerungsventil").
Direct steam brake.
A steam brake acts directly and immediately; the sudden opening of the brake valve can result in a slight overbraking by locking the wheels. The operation of a steam brake therefore requires a great deal of experience from the engine driver. 
Vacuum controlled steam brake.
A steam brake can be operated directly by a lever (valve) and also indirectly together with the vacuum brake. In the latter case, a control valve linked to the vacuum system controls the admission of steam to the brake cylinder, so that the steam brake can be activated automatically in an emergency or if the train separates (the so-called 'automatic steam brake').

Phiten

Phiten is a Japanese company producing apparel, athletic tape, supports and braces, lotions and gels, necklaces and bracelets, health food, and other wellness-related products. Phiten also produces hair-care products under its beauty division, Yuko. All Phiten products are incorporated with one or more "Aqua Metals". The name "Phi-Ten" is derived from the Greek letter "Phi" Φ, and the exponent 10.
Phiten operates over 100 retail store locations across Japan. As of 2009 the company has affiliates in the USA, Korea, China, Germany, and the UK. Phiten has distributors in over 20 countries including Canada, Mexico, France, and Russia.
Some Major League Baseball players wear the company's nylon-coated necklaces, although it is not known whether it is for "physiological benefits, superstition or a combination of both.". Many view the products as mere superstition and ritual.
Company background.
The company was founded in October 1983 by Yoshihiro Hirata in Japan with its corporate headquarters in Kyoto. After an illness curtailed his training as a chef, Hirata studied physical therapy and rehabilitation methods on his own. At the age of 29 he started a physical therapy center, and later developed titanium-infused tape.
In 2007, Phiten became the first Japanese company to acquire a license for an "MLB Authentic Collection". In 2008, Phiten acquired a license for the NBA and in 2011, Phiten acquired a license for the NHL.
As of 2013, Phiten has acquired over 100 patents worldwide.
Product information.
Through a proprietary manufacturing process, metals, such as titanium, gold and silver are turned into "Aqua Metals" such as Aqua Titanium, Aqua Gold and Aqua Silver which are then incorporated into Phiten products. Aqua metals are created through a proprietary process that breaks down metals into microscopic particles dispersed in water, creating a hydro-colloidal metal. Every Phiten product features this technology.

Stan Burton

Stanley "Stan" "Dizzie" Burton (3 December 1912 – 1977) was an English footballer, who played mainly for Doncaster Rovers, and appeared in the 1939 FA Cup Final for Wolverhampton Wanderers.
He was partially deaf, and so did not play to the whistle. His nickname of "Dizzie" was due to him continuing runs after the referee had blown.
Career.
Burton began his career at Thurnscoe Victoria, moving to Doncaster Rovers in March 1933, where he immediately commanded a first team place on the right wing. He went on to have over 5 seasons of success at the club, including winning the Third Division North in 1934–35 and being runners-up in 1937–38. His goal scoring reached double figures in each of the three seasons from 1933–36, with a hat−trick in a 2–3 win at Hull City on 19 October 1935.
A few games into the 1938–39 season, Burton moved to First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his Wolves debut on 10 September 1938 in a 1–0 win at Brentford and made 32 appearances and scored 4 goals during the season which saw them reach the FA Cup Final. Burton played in the Wembley showpiece where they lost to underdogs Portsmouth.
This turned out to be his only season at Molineux though, as he headed south to join West Ham United in the Second Division. Burton signed for West Ham only five days after his Wembley appearance for Wolves. In doing so he became the first player to appear in an FA Cup Final and play for another club before the end of the season. He made his debut in the last game of the season and then played in all three of West Hams games the following season before competitive football was suspended due to the Second World War.
Moving back north, he did play as a guest in the Wartime Leagues for several clubs. Beginning with Doncaster, he played in 60 games scoring 11 times between 1939 and the 1941–42 season. He played once for Barnsley in 1941–42, and three times the following season. His one game with Leeds United was in the last fixture of the 1941–42 Football League Northern Section (Second Championship). In season 1942–43 he played 23 matches, scoring 8 times, with Chesterfield, and then in 1943–44 he made three appearances for Sheffield Wednesday. 1944–45 saw him with Bradford City where he got one goal in 14 matches.
After end of the war, Burton played for Midland League side Peterborough United for a single season, 1947–48 as well as non-League club Frickley Colliery.
He died in 1977 in Sheffield.

Sigebert Buckley

Sigebert Buckley (b. c. 1520 AD; d. probably 1610) was a Benedictine monk in England, who is regarded by the Benedictines and by Ampleforth College in particular as representing the continuity of the community through the English Reformation.
Although the English Benedictines had been dissolved by Henry VIII in the 1530s, one solitary monastery was re-established in Westminster Abbey by the Roman Catholic Queen, Mary I of England 20 years later. After only a few years, her half-sister Queen Elizabeth I dissolved this monastery again. By 1607 only one of the Westminster monks was left alive: Father Sigebert Buckley. 
Buckley survived until the reign of James I, by which time a number of Englishmen had become Benedictines in the monasteries of Italy and Spain, and had obtained a faculty from Pope Clement VIII (in 1602) to take part with the secular clergy and the Jesuits in the English mission. It was through the efforts of the English monks of the Cassinese or Italian Congregation that Buckley became instrumental in preserving monastic continuity in England. It is through Buckley that the English Benedictine Congregation lays claim to an unbroken continuity with the pre-Reformation monasticism of England.
Ampleforth College, the largest Roman Catholic boarding school in England, was opened in 1802 and is run by the Benedictine monks of Ampleforth Abbey, which traces its history through Buckley.
Buckley's statement.
I, D. Sebert, otherwise Sigebert, priest and monk of the monastery of St. Peter, Westminster, of the Congregation of England of the Order of St. Benedict: lest the rights, privileges, insignia, should perish which were formerly granted by Princes and Pontiffs and which for some years, God so permitting, have been preserved in me the sole survivor of all the English monks: did at London in the year 1607, the 21st day of November, with the consent of their superiors receive and admit as brethren and monks of the said monastery D. Robert Sadler of Peterborough and D. Edward Maihew of Salisbury, English priests and monks professed of the Cassinese Congregation of St. Justina of Padua: and to them did grant, impart and assign all rights, privileges, ranks, honours, liberties and graces which in times past the monks professed and dwelling in the said monastery did enjoy.
And the same by these presents I do again approve, ratify and confirm. And I do receive and admit as monks, brethren, lay-brethren, oblates of the said monastery  and to them do grant, impart and assign all rights, privileges, as above, all those whom D. Thomas Preston of Shropshire, D. Augustine and D. Anselm [Beech Lancastrians, and D. Maurus of Ely have admitted or received as monks, lay-brethren, oblates, and to whom they have granted the rights, &c, as above: since to them I did grant authority and power so to admit, &c, as appeareth more at large in my letters of the 21st November 1607: the which [letters as to all and each of their parts I do by virtue of these presents hold ratified and confirmed, and will so hold them in perpetuum. Given at Punisholt, otherwise Ponshelt, Anno Domini 1609, the 8th day of November, in the presence of the underwritten Notary and witnesses".

Charles Richards (NASA engineer)

Designer engineer Charles Richard used data from NASA research over Francis Rogallo's mechanical inventions to produce a wing configuration for manned hung-pilot kite-gliders that was to be found copied only with slight ornamental variation in a decade of hang gliders. Richards was of the Flight Research Center's Vehicle and System Dynamics Branch. The four-beamed wing folded from the noseplate; one of the beams was the spreader beam that kept the flexible-wing's sweep. Those in the following decade copying the Charles Richard wing configuration expanded kiting, hang gliding, ultralight, and trike flight.
Clarification of terms.
To follow the literature surrounding the constructions by Charles Richard and his team member engineers, a distinction of terms is useful, as use of some of the terms have changed over the decades later. Here are the terms that may confuse one studying the contributions of Charles Richard: kite, manned kite, glider, kite-glider, parawing, paraglider (as then used opposed to how the term is used in 2008), Rogallo wing, lobe, flexible wing, fully limp wing, inflatable wing, and hang glider (traditional expansive use vs specialized uses). The terms are sometimes confused in the pertinent related patents, public-relations announcements, memos related to NASA's progress, and communications between contractors and the public media.

2000 Winchester 400

The thirty-first annual Winchester 400 motor race (run yearly since 1970) was held under American Speed Association sanction on October 1, 2000, at the Winchester Speedway, Indiana (USA).
As a child, Gary St. Amant dreamed of winning the historic Winchester 400. Dominating the final stages of the event, St. Amant earned his first "400" victory and also clinched the Series Championship. It was the return o the American Speed Association to the legendary event for the first time since Glenn Allen Jr. won the 1991 event.
The race.
Larry Foyt was the quickest of the 38 cars that attempted to earn a spot in the starting field. Driving his Harrah’s Pontiac, he toured the oval in 15.656 seconds (114-972 MPH), establishing a modern ASA track record. Foyt would go from the pole to lead the first 43 laps until a majority of the field made pit stops under a yellow flag. Greg Stewart stayed on the track and assumed the lead until lap 83 when David Stremme made his first-ever appearance at the top of the "400" leader board. On track action and pit stops saw the lead shuffled several times over the first half of the race with Ricky Johnson, Mike Garvey, Scott Wimmer, and Joey Clanton all having a turn at the front.
In his first appearance at the intimidating oval, short-track veteran Mike Miller started showing his hand in the middle stages of the event. He first moved into the lead on the 196th lap, when he elected to stay on the track while others pitted for tires. Miller and Garvey swapped the lead on several occasions, before the last round of pit stops set the stage for the conclusion of the race. St. Amant’s crew performed lightning fast pit work, beating out Tim Sauter, while a slow stop relegated M. Miller to the tail of the lead lap cars. St. Amant was able to hold off all challengers over the final 70 laps and led T. Sauter by 0.680 seconds at the drop of the checkers. Robbie Pyle crossed the line in third with M. Miller fourth, and two-time winner Butch Miller in fifth. The top-five along with sixth place R. Johnson all completed the 400-lap distance. St. Amant grabbed a record $18,700 for his win.

Randolph, Tennessee

Randolph is an unincorporated rural community in Tipton County, Tennessee, United States, located on the banks of the Mississippi River. Randolph was founded in the 1820s and in 1827, the Randolph post office was established. In the 1830s, the town became an early center of river commerce in West Tennessee. Randolph shipped more cotton annually than Memphis until 1840. In 1834, the first pastor of the Methodist congregation was appointed. The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed railroad development, an unfavorable mail route and other factors. The first Confederate States Army fort in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the Civil War in 1861, a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by Union Army forces.
The settlement is located on the second Chickasaw Bluff, the landscape is dominated by valleys carved into the soil as a product of erosion. The surface soil is composed mostly of silt loam, derived from eroded loess, and is found in different qualities and at different stages of erosion. The stratum beneath the surface consists of glacial gravel. Randolph is situated on the southeastern edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, an area with a high earthquake risk. Between 1974 and 2004, forty-five earthquakes were recorded in a radius of around the settlement. Located in the humid subtropical climate zone, the climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and chilly to mild winters.
In 2008, "Randolph Bluff Historic Park" was dedicated. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public. As of 2008, Randolph has a population of about 200 and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by agriculture with no major industries and businesses present. The Girl Scouts Heart of the South operates a camp at Randolph.
History.
European settlement.
Around 1800, Europeans began settling the land east of the Mississippi River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa.
In the early 19th century, the terrain of the Chickasaw Bluffs provided promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for Randolph. In 1820, the area had an estimated population of 54. Early in the 1820s, investors John T. Brown and Robert Bedford were the owners of the land that would form Randolph a few years later. Only north of Memphis by water, they described the area as "a good landing for Mississippi River flatboats". The Hatchie River, joining the Mississippi River just north of Randolph, was accessible to steamboats upriver to Bolivar. Brown and Bedford chose the site to lay out the plan for Randolph, a promising river town. The "Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture" gives the date of Randolph's official establishment as 1823. Other reports date the foundation to 1827 or 1828. The settlement is named for John Randolph (1773–1833), a leader in the United States Congress from Virginia.
Cotton commerce.
Success.
Located on the banks of the Mississippi River, the topography of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and flatboats at all river stages. Randolph became the center of steamboat commerce in Tennessee. The town was an early rival of Memphis over commercial superiority on the Mississippi River.
In 1830, Randolph was the most important shipping point in Tennessee. In the mid-1830s, Randolph shipped up to 40,000 bales of cotton on the Mississippi River every year. More cotton was shipped from Randolph than from Memphis until 1840. At the peak of its commercial success, the community was called the "great steamboat depot of West Tennessee".
By 1829, Randolph had three commission warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one tavern. In 1834, Randolph had a population of approximately 1,000. By that time, the town had four hotels, almost fifty businesses, private schools, and more than ten saloons. In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the "Randolph Recorder" and the "Randolph Whig". In the 1830s, the first bank was founded and a stagecoach line provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson twice a week. The commercial success of Randolph can be attributed in part to the use of slave labor, mostly for the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated. In the "Randolph Recorder" during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves or offered rewards for runaway or stolen slaves.
Decline.
The fortunes of Randolph declined in the later 1840s and the 1850s due to many factors, starting shortly after the establishment of the town. Five years after the settlement was founded, a dispute over the ownership of the land the town was established on, arose over a faulty land title with land owner Ann Grambelling from New York. Until 1835, the pending lawsuit "prevented the growth of population" in and around Randolph. The residents of the community bought back the land their town was founded on for $8,000 in a settlement.
An unfavorable mail line also had an early and lasting influence on the fortunes of the town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put at the end of a branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.
Civil War.
Fortifications.
Fort Wright was the first Confederate Army fortification built at Randolph. On January 20, 1861, the Memphis "Appeal" published a pro-secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis. In April 1861, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered to establish a camp and complete the fortification at Randolph. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task. By June 1861, fifty cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright.
Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821–77) trained at Fort Wright. Forrest and other future leaders in the Confederate States Army and the Army of Tennessee received training at Fort Wright. The fort was Tennessee's first military training camp in which soldiers could gain experience in the construction of fortifications and the setup of artillery batteries. Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861. In 2008, only a powder magazine is left of Fort Wright.
Fort Randolph, the second Confederate stronghold in the area during the Civil War, was constructed in Fall 1861. The fortification was situated on the Mississippi River bluffs, about southwest of Fort Wright. In a dispatch published by the New York Times in March 1862, Fort Randolph is described as a "rough and incomplete earthwork (...), more than 100 feet above the river". The position of the fortification allowed a view of the Mississippi River for , both upstream and downstream. In 2008, Fort Randolph is no longer in existence.
Destruction.
In 1862, Union Army Major General William T. Sherman (1820–91) and his troops assumed control of Memphis and the surrounding areas. While trying to keep the area under Union control, Sherman became "frustrated by the constant guerrilla activity in his sector". Confederate guerrillas from the Randolph area weakened the Union forces along the Mississippi River.
In September 1862, the Union supply ship "Eugene" was fired at from Randolph. Sherman ordered to "destroy the place, leaving one house to mark the place". Union Army soldiers burned down Randolph in retaliation for the guerrilla attack. To his superior officer, General Ulysses S. Grant, Sherman reported that he had "given public notice that a repetition guerrilla attacks will justify any measures of retaliation". Randolph was burned down a second time by federal soldiers in 1865.
Geography and climate.
Geography.
Randolph is located at . The elevation above sea level is .
The surface soil in the Randolph area is composed mostly of silt loam of different qualities and at different stages of erosion. About 15% of the surface soil consists of "Adler silt loam" with a slope of 0–1%, found in the frequently flooded plains at Randolph. About 20% of the soil is severely eroded "Memphis silt loam" with 12–25% slopes, and ca. 35% of the soil consists of "Memphis silt loam" with 20–40% slopes. Less than 8% consists of moderately eroded "Memphis silt loam" with slopes from 1–5%. The remaining surface soil is composed of other silts, sands or clays, including "Robinsonville fine sandy loam" (ca. 6%) and "Tunica clay" (ca. 1.5%). Approximately 1.5% of the area is covered by water. The parent material of the "Memphis silt loam" is Pleistocene loess. Loess is a fine-grained, slightly coherent, silty, windblown sediment. Eroded loess consists of extremely fine, sandy particles and forms silt in environments that provide sufficient moisture of the soil, usually caused by occasional flooding or precipitation. Soil derived from eroded loess is sometimes also referred to as loess.
Landscape.
The settlement of Randolph is situated on top of the second Chickasaw Bluff, on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River in Tipton County. The four Chickasaw Bluffs are high grounds above the Mississippi River flood plains, composed of eroded pre-historic loess over glacial gravel. The Chickasaw Bluffs west of the community, on the banks of the Mississippi River, and flat cotton-fields east of Randolph dominate the rural landscape surrounding the settlement.
In the last 150 years, the general landscape around Randolph has not changed much. In 1862, the hinterland of the town is described to be "full of ravines and gorges". Ravines and gorges are valleys or canyons carved from the landscape as a product of erosion, caused by a stream or river or by seasonal precipitation, funneling water towards less elevated locations of the drainage basin. The landscape cut into the soil of the Mississippi River bluffs by water erosion for centuries is still present in modern times.
Roads.
In 1833, a stagecoach road from Randolph to Jackson in Madison County, east of Randolph, was established. The antebellum route connected the two towns as well as the villages along the way two times per week. Randolph and Memphis were connected by a direct travel route later in the 1830s. The road was part of a mail line between Jackson and Memphis in Shelby County on which mail was delivered weekly on horseback. The exact routing of the segment between Randolph and Memphis is unknown. A fragment of the route bearing the former name, about in length, was in existence until about 2005. The remaining piece of Old Randolph Road was located about north of the mouth of the Wolf River and east of the Mississippi River, just south of the mouth of the Loosahatchie River in Memphis. As of 2010, the remaining fragment of Old Randolph Road is destroyed, the land on which the historic mail route was located is used as an industrial property. A publication dated 1862, reports that Randolph is "approached in the rear by several good roads".
In 2008, Randolph is located near "good roads" as well as it was during the Civil War, with the exception that modern roads in the area are paved for the most part. U.S. Route 51 passes Randolph in the southeast and Tennessee State Route 59 (TN 59) passes southeast of the town. Four roads at county level converge at Randolph, as shown in the table below. A portion of Ballard Slough Road is located in the flood plains, this segment is prone to flooding and unpaved.

Waterways.
Randolph is located on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, just south of the lower mouth of the Hatchie River. In the 1820s, the Hatchie River at Randolph was accessible to steamboats for upriver to Bolivar in Hardeman County.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the federal agency responsible for navigable waters and flood protection, among many other peacetime and wartime tasks. From 2005 to 2007, the USACE spent $9,773,662 to ensure the navigation of the Mississippi River at Randolph for boats and barges and to provide flood protection for the immediately surrounding areas of the town. Contracts include surveying and mapping, engineering and construction, as well as tasks related to conservation and development of the Mississippi River and the river basin at Randolph. Maintenance related projects include dredging of the navigable channel of the Mississippi River at Randolph to remove sedimented sand and mud. Tasks related to conservation include dike construction to protect low-lying areas at Randolph from flooding and subsequent erosion. The "Navigation Bulletin No. 2", issued by the USACE in 2006, describes a stone dike construction at Randolph with an approximate elevation of at river mile 770L.
Earthquakes.
Located on the southeastern edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, the settlement of Randolph is situated in an area with a high earthquake risk. Between 1974 and 2004, ten earthquakes have been recorded in a radius of around Randolph. The magnitude of the temblors ranged from 1.5 to 3.2 on the Richter scale. The hypocenter depth ranged from to . In the same time period, at a radius of around Randolph, forty five earthquakes have been reported with magnitudes ranging from 1.0 to 3.2 at a depth between and . The highest magnitude earthquake recorded in the area since 1974 occurred on August 19, 1994 – the temblor was measured 3.2 on the Richter scale with an epicenter at coordinates , ca. west of Randolph, at a depth of .
On January 16, 2009 at 3:09 p.m. local time (21:09 UTC), "a small earthquake shook portions of Tipton County". The earthquake was measured at a magnitude 2.8 on the Richter scale. According to the Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), the epicenter of the temblor was reported to be at coordinates at a depth of . There were no reports of damage caused by the earthquake. The location of the epicenter was near the first Chickasaw Bluff, about east of Fort Pillow State Park and ca. northeast of Randolph. Smaller earthquakes along the New Madrid Seismic Zone are not uncommon.
Climate.
Randolph is located in a humid subtropical climate zone. The climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and chilly to mild winters. Significant amounts of precipitation occur in all seasons. At Randolph, July is the warmest month on the average. In 1930, the highest recorded temperature was measured at . January is the coolest month on the average. In 1951, the lowest recorded temperature was measured at . Precipitation peaks in December on the average. The table below displays the average monthly high and low temperatures and precipitation at Randolph.
Economy.
Agriculture is the predominating source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century . After the abolition of slavery in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the manual laborers.
In 2008, Randolph has a population of c. 200, and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by agriculture with no major industries and businesses present.
Culture.
Churches.
Randolph United Methodist Church.
In 1834, Reverend Samuel R. Davidson became the first pastor at Randolph. He was appointed by the "Tennessee Conference" of the United Methodist Church. After his appointment as a pastor of the community, a congregation formed around Davidson and built a church at Randolph. The second church at Randolph was built by the congregation in 1883. In 1953, construction of a new church was completed, the building was remodeled in 1975 and serves as a place of worship for the Methodist congregation of Randolph as of 2008.
The United Methodist Church at Randolph had 78 pastors as of 1983. In 2008, Reverend Thomas M. Yoder and Reverend Ben Rainey are the appointed pastors at the Randolph Methodist community.

Randolph Bluff Historic Park.
On October 11, 2008, the Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation, a non-profit organization, dedicated Randolph Bluff Historic Park in a celebration with politicians, conservationists, historians and community members. The property on the second Chickasaw Bluff was purchased for $378,000. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public, additional revenue from tourism is expected for the community. Once "Randolph Bluff Historic Park" is finished, it will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to "create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River", the project also promotes economical development and the preservation of land and wildlife in the Tennessee counties bordering the Mississippi River.

Frank T. Johns

Frank Tetes Johns (1889 - 1928) was a carpenter and American socialist political activist and politician. He is best remembered for having been twice nominated for President of the United States by the Socialist Labor Party of America.
Biography.
Early life.
Frank T. Johns was born February 23, 1889. He was a carpenter by trade and made his home in Portland, Oregon.
Political career.
Johns ran twice for U.S. Congress in the Oregon 3rd District, where he was the 1920 and 1922 nominee of the "Industrial Labor Party." This organization was name by which the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) was forced to appear on the Oregon ballot in those years due to state electoral laws.
Johns was nominated for President of the United States by the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) in 1924. At the time of his selection, Johns was the youngest person ever to be nominated by a political party to run for President, just 255 days over the constitutional requirement of 35 years. Johns and running mate Verne L. Reynolds received 33,904 votes from 20 states in which they appeared on the ballot.
The official report by the SLP's governing National Executive Committee to the organization's 1928 convention cast the 1924 campaign of Johns and Reynolds in a favorable light:
"An intense campaign was carried on in 1924 with the two candidates heading the force of agitators in the campaign. Both Comrades Johns and Reynolds performed splendid work for the Party, both of them exerting themselves almost to the point of exhaustion. Both candidates toured from east to west and addressed a great number of outdoor meetings with the number of attentive listeners running into the thousands. We succeeded in getting on the ballot in twenty states and although the vote that was cast might not seem proportionate to the effort expended, still we have cause to be satisfied with the result, for the SLP understands that it is not primarily a question of the number of votes cast, but the amount of agitation done and the number of workers reached, that counts."
Satisfied with their previous performance, the May National Convention of the Socialist Labor Party in New York City renominated their 1924 ticket of Frank T. Johns for President and Verne L. Reynolds for Vice President for the 1928 campaign.
Death and legacy.
The 1928 convention of the SLP adjourned on May 14 and the party's candidates immediately began to prepare to start their tours of America to speak on behalf of their candidacies and the socialist cause. Frank Johns headed home for Oregon, making his first appearance of the campaign in the Central Oregon town of Bend on Sunday afternoon, May 20. At the end of his speech, delivered at a park on the banks of the Deschutes River, Johns was answering the questions of some of those who had attended his speech. Suddenly, cries rang out from a young boy who had fallen from a footbridge into the river and was being swept away by the current. Johns instantly threw off his coat and dove into the frigid river in an attempt to retrieve the boy. He swam about 75 yards to reach the youngster and began to swim with him, pulling the boy to shore. A short distance from safety Johns' strength gave out and the pair were swept away to their deaths.
Frank Johns was 39 years old at the time of his death, and the boy he unsuccessfully tried to rescue, John C. "Jack" Rhodes, Jr. of Bend, was 10.
Distressed by the loss but choosing to move onward, on May 22, 1928 the NEC of the Socialist Labor Party made Verne Reynolds its new nominee for President. The party then added Jeremiah D. Crowley of Syracuse, New York to the ticket as its new choice for Vice President on June 7.
Johns was posthumously awarded a Carnegie Medal for Heroism, which paid his widowed wife (who died in 1933) and the couple's two daughters a stipend of $1,000 per year.

SAP Enterprise Architecture Framework

The SAP Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) is a methodology and toolset primarily to support the effective adoption of SOA. It is based on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and specifically designed to support packaged solutions and Service-oriented architecture (SOA).
The TOGAF Architecture Development Method is a generic method for architecture development, which is designed to deal with most system and organizational requirements. However, it will often be necessary to modify or extend the ADM, to suit specific needs.
SAP EAF is a complementary set of additions to TOGAF to support the specific characteristics of package and service-based architectures. SAP EAF was developed during 2007 by a team of SAP and Capgemini Enterprise Architects, most of whom were TOGAF 8.1 accredited practitioners. SAP EAF was formally launched at the SAP SAPPHIRE user conference in Atlanta, USA during 2007.

<doc id="19561784" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19561784" title="Sugars in wine">
Sugars in wine

The sugars in wine grapes are what make winemaking possible. During the process of fermentation, sugars are broken down and converted by yeast into alcohol (ethanol) and carbon dioxide. Grapes accumulate sugars as they grow on the grapevine through the translocation of sucrose molecules that are produced by photosynthesis from the leaves. During ripening the sucrose molecules are hydrolyzed (separated) by the enzyme invertase into glucose and fructose. By the time of harvest, between 15-25% of the grape will be composed of simple sugars. Both glucose and fructose are six-carbon sugars but three, four, five and seven-carbon sugars are also present in the grape. Not all sugars are fermentable with sugars like the five-carbon arabinose, rhamnose and xylose still being present in the wine after fermentation. Further very high sugar content will effectively kill the yeast once a certain (high) alcohol content is reached. For these reasons, no wine is ever fermented completely "dry" (meaning without any residual sugar). Sugar's role in dictating the final alcohol content of the wine (and such its resulting body and mouthfeel) will encourage winemakers to sometimes add sugar (usually sucrose) during winemaking in a process known as chaptalization solely in order to boost the alcohol content - chaptalization does not increase the "sweetness" of a wine.
Glucose.
Glucose, along with fructose, is one of the primary sugars found in wine grapes. In wine, glucose tastes less sweet than fructose. It is a six-carbon sugar molecule derived from the breakdown of sucrose. At the beginning of the ripening stage there is usually more glucose than fructose present in the grape (as much as five times more) but the rapid development of fructose shifts the ratio to where at harvest there are generally equal amounts. Grapes that are over ripe, such as some late harvest wines, may have more fructose than glucose. During fermentation, yeast cells break down and convert glucose first. The linking of glucose molecules with aglycone, in a process that creates glycosides, also plays a role in the resulting flavor of the wine due to their relation and interactions with phenolic compounds like anthocyanins and terpenoids.
Fructose.
Fructose, along with glucose, is one of the principal sugars involved in the creation of wine. At time of harvest, there is usually an equal amount of glucose and fructose molecules in the grape; however, as the grape over ripens the level of fructose will become higher. In wine, fructose can taste nearly twice as sweet as glucose and is a key component in the creation of sweet dessert wines. During fermentation, glucose is consumed first by the yeast and converted into alcohol. A winemaker that chooses to halt fermentation (either by temperature control or the addition of brandy spirits in the process of fortification) will be left with a wine that is high in fructose and notable residual sugars. The technique of "süssreserve", where unfermented grape must is added after the wine's fermentation is complete, will result in a wine that tastes less sweet than a wine whose fermentation was halted. This is because the unfermented grape must will still have roughly equal parts of fructose and the less sweet tasting glucose. Similarly, the process of chaptalization where sucrose (which is one part glucose and one part fructose) is added will usually not increase the sweetness level of the wine.
Sucrose.
In most wines, there will be very little sucrose, since it is not a natural constituent of grapes and sucrose added for the purpose of chaptalisation will be consumed in the fermentation. The exception to this rule is Champagne and other sparkling wines, to which an amount of "liqueur d'expédition" (typically sucrose dissolved in a still wine) is added after the second fermentation in bottle, a practice known as "dosage".
In wine tasting.
In wine tasting, humans are least sensitive to the taste of sweetness (in contrast to sensitivity to bitterness or sourness) with the majority of the population being able to detect sugar or "sweetness" in wines between 1% and 2.5% residual sugar. Additionally, other components of wine such as acidity and tannins can mask the perception of sugar in the wine.
Flash release.
Flash release is a technique used in wine pressing. The technique allows for a better extraction of wine polysaccharides.
See also.
Gluconic acid, an acid sugar, is also found in wine.

Dunsfold Aerodrome

Dunsfold Aerodrome (ICAO code EGTD) is an airfield in Surrey, England, near the village of Cranleigh.
It was built by the Canadian Army and civilian contractors as a class A bomber airfield for Army Co-operation Command. It was commanded by the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1942–1944 and was known as Royal Canadian Air Force Station Dunsfold. Under RAF control it was RAF Dunsfold.
Post war it was used by Hawker Siddeley and then its successor British Aerospace.
History.
Construction and military use.
Canadian engineers were charged with the construction of the aerodrome. Such projects had previously taken up to a year to complete and this site was complicated by the two hundred acres of woodland that first had to be cleared. The Canadian sappers had access to large-scale earth moving equipment from North America obtained under Lend-Lease arrangements. The Canadians also had pipe-pushing apparatus place explosives under trees thereby facilitating their rapid removal. The aerodrome was completed in just six months.
The first squadrons based at the aerodrome were 400, 414 and 430 Squadrons, RCAF, equipped with Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks and North American P-51 Mustangs. They were followed by the North American B-25 Mitchell Mk II medium bombers of No. 139 Wing RAF, consisting of 98 and 180 Squadrons RAF, and 320 Squadron (formed from Dutch Naval Aviation Service personnel). When 139 Wing departed for the continent in the autumn of 1944, 83 Group Support Unit (later 83 Group Disbandment Centre) arrived with Spitfires, Typhoons and Tempests. After the war the airfield was used by the RAF to repatriate prisoners-of-war.
Dunsfold was declared inactive by the RAF in 1946 but was then used by Skyways Ltd, with York, Lancastrian, [C-54 Skymaster|Skymaster], Rapide and Dove aircraft. Skyways' operations included support of the Berlin Airlift. Skyways also refurbished ex-RAF Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes for the Portuguese Air Force.
Post-war use.
In 1950 The Hawker Aircraft Company acquired the lease of the site. Dunsfold became internationally known for development of the Hunter jet fighter; limited numbers of Sea Hawks were also produced and Sea Furies were refurbished. Airwork Ltd leased two hangars from 1953-58 for the refurbishment of North American F-86 Sabres and Supermarine Attackers.
In October 1960 the then Hawker Siddeley flight tested its Hawker P.1127 prototype, the development aircraft that led to the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first VTOL jet fighter bomber. Folland Gnat test flying and production moved to Dunsfold from Chilbolton, Hampshire, in 1961. Final assembly of the Harrier and the Hawk trainer aircraft was at Dunsfold.
Hawker Siddeley became part of British Aerospace in 1977. On 2 July 1986 British Aerospace's deputy chief test pilot Jim Hawkins was killed at Dunsfold when his developmental Hawk 200 crashed. On 24 June 1999 British Aerospace announced the closure of Dunsfold as part of a restructuring; Hawk final assembly had been transferred to Warton in 1988, the BAe Sea Harrier production finished in 1998 and the Harrier 2+ production was moved to Brough in 2000. The gate guardian aircraft - Hawker P.1127 "XP984" - was moved to Brooklands Museum on long term loan.
Present day.
In 2002 BAE Systems (British Aerospace's successor) sold Dunsfold Aerodrome to The Rutland Group who formed Dunsfold Park Ltd. Today the BBC motoring show "Top Gear" is recorded at the park using a hangar as a studio and parts of the runways and taxiways of the aerodrome as their test track.
Some of the track is now used by many driving schools and instructors to enable under 17-year-olds to learn to drive. Hundreds of youngsters have now had their first driving experience at the Top Gear location before going out on to the road.
Dunsfold Park is also home to Wings and Wheels, an annual air and motor show that is typically held in late August. The airshow attracted over 25,000 visitors and raised over £80,000 for charities including Help for Heroes and the Surrey & Sussex Air Ambulance in 2009. Increasing popularity has meant the event is now a two-day show. 
Dunsfold Park Ltd also organises a drive-in cinema, Dunsfold Drive-In over the Easter bank holiday as well as a popular and classical concert, Strings & Wings [http://www.stringsandwings.com.
In 2006, the owners of Dunsfold Aerodrome proposed the construction of a new settlement with 2,600 homes on the site, a school, health services, public transport and road links to the A281, and an expanded business district. The project was designed to be an examplar of green and sustainable living. 
In late 2007, Dunsfold Park Ltd. applied to have their plans for the new town selected as one of the then Labour government's proposed eco-towns. On 3 April 2008 Dunsfold Park was one of over 40 proposals denied eco-town status by the then housing minister Caroline Flint. The government's summary assessment said that the bid was too small in terms of house numbers, because the proposal at Dunsfold was for only 2,600 houses whereas the minimum size for an eco-town was 5,000. The assessment also said that the public transport offering needed further work. 
In May 2008 Dunsfold Park Limited applied to Waverley Borough Council for planning consent for the eco-settlement. It was opposed by local residents, Surrey County Council, four borough councils and 13 parish councils as well as the South East England Regional Assembly and the South East England Development Agency. It received support from Age Concern Waverley, Guildford Labour Party, Farnham Labour Party, Cranleigh Labour Party and the former Lib Dem MP for Guildford, Sue Doughty. It also received support from some environmentalists, including leading national authorities on sustainable living such as Professor Roland Clift and from national Friends of the Earth, for its innovative approach and contribution to sustainable development. Friends of the Earth also supported the development on the basis that re-development as an eco-settlement would remove the threat of aviation expansion at Dunsfold once and for all. However the proposal was refused planning permission by the local borough council (Waverley) and in 2009 rejected on appeal by the then secretary of state John Denham. 
Although the owners say they still hope to persuade the authorities that eco-settlement remains the best long term future for the site they say they are now concentrating on expanding and promoting the underlying aviation potential of the aerodrome which is still in operational use.
Dunsfold Park's existing lawful use is in part as an aerodrome under a series of temporary planning consents which contain restrictions on the levels of aircraft movement and restrict flying to certain times. However the long term and permanent underlying use has been a matter of considerable dispute between the owners and the council. In April 2011, Dunsfold Park claimed that the use of the site for aviation was entirely unrestricted on the grounds that the use predated the introduction of the planning acts or alternatively that a 60 year old planning consent dating from 1951 allowed the unrestricted use of the aerodrome for aviation. The claim led to objections from parties such as all the local parish councils and bodies such as the Council to Protect Rural England and Friends of the Earth and concern was expressed by local MPs.
In June 2011, Waverley Borough Council refused Dunsfold Park Ltd's application for a certificate of lawful use as an aerodrome. Dunsfold appealed but the appeal was rejected in April 2012. When rejecting the appeal the inspector made reference to the old planning consent granted in 1951 for "erection, repair and flight testing of aircraft" stating that it was now agreed by all parties that "it was and is a permanent permission" and that the use at Dunsfold will revert to the 1951 consent, without restriction, in 2018 on expiry of the existing temporary consents.
Memorial.
A memorial, funded by public subscription, was erected outside the nearby Alfold Barn pub (on the A281 road between Guildford and Horsham) with the permission of Alfold Parish Council. Dunsfold Parish Council declined to host the memorial.
The memorial and its unveiling on 20 July 1992, exactly 50 years to the day after the first aircraft (an RCAF Tiger Moth) landed at Dunsfold, was organised by the Dunsfold Society of Mssrs Alan Barrett, Paul McCue, Gareth Morgan, Peter Robinson and Brian Spencer. A Tiger Moth and Lockheed P-3 Orion (of present-day 320 Sqn RDNAS) performed fly-pasts.
Museum.
A museum is maintained on site (open on Wednesdays to the public) by Reg Day who served with 98 Sqn RAF at Dunsfold in 1943-44.
Incidents and accidents.
On 20 November 1975 a test flight of a Hawker Siddeley HS.125 G-BCUX was taking off on runway 07 when, just as aircraft became airborne, the flight was struck by birds. The pilots tried to land back onto the runway but the aircraft overran the runway and struck a passing car on the A281 road. The aircraft stopped in a field and was destroyed by fire. All six people inside the car died, and one crew member out of nine passengers and crew was injured.
On 2 July 1986 British Aerospace's deputy chief test pilot Jim Hawkins was killed at Dunsfold when his developmental Hawk 200 ZG200 crashed into farmland just beyond the road outside the airfield's southern boundary. 
On 5 June 1998 a Hawker Hunter (G-HHUN) crashed at Dunsfold prior to that weekend's airshow. The pilot, John Davis, was killed.
Appearance in film.
A Boeing 747-200 which served with British Airways until 2002 as "City of Birmingham", G-BDXJ, was purchased by Aces High Limited, a company specialising in supplying aircraft for television and film work, and transferred to Dunsfold. It was modified and used for filming for the 2006 James Bond film "Casino Royale". Some of the scenes set at Miami International Airport were filmed at Dunsfold. The aircraft has also appeared in the background of numerous "Science in Action" and "Top Gear" episodes and directly in an episode where it was towed by a JCB Fastrac tractor, and in many other programmes and commercials.
The airfield also found use when filming several scenes inside the aircraft for Come Fly with Me, starring Matt Lucas and David Walliams.
In 2009, for major parts of Episode 4 of ITV Series "Primeval" featuring a giganotosaurus, Dunsfold was used as the location for an unspecified London airport.
In 2013, for the closing sequences of the film "Red 2", Dunsfold was used as an undisclosed airfield near London. Both the Boeing 747-200 and the Dakota aircraft regularly visible in the background of Top Gear's test track features are seen during the closing car chase of the film.

<doc id="19561839" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19561839" title="Toronto Rocket">
Toronto Rocket

The Toronto Rocket (TR) is the newest model of subway trains on the Toronto subway and RT network, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, owned and operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TRs are the only trains operating in North America with a "six-car fixed" configuration with full-open interior gangways, (which are similar to that on the TTC's Articulated Light Rail Vehicle streetcars, the TTC's new low floor streetcars and its new low-floor articulated buses). This allows passengers to move freely from one end to the other, unlike the previous TTC train models (which were built in 2 car mated pairs and operate as 2 or 3 pair (4 or 6 car) train sets respectively, meaning passengers are not allowed to move from car to car through the inter-car doors). The TR trains have two cab cars (the first and last car of the train) and four non-driving cars. They are built by Bombardier Transportation in Thunder Bay, with designs based on Bombardier's Movia family of trains.
The TR series trains operate only on Line 1 (Yonge–University–Spadina (Y-U-S)) subway. They have replaced the remaining H4 and H5 trains, which were the oldest lines of subway trains that had been in revenue service since the 1970s. The H4s were the last in the TTC train fleet to be furnished with large orange vinyl bench seating and did not have air-conditioning systems, some of which have been retained by the TTC for use as maintenance trains.
As more TR trains enter service, the remaining T1 series trains serving Line 1 (Y-U-S line) will move onto Line 2 (Bloor–Danforth line), which will replace the older H6 series trains. In turn, some of the H6s are being shipped to the United States (along with the retired H5 cars) for refurbishing and conversion to standard gauge and will ultimately be shipped to the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority for use on the Authority's new Eko Rail project in Lagos, Nigeria.
Name.
The trains were designated under the production name as T35A08 before the name "Toronto Rocket" was chosen through a contest open to the public.
Delivery.
The TR trains were expected to be delivered starting in late 2009 and start passenger service in early 2010. However, delivery was delayed by the bankruptcy of a key part manufacturer, Curtis Doors, which was to install door components for the TTC's new subway trains.
The initial order was signed in 2006 for the delivery of 234 cars, making for 39 six-car fixed trains. This allowed the retirement of the older H4 and H5 series trains.
On May 6, 2010, however, the TTC voted to exercise a contract option with Bombardier for an additional 186 cars, making for 31 six-car fixed train sets. This would allow the TTC to retire the older H6 series trains operating on Line 2 (Bloor–Danforth subway), and to have enough TR series trains available to meet future ridership demands for the opening of the Spadina Subway extension to the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre.
On October 1, 2010, the first train set (5391-5396) was delivered to Wilson Yard and was first unveiled to the public and media at Downsview station on October 14, 2010.
In early May 2011, testing and operator training began during revenue service hours. The trains did not provide service for passengers at the time. The TTC held another open house (as part of Doors Open Toronto) at Davisville station on May 29, 2011, where passengers were able to tour the new TR train again.
The first TR train (5411-5416) entered revenue service on July 21, 2011. In February 2014, 48 TR trains were available for revenue service. The delivery of all 70 six-car fixed train sets (420 cars) is scheduled to be completed by mid-2014.
Features.
The TR series trains have several new features that make them more accessible and user-friendly for passengers including:
Additional features.
In February 2013, TR train set 5461-5466 was retrofitted with additional features including exterior door chime speakers located at each doorway, displacing the exterior blue accessibility lights. The same train set also has been retrofitted with additional yellow plastic straps placed underneath the HVAC units, while all other TR trains have the door chimes played via the train's interior public address system.
Fleet numbers.
The TR train sets are numbered 5381-6076, most of which have been re-used from retired TTC vehicles, including the H1, H2, H4, H5, H6 subway cars and old Flyer D-901A buses, each set is numbered 5xx1-5xx6, car numbers ending in 0, 7, 8 and 9 are not used, these will be the first trains to adopt numbering in the 6000's, since the TR's are a six-car fixed configuration (unlike previous models which are formed in married pairs), most sets are numbered as for example 5381-5382-5383-5384-5385-5386 and so on, however two train sets have had their numbers mixed up separately, these include sets, 5781-5786 in which the exterior bears 5803, and set 5801-5806 bears 5783 on the exterior car.
Criticism.
Tendering process.
During the tendering process, Siemens was seen a possible competitor to the Bombardier bid. Councillors Karen Stintz (who later also serves as TTC chair), Denzil Minnan-Wong, and Rob Ford (who later became mayor in late 2010) were opposed to sole-sourcing the contract to Bombardier. They alleged that many sole-source advocates had union ties and were thus not interested in getting the best financial deal available to the city.
Mobility issues.
In late September 2011, it was reported that some passengers with mobility devices were experiencing difficulties while entering and/or exiting the new trains. TTC officials noted that this could either be because the train was sitting too high in relation to the level of the platform or be the result of the train’s door threshold, which is not parallel with the platform and/or the number of passengers riding on the train. They were actively looking for ways to solve the problem.
To increase mobility, the train does not have centre poles, which leaves standing riders with fewer places to hold onto. There are swinging handles hanging from a lateral pole along the length of each car near the ceiling, except for near the doors, which instead features an overhead ventilation unit.
"Teething issues".
In March 2012, TTC officials admitted that the door threshold incidents were the result of “teething issues”. Another issue that was acknowledged involves a short delay in opening of the doors when the train pulls into a station. On the older train models, the door release interlock could be triggered just before or immediate after the vehicle came to a complete stop. The TR trains must come to a complete stop with confirmation from the on board computer before the door interlock can be released and the operator can open the doors. This causes a one- or two-second delay from the time the train appears stopped and the time the doors open.
In December 2012, the TTC announced a demanded high-level meeting with Bombardier regarding ongoing performance problems related to "teething issues" with the doors, TTC officials admitted at the time that the TR trains cannot move until all doors are fully closed and if the doors fail to fully close three times in a row, the TR train would require a system reboot, meaning that the train will have to be pulled out of service until it is resolved; this has led to several delays on the Yonge–University–Spadina line.
Increased brightness.
The TR trains feature a significantly brighter interior than previous models, which some passengers find distracting.

Torpedo bulkhead

A torpedo bulkhead is a type of armor common on the more heavily armored warships, especially battleships and battlecruisers of the early 20th century. It is designed to keep the ship afloat even if the hull was struck underneath the belt armor by a shell or by a torpedo. After the lessons learned during World War I, many capital ships were refitted with double, triple, or even quadruple torpedo bulkheads, as well as anti-torpedo bulges to the exterior of the hull. For example, the last US battleship designs during World War II had up to four torpedo bulkheads and a triple-bottom. The innermost bulkhead is commonly referred to as the "holding bulkhead", and often this bulkhead would be manufactured from high tensile steel that could deform and absorb the pressure pulse from a torpedo hit without breaking. If the final bulkhead was at least 37mm thick, it may also be referred to as an "armored bulkhead", as it would be capable of stopping splinters and shells with low striking velocities.

Arthur Payne (speedway rider)

Arthur Payne (born 28 August 1923 in Sydney, New South Wales) was an Australian international speedway rider who finished fifth in the 1952 Speedway World Championship final.
Career.
Payne arrived in the UK in 1947 and signed up with the Tamworth Hounds in the National League Division Three. After scoring almost three hundred points for the Hounds, he was transferred to the Birmingham Brummies for £500, a record fee for a third division rider at that time.
Payne struck up an excellent partnership with Brummies captain Stan Dell and the Brummies were promoted from National League Division Two at then end of the 1948 season. In 1949, with the Brummies in National League Division One, Payne had ridden in all three divisions within the first three years of his career. 
It was with the Brummies his career flourished, reaching the World Final three times in four years, finishing fifth in his second appearance.

Root hog, or die

"Root, hog, or die" is a common American catch-phrase dating from well before 1834. Coming from the early colonial practice of turning pigs loose in the woods to fend for themselves, the term is an idiomatic expression for self-reliance.
Songs.
The term resulted in several songs with the same theme.
"Root Hog Or Die" (c. 1854).
Several songs of unknown authorship were published before the Civil War, including patriotic and minstrel songs. A patriotic version opens with:
"Root, Hog, or Die" (1856).
The most popular song of the era was a minstrel song variously titled "Root, Hog, Or Die" or "Do Jog Along", sometimes credited to George W.H. Griffin, which was first copyrighted in 1856. Many variations exist—a common first verse is:
"Root Hog Or Die" (1858).
A song from the gold field camps on the front range of the Rockies written by G.W.H. Griffin in 1858 addressed the hardships of gold miners. The first verse:
Civil War songs.
Both sides in the Civil War had "root, hog, or die" songs. A verse from "Flight of Doodles", a Confederate song, is typical:
"A Philosophical Cowboy".
A folk song collected in 1911 tells of the hard life of the cowboy. The last verse is:
This version, and variations of it, are still recorded.
Newer versions have also been recorded. June Carter Cash had a minor hit in the 1950's with her version, now available on Youtube with guitar by Chet Atkins. The first verse is as follows:
When I was young and pretty
With a twinkling in my eye
I met a traveling man one day
And I guess he told a lie
When we was a courting
He called me sugar pie
Now he calls me other names
It's root, hog, or die
Root, hog, or die
Tell you the reason why
I met a traveling man one day
And I guess he told a lie

The Penguins of Madagascar

The Penguins of Madagascar is an American CGI animated television series airing on Nickelodeon. It stars nine characters from the DreamWorks Animation animated film "Madagascar": The penguins Skipper (Tom McGrath), Rico (John DiMaggio), Kowalski (Jeff Bennett), and Private (James Patrick Stuart); the lemurs King Julien (Danny Jacobs), Maurice (Kevin Michael Richardson), and Mort (Andy Richter); and Mason (Conrad Vernon) and Phil the chimpanzees. Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter (Nicole Sullivan) and a zookeeper named Alice (Mary Scheer). It is the first Nicktoon produced with DreamWorks Animation.
A pilot episode, "Gone in a Flash", aired as part of "Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend" on November 29, 2008, and "The Penguins of Madagascar" became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere.
Although the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, "The Penguins of Madagascar" does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place "not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe."
The show finished 2010 as the number two animated program on television among kids age 2–11 and in basic cable total viewers.
A feature film starring the penguins is in production for 2015.
Plot.
"The Penguins of Madagascar" is a spin-off of the "Madagascar" films. The series follows the adventures of four penguins: Skipper, Rico, Kowalski, and Private, who perform various paramilitary-like missions to protect their home in the Central Park Zoo. The penguins often have to deal with problems caused, or made worse, by King Julien XIII (a ring-tailed lemur), Maurice (an aye-aye), and Mort (a mouse lemur).
Characters.
"The Penguins of Madagascar" features the four penguin characters from the "Madagascar" franchise, as well as the two chimpanzees and the three lemurs. Characters new to the franchise include Marlene the otter and Alice the zookeeper, among others.
All four of the penguin characters are designed differently in the cartoon than they are in the movie to make them more unique and easier to tell apart. Skipper's head is flatter in the series, Rico has an unexplained scar over his mouth, a double chin, and a feathery Mohawk, Kowalski is taller, and Private is shorter and rounder. Their personalities and abilities were also exaggerated. The texture of the characters was also changed to be better suited for television work.
Production.
In mid 2006, Nickelodeon and DreamWorks Animation announced that they would collaborate to create a Nicktoon based on the "Madagascar" films. The new series would star the penguins from the film series. Nothing was confirmed on what the series would be about until November 2007.
At first, in November 2007, Nickelodeon advertised a sneak peek of three new Nicktoons coming to Nickelodeon, "The Mighty B!", "Making Fiends", and "The Penguins of Madagascar" all on November 25, 2007, as part of "Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend". Then, in December 2007, Nickelodeon advertised many events that were going to premiere in 2008 ("The Mighty B!", "Fairly OddBaby", "The Penguins of Madagascar", KCA 2008, "", and "Pest of the West"). Since then, "The Penguins of Madagascar" was delayed at least twice in 2008, and saw a debut in March 2009, most likely due to "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" being delayed to November 7, 2008. On November 28, 2008, Nickelodeon aired an episode from the series as a sneak peek. The Double DVD Pack of "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" includes an early preview of the show.
Casting.
Some of the voice actors who voiced the characters in the films were unable to reprise their roles for the series. Chris Miller, who had voiced Kowalski, was replaced by Jeff Bennett, while Christopher Knights was replaced by James Patrick Stuart for the voice of Private. Danny Jacobs took over from Sacha Baron Cohen as the voice of King Julien, and Cedric the Entertainer's character, Maurice, is now voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. Tom McGrath, John DiMaggio, Andy Richter and Conrad Vernon reprised their roles of Skipper, Rico, Mort and Mason for the TV series, respectively. Other characters are voiced by the same actors who had voiced them in the films, while some characters, like Marlene and Alice the zookeeper, are new characters created especially for the series.
Nickelodeon debut.
After some delays of the series to air, "The Penguins of Madagascar" debuted on Nickelodeon in 2009. The series is produced at the Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, with animation carried out in India, New Zealand and Taiwan. Both Nickelodeon and DreamWorks Animation were planning on a 26 episode season. "The Penguins of Madagascar" aired after the "2009 Kids' Choice Awards" on March 28, 2009 at 9:30 pm ET/PT.
Broadcast.
"The Penguins of Madagascar" premiered in Australia April 18, 2009 on Nickelodeon Australia. In Canada, the series premiered September 12, 2009 on Nickelodeon Canada and YTV. In Ireland, the series premiered on Nickelodeon Ireland and RTÉ Two on April 12, 2009. The series debuted in New Zealand April 18, 2009 on Nickelodeon (New Zealand). In the United Kingdom, the series premiered April 12, 2009 on Nickelodeon UK, CITV, and Viva. Nickelodeon aired a "sneak peak" preview of "The Penguins of Madagascar" in the United States November 29, 2008, and officially launched the series March 28, 2009.
Critical reception.
"The Penguins of Madagascar" has been given mixed to positive critical reviews. Mary McNamara of the "Los Angeles Times" gave the show a favorable review. She said that the show had strong comedic timing and action scenes, saying that it recalled both Wile E. Coyote cartoons and 1940s gangster movies. Tim Goodman's review in the "San Francisco Chronicle" is also favorable. He said that he considered the penguins and Julien as having the most comedic potential from the movies, with his review focusing on the voice actors' comedic timing, and said that the show also contained several jokes which would make it appealing to adults.
Brian Lowry of "Variety" described the show as "loud, exuberant and colorful" and praised its animation quality, but he did not think that it was funny and said that the show seemed more like a "merchandising bonanza".
Toys.
DreamWorks has licensed to a number of manufacturers, including Hooga Loo Toys, who had a successful run creating a line of plush toys associated with the second Madagascar movie. Based on its success, Hooga Loo was granted a license to create an entirely new toy line for the new series. Hooga Loo recruited the creative development team, Pangea Corporation, the company who assisted Playmates Toys in the development of the very successful "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", to work systemically with DreamWorks and develop toys inspired by the series. The toy line included a full range of plush characters, as well as collectible figures and wacky vehicles. Fast food restaurants courted DreamWorks to glean the rights for a QSR deal, which finally materialized in late 2009. McDonald's had produced a line of toys based on the second film. This relationship forged a new deal with McDonald's.
Licensed merchandise based on the show began debuting in January 2010. In February 2010, McDonald's began their "Mission: Play" Happy Meal toy campaign, which featured eight toys based on the penguins in the series.
Feature film.
A spin-off feature film, starring the penguins from the franchise, is slated for release on March 27, 2015. However, the film has been said to be unrelated to the TV series, though this could still change.

Anthony Miller (murderer)

Anthony Joseph Miller (1941–December 22 1960) became the second-last criminal to be executed in Scotland when he was hanged on the gallows at Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison by Harry Allen, assisted by Robert Leslie Stewart, on December 22 1960. Miller had been convicted of murdering John Cremin at Queen's Park Recreation Ground (near Hampden Park) in Glasgow on 6 April 1960. At 19 years of age, Miller was the last teenager to be executed in the United Kingdom.
The murder of John Cremin was a robbery that went wrong. Miller and his accomplice James Denovan were in the habit of working together as a team, robbing gay men. They would use Denovan (a 16 year old boy) as bait to attract victims. After Denovan had lured the victims to a secluded area of the park out of public view, Miller would suddenly appear, threatening the victims with violence unless they handed over all their valuables. During this particular robbery Cremin was beaten to death and his body hidden under bushes, where it was later discovered by a man out walking his dog.
As a 19 year old Miller was legally an adult, and because the murder took place during the course of a robbery (Cremin had been robbed of his watch, bankbook and £67), this made him eligible for the death penalty under the terms of the Homicide Act of 1957. However, as a 16-year-old, Denovan was considered a child in the judicial system and therefore too young to face the death penalty. Consequently, he was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure. 
Miller's family organized a petition to the Secretary of State for Scotland calling for a reprieve, with a stall in Glasgow city centre. It received 30 000 signatures, but it was turned down.
Miller's execution was the last to take place at HMP Barlinnie.
A theatre play about Miller's last days in the condemned cell – "Please, Mister" (the title comes from Miller's alleged last words on the scaffold before his death) – was written by Patrick Harkins and first performed in 2010. The initial production starred Iain de Caestecker (in the role of Miller) and David Hayman.
The last ever judicial execution in Scotland was that of Henry John Burnett, which took place in Aberdeen on 15 August 1963.

USCGC Swivel (WYTL-65603)

USCGC "Swivel" (WYTL-65603) was one of fifteen 65-foot steel-hulled harbor tugs, that entered service with the United States Coast Guard in the 1960s. Each was built to replace the 64-foot wooden-hulled harbor tugs built during the 1940s.
Ship history.
USCGC "Swivel" was built by the Gibbs Gas Engine Company of Jacksonville, Florida, at a cost of $158,000 dollars. She was commissioned on 27 October 1961. The 65-footers remained unnamed until the mid-1960s. "Swivel" was assigned to the First Coast Guard District and was based in Rockland, Maine. Her crew consisted of an Officer in Charge (OINC), a Chief Boatswain Mate (E-7); an Executive Petty Officer (XPO), a First Class Boatswain Mate (E-6); an Engineering Petty Officer (EPO), a First Class Machinist Mate (E-6); a Second Class Machinist Mate (E-5) and three non-rated crew (E-3 or E-2).
"Swivel's" area of operation was mainly Penobscot Bay and extended westward to Whitehead Lighthouse, easterly to Saddleback Ledge and northward through East Penobscot Bay, Castine, and up the Penobscot River to the city of Bangor, Maine. "Swivel"s operations throughout the year included domestic icebreaking, aids to navigation, search and rescue, marine environmental protection, maritime law enforcement and commercial fishing vessel safety.
"Swivel's" main mission in the summer months was to maintain more than fifty fixed (non-floating) Coast Guard aids to navigation, including five lighthouses. During the winter months the "Swivel" kept local harbors free of ice and spent a week in rotation with two other cutters keeping the Penobscot River open to navigation for fuel barges that transported home heating fuel, gasoline and aviation fuel to Bangor and the surrounding communities.
"Swivel" received a Coast Guard Unit Commendation and two Meritorious Unit Commendations for her missions, along with the Coast Guard Unit Commendation presented to all 1st Coast Guard District units involved with the 1994 ice season.
"Swivel" was decommissioned at a ceremony held at the pier in Rockland, Maine, on 14 April 1995.
As part of the Coast Guard's closing of its base on Governors Island in New York City, the "Swivel" was brought down as a passenger and work boat for the Coast Guard and U.S. General Services Administration base closure staff.
As of 2009 "Swivel" is now a service and staff boat owned by the Trust for Governors Island, which is redeveloping the former Coast Guard base at Governors Island, New York City.

Lioré et Olivier LeO H-43

__NOTOC__
The Lioré et Olivier LeO H-43 was a reconnaissance seaplane produced in France in the 1930s. It was a strut-braced, mid-wing monoplane of largely conventional design, provided with an observation balcony underneath the fuselage. It was designed to be launched by catapult from warships and, after a first flight in 1934, trials were conducted on board "Commandant Teste".
Development was prolonged and the prototype underwent much modification before an order for 20 machines was placed by the Aéronavale. Even after this, a major redesign to the forward fuselage was specified as part of the production order. As a result, the first test flight of the production version did not take place until 13 July 1939, by which time the H-43 was already obsolete.
The twenty examples purchased briefly equipped two squadrons from February 1940, but all were withdrawn with the Fall of France.

Christian Benteke

Christian Benteke Liolo (born 3 December 1990) is a Belgian footballer who plays as a striker for Aston Villa in the Premier League and the Belgium national team.
Early life.
Benteke was born in Kinshasa in 1990. He and his family fled during the Mobutu regime and emigrated to Liège, Belgium.
Club career.
Standard Liège and Genk.
Benteke played youth football for JS Pierreuse and later Standard Liège before moving to Genk. He returned to Standard in January 2009. On 7 August 2009 he joined KV Kortrijk on loan for a season. He spent the following season on loan at Mechelen as part of the transfer of Aloys Nong, who moved from Mechelen to Standard Liège. He returned to Genk in 2011, scoring 19 goals in 37 appearances during one season at the club.
Aston Villa.
2012–13 season.
On 31 August 2012, Benteke joined Premier League club Aston Villa on a four-year deal for a fee believed to be around £7 million. Benteke stated it was a dream come true in getting a move to the Premier League and thanked the players and manager at K.R.C. Genk for his move.
On 15 September 2012, Benteke scored on his debut for Aston Villa in a 2–0 win against Swansea City, after coming on as a substitute for Austrian forward Andreas Weimann. The goal came when Swansea defender Ashley Williams headed the ball into Benteke's path, which he then lifted over the keeper and tapped in on the volley. Villa manager Paul Lambert praised Benteke's performance on his debut calling him "unplayable". He then scored Villa's only goal in a 1–1 home draw with Norwich City. He added a further two goals to his tally during a 3–2 victory over Swindon Town in the League Cup. He scored the winner in a 1–0 Premier League victory for Villa against Reading at Villa Park on 27 November to continue his impressive start in English football.
Benteke then scored Villa's fourth goal in a 4–1 League Cup win over Norwich City at Carrow Road. Benteke further added to his impressive start in Premier League football by scoring two goals in Villa's 3–1 win against Liverpool at Anfield on 15 December. In addition to the two goals, he also assisted Villa's second goal with a back-heel to Andreas Weimann. Paul Lambert said afterwards that 'Benteke has been unbelievable', after already stating midweek (post–Norwich) that 'you run out of things to say about the guy, how well he's performing and how young he is'. Around Christmas time, Tottenham Hotspur manager Andre Villas-Boas was reportedly interested in signing Benteke, referring to him as the season's "surprise package". 
After not scoring for three games, Benteke scored Villa's first penalty kick in almost a year in a 2–2 draw away to Swansea City in Villa's first game of 2013. He recorded his 10th goal of the season with a 28-yard strike against West Midlands rivals West Bromwich Albion in a 2–2 draw at The Hawthorns. The goal was nominated for January's goal of the month competition on Match of the Day. He then netted Villa's first goal in their 2–1 League Cup semi-final victory over Bradford City. However, the victory was not enough as Bradford won 4–3 on aggregate to progress to the final. Former England striker Michael Owen called him one of the signings of the season and posted a tweet the day after the semi-final saying: 'I'm seriously impressed with Benteke.What a player.' Benteke continued his rich scoring form with a goal against Newcastle United and a brace against Everton, in a game that Villa had led 3–1 at one point but eventually finished3–3. He racked up his 15th goal in all competitions, as well as tallying six goals in five games, when he scored a penalty in a 2–1 victory against West Ham United on 10 February 2013. This was Villa's first league victory in eight games, since Benteke inspired the win against Liverpool back in December.
During a league game against Manchester City on 4 March 2013, two Villa fans dressed as astronauts were caught on camera holding a sign proclaiming that "Benteke is out of this world". Benteke scored a deflected goal in a crucial 2–1 victory at Reading, scoring the clubs 1000th goal in the Premier League in the process. The following week he went on to score yet another crucial goal that sealed a 3–2 win over Queens Park Rangers. He then scored the third goal to seal a vital 3–1 win against relegation rivals Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Benteke was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year after his excellent debut season, eventually finishing as runner-up to eventual double award winner Gareth Bale. On 29 April, Benteke put in a world class performance by scoring his first hat-trick for Villa in a 6–1 thrashing of Sunderland. These goals also saw him exceed Dwight Yorke's record for most Premier League goals in a season (18) and pass the 20 goal mark in all competitions, becoming the first player to do so for Villa since Juan Pablo Ángel in the 2003–04 season.On 11 May, Benteke Scored Villa's only goal in a 1–2 loss to Chelsea but in the second half he was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for a high boot on John Terry, meaning he would miss the last game of the season. Benteke finished his first season in England, with an impressive 19 goals in thePremier League and 23 overall. This led to speculation about where the Belgian's future lied, with a host of teams across Europe being linked to the striker.
2013–14 season.
On 8 July 2013, Benteke alerted the interest of the Premier League's elite by handing in a transfer request. Villa, though, insisted the striker would only be allowed to leave if their valuation (rumoured at £25 million) was met. However on 19 July Benteke withdrew his transfer request, after talks with manager Paul Lambert, and signed a new four-year contract with the club. On his second pre-season appearance, he scored a hat-trick against Crewe Alexandra in a 5–1 victory. He finished pre-season with 7 goals in 5 appearances, including two goals against Málaga at Villa Park.
On 17 August 2013, Benteke scored twice, one penalty and one headed goal via a rebound from a missed penalty, in Villa's 3–1 away-win against Arsenal on the opening day of the season.
Four days later, Benteke scored against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a 2–1 defeat. He scored his fourth goal in as many games, as Villa comfortably beat League One side Rotherham United 3–0 in the League Cup second round. He continued scoring, as he racked up his fifth goal in all competitions, against Newcastle United in a 1–2 defeat at Villa Park. However his brilliant early season form was abruptly ended, as he was injured in the next match against Norwich City. It was later confirmed that he would be out for up to six weeks with a hip flexor injury. However he made his comeback earlier than expected, after coming on as a substitute against Tottenham Hotspur a month later (20 October) in a 2–0 defeat.
After loss of form and niggling injuries prevented Benteke scoring for 12 games (his last goal being against Newcastle on 14 September), he eventually ended his drought against Arsenal in a 1–2 defeat on 13 January 2014. He followed this up with goals in back-to-back games against Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion, in a 2–2 draw and 4–3 victory respectively.
International career.
He was member for the Belgium U17 team at 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup in South Korea where he played 3 games and scored 1 goal.
On 19 May 2010 he made his midfield début for the Belgian national team in a friendly match against Bulgaria in Brussels after his former coach at Kortrijk, Georges Leekens, became national coach. On 15 August 2012 he scored his first goal in a 4–2 win against the Netherlands. Since then, he has become a regular starter with the Belgian national team.

Battle of Hysiae

The term Battle of Hysiae refers to two battles at the ancient location of Hysiae (), located to the southwest of Argos, near the modern village of Achladokampos. The first battle took place in 669/8 BC, another in 417 BC. Both were battles between Sparta and Argos.
First battle.
The first Battle of Hysiae is described by the ancient travel-writer Pausanias (2.24.7), who writes as follows:
The chronology of Pausanias would suggest that the battle was fought in 669/8 BC. All that is known is that the Argives defeated the Lacedaemonians. Some (Andrewes) have suggested that this Argive defeat of Sparta occurred when Pheidon was king (or tyrant) of Argos, since Pheidon was famed for his military success and daring, but this remains conjectural. Some scholars (Kelly, Hall) have suggested that the first battle of Hysiae was invented by the Argives.
Second battle.
The second battle took place during the Peloponnesian War. It is described by the historians Thucydides (5.83.2), who actually fought in the war, and Diodorus (12.81.1), who wrote in the 1st century BC, over two hundred years later. Thucydides says that the Spartans marched against Argos in the winter of 418-417 BC with all their allies, but failed to take the city of Argos. The Spartans did, however, capture the Argive town of Hysiae, taking all the male citizens as hostages. The hostages were subsequently killed.

Roy LoPresti

LeRoy Patrick "Roy" LoPresti (June 9, 1929 - August 7, 2002) was an eclectic American aeronautical engineer. He worked on projects as diverse as the Apollo Moon Program and missile design, served as advisor to the US Congress, became known as "Mr. Fast" in the general aviation field, and created an aircraft manufacturing, design and support company which is still in existence.
LoPresti designed the Grumman American AA-5, was Chief Engineer and Vice President of Engineering at Mooney where he designed the Mooney 201, and worked at both Beech Aircraft and Piper Aircraft before starting his own company, "LoPresti Speed Merchants". "Speed Merchants" is presently in the process of obtaining FAA certification of the LoPresti Fury.
Biography.
Roy LoPresti was born to Agnes LaRusso LoPresti and Patrick LoPresti in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. While attending New York University as an Aeronautical Engineering student Roy won a Chance Vought Design Award for "Best Student Light Airplane Design". 
LoPresti graduated in 1950 and obtained employment with Grumman Aerospace on Long Island, New York, but was soon called to serve in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. He became a pilot in the Air Force, serving a total of six years. During the Korean War he met and married Margaret "Peggy" LoPresti (1952). They would eventually have five children, a daughter and four sons. After his wartime service he returned to work at Wright Field on fighter design (flying and designing), a job he stated was "made in heaven."
When he returned to Grumman LoPresti worked on missile designs, but was later put in charge of design at their recently acquired American Aviation division in Cleveland, Ohio. American Aircraft was the current holder of the Bede BD-1 design rights, after Jim Bede had been forced from the company. The BD-1 had promise, but required numerous fixes that American couldn't afford on their own. LoPresti redesigned the aircraft and produced the famed Grumman American AA-5 and its derivatives. He stayed at Grumman for 16 years, during which time he worked on the Apollo Lunar Module, among other projects.
During the 1970s he moved to Mooney Aircraft where he worked lead an aerodynamic cleanup of he M20F Executive and called it the Mooney 201. Starting with the already stretched frame of the M20F, LoPresti improved the aerodynamics via a more slanted windshield, sleeker cowling, and some other minor cleanup items. It was the first aircraft to achieve 200mph (201mph top speed) on 200HP. He also led design of the 201's larger cousins, the 231, 252 and 301.
In a 1979 interview, LoPresti predicted that by the year 2000, most general aviation aircraft would be essentially unchanged in airframe and powerplants. He felt radical new designs and materials would not be marketable and only a few examples would be produced.
He then moved on to become the Vice President of Engineering at Beech Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas, to lead development of the unconventional Beech Starship. As the Starship program ran down the general aviation market was in a process of rapidly downsizing, and LoPresti became increasingly frustrated as he was put into a series of management positions making missiles and bombs. When he expressed his frustration to his wife, she advised him to quit.
In 1987 LoPresti took her advice and joined Piper Aircraft in Vero Beach, Florida. Piper's new parent, Romeo Charley, had recently restructured the company from bankruptcy, and was looking for new products. They were contacted by the Swift Museum Foundation, seeking someone to produce the Globe Swift with a variety of upgrades that had been incorporated by its users over the years. The project was put under LoPriesti's care, and the SwiftFire and SwiftFury designs emerged. They showed the prototype at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in 1988 and returned with 131 orders, each with a $10,000 deposit.
In spite of this promising start, Piper went bankrupt in 1991, leading to a huge legal squabble over the rights to the designs. LoPresti formed LoPresti Speed Merchants as an upgrade firm, making modifications to existing aircraft to make them fly faster. They also created a large fixed base operation in Florida. The company finally gained the rights to build the upgraded Globe Swift, which is now called the LoPresti Fury.
During the 1980s LoPresti served on the Aeronautical Advisory Committee to the US Congress. In 1990 he received the "Godfrey L. Talbot Trophy" for outstanding contributions to the science of aerospace engineering, from the Aero Club of New England.
LoPresti was climbing a ladder to clear leaves from his house's rain gutter when he slipped and fell. He died 35 days later (07 August 2002) of complications from the fall.

<doc id="19562661" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19562661" title="Operation Bulbasket">
Operation Bulbasket

Operation "Bulbasket" was an operation by 'B' Squadron, 1st Special Air Service (SAS), behind the German lines in German occupied France, between June and August 1944. The operation was located to the east of Poitiers in the Vienne department of south west France; its objective was to block the Paris to Bordeaux railway line near Poitiers and to hamper German reinforcements heading towards the Normandy beachheads especially the 2nd SS Panzer Division - "Das Reich".
During the course of the operation amongst other things, the SAS men discovered the whereabouts of a petrol supply train, which was destined for the 2nd SS Panzer Division. The supply train was destroyed by Royal Air Force bombers the same night.
The Special Air Service team had made their base near Verrieres, the location of which was betrayed to the Germans. In the follow-up attack on their camp, 33 men from the Special Air Service were captured and later murdered together with one American Air Force pilot who had fallen in with them, after bailing out of his P-51 Mustang. Seven captured "Maquisards" were also executed in the woods after the attack. Three other SAS men, who had been wounded in the fight and taken to hospital, were murdered by lethal injections while in their hospital beds.
Background.
The men involved in Operation "Bulbasket" were part of the Special Air Service Brigade. It was a unit of the British Army, formed in July 1941 by David Stirling and originally called 'L' Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade; 'L' being an attempt at deception, implying the existence of numerous such units. It was conceived as a commando type force intending to operate behind enemy lines in the North African Campaign. In 1944 the Special Air Service Brigade was formed and consisted of the British 1st and 2nd Special Air Service, the French 3rd and 4th SAS and the Belgian 5th SAS. They were to undertake parachute operations behind the German lines in France and then carry out operations supporting the Allied advance through Belgium, the Netherlands and eventually into Germany.
In May 1944 the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) had issued an order for the Special Air Service Brigade to carry out two operations in France, "Hounsworth" in the area of Dijon for 'A' Squadron and "Bulbasket", near Poitiers, which was given to 'B' Squadron.
The focus of both operations would be the disruption of German reinforcements from the south of France to the Normandy beachheads. To carry out the operation the men were to destroy supply dumps, block the Paris to Bordeaux railway line near Poitiers and attack railway sidings and fuel trains. One formation they especially wanted to delay was the 2nd SS Panzer Division - "Das Reich" which was based in the area around Toulouse in the south of France. The intelligence experts at SHAEF responsible for planning the Normandy landings, had estimated it would take three days for the panzer division to reach Normandy.
The officer in command of 'B' Squadron was Captain John Tonkin of the Royal Marines with Second Lieutenant Richard Crisp as his second in command; both men were briefed on the operation by SHAEF in London 1 June 1944. Over the next two days they spent time at the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive who had agents of 'F' section operating in the area under the command of Captain Maingard, alias 'Samuel'. He also had links with the two main French Resistance groups in the area the Francs tireurs et Partisans and the Armée Secrète. Tonkin was also given a list of rail targets by Headquarters Special Air Service.
Mission.
The advance party for Operation "Bulbasket", including Tonkin, were flown to France by a Handley Page Halifax belonging to 'B' Flight, No. 161 Squadron RAF, the special duties squadron. Their drop zone was an area of the Brenne marsh south west of Châteauroux, which they reached at 01:37 hours on 6 June 1944. On the ground to meet them was their SOE contact, Captain Maingard. Two further groups from 'B' Squadron were parachuted in, one on 7 June and the second on 11 June. Also dropped at the same time were Vickers K machine gun armed Jeeps.
Once on the ground, the SAS Squadron set about preventing German reinforcements reaching Normandy. They attacked the rail network, laid mines, conducted vehicle patrols in their Jeeps and trained members of the French Resistance. On 10 June a French railwayman informed Tonkin that a train composed of at least eleven petrol tankers was parked at the rail sidings at Châtellerault. These were the fuel reserves for the advancing 2nd SS Panzer Division. To confirm their location, Tonkin sent Lieutenant Tomos Stephens on a reconnaissance of the area. Travelling alone by bicycle, Stephens made the round trip - returning on 11 June. He confirmed the location of the petrol train. He also reported that it was too heavily guarded for the SAS squadron to deal with. Tonkin contacted England and requested an air attack on the train. That night a force of 12 Royal Air Force de Havilland Mosquito bombers, six each from No. 138 Wing RAF, based at RAF Lasham and 140 Wing, based at Gravesend in Kent, attacked the train in its sidings. The mission was a success. 
To prevent their camp being located or compromised by German radio direction finding equipment or informers, Tonkin regularly moved its location. The location of new camps had to be close to water and a drop zone for parachute supply. The camp located near to Verrières was near to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson and had an adequate water supply. The SAS Squadron had been at Verrières between 25 June and 1 July. The local population had also become aware of the camp and Tonkin was warned by Maingard that if the locals knew, informers would soon tell the Germans. Tonkin ordered the squadron to move to a new camp just south in the bois des Cartes. This new camp was also close to their drop zone at La Font d'Usson where they were expecting a supply drop over the night of 3/4 July. On their arrival at the new camp at Bois des Cartes, the water supply from a well failed and Tonkin decided to return to Verrières until a more suitable camp site could be found.
German attack.
The German SS Security Police had been informed that the SAS camp was located in a forest near Verrières. On 1 July they had sent agents into the forest to attempt to locate the camp and assembled an attacking force based on the reserve battalion of the 17th "SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen" which was based at Bonneuil-Matours. With the arrival of the SAS Squadron back at their old base camp, Tonkin set out on 2 July to try and locate a new camp. He returned in the early hours of 3 July just before the Germans attacked, who had managed to surround the camp during the night. The force in the forest camp consisted of 40 SAS men, a United States Army Air Forces North American P-51 Mustang pilot, Second Lieutenant Lincoln Bundy, who had been shot down 10 June 1944 and had fallen in with the SAS, and nine men from the French Resistance.
The Germans attacked at dawn and it was all over by 14:00. As the Germans searched the forest the SAS men tried to break out. A party of 34 were moving down a forest track when they were ambushed and captured. The leader of the party, Lieutenant Tomos Stephens, was beaten to death by a German officer using a rifle butt; seven captured "Maquisards" were executed in the woods. The SAS men and the American pilot should have been treated as prisoners of war. However, their fate was determined by the issue of the Commando Order by Adolf Hitler which called for the execution of commandos. The decision of who was going to execute them was the cause of an argument between the German Army and the SS. It was decided that the army would carry out the execution. On 7 July, the surviving prisoners of war, 30 SAS men and Second Lieutenant Bundy, were taken into the woods near to St Sauvant, forced to dig their own graves then executed by a German firing squad at dawn under the command of SS Major Josef Kieffer. Their bodies were then buried in a mass grave. Three Special Air Service men who had been wounded and hospitalized were killed by the administration of lethal injections. The 34 men executed in the woods were re-interred in the village cemetery of Rom, Deux-Sèvres. The bodies of the three men executed in the hospital have never been found, but they are commemorated by a plaque among their comrades' headstones in Rom.
Reprisal attack by the RAF.
One of the UK Special Forces' "Jedburgh" teams (codenamed "Hugh") operating in the area, reported back to Special Forces HQ, requesting a reprisal attack on the headquarters of the 17th SS "Panzergrenadier" Division in Bonneuil-Matours. On receipt of this request, Special Forces HQ passed it on to SAS Brigade HQ, who contacted No. 2 Group RAF, part of the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force. 2 Group's Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshall Basil Embry assigned the reprisal attack operation to No. 140 Wing RAF, which had already responded to "Bulbasket"'s request for the attack on the supply trains in Châtellerault in the previous month. By this time, No. 140 Wing was operating out of RAF Thorney Island, where, on 14 July 1944, Embry personally briefed the 14 crews selected for this operation. The plan of attack called for four phases: Four Mosquitos would drop high explosive bombs; following them, six aircraft would drop American M76 incendiary bombs; the remaining aircraft would then drop more HE bombs and finally the aircraft would return to strafe the target before returning to base. 
The Mosquitos left RAF Thorney Island at about 21:00 hours, met up with an escort of 12 Mustang Mk. IIIs for the daylight crossing, at low level, of enemy-held territory in Northern France and reached the target at approximately 21:00 local time, when the German troops were eating their evening meal. The attack went as planned and all seven barrack blocks were destroyed; local estimates of the number of German troops killed varied from 80 to about 200. All aircraft safely returned to Thorney Island in the early hours of 15 July.
Withdrawal.
Tonkin and the remainder of the SAS Squadron (altogether eight survivors of the attack and three others, who had been away on a smaller operation at the time) escaped, regrouped and carried on with the mission until the order to cease operations was received on 24 July 1944. During the period between 10 June and 23 July, the SAS Squadron had attacked railway targets 15 times, the main roads Route nationale 10 south of Vivonne and the Route nationale N147 between Angers– Poitiers–Limoges were mined. They also had some success attacking targets of opportunity. Over the night of 12/13 June 1944 Lieutenant Crisp, one of those later executed, was in command of a patrol that laid mines on the N147 in the Forêt de Défant, just before the 2nd SS Panzer Division arrived in the area.
The 2nd SS Panzer Division, during their advance to Normandy, was responsible for the Tulle murders on 9 June 1944 and the massacre at the village of Oradour-sur-Glane on 10 June. The operations by the "Bulbasket" team, amongst others, delayed the arrival of the division in Normandy until the end of June. The 2nd SS Panzer Division was responsible for the capture of the Special Operations Executive agent Violette Szabo on 10 June 1944. They handed her over to the "Sicherheitsdienst" security police in Limoges.
Aftermath.
In December 1944, after the German Army had been driven from the area, men working in the forest near St Sauvant discovered an area of broken branches and disturbed earth. They started to examine the site and discovered what remained of a number of bodies. The local police force were informed and on 18 December started excavating the grave. A number of corpses were still wearing Allied uniform; most of their identity tags had been removed but two remained which identified them as members of Operation "Bulbasket", while another was identified by his name inside the battle dress tunic. A further body in civilian clothing was identified as that of Second Lieutenant Bundy.
The 31 bodies were taken to Rom and reburied with full military honours in the village cemetery. The body of Lieutenant Stephens, who had been beaten to death, is in the village cemetery in Verrières. The bodies of the three men murdered in hospital, despite not being found, were commemorated with a memorial plaque which was erected beside the Special Air Service graves in Rom cemetery.
Summary of the operation.
In an analysis of the achievements of Operation "Bulbasket", the author Paul McCue lists the following:

Konstantin Kobets

Konstantin Ivanovich Kobets (; 16 July 1939 in Kiev; 31 December 2012) was a Russian Army General. In early 1991 he was serving as Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff for communications.
Kobets supported then President of the RSFSR Boris Yeltsin during the August coup of 1991. From August 19 until September 9, 1991, Konstantin Kobets was Defense Minister of the RSFSR (albeit there was no ministry). This post was then abolished.
He was chair of the Russian Government's military reform committee in late 1991. In that position he developed a plan for the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States Armed Forces. This plan was presented to a council of defence officials of the Soviet republics on 26–27 December 1991. However it was not adopted by the meeting and was superseded in any case by the effective breakup of the former Soviet Armed Forces among the former republics of the Soviet Union.
From September 1992 Kobets was Chief Military Inspector of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, and from January 1995 he was Secretary of State - Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation.
He was sentenced to two years in prison in 1997 for corruption and misuse of defense ministry funds.

The Split Second

The Split Second is the second novel in The Seems series. It was published by Bloomsbury Publishing and written by John Hulme and Michael Wexler. It follows Becker Drane, a Fixer for The Seems on a Mission to retrieve a Second. A Second is a mineral in The Seems which provides Time for our World. The Seems is a parallel universe in charge of providing our World with what it needs to keep on going.
Plot.
The second book follows Becker Drane on another mission. At the end of the first book, "The Glitch in Sleep", it was revealed 50 trays of Frozen Moments were stolen. With that, a Time Bomb could be constructed causing great damage to The World. When news show the Time Bomb has been found in the Department of Time, Lucien Chiappa is sent in to Fix it, until the bomb explodes and Becker is called in to repair the mess by bringing the two parts of the bomb together so no Essence (liquid that everything to age much faster) can enter the World.
To Fix the Second, Becker must bring both halves of the Second together again to prevent any more Essence from dripping out. The first is found in a basement and the second is found to be trapped by the Tide, the organization who created the bomb and wants to overthrow the current order of the Seems and create a new world.
A legendary Fixer thought to be dead, Tom Jackal arrives to help Becker and manages to capture the Second and put it together, but the Essence has soaked through their Sleeves (lightweight bodysuits) and causes him to age. Tom dies from overexposure, but saves the World.
At the end, Becker breaks the Golden Rule which prevents him from meeting with Jenifer Kaley, whose Case File (documents on her private life) was given to Becker after the Mission. However, in the epilogue, the Time Being, a powerful founder of the Seems agrees to join The Tide.
Themes.
The main theme in "The Split Second" as a reviewer noted is how, "the Seemsians, especially our protagonist Becker Drane, have strong ethics, remain true to their goals and doing the right thing, and they understand and buy into doing your part for society and following the rules that accompany life." This is a common problem for Becker as he has broken many of the Rules by the end of the book such as the Golden Rule which is also known as the "'granddady of them all"
Critical reception.
"The Split Second" received positive reviews. A review from the School Library Journal in the audio book criticized Oliver Wyman's narration, but praised the books "many hilarious wordplays and puns". It also commented on the book's complex plot and many varying viewpoints. A review from Booklist was very positive stating "This sequel continues to develop a truly ingenious setting while proving every bit as much of a nail-biter as the first"."The Split Second" was also ranked fifth for the 20 best books for middle schoolers in 2008 by reviewer Peter Glassman. He called the book "ingenious, wildly inventive, laugh out loud funny, touching and poignant at times" Kirkus Reviews was not as positive saying, "Heartwarming fluff follows predictable story lines with original and silly set-dressing".

Levoča, Spiš Castle and the associated cultural monuments

The ruins of Spiš Castle is one of the largest castle sites in Central Europe. The castle is situated above the town of Spišské Podhradie and the village of Žehra that with adjacent ecclesiastical town Spišská Kapitula form components of the UNESCO World Heritage site. In 2009, the site was extended to include the famous altar by Master Paul of Levoča and the historic centre of Levoča with many well preserved Renaissance buildings.
Spiš Castle.
Built in the 12th century, it was the political, administrative, economic and cultural centre of Szepes county. Before 1464, it was owned by Hungarian kings, afterwards (until 1528) by the Szapolyai family, the Thurzo family (1531-1635), the Csáky family (1638-1945), аnd (since 1945) by the state.
Originally a Romanesque stone castle with fortifications, a two-story Romanesque palace and a three nave Romanesque-Gothic basilica were constructed in the area by the second half of the 13th century. A second extramural settlement was built in the 14th century, which doubled the castle area. The castle was completely rebuilt in the 15th century. The castle walls were heightened and a third extramural settlement was constructed. A late Gothic chapel was added around 1470. The Szapolyai clan performed late Gothic transformations, which made the upper castle into a comfortable family residence, typical of late Renaissance residences of the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1780, the castle burned down and has been in ruins ever since. The castle was partly reconstructed in the second half of the 20th century, and extensive archaeological research was carried out on the site.
Levoča.
The old medieval town of the Levoča (Hungarian: "Lőcse", German: "Leutschau") is still surrounded by most of its 2,5 km long city walls. The main entrance to the old town is via the monumental Košice Gate, with the other two preserved namely Menhard, and the Polish Gate. The town square boasts three major monuments:
The square is very well preserved and contains a number of striking buildings which were the town-houses of the local nobility in the late Middle Ages. Also notable in the square is the wrought-iron 'Cage of Shame', dating back to the 17th century, used for public punishment of miscreants. A plaque on one of the houses records the printing and publication in the town of the most famous work of Comenius, the Orbis Pictus. The second biggest church in Slovakia, the Church of St. James from the 14th century, houses a magnificent late-Gothic wooden carved altar, officially the highest Gothic wooden altar in the World (18.62 m high), created by Master Paul around 1520.
Spišská Kapitula.
This is an exceptionally well-preserved ecclesiastical town overlooking the Spiš Castle. The town consists of the Cathedral of St. Martin, a former monastery, a seminary, and a single street with some 30 houses, all of medieval construction and enclosed by a wall build between 1662 and 1665 with Upper and Lower Gates. The cathedral was built between 1245 and 1273 in the Romanesque style with subsequent Gothic extensions. It is one of the largest and most interesting Romanesque monuments in Slovakia. It contains many mediaeval carved altars and is the resting place of many lords of Spiš Castle. Its wall paintings from 1317 depict the coronation of king Charles Robert of Anjou.
Frescos in a church in Žehra.
The Church of Holy Spirit at Žehra dates from 1274 and contains wall paintings of the 13th and 14th centuries.
Spišské Podhradie.
The town situated at the foot of the hill of Spiš Castle contains a number of Renaissance merchants' houses. It also has one of the few remaining synagogue buildings (now disused) in the region.
