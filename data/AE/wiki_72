Ecclesia in Asia

Ecclesia in Asia is a document issued by Pope John Paul II to serve as a blueprint for the expansion of the Roman Catholic faith in Asia. It summarises ideas and conclusions of the Special Asian Synod held in Rome from April 18 to May 14, 1998. It was officially promulgated by John Paul II in New Delhi, India on November 6, 1999.
The document stated that "just as in the first millennium the Cross was planted on the soil of Europe, and in the second on that of the Americas and Africa, we can pray that in the Third Christian Millennium a great harvest of faith will be reaped in this vast and vital continent of Asia" (EA 1) (JP II 1999:359). 
The Exhortation is composed of seven parts dealing with the following themes: the Asian context, Jesus as Savior, the Holy Spirit as Lord and Giver of life, proclamation of Jesus in Asia (with a focus on inculturation), communion and dialogue for mission (with a focus on ecumenical and interreligious dialogue), the service of human promotion, and Christians as witnesses to the Gospel.
The long document concludes as "The peoples of Asia need Jesus Christ and his Gospel. Asia is thirsting for the Living water that Jesus alone can give (cf. Jn 4:10-15). The disciples of Christ in Asia must therefore be unstinting in their efforts to fulfil the mission they have received from the Lord, who has promised to be with them to the end of the age (cf. Mt 28:20). Trusting in the Lord who will not fail those whom he has called, the Church in Asia joyfully makes her pilgrim way into the Third Millennium."

Ben (comic strip)

Ben is a syndicated comic strip that is seen in Canada, but is also included in American and other English-speaking newspapers. There is also a French version that is likewise growing in popularity. It is the creation of artist and author Daniel Shelton.
Its storylines primarily involve Ben Hatley, a recent retiree from Oshawa, Ontario, along with his wife Olivia, whom he lovingly calls "Liv", their daughter Patty Tokoname, her husband Nathan and his parents, who live in Vancouver, British Columbia, and their two children Nicholas and Michael. They also have two more kids, named Alec and Mia.
Although the main character is a retiree, the comic strip prefers not to limit itself to the typical senior citizen stereotypes, opting instead to show seniors as modern and vibrant.

Soulbringer

Soulbringer is a fantasy RPG developed by Infogrames and Gremlin Entertainment. Published and released by Interplay on June 30, the game received lackluster reviews and was not a great seller for Interplay. It was later packed and shipped in combination with Interplay's .
Plot.
It starts off with the story of a young man arriving in a town called Madrigal to find his uncle Andrus, who is the man's only remaining family member after his father died. However, the protagonist is soon caught in the middle of strange bandit activity around town and then drawn into escallating political and supernatural strife across the world. During the game, it is revealed that the hero is a reincarnation of a powerful being whose purpose is to defeat a group of ancient demons known as Revenants. Even though forgotten, the Revenants are secretly standing behind all major conflicts and problems encountered. The hero has to reawaken his past-life powers, travel to parallel worlds and ultimately trap the Revenants within the mystical Well of Souls.
The game includes both a good and an evil ending.
Gameplay.
The game is 3D with a helicopter POV
For the combat system, each weapon has a set of possible moves, with more powerful moves becoming available as points are put into the "combat" skill.
The game includes a novel magic system. Rather than having reflexively opposing categories of magic, Soulbringer's magic system is circular: Air suppresses earth, which suppresses spirit which suppresses water, which suppresses fire, which suppresses air. Considerable strategy is thus needed to achieve a desired balance within the elements.
Spells are obtained from spellbooks that are unlocked by runes; more powerful spells become accessible as points are put into the "magic" skill. A spell's power depends on your magic skill and on your strength within the elements that make up the spell.
Each move and spell requires a certain amount of time to prepare and execute (including drawing the weapon, if necessary) Motion capture was used to display such actions for added realism. Soulbringer also takes terrain and placement into account (e.g. spiders on the ground can only be hit by "low" attacks while an enemy soldier higher up on a hill can only be hit by "high" attacks)
Combinations of attacks and spells can be preset and assigned to a hot key.

Przybyszów (, "Prybyshiv"; , "Prybyshiv") is a former village in the administrative district of Gmina Bukowsko, within Sanok County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It lies approximately south of Bukowsko, south-west of Sanok, and south of the regional capital Rzeszów.
History.
The village was established in 1553, and there were several subsequent waves of settlement, notably in the years 1589, 1699, and 1748. The name "Przybyszow" derives from a word meaning "newcomer" or "stranger". The village was located on land previously owned by the Polish nobleman Nicholas Herburt Odnowski since 1539 (More history, in Polish, about Odnowski can be found at this link
In the year 1898 the village had 393 inhabitants and 62 houses, the village area was 6.37 km ². It was owned at that time by a Polish noble family named Scibor-Rylski. From November 1918 to January 1919 it was part of the Komańcza Republic .
The village ceased to exist after World War II, when the entire population was deported to Ukraine as part of Soviet and Polish population exchange operations. (UPA sotnias (units) had been stationed in this village, and the village was subsequently burned.) None of the original structures exist, although excavation would likely reveal their foundations.
Names.
Przybyszow, meaning “Outsiders” or “Newcomers” – A now non-existent village in the municipality Bukowsko in Sanok County, Subcarpathian province of Southeast Poland.
Residents.
The surnames of the inhabitants of Przybyszow during the nineteenth century include: Bąk, Chomik, Gajdosz, Gulicz, Homerda, Jurnak, Kalimun, Kiryk, Kuzyna, Krupa, Moskal, Moczków, Nimec, Ogrodnik, Osiurak, Paszkiewicz, Popowicz, Priatka, Proper, Stefura, Swider, Turnak, Volians'kyj/Wolański, Wołoszynowski. (More surnames to be added later.)
Architecture.
The village is located along a stream called Płonka, which is a tributary of the Osława River, bordered on the other side by the village Płonna. Homes were situated along the brook valley, on the northeastern slope of forested mountain range (up Tokarnia 777 m above sea level) forming the watershed between Osława and Wisłok.
Religion.
At the turn of the 20th century, the Lemko residents of the village belonged to the St. Paraskevia Greek Catholic parish in Karlikow (of which Alexei Malarchyk was the priest), although there was a filial (or branch/daughter) church in the village. The smaller village of Wola Piotrowa was also part of that parish. Roman Catholics (Poles) belonged to the Bukowsko parish.

History of trade unions in Poland

The history of trade unions in Poland started in 1869.
The first 120 years 1869-1989.
As in all countries of Central Europe also in Poland trade unions were active since the end of the 19th century, particularly in the Prussian and Austrian partition regions. 1869 the first Trade Union (of a branch) of Mechanical Engineers and Metal Workers in Bromberg. In 1889 the first general ‘Union of Mutual Help’ (ZWP) was founded in the town of Bytom (Beuthen) in Silesia. Some of the historical trade unions maneuvered their way through all system changes, for example today’s biggest affiliated union of the country, namely the Polish Teachers' Union (ZNP) which was established in 1905. Around 1906 there were already over 2000 trade unions gathered in about 30 central associations. Much of the trade union movement was ideologically divided.
After the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 all socio-political organisations, including trade unions, were prohibited by the German occupying forces. Many activists were deported to concentration camps and murdered, others died in the resistance movement. After 1945 the communist system forced all refounded trade unions into line. Regime trade unions became the fundamental element of workers’ organisations, which was also aimed at preventing solidarity in state combines and regions. The aim was to make unions an instrument of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). However, this repeatedly met with violent resistance of the workers in the industrial centres, like in Poznan in 1956, in the northern coastal cities in 1970, in Radom and Ursus in 1976 as well as at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk in 1980. The most significant result was the foundation of the Independent Self- governing Trade Union ‘Solidarity’(NSZZ Solidarnosc) in August 1980, a mass organisation with almost 10 million members. This led in autumn 1980 to the self-dissolution of the ‘Central Council of Trade Unions’ (CRZZ) which was subordinated to the PZPR. During Martial Law, which was introduced on 13 December 1981 and lasted until June 1983, Solidarnosc was banned and the controlled refoundation of trade unions dependent on state orders began. In establishments and state combines affiliated unions were founded. Only in 1984 the ‘All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions’ (OPZZ) was set up as an umbrella organisation to coordinate them. The OPZZ received not only all properties of the CRZZ, but also of the banned Solidarnosc.
Development of trade unions and membership after 1989.
After the regime changes of the year 1989 OPZZ remained the strongest trade union federation, but like all other trade unions it recorded a dramatical decrease in membership. While in the middle of the nineties about 4.5 million people were members of OPZZ, this number fell to under 2 million by the year 2001 and it is estimated that in 2007 there were less than 750.000 members. At the beginning of 2002 a new trade union federation split away from OPZZ, namely the FZZ Forum with 515.000 members mainly from civil service, local governments, railways, energy, mines and other state-owned enterprises. In autumn 1981 ten million people belonged to NSZZ Solidarnosc, but after its second legalization in April 1989 it did not manage to regain its previous significance and number of members. While in 2001 there still were about 1.1 million members, in December 2005 there were only 721.8561. At the same time there are drastic differences between state enterprises and civil service, where about 28 per cent of employees belong to trade unions, and the private sector, where only 3 per cent are organised in trade unions2. From 1982 until 2005 the overall degree of unionization fell from 80 per cent to below 14 per cent. This dramatic decline lead to Poland being one of the EU-countries with the lowest degree of unionization. Most of the trade unions’ members (51.7 per cent) are women, especially in the educational sector, health and civil services, but also 35 per cent of members of mining trade unions are female. Only 2.4 per cent of employees under the age of 25 belong to a trade union.

The reasons for this rapid deterioration are essentially as follows4:
- massive shrinkage of traditional industries and sectors, such as mining and steel,
- in privatised establishments (“brownfield investment”) with over 250 employees trade
unions mostly remained, in mid-sized establishments about one third remained. In
small establishments there are almost no trade unions,
- new private enterprises (“greenfield investments”): among big enterprises only 5 per cent of Polish establishments and 33 per cent of foreign establishments have trade unions, in mid-sized and small establishments there are practically no trade unions,
- technology-orientated undertakings like those in the IT-branch with their young staff, who often have academic degrees, have almost no unionization,
- due to high unemployment, which in some regions reaches 30 per cent and in the whole country 12 per cent (November 2007), many employees are afraid of founding or joining a trade union.
The role of trade unions in Polish politics after the transformation 1989.
From its beginning in August 1980 Solidarność was not only a trade union but also a political movement. Many later political groupings and parties stem from this environment. All in all 23 political parties had their roots and leaders linked to Solidarność, amongst them today’s biggest governing party ‘Civic Platform’ (PO) and the biggest opposition party ‘Law and Justice’ (PiS). Although the relations between political parties and trade unions used to be close, this decreased after 2000, but is still visible. Solidarność sympathises with the conservative parties of the national catholic right-wing, whereas OPZZ tends towards alliances with the post-communist Left.
During the transformation period national trade unions were highly politicised. Lech Wałęsa, the first chairman of Solidarność became president of Poland in 1990 and many trade union members held government offices and seats in Parliament and on management boards of big state-owned companies. As a result Solidarność gained enormous influence, but as a trade union simultaneously lost most of its leaders to politics. This led to a loss of authority of Solidarność as an institution representing workers’ interests and separated it away from its grass roots members.
In the parliamentary elections in 1997 one of the parties running for parliament was the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), a political party coalition gathered around Solidarność. It consisted of 20 small parties and 16 further groupings. AWS became by far the biggest party with almost 34 per cent of valid votes and gained 201 seats in the Sejm (out of 460), as well as 51 out of 100 seats in the Senate and thus had the absolute majority in the second chamber of the Polish parliament. Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek as well as most of the AWS ministers came from the trade union. The trade union’s chairman Marian Krzaklewski (from February 1991 until September 2002) was simultaneously chairman of the AWS and its parliamentary grouping in the Sejm. His most important collaborators came from the trade union’s National Commission and took part in negotiations even when they were not members of parliament. Consequently Krzaklewski – as chairman of the trade union, of the party and of the parliamentary grouping – and the members of the trade union’s National Commission became an extra-parliamentary centre of influence.
The ‘rule of trade unions’ ended in the year 2001. Due to conflicts within the party and accusations of corruption AWS became unattractive and weak in the eyes of the electorate. In the parliamentary elections of 2001 it did not manage to get over the legal hurdle of 8 per cent of votes for electoral coalitions and since then has not had a single parliamentarian in the Sejm. Now came the time of the coalition of the Left led by the ‘Democratic Left Alliance’ (SLD), where many parliamentarians came from OPZZ. In 2005 ‘Law and Justice’, a party very near to Solidarność, and its partners removed the Left Alliance which was related to OPZZ. After the September 2005 and October 2007 elections seven parliamentarians from the OPZZ still belonged to left alliances.
The structural reforms of the nineties lead to the impoverishment of certain parts of the society, to dismissals and growing unemployment, for which not only the government but also the trade unions were blamed. Their direct engagement in Polish politics had produced negative effects. Due to their participation in less than pristine governments trade unions almost forfeited their reputation and support. Nevertheless a large part of the leaders and members believe until today that in order to achieve something in politics one has to use one’s own people. The trade union Solidarność openly favours the ‘Law and Justice’ party PiS. During the presidential elections in 2005 it intensively called on the electorate to vote for PiS candidate Lech Kaczyński. The weekly newspaper ‘Tygodnik Solidarność’ constantly supported the policy of PiS which governed from 2005 to 2007 with the rural interest party Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona) and the extreme right-wing League of Polish Families (LPR).
Even the hitherto neutral Trade Unions Forum was close to getting involved with political parties. In June 2005 its board decided to sign an agreement with the populist Samoobrona. However, already in August 2005 FZZ annulled this agreement, because Samoobrona did not grant FZZ the promised places on the electoral lists for the parliamentary elections in 2005.
Current situation of Polish trade unions.
The landscape of Polish trade unions is shaped by three national umbrella organisations, many autonomous organisations on the local level (i.e. ‘Sierpien 80’, Solidarnosc 80, etc.) as well as independent trade unions in individual plants and firms. All Polish trade unions accept the social market economy, parliamentary democracy and European unification.
All trade unions, including NSZZ Solidarnosc, used their old structures to deal with new tasks and challenges during the transformation period after 1989. Despite numerous attempts at reforms all umbrella organisations, as well as most sector unions, suffer because of these dysfunctional structures. Reform of structures has become a magic formula present at all congresses and in programmatic documents in many variations, but that does not result in any significant changes. Although they support political reforms, trade unions are conservative and resistant to reform when it comes to their own organisational structures and finances. The structure of the sector organisations reflects the Polish state-owned economic structures from the beginning of the eighties and not the realities of today’s globalised market economy and precarious labour markets. The borders of local structures often do not follow the local government reorganisations which have taken place in the meantime.
NSZZ Solidarnosc, founded in 1980 and again in 1989, consists of 37 regions and 16 affiliated sectoral unions. Since September 2002 its leader is Janusz Sniadek. OPZZ was established in 1984 and consists of 90 craft unions grouped in 9 sector committees and of 16 regional boards in voivodeships. Since May 2004 its leader is Jan Guz. FZZ Forum was established in 2002, consists of 77 craft unions grouped in 8 branches and is led by Wieslaw Siewierski.
The Catholic Church and particularly the admiration of the Polish pope John Paul II. have profoundly shaped NSZZ Solidarnosc. During the 20th National Congress of Solidarnosc in summer 2006 typically there was an appeal in memory of pope John Paul II. During the first visit of pope Benedict XVI strikes in health care and in other sectors in the whole country were stopped in order not to disturb the distinguished guest and to enable members of the Solidarnosc to participate in the services with the pope.
NSZZ Solidarnosc, OPZZ and FZZ Forum together have about 1.9 million members. It is supposed that a further 200.000 members belong to small independent trade unions. Statistics are rarely published and are extremely difficult to prepare anyway, due to the huge fragmentation and insufficient links between organisational levels. The overwhelming part of the basic trade unions are ‘plant social clubs’ or even ‘functional groups’ for administration, sales, logistics, foremen, technicians, etc.. Some of those ‘plant social clubs’ function only in their own departments or sites and know only little about trade union work in other locations of the enterprise. Cooperation in trade union networks for entire enterprises and groups of companies is only an exception and takes place with foreign, often German help. The EU- inspired Law on Information and Consultation, passed on the 7th of April 2006, slowly contributes to changing this situation by means of the creation of “Employees Councils”.
The degree of unionization is still exceptionally high in the mining industry, in the metallurgical industry, the railways and in education. Trade unions are present in all state owned mines. Apart from two large trade mining unions affiliated to Solidarnosc and OPZZ, there are independent unions of occupational groups. The degree of unionisation depends on the mine and lies between 70 and 90 per cent.
However, in 97 per cent of all establishments in the country there are no trade unions, especially not in small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs). On the other hand, in the business segment where there are employees’ organisations there are over 23.000 trade unions as legal entities and over 300 industry-wide organisations which aspire to be national confederations of trade unions. All of them are properly registered with the courts. Individual membership in sector unions or nationwide confederations do not exist. The reason for this multitude and variety is a law which imposes only a few numerical limits to the establishment of employee organisations. It takes only 10 employees to register a trade union foundation committee. Enterprises with over five or even over a dozen trade unions are not rare. The record belongs to an establishment with 210 employees and 17 trade unions. Within many firms trade unions cooperate between themselves. Yet it also happens that unions negotiate and sign collective agreements with the employer behind each other’s backs. Even many of the enterprise unions of Solidarnosc do not at the same time belong to sector or craft unions but only to the nationwide association.
Trade unions, if they exist, are generally strongest on the plant or site level where the collection of membership dues takes place. The majority of union funds is also spent on this level. The most transparent finances are those of Solidarnosc. Membership subscriptions are distributed as follows: 60 per cent go to the Plant/Site Commission, 25 per cent to the Regional Board, 8 per cent to the National Commission (umbrella organisation), 5 per cent to the strike fund and 2 per cent to the sector union. OPZZ and FZZ Forum also have great problems with financing their activities. In both cases a part of subscriptions of 7 cent per month and member goes to central offices. This is by far not enough to keep the work of the umbrella organisations on a sufficiently high level. During the last few years especially Solidarnosc and OPZZ were forced to cut down on costs by closing offices and reducing staff. OPZZ seems to be in a better material situation than Solidarnosc, as it took over the larger part of the properties of trade unions dating from before 1989 (urban office properties, sanatoriums and holiday homes) and thus for years functioned on the basis of earnings from renting and leasing them. Some affiliated unions of OPZZ and Forum have similar financial sources as they have their own properties.
Until now the cooperation between trade unions and organisations of civil society was somewhat limited. The generally conservative trade unions are often wary or even mistrustful towards consumer or environmental organisations which follow other aims and sometimes represent contradictory interests. Polish trade unions are also often unable to react to new challenges in good time. Other non-governmental organisations usually react quicker. Some important phenomena of today’s labour market like gender questions, mobbing, interest protection of employees mistreated in big chain stores, temporary work or subcontracted labour became topics of the public debate thanks to civil society, the media and ad hoc socio- political associations. Trade unions initially often showed reserve towards new challenges, and they don’t represent the precariously employed and the unemployed anyway.
Employee councils were established for the first time by the act of 7 April 2006. This act is the implementation of the EU directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees of 11 March 2002. The new employee councils have no rights of co- determination of decisions of management. Where there are no trade unions employee councils may become a preliminary stage to the establishment of trade union organisations in the firms.
International connections of the Polish trade unions.
Since 1986 the NSZZ Solidarnosc belonged to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU, since November 2006 ITUC) and to the World Confederation of Labour (WCL, which in November 2006 became a part of the ITUC), since 1995 to the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), and since 1997 to the Trade Union Advisory Committee of the ‘Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’ (TUAC/OECD). The affiliated unions of the NSZZ Solidarnosc usually belong to the branch offices of the ETUC.
OPZZ belonged from 1984 till 1991 to the communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in Prague. From 1991 till 1997 OPZZ reduced its status to observer. In March 2006 it joined the European Trade Union Confederation after the long-standing quarrel with Solidarnosc concerning real estate was settled. The biggest trade union in the country, the OPZZ member ZNP, belonged to the teachers’ federations of the ICFTU as well as of the WCL. Many other affiliated unions of the OPZZ also belong to the sector branch structures of the ETUC and the ITUC for a long time. Among these are printers, the building branch, forestry, agriculture, mining, chemistry, energy and some public services.

Brummana High School

Brummana High School is a private secondary school in Lebanon. It is located in the village of Brummana, situated in Metn, Mount Lebanon, east of the capital city Beirut.
This school was established in 1873, by the Quaker Theophilus Waldmeier (a Swiss missionary). Historically Quakers were among the pioneers in developing a modern form of learner-centred education which prized the worth and development of the whole child and student. With other educators, Quakers recognised that schooling involved far more than academic study. Today much internationally accepted good practice in education follows these principles. BHS remains a school which aims to follow the ideals and values of its Quaker founders.
Brummana High School has been licensed and accredited by the Lebanese Ministry of Education to be a coeducational, boarding and day school for students in the classes of the infant, primary, intermediate and secondary schools in 1947.
History.
Theophilus Waldmeier, a German-Swiss missionary, first came to Mount Lebanon in 1867, during the time of the Ottoman rule, and was engaged as inspector of branch schools in Beirut, the mountains, and Damascus.
Some time between 1869 and 1874, Elijah G. Saleeby opened the first school in Brummana, a remote village overlooking Beirut (three hours from Beirut on horseback), called the "Darlington Station" because it was backed with Quaker (Religious Society of Friends) subscriptions from Darlington, England.
In 1873, Theophilus Waldmeier opened a girls' school in Brummana, with money sent to him by his friends in Switzerland. Before the end of the year he was sent further money from Switzerland to open a boys' school at Brummana. Many of the buildings of Brummana date to the time period; they were made of local stone and red tile.
In 1874, Theophilus Waldmeier visited England to raise money for the school from the Society of Friends, and he himself became a Quaker. When he returned, he purchased 20,000 square yards of land called "Berket al-Ghanem" (The Pool of the Conqueror) which was a hillside of pine, fig, and mulberry trees with two fountains of water on the edge of Brummana.
The Friends' Syrian Mission (a committee of English and American Friends) approved the purchase and authorised the building of a boys' school. In this same year, Elijah G. Saleeby handed over the "Darlington Station" school to Theophilus Waldmeier.
In 1876, the Boys' Training Home (now Brummana High School) was opened in a leased house in Brummana until the new building was ready. The land name was changed from "Berket al-Ghanem" to "Ayn al-Salam" (The Fountain of Peace). Within five years, the school had grown to 300 students, bringing literacy and new ideas to the isolated mountain area.
When in 1878 the new Boy's Training Home building came into use, it housed the only dispensary in Mount Lebanon. As the medical work increased, in 1881 alternative accommodation was found in an old silk factory which was converted into a hospital with 15 beds on the ground floor and a dispensary and outpatient accommodation in the upper storey.
In 1882, the Girls' Training Home at Brummana was opened.
Education at Brummana High School was based on the principles of the Society of Friends, which stress non-violence, equality, the spirit of service and encouragement of the pursuit of higher standards through enlightened methods. Furthermore, the fundamental Quaker belief that there is something of God in every individual, made it mandatory for the school to prepare its students intellectually and technically, while imparting the spirit of service so that upon graduation they are equipped to be good servants of their communities. The school did not indulge in mission activity, and the students' beliefs in their own religions were never challenged or deprecated. Teachers from outside the Society of Friends were expected to be in sympathy and to teach in accordance with the aforementioned principles, particularly emphasising moral values, intellectual excellence, respect for the individual, and self-reliance.
In 1889, the village of Brummana was linked by a new carriage road down the hill to Beirut below, but many students still arrived at the school gates by foot or donkey. At the turn of the century, BHS built the first tennis court in the Middle East.
By 1902, the Boys' Training Home had adopted the name Boys' High School. During that year, BHS became co-educational. It was one of the few fully co-educational schools.
When in 1914 World War I began, the Ottomans took over the school hospital and occupied the school buildings which were not re-opened until 1919. Despite the famine relief operation set up in the school's kitchens, approximately 400 out of 2000 Brummana villagers died in the great famine of 1915-18 (compared to 50% of the population of Lebanon).
After the war, Lebanon was put under French mandate, and two decades of peace and prosperity followed. In 1928, new classrooms were constructed, in 1930, a new hospital pavilion to accommodate 36 beds was completed, and in 1936, the BHS Old Scholars Association was set up.
World War II began in 1939, and when Hitler occupied France in 1940, Lebanon came under the Vichy Government, until the Allies freed it in 1941. The Second World War seriously affected the life of the school. The French followed by the British took over the school hospital. The British made the school their military headquarters for a year. Despite the war, the school stayed open with 22 boarders and 100 day students.
Lebanon became independent in 1943, and during the peace of the next three decades, the school's reputation for excellence and friendly diversity became known throughout the entire region. BHS grew to 750 students, nearly half of them boarders. The school pursued a balanced program for mind and bodies and this culminated in the following:
Around the 1960s and 1970s the school's curriculum was mainly in the English language. The school's athletics programme placed emphasis on basketball, volleyballm track and tennis. The students consisted of Arab and children of Western expatriates from across the Middle East, with members of the Bahraini, Jordanian, UAE and Saudi royal families, with a small smattering of American and British nationals. The parents of the America and European students worked in Lebanon. Most students go on to the American University of Beirut for their further studies.
In 1975, when war once again overtook Lebanon, this period of growth ended and the school lost many of its boarders, staff, and day students. In 1985, the British Quakers turned the management of the school over to a local Board who kept the educational program alive throughout difficult times, as well as taking in refugees and keeping out militia.
A. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
Brummana High School was founded by Theophilus Waldmeier, a Swiss missionary, who came to Lebanon in 1872 and who later became a Quaker and joined the Society of Friends. The Society of Friends arose in the mid 17th century in England from a religious experience of George Fox. The School is owned by the Friends Service Council in London and operated by a local Management Committee. The principal and many teachers were of British nationality and members of the Society of Friends. The education provided by the School was based on principles as understood by the Society of Friends, which stress lack of involvement in political activity, lack of discrimination, no acknowledgment of national or racial divisions and promotion of the spirit of service. They imposed no restrictions on the pursuit of higher standards through enlightened methods. Furthermore, the fundamental Quaker belief that there is something of God in every man, made it mandatory for the School to prepare its students intellectually and technically while imparting to them the spirit of service, so that upon graduation they become well equipped to be good servants of their communities. The School did not indulge in mission activity and the students' beliefs in their own religions were never challenged or depreciated. Teachers from outside the Society of Friends were expected to be in sympathy with Friends' principles and to teach in accordance with them, particularly emphasising moral and intellectual self-reliance and respect of the individual and to help the students to develop in strength and independence, treating them with gentleness but with firmness and without fear, partiality, favour or indulgence. 
In 1985, the Society of Friends totally withdrew from the School operation and handed the responsibilities to the Brummana High School Cultural Society, composed of old B.H.S. former students. Since that date, the B.H.S.-C.S. has been totally and independently responsible for the School.
B. THE BRUMMANA HIGH SCHOOL CULTURAL SOCIETY, B.H.S-C.S.
The B.H.S-C.S. is responsible for the total educational and administrative operations of B.H.S. In this regard, the authority of the Society is final. The sphere of its responsibility encompasses, planning for current and future programs, monitoring of and guiding the activities in progress, recruiting personnel and exercising quality control over all the operations.
C. STATEMENT OF POLICY
As custodian of Brummana High School, the B.H.S. Cultural Society is well aware of the serious responsibilities of the School in creating optimal conditions for its students for moral, educational and cultural growth and achievement, in line with the century old B.H.S. traditions as well as the high expectations of the School constituency. 
In the realm of moral growth and development, although the B.H.S. Cultural Society has no affiliation with the Society of Friends, it strives to maintain the basic traditions and spirit, which characterised the operation of the School for over a century and which appear in summary in the historical account. Therefore, it calls on the B.H.S. student body, teachers and constituency to abide by these traditions which emphasize honesty, kindness, truth and service, while at the same time assuring old scholars and friends of the School that the B.H.S. traditions, which they hold dear to their hearts, are upheld and will be maintained as long as the School remains in operation. 
At the educational and cultural levels, the School strives to offer a comprehensive preparation for the adult world beyond school days. There is no good activity in that adult world for which the School should not feel it its duty to prepare students. In the first place, the School promotes acquisition of information and knowledge, while at the same time it trains students in wisdom, thinking, reason, understanding and intellectual curiosity, more important personal qualities than knowledge alone. The School also strives to let its students achieve the physical, cultural and artistic fulfillment of which they are capable. 
Finally the School promotes self-reliance and independence and builds in its students the ideals of service and self-government. 
The motto of the School is "I serve", and it is for service to the world outside that the School tries to train its students.
Peace returned, and in 1998, at the request of the parents, staff, and old scholars, the British Quakers resumed management of the school, working through a new local Board to begin the process of post-war development.
In 1999, the school commissioned a major educational study as the basis for a 5-year development plan. The Science Block was extended to 3 floors, and the Science Block and Upper School Computer Laboratory were completely refurbished and fully re-equipped. In 2004, Rizkhallah House was fully refurbished to house the Infant Section and the Main Teaching Block roof was replaced. Thanks to the generous donations of old scholars, parents, and friends of the school, the process of renewal is continuing.
Notable alumni.
Bin Laden family.
Around the 1960s and 1970s, after Faisal of Saudi Arabia began to oversee the educations of the children of the Bin Laden family, many of the boys of the family attended Brummana.

Cárthach Bán Breathnach is an Irish actor and DJ most noted for his role as Jimin Ó Griofa in the hit TG4 series "Aifric", which was broadcast until the late 2000s. More recently, Bán Breathnach appeared as Aodhan in the Irish language soap Ros na Rún.
Bán Breathnach comes from Indreabhán in the Connemara Gaeltacht and is the son of radio broadcaster Seán Bán Breathnach. He is the twin brother of Léan Bán Breathnach, another actor, who also featured in both Aifric and Ros na Rún.
Cárthach Bán Breathnach began filming on new Disney show Grove High in 2011.
Aifric.
Bán Breathnach has received wide critical acclaim for his performances as Jimín Ó Gríofa in the Irish language series, "Aifric". The first series of "Afric" was screened in 2006 and it is now into its third series.
Ros na Rún.
Cárthach played the role of Aodhán, a secondary school student posing as a doctor. The storyline, which was mildly controversial, was a ratings booster for the show.
DJ Bán.
Bán Breathnach has worked as a DJ in the west of Ireland since 2007. He has appeared on local radio station i102-104.
GAA.
Breathnach is an avid Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) enthusiast and is hugely involved in his local GAA club, Mícheál Breathnach. He manages the adult ladies football side, with some success, winning the West Board Championship title in July 2011 and as reaching the County Championship final.
At University, he was heavily involved with NUI Maynooth GAA and was the manager of their freshers hurling team in 2011, taking the team to the All-Ireland final. He was the recipient of a hurling scholarship from the college and was also a member of their highly successful Sigerson Cup football team.
Soccer.
Cárthach played soccer with Connemara Celtic in his youth and was over in England on trial with both Wrexham and Norwich. A freak tear of his cruciate ligament at such a young age hampered his progress and after recovering from this he opted to stick to hurling. He is a season ticket holder of Newcastle United and attends the majority of their home fixtures, provided the games don't clash with his managerial or hurling commitments. He has been quoted as saying Demba Ba is his favourite player and was heartbroken to see him leave Newcastle. It is impossible however to decipher whether this falls under the "five lies a day" clause.

The records of the wooden village church of "St. Paraskeva", was built in 1805. Its width was 6 meters, and 17 meters in length, and 12 meters in height. It had three large domes with brass crosses. The bell tower was wooden with one dome, and four bells. The church was occupied by the Eastern Orthodox until 1944. The church was destroyed by the Polish Army during World War II, in the fall of 1944.
The cemetery dates back to 1512. After the church of 1805 was destroyed, there was little effort done to maintain the cemetery area. Since 1805 until the 1990s, the cemetery had been overgrown with trees and shrubs. Today, there are only a few tomb stones from that era left. Some have been destroyed during the building of the new stone church and by the people living there today. 
The new Orthodox church was built in 1994, in the same place that the original former Orthodox church of 1805, of St. Paraskeva stood. Which was a subsidiary of the parish in futile. The new church now falls within the parish church in Mokre to the Uniates. The stone Orthodox Church was originally intended as a cemetery chapel. Externally it is covered with a tin roof and slain plates, The dome finished with an apparent signature of the Orthodox cross to the sanctuary for Christian. In the interior of a modern iconostasis painted by Mrs. Krogulecką. In 2005, the church has been partially constructed wall paintings.
Before the curtain is the church bell tower with modern bells. The old four bell from the former church (1805), were stolen.

Zawadka Morochowska

Zawadka Morochowska (, "Zavadka Morokhivs’ka") is a former village in the administrative district of Gmina Komańcza, within Sanok County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland, close to the border with Slovakia. It was approximately north-east of Komańcza, south of Bukowsko, and south of the regional capital Rzeszów.
Zawadka Morochowska (or Bukowska, 1876) appears on records as early as the year 1567. It was a small rusyn-wallachian village on either side of the Boroniec stream. The population as of 1936 was 328. In 1939, there were 49 farms. As of January 1945, there were said to be 425 Ukrainians there. The Greek Catholic Church of the Circumcision of Our Lord was built there in 1856. It was a filial church of the church in nearby Morochów, which is much older. The village generally endured through World War II until 1944. 
This village was the subject of repression by the Soviet-sponsored Polish Army in early 1946 as part of the campaign to eliminate suspected support for the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). 
In January, 1946, a unit of Polish communist soldiers came into the area, and launched offenses against Bukowica, Ratnawica, and Zboiska, among other places. They were searching for an alleged 800 UPA members led by "Ren." They attempted to engage the UPA forces near Zawadka Morochowska, and in the process of the search, massacred dozens of the village's residents including men, women and children. This massacre was followed by at least two additional massacres in March, 1946. Residents who remained alive by 1947 were deported to the Western territories that Poland had acquired through the Yalta conference. A memorial to the victims of the Zawadka massacre stands in the cemetery, near the mass graves that hold the victims bodies.
The parish Birth record of Zawadka Morochowska (1784–1890) and the Death record of Zawadka Morochowska (1784–1943) are at the "Meeting of the Lord Orthodox Church" in Morochów. This Orthodox Church is in the building once used by the Greek Catholic Church of Morochow.

Cobatoxin

Cobatoxin is a toxin present in the venom of the scorpion "Centruroides noxius". It blocks two potassium channel subtypes; voltage-gated and calcium-activated channels.
Etymology.
Coba is a region in Mexico where the "Centruroides noxius" scorpion is found.
Source.
Cobatoxin 1 and 2 are both found in the venom of the "Centruroides noxius" scorpion.
Chemistry.
Structure.
Cobatoxin is a 32-residue toxin with 3 disulfide bridges, which are located on C1-C4, C2-C5 and C3- C6 (Cys3-Cys22, Cys8-Cys27, and Cys12-Cys29). The peptide backbone is folded according to an α/β scaffold, both α-helical and two-stranded β-sheet structures are present. Cobatoxin 1 has a rod-like shape due to an extended N-terminus.
Family.
Cobatoxin 1 and 2 both belong to the α-KTx family. The α-KTx family is part of the K+-channel-specific scorpion toxins (KTx), which consists of 3 families; α, β, and γ. These 3 families differ in structure.
Target.
Cobatoxin 1 and 2 both block the Kv1.1 K+-channels in mice and the Shaker B K+ channels in insects, which are voltage-dependent K+-channels (Selisko, 1998).
Other voltage-dependent K+-channels that are blocked by Cobatoxin 1 are the Kv1.2 K+-channels in rats and Kv1.3 K+-channels in mice. Cobatoxin 1 also blocks the IKCa1 Ca2+-activated K+-channel.
Mode of action.
Cobatoxin 1 is a pore-blocking toxin. The interaction between cobatoxin 1 and the Kv1.2 channel is first esthablished by four salt bridges, which are formed between side chains of the four Kv1.2 α-subunits and amino acids residues of cobatoxin 1. This way a stable complex is formed, named the toxin-ring. Next, a tighter interaction is formed by a hydrophobic interaction between cobatoxin 1 and the α-subunit. Then the Lys21 side chain of cobatoxin 1 blocks the pore by entering the P-domain of the ion channel, which is the selectivity filter.
Toxicity.
The of cobatoxin 1 after intracerebroventricular injection in mice is 500±45 ng.

Markus Halsti

Markus Halsti (born 19 March 1984 in Helsinki) is a Finnish football defender and midfielder who plays for Malmö FF and the Finland national team
Club career.
In Finland.
Starting his career in FC Viikingit before moving to HJK in the Finnish top league in 2003, he debuted in 2003. His 2005 season ended badly with a serious injury in the middle of the season. Same injury came later in the beginning of 2007 when he again missed half of the season due to this fracture in his right leg. This was also his last year in HJK as he signed to a Swedish club GAIS after a tip off from former Finnish national team coach Roy Hodgson as a bosman. However, before he ever had a chance to make a debut for GAIS he moved to the Allsvenskan rivals Malmö FF. Before signing with GAIS, he was on trial with Italian Atalanta and Leeds United. The Norwegian clubs Start and Molde IF, as well as a few unknown Danish clubs were also interested to sign him, but found him too expensive.
Malmö FF.
Following a disappointing couple of years with Malmö FF with a knee injury, Halsti reinvigorated his club career by heading in the 3-2 goal against Kalmar FF away from home in April 2010, which ultimately won Malmö the match. In the same game he also got injured, and due to this injury he missed most of the 2010 season. In 2010 Malmö FF won the league just ahead of their rivals Helsingborgs IF. Halsti played as a central defender and right defender positions during the 2011 season. He scored his second goal for the club in the away derby match against Helsingborgs IF, which eventually ended in a 2-2 draw. 
In 2011 Malmö FF was close of qualification to the Champions League, first winning Rangers FC away 1-0 where Halsti played as a right back, and then getting 1-1 draw at home in a game where Halsti was injured once again. In the end GNK Dinamo Zagreb went to the Group Stage of the tournament by only one goal marginal, as they first won home 4-1 but then lost 2-0 in Malmö. Halsti played in both games, making a goal pass to 1-1 goal in Zagreb. Malmö still qualified to the Europa League in the same group as AZ Alkmaar, FC Metalist Kharkiv and FK Austria Wien. In the group Malmö didn't have much chance as they got only 1 point in 6 games. AZ Alkmaar and FC Metalist Kharkiv qualified to the quarter- finals of the tournament but were both beaten there. Halsti played totally three games in the competition. 
For the 2012 season, Halsti found himself in tough competition for a starting spot, and only received limited time on the pitch for the first part of the season. After the summer break, manager Rikard Norling decided that he wanted to play Halsti as a central midfielder, a position where the team needed reinforcement. In total Halsti played 13 matches for Malmö FF during the 2012 season, the majority as a midfielder. After the end of the season Halsti was offered a new contract lasting until the end of the 2014 season. Halsti extended his contract on 3 December 2012. 
During the 2013 season, Halsti became an integral part of the Malmö side that secured the championship in late October 2013. Halsti continued to play as a central midfielder during the season and played 28 matches and scored two goals in his most successful season yet at the club. Halsti scored the only goal of the game in the last minutes of the first half in the home fixture against title contender AIK on 11 August 2013. He later scored the club's last goal of the season in the 3–1 win against Syrianska FC at home on 3 November 2013.
International career.
Halsti made his debut for the Finnish national team on 6 February 2008 in a friendly match against Greece. During 2013 he became a regular squad player, and was played in several defensive positions.

Hayy Al-Jami'a () is a neighborhood in the Mansour district of Baghdad, Iraq. 
The neighborhood was originally created during the mid-1960s, to provide housing for university professors. This is the origin of its name, since "Jamia" means "University" in Arabic. Hence, its full name is "Hay Al-Jamia" or "University Neighborhood". 
During the recent sectarian troubles that plagued Baghdad, Hay Al-Jamiá became one of the primary trouble areas in Western Baghdad, to the point that during the period (late 2006 - early 2007), the whole neighbourhood became a de facto "ghost town". However, after the return of security in 2008, it has regained much of its former vitality.
Geography.
It is bordered by the following neighborhoods: Al-Adil to the North, Al-Mansur and Al-Dawoodi to the East, Al-Shurta to the South, and Al-Khadraa and Al-Ghazaliah to the West.
Transport.

Al-A'amiriya

Al-A'amiriya ( Arabic العامريه ) is a western neighborhood of Baghdad, Iraq. It is an upper-class Sunni neighborhood in the west of the city on the way to Anbar Province.
History.
In March 2007, American troops cleared the neighborhood during one of the first major operations of the "surge" strategy. In May 2007, Sunni militants affiliated with Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia clashed for several days with gunmen from rival insurgent groups, including the 1920s Revolution Brigades. It was the first sign in Baghdad of "the Sunni Awakening" —what the American military has described as a grass-roots Sunni movement against Sunni extremists. Since then, the neighborhood has been surrounded by concrete walls and military checkpoints, creating enough security for the market to revive, but also frustrating residents whose movements have been restricted. Some residents praise the new volunteers, calling them "the genuine locals," not a militia. Others describe the amateur force as unknown, untested and untrustworthy. The consensus complaint is that the walls and checkpoints around Amiriya force residents to live a life under siege, unable to trust either the Iraqi security forces, the so-called "freedom fighters" or the Americans.

Al-Saydiya

Al-Saydiya is a neighborhood of Baghdad, Iraq. A once middle-class district in southwest Baghdad, much of it was built within the last three decades on prime real estate between Baghdad Airport Road and the main highway where it forks into central Baghdad and south to Basra. Al-Saydiya is one of the turned-Sunni Arab areas after 2006-2007. Before that time it was mixed with respect to the facts that the majority sections of the neighborhood were overwhelmingly Sunni, like the officers' quarter reserved for Hussein loyalists. Minority were Shia. Others were mixed with other religions. Now, by general consent, Saydia is one of the worst areas of Baghdad, if not the worst. Sunni insurgents plant roadside bombs intended for American troops and fire at the mainly Shia policemen from mosques and other buildings overlooking their bases and checkpoints. Thousands of Shia residents have fled. They do not expect to return to Al-Saydiya anymore.
Displacement.
The majority have left, fleeing death squads. Insurgents occupy empty houses.

Bab Al-Sharqi

Bab Al-Sharqi is a neighborhood of central Baghdad, Iraq. The area surrounding Bab Al-Sharqi market is a stronghold of the Mahdi Army, the main Shia militia in central Iraq.
January 2007 bombings.
The neighborhood was affected by the 22 January 2007 Baghdad bombings when two powerful car bombs ripped through Bab Al-Sharqi Market, killing at least 88 people and wounding 160 others in one of the bloodiest days since the US invasion of Iraq. The attack occurred two days after the start of the 10-day Shiite festival leading up to Ashoura.
The blasts at the Baghdad market were aimed at a Shiite area and seemed timed to inflict maximum damage, occurring at noon local time, which is one of the busiest times of the day. Police officials said the blasts were so large that each of the cars carried more than 200 pounds of explosives. The explosions could be heard from the eastern banks of the nearby Tigris River. In the aftermath, the large number of bodies required workers to stack them on top of one another in wooden carts, while other victims were simply blown to pieces. Fires from the explosion engulfed at least a dozen cars, creating clouds of smoke large enough that they drifted over the Green Zone, about half a mile away.
In the past, such attacks by Sunni Arab insurgents have been met by swift reprisals, a cycle of violence that left some 34,000 Iraqis dead last year directly because of the attacks and many more lives lost indirectly. The bombings, directed specifically at civilians, seemed intended to elicit a reprisal, much like the 23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings that killed at least 215 people. A suicide bomber had killed at least 63 people in the same area a month earlier.

Radomyśl nad Sanem is a village in Stalowa Wola County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Radomyśl nad Sanem. It lies on the San river in Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Stalowa Wola and north of the regional capital Rzeszów. The village has a population of 893. Radomyśl was a town from 1558 to 1935.
In the early days of Polish statehood, the area of Radomyśl belonged to the Duchy of Sandomierz, which later became Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1474, Lublin Voivodeship was created out of its eastern part, and Radomyśl belonged to this province until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), when it was annexed by Austria, together with whole Galicia. Radomyśl nad Sanem itself was founded as a private village in 1556, by a local nobleman Jakub Sienienski. Two years later, King Zygmunt August granted it a town charter (Magdeburg rights), and in 1584, King Stefan Batory gave permission for an annual fair and weekly markets, organized on each Monday. In the Second Polish Republic, Radomyśl nad Sanem belonged to Lwow Voivodeship, and in 1935 it lost its town charter, after almost 400 years.

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) also known as platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is a phospholipase A2 enzyme that in humans is encoded by the "PLA2G7" gene. Lp-PLA2 is a 45-kDa protein of 441 amino acids. It is one of several PAF acetylhydrolases.
Function.
In the blood it travels mainly with low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Less than 20% is associated with high-density lipoprotein HDL. It is an enzyme produced by inflammatory cells and hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids in LDL.
Lp-PLA2 is platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (EC 3.1.1.47), a secreted enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of PAF to inactive products by hydrolysis of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position, producing the biologically inactive products LYSO-PAF and acetate.
Clinical significance.
Lp-PLA2 is involved in the development of atherosclerosis, an observation that has prompted interest as a possible therapeutic target (see, e.g. the investigational drug Darapladib). In human atherosclerotic lesions, 2 main sources of Lp-PLA2 can be identified, including that which is brought into the intima bound to LDL (from the circulation), and that which is synthesized de novo by plaque inflammatory cells (macrophages, T cells, mast cells)."
It is used as a marker for cardiac disease.
A meta-analysis involving a total of 79,036 participants in 32 prospective studies found that Lp-PLA2 levels are positively correlated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke.

Bror Emil Hildebrand

Bror Emil Hildebrand (22 February 1806, Madesjö – 30 August 1884) was a Swedish archaeologist, numismatist and museum director. From 1837 to 1879 he was Custodian of Ancient Monuments and Secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters. From 1847 he was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and from 1866 a member of the Swedish Academy. In 1847 he founded the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm.
In 1830 Hildebrand became reader in numismatics at the University of Lund . About this time he was also taught archaeology by C.J. Thomsen in nearby Copenhagen: thus Hildebrand introduced the three-age system to Sweden. His main scholarly legacy lies within the field of Medieval Anglo-Saxon numismatics, where he produced pioneering catalogues and studies. Much of this work was indirectly due to agricultural reforms in Sweden that led to Viking Period silver coin hoards surfacing at a rate never seen before or after Hildebrand's day.
B.E. Hildebrand was the father of archaeologist Hans Hildebrand and teacher both to him and to archaeologist Oscar Montelius.

Plating (philately)

Plating refers to the reconstruction of a pane or "sheet" of postage stamps printed from a single plate by using individual stamps and overlapping strips and blocks of stamps. Likewise, if a sheet 10 or 20 postal cards is typeset, the variations of the letters or design elements may allow reconstruction or plating of the sheets based on these differences.
Basics.
For plating to be possible, there must be constant variants in details of the stamps printed from a single plate or lithographic stone so that one can identify the exact original position of each stamp. Evidence that may be used in plating includes defects or "flaws" occurring in the transfer of images, individual touch-ups by the engraver, recuttings of the plates, repairs, and accidental injuries to the plates. From their inception in 1840 until 1884, postage stamps from Great Britain incorporated control letters in the corners indicating the stamps's exact position on the sheet, e.g., A...C is first row, third stamp, and for a period also incorporated the number of the plate from which the stamps were printed. Other evidence such as color of the ink used or watermarks in the paper may be of use in reconstructing plates. In the absence of such evidence, plating is not possible. Because of the highly accurate methods of modern stamp production, most modern issues cannot be plated.
Classic issues.
Philatelists have made extensive efforts in plating many of the Nineteenth Century Classic postage stamp issues and have written a number of books on plating different stamp issues. One of the greatest philatelic achievements is the plating of the Penny Black and its succeeding Penny Red Brown stamps issued beginning in 1840. Those stamps were printed in sheets of 240 stamps. The plates would wear as printing went on and were often replaced. Beginning with the 71st plate of Die II in 1858, the plate number was inconspicuously engraved on the stamps themselves. All the stamps bore control letters which indicated the exact position on the sheet, so that reconstructing the plates beginning with plate 71 is simply a matter of finding the necessary stamps. The stamps printed from the first 70 plates of Die II and all the plates from Die I 200, however, bore no numbers to indicate the specific plate used to print them, and their plating presented vastly greater problems. Through painstaking study of the stamps, philatelists were able to reconstruct most or all of the first Die II's 70 plates. Later philatelists were assisted when reference copies and high quality photographs of the original panes kept by the British Government were made available for inspection. The other early engraved stamp issues of Great Britain have similarly been plated.
In contrast, plates of other classic stamps were relatively easy to reconstruct. One of the easiest was the stamps of Corrientes, which were individually crudely engraved so that the differences between the stamps are obvious to a non-expert. Early stamps of Mauritius have been used to reconstruct a series of original panes printed from plates displaying increasing states of wear, from early (stamps bold and clear) to late (stamps very light and weak)

Charlotte de Sauve

Charlotte de Beaune Semblançay, Viscountess of Tours, Baroness de Sauve, Marquise de Noirmoutier (26 October 1551 – 30 September 1617) was a French noblewoman and a mistress of King Henry of Navarre, who later ruled as King Henry IV of France. She was a member of Queen Mother Catherine de' Medici's notorious "Flying Squadron" ("L'escadron volant" in French), a group of beautiful female spies and informants recruited to seduce important men at Court, and thereby extract information to pass on to the Queen Mother.
Biography.
Charlotte was born in France on 26 October 1551, the daughter and only child of Jacques de Beaune, Baron Semblançay, Viscount of Tours, and Gabrielle de Sade, a descendant of Provençal nobility. The family seat was in the former province of Touraine. Her great-grandfather, Jacques de Beaune was a superindendent of finance to King Francis I who ordered his execution in 1527 at the instigation of his mother, Louise of Savoy. Charlotte later succeeded her father to the barony of Semblançay and the viscounty of Tours.
Charlotte was sent to court where she was educated in the household of the Queen Mother, Catherine de' Medici. Blonde-haired, and described as having been "beautiful, intelligent, and immoral", she was married to Simon de Fizes, Baron de Sauve, secretary of state first to King Charles IX and afterwards King Henry III, in 1569 when she was eighteen years old. Her marriage was arranged by the powerful Guise family. In the words of historian Jean Heritier, her background meant that "at twenty-one, she knew all there was to be known about politics". Charlotte's alleged beauty has been contradicted by author Mark Strage who instead described Charlotte as having had a face that was "more agreeable and animated than sensuous".
She was appointed maid-of-honour to Marguerite de Valois. She is recorded as taking part in some of the extravagant pageants and ballets which Catherine de' Medici produced in abundance. She helped Catherine mount an outdoor banquet and lavish show depicting the "Apotheosis of Woman" on 9 June 1577 at the château of Chenonceau. During the banquet the male guests were served by Catherine's most beautiful ladies-in-waiting who wore topless gowns and their hair flowing loose as was the custom of brides on their wedding night.
On 27 November 1579 her husband died. Charlotte married secondly on 18 October 1584, Francois de La Tremoille, Marquis de Noirmoutier and gave birth to a son, Louis de La Tremoille in 1586. In 1608, Louis would succeed his father as Marquis de Noirmoutier. On 13 March 1610, he married Lucrèce Bouhier, by whom he had a son, Louis de La Tremoille, 1st Duke of Noirmoutier (25 December 1612- 12 October 1666). A notable descendant of Charlotte was Marie-Anne de la Trémoille, Princesse des Ursins.
Flying Squadron.
Shortly after Henry of Navarre's marriage to Catherine's daughter Marguerite de Valois in 1572, Catherine recruited Charlotte to her elite group of beautiful female spies and informants known as the "Flying Squadron" ("L'escadron volant") and she quickly became one of its "most accomplished members". The Queen Mother's purpose in inviting Charlotte to join the group was for the latter to seduce Navarre, become his confidante as well as mistress, and thus extract information which she would duly pass on to Catherine who would subsequently use it as political leverage. The "Flying Squadron" had a male counterpart in "Les Mignons". Charlotte quickly became Navarre's mistress and exerted a strong influence over him. His wife Marguerite recorded in her memoirs: "Mme de Sauve so completely ensnared my husband that we no longer slept together, not even conversed". She accused de Sauve ("that Circe") of persuading Henry that she was jealous of de Sauve, with the result that Henry, whose affairs Marguerite had allowed, stopped confiding in her.
Charlotte de Sauve has been credited as a source of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops. In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: "Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them and Alençon in such a way that they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: "The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [Charlotte de Sauve to speak to me. They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, and I want to be one jump ahead of them". On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.
In the autumn of 1578, she was recorded as having been one of the three hundred members of the court which accompanied Catherine and Marguerite on a royal progress to the Kingdom of Navarre where the latter was reunited with her husband who had returned to his kingdom two years earlier. However, instead of resuming his love affair with Charlotte, Navarre's interest was caught by Victoria de Ayala, a beautiful Spanish girl and a recent recruit to the "Flying Squadron".
Charlotte de Sauve later became the mistress of Navarre's greatest adversary, Henry I, Duke of Guise, with whom she spent the night at Blois on 22 December 1588, before his assassination by "the Forty-five", Henry III's bodyguards, the following morning. She had other lovers, including the Duc d'Épernon and the Seigneur d'Avrilly.
Later years and death.
She appears again in 1599 when she was called upon as a witness in the annulment proceedings of Henry of Navarre (who had succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV in 1589) and Marguerite, who had proved to be sterile. Henry wished to annul his marriage in order to marry Marie de' Medici and sire an heir. Charlotte testified that Marguerite had been forced to marry Henry by Charles IX and the Queen Mother swearing that Catherine had threatened Marguerite that "if she did not consent to this marriage, she would make her the most miserable woman in the kingdom". The annulment was granted on 17 December 1599 leaving King Henry free to wed Marie de' Medici by whom he had six legitimate royal offspring, including his heir Louis.
Charlotte died on 30 September 1617 less than a month before her sixty-sixth birthday.
In film.
The role of Charlotte de Sauve was played by Italian actress Asia Argento in the 1994 film "La Reine Margot" starring Isabelle Adjani in the title role. In the film the character dies while unknowingly trying to poison Henry of Navarre.

Czudec

Czudec is a town in Strzyżów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Czudec. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately north-east of Strzyżów and south-west of the regional capital Rzeszów. The village has a population of 2,900, and has a rail station on the secondary-importance line from Rzeszów to Jasło.
The history of Czudec dates back to the year 1185, when Mikołaj Bogoria from the town of Bogoria near Sandomierz granted a number of Lesser Poland’s villages to the newly established Koprzywnica Cistercian abbey. Among those villages was Czudec. In 1263 in Tarnów, Lesser Poland’s prince Bolesław V the Chaste met with Daniel of Galicia, to establish a border between the two states. According to their agreement, Czudec was to remain within Lesser Poland, while nearby Rzeszów belonged to Red Ruthenia.
On September 11, 1427, King Władysław Jagiełło granted Magdeburg rights town charter to Czudec. The new town was permitted to have one fair a week, and to create several guilds. Until 1627, Czudec belonged to the Strzyżowski family. The town then passed into the hands of the Grabieński family (Pomian coat of arms), which owned it until 1840. Until 1772, Czudec belonged to Pilzno County of Sandomierz Voivodeship. After the Partitions of Poland, it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and from 1772 to 1918, belonged to the province of Galicia. In the 19th century the town declined, as its artisans could not compete with modern industry. Finally, in 1935, the government of the Second Polish Republic stripped Czudec of the town charter; it has remained a village ever since.

Sha'ab () is a neighborhood of Adhamiyah district, Baghdad, Iraq, It is subdivided to Sha'ab east (22nd), Sha'ab south (23rd), Sha'ab north (24th).
Two adjoining neighborhoods abutting Sadr City's northern border, Shaab and Ur, were built in the 1960s and 1970s to house middle-class government workers. It was formerly mixed, but Shia cleansing started in 2005, and last fall and winter Ur became a favored dumping ground for bodies from all over Baghdad, with 121 bodies showing up in December near a mechanic's shop on the area's outer edge. Today the area (Shaab, Ur and neighboring Binouk) are nearly as Shias as Sadr City. The killings have dwindled, and with sectarian homogeneity has come a greater sense of security; the commercial districts have expanded with new cosmetic and clothing stores that suggest rising incomes. American troops pounded through here in February as part of the new military strategy, and residents report that the operation scattered many of the worst Mahdi commanders at the time. Shias militias remain a powerful force, but according to some residents, they govern with less brutality than in some parts of western Baghdad where Shias still feel threatened.

Rachel Dard

Rachel Dard (born 2 September 1951) was a French professional cyclist said to have raced across France to avoid a positive dope finding and ended up in a row which exposed organised drug-taking in cycling in the 1970s.
Dope test.
Dard was riding for Peugeot in 1976. Maurice De Muer was the manager, Bernard Thévenet the star rider and François Bellocq the doctor. At the start of that year the team rode L'Étoile des Espoirs, a stage race in south-west France. Jean-Luc Vandenbroucke was race leader and Dard, his team-mate, had won the stage to Dax.
Dard and a further team-mate, Bourreau, were called for a dope test. Both were caught trying to defraud the control with a condom of untainted urine in their shorts to give the impression they were urinating.
Dard, it was reported, left the control room and then realised that his place in the race, perhaps his team, were over before the season had properly started. He found the doctor, Bruno Chaumont, and begged him not to report the positive. Chaumont agreed to burn the reports. Dard then realised that while there may be no positive report, the absence of a report meant there had been no test either. He would have to explain why Chaumont had returned to the French federation with two empty bottles identified as his.
Bourreau had accepted his guilt and didn't want to take it further. But Dard is said to have gone back to the test centre for the empty bottles. But Chaumont had left by train to Paris. Dard got a lift to the station with another Peugeot rider, Bernard Croyet. They arrived just as Chaumont's train left for Paris. The two ran back to their car and drove across France to get to Paris before him. They reached Austerlitz station in time to meet Chaumont on the platform. Dard begged until tears ran down his face, literally. And again Chaumont relented. He took out the two bottles and smashed them. Dard (see below) disputes the story.
Chaumont said:
That evening, I took the train with the empty test bottles closed with seals. There was no question of taking samples from the riders because they had cheated. The next morning, at Austerlitz station in Paris, at 6.30am, who do I see? Rachel Dard, accompanied by a second person, short with brown curly hair, that I didn't recognise. He begged me not to denounce him. After hesitating, I agreed. I threw the test bottles into the gutter to show him that I understood his problems but I made him promise not to say anything. Well, pretty quickly, everything was revealed. Who talked? Certainly not me.
Revelations.
Weeks passed and nothing happened. Then "L'Équipe" coincidentally ran a story about dope-taking in French cycling. Chaumont told the tale. Dard now had nothing more to lose, so he too went to "L'Équipe" and spilled the inside story, right down to providing the prescriptions for dope that Bellocq, the team doctor, had given him. He said riders treated with cortisone and steroids were now in "a pitiful state".
Row.
A row then broke out between Dard and the doctor. Dard said:
To which the doctor replied:
His attitude is incredible ["c'est fabuleux, une pareille attitude"]. But I can understand Rachel Dard; but finally, if he had never confessed, I would never have dropped him. I would have defended him. I don't want the death of a sinner. I came into cycling to try to overcome the wall that exists between the cyclist and the doctor. I'm not there to do the dirty on anyone ["pour faire tomber un tel ou un autre"].
The story, however, also appears in a book by the team doctor, Bellocq, who died aged 47 in 1993 and was a believer in cortisone as a treatment for racing cyclists. Bernard Thévenet accused him of ruining his career.
Aftermath.
Bellocq was banned from working for the French federation, although he continued to work for teams. Chaumont, too, was disciplined by the Fédération Française de Cyclisme.
The doping historian, Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, named Peugeot's manager, Maurice de Muer, as the "gold medallist" in doping in cycling. "You'd be hard-pushed to count how many doping affairs de Muer has been involved with... at the head of Bic, then Peugeot. had for the period 1970-1978 twenty-four positive cases concerning riders in these teams of the 70 total. That's 36 per cent!"
Peugeot was in no moral position to fire Dard. He raced at least once again but de Muer told him he would never ride anything better than third-rate events. Dard left the team and racing at the end of his contract. He opened a bike shop in St-Germain-du-Plain in Paris.

Men in Fright

Men in Fright is a 1938 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by George Sidney. Produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was the 172nd "Our Gang" short to be released.
Plot.
Darla has had a tonsillectomy, and the gang, announcing themselves as "Third Ward Sunshine Spredders Club", go to the hospital to pay her a visit. They bring with them a large picnic basket full of food that they know Darla can't eat, intending to eat it all themselves after Darla refuses it. When the kids make it to Darla's room in the children's ward, Spanky assigns Alfalfa to stay outside and guard the picnic basket until they're sure Darla's still too sick to eat any of it.
While waiting, however, Alfalfa falls for the scheme of another resident of the children's ward - a boy intending to escape from his own tonsillectomy. He offers Alfalfa a dime to change clothes with him while he "goes for a little walk", leaving Alfalfa to fend for himself when an orderly comes to collect him for the tonsil operation. While in the elevator, little Gary, who's stowed away aboard the gurney the orderly is transporting Alfalfa on, opens a canister of laughing gas, sending himself, Alfalfa, the orderly, and even the elevator operator into various fits of mirth and odd behavior. Spanky, Porky, Buckwheat, and leonard do their best to try to catch Alfalfa, who, thanks to the laughing gas, is now romping deliriously through the hospital and causing havoc and mischief.
When Spanky and the boys finally manage to drag Alfalfa back into Darla's room, a still tipsy Alfalfa hops on her bed and jumps for the chandelier, finally calming down after falling to the floor and knocking a pitcher of water off the dresser and onto his head. Just before finally diving into their picnic, a nurse arrives to deliver Darla's afternoon dish of ice cream (ice cream being the only food she can eat at the moment). The nurse also offers the six boys dishes of ice cream as well, and when she leaves, they tear into their picnic basket as well, combining ice cream with hamburgers, pickles, hot dogs, and watermelons in such a way that they all end up with horrible stomachaches (depicted through an animated segment of a hot dog fighting with a scoop of ice cream). The boys are admitted into the hospital for indigestion, just as Darla is released to go home. Darla and her mother promise to visit the boys tomorrow and offer to bring "some nice presents", forcing Spanky and Alfalfa to wince and moan "just bring flowers" as they are wheeled away for their treatment: one dose each of castor oil.
Notes.
The film is considered one of the better of the MGM "Our Gang" comedies, was shot on the sets used for MGM's "Dr. Kildare" films. The title ""Men in Fright"" is meant to parody the 1934 MGM hospital-set feature "Men in White" (which was also parodied by the Three Stooges as "Men in Black" that same year).

Niebylec, Podkarpackie Voivodeship

Niebylec is a village in Strzyżów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Niebylec. Niebylec lies in eastern part of historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-east of Strzyżów and south of the regional capital Rzeszów. The village has a population of 594, and is located along National Road Nr. 9, which also makes Polish part of the European route E371. Niebylec, even though a village now, used to be a town from 1509 until 1919. 
In the 15th and 16th centuries, the village, known at that time as Jawornik, belonged to the noble Machowski family (Abdank coat of arms). Jawornik received Magdeburg rights in 1509, due to efforts of Mikolaj Machowski of Machow. The town was part of Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, remaining a small location in the eastern outskirts of the province, close to the border with Red Ruthenia. In 1646, a new Roman Catholic church was built here by Niebylec’s new owner, Janusz Romer. In the late 17th and the 18th centuries, the town belonged to several families. Niebylec was one of the centers of the Bar Confederation, and in 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Galicia. In the 19th century, the number of Jews grew in Niebylec, and by the early 20th century, they made the majority of the population. Niebylec lost its charter in 1919, as it was too small to remain a town. 
During World War II, Jewish population was decimated in the Holocaust. The area of the village was a stronghold of the Home Army (AK), as part of AK’s Rzeszow- South Inspectorate.
Niebylec has a parish church, built in 1936-1943 on the spot of the location of the 1646 church. In the village there also is a synagogue (second half of the 19th century), which now houses a library. Furthermore, the village has a 15th-century manor house, rebuilt in the 18th and 19th centuries, and a late 18th-century roadside chapel.

4-poster

A 4-poster or four poster automotive test system is specifically designed for the testing of vehicles (cars, trucks). These test systems consist of 4 hydraulic actuators on top of which the wheels of the vehicle are placed. Movements of the actuators simulate the road surface and forces exerted by the road on the wheels. The movements of the system are tightly controlled by a digital test controller. During the research phase of a vehicle a 4-poster system is used to test newly designed suspension systems and their durability. In production 4-poster systems are usually used to test every vehicle at the end of the production line on squeak and rattle, which is a check to make sure the vehicle doesn't have any loose parts. Different kinds of testing are possible: sine test (sweep in frequency); simple wave form on each actuator; open loop test (driven by an external tension signal); a particular testing method called ICS control, which allows to reproduce on a car an actual service environment, starting from those data coming from the outdoor acquisition sessions.

Paul Coutts

Paul Alexander Coutts (born 22 July 1988 in Aberdeen) is a Scottish footballer who plays for Derby County.
Club career.
Aberdeen.
Coutts started his football career at Scottish Premier League side Aberdeen as a youth player from aged 10, the club he supported as a boy before he was released by the club aged 16 because the club thought he was too small to play professional football. Coutts this move as a ""a big blow to be told by Aberdeen that I wouldn't be getting a contract but it was also a blessing in disguise.""
Cove Rangers.
Coutts then moved to Highland Football League side Cove Rangers in 2005, where at the club he also had a full-time job working in the oil industry, on this work and football clash Coutts said that he ""didn't go on the rigs but I probably would have done if I hadn't made it as a footballer. It was hard work doing a full-time job and then dashing off to training a couple of nights a week or for midweek games. Combining the two things can be pretty tiring. I did it for about a year and it was quite a tough time but I was about 17 or 18 and full of energy. Looking back, it was a good learning curve for me.""
During his time at Rangers he was a part of their 2007–08 title winning season, he also won the league's "Player of the Year" award in the same season. Cove's chairman Keith Moorhouse that was Coutts second season at the club ""was absolutely outstanding, head and shoulders the best player in the league. He worked really hard on his upper-body strength and started to boss games."" The captain of the club Kevin Tindall said that Coutts ""had a good head on his shoulders. He listened to the senior players and the manager but he also had confidence in his own ability As centre-half at the time, Paul played in front of me and it was a joy to just give him the ball. We knew he would get a chance in the professional game.""
Peterborough United.
Coutts then joined Peterborough United on a three-year deal in July 2008 for a nominal fee after impressing with his ball control during a trial period with the club, which involved playing an hour during each of two pre-season friendlies, against a Liverpool XI and Stevenage Borough. Coutts made his professional debut for Peterborough as a substitute in Peterborough's 5–4 win over Bristol Rovers, and had his first start the following game against local rivals Northampton Town, a 1–1 draw. In Coutts' first season with Peterborough, he made 37 league appearances and 4 FA Cup appearances as well as a Football League Trophy appearance as "The Posh" gained promotion to the Championship. On the 2008–09 season, Coutts said ""I came from playing non-league in Scotland to winning promotion at Peterborough in one season, so that was probably the biggest jump for me so far.""
In the 2009–10 season, Coutts made 16 Championship appearances the following season, with 1 game in the FA Cup and League Cup before attracting the interest of Preston North End in January 2010. after Ferguson took over from Alan Irvine. Ferguson was sacked by Peterborough and replaced by Mark Cooper in November 2009. Cooper said the interest in the player was expected and Coutts was later left out of the Peterborough match day squad that played against Sheffield Wednesday on 23 January 2010, Cooper later denied unrest in the dressing room after several "Posh" players wanted to join Preston. Coper was sacked by the club on 1 February 2010, as the rumours of Coutts rejoining Ferguson at Preston intensified.
Preston North End.
Coutts signed a deal with Preston North End in February 2010 when former Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson was in charge at the central Lancashire club. Coutts was a first team regular under Ferguson and Phil Brown, as Preston were relegated in League One in the 2010–11 season. Preston also turned down a bid from Coutts former club Peterborough United in August 2011, who had been promoted back to the Championship under Ferguson's management.
In December 2011, Coutts was named the club captain as Graham Alexander took up a coaching role after Brown's was sacked as team manager and retained the role under new manager Graham Westley who took over in January 2012. However, on 3 February 2012 he was stripped of the Preston captaincy by Westley who was unimpressed by the Scotmans attitude. Later on in the month, former club Peterborough United dismissed interest in a loan move for the player. Coutts did remain as a regular in the team until the end of the season.
On 20 February 2012, Coutts goal against Colchester United on 6 August 2011 was one of the five nominees for the 2011 Football League Goal of Year award selected out of a shortlist of 10 by Soccer AM viewers for the 2012 Football League Awards. The award winners were announced on 11 March 2012 and Coutts lost on the award to Cardiff City's Peter Whittingham's goal against Barnsley in the Championship which was scored on 13 March 2011.
Ahead of the 2012–13 season, Coutts along with 7 other players was told by the manager via SMS not to report to pre-season training as he was not in Westley's plans. Coutts had turned down a move to Peterborough United and was attracting interest from Championship clubs Derby County and Birmingham City. Chairman Peter Ridsdale stated that Derby's interest was "an enquiry at this stage rather than an offer." On 12 July 2012, Coutts began talks with Derby County with a deal being reported as close to being completed on 13 July 2012.
Derby County.
On 14 July 2012, Coutts joined Derby County on a three-year contract, joining up with Scotland team mate Craig Bryson. The fee for the player was speculated be to £150,000. On his move to Derby, Coutts said ""This is a big move for me," he said. "I have had a few big moves along the way in terms of stepping up, and this is another one. Hopefully, I can take it in my stride. I have played in the Championship for a few seasons, so I know what it's about. It is a big step but I feel I am at a stage in my career where I can deal with it and the lads here at Derby have been great. They have made me feel welcome."" He also said that his early days at semi-professional Cove Rangers made him grateful for professional career ""When I look back, it certainly makes me appreciate how lucky I am to be playing football professionally and I will never take it for granted. When you have seen the other side of it, and what you could be doing, you are grateful to have the chance to go into work every day and play football.""
Coutts made his Derby debut against Scunthorpe United in the League Cup, a game which Derby drew 5–5 after extra-time but went on to lose 6–7 on penalties. Coutts made his league début for Derby in the first game of the season, a 2–2 draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday, providing an assist for the second Derby goal. Coutts added to his assist total by creating two more goals in Derby's 5–1 win over Watford on 1 September. Coutts scored his first goal for the club in Derby's 2–2 draw at Middlesbrough on 3 October 2012. Coutts remained a regular in the starting eleven in the early part of the season, with Coutts saying in the December interview that Derby had the capabilities to beat anyone in the league. Coutts remained a fixture in the Derby starting eleven and scored his second goal of the season in Derby's 2–1 win at Leeds United on 1 April.
He was named the 37th best player in the 2012–13 Football League Championship by the Actim Index. Coutts 2013–14 pre-season was disrupted by injury and in late September, he dislocated a knee in a match against Leicester City and was expected to take at least five months to recover.
International career.
Coutts was called up to the Scotland under-21 side for the first time in November 2008, for the friendly against Northern Ireland under-21 on 18 November 2008. Coutts made his debut in the game, which Scotland lost 3–1. Coutts was capped 8 times by Scotland U21, with his final appearance being on 11 October 2010, a 2–1 defeat in the second leg of the 2011 European under-21 Championship qualifying play-off against Icleand under-21, Scotland lost 4–2 on aggregate and missed out on qualifying for the main tournament.

Paul Ramadge

Paul Ramadge was editor-in-chief of "The Age", a daily newspaper in Melbourne, from 2008 to June 2012. 
During his tenure, Ramadge reinforced the newspaper's reputation for agenda-setting investigative journalism and strengthened its coverage of Victoria, the nation and, in some measure, the world. He was praised for recruiting and training the next generation of journalists, and for introducing digital innovations. An award-winning iPad app was launched, along with a host of website products. New social media, database and interactive forms of journalism were introduced. The Age was the PANPA Newspaper of the Year at the time of his departure. 
Other highlights of his editorship included forcing the Victorian Government to launch a parliamentary inquiry into sexual-abuse allegations against the clergy; a years-long investigation into allegations of bank note scams linked to the Reserve Bank of Australia; multi-media coverage – print, television and online – of state and federal election campaigns; and strong advocacy on climate change, asylum-seekers, and the need for progressive, innovative thinking at state and federal levels to reignite infrastructure developments in Australia.
The years 2008 to 2012 witnessed a severe tightening of the media market in Australia, and Ramadge was one of many editors forced to reduce staff numbers through voluntary redundancy programs.
Ramadge announced on June 25, 2012, that he was stepping down from his role, along with his Sydney Morning Herald counterparts, editor Amanda Wilson and publisher Peter Fray.

He began his singing career when he was 16, appearing in both Italy and Germany. His even greater success as a teacher led to an invitation in 1757 by Empress Maria Theresia of Austria to become "k. k. Cammer-Musicus" and thereby teach her daughters singing. In 1774 in Vienna he published an important book on singing "Pensieri, e riflessioni pratiche sopra il canto figurato". His views and publications brought him into conflict with another voice teacher, Vincenzo Manfredini. He remained in Vienna and died there as "Retired Singing Master", leaving behind a considerable fortune.

Madara (village)

Madara (, pronounced ) is a village in northeastern Bulgaria, part of Shumen municipality, Shumen Province. Madara lies east of the city of Shumen, at the western foot of the Madara plateau.
Madara is famous for the Madara National Historical and Archaeological Reserve east of the village, one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria. The reserve includes Neolithic and Eneolithic findings, a Thracian settlement, Ancient Roman villa and fortress from the 2nd–5th century, medieval Bulgarian palace, pagan sanctuaries, Christian churches and monasteries and fortresses from the First Bulgarian Empire. There is also a cave monastery from the 12th–14th century. Most importantly, Madara is the location of the famous Madara Rider, an early medieval (early 8th-century) large rock relief carved by the Bulgars and also featuring several epigraphs of historic importance written in Medieval Greek; the relief most likely dates to the reign of Tervel of Bulgaria.
The archaeological reserve was first studied by the Hungarian archaeologist Géza Fehér and then by the Czech-Bulgarian Karel Škorpil and the Bulgarian Rafail Popov.
In medieval times, the village was a Bulgarian fortress named "Matora". It was mentioned in Ottoman registers of 1481 as "Matara". The modern village was founded by settlers from nearby Kyulevcha close to Kaspichan after the Liberation of Bulgaria; in the 1940s and 1950s, settlers from the Pirin and Sofia regions arrived.
The truck building works in Shumen are named Madara after the archaeological reserve.

Mounted archery

A horse archer, horsed archer, or mounted archer is a cavalryman armed with a bow, able to shoot while riding from horseback. Archery has occasionally been used from the backs of other riding animals. Mounted archery was a defining characteristic of the Eurasian nomads during antiquity and the medieval period, including Iranian peoples (Scythians, Sarmatians, Sassanids) and Indians in antiquity, and by the Mongols and the Turkic peoples during the Middle Ages. 
By the expansion of these peoples, the practice also spread to Eastern Europe (via the Sarmatians and the Huns) and to East Asia.
In East Asia, horse archery came to be particularly honoured in the samurai tradition of Japan, where mounted archery is called Yabusame.
Mounted archery developed separately among the peoples of the South American pampas and the North American prairies; the Comanches were especially skilled.
Basic features.
The natives of large grassland areas developed mounted archery for hunting, and for war. The buffalo hunts of the North American prairies may have been the most spectacular and best-recorded examples of bowhunting by mounted archers.
Since using a bow requires the rider to let go of the reins with both hands, horse archers need superb equestrian skills if they are to shoot on the move.
Horse archers may be either light, such as Scythian, Hun, Parthian, Cuman or Pecheneg horsemen; or heavy, such as Byzantine kavallarioi, Russian druzhina and Japanese samurai. Some nations, like medieval Mongols and Hungarians, fielded both light and heavy cavalry. In some armies, such as those of the Parthians, Teutonic Order of Knights and Palmyrans, the mounted troops consisted of both super-heavy (cataphracts, knights) and ultra-light cavalry.
In battle, light horse archers were typically skirmishers; lightly armed missile troops capable of moving swiftly to avoid close combat or to deliver a rapid blow to the flanks or rear of the foe. In the tactic of the Parthian shot the rider would retreat from the enemy while turning his upper body and shooting backwards. Due to the superior speed of mounted archers, troops under attack from horse archers were unable to respond to the threat if they did not have ranged weapons of their own. Constant harassment would result in casualties, morale drop and disruption of the formation. Any attempts to charge the archers would also slow the entire army down.
An example comes from an attack on Comanche horse archers by Texas Rangers who were saved by their muzzle-loading firearms and by a convenient terrain feature. Captain John Bird rode up the Little River with fifty Rangers. They met some twenty Comanches hunting buffalo, and attacked them. The Comanches fled, easily keeping clear of the Rangers, for several miles across the open prairie before Bird noticed that he was now chasing some two hundred Indians. He immediately retreated, only to discover his classic error in fighting mounted archers. The Comanches pursued in turn, screaming and loosing what seemed like clouds of arrows. Bird's command happened across a ravine where they could shoot from cover. They fired carefully to keep the Indians at long range, always making sure they kept a few of their rifles loaded in case of an assault. The horse archers did not charge, but kept the Rangers under siege until seven of them, including Captain Bird, were dead or dying. The Rangers retreated to the east and claimed victory. Comanches set out on large-scale raids, destroying and torturing over a wide area.
Heavy horse archers, such as Byzantine kavallarioi, Turkish timariots or Japanese samurai, instead fought as disciplined units. Instead of harassing without ever making contact, they shot in volleys, weakening the enemy before they charged him. In addition to bows, they often also carried close combat weapons, such as lances or spears.
Appearance in history.
Mounted archery first developed during the Iron Age, gradually replacing the Bronze Age chariot.
The earliest depictions of mounted archers are found in artwork of the Neo-Assyrian Empire of about the 9th century BC and reflects the incursions of the early Iranian peoples.
Early horse archery, depicted on the Assyrian carvings, involved two riders, one controlling both horses while the second shot.
One of the commanders who won his first battle against an army including large numbers of horse archers was Alexander the Great, however, according to the Greek historian Herodotus, the Persian general Mardonius used mounted archers to attack and harass his opponents during the Battle of Plataea, which was won by the Greeks. Alexander defeated Scythians in 329 BC at the Battle of Jaxartes (the Syr Darya river). Even so, the Jaxartes marked the north-easternmost border of Alexander's realm in Asia, and he never ventured beyond into the heartlands of the horse nomads. However, Alexander was never interested in expanding his empire northwards since his main goal was to conquer the Persian empire and to reach the ”end of the world”, neither of which were found in North Asia. Prior to Alexander's Oriental campaign, Persian emperor Darius the Great had led a campaign against the mounted Scythians, who presumably out of fear of the Persian troops refused to engage in any battle, thus allowing Darius to conquer and occupy land without having to fight for it. Furthermore, Alexander the Great's father, king Philip of Macedon, scored an epic victory against the Scythians residing north of the Danube, killing their king and causing their kingdom to fall apart thereafter. Another example of combined troops scoring crushing victories against armies mostly of mounted archers is the highly successful Han campaign against the mounted Xiongnu nomads.
By contrast with the above mentioned successes of combined forces against armies mostly of mounted archers, the amateur general Crassus led a large army, with inadequate cavalry and missile troops, against Parthian horse archers and cataphracts and to catastrophe at the Battle of Carrhae. It should be noted, however, that well led Roman troops managed to score crushing defeats against the Parthians and even sacked the Parthian capital on three occasions.
The medieval Battle of Liegnitz is a classic example of horse archers contributing to the defeat of armoured troops, via demoralization and continued harassment. However, it is a fact that most historians subscribe to that the Mongols were employing Chinese fire weapons at the time, which diminishes the merits of mounted archery to the Mongol Empire's successful expansion.
Skirmishing requires vast areas of free space to run, manoeuvre and flee, and if the terrain is close, light horse archers can be charged and defeated easily. Light horse archers are also very vulnerable to foot archers and crossbowmen, who are smaller targets and can outshoot horsemen. Large armies very seldom relied solely on skirmishing mounted archers.
Heavy horse archers first appeared in the Assyrian army in the 7th century BC after abandoning the chariot warfare and formed a link between light skirmishing cavalrymen and heavy cataphract cavalry. The heavy horse archers usually had mail or lamellar armour and helmets, and sometimes even their horses were armoured. Heavy horse archers, instead of skirmishing and hit-and-run tactics, formed in disciplined formations and units, sometimes intermixed with lancers as in Byzantine and Turkish armies, and shot as volleys instead of shooting as individuals. The usual tactic was to first shoot five or six volleys at the enemy to weaken him and to disorganise them, and then charge. Heavy horse archers often carried spears or lances for close combat, or formed mixed units with lancers. 
The Mongol armies and others included both heavy and light horse archers.
Heavy horse archers could usually outshoot their light counterparts, and wearing armour, could stand their shooting. The Russian druzhina cavalry developed as a countermeasure to the Tatar light troops. Likewise, the Turkish timariots and qapikulu were often as heavily armoured as Western knights, and could stand the Hungarian, Albanian and Mongol horse archers.
The German and Scandinavian Medieval armies made extensive use of mounted crossbowmen. They would act not only as scouts and skirmishers, but also protecting the flanks of the knights and infantry, and chasing away the enemy light cavalry. When the battle was fully engaged, they would charge at the enemy flank, shoot a single devastating volley at point-blank range and then attack the enemy with swords, without reloading. The invention of ratchet cranequin allowed the mounted crossbowmen to use heavy crossbows on horseback.
Decline of mounted archery.
Mounted archery was usually ineffective against massed foot archery. The foot archers or crossbowmen could outshoot the horse archers and a man alone is a smaller target than a man and a horse. The Crusaders countered the Turkoman horse archery with their crossbowmen, and Genoese crossbowmen were favoured mercenaries in both Mamluk and Mongol armies. Likewise the Chinese armies consisted of massed crossbowmen to counter the nomad armies. A nomad army that wanted to engage in an archery exchange with foot archers would itself normally dismount. The typical Mongol archer shot from a sitting position when dismounted.
Horse archers were eventually rendered obsolete by the development of modern firearms. In the 16th and subsequent centuries, various cavalry forces armed with firearms gradually started appearing. Because the conventional arquebus and musket were too awkward for a cavalryman to use, lighter weapons such as the carbine had to be developed, that could be effectively used from horseback, much in the same manner as the composite recurve bow presumably developed from earlier bows. 16th-century Dragoons and Carabiniers were heavier cavalry equipped only with firearms, but pistols coexisted with the composite bow, often used by the same rider, well into the 17th century in Eastern European cavalry such as Muscovites, Kalmycks, Turks and Cossacks. Mounted archery remained an effective tactical system in open country until the introduction of repeating firearms. The Comanches of North America found their bows more effective than muzzle loading guns. "After... about 1800, most Comanches began to discard muskets and pistols and to rely on their older weapons." Bows were still used in the fighting that ended the freedom of Native Americans in the United States, but almost all warriors who had immediate access to modern firearms used their guns instead.
Technology.
The weapon of choice for Eurasian horse archers was most commonly a composite recurve bow, because it was compact enough to shoot conveniently from a horse while retaining sufficient range and penetrating power. North Americans used short wooden bows often backed with sinew, but never developed the full three-layer composite bow.
Modern revival of mounted archery.
Mounted archery and associated skills were revived in Mongolia after independence in 1921 and are displayed at festivals, in particular the Naadam. Despite the formidable history of Mongolian horse archers, the sport is very limited in Mongolia itself today and at most Naadam festivals the archery and horse-riding competitions are conducted independently; the horses are raced with one another, and the archery is traditionally practiced from a standing position rather than mounted. In the past five years a desire to revive the tradition seems to have been addressed with the foundation of the Mongolian Horseback Archery Association whose members have competed in South Korea and Europe.
Horseback archery has also been revived by Kassai Lajos and other modern Hungarians. European horseback archery as a growing sport and equestrian skill is principally based on the Kassai, or "Hungarian" system. There are several competitions and meetings around the world in any given year – mostly in Hungary, Germany and other Central European countries, but also in Canada (Mt Currie, BC), the United States and also in South Korea. Amongst participants of this growing sport there is a dream of one day finding acceptance as an Olympic equestrian event.
Kassai school of horseback archery.
A horseback archery competition course, as defined by Kassai, is ninety nine meters long. There is one target with a rotating face on the course at its center point – its diameter is ninety centimeters. An electronic timing system gives the archer a maximum of 20 seconds to cover the course; to encourage speed as well as accuracy, the number of seconds less than 20 is added to the score reached on the targets. Any traditional bow or a modern fiberglass replica can be used, and with the exception of the nocking point, use of any other devices is strictly forbidden.
Please see here for a pictorial presentation of the Competition Course.
Hungarian technique.
Originally the Scythians, Parthians, Persians, Mongols and the Turkish archers all used variants of a thumb ring and they released arrows from 'inside' the bow. (For example, for a right-handed archer holding the bow in their left hand, the arrow sits across the left hand's thumb and on the right side of the bow.) Kassai, however, uses the later, Western method of shooting 'around the bow' and a three-fingered release (for a right-handed archer, the arrow rests over the back of the left hand holding the bow, and is released round the left side of the bow).
The bows are generally fairly light (from about 30 – 40 lbs) and Kassai uses carbon arrows rather than the more traditional wooden shafts. The 'release' has been significantly modified from a traditional Western release and involves a rather emphatic extension of the release hand (the right hand in the case of a right-handed archer) after releasing the arrow. This helps balance on horseback by allowing a slower adjustment to the transfer of momentum as the arrow leaves the bow.
For fast shooting, Kassai has developed a technique of holding up to a dozen arrows in the bow-hand from which the archer can reload quickly. Kassai's research has shown that the process of pulling arrows from a back quiver or saddle quiver is too cumbersome and slow - it is not known how the Mongols or their predecessors managed the task as no records remain. Kassai places great emphasis on this technique and can shoot up to 12 arrows in 17.80 seconds, while mounted.
Kassai places great emphasis on horsemanship. The aspiring horseback archer must first practice 'bare-back' (without any saddle) to develop good balance. Once past a certain level the archer may graduate to use a specially modified Eastern Saddle. Previously it was thought that the optimum time to release the arrow was rising in the stirrups at the height of the horse's rise in the canter, but as is regularly demonstrated the archer can shoot without stirrups (although generally the top of the rise, when all four horse's hooves are out of contact with the ground, is still the best point for release.)
Traditional Korean school.
Korea has a tradition of horseback archery. In 2007, the Korean government passed a law to preserve and encourage development of traditional Korean martial arts, including horseback archery.
In Korean archery competitions there are five disciplines that are competed separately. The major difference in Korean archery is that all arrows must be stowed somewhere on the archer or horse, unlike Hungarian style where the archer can take the arrows from the bow hand. Traditionally this is a quiver on the right thigh, but it may also be through a belt, a sash, a saddle quiver or even held in a boot or arm quiver.
The first competition is a single shot to the side. The track is long (as in the Hungarian method) but carries only one target set back around 5–10m from the track. This has a unique fascia that consists of five square concentric rings which increase in point score from the outer to inner; the inner (often decorated with a 'Tiger' face) is worth the maximum five points. Each archer has two passes to complete, and each run has to be completed within 16 seconds (or penalty points are incurred).
The next competition is very similar but is known as the "double shot" which features one target in the first 30m, slightly angled forwards, and a second target in the last 30m, slightly angled backwards.
The final competition for the static targets is the "serial shot" which consists of five targets evenly spaced along a track, approximately one target every or so. In all three static target competitions, additional bonus points are awarded for style and form.
Another major difference in Korean archery style is the "Mogu", or moving target competition. This consists of one rider towing a large cotton-and-bamboo ball behind their horse while another archer attempts to shoot the ball (with special turnip-headed arrows which have been dipped in ink). The archer attempts to hit the ball as many times as possible. A second "Mo Gu" event consists of a team of two trying to hit the target towed by a third rider. Points are awarded for how many arrows strike the ball (verified by the ink stains on the Mogu).
Traditional Japanese horseback archery.
The history of Japanese horseback archery dates back to the 4th century. It became popular in Japan, attracting crowds. The Emperor found that the crowds were not appropriate to the solemn and sacred nature of the occasion, and banned public displays in 698. Horseback archery was a widely used combat technique from the Heian Period to the Sengoku Period. Nasu no Yoichi, a samurai of the Kamakura Period is the most famous horseback archer in Japan. Three kinds of Japanese horseback archery (Kasagake, Yabusame, and Inuoumono (dog shooting)) were defined.
When the arquebus was introduced to Japan in the 16th century, archery became outdated. To maintain traditional Japanese horseback archery, Tokugawa Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa shogun, ordered the Ogasawara clan to found a school. Current Japanese horseback archery succeeds to the technique reformed by the Ogasawara clan.
Traditionally, women were barred from performing in yabusame, but in 1963 female archers participated in a yabusame demonstration for the first time.

Sir Charles Swann, 1st Baronet

Sir Charles Ernest Swann, 1st Baronet, (25 January 1844 – 13 July 1929) was a British businessman and Liberal Party politician.
He was born as Charles Ernest Schwann, fifth son of J Frederick Schwann of Gloucester Square, London (and originally from Frankfurt, Germany) and Henrietta Kell of Birmingham. His father carried on business in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and Charles received his early education in the town. He subsequently attended Owen's College, Manchester and University College, London.
Swann became a merchant in Manchester, and became a leading member of the Liberal movement in the city. He was, by turn, the secretary, treasurer and president of the Manchester Liberal Federation. He was also president of the Manchester Reform Club and for nine years president of the National Reform Union.
In 1885 he was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the new constituency of Manchester North. However, another general election was held in the following year, and Swann was elected as member of parliament. He was to remain Manchester North's MP until 1918. He was regarded as an "advanced radical", and took an interest in the constitutional affairs of India, attending the opening of the National Indian Congress in 1890.
In 1906 Charles Schwann was created a baronet "of Prince's Gardens in the Royal Borough of Kensington" and in 1911 he was as appointed to the Privy Council. In 1913 Schwann changed his surname to Swann by royal licence.
He married Elizabeth Duncan in 1876, and they had four sons and a daughter. Sir C E Swann died at his residence in Birkdale, Lancashire in 1929, aged 85. He was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.

Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch

The Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (abbrev. B.A.J.) is an astronomical ephemeris almanac and the longest publication series in astronomy. It was a compendium of ephemerides of all large Solar system bodies and of fundamental stars which define the celestial reference system.
The "B.A.J." series began in 1776 and continued until 1960 when it was included into the international edition of the "Astronomical Ephemeris" and of "Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars" (APFS). This merger was decided in 1959 by the IAU.
At least the Yearbook had a volume of about 500 pages; starting in 1907 it contained accurate apparent places of the first international fundamental catalogue which was compiled for astrometry; later these data were actualized within the framework of the Catalogues of Fundamental Stars FK3 and FK4.
In the 1940s the Almanac was edited in co-operation with the "Astronomisch-Geodätisches Jahrbuch" of the Recheninstitut in Heidelberg, Germany, which was merged also into the IAU editions like other national almanacs.

Seneca Valley Virus or Senecavirus
is a replication-competent oncolytic picornavirus. SVV-001 has selective tropism for cancers with neuroendocrine features including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and several pediatric solid tumors including retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma. A Phase I clinical trial of SVV-001 in adults with neuroendocrine tumors showed that SVV-001 is apparently safe to administer at doses up to 1E11 vp/kg.
It has potential antineoplastic activity.
Discovery and Origin of Seneca Valley VIrus.
The complete genome sequence of SVV-001 was competed in 2008.
An infectious clone of SVV-001 was reported in 2012.
Seneca Valley virus has been proposed to attack cancer stem cells.
Diagnostic monoclonal antibodies have been generated against Seneca Valley virus.
It has been suggested that not enough safety information is yet available. This determination was made prior to results of the phase I clinical trial being published.
While the sequence of SVV proteins is most similar to cardioviruses, the non-coding internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) is most similar to those of pestviruses including classical swine fever virus.
Clinical Trials.
The initial isolate, SVV-001, is being developed as an anti-cancer therapeutic by virtual company Neotropix, Inc. under the name NTX-010.
Phase I
Phase II
Virus replication.
It is believed that SVV-001 internalizes by receptor-mediated internalization, but as yet no host receptor has been identified.

Rhené-Baton

René-Emmanuel Baton, known as Rhené-Baton, (5 September 1879 – 23 September 1940) was a French conductor and composer. Though born in Courseulles-sur-Mer, Normandy, his family originated in Vitré in nearby Brittany. He returned to the region at the age of 19, and many of his compositions express his love of the area. He also had close relationships with composers of the Breton cultural renaissance, notably Guy Ropartz, Paul Le Flem, Paul Ladmirault and Louis Aubert. As a conductor he was notable for his attempts to expand appreciation of classical music.
Conducting career.
He studied piano at the Paris Conservatory and learned music theory under André Gedalge. He began his career as a "chef de chant" at the Opera-Comique in 1907. He was then appointed as musical director of various orchestral groups, notably the "Society of Saint Cecilia" in Bordeaux and Angers "Société populaire" (1910–1912).
In 1910 he was chosen to head the "Festival of French music" in Munich in Germany. Serge Diaghilev requested that he conduct the Ballets Russes in London and South America (1912–1913). During World War I he was the head of the Dutch Royal Opera (1916–1918) and held summer concerts of the "Orchestra in Residence of the Hague" in Scheveningen (1914–1919).
Serge Sandberg entrusted him with the direction of the Pasdeloup concert (the French "Proms") the mission of which was to democratize access to music, providing commentary and analysis prior to the performance of works. He organized this event until 1932, and continued to lead the orchestra until the end of his life. He died on 23 September 1940, at Le Mans.
Premieres.
He created the first performances of a number of notable musical works:
Albert Roussel dedicated to him his 2nd Symphony (1923), and Arthur Honegger "Le Chant de Nigamon" (1918).
Compositions.
Rhené-Baton composed pieces for orchestra, chamber ensembles and a large number of piano works. His "6 Songs for Marycinthe" were created at the request of Maurice Duhamel. Breton subjects appear frequently in his works, such as "Au pardon de Rumengol", "En Bretagne", "Vieille chapelle en Cornouaille". He also set to music the poems of Auguste Brizeux (Le Clocher) and Louis Tiercelin (Chansons bretonnes). Some of his works were influenced by the vogue for orientalism at the time.

2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package

A bank rescue package totalling some £500 billion (approximately $850 billion) was announced by the British government on 8 October 2008, as a response to the ongoing global financial crisis. After two unsteady weeks at the end of September, the first week of October had seen major falls in the stock market and severe worries about the stability of British banks. The plan aimed to restore market confidence and help stabilise the British banking system, and provided for a range of short-term loans and guarantees of interbank lending, as well as up to £50 billion of state investment in the banks themselves.
Background.
The announcement occurred less than 48 hours after Britain's leading share index, the FTSE100, recorded its largest single-day points fall since 1987. A similar bailout package had been passed in the United States the previous week, as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Details of the rescue package were worked on overnight and were finalised at 05:00.
The rescue plan.
The plan provides for several sources of funding to be made available, to an aggregate total of £500 billion in loans and guarantees. Most simply, £200 billion will be made available for short terms loans through the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme. Secondly, the Government will support British banks in their plan to increase their market capitalisation through the newly formed Bank Recapitalisation Fund, by £25 billion in the first instance with a further £25 billion to be called upon if needed. Thirdly, the Government will temporarily underwrite any eligible lending between British banks, giving a loan guarantee of around £250 billion. However, only £400 billion of this is 'fresh money', as there is already in place a system for short term loans to the value of £100 billion.
Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told the House of Commons in a statement on 8 October 2008 that the proposals were "designed to restore confidence in the banking system", and that the funding would "put the banks on a stronger footing". Prime Minister Gordon Brown suggested that the government's actions had 'led the way' for other nations to follow whilst Shadow Chancellor George Osborne stated that "This is the final chapter of the age of irresponsibility and it’s absolutely extraordinary that a government has been driven by events to today's announcement"; in addition to offering opposition support for the plan.
Also on the 8 October 2008 there was a strategic and co-ordinated global effort by seven central banks to calm the current financial crisis, by cutting interest rates by 0.5%. The banks were all members of the OECD and included The Bank of England, The European Central Bank and the U.S Federal reserve along with central banks in China, Switzerland, Canada and Sweden. In a reaction to the move, European stock exchanges began to recover from the losses they had made after trading had opened. The decision to make the cut came after exchanges in the Far East closed on a day of heavy losses.
The British rescue plan differs from the $700bn US bailout formally entitled the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), in that the £50bn being invested by the UK Government will see them purchasing shares in the banks (which in the future could see a return being made to the taxpayer), whereas the American program is primarily devoted to the U.S. government purchasing the mortgage backed securities of the American banks which are not able to be sold in the secondary mortgage securities market. The U.S. program does require the U.S. government to take an equity interest in financial organisations selling their securities into the TARP The U.S. programme therefore does not address the fundamental solvency problem faced by the banking sector, but rather is aimed at tackling the immediate funding shortfall; the UK package tackles both solvency, through the £50bn recapitalisation plan, and funding, through the government guarantee for banks' debt issuances and the expansion of the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme.
Capital investment.
Through the Bank Recapitalisation Fund, the government will buy a combination of ordinary shares and preference shares in affected banks. The amount and proportion of the stake that will be taken in any one bank is to be negotiated with the individual bank. Banks that take the rescue packages will have restrictions on executive pay and dividends to existing shareholders, as well as a mandate to offer reasonable credit to homeowners and small businesses. The long-term government plan is to offset the cost of this program by receiving dividends from these shares, and in the long run, to sell the shares after a market recovery. This plan may potentially extend to underwriting new issues of shares by any participating bank. The plan has been characterised as, in effect, partial nationalisation.
The extent to which different banks participate will vary according to their needs. HSBC Group issued a statement announcing it was injecting £750 m of capital into the UK bank and therefore has "no plans to utilise the UK government's recapitalisation initiative ... the Group remains one of the most strongly capitalised and liquid banks in the world". Standard Chartered also declared its support for the scheme but its intention not to participate in the capital injection element. Barclays intends to raise £6.5 billion from private investors, and will cancel its final dividend for the year for a net saving of £2 billion.
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group will raise £20 billion from the Bank Recapitalisation Fund, with £5 billion in preference shares and a further £15 billion being issued as ordinary shares. HBOS and Lloyds TSB will together raise £17 billion, £8.5 billion in preference shares and a further £8.5 billion issue of ordinary shares. The Fund will purchase the preference shares outright, for a total £13.5 billion investment, and will underwrite the issues of ordinary shares; should they not be taken up by private investors, the Fund will undertake to purchase them. If none of the new stock is taken up, this would give the Government an overall holding of 60% of the Royal Bank of Scotland, with 40% of the merged HBOS-Lloyds, held as a mixture of preference and ordinary stock.
Participating banks.
The plan is open to all UK incorporated banks and all building societies, including the following:
However, of these, Abbey, Barclays, Clydesdale, HSBC, Nationwide, and Standard Chartered have chosen not to receive any government money, leaving Lloyds and RBS as the only major recipients.
Reactions.
Paul Krugman the Nobel Prize winner for Economics stated in his New York Times column that "Mr Brown and Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer have defined the character of the worldwide rescue effort, with other wealthy nations playing catch-up." He also stated that "Luckily for the world economy... Gordon Brown and his officials are making sense... And they may have shown us the way through this crisis." 
The British banking bail-out example was closely followed by the rest of Europe, as well as the U.S Government, who on the 14 October 2008 announced a $250bn (£143bn) plan to purchase stakes in a wide variety of banks in an effort to restore confidence in the sector. The money came from the $700bn bail-out package approved by U.S. lawmakers earlier that month. 
A wave of international action to address the financial crisis had at last an effect on stock markets around the world. Although shares in the affected banks fell, the Dow Jones went up by more than 900 points, or 11.1 per cent, while London shares also bounced back, with the FTSE100 Index closing more than 8 per cent higher on the 13 October 2008.

Football Romeo

Football Romeo is a 1938 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by George Sidney. It was the 173rd "Our Gang" short (174th episode, 85th talking short, 86th talking episode, and fifth MGM produced episode) that was released.
Plot.
The gang squares off against "Butch's Assassins" in a crucial football game. Star player Carl Alfalfa balks at participating, leaving it up to Darla to coerce and cajole him into donning his uniform. The climax of the game finds Alfalfa attempting a sixty-yard touchdown, despite the formidable opposition of his lifelong rival Butch.
Notes.
Another episode, very similar to a Hal Roach film, "Football Romeo" benefited from the comedy expertise of uncredited script contributor Jack White, who directed many Three Stooges films for at Columbia Pictures.

Daisy Lowe

Daisy Rebecca Lowe (born 27th January 1989) is an English fashion model who has modelled for editorial photo shoots and commercial advertising campaigns and has worked as a catwalk model. She is the daughter of Pearl Lowe, the singer-songwriter turned textile and fashion designer, and Gavin Rossdale, lead singer for Bush.
Career.
Lowe began modelling at the age of two, and did some photoshoots when she was 12 and 14 years old. At 15 she was approached by a talent scout in Camden Town and, as a result, she signed with Select, a London modelling agency.
In February 2006, Lowe was featured in "Italian Vogue", shot by New York photographer Steven Klein, who also shot her in March 2007 for a "W" magazine pictorial called "Xurbia". In September 2006, Lowe modelled for the Urban Outfitters catalogue, appeared in French Connection printed advertisements and was profiled in British "Harper's Bazaar". She was featured in an editorial in "Jane" magazine alongside fellow model Lydia Hearst-Shaw in March 2007, appeared in "Italian Vogue" for the second time in May, and in August, posed nude on the cover of "i-D" magazine with her then-partner, Will Cameron of the band Blondelle, photographed by Terry Richardson.
On the runway, Lowe was selected by Karl Lagerfeld to model for Chanel, and has appeared on catwalks in New York, Milan and London for Topshop and designers such as PPQ, Nanette Lepore, Sue Stemp, Charlotte Ronson, Henry Holland, and Vivienne Westwood. She has modelled for Agent Provocateur lingere for the past three years, and has been used by Burberry, Converse shoes, Dr. Martens, Hooch, Wheels and Doll Baby, Ben Sherman, Frost French, Hari, Karen Millen, Diesel SpA and Whistles, as well as for her mother's recent collection of lace dresses.
Of the Whistles campaign, Lowe said, " was a favourite shoot of mine... Modelling is a cool outlet for me to express myself, and fashion has always fascinated me. I love that fashion crosses into my other passions – music and art."
Lowe's magazine work includes editorials and covers of publications such as "Tatler", "Elle", "GQ", "Vogue", "Paradis", "Marie Claire", "Interview", "Jalouse", "Teen Vogue", "Dirty Glam", "Grazia", "In Style", "Nylon" and "The Sunday Times Style" amongst many others.
She has recently appeared in campaigns for Marc by Marc Jacobs, Louis Vuitton, Pringle of Scotland, DKNY, Mango and Esprit.
Lowe has some experience in other media, including being the focus of the BBC Two eight-part fly on the wall documentary series "Class of 2008", co-hosting "Glamour"'s "Best Dressed 2008" with Peaches Geldof for Fiver, and a brief contribution to a blog for "Elle" UK online. Lowe has worked as a DJ, appeared in the music videos "NYC Beat" by Armand Van Helden and "Bloodthirsty Bastards" by Dirty Pretty Things, hosted events for "Tommy Hilfiger" and "Dolce and Gabbana", and in April 2008 made a recording in a New York studio with producer Mark Ronson, with whom she had a brief romantic relationship.
2009 also saw Lowe feature in "The First Days of Spring", Noah and the Whale's film accompaniment to their second album.
She was chosen to be in the 2010 Pirelli Calendar photographed by Terry Richardson in Bahia, Brazil. Throughout May 2010 Daisy documented her daily fashion and style choices for Vogue.co.uk's "Today I'm Wearing" feature. In August 2010, Lowe became the face of the newly relaunched Sixties label Biba. She is also the face of Stephen Webster's 2011 jewellery campaign.
In 2011, Daisy went topless for Esquire and nude for Playboy. Also, in 2011, she was featured in Miles Kane's music video "Come Closer".
Personal life.
Lowe grew up in Primrose Hill, North London, and stayed with grandparents to continue her education at South Hampstead High School when her mother, Pearl Lowe, moved to Hampshire. Lowe dated producer Mark Ronson, but broke up after a row. She has since been linked with Tinie Tempah. She also had a relationship with Matt Smith, best known as the Eleventh Doctor on Doctor Who, which ended in 2011 due to work commitments.
Until 2004, Lowe was believed to be the daughter of Pearl Lowe's ex-husband Bronner Lowe, but a paternity test revealed that her godfather, Bush singer/guitarist Gavin Rossdale, was in fact her biological father. Her mother Pearl Lowe wrote about the situation in her book, "All That Glitters." Daisy's paternity was not questioned early on, and Pearl listed "Bronner Lowe" on Daisy's birth certificate. At age 14, Daisy found out neither Bronner nor her mother shared her O-type blood. She mistakenly thought that one parent must share her blood type and that Bronner couldn't be her father (based on a common misunderstanding of blood type inheritance). Daisy confronted her mother, who admitted to a one-night affair with Rossdale. Daisy and Pearl's lawyers arranged a paternity test, which Rossdale at first refused. Results confirmed Rossdale was her father.
At 16, Lowe said of the press, 
In 2013 Lowe learned Transcendental Meditation, and said London Fashion Week that year "was so much less stressful, so much more fun. I wasn't taking it all on so much."

Goldschläger

Goldschläger is a Swiss cinnamon schnapps (43.5% alcohol by volume or 87 proof; originally it was 53.5% alcohol or 107 proof), a liqueur with very thin, yet visible flakes of gold floating in it. The actual amount of gold has been measured at approximately 13 mg in a 1-Litre bottle of Goldschläger. As of November 2012 this amounts to €0.56 EUR or lower on the international gold market.
Goldschläger was produced in Switzerland until the 1990s, when the brand was acquired by Diageo, which continued production of Goldschläger schnapps in Italy. Since 2008 it is a brand of Global Brands and produced in Switzerland again. The German word "Goldschläger" ("gold beater") designates the profession of gold leaf makers, who beat bars of gold into micrometre-thin sheets.
It is said to be a competitor with other high potency cinnamon-based elixirs including Fireball Cinnamon Whisky by Sazerac Company, DeKuyper Hot Damn! (liqueur), Hood River Distillers SinFire Cinnamon Whisky, and Red Stag Spiced by Jim Beam.
It is one of many cinnamon-infused liquors on the market. See Fireball and discussion therein.
In popular culture.
In "Psych" episode 2.11, Gus (Dule Hill) claims that a woman got him to marry her by saying "three little words: 'Let's try Goldschläger!
In the 2006 movie "Beerfest", the characters are trying to recall the secret location of the competition. Having been training for a drinking competition all year long, they are unable to reach the appropriate state of inebriation with beer alone. Turning to a bottle of Goldschläger, Todd Wolfhouse (Eric Stolhanske) drinks the entire bottle, leaving him with gold lips and the correct level of drunkenness to lead the rest of the American drinking team to the competition.
Goldschläger is parodied in the 2007 film "Superbad" by a fictional drink called Goldslick Vodka, and again in the 2007 "Bones" episode "The Girl in the Gator" buys a type of schnapps called Goldenrod, the description of which is virtually identical to Goldschläger.
In the 2012 movie "The Campaign" Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) says at the dinner table "I was plied with copious amounts of Red Bull, jello shots and Goldschläger. Do you remember Dr.Jenkins? He thought I had Crohn's disease. There were flakes of 24 carat gold in my stool for about a month... I crapped GOLD!".
It is also referred to in the song "Hell raisin' heat of the summer" by Florida Georgia Line with the line "and the gold flakes glimmer in the cinnamon booze"

Philipps House

Philipps House is an early nineteenth-century Neo-Grecian country house at Dinton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. The house was designed by Jeffry Wyatt, later Sir Jeffry Wyatville for William Wyndham (1769-1841), and was built between 1814 and 1817 on the site of an earlier, demolished seventeenth-century house, Dinton House, which had been the Wyndham family home since 1689. The new house was also called Dinton House, and was known as this until 1917 when foreclosure proceedings were brought against Dinton House and its estate. 
The estate was bought by Bertram Erasmus Philipps (1870-1947), a descendant of the Philipps baronets of Picton Castle (1621 creation), who renamed the house after himself. He was High Sheriff of Wilshire in 1923.
In 1936, Philipps leased the house to the YWCA as a retreat, and they remained there until 1995. Philipps moved to nearby Hyde's House, a former rectory which he had bought in 1924 and where he lived until his death. During World War II, the park in front of Philipps house was requisitioned for use by the United States Army Air Force, who erected a number of Nissen huts there. In 1943 Philipps gave the house and of parkland to the National Trust, along with Hyde's House as well as a number of paintings owned by the Wyndham and Philipps families.
The house is built of Chilmark stone, a local building stone also used for Salisbury Cathedral, and Wyatt is believed to have based his design on Pythouse, some seven miles (11 km) away at Newtown, near Tisbury. The house is two-storied with symmetrically set chimney stacks and a central lantern. The main (south) front has nine bays with an Ionic portico. The rooms are planned around a spacious square hall with an imperial staircase to the first floor. The house is one of the first in England to have a central heating system installed. This was achieved by pumping hot air from a boiler in the basement into the stairwell. Now open to the public, the house contains an impressive collection of Regency furniture and furnishings. The house is Grade II* listed. 
After the YWCA left in 1995, the National Trust did a thorough refurbishing of the house, which is leased to a tenant family but open to the public on two days a week. The parkland that surrounds the house is still known as Dinton Park, and it also has been restored.

Lawrence Wright (composer)

Lawrence Wright (15 February 1888 – 19 May 1964) was a British popular music composer and publisher. He was born in Leicester and opened a music shop in the city in 1906. A short time later his first song, "Down By The Stream", was published, and by 1912 he had established the Lawrence Wright Music Co in Denmark Street, London.
Wright went on to write (or co-write) over 600 songs under his own name and as Horatio Nicholls, including the World War I propaganda song "Are We Downhearted? No!", and would receive an Ivor Novello Award in 1962 for Outstanding Contribution to British Popular Music. He was one of the very rare composers of popular music in this period to make a substantial amount of money - it had not been unusual to see composers who had written dozens of hits die in poverty.
In 1927, Wright appeared in a short film made in the DeForest Phonofilm with excerpts of his revue "Sensations of 1927".
His 1927 collaboration with Edgar Leslie, "Among My Souvenirs", has been covered by artists including Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Judy Garland, and Connie Francis.
Wright founded "Melody Maker" magazine in 1926. He moved to Blackpool in the early 1920s and became a show promoter. Running "On With The Show" on the North Pier for a record-breaking 32 years (1924 - 1956). He lived in a mock castle house, later called the Castle Casino, on Blackpool's North Promenade. After he began using a wheelchair, he moved to a bungalow in Carlin Gate. Upon being recently sold, much memorabilia was discovered at the address including posters, bills, letters, sheet music and musical scores.

Gheorghiu

Gheorghiu (pronounced ɡe̯orˈɡi.u, see IPA pronunciation details) is a Romanian surname, of Greek language origin, deriving from Greek "Γεωργίου". Among Greeks, the Greek surname form "Γεωργίου" is usually or always Romanized in other ways, either as "Gheorghiou" or "Georgiou". 
The Gheorghiu surname is patronymic (from the Greek genitive), meaning "son of George". In Romanian, the name George exists in two spellings and two different pronunciations: "George" with two soft g sounds (George, written as "g" in Romanian) and "Gheorghe" with two hard g sounds (Gheorghe, written as "gh" in Romanian, as in Italian and some other languages), the hard g sounds that are also found in "Gheorghiu".
In Romanian, the name "George" is a two-syllable name pronounced jor'je (written George), not a one-syllable name as in English jorj (written George). The name "Gheorghe" is also two-syllable, pronounced with hard g sounds: gior'ge, and with an added "i" (gior-) sound not found in jor'je.

The winners of the competition qualified for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League. Vllaznia were the defending champions.
The rounds were played in a two-legged format similar to those of European competitions. If the aggregated score was tied after both games, the team with the higher number of away goals advanced. If the number of away goals was equal in both games, the match was decided by extra time and a penalty shootout, if necessary.
Preliminary Tournament.
In order to reduce the number of participating teams for the First Round to 32, a preliminary tournament was played. Only teams from the Second Division (III) were allowed to enter. Each Second Division group played its own tournament. In contrast to the main tournament, the preliminary tournament was held as a single-leg knock-out competition.

Dickie Baugh, Jr

Richard "Dickie" Baugh, Jr. (6 March 1896 – 1972) was an English footballer who played for both Black Country clubs, Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. He was the son of Dickie Baugh who also represented the former.
Baugh began his career with the Wolverhampton-based Stafford Road before joining Wolves in August 1918. With league football suspended due to World War I until the following year, he had to wait until 18 October 1919 to make his debut, in a 0–1 defeat to Bury.
He battled for his spot in defence with Jackery Jones over his first seasons, but played every round of the club's route to the 1921 FA Cup Final. However, Baugh was injured in the weeks leading up to the game and missed their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. With Jones having retired at the end of the season, Baugh made the spot his own and was a near ever-present over the next season and-a-half until suffering injury.
Baugh remained on the club's books until June 1924 when he moved to their rivals West Bromwich Albion after making 120 appearances in total for Wolves. He made his Albion debut in February 1925 in a First Division match against Preston North End. In May 1929 he joined Exeter City, before a transfer to Kidderminster Harriers in January 1932. He remained with Kidderminster until his retirement from football in April 1936. 
He died in 1972.

2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis

The 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis was a major economic and political event in Iceland that involved the collapse of all three of the country's major privately owned commercial banks, following their difficulties in refinancing their short-term debt and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland’s systemic banking collapse is the largest experienced by any country in economic history.
In late September 2008, it was announced that the Glitnir bank would be nationalised. The following week on 7 October 2008, control of Landsbanki and Glitnir was handed over to receivers appointed by the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME). Two days later, the same organization placed Iceland's largest bank, Kaupthing, into receivership as well. Commenting on the need for emergency measures, Prime Minister Geir Haarde said on 6 October, "There a very real danger... that the Icelandic economy, in the worst case, could be sucked with the banks into the whirlpool and the result could have been national bankruptcy." He also stated that the actions taken by the government had ensured that the Icelandic state would not actually go bankrupt. At the end of the second quarter 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 80% of which was held by the banking sector. This value compares with Iceland's 2007 gross domestic product of 1.293 trillion krónur (€8.5 billion). The assets of the three banks taken under the control of the FME totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at the end of the second quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times of the Icelandic GDP, and hence there was no possibility for the Icelandic Central Bank to step in as a lender of last resort when they were hit by financial troubles and started to account asset losses. As part of the urgently passed emergency law on 6 October, the path forward for the receivership held banks was dictated to be a secretion of all domestic assets into new surviving public owned domestic versions of the banks, while leaving the foreign remainings of the banks into receivership and liquidation. This move worked as a protecting hand for the Icelandic economy, as it meant that the domestic residents would not suffer any losses from the systemic bank failure.
However, the financial crisis still had a serious negative impact on the Icelandic economy. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, and the market capitalisation of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As a result of the crisis, Iceland underwent a severe economic recession; the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) dropped by 5.5% in real terms in the first six months of 2010. Outside Iceland, more than half a million depositors (far more than the entire population of Iceland) found their bank accounts frozen, as a result of the foreign branches of the three Icelandic banks were thrown into receivership; and a subsequent diplomatic dispute (known as the "Icesave dispute") also evolved over repayment of deposit insurance between Iceland at one side versus United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
The main countermeasures to combat the crisis were:
The window with bailout support for the Icelandic state officially ended on 31 August 2011, without being extended with new extra loans or Precautionary Conditioned Credit Lines. As originally planned by IMF, Iceland instead managed indeed to regain complete access to financial markets to cover its future funding needs, and in first half of 2012 started to repay some of the established bailout debt. As of January 2013, the enforced capital controls is however still needed to protect the currency, and although it is being recommended by IMF to be lifted (in order to pave the way for foreign investments entering into the Icelandic territory), they also preach it should not happen before the Balance of Payments is entirely stable and the central bank has succeeded to build up a substantial foreign capital reserve (or sterilized some excessive amounts of ISK in circulation). In regards of repayment of minimum deposit guarantees from the receiverships of the three failed banks, these can now according to the latest 2012 accounts, theoretically be fully repaid through the liquidation of their assets - because the Icelandic law grant an exclusive first priority for repayment of these guarantees before the remaining priority claims and general claims from creditors are dealt with. As of September 2013 this was fully done by the Landsbanki receivership holding 97% of their assets in foreign currency, while the two other receiverships holding the majority of their assets in ISK currency was still blocked to start any repayment - due to the still in force Icelandic capital controls.
A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit after being up at 10% of GDP in 2009 and 2010, has now also been brought back to a more acceptable level at 3.4% of GDP in 2012; which along the way created the basis for the debt-to-GDP ratio to decline from its maximum at 101% in 2011 to 97% in 2012. The remaining challenges for the economy as of January 2013, is to lower its relatively high level of HICP inflation rate (which increased to 6.0% in 2012), and to lower the depreciation pressures against its national currency.
The Icelandic Financial Crisis is commonly referred to have officially ended 31 August 2011, which was the day where the international bailout support programme led by IMF officially ended.
Development.
Currency.
The Icelandic króna had declined more than 35% against the euro from January to September 2008. Inflation of consumer prices was running at 14%, and Iceland's interest rates had been raised to 15.5% to deal with the high inflation.
On the night of Wednesday, 8 October 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland abandoned its attempt to peg the Icelandic króna at 131 krónur to the euro after trying to set this peg on 6 October. By 9 October, the Icelandic króna was trading at 340 to the euro when trading in the currency collapsed due to the FME's takeover of the last major Icelandic bank, and thus the loss of all króna trade 'clearing houses'. The next day, the central bank introduced restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency within Iceland. From 9 October to 5 November, the European Central Bank quoted a reference rate of 305 krónur to the euro.
The Central Bank of Iceland set up a temporary system of daily currency auctions on 15 October to facilitate international trade. The value of the króna is determined by supply and demand in these auctions. The first auction sold €25 million at a rate of 150 krónur to the euro. Commercial króna trading outside Iceland restarted on 28 October, at an exchange rate of 240 krónur to the euro, after Icelandic interest rates had been raised to 18%. The foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland fell by US$289 million during October 2008.
During November, the real exchange rate (discounting inflation) of the Icelandic króna, as quoted by the Central Bank of Iceland, was roughly one-third lower than the average rate from 1980–2008, and 20% lower than the historical lows during the same period. The external rate as quoted by the European Central Bank was lower still. On the last trading day of the month, 28 November, the Central Bank of Iceland was quoting 182.5 krónur to the euro, while the European Central Bank was quoting 280 krónur to the euro.
On 28 November, the Central Bank of Iceland and the Minister for Business Affairs agreed a new set of currency regulations, replacing the central bank's restrictions imposed early on in the crisis. Movements of capital to and from Iceland were banned without a license from central bank. It is estimated that foreign investors hold some €2.9 billion in króna-denominated securities, popularly known as "glacier bonds".
The foreign exchange rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore foreign exchange market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside the control of any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 to make up the difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.
The last currency auction was held on 3 December. The domestic interbank foreign exchange market reopened the following day with three market makers, all of them government-owned. On the first two days of domestic trading, the króna climbed to 153.3 to the euro, up 22% against the last currency auction rate.
In January 2009, the exchange rate of Icelandic króna against Euro seemed to be more stabilized compared with the situation in October 2008, with the lowest rate at 177.5 krónur per EUR on 1, 3 and 4 January 2009, and the highest at 146.8 on 30 January 2009. In the meantime, however, Iceland's 12-month inflation in January 2009 climbed to a record high of 18.6%.
Banks.
In September 2008, internal documents from Kaupthing, the largest bank in Iceland, were leaked to WikiLeaks. On 29 September 2008, a plan was announced for the bank Glitnir to be nationalised by the Icelandic government with the purchase of a 75% stake for €600 million. The government stated that it did not intend to hold ownership of the bank for a long period, and that the bank was expected to carry on operating as normal. According to the government, the bank "would have ceased to exist" within a few weeks if there had not been intervention. It later turned out that Glitnir had US$750 million of debt due to mature on 15 October. However, the nationalization of Glitnir never went through, as it was placed in receivership by the FME before the initial plan of the Icelandic government to purchase a 75% stake had been approved by shareholders.
The announced nationalisation of Glitnir came just as the United Kingdom government was forced to nationalise Bradford & Bingley and to sell its retail operations and branch network to Grupo Santander. Over the weekend of 4–5 October, British newspapers carried many articles detailing the nationalisation of Glitnir and the high leverage of Iceland's other banks. Influential BBC business editor Robert Peston published an opinion piece on the banks, stating that debt insurance for Kaupthing required a premium of £625,000 to guarantee the return of £1 million: "the worst case of financial BO I've encountered in some time" was his graphic description. "The Guardian" said "Iceland is on the brink of collapse. Inflation and interest rates are raging upwards. The krona, Iceland's currency, is in freefall." These articles spooked investors discussing Icesave (the brand name of Landsbanki in the UK and the Netherlands) in online forums and many started moving their savings out of the Internet bank. Problems with access to the site hinted at a run on savings.
On 6 October, a number of private interbank credit facilities to Icelandic banks were shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation, and announced a package of new regulatory measures which were to be put to the Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, with the cooperation of the opposition parties. These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full. The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier.
That evening, the Guernsey subsidiary of Landsbanki went into voluntary administration with the approval of the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. The administrators would later say that "The main reason for the Bank’s difficulties has been the placing of funds with its UK fellow subsidiary, Heritable Bank." Guernsey's Chief Minister stated "the directors of Landsbanki Guernsey took appropriate steps by putting the bank into administration."
The FME placed Landsbanki in receivership early on 7 October. A press release from the FME stated that all of Landsbanki's domestic branches, call centres, ATMs and internet operations will be open for business as usual, and that all "domestic deposits" were fully guaranteed. The UK government used the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 first to transfer retail deposits from Heritable Bank to a Treasury holding company, then to sell them to Dutch bank ING Direct for £1 million. The same day, the FME placed also Glitnir into receivership.
That afternoon, there was a telephone conversation between Icelandic Finance Minister Árni Mathiesen and UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling. That evening, one of the governors of the Central Bank of Iceland, Davíð Oddsson, was interviewed on Icelandic public service broadcaster RÚV and stated that "we Icelandic State do not intend to pay the debts of the banks that have been a little heedless". He compared the government's measures to the U.S. intervention at Washington Mutual, and suggested that foreign creditors would "unfortunately only get 5–10–15% of their claims".
Darling announced that he was taking steps to freeze the assets of Landsbanki in the UK. The Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008 was passed at 10 am on 8 October 2008 and came into force ten minutes later. Under the order the UK Treasury froze the assets of Landsbanki within the UK, and introduced provisions to prevent the sale or movement of Landsbanki assets within the UK, even if held by the Central Bank of Iceland or the Government of Iceland. The freezing order took advantage of provisions in sections 4 and 14 and Schedule 3 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, and was made "because the Treasury believed that action to the detriment of the UK's economy (or part of it) had been or was likely to be taken by certain persons who are the government of or resident of a country or territory outside the UK."
The UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, announced that the UK government would launch legal action against Iceland over concerns with compensation for the estimated 300,000 UK savers. Geir Haarde said at a press conference on the following day that the Icelandic government was outraged that the UK government applied provisions of anti-terrorism legislation to it in a move they dubbed an "unfriendly act". The Chancellor of the Exchequer also said that the UK government would foot the entire bill to compensate UK retail depositors, estimated at £4 billion. It is reported that more than £4 billion in Icelandic assets in the UK have been frozen by the UK government. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) also declared Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander, the UK subsidiary of Kaupthing Bank, in default on its obligations, sold Kaupthing Edge, its Internet bank, to ING Direct, and put Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander into administration. Over £2.5 billion of deposits for 160,000 customers were sold to ING Direct. The scale of the run on Kaupthing Edge deposits had been such that many transactions were not completed until 17 October. Although Geir Haarde has described the UK government's actions over Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander as an "abuse of power" and "unprecedented", they were the third such actions taken under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 in less than ten days, after interventions in Bradford & Bingley and Heritable Bank.
On the same day, the Sveriges Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, made a credit facility of 5 billion Swedish krona (€520 million) available to Kaupthing Bank Sverige AB, the Swedish subsidiary of Kaupthing. The loan was to pay "depositors and other creditors".
On 9 October, Kaupthing was placed into receivership by the FME, following the resignation of the entire board of directors. The bank said that it was in technical default on its loan agreements after its UK subsidiary had been placed into administration. Kaupthing's Luxembourg subsidiary asked for, and obtained, a suspension of payments (similar to chapter 11 protection) in the Luxembourg District Court. Kaupthing's Geneva office, which was a branch of its Luxembourg subsidiary, was prevented from making any payments of more than 5000 Swiss francs by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. The directors of Kaupthing's subsidiary on the Isle of Man decided to wind up the company after consultation with the Manx authorities. The Finnish Financial Supervision Authority, "Rahoitustarkastus", announced having taken control of Kaupthing's Helsinki branch already on 6th, to prevent money from being sent back to Iceland.
On the same day, the UK Treasury issued a licence under the Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008 to allow the London branch of Landsbanki to continue some business. A second licence was issued on 13 October, when the Bank of England provided a £100 million secured loan to Landsbanki "to help maximise the returns to UK creditors."
On 12 October the Norwegian government took control of Kaupthing's Norwegian operations, including "all of the bank's assets and liabilities in Norway."
On 21 October, the Central Bank of Iceland asked the remaining independent financial institutions for new collateral against their loans. This was to replace the shares in Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing which had been pledged as collateral previously and which were now of much lower value, if not worthless. The value of the collateral was estimated at 300 billion krónur (€2 billion). One of the banks, Sparisjóðabanki (SPB, also known as Icebank), stated the next day that it could not provide new collateral for its 68 billion krónur (€451 million) loan, and would have to turn to the government for help. "This problem won’t be solved in any other way," said CEO Agnar Hansson.
On 24 October, it emerged that a Norwegian export credit company (Eksportfinans) had made a complaint to Norwegian police concerning the alleged embezzlement of 415 million Norwegian kroner (€47 million) by Glitnir since 2006. The Icelandic bank had acted as an agent for Eksportfinans, administering loans to several companies: however Eksportfinans alleges that, when the loans were paid off early by borrowers, Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans, effectively taking an unauthorized loan itself.
Stock market.
Trading in shares of six financial companies on the OMX Nordic Iceland Exchange was suspended on 6 October by order of the FME. On Thursday 9 October, all trading on the exchange was frozen for two days by the government "in an attempt to prevent further panic spreading throughout the country's financial markets". The decision was made to do so due to "unusual market conditions", with share prices having fallen 30% since the start of the month. The closure was extended through Monday 13 October due to continuing "unusual market conditions".
The market reopened on 14 October with the main index, the OMX Iceland 15, at 678.4, which corresponds to a plunge of about 77% compared with 3,004.6 before the closure. This reflects the fact that the value of the three big banks, which form 73.2% of the value of the OMX Iceland 15, had been set to zero. The values of other equities varied from +8% to −15%. Trading in shares of Exista, SPRON and Straumur-Burðarás (13.66% of the OMX Iceland 15) remains suspended. After a week of very thin trading, the OMX Iceland 15 closed on 17 October at 643.1, down 93% in króna terms and 96% in euro terms from its historic high of 9016 (18 July 2007).
Trading in the shares of two financial services companies, Straumur–Burðarás and Exista, resumed on 9 December: together the companies account for 12.04% of the OMX Iceland 15. The values of the shares in both companies dropped sharply, and the index closed at 394.88, down by 40.17% on the day. Trading in shares in SPRON and Kaupthing remains suspended, at prices of 1.90 krónur and 694.00 krónur respectively.
Sovereign debt.
The four credit rating agencies which monitor Iceland's sovereign debt all lowered their ratings during the crisis, and their outlook for future ratings changes became negative. The Icelandic government had a relatively healthy balance, with sovereign debt of 28% of GDP and a budget surplus of 6% of GDP (2007). More recently, the estimated 2011 debt was 130% of GDP with a budget deficit of 6% of GDP.
In addition, the value of foreign currency bonds which matured in the remainder of 2008 was only $600 million, and foreign currency debt service in 2009 was only $215 million, well within the government's ability to pay. However the agencies believed that the government would have to issue more foreign currency bonds, both to cover losses as the banks' overseas operations are liquidated and also to stimulate demand in the domestic economy as Iceland goes into recession.
A team of experts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrived in Iceland at the start of October 2008 for talks with the government. Industry Minister Össur Skarphéðinsson was said to be "favourable" to help from the IMF to stabilise the króna and to allow interest rates to be lowered.
On 7 October, the central bank of Iceland announced that they had been in talks with the Russian ambassador to Iceland, Victor I. Tatarintsev, over a €4 billion loan from Russia. The loan would be given across three or four years, with an interest rate 30 to 50 points above LIBOR. Central Bank of Iceland governor Davíð Oddsson later clarified that the loan was still being negotiated. According to RÚV, prime minister Geir Haarde had been investigating the possibility of a Russian loan since the mid-summer. When questioned on the matter in a press conference, Geir Haarde said: "We have not received the kind of support that we were requesting from our friends. So in a situation like that one has to look for new friends."
A team of Icelandic negotiators arrived in Moscow on 14 October to discuss the possible loan. Russian deputy finance minister Dmitri Pankin said that "The meeting took place in a friendly atmosphere... We are working thoroughly on the issue to take a final decision". On the same day, the Central Bank of Iceland drew on its swap facilities with the central banks of Denmark and Norway for €200 million each. Iceland has swap facilities with the other Nordic countries for a total of €1.5 billion. Iceland is also seeking assistance from the European Central Bank (ECB): there is some precedent for the move, as the ECB already has currency swap arrangements with Switzerland, another non-member of the European Union.
On 24 October, the IMF tentatively agreed to lend €1.58 billion.</ref> However the loan had still not been approved by the Executive Board of the IMF on 13 November. Due to the delay Iceland found itself caught in a classic catch-22 situation, loans from other countries could not be secured until the IMF program had been approved. The Icelandic government spoke of a $500M (€376M) gap in the funding plans. Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos stated that the Netherlands would oppose the loan unless agreement was reached over deposit insurance for Landsbanki customers in the Netherlands.
The IMF-led package of $4.6bn was finally agreed on 19 November, with the IMF loaning $2.1bn and another $2.5bn of loans and currency swaps from Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. In addition, Poland has offered to lend $200M and the Faroe Islands have offered $50M, about 3% of Faroese GDP. The Icelandic government reported that Russia offered to lend $500M, and Poland, $200M. The next day, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom announced a joint loan of $6.3bn (€5bn), related to the deposit insurance dispute.
Causes.
In 2001, banks were deregulated in Iceland. This set the stage for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by "The Economist" in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.
Coming from a small domestic market, Iceland's banks have financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form of external debt). Households also took on a large amount of debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.
In response to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.
As with many banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it increasingly difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally have to ask for a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.
The situation was made worse by the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity, and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.
The existence of a bank run on Landsbanki accounts in the UK in the period up to 7 October seems confirmed by a statement from the bank on 10 October, which said "Landsbanki Íslands hf. transferred substantial funds to its UK branch during this time to fulfil its Icesave commitments." The transfer of funds from Landsbanki Guernsey to Heritable Bank, a Landsbanki subsidiary in the UK, also suggests a bank run in the UK. A transfer of "substantial funds" from Iceland to the UK would have been a significant downward push on the value of the króna, even before the effects of any speculation.
Bank restructuring.
The Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) has acted to "ring-fence" the Icelandic operations of Landsbanki and Glitnir, stating its aim of "continued banking operations for Icelandic families and businesses." NBI (originally known as "Nýi Landsbanki") was set up on 9 October with 200 billion krónur in equity and 2,300 billion krónur of assets. Nýi Glitnir was set up on 15 October with 110 billion krónur in equity and 1,200 billion krónur of assets.
Talks with Icelandic pension funds to sell Kaupthing as a going concern broke down on 17 October, and Nýja Kaupþing was set up on 22 October with 75 billion krónur in equity and 700 billion krónur of assets.
The equity in all three new banks was supplied by the Icelandic government, and amounted to 30% of Iceland's GDP. The new banks will also have to reimburse their predecessors for the net value of the transferred assets, as determined by "recognised appraisers". As of 14 November 2008, these net values were estimated as: NBI ISK558.1bn (€3.87bn), Nýi Glitnir ISK442.4bn (€2.95bn); Nýja Kaupþing ISK172.3bn (€1.14bn). The total debt of 1173 billion krónur is more than 90% of Iceland's 2007 gross domestic product.
Glitnir and Kaupthing, shorn of their Icelandic operations, obtained moratoria on payments to creditors (similar to Chapter 11 protection) from the District Court of Reykjavík on 24 November.
In April 2009, Gylfi Magnússon, Iceland’s business minister, stated that there are similarities with the country’s banking system and failed US energy company Enron.
Effects.
Within Iceland.
The current economic climate in the country has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki, the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar job losses are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The job losses can be compared with the 2,136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008.
Other companies have also been affected. For example, the private Sterling Airlines declared bankruptcy on 29 October 2008. The national airline Icelandair has noticed a significant slump in domestic demand for flights. However, the airline states that year-on-year international demand is up from last year. Guðjón Arngrímsson, a spokesman for the airline, said "we're getting decent traffic from other markets... we are trying to let the weak [króna] help us." He has also stated that it is impossible to predict whether the company will be profitable this year. "Morgunblaðið", an Icelandic newspaper, is cutting some jobs and merging parts of its operations with the media corporation 365. The newspaper "24 stundir" has ceased publication due to the crisis, resulting in the loss of 20 jobs.
Importers are particularly hard hit, with the government restricting foreign currency to essential products such as food, medicines and oil. The €400 million loan from the central banks of Denmark and Norway is sufficient to pay for a month's imports, although on 15 October there was still a "temporary delay" which affected "all payments to and from the country".
The assets of Icelandic pension funds are, according to one expert, expected to shrink by 15–25%. The Icelandic Pension Funds Association has announced that benefits will in all likelihood have to be cut in 2009. Iceland's GDP is expected by economists to shrink by as much as 10% as a result of the crisis, putting Iceland by some measures in an economic depression. Inflation may climb as high as 75% by the end of the year.
Unemployment had more than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 registered jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 at the end of August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% denominated in foreign currencies, debt payment is going to be more costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According to the president of the Icelandic Federation of Labour (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.
On 17 July 2009, lawmakers voted 33–28 (with two abstentions) to approve a government plan for Iceland to apply for full European Union membership. Although Iceland already had a free trade arrangement with the EU, it had always rejected full membership due to concerns that its independence could be compromised. However, Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, who was elected in April, had promised to bring Iceland into the EU to help stabilize its economy. EU enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed support for Iceland's membership, stating that as "a country with deep democratic traditions", Iceland will be welcome in the EU's expansion plans.
Outside Iceland.
Over £840 million in cash from more than 100 UK local authorities was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council are meeting to try to persuade the Treasury to secure the money in the same way that customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.
In an emergency sitting of Tynwald on 9 October, the Isle of Man government raised compensation from 75% of the first £15,000 per depositor to 100% of £50,000 per depositor. The Chief Minister of the Isle of Man, Tony Brown, confirmed that Kaupthing had guaranteed the operations and liabilities of its Manx subsidiary in September 2007, and that the Manx government was pressing Iceland to honour this guarantee. Depositors with Landsbanki on Guernsey found themselves without any depositor protection.
On 11 October, an agreement was reached between the Icelandic and Dutch governments on the savings of about 120,000 Dutch citizens. The Icelandic government will cover the first €20,887 on savings accounts of Dutch citizens held by Landsbanki subsidiary Icesave, using money lent by the Dutch government. The total value of Icesave deposits in the Netherlands is €1.7 billion. At the same time, Iceland and Britain reached an agreement on the general contours of a solution: Icesave deposits in the UK total £4 billion (€5 billion) in 300,000 accounts. The figure of €20,887 is the amount covered by the Icelandic Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund (DIGF; "Tryggingarsjóður" in Icelandic): however, the DIGF had equity of only 8.3 billion krónur at the end of 2007, €90 million at the exchange rates of the time and far from sufficient to cover the Dutch and British claims.
The cost of deposit insurance in the UK is not completely clear as of November 2008. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) paid around £3 billion to transfer deposits from Heritable Bank and Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander to ING Direct, while the UK Treasury paid an additional £600 million to guarantee retail deposits that were higher than the FSCS limit. The Treasury also paid out £800 million to guarantee Icesave deposits that were higher than the limit. A loan of £2.2 billion to the Icelandic government is expected to cover the claims against the Icelandic DIGF relating to Icesave, while the exposure of the UK FSCS is expected to be £1–2 billion.
The crisis also prompted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reduce its foreign aid to developing nations, from 0.31% to 0.27% of GNP. The effect of the aid cut was greatly amplified by the falling value of the króna: the budget of Icelandic International Development Agency (ICEIDA) was reduced from US$22 million to $13 million. Since Iceland's foreign aid is targeted in sectors for which the country has particular expertise (e.g., fisheries, geothermal power), the cutbacks will have a substantial impact in countries which receive Icelandic aid – most noticeably in Sri Lanka, where ICEIDA is pulling out altogether.
On 27 February 2009, the "Wall Street Journal" reported that Iceland's new government was trying to raise $25 million by selling its ambassadorial residences in Washington, New York, London and Oslo.
On 28 August 2009, Iceland's parliament voted 34–15 (with 14 abstentions) to approve a bill (commonly referred to as the "Icesave bill") to pay the United Kingdom and the Netherlands more than $5 billion lost in Icelandic deposit accounts. Initially opposed in June, the bill was passed after amendments were added which set a ceiling on the payment based on the country's gross domestic product. Opponents of the bill argued that Icelanders, already reeling from the crisis, should not have to pay for mistakes made by private banks under the watch of other governments. However, the government argued that if the bill failed to pass, the UK and the Netherlands might retaliate by blocking a planned aid package for Iceland from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under the deal, up to 4% of Iceland's gross domestic product (GDP) will be paid to the UK, in sterling terms, from 2017–2023 while the Netherlands will receive up to 2% of Iceland's GDP, in euro terms, for the same period. Talks between Icelandic, Dutch and UK ministers in January 2010 dubbed as "Icesave" did not result in any specific actions being agreed upon.
Criminal investigation.
The Office of the Special Prosecutor was founded with the passage of a bill in the Icelandic parliament 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or in the wake of the banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.
In April 2009, Iceland's state prosecutor hired Eva Joly, the Norwegian-French investigator who led Europe’s biggest ever fraud investigations into bribery and corruption at oil group Elf Aquitaine, as special consultant to a 20-member ”economic crime team” to “investigate suspicions of criminal actions in the period preceding the collapse of the Icelandic banks” which may involve several Iceland's business and banking leaders. Joly stated that the investigation will require a minimum of 2–3 years to build up enough evidence to secure prosecutions.
In an interview Joly stated that:
“Finding proof will start at home in Iceland, but my instinct is that it will spread. If there are things relevant to the UK we will get in touch with the Serious Fraud Office. If there are things relevant to Germany we will get in touch with their authorities. In Iceland, there is more than enough for a starting point for the investigation, given all the talk about market manipulation and unusual loans. If these are proved they are embezzlement and fraud. The priority is tracing any flow of assets from the banks and getting them back.”
The investigation is expected to focus on a number of questionable financial practices engaged in by Icelandic banks:
Related arrests.
On 9 March 2011, Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz were arrested in London by the UK's Serious Fraud Office as part of their ongoing investigation in conjunction with Iceland's Special Prosecutor’s Office into the collapse of Icelandic Bank Kaupthing.
Scrutiny of Icelandic business leaders.
Since the crisis began, many of Iceland's business leaders, who had previously been considered financial gurus who greatly developed Iceland's economy, are now under intense public scrutiny for their roles in causing the financial crisis:
Reportedly, all of those under scrutiny are now rarely seen in public and some have apparently left the country. They are also reportedly the subjects of an ongoing investigation to determine if any of their business practices warrant criminal prosecution.
Statements from former politicians.
Former Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson has claimed that Iceland needs to investigate “unusual and unconventional loans” given by the banks to senior politicians during the years before the crisis.
Björn Bjarnson, the former Minister for Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs, has started a blog detailing the problems with the business sector and the efforts to cover them up. This was cited as an example of how politicians and businessmen, who traditionally held a tight grip over the Icelandic media, have lost this control and that dozens of similar blogs have been created. Björn stated that:
“I have written a lot about problems in the business sector over the last 14 years, and I can only compare some parts of it to Enron. Here companies have been playing a game, using the media and publishing to make themselves look good. We only hope that the foreign media will soon begin to understand what has been going on.”
Political aftermath.
Parts of the Icelandic public have arranged protests against the Central Bank, the Parliament and the government's alleged lack of responsibility before and after the crisis, attracting between 3000 and 6000 people (1–2% of Iceland's population) on Saturdays.
In early November, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an informal lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) as well as the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.
In October 2008, the UK PM Gordon Brown used provisions in part 2 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to freeze Landsbanki holdings in the United Kingdom. Iceland's prime minister Geir Haarde protested against what he described as "a terrorist law being applied against us", calling it "a completely unfriendly act". Angered by the British decision, Iceland decided to submit a formal complaint to NATO about their move, and it also provoked more than 80,000 Icelandics (equal to 25% of its entire population) to sign an online petition set up under the heading "Icelanders are not terrorists". The relationship got further tense, when UK a month later replied by cancelling its scheduled patrol of the Icelandic airspace in December 2008. Iceland has no standing army of its own, and relies on a long-term standing agreement with NATO where a group of member states have committed in turns to defend the Icelandic airspace, and the UK Royal Air Force had now cancelled this after mutual agreement with NATO (presumably with another member state having accepted to overtake the liability).
According to a poll from late November 2008, 64% were in favour of early elections, with only 29.3% opposed. In a poll from 22 November 2008, the Social Democratic Alliance led with 33.6%, followed by the Left-Green Alliance at 27.8% and the Independence Party at 24.8%; the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party were far behind, with only 6.3% and 4.3%, respectively.
As the Parliament met again on 20 January 2009, there were protests with reinvigorated force and escalation of conflict between protesters and the police. On 22 January, police used tear gas to disperse people on Austurvöllur (the square in front of the Alþing), the first such use since the 1949 anti-NATO protest.
Government resignation.
Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde announced on 23 January 2009 that he would be stepping down as leader of the Independence Party for health reasons: he has been diagnosed as having a malignant oesophageal tumour. He said he would travel to the Netherlands around the end of January for treatment. Education Minister and Independence Party Vice-Chairman Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir was to serve as Prime Minister in his absence. The leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, Foreign Minister Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, was also unwell, undergoing treatment for a benign brain tumour since September 2008. The government recommended that elections be held on 9 May 2009.
Björgvin G. Sigurðsson, Iceland's Commerce Minister, resigned on 25 January, citing the pressures of the nation's economic collapse, as the country's political leaders failed to agree on how to lead country out of its financial crisis. One of his last acts as minister was to dismiss the director of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA). Björgvin acknowledged that Icelanders have lost faith in their government and political system. "I want to shoulder my part of the responsibility for that," he said.
Negotiations on continuing the coalition broke down the next day, apparently over demands from the Social Democratic Alliance to take over the leadership of the government, and Geir Haarde tendered the government's resignation to the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. The President asked the present government to continue until a new government can be formed, and held talks with the five political parties represented in the Althing.
After these discussions, Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir of the Social Democratic Alliance and Steingrímur J. Sigfússon of the Left-Green Movement were asked by the President to negotiate the formation of a new coalition government. Such a coalition would be five seats short of an overall majority in the Althing, but the Progressive Party (seven seats) was expected to support the coalition without actually joining the government. Neither party leader became Prime Minister: instead, the position went to Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir of the Social Democratic Alliance, then the Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security, who became the new chairwoman of her party on 28 March 2009.
On 8 April 2009, former Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde stated that he was solely responsible for accepting controversial donations to the Icelandic Independence Party in 2006, ISK 30 million from the investment group FL Group, and ISK 25 million from Landsbanki.
Geir was strongly criticized in the April 2010 report of the Special Investigative Commission into the financial collapse, being accused of "negligence" along with three other ministers of his government. Iceland's parliament voted 33–30 to indict Geir, but not the other ministers, on charges of negligence in office at a session on 28 September 2010. He will stand trial before the "Landsdómur", a special court to hear cases alleging misconduct in government office: it will be the first time the "Landsdómur" has convened since it was established in the 1905 Constitution. The trial began in Reykjavik on 5 March 2012. Geir Haarde was found guilty on one of four charges on 23 April 2012, for not holding cabinet meetings on important state matters. Landsdómur said Mr. Haarde would face no punishment, as this was a minor offence.
Crisis resolution.
Recovery starting in 2011.
Iceland's financial position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment appear to have been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.
A second important factor is the success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.
Finally, the third major factor behind the resolution of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign of the success of the above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.
Iceland has undertaken recapitalization of lenders such as injection of ISK 33 billion (2.1% of 2010 GDP) into Housing Financing Fund at the end of 2010, under a restructuing plan approved by the EFTSA.
Aftermath (2012–2013).
By mid-2012 Iceland was regarded as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.
Iceland elected a new government in April 2013, which as one of their top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors - which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government - making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government’s goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013.

HotJava Views was a productivity software suite developed by Sun Microsystems and implemented in Java. It was released in 1996 and was intended primarily for JavaStation or other JavaOS-based network computers.
HotJava Views consisted of four applications:
The graphical user interface of HotJava Views was quite novel in that it dispensed with some of the common features of GUIs in order to simplify the interface. Menu bars and overlapping, resizable windows were eliminated and a simple "Selector" icon bar was used to switch between applications.

Tiny Troubles

Tiny Troubles is a 1939 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by George Sidney. It was the 176th "Our Gang" short (177th episode, 88th talking short, 89th talking episode, and 8th MGM produced episode) that was released.
Plot.
Alfalfa has a loud crying baby brother that he wants to get rid of. When out with the gang he sees what he thinks is a baby in a carriage. He puts his baby brother in that carriage and takes this "baby" back home. But the baby happens to be a midget who lives a life of crime named "Lightfingered Lester". Lester initially plays along but causes all sorts of havoc soon after including drinking beer, taunting the gang, and attempting to rob the house. Someone else finds the baby and brings him to the police station. The police then raid Alfalfa's home and take the gang in when they find Lester there. They are all taken in. They send Lester back to jail while giving the gang probation.
Notes.
The MGM Our Gang series began its slow but steady decline with this film that many considered sub-standard. The notion that the kids would mistake the obviously mature Lester for a tiny baby is as hard to swallow as the rest of the story. Leonard Maltin stated on the "Little Rascals: Life & Times Of Our Gang" that this film was the first of the really bad MGM Our Gang episodes and just a preview of what was to come. He even stated that this film was worse than even the worst of the 81 Hal Roach episodes and any of the 7 MGM episodes that preceded this. The series only goes downhill from here.

Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Veliko Tarnovo

The Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki (, "tsarkva "Sv. Dimitar Solunski"") is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church in the city of Veliko Tarnovo in central northern Bulgaria, the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire.
The church lies at the northeastern foot of the Trapezitsa and Tsarevets hills, on the right bank of the Yantra River, outside the city's medieval fortifications. Architecturally, it has a pentahedral apse and a cross-domed design with a narthex and a fore-apse space. It was once part of a large monastery and belonged in its southeastern part. The church's exterior is decorated with blind arches and colourful ornaments: glazed rosettes, suns, rhombs and other painted figures. The church was built of stone alternated with three rows of bricks. It is in size.
According to the account of Niketas Choniates, the church was the place where the anti-Byzantine Uprising of Asen and Peter was proclaimed in 1185; it was this uprising that led to the reestablishment of the Bulgarian Empire and the proclamation of Tarnovo for its capital. It is theorized that it was a royal church in the early years of the empire and it received donations from members of the Asen dynasty. According to the legend, the nobles ("bolyari") Asen and Peter announced that the patron of Thessaloniki, the warrior saint Demetrius, would desert his city and come to Tarnovo to aid the Bulgarian rebels. The brothers built and inaugurated a church in his honour.
The Church of St Demetrius was destroyed in the second half of the 13th century, probably due to an earthquake, but was reconstructed in the 1350s. A single-apse church was built nearby in the 1360s and existed until the 17th century; it used materials from the destroyed Church of St Demetrius. The monastery yard and the destroyed buildings became a predominantly Christian necropolis during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. During the Bulgarian National Revival, the church was associated with the leatherworkers' guild.
In the late 18th and early 19th century, the Church of St Demetrius was plundered by robbers. In the second half of the 19th century it was in a very bad condition, which was noted by Bulgarian and foreign researchers, including Felix Philipp Kanitz. An earthquake in 1913 destroyed it completely, leaving only the apse and fragments of the original frescoes.
The Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki was reconstructed beginning in 1977–1985 based on the available architectural remains and the example of better preserved Bulgarian churches from the same period. The project was headed by Teofil Teofilov. Of the original church, two layers of frescoes have been preserved: an early one dating either to the church's construction or to the second half of the 14th century and a later one painted after the 14th century.

Amrita Club

The Amrita Club building is located at the southeast corner of Church (US 44/NY 55) and Market streets in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. It was once home to the club, one of the city's most prestigious gentlemen's organizations. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The club was established in the late 19th century, but the building was not erected until the early 20th. It is one of only two brick Colonial Revival buildings in the city, and a sophisticated application of that style. Efforts to redevelop it in the early 21st century led to a protracted legal threats and negotiated settlement between the city and the local software company which currently utilize the building as it's corporate headquarter and development laboratory.
Building.
The Amrita Club is in a very historic neighborhood. It is across the street from the Market Street Row, a group of houses that includes Poughkeepsie's oldest frame house, and immediately north of the Hasbrouck House, with the Adriance Memorial Library a few houses down. It is across Church from the armory and across on the opposite corner is the Old Poughkeepsie YMCA. All of these are also listed on the Register.
The building itself is a rectangular structure three stories tall, with raised basement, and eight to nine bays wide by three deep. Its double-doored, centrally-located entrance has a marble surround consisting of columns with sculpted capitals and a dentilled entablature. Below that, the doors themselves are topped with a stained glass transom. The whole doorway is further topped with a keystone decorated with fleur-de-lis and ribbons on either side.
On either flank of the entrance, the first floor features French windows and iron balconies, except for the smaller windows next to the door, trimmed with marble lintels and sills. A similar pattern is found on the larger windows of the third story. Above them is a dentilled cornice and architrave; two large chimneys rise from the hipped roof. The rear elevation features two porches with Doric columns.
History.
The club was founded in 1873 for local businessmen and professionals, with future neighbor and prominent local lawyer Frank Hasbrouck as one of the charter members. It excluded Catholics, African-Americans and Jews, and soon became synonymous with the city's elite. In 1905, local historian Edmund Platt described as "the first club of any importance". "Much of Poughkeepsie's growth was decided at the Amrita Club's dinner table", writes Carolyn Burke in her biography of Lee Miller, whose father was a member during her childhood.
It met either in rented rooms or refurbished older buildings until it decided to build its own clubhouse in 1912. It cost the club $100,000 ($ in 2008 dollars.)
Over the course of the 20th century, the club's influence waned as the city grew more diverse and its industrial base declined. In the 1980s it eventually disbanded and the building became city property. Unoccupied, it decayed until 1999 when Decision Technologies International (DTI), a software consulting firm based in nearby Wappinger, reached a deal with the city to renovate the building and use it as its headquarters. The city committed $800,000 in urban-redevelopment grants to help the company.
In 2002, almost a year and a half after DTI had last withdrawn funds from the account, the city moved to foreclose on the property since it believed DTI was not serious about redeveloping it and it had been approached by others who were. DTI insisted it was serious, and after first threatening to contest any action vigorously, agreed to waive certain defenses in exchange for a 30-day reprieve. The city formally commenced foreclosure actions early in 2003, with DTI's founder, Idoni Matthews, promising a court fight. In October it began work again. DTI completed the renovation works in 2004, the city granted DTI a Certificate of Occupancy. The building currently home of DTI's corporate headquarter and software development laboratory.

Isaacus Rothovius (1572–1652) was the bishop of Turku from 1627–1652. He was born in Sweden, and did not speak Finnish when he arrived in Turku. He also considered the Finns ( especially during the early years of his term) to be barbaric. Bishop Rothovius forced the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church and its priests to change several of their customs, such as reading different Bible passages from different sides of the church, and wearing colourful garments, which reminded him of Finland's Roman Catholic past. Bishop Rothovius's most notable achievements were his help in speeding up the translation of the entire Bible into Finnish (completed in 1642), and in changing the Turku Cathedral School into the Gymnasium of Turku (an upper secondary school) in 1630, and in supporting the establishment of the Academy of Turku (now the University of Turku) in 1640.

Diderot effect

The Diderot effect is a social phenomenon related to consumer goods which either posits that form culturally defines groups that are considered cohesive or refers to a process of spiralling consumption resulting from dissatisfaction induced by a new possession. The term was coined by anthropologist and scholar of consumption patterns Grant McCracken in 1988, and is named after the French philosopher Denis Diderot (1713–84) who first described the effect in an essay.
The term has subsequently come to be used, especially in discussions of sustainable consumption or green consumerism to refer to the process whereby a purchase or gift creates dissatisfaction with existing possessions and environment, provoking a potentially spiralling pattern of consumption with negative environmental, psychological and social impacts. 
The effect was first described in Diderot's essay "Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown". Here he tells how the gift of a beautiful scarlet dressing gown leads to unexpected results, eventually plunging him into debt. Initially pleased with the gift, Diderot came to rue his new garment. Compared to his elegant new dressing gown, the rest of his possessions began to seem tawdry and he became dissatisfied that they did not live up to the elegance and style of his new possession. He replaced his old straw chair, for example, with an armchair covered in Moroccan leather; his old desk was replaced with an expensive new writing table; his formerly beloved prints were replaced with more costly prints, and so on. “I was absolute master of my old dressing gown,” Diderot writes, “but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain.”
In McCracken's usage the Diderot Effect is the result of the interaction between objects within "product complements", or "Diderot unities", and consumers. A Diderot unity is a group of objects that are considered to be culturally complementary in relation to one another. For example, items of clothing, furniture, vehicles, etc. McCracken describes that a consumer is less likely to veer from a preferred Diderot unity in order to strive towards unity in appearance and representation of one's social role. However, it can also mean that if an object that is somehow deviant from the preferred Diderot unity is acquired, it may have the effect of causing the consumer to start subscribing to a completely different Diderot unity.
Sociologist and economist Juliet Schor uses the term in her best selling 1992 book the 'The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need' to describe processes of competitive, status-conscious consumption driven by dissatisfaction. Schor's 2005 essay "Learning Diderot’s Lesson: Stopping the Upward Creep of Desire" describes the effect in contemporary consumer culture in the context of its negative environmental consequences.

Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad

The Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad operated between DeKalb Junction and Hermon in St. Lawrence County, New York over a four mile standard gauge railroad. The Adirondack&St. Lawrence was founded by the St. Lawrence Pyrites Company on April 19, 1906, and shortly thereafter the line was opened. Not only due to a parallel railroad of the Clifton Iron Company, traffic was low and in 1925 the line was abandoned and torn up. Still today the right-of-way can be observed near DeKalb Junction. In Hermon, the roadbed is now used by Water Street.
The timetable which took effect on September 26, 1909, included four trains Monday through Saturday and one train on Sundays. The trains usually made connections at DeKalb Junction to the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad. Sunday passenger traffic ended the following year and in 1912, one of the four trains was cancelled altogether. The February 1920 timetable provides only two trains.

Mogens Ellegaard

Mogens Ellegaard (1935-1995) of Denmark is widely regarded as the "father of the classical accordion."
Early life.
Ellegaard was the son of a cabinet maker and began studying the instrument at the age of eight. 
The free-bass accordion.
In 1952 Ellegaard competed at the Confédération Internationale des Accordéonistes Coupe Mondiale (World Cup) in the Netherlands. At this time he heard a free-bass accordion and decided he must get such an instrument. In the meantime, he studied literature at Schneekloth's College in Copenhagen and graduated with honors. After military service he was given an American Embassy Literary Award for study in the United States and supported himself in part by playing this accordion in restaurants and at popular concerts. 
Ellegaard returned to Denmark in 1958 and the Danish pianist/composer Vilfred Kjaer (1906-1969) wrote a concerto for him, which led to the creation of a very popular concerto for accordion by the composer Ole Schmidt. 
Ellegaard continued,
"Symphonic Fantasy and Allegro" was premiered by the Danish Radio Symphony with the composer conducting. Ole Schmidt made the following comment about the work, "I hated accordion until I met Mogens Ellegaard. He made me decide to write an accordion concerto for him." 
Other Danish composers also wrote for Ellegaard.:
Ellegaard has performed this contemporary music in solo recitals and chamber music concerts in Moscow, New York City, Tel Aviv, Amsterdam, Rome, Paris, Dublin, Reykjavík, Zagreb and Toronto, to name a few. He has been a soloist with London's Royal Philharmonic, the Detroit Symphony, the Toronto Symphony, Sudwestfunk Symphonie Orchester, Stockholm, Oslo and Helsinki Philharmonic orcehstras, BBC Scottish Symphony, and all of the Danish orchestras. He has appeared at international festivals usch as Warsaw Autumn, I.S.C.M., and Bergen.
Accordion professor.
In the early-1960s Ellegaard began working with Lars Holm at the Malmö Sweden Accordion Studio where he taught free-bass accordion. He wrote "Comprehensive Method for the Chromatic Free Bass System" which was published by Hohner in New York City in 1964. In 1970 he founded the accordion department at The Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. In 1977 he became a full professor.
In 1989 he was appointed head of the accordion faculty of the Hochschule fur Musik und Darstellende Kunst in Graz, Austria. He has conducted master class courses and seminars at Warsaw's Chopin Academy, Helsinki's Sibelius Academy, Trossingen Bundesakademie (Germany), and Conservatories in Holland, Spain, etc. Today his students teach at Scandinavian music academies, as well as at the Royal Academy in London, many Conservatories in Germany, Holland, and other locations.

Pythouse

Pythouse, sometimes spelt Pyt House and pronounced "pit-house", is a country house near Tisbury in Wiltshire, in the west of England.
Described as a "fine classical house", Pythouse is set in parkland with a ha-ha. With its Ionic portico, the front is very similar to and probably inspired the front of the nearby Philipps House in Dinton, which was begun a little later in 1813 and designed by Sir Jeffry Wyatville. 
The land of the existing building (likely already containing a house) was given to the Pyt family (pronounced "pit") in around 1225 by the abbess of Shaftesbury. The Pyts (alias Bennett, as homeage to the Benedictine Abbey of Shaftesbury), then lived continuously on the estate until around 1651. As they were forced to sell in order to pay fines levied against them by Parliament following the Civil war, as the Pyts(alias Bennetts) fought for the Royalists.
The house was then bought around the year 1651 by the Grove family, who were close friends of the Bennetts(/Pyts). Though after only fifty-six years in the house they sold it to the Benett family (no relation to the earlier Bennetts) in around 1707.
The current Pythouse was built about 1725 (Replacing an earlier, Elizabethan house) and was rebuilt in 1805 by John Benett (1773–1852), the then-owner and amateur architect, who "Palladianized" the house. Rear service wings were added in 1891.
The house remained in the Benett family until the mid-1950s, when death duties forced its sale. The house was then owned for forty-six years by the Country Houses Association, a charity which ran it as a retirement home.
Pythouse (together with of land) was sold again in 2004 for £7 million and is once more a residential home.

Lotus shoes

Lotus shoes () are footwear that were worn by women in China who had bound feet. The shoes are cone or sheath-shaped, intended to resemble a lotus bud. They were delicately constructed from cotton or silk, and small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. Some designs had heels or wedge-shaped soles. They were made in different styles and colors, and were typically ornately decorated, with embroidered designs of animals or flowers that could continue on the sole of the shoe. Some designs only fit over the tip of the foot, giving the illusion of a small bound foot when worn under a long skirt.
The tradition of foot binding began when a Chinese princess was born with unusually small feet and her father told people that it was fashionable to save his daughter embarrassment. The trend grew and it soon became a known trend as it meant that if you were small footed, you were very feminine and men found you more attractive. 
Though foot binding is no longer practiced, many lotus shoes survive as artifacts in museums or private collections.

Vari-Lite

VARI*LITE is the brand name of one of the first automated, variable-colour stage lighting systems to be created. Their intelligent lighting fixtures are commonly used in theatre, concerts, television, film and corporate events.
History.
Pre-history.
The origins of Vari-Lite date to the late 1960s, when college friends Jack Calmes and Rusty Brutsché played together in a Texas-based blues band. They built a sound system for their shows which was of such quality, that other acts asked to rent it from them.
In March 1970 Calmes and Brutsché, together with sound engineer Jack Maxson, incorporated Showco, with the intention of hiring sound systems to regional rock concerts. The company initially operated two sound systems and two trucks from Maxson's garage.
The company quickly grew, both in size and reputation, and added lighting equipment to its inventory in 1972.
By the end of the 1970s, with the competition growing, the company began looking for new ways to compete. In particular, Showco's lighting equipment was fast becoming outdated and the company could not afford to replace it.
Invention and after.
Showco had a very active R&D department, continuously looking for new technology. At the time, many companies within this market were trying to solve the problem of a producing reliable and robust colour change unit for lighting fixtures. Many of these took the form of wheels, semaphore-type devices or scrolls of Gel. However, coloured gel had a tendency to burn or rip if used incorrectly.
In 1980, one of the company engineers, Jim Bornhorst, while looking at alternative methods of colouring light, realised that dichroic filters display a strange side effect: when you twist them, the frequency of light on which the filter operates, shifts—causing it to apparently change colour. That might have been the extent of their advancement if not for a barbecue lunch in the fall of 1980. At that gathering, the idea of adding two extra motors to the fixture to actually make the light move was conceived. This "eureka" moment facilitated an all-out building effort for a fully automated lighting system. This idea, coupled with the recent appearance on the market of the General Electric Marc 350 projector lamp resulted in a prototype in December 1980, that had taken twelve weeks to build.
Also in 1980, Jack Calmes resigned as president of Showco and went on to found Syncrolite in 1984.
At the time, Showco were regular suppliers to the British band Genesis, who were always looking for new ideas for their stage shows. A number of Showco staff, including Rusty Brutsché and Jim Bornhorst, flew over to see the band and their manager in England, to show them the prototype—today known as the VL-Zero. The prototype was so simple it was built on a wooden baseplate and had no hanging method, so the team had to nail it to a beam in the outbuilding that was being used for the demonstration at an English countryside studio. The new luminaire made its debut on the side of a 500-year-old barn, and the prototype light had been programmed to enact two simple cues. The first reaction from the presentation came from band member Mike Rutherford: "I expected the colour change, but by Jove, I didn't know it was going to move."
It was enough to convince Genesis to immediately invest in developing this new technology. Having gone over there with the idea of getting some advance rental fees for the next Genesis tour, the band's manager, Tony Smith instead offered to invest in the new idea, and when the team headed back to the airport, they had a cheque for $1M in their pockets. On the plane home Jim Bornhorst dropped the bombshell: The twisting dichroic technology was not ready—they were going to have to design a new luminaire from scratch, in time for the band's next tour. This luminaire became known as the VL1.
Work began right away, not just on the new luminaire, but on the development of a whole lighting "system"—complete with a control console, power distribution and digital data transmission. Several patents were filed, in order to protect this brand new technology and the intellectual property associated with it—including US Patent No. 4392187, which described the basic system and covered both the twisting dichroic method of colour-changing and the alternative, wheel-based method, that would eventually be used in the VL1.
By the time the "Abacab" tour started in Barcelona, on September 25, 1981, not only were there 50 active VL1's, plus spares, but also a brand new multi-processor control desk, with software written by Brooks Taylor. The electric and electronic hardware were designed by John Covington & Tom Walsh. The console operator for this tour was a young man by the name of Tom Littrell, who had been taken on for the summer during the college break, and never looked back.
By this point a new company had been incorporated, with a name coined from a suggestion by Genesis manager Tony Smith. The company was called Vari-Lite Inc. By 1984 the product name was actively being differentiated from the company by using an asterisk (VARI*LITE). The asterisk went on to become the basis of the company logo, in its chosen corporate colour—teal.
The first band that hired the equipment after the "Abacab" tour, was Texas band ZZ Top, and slowly the business started to build. Over the next four years over 800 VL1's were built, and a number of distributor deals were made to introduce the product into the European (via Samuelsons), Australian (Jands) and Japanese markets.
After the 6th generation of VL1's were completed, in the late summer of 1984, design started on the Series 200 system. A new console, called the Artisan, was designed, as well as two new luminaires: the VL2—a direct descendant of the VL1 and the VL3—a wash luminaire using a twisting dichroic filter system to create colours, based on that first used in the VL-Zero.
The Series 200 system was launched in 1987. Over the years the range was expanded to include the VL4, a more compact and brighter version of the VL3, and two upgrades of the original VL2: the VL2B and the VL2C. A smaller backup console was also launched, called the Mini-Artisan.
In 1989 Vari-Lite sued Syncrolite, Inc. and its owner and founder, former Showco president Jack Calmes, over alleged patent infringements. Calmes countersued, claiming that his former business partners had kept the development of the Vari-Lite system from him at the time of his departure, causing him to lose money when he sold his Showco stock. The case was resolved in Vari-Lite's favour.
In 1992 the first Series 300 luminaire was launched: the VL5 wash luminaire. Although not a technical leap of the same magnitude that previous models were, it was very well received by the market, because of its low rental cost, reliability, versatility and compatibility with DMX512 lighting consoles, in addition to the Artisan. By this time, the use of DMX to control intelligent lighting fixtures was becoming widespread, despite it not having been originally intended for this purpose.
In 1994, Vari-lite set up Irideon Inc. to manufacture and market automated lighting products to the architectural lighting market. Irideon was sold by Vari-lite to Electronic Theatre Controls in 1998.
In August 1995 Vari-lite filed a patent infringement lawsuit against competitor High End Systems, seeking unspecified damages and an injunction against the manufacture of the Status Cue system, including the Cyberlight and Studio Color luminaires. The matter was eventually resolved out of court, in early 1999.
In 1997 the company floated on Nasdaq (NASDAQ:LITE), selling two million shares, in a move which allowed the company to retire almost half its debt. 47 percent of the company remained in the hands of Genesis and Vari-Lite management. The company then began to buy back the franchises it had created in previous years and create new rental offices, which it called Vari-Lite Production Services (VLPS) agencies. The main difference was that the company now offered conventional, third party lighting equipment for rental, in addition to its own products.
In 1999, Vari-lite launched a patent infringement lawsuit against Danish lighting company Martin Gruppen A/S, winning a preliminary injunction barring the import, sale and lease of the Martin MAC 500, MAC 600 and MAC 300 luminaires, along with the Case Series Controller, in the USA. The injunction was vacated in August of that year, but re-entered the following month. Martin responded by releasing updated products—the MAC 500SP and 600NT, which lay beyond the scope of Vari-Lite's patents.
At around the same time, similar, patent-related lawsuits were launched against two Italian manufacturers, Clay Paky and Coemar, along with various other companies. Vari-lite was represented in these cases by Texas lawyer, Theodore "Ted" Stevenson, III.
In 2002, The VARI*LITE luminaire manufacturing and sales division ( brand, assets and intellectual property ) were sold to the Genlyte Group. The rental division of the company retained the console division of the company and continued to develop the Virtuoso console product line. The rental division (by this point called VLPS Lighting Services) was merged with the Production Resource Group (PRG) in 2004.
Very soon after the acquisition by Genlyte, a new range of Vari-lite luminaires was announced—Series 2000—beginning with the VL2416 wash luminaire. Series 2000 luminaires could only be controlled by DMX data and official technical support for all Series 100 and Series 200 products was withdrawn at around the time of their release.
In early 2008, the Genlyte Group owning the VARI*LITE brand, was bought by Royal Philips Lighting. Under Philips' ownership of Genlyte, a brand new Vari-lite luminaire (the VLX wash) has been developed, which uses a cluster of high intensity RGBW LEDs as a light source. The luminaire was premiered in the Spring of 2009.
Since 1981, almost every major band has used Vari*Lites in their productions at some time, as well as TV, corporate events and even films. The company has won three Primetime Emmy Awards for technical achievement: in 1991, for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering, in the development of the Series 200 system; in 1994, for the development of the VL5 and in 2001 for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering for the Virtuoso console.
Historical perspective.
As with any cutting-edge technology which eventually becomes commonplace; it is often hard in later times, to imagine, convey—or sometimes even recall—the impact that such technology made upon its arrival. September 25, 2011 marks the 30th anniversary, of the first public appearance of a Vari-Lite system and—by definition—the beginning of the multi-million dollar, moving light "industry" which grew from that moment.
Vari-lites and their many imitators revolutionised the way that stage lighting systems were designed, programmed and used; "e.g." in the way that formerly innovative and original programming techniques—such as the use of Preset Focus positions (first seen on the Artisan)—have become a standard feature of most stage lighting controllers today. As a result, they have also had a wider influence on set design and the overall look of many stage productions, particularly concert tours.
Although it is true that the concept of colour-changing, moving light technology was far from new by the start of the 1980s and that other moving light systems—such as the Telescan by French company Cameleon and the Pancan in the UK—were being independently developed at around the same time; it was Vari-lite who were first to combine the relevant emerging technologies into a practical system, on a large scale; which could then be taken on a worldwide concert tour and set up in varying locations and environments, night after night, often over a period of several months. It was this achievement which ultimately led to the success of Vari-lite, pointed the way for those who followed and guaranteed the company's place as an innovator.
Control systems.
From the very start, Vari*Lite consoles were computerised, transmitting digital multiplexed signals to the luminaires.
Series 100.
Originally known simply as "The Vari-lite System", Series 100 used a patented protocol based on RS-422, which sent positional, beam and colour information, via a rack-mounted computer, to up to 32 individual Vari-lite luminaires (later known as VL1s), at up to 30 times a second. Up to three computers could be linked together under the control of a single console, giving a maximum system size of 96 luminaires.
The transmissions were unidirectional, and the error checking was quite rudimentary, checking each transmission bit 5 times and applying the majority result. As the information was retransmitted multiple times each second, the result was no noticeable errors by the luminaires. However, the refresh rate of a full 96 channel system was visibly noticeable if, the low-numbered channels were rigged close to high-numbered channels (in Vari*Lite jargon, a "channel" referred to a whole device, regardless of how many parameters it had).
In order to distribute both power and data, 6 channel "dumb" repeater boxes were used. The cables carried both data and power. In order to meet safety standards, the data cable was rated at 600 v, to allow it to be used in 3 phase power applications. The channel number (also known as an address) was set with three thumbwheel switches on each lite and a common practical joke on the part of non-Vari-lite crew, would be to renumber random "lites" (this became a common way of referring to a Vari*Lite unit on both sides of the Atlantic).
The designation "Series 100" was not applied until 1987, upon the release of the Series 200 system.
Series 200.
By contrast, the Series 200 system was designed to employ a proprietary, bidirectional protocol. Each luminaire became "intelligent"—storing its own positional, beam and colour information, and reacting to a global "memory cue" command, so every luminaire reacted simultaneously (see US Patent No.5010459). This overcame the limitations imposed by the processor power available at the time, on the maximum number of luminaires that could be controlled from one console.
The Series 200 system was introduced in 1987 and featured the VL2 and VL3 luminaires, controlled by the Artisan console, with power and data distributed to dumb repeater boxes by an ACS Rack. The repeaters gained three more outputs, making nine in total. Up to seven repeater boxes (63 luminaires) could be supplied by one ACS rack. Multiple ACS racks could be linked together, data-wise, with one acting as a master and the other as slaves.
Manchester encoding was used to improve transmission resilience and a polling system was introduced to get feedback (known as Reply Data) from each luminaire. Damaged cables and "chattering" lites could cause problems in larger systems, as they introduced noise into the reply data lines running back to the Artisan console, causing luminaires to appear offline. Although this did not normally affect the playback of cues, it could cause severe problems when trying to save and backup the system data onto the 1.44Mb, 3.5 inch floppy discs that were standard at the time.
Under Series 200, the number of controllable channels ("i.e." luminaires) was increased—at least on paper—to 1000; but in reality, the practical maximum was around 400. The reason for this discrepancy, was that if a luminaire had not been polled for (and had therefore not sent) its reply data within a certain time, it would become regarded as "offline" by the Artisan console. In a system of over 400 luminaires, the limitations of the hardware in the Artisan, meant that it was not possible for the console to poll all the luminaires within the allotted time.
The performance of the Series 200 system was greatly improved over its working life, through a rolling program of upgrades, modifications and retrofits. Central to these were the various software versions, which progressively refined the programming features available to Artisan console operators.
The VL4 wash luminaire was officially added to the Series 200 luminaire range in 1991.
Series 300.
By the end of the 1980s, the market for moving lights was firmly established—a market which had arguably been created single-handedly by Vari-lite themselves. However, the high cost of renting a Vari-lite system and the fact that they could only be programmed from an Artisan console, by a specially trained operator, were barriers to full realisation of market potential. Additionally, despite the protection afforded to Vari-lite technology through the use of patents, rival manufacturers were beginning to market competing moving lights; along with consoles which could control their functions using the DMX512 protocol. There were also general market concerns regarding the overall size and weight of moving lights in general, which limited the number of them that could be hung on a lighting rig and made them impractical for many small / medium scale productions.
The Series 300 system was developed to address these issues. Series 300 was not strictly a new protocol, but a development of Series 200 that moved most of the processing away from the luminaires and into the repeater box, thus creating the Vari-lite "Smart Repeater" (VLSR—see US Patent Nos. 5209560 and 5329431). The VLSR is able to distinguish between Vari-lite Series 200 and DMX512 data signals, and can be controlled with either—although not both simultaneously (merging). Having identified the type of incoming control signal, the VLSR converts it into Series 300 data; which it sends to the luminaires, along with the 24V power lines required to drive the motors. Up to six Series 300 luminaires can be controlled via one VLSR, using Series 300 Smart Lamp Runs (SLR)
When controlled by a Series 200 data signal, the VLSR stored the cue information (in much the same way that Series 200 luminaires did) and transmitted the raw positional and colour information to the luminaires, as Series 300 data. In this case, the Series 200 input connector was used to supply both power and data.
When controlled by a DMX512 data signal, all cue information is stored in and transmitted from the lighting console; with the VLSR simply acting as a translating device, which converts the DMX signal to Series 300 data in real time. In this case, the Series 200 input connector is used only to supply mains power to the VLSR, with DMX data being input via a separate, standard, 5-pin XLR connector.
The first Series 300 luminaire was the VL5 wash, released in late 1992, along with the VLSR. The VL6 spot luminaire was released in 1994 and the VL7 in 1998; with updated variants of all luminaires being developed, following their respective, initial releases.
Control consoles.
Series 100 Prototype Control Console.
Only one of these was ever built, and only had two control sections: Direct Cueing, where a memory number was entered on the keypad, assigned to the direct window and triggered by pressing the Go button, and Cross-Fade where two memories could be assigned to opposite ends of a pair of faders, and the luminaries would transition between cues. Each of the circuit cards in the system as well as the backplane of the system was hand wired, and the first operator, Dave Berger, one of the technicians who had built the unit, would take it out on tour with The Who and later with Paul Anka with the original seventeen 1st generation lites. The system was also used on The Kinks tour in 1983, then retired as new Series 100 Consoles and luminaires were built.
Series 100 Control Console.
The production version of the Series 100 console was never given a name and was generally referred to as, "the Vari-lite console". It now boasted four control methods: Direct, X-Fade, Chase and Matrix. Chase allowed a consecutive number of cues to be run automatically, although the speed had to be set by hand, and matrix allowed you to program some cues to have their intensity levels split into eight groups. The total cue storage was 256 cues, with sixteen assigned to the matrix. The remaining 239 could be used by any of the other control methods. In addition, there were two banks of sixteen programmable colour buttons, called "Preset Colours", and the active control of the luminaires could be divided into two banks of sixteen groups.
Later software versions allowed "Selective Store" and a quirk in the software allowed you to completely wipe a cue memory in a group of lites, and then only store the colour or beam information. Triggering a cue saved in this way would simply overlay the colour or beam information of a lite without changing its position. By 1986/87 it was common to see a good operator using both direct and x-fade controls overlaid by a selectively stored colour or beam chase at the same time.
Luminaires.
Prototypes.
VL-Zero.
The prototype VL-Zero (VL0) was a dichroic colour fading wash unit. The original is still in semi-working condition at PRG.
The colour change mechanism worked by twisting dichroic filters into and out of the beam path. This design proved impractical for the profile spot-type optics of the unit planned, but the idea was later revived in the company's wash luminaires, beginning with the VL3.
Series 100 luminaires.
VL1.
The VL1 (Series 100) used dichroic filter, mounted onto three wheels with seven filters each, plus an open position. A fourth wheel was fitted with five beam apertures and two gobos. Pan and Tilt used servo motors, and intensity was controlled by an iris at the front of the head.
The Upper Enclosure (UPE—the "box" on which a moving head is mounted) contained the power supply for the lamp (the APS250) and a Data Receiver Card—a PCB which translated the cue information received from the console into low voltages; these were then (mostly) sent via a wiring harness to a servo amplifier card in the head, which provided the actual power that drove the motors. The Data Receiver Card also translated the lamp Start and Douse commands from the console and fed them to the APS, allowing the lamps to be switched on and off remotely, by the console operator.
The original choice of lamp—the GE Marc 350 projector lamp, a discharge lamp with a daylight colour temperature caused several problems and a less powerful, 250W lamp had to be substituted.
The Osram HTI 250 was selected as the replacement lamp for the new VL2 after the company experienced significant troubles with the original GE MARC350 lamp. Quality issues led to limited supplies of the lamp being available and the company did not want to base a new product on the MARC350. Vari-Lite eventually tried the HTI 250 in the VL1s for the same reason, lack of supply of good MARC350 lamps. They also tested the Philips MSD 250 lamp in the VL1 with some success. They had a projected lifetime of >1000 hrs, but by that time the VL1s were nearing retirement.
860 units were built between 1981 and 1984. Most of them were destroyed, but some four units are reported to still survive, two at PRG and two built from spares are in private hands. Some units were stolen, and may also still survive.
Series 200 luminaires.
VL2 / VL2B / VL2C.
The VL2 was a moving head spot luminaire, designed to replace the VL1 and make use of the bi-directional communication afforded by the Series 200 system. In addition to Pan, Tilt and Intensity, the VL2 featured two colour wheels, with 16 positions each (15 dichroic filters plus one open position for white—see US Patent 4800474.) There was one (non-rotating) gobo wheel with 10 positions (9 gobos plus 1 open). The gobos could be easily swapped for custom designs—unlike the VL1. The gobos were mostly made from aluminium, fixed to a plastic stalk, but Vari-lite also developed a new type of glass gobo for use with the VL2 (see US Patent 4779176).
There were two other new beam functions: A beam iris to alter the diameter of the beam and a movable, multi-element front lens to sharpen or soften the beam edge.
The VL2 used an HTI-250 arc source, similar to that in the VL1, driven by an updated APS250 lamp power supply.
To this day, few—if any—automated spot luminaires, have been able to match the speed of colour and gobo change achieved by the Vari-lite VL2 and its direct descendants.
As with all Vari-lite products, the VL2 range was subject to a rolling programme of improvements and retrofits, designed to increase the reliability of what was still, in many ways, cutting-edge technology. In particular, the design of the original APS lamp power supply was notoriously unreliable but was ultimately cured by the application of the "X-mod" upgrade, which—with additional tweaks to the lamp ignitor card—vastly reduced the number of APS-related and lamp strike problems. Upgraded APS units were suffixed with "-X".
The VL2B saw the light source upgraded to a HTI-400SE, short arc discharge lamp, driven by the upgraded APS400 PSU. A very pale blue dichroic filter was replaced with 3200°K tungsten correction and the beam iris motor replaced with one of a higher resolution. VL2B luminaires can be distinguished by the absence of ventilation louvres on the rear panel of the head; which were replaced by a hinged panel, through which to access the new lamp base for bulb changes and line-up.
The VL2C further upgraded the light source to 600 W, driven by an APS600-X lamp PSU. The internal ventilation system was accordingly redesigned to better cool the head—especially the colour / gobo wheels and the beam iris leaves were upgraded for better heat resistance. The speed of the cooling fan was also increased—which led to some complaints (especially from TV studios) about noise. Detachable, external baffles were designed to cover the ventilation grilles in the side of the luminaire's Upper Enclosure (UPE), in order to deal with this issue; but could occasionally cause overheating in warm environments, leading to lamp shutdown.
The VL2C also featured an upgraded processor board, to better handle the demands made by extra features offered in later versions of the Series 200 operating system software, such as the application of timing values (rather than a simple speed) to the various functions. The VL2C can be outwardly distinguished by the presence of ventilation louvres to the rear of the top and bottom head covers and by a smaller, hinged colour / gobo access hatch, secured by a quarter-turn Zeus clip (previous versions featured a sliding hatch).
In the late 1990s, a modification was applied to the VL2C, which allowed it to be controlled from DMX512 lighting consoles, via a Vari-lite Smart DMX unit. In the UK, the remaining VL2Cs were eventually sold off to various lighting rental companies. Some may still be in existence, other than any kept for exhibition / archive units; but the difficulty of sourcing spare parts means that a significant hire stock is unlikely to be maintained in the long term.
VL3.
The Vari-lite VL3 was the company's first attempt to create a moving head wash luminaire, designed overall to light larger areas of a stage with softer-edged beams of light; in contrast with the tighter, often hard-edged beams produced by spot luminaires. The VL3 was built to complement the VL2 spot luminaire and released at the same time, in 1987, as a part of the (then) new Series 200 system. Externally, the luminaire was of an identical size and design to the VL2, save for the presence of a larger (6" / 150 mm), convex, slightly frosted lens—its key distinguishing feature. A wider range of lenses, with a variety of beam angles mimicking those found in PAR64 lamps, had been originally planned, but was not implemented on the VL3. The idea was later revived for the VL5.
Internally, the VL3 marked a return to the original idea of using twisting dichroic filters, to gradually vary the colour of the beam (see US Patent 4602321). This was made practical by the simpler optics employed in a wash luminaire, which do not produce the same beam artifacts that the optics of a spot luminaire would, using this type of colour change mechanism. The subtractive, CMY (Cyan Magenta Yellow) colour mixing system designed for the VL3, featured three sets of three dichroic filters, each set independently rotatable; with the cyan filters at the rear, closest to the lamp and the magenta filters to the front. In their "open" position, the filters sat edge-on to the axis of the light beam, so that only white light emerged. By rotating the filter sets into the path of the beam, a wide variety of colours could be created—from light pastel shades, to deep saturated hues.
A similar mechanism, with three, frosted glass vanes in place of dichroic filters, sat in front of the colour mechanism and was used to provide variable beam diffusion / width control, from a narrow spot to a wide flood. Further beam width control was introduced, with the motorisation of the lamp base; which allowed it to be moved through the reflector, along the beam axis.
Another, major departure from the VL1 and VL2, was the use of a custom-made, tungsten lamp as the light source, which ran at a maximum of 53 volts and consumed 475 Watts. This was dimmed by a new type of lamp power supply—the IPS, with "I" standing for "Induction", instead of "Arc".
Despite allowing lighting designers and programmers to create the kind of gradual colour changes and soft edged washes which were unachievable with the VL1 and VL2, the VL3 was not a long term success; mainly due to the tungsten lamp not being bright enough to handle longer throws, especially when set in darker colours. This compromised its ability to provide frontal illumination, reducing its role to mostly backlighting and beam effects. The VL3 began to replaced by the VL4 from 1991. There may be a one or two left in existence, for exhibition / archive purposes, but the vast majority had been converted to VL2B luminaires by the end of 1994, which in turn were later upgraded to VL2Cs.
A large number of VL3 luminaires can be seen surrounding the central, circular screen, in videos of Pink Floyd's "Delicate Sound of Thunder" tour.
VL4.
Marketed under the strapline, "Smaller, Lighter, Faster, Brighter", the Vari-lite VL4 was the company's second moving head wash luminaire, designed to replace and improve upon the VL3. It was first made available for rental in 1990.
At roughly half the size and weight of its predecessor, the VL4 did much to address market concerns regarding the size and weight of moving lights in general. A customised 400W short arc discharge lamp, updated from the one employed in the VL2B and coupled with a chemically brightened aluminium reflector, ensured that the output far exceeded that of the disappointing VL3.
The subtractive, CMY colour change mechanism was a reduced-size version of the one used in the VL3, but beam diffusion was handled by a tambour-inspired design; with motor-driven, vertical slats of increasingly diffuse glass, that were drawn (internally) across the front end of the luminaire from both sides (see US Patent No. 4972306). As with the VL3, further beam width control was achieved by moving the motorised lamp back and forth inside the reflector, along the beam axis.
Intensity control was provided via a mechanical shutter (the discharge lamp being non-dimmable). A second, "strobe" shutter, designed to snap open and closed as fast as possible, was incorporated into the intensity mechanism.
The VL4 also featured a 12-bit Motorola processor, over the 8-bit one used in the VL2 and VL3.
Despite being a technical improvement over the VL3, the small size and compact design of the VL4 led to a number of reliability issues—particularly with overheating. The densely constructed and relatively front-heavy head of the luminaire was also prone to overshooting (and then bouncing back to) its intended position at the end of fast movements. Many problems were addressed in a major upgrade programme, carried out over several weeks in the early 1990s, which featured over 135 modifications to the design. These ranged from the simple placement of a blob of rubber sealant somewhere in the luminaire, to the wholesale stripping down, extensive modification and total rebuilding of the Pan and Tilt mechanisms, to combat the overshooting problem.
The new, compacted design of the APS400 lamp power supply suffered similar problems to the earlier APS power supplies, although these were mostly cured with the eventual application of the "X-mod".
Ultimately, the small size of the luminaire made it impossible to upgrade the light source to a brighter, 600 Watt lamp (as had been done with the VL2C upgrade). Increasingly bright, competing luminaires from rival manufacturers, coupled with continuing reliability issues and high maintenance costs, saw the VL4 largely replaced by the VL5 within a decade of the latter's release. Very few remained in service beyond the first years of the 21st century and fewer still are in existence today, except maybe a couple held for exhibition / archive purposes.
Series 300 luminaires.
VL5 / VL5 ARC / VL5B.
The VL5 was the third moving head wash luminaire to be produced by Vari-lite and was released in September 1992. It uses the Dichro-Tune radial CMY color mixing system (see US Patents 5073847 and 5186536). This system gives smoother transitions between colours and more even pastel shades, than that used in the VL3 and VL4; but is slower in end-to-end travel and gives the fixture the unmistakable black dot at the front of the fixture. A fourth set of vanes carry diffused glass to soften / widen the beam. Unlike the VL4, there is no other beam control; although the native beam angle can be pre-set using interchangeable lenses, which mimic the beam angles found in PAR64 lamps (an idea first proposed for the VL3).
Design-wise, the VL5 responded to calls from entertainment lighting designers, for lighter, simpler, more reliable and (above all) cheaper moving light technology, which did not have to be controlled by a proprietary console. It was the first Series 300 luminaire, which could be controlled by either Vari-lite Series 200 data, or DMX512-A data, via a Vari-lite Smart Repeater (VLSR) box.
Whichever data type was used, the mains voltage tungsten lamp used in the VL5 is dimmed remotely; using standard, stage lighting dimmer technology. This considerably reduced the cost of the luminaire and removed the need for a large upper enclosure, it being possible to incorporate the remaining electronics in the yoke of the unit. The lamp itself was an updated design by Philips, strengthened to withstand the forces on the white-hot filament caused by high-speed movement of the head.
The VL5 was the first moving light to use "cold mirror" technology to provide a cool, high-intensity light beam, which could be placed close to objects and people, without burning them. The VL5s reflector is, in fact, a very large dichroic filter, which only allows infra-red light to pass through it, while reflecting the remaining visible light forward. The idea had been in use for some time before, most notably in MR16 halogen downlighter lamps, but never scaled up to this level. The prototype VL5 cold mirror reflector allegedly cost US$100,000 to produce. The idea works well in producing a cool beam output, but can raise the rear end of the head to flesh-searing temperatures, after just a few minutes' operation at maximum intensity.
The VL5 was the first convection-cooled moving light, requiring no fan and therefore producing almost no noise. This has made it a popular choice for television lighting and other noise-sensitive applications.
The VL5 Arc introduced a 575W discharge lamp to the design. As this could not be electronically dimmed, the diffuser vanes were replaced with black metal ones, which acted as a mechanical dimmer.
Beam width control was initially carried out using an innovative "Liquid Lens"—again designed by Jim Bornhorst (see US Patent 5774273)—which pumped a liquid silica-based gel into a series of lentil-shaped cavities, set between two plastic membranes—thus altering their refractive index and giving a variable beam angle of 13–34°. However, this range fell short of that originally promised in the R&D stage and was not generally wide enough, to be useful for creating the kind of broad washes of soft-edged light, normally expected by users from this class of luminaire. The liquid lens fell further out of favour, after some users obtained the MSDS for the gel being used in the lens and expressed concerns at its potential toxicity. Following this, many VL5 Arcs were rented out without the liquid lens, using instead the same, fixed-focus range of lenses designed for the original VL5.
The original VL5 had offered a wider range of green shades than the VL4, but enabling it to do so had compromised its ability to produce pale, daylight and "steel" shades of blue—which are more useful to lighting designers, especially those working in Theatre and TV. The VL5B featured an alternative filter set, which restored the ability to produce pale blues, but reduced the overall number of useful colours available—especially darker, more saturated shades in the blue-green range. As a result, the VL5B is mostly used in Theatre and TV productions, where its specialised colour range is more often specifically required. The VL5B uses the same, 1000W tungsten lamp as the original VL5, powered by remote dimmers.
The VL5 has proved to be Vari-lite's most long-lived product and is one of the most popular stage lighting units, of any kind, ever made—with over 3,500 built. Its simple workings, ease of maintenance and overall reliability, have made it a favourite among lighting crews for almost twenty years and—as of 2010—it is still readily available for hire from a number of rental companies; continuing to illuminate stages around the world. The smooth, elegant, early-1990s design—informed by the classic PAR64 Parcan lantern—has not dated appreciably and still looks "current" when used alongside more modern equipment—to the extent that the basic look of the head has been carried (along with that of the VL6), into many, post-Series 300 Vari-lite luminaires.
VL6 / VL6B / VL6C / VL6C Plus.
The Vari-lite VL6 was designed to complement the VL5, as a simple, lightweight, cheap-to-hire, moving head spot luminaire; but did not appear on the market until mid-1994—almost two years after the VL5. As a Series 300 luminaire, it could be controlled either by Vari-lite Series 200 data or DMX512, via a Vari-lite Smart Repeater (VLSR) unit.
The unusual "cyclops" design carried just two wheels: one for colour and one for gobos, each with 12 positions (including 1 open). The dichroic filters and gobos in the VL6 were interchangeable between the two wheels. With gobos set in both wheels and placed in the beam path, it is possible to "morph" between them, by adjusting the focus of the motorised lens (See US Patent No. 5934794). Placing dichroic filters in both wheels, allows additional colours to be created beyond the basic palette afforded by a single wheel, although this potential has not been widely explored.
A new process of laser-etching very high resolution designs, onto the very small glass gobos designed for the VL6, was developed and patented by Vari-lite (see US Patent No. 5728994).
A custom HTI-400 discharge lamp was once again chosen for the light source, requiring mechanical dimming and fans to cool the head of the luminaire; although these were smaller and considerably quieter, than those used in previous luminaires. As with the VL5, a dichroic, "cold mirror" was used as the reflector. Like the VL5, the VL6 had no upper enclosure and a new, modular, rack-mounted version of the APS power supply (the APS6) was designed to remotely power the lamps, via VLSRs. Six APS6 units could be mounted in one rack at a time.
A dimmer dimmer module (the C3) with the same overall form as the APS6 was also designed, with the intention of allowing the lamps of VL5s and VL6s to be powered together, from the same lamp PSU rack, via a common VLSR. However, in Europe, the limitations of the C3 circuitry meant that insufficient voltage could be produced, to raise the 230V version of the VL5 lamp to its maximum possible intensity; leaving the output looking dim and yellow. There was also the potential for accidental connection of VL6 lamps to dimmed mains supplies on "mixed" VLSRs, which rendered the lamps instantly and permanently useless. As a result, VL5 lamps continued to be mostly driven by third party dimmers and VL6s by APS racks, with the two types of luminaire usually running on separate VLSRs.
The lightweight design of the VL6, meant that much faster moves were possible than with previous Vari-lite spots; although this was compromised by the weight added in the VL6B upgrade.
Performed in 1998, the VL6B upgrade added a wider aperture zoom lens, with a 13−35° range and an additional rotating gobo wheel, with 5+1 positions. This added considerable weight to the head of the luminaire and made it front-heavy, to the extent that a counterweight was required to provide balance and bolted to the outside of the rear of the head.
The VL6C upgraded the light source to 600 W, with commensurate measures taken to improve head cooling, heat resistance and to upgrade the APS6 lamp power supplies.
In December 2007, The Production Resource Group (PRG) completed an upgrade of their entire stock of 1,200 VL6C luminaires to accept a 700W short arc discharge lamp. Modifications to the airflow system were made to improve the reliability of circuit boards and motors, with upgraded wiring and connectors for all motors and pan/tilt mechanisms. Improvements to the ignitor reduced the hot restrike time from 8 minutes to 1 minute and a new lamp douse switch was fitted, to allow lamp power to be disconnected at the luminaire itself. This upgraded version of the VL6C is referred to as the VL6C Plus.
VL7 / VL7B.
The VL7 spot luminaire marked a return to a much larger design. As a Series 300 luminaire, it could be controlled by either Series 200 data from an Artisan console, or DMX512 data from a third party lighting console, via a VLSR unit. The Philips MSR 700 SA lamp, with a colour temperature of 5600°K, was chosen for the light source and driven remotely, from newly upgraded APS6 lamp power supplies.
In keeping with its predecessors, the VL7 featured a number of innovations. First and foremost (at least from a marketing point of view) was the CVF colour system. This featured neither wheels nor twisting filters, but rather a pair of comparatively large, oblong, dichroic filter plates, which could be moved in the vertical and horizontal plane. Each plate carried three basic shades, carefully graduated to merge across the longer, horizontal plane. In the vertical plane, the three basic shades were progressively etched away with lasers, so that they were fully saturated at the top, but completely clear at the bottom. One filter plate carried the colours red, green and blue; while the other carried cyan, magenta and yellow. US Patent Nos. 5825548 and 5969868 describe the concepts behind the CVF colour system. Both patents make mention of a colour wheel and a fixed position wheel was included in the finished luminaire. This could carry both colours and/or gobos, but was mostly used for the latter. There was also a rotating gobo wheel, with a total of six positions and a strobe shutter, which could run at up to 7.25 Hz.
A further, more subtle innovation, saw the use of a new, collection optics system, that guaranteed a much flatter and more even beam than had been produced by previous Vari-lite luminaires, which were prone to "hot spots" if not set up correctly. The ideas behind this component of the VL7 were described in US Patent No. 6123436
The quest for optical excellence continued with the near projection-quality zoom zens; which featured an unprecedented 8:1 ratio, in the shape of a 5–40° beam angle range—a feature made more remarkable, by its highly compact design (see US Patent No. 6046861).
Despite these innovations and Vari-lite's previous experience, development of the VL7 was fraught with problems; originally unveiled in 1997, it was not released onto the market until 1998. Behind schedule, over-budget and not fully tested, the initial run of VL7 luminaires immediately fell victim to a wide range of teething troubles, for which—in most cases—there was no immediate cure. This left technicians only able to replace failed parts, rather than fix the problems which were causing them to fail. For example: a problem in the CVF, which caused the teeth to soften and become stripped from the belts that drove the filter plates, was traced to their drive gears, which had been made of a material with a high Specific Heat Capacity. Once this was understood, the gears could be changed, but not before several hundred belts had already required replacement. Further problems with the CVF caused cracks to appear in the (expensive) filter plates, although this did not always immediately affect the quality of the beam output.
Even when the CVF's mechanical bugs were cured, the fact remained that it often travelled through a range of green-coloured shades, in between the start and end colours of a change. Although "all" additive (RGB) or subtractive (CMY) will produce a tertiary colour—which may sometimes become visually dominant, in an aesthetically displeasing way—when cross-fading between a primary and secondary hue; it is "always" a product of and therefore more likely to harmonise with, the hues at the start and end of the colour change. Green was not regarded by users as a pleasant alternative to this and although a programming workaround was developed by operators, it was a time-consuming process to apply to multiple cues, that slowed down the speed of colour changes.
The luminaire had been released before the new, Series 200 software version required to control it from an Artisan was completely ready and—to begin with—it could only be controlled as a DMX luminaire, from a non-Vari-lite console.
Maintenance was complicated by the location of some sub-assemblies in the luminaire, the Pan unit proving especially difficult to replace.
The VL7 also featured more cooling fans than previous Vari-lite luminaires—a total of four and despite marketing claims of "virtually silent operation", the noise they produced did not go unnoticed by users.
The VL7B replaced the fixed colour / gobo wheel, with a four-leaf motorised shutter gate, which could be used to mask the edges of the beam and could be rotated by 50°. The maximum speed of the strobe shutter was also increased slightly, to 8 Hz.
The VL7 design was not a long-lasting success—certainly when compared to its Series 300 stablemates. Its unwieldy shape, size, weight and noisiness, plus the difficulty of maintenance and early unreliability, combined to make it unpopular with lighting technicians, operators and designers alike. By this time and despite Vari-lite's vigorous defence of their patents, there was a ready choice of alternatives available from competing manufacturers, which offered the same functions and brighter outputs. Many—if not most VL7s—were eventually returned to the VLPS agencies by sub-distributors and rental associates, to be hired only if specifically requested for a production.
Series 2000 luminaires.
VL2416 Wash luminaire.
Despite its numerical designation, this was the first new luminaire to be produced following the VL7 and hence became unofficially known as the "VL8" among American crews. The VL2416 marked a major sea-change in the Vari-lite business model, in that it was the first Vari-lite luminaire that could actually be purchased. Previous luminaires had (in)famously been available for rental only.
The head was closely based on that of the VL5 Arc, with radial CMY colour mixing and mechanical shutter dimming fast enough to also provide strobe effects.
The liquid lens was discarded and beam width controlled instead, by a new type of zoom optics(see US Patent 6809869). This uses two plates of glass; one with a surface covered in several dozen, small (<10 mm), convex lenses and the other moulded with corresponding, concave depressions, into which the lenses precisely fit. When the plates are brought together, they effectively form a flat piece of glass, through which light passes unaffected. Moving the plates apart increases the angle of the beam, producing a very wide range of angles (5–55° in this luminaire) over a very short range of travel (<25 mm)—leading to a compact design with rapid operation (1.2 seconds end-to-end). A similar system can be seen in operation on some, early 21st-century LED stage lighting fixtures, with a variable beam angle function.
As this was a self-contained luminaire, the Upper Enclosure (UPE) was restored to the design, to carry the lamp power supply and DMX related electronics.
The VL2416 could only be controlled with DMX data. There was no facility for control from a proprietary Vari-lite console.
Other products and accessories.
VLM.
The VLM (Vari*Lite Mirror) was a result of a brainstorming session to try and solve the problems of never being able to offer every possible luminaire in an automated yoke. Vari-Lite designed a unit which was basically a two sided metal mirror mounted inside a Series 300 yoke. The tilt end stops were removed giving the unit the ability to spin continuously on that axis.
The units were used with much success on a series of Belgium TV shows where they were used in conjunction with a series of Robert Juliat 1200w profiles. However, a limited number of units were produced and they never became a mainstream product.
VLDi.
The VLDi (Vari*Lite Dimmer interface) was a 96 channel 0−10v analogue interface between a conventional dimmer unit and the Series 200 control system. Each unit took up 100 of the 1000 available control channels, which gave the Artisan control console considerable potential. However, in many cases at the time the Lighting Designer on a show and the Vari*Lite operator were different people, and so many designers opted to retain the conventional lighting console. As well as this, the Artisan had been designed to control moving lights and did not provide many of the tools that conventional lighting desk operators had come to use.
The final nail in the coffin for the VLDi was the mass migration of the lighting industry to the DMX512 protocol.
The "i" in the VLDi acronym is still generally included in all verbal and written communications referring to the product. This is done to avoid potential confusion with the initials of Vari-lite Deutschland (VLD).
Mini ACS Rack.
A single-output version of the Series 200 ACS Rack, designed mainly for test purposes.
Smart DMX.
Introduced to replace the obsolete VLDi, the Vari-lite Smart DMX unit converted Series 200 data into DMX512 data, allowing control over conventional, third-party dimmers, from Vari-lite's proprietary Artisan console. This was used mainly to control dimmers which were powering the lamps of VL5, but also to control "conventional" portions of stage lighting systems, without the need (and cost) of a second console and operator.
Floyd Droid.
A custom-built effects unit, designed for Pink Floyd's "Delicate Sound of Thunder" tour. Four were built and respectively nicknamed Manny, Moe, Jack, and Cloyd . They featured arrays of motor-driven mirrors, and (mostly) scanned multiple, tight beams of light over the audience; while avoiding potential hazards to vision, associated with producing such effects using high-power lasers.
Irideon Inc..
History.
Irideon, Inc. was a subsidiary company formed by Vari-lite in 1994, to target the architectural lighting market by offering colour-changing luminaires, able to dramatically illuminate buildings and outdoor structures in ways which—until then—could only be imagined.
Two Irideon luminaires were initially produced: The AR500 and the AR5.
Irideon Inc. was sold to Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) in November 1998; as a result of the difficult conditions experienced by Vari-lite, during their first year of trading on the stock market. Under ETC's stewardship, the AR50 was completed and a two new luminaires—the AR6 and AR250—were created.
Manuals for some Irideon luminaires are still available from ETC.
Irideon Luminaires.
In chronological order:
AR500.
A large, metal cased luminaire, designed for outdoor use and finished in a grey powder coat.
The Pan and Tilt functions were not motorised, so the luminaire should perhaps not be considered as a true moving light.
Colours were created using the same, radial DICHRO*TUNE mechanism that had been developed for the VL5. As with the VL5, there was also a set of diffuser vanes to alter the beam width. A further set of black metal vanes were used to control intensity, as the luminaire employed a 500W discharge lamp as a light source, driven by an internal lamp power supply.
AR5.
A much smaller luminaire, with a head approximately 300mm in length, available in a black or white finish and designed for indoor use. All functions were motorised, including Pan and Tilt, making the AR5 a true moving light.
Colour, Intensity and Diffusion were handled by miniaturised versions of the mechanisms used in the AR500, using just eight vanes per set, instead of sixteen.
The light source was a 35W discharge lamp, powered from an internal supply.
AR6.
A recessed, non-moving version of the AR5. Mounted inside a case designed to fit within the area of a standard ceiling tile and intended for use in downlight applications.
AR50.
A larger version of the AR5, with all functions motorised. Development was apparently begun under Vari-lite ownership of Irideon and completed by ETC.
AR250 / AR250C.
A smaller version (plus variant) of the original AR500, with non-motorised Pan and Tilt and a 250W discharge light source.

Duel Personalities

Duel Personalities is a 1939 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by George Sidney. It was the 177th "Our Gang" short (178th episode, 89th talking short, 90th talking episode, and 9th MGM produced episode) that was released.
Plot.
Upset that his youthful sweetheart Darla has once again thrown him over in favor of neighborhood bully Butch, Alfalfa tries to forget his troubles by watching a sidewalk performance by famed hypnotist Professor William Delmore. Chosen as a subject, Alfalfa is hypnotized into believing that he is the fearless D'Artagnan, of Three Musketeers fame. Armed with this bold new personality, Alfalfa not only sweeps Darla off her feet, but also challenges the dumbfounded Butch to a duel. The results, while not deadly, are devastating.
Notes.
Coincidentally, the professor's assistant is played by actor Phillip Terry, who would marry Joan Crawford a couple years later. He worked with at MGM with Joan Crawford, which is where they met. This film was ranked as slightly above average, though the series would continue to go downhill in the coming months.
