List of locomotive depots in Germany

This list of locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerke) in Germany includes all those within the borders of the Deutsches Reich in 1937, which were at sometime between 1920 and 1994 independent facilities. They are grouped by the divisions ("Direktionen") that existed in 1994, with the exception of those divisions east of the Oder-Neisse line. The year when they were closed as independent depots is given in brackets after the name. For a list of currently active locomotive depots in Germany see the List of Deutsche Bahn locomotive depots.

William Woodman Graham

William Woodman Graham ( – ) was a British mountaineer who led the first pure mountaineering expedition to the Himalayas and may have set a world altitude record on Kabru.
Motivated by adventure rather than a desire for fame, Graham had little interest in publicising his climbs, and as a result relatively little is known about his life and achievements. He is known to have climbed extensively in the Alps, reaching most of the major summits and making the first ascent of the Dent du Géant in 1882.
Himalayan expedition.
In 1883, shortly after he had qualified as a barrister, Graham made a visit to the Himalayas in the company of Swiss Alpine guide Josef Imboden of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais. While many of the lower mountains of the Himalaya had been climbed by surveyors and explorers, mainly to make observations of more distant peaks, Graham was the first person to visit the range solely for the purpose of mountaineering. He spent the spring trekking in the region of Kanchenjunga, but he was forced to return to Darjeeling by the cold weather and the fact that a porter had accidentally burned his boots.
Once in Darjeeling, Imboden, who had contracted fever, was replaced by the Swiss guides Ulrich Kaufmann and Emile Boss, who had made the first ascent of Mount Cook the previous year. At the end of June the party set off for Garhwal where they explored the region around Nanda Devi. Unable to penetrate the Nanda Devi Sanctuary they turned their attention towards Dunagiri, where Graham claimed to have reached a height of around 22,700 ft (6,920 m) before being forced to retreat by bad weather. 
Graham and his companions next attempted a nearby peak, which they believed was the one marked on the map as A21, now known as Changabang. They made an ascent by the West Ridge, which Graham described as "a fair climb, but that presented no great difficulties." Modern observers, however, agree that whatever mountain Graham climbed it was not Changabang, which from the west presents a sheer wall which was not climbed until 1976, and certainly not the easy ridge that Graham described. It is more likely that he was on the wrong mountain; possibly a subsidiary summit on the southern ridge of Dunagiri.
Graham's confusion was partly due to the poor quality of the maps of the area, and on his return to civilisation he was critical of the Great Trigonometric Survey, suggesting that its surveyors should be trained in mountaineering by the Swiss Army, whom he credited with the finest cartographic work in the world at the time. The criticism was not well received by the Survey, and it may have made Graham more enemies to cast doubt on his accomplishments.
After the Garhwal trip, Graham and his companions returned to the Kanchenjunga area for the climax of their campaign; an attempt on Kabru, which Graham claimed to have climbed by the East Face in three days, reaching the summit on 8 September. Kabru, at 7,349 m (24,111 ft), was far higher than any other mountain climbed at the time, and its ascent was and remains the most controversial aspect of Graham's expedition. Doubt was cast on whether he really had climbed this mountain or whether he had mistaken a nearby, lower mountain called Forked Peak (6,200 m, 20,340 ft) for Kabru. His ascent was doubted by members of the GTS, and by contemporaries including Martin Conway and William Hunter Workman (both of whom had rival claims to the world altitude record). However, it was supported by climbers such as Norman Collie, Thomas Longstaff and Douglas Freshfield — Freshfield having travelled extensively in the same area himself. In his history of Himalayan climbing Kenneth Mason argued that Graham had not climbed Kabru, pointing to the vagueness of his description of the mountain, inconsistencies between his account and modern observations of the mountain, the remarkably quick ascent he claimed, and the fact that he appeared to have suffered little or no altitude sickness on his ascent. In a more recent history, Walt Unsworth argued that the vagueness of Graham's account was to be expected from a man who was a mountaineer rather than a surveyor, and that now Mount Everest has been climbed in a single day without oxygen, Graham's claims seem less outlandish than they once did, so that he should perhaps be credited with the ascent after all. The controversy remains unresolved.
Later life.
After Kabru, Graham attempted several other mountains in the area, but the onset of winter prevented him from making serious progress on any of them. He disappeared from mountaineering history after his year in the Himalayas, and after making his initial report of his Himalayan expedition he never made any further comment or engaged in the ensuing controversy. For many years it was rumoured that he lost all his money and ended his days as a cowboy in the United States, but in fact he served as British Consul in Durango, Mexico, from 1910 until 1932. The year of his death is unknown.

<doc id="19675942" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19675942" title="Frame technology (software engineering)">
Frame technology (software engineering)

Frame technology (FT) is a language-neutral (i.e., processes various languages) system that manufactures custom software from reusable, machine-adaptable building blocks, called frames. FT is used to reduce the time, effort, and errors involved in the design, construction, and evolution of large, complex software systems. Fundamental to FT is its ability to stop the proliferation of similar but subtly different components, an issue plaguing software engineering, for which programming language constructs (subroutines, classes, or templates/generics) or add-in techniques such as macros and generators failed to provide a practical, scalable solution.
A number of implementations of FT exist. Netron Fusion specializes in constructing business software and is proprietary. XVCL is a general-purpose, open-source implementation of FT. Paul G. Bassett invented the first FT in order to automate the repetitive, error-prone editing involved in adapting (generated and hand-written) programs to changing requirements and contexts. 
A substantial literature now exists that explains how FT can facilitate most aspects of software’s life-cycle, including domain modeling, requirements gathering, architecture and design, construction, testing, documentation, fine tuning and evolution. Independent comparisons of FT to alternative approaches confirm that the time and resources needed to build and maintain complex systems can be substantially reduced. One reason: FT shields programmers from software’s inherent redundancies: FT has reproduced COTS object-libraries from equivalent XVCL frame libraries that are two-thirds smaller and simpler; custom business applications are routinely specified and maintained by [http://www.netron.com Netron FusionSPC frames that are 5% – 15% of the size of their assembled source files.
Frames.
Below are two informal descriptions, followed by a more precise definition and explanation. 
Formally, a frame is a procedural macro consisting of frame-text – zero or more lines of ordinary (program) text and frame commands (that are carried out by FT’s frame processor as it manufactures custom programs). Each frame is both a generic component in a hierarchy of nested subassemblies, and a procedure for integrating itself with its subassembly frames (a recursive process that resolves integration conflicts in favor of higher level subassemblies). The outputs are custom documents, typically compilable source modules. 
The main commands.
The processor transforms frame-text by replacing commands with ordinary text, and by emitting ordinary text as is. Examples: It replaces an "invoke" by the result of processing the invoked frame; it replaces an "assign" with nothing; and an "instantiate" becomes the ordinary text resulting from evaluating the frame parameter’s assigned expression, which can be a concatenation of strings, arithmetic expressions, and nested frame parameters.
Component relationships.
"Invoke" sets up component relationships among frames. For example, in figure 1: F is J’s component and C is J’s subcomponent. Of course, many components may "invoke" the same subcomponent, as in I and J invoking F, each constructing a different text. The overall component structure forms a generic semilattice, with each frame being the root of a subassembly. Thus C is its own subassembly; F and C are components of the F subassembly, and J, F, and C are components of the J subassembly. 
Context scoping.
Context scoping is what distinguishes FT from other modeling and construction systems: Each frame constitutes the context into which it integrates its subassembly. In nested subassemblies the lower levels are progressively more context-free because they integrate less information. Integration conflicts are resolved in favor of the most context-sensitive frame to assign or insert a parameter – it becomes read-only to all other frames in that frame’s subassembly. In figure 1, frames F and C would conflict if they assign different values to parameter "p". So F overrides C – i.e., the frame processor ignores C’s assignment(s) to "p", and uses F’s value(s) for "p" in F and C. Similarly, J can override both F and C, and so on. 
Context-scoping matters because all the adjustments needed to fit any number of (sub)components to a given context are explicit and local to that context. Without context-scoping such adjustments are mostly implicit, scattered and hidden within component variants. Not only do such variants tend to proliferate, causing unnecessary redundancy and complexity, but system evolution is also unnecessarily difficult and error-prone.
Specification frames and templates.
A specification frame (SPC) is an entire assembly’s topmost, hence most context-sensitive frame. The processor starts at an SPC, such as L or M in figure 1, in order to manufacture a complete program or subsystem. While in principle an SPC could customize every detail, in practice an SPC is a small fraction of its entire assembly because most of the exceptions (and exceptions to exceptions, etc.) have already been handled by various subassembly frames.
Given a frame library, SPCs logically entail the programs they construct; thus SPCs replace source files as primary control points. It’s routine practice to use templates to create SPCs that create programs, then use SPCs to manage and evolve those programs indefinitely. This practice greatly reduces the number of details that application programmers must know and manage. It also avoids the redundancies, complexities, and errors inherent in copying and editing source texts by hand. Debugging time shrinks as well because most components are reused, hence pretested. Errors tend to localize in SPCs, as they are the least tested. 
A template is an archetypal SPC, with embedded comments explaining how to customize it. Typically, there is a small number of types of programs, each type being characterized by a template. By copying and filling it in, programmers convert a template into an SPC without having to remember what frames they need, their component relationships, or what details typically need to be customized.
Frame-based domain-specific languages.
An FT-based, domain-specific language (FT-DSL) is a domain-specific language whose semantics (expressed in program code) have been engineered into frames. A typical FT-DSL editor translates between DSL expressions and a frame that will adapt the framed semantics to express program-code equivalents of the DSL expressions. An SPC sitting atop this subassembly can then specify in program code any customizations inexpressible in the domain-specific language. Thus when users regenerate program code from altered DSL expressions, prior customizations are not lost.
Frame engineering.
Frame engineering applies software engineering to a frame technology environment. This includes domain analysis, designing, writing, testing, and co-evolving frames along with the systems they construct. Framing occurs both bottom–up and top–down. Bottom–up, frame engineers typically create frames by unifying and parameterizing groups of similar program elements (of any granularity, from text snippets to subsystems) into generic equivalents. The top–down approach combines domain expertise with iterative prototype refinement, constrained by application and architectural requirements, corporate standards, and the desire to evolve a set of reusable assets whose return greatly exceeds the investment. (Reuse is measured by dividing the total size of the frame libraries into the total size of the resulting constructs, and/or by counting individual frame reuses.)
A mature frame library enhances cost-effectiveness because software project stakeholders can restrict their attention to a system’s novelties, taking the bulk of its robust components and architecture for granted. A mature library is not static. Frame engineers can, using the select command, evolve reusable frames indefinitely, meeting new requirements without necessitating retrofits to programs manufactured from frames’ previous versions.

Drumshoreland railway station

Drumshoreland railway station was a railway station in West Lothian, Scotland. It was located on the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway.
History.
Opened in 1849 as Broxburn, it replaced the station of the same name on the nearby Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. Subsequently renamed as Drumshoreland in 1870, the station was closed in 1951.
The station had a small two road goods yard on the south of the line, and 3 chains east of the station a trailing junction joined the up line from Albyn oil works in Broxburn, forming a branch to that site. 9 chains north of the mainline (between Broxburn and the M8 motorway) a line branched west and crossed the mainline near to the hamlet of Cawburn. The line passed behind the cottages and connected to the Camps Branch. A further trailing junction connected this spur to the main up line. Further east, between Drumshoreland and Bathgate (Newbridge) junction, a branch left the up line and headed north east, passing under the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway to serve Newliston shale mine (just south of Kirkliston). The course of these lines can be seen on sheet 73 within this link (Ordnance Survey Maps One-inch "Popular" edition, Scotland, 1921-1930) on the National Library of Scotland digital library (Maps)[http://www.nls.uk/maps/index.html

Peter Stringfellow (footballer)

Peter Stringfellow (born 21 February 1939) is an English former professional association football player. He played for Oldham Athletic, Gillingham and Chesterfield between 1958 and 1965, making more than 100 appearances in the Football League, but his professional career came to an end after he was involved in a car crash which killed a team-mate.
Career.
Stringfellow was born in Walkden in Lancashire and began his career playing for local team Walkden Town. He had a short spell with Manchester City but never played a match for the club. He moved to nearby Oldham Athletic in December 1958. An inside forward, he spent two seasons with the club, playing 54 times in the Football League and scoring 16 goals. He was the team's top scorer during the 1959–60 season with 11 goals, but was then forced to leave the club when he was posted to Malaya with the Royal Air Force.
He later played for the non-league club GKN Sankey, based in Wellington, Shropshire, and then, upon leaving the Air Force, joined Gillingham in December 1962. He made his debut for the club the following April in a home match against Newport County. In the 1963–64 season he made 25 appearances and helped the club to win the championship of the Football League Fourth Division. At the end of the season, however, manager Freddie Cox decided that Stringfellow would not feature in his plans at the higher level, and the player moved to Chesterfield in an exchange deal which saw Charlie Rackstraw move in the opposite direction. Stringfellow made 28 appearances for the "Spireites", scoring seven goals, but in December 1964 he was involved in a car crash in which team-mate Ralph Hunt (the brother of Stringfellow's former Gillingham team-mate Dennis Hunt) was killed and two other players injured. Stringfellow had been driving the car which crashed, but no responsibility was attached to him for the accident. Nonetheless, following the accident, his form dramatically declined and he was allowed to leave Saltergate at the end of the season. He chose to emigrate to Australia, and no details are known of his subsequent life.

Biography.
Annie Lööf was born and raised in Maramö outside Värnamo. She still lives in Värnamo. During her last year at Finnvedens Secondary School in Värnamo, where she studied social sciences, she developed an interest in politics, and at the end of 2001, she joined the Centre Party. During the 2002 election, she was employed as an election-agent for the Centre Party Youth in Jönköping County and was the same year awarded the Dag Hammarskjöld Award for her commitment to international environmental issues and peace. After the election, she enrolled to study law at Lund University and graduated in August 2011 with a law degree.
In the general election in 2006, she was elected a member of the Riksdag and for the parliamentary period of 2006-2010, becoming Sweden's then-youngest member of its legislature. 
In January 2007 Lööf, along with her colleague Fredrick Federley, initiated the Liberal Group, a network of liberal-minded people inside and outside the Riksdag. She has also been the deputy chairman of the Centre Party Youth. For several years, she served on the board of the Nordic Centre Youth Federation, Scandinavia's second largest youth organization.
In 2008, Lööf was awarded the "Young European Leadership Program" grant from the United States Embassy.
Career.
Assignments.
Before she became a minister and party leader, Annie Lööf was member of the Committee on Finance, the War Delegation and a deputy of the Committee on Justice and first deputy group leader for the Centre Party's parliamentary group and member of the party's executive board. 
She has served as a member on several government commissions, including the E-Publicity Committee, the investigation of the police needs of signal intelligence and in the signals intelligence committee, which evaluated the National Defence Radio Establishment activities.
During her two terms, she has been active in municipal politics in Värnamo, as deputy of the City Council from 2002 to 2004, as member of the Citizens' Board from 2002 to 2004, as well as ordinary municipal councillor from 2006 to 2007. Lööf was also elected to the local councils for Värnamo in 2010, but left the mission because of many national commitments.
Until 2008, Lööf was a substitute to the Nordic Council's Swedish delegation, and the pre-term in office she worked for the Committee on the Constitution as a member.
In addition to her duties as member of the Riksdag, Lööf have for four years been a member of the Youth Board's advisory council and for two years in the Director of Coompanion - Cooperative Development Sweden.
After the 2010 general election, Lööf was elected Chairman of the National Post-Election Analysis Group the Centre Party appointed. The Analysis Group presented its report in January 2011. The same year she became economic spokesperson of her party. On 31 August 2011 the Centre Party proposed Annie Lööf as the new party chairman and on the party's congress in Åre on 23 September she was elected by acclamation.
Party leader and Minister for Enterprise.
Lööf was elected party leader and party chairman on September 23, 2011, succeeding Maud Olofsson. She thus became the Centre Party's youngest ever party chairman.
On 29 September 2011 Lööf succeeded Maud Olofsson as Minister for Enterprise. She also saw to replace Minister for the Environment Andreas Carlgren with Lena Ek while the Minister for Rural Affairs Eskil Erlandsson kept his seat.
During Almedalsveckan 2012, in her address at the Centre Party gathering, Lööf criticized the government she was a part of for inability to keep up the pace of reform that had been a leading part of the Alliance platform in 2006, and urged a revival. "The joint project has lost momentum. Project embers have died down," she said. These points were met with fierce opposition from the other cabinet parties, mainly from the Christian Democrats and the party secretary Acko Ankarberg. The speech also drew attention because of the caustic review by Social Democrat former secretary of culture Marita Ulvskog: "New speechwriter for Annie Lööf? unfortunately didn't help. Credibility none. Would work in Top Model, not in reality" she wrote on Twitter. Ulvskog later apologized for some of the wprdings.
On 6 August 2012 Lööf dismissed Christina Lugnet, the Director-General of Tillväxtverket, after it had become known that Lugnet's government agency had spent approximately 16 million SEK on mostly internal representation over a brief period of time: banquets, kick-offs, hotel stays for its personnel and conferences. This was out of bounds under Swedish law and by the agency's own rules.
On August 8, it became known that Lööf used taxpayers' money for a number of restaurant visits, including banquets for her staff. A memo was revealed to have amounted 20 000 SEK. The Centre Party has subsequently repaid these expenses to the treasury, as it was for party activities.
Personal life.
Lööf is the daughter of Centre Party politician Hans-Göran Johansson, the current Mayor of Värnamo Municipality. On 30 July 2011 Lööf married Carl-Johan Carlsson. They adopted Lööf as their common surname.

Hitchin Yeshiva

Yeshivas Toras Chessed is a Jewish yeshiva or rabbinical school for Torah study, the study of Talmud, Rabbinic literature and Responsa. It is based in Wellbury House, Great Offley, near Hitchin in Hertfordshire. Previously Wellbury House had been a private school for Catholic boys aged 7 to 13.
Founded in about 1998, the yeshiva follows the Ashkenazi Orthodox ritual and is affiliated to the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations. The yeshiva has about 200 students on a site.
Following an unsatisfactory fire safety inspection in April 2002, that October the Charity Commission wrote to the Torath Chesed Yeshiva Trust, which runs the yeshiva, telling them not to re-open the school until vital building and safety improvement work had completed. Head of Investigations, David Rich, who visited the school, said,"To my layman's eyes it seemed like a death trap. Conditions were shocking. We saw very little in the way of fire safety equipment or fire safety instruction. We did see a broken glass panel in a door, cracked floor tiles just waiting for someone to trip on them, bare wires and emergency lights dangling precariously from the ceiling. I'm no expert but I wouldn't want to send my own kids there."
Safety hazards included the lack of fire escapes, insufficient fire-fighting equipment, the lack of emergency lighting and fire signage, the absence of staff training and any emergency plan.
The yeshiva subsequently reopened and is currently still operating.

Subdivisions of Zürich

The municipality of Zürich is divided into twelve districts (known as Kreis in German), numbered 1 to 12, each one of which may contain anywhere between 1 and 4 neighborhoods. There are a total of 34 neighborhoods. Zürich is also divided into 25 postal areas, roughly corresponding to small districts and neighborhoods of larger districts.
Two large expansions of the city limits occurred in 1893 and in 1934 when the city of Zürich merged with many surrounding municipalities, that had been growing increasingly together since the 19th century. Most of the district boundaries are fairly similar to the original boundaries of the previously existing municipalities before they were incorporated into the city of Zürich.
Each district has a "district office", which serves as an official registrar and provides various administrative functions. Larger neighborhoods also have their own "neighborhood office".
Politically, the significance of the districts has diminished, especially in elections where smaller districts have aligned with larger districts on some issues, forming between five and nine constituencies. School districts are no longer aligned with districts, as well as Civil Law notaries and church parishes.

Meteosat 8

Meteosat 8 is a weather satellite, also known as MSG 1. The Meteosat series are operated by EUMETSAT under the Meteosat Transition Programme (MTP) and the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) program. Notable for imaging the first meteor to be predicted to strike the earth, 2008 TC3. Launched 28 Aug 2002 by an Ariane V155, this European Meteorology satellite is in a Geostationary orbit.
While Meteosat 8 meteorological instruments are working OK, its solid state power amplifier SSPA-C failed in October 2002.
On 22 May 2007, the satellite experienced an unexpected orbit change. This was initially inappropriately assessed as being hit by an unknown object, but that was later assessed as not credible. The thermal protection was damaged at the same time as the orbit change. Subsequent investigation assessed the Meteosat-8 spinning spacecraft's orbit change due to the mass release of thermal covering whose attachment failed. Meteosat-8 is still performing a Rapid Scan Mission over Europe and is backup to the Met9 primary European Service.
In May 2012 Meteosat-8 switched to operating in an Earth Sensor Mode due to a problem with the sun sensor data on board. After modifying the ground image processing system the Rapid Scan Service image quality was restored back to nominal.

Phoenix City Square

Phoenix City Square is a mixed use complex with three “Class A” office towers and a hotel located in the midtown area of Phoenix, Arizona. The three office towers are numerically classified based upon their address on Central Avenue (see Central Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona ). They are referred to as the 3800 Tower, the 3838 Tower, and the 4000 Tower respectively. A Hilton Garden Inn is also part of the complex.
City Square was designed by the architectural firm, Flatow, Moore, Bryan, and Fairburn. The towers were constructed in 1962, 1964, and 1971. 3800 Tower is ; 3838 Tower is ;, and 4000 Tower is 295,797 square feet. There is also a large Fitness Center, known as Sports Club at City Square, that is part of the complex.
The past couple decades have seen a lot of activity around the City Square development. In 1996, the Singapore government went into escrow for the purchase of City Square. Before this the office complex was owned by “Phoenix City Square Partnership". At the time the Phoenix metropolitan area was experiencing drastic increases in commercial tenancy rates. In 2003, Hilton Hotels Corporation opened the redesigned Del Webb Townhouse Hotel as the Hilton Garden Inn. The hotel has 156 rooms and is seven stories. It is business oriented and contains of available meeting space. In 2005 the present owner, The Shidler Group, purchased the complex from Praedium Group. At the time, the construction of another tower was considered; however this never did materialize, which is a possible result of the real estate downturn. The Shidler Group maintains properties in Hawaii, California, and Arizona.
Phoenix City Square is on Central Avenue in Phoenix, Arizona. The Metro Light Rail track runs down this portion of Central Avenue. This project is part of the Valley Metro (Phoenix) system. On December 27, 2008, Valley Metro Light Rail officially opened. It remains to be seen if this will have an impact in increasing tenancy at City Square, though it will serve to connect the area to Downtown Phoenix. The City Square buildings have been criticized as being part of the “boring” architectural skyline in Central Phoenix.
In 2006, The Arizona Department of Economic Security signed a lease at City Square for a near 6-year tenancy. The deal was worth around $9.5 million and included approximately of office space. DES chose the 4000 Tower for its location. In 2007, a news release noted that the Arizona DES had extended their lease and increased office space to nearly 140,000 square feet.
There are a variety of businesses that are part of the complex. Besides having a fitness center, there are also cafes, a day care, a barber shop, law offices, accounting firms, engineering consultants, etc. There is also an on-site U.S. Bank as part of the City
Square area.
3800 is the smallest of the office towers in City Square, coming in under . Originally designed in the International Style, 3800 was updated in the early 1990s with cleaner lines, more architectural detail and given a pyramid crown. It contains an attached day care, and it is located directly on Central Avenue. 3800 Tower has a variety of businesses, such as Just Mortgage Inc., The Valley Forward Association, Law Offices of Michael Cordova, PMA Consultants, Black, Gould & Associates, Inc. and Maricopa County Legal Advocate.
3838, originally called the Greyhound Tower, is the middle-sized tower in Phoenix City Square. It is not directly on Central Avenue, but rather its location is on Clarendon Avenue. 3838 Tower is connected to a strip of cafes, and it also shares an outdoor plaza with 3800. This tower contains businesses like O’Connor & Campbell P.C., SouthWest Traffic Engineering LLC, SunCor Development Company, and Bar-S Foods Co.
4000 is the tallest tower in City Square, and has been noted on the List of tallest buildings in Phoenix, which lists 25 Skyscrapers in the city. Hilton Garden Inn shares the address with the 4000 Tower. Businesses inside 4000 Tower include Arizona Drug Screening & Investigations, First Community Financial Corporation, and Parsons & Goltry Law Firm. 4000 Tower is on the north side of Clarendon Avenue, whereas both 3800 and 3838 are on the southern side.

Solomon Islands national futsal team

The Solomon Islands national futsal team, nicknamed Kurukuru, represents the Solomon Islands in international futsal competitions. It is one of the strongest teams in Oceania, but fares poorly in competitions outside the region.
The team's coach in 2008 was Victor Wai'ia. By 2009, he had been succeeded by Dickson Kadau. The country has no futsal stadium, although in July 2009 Prime Minister Derek Sikua promised that the government would assist in building one.
On 7 October 2008, the Solomon Islands established a record for the worst defeat in the history of the Futsal World Cup, when it was beaten by Russia with two goals to thirty-one. It was the country's first participation in the World Cup; it finished last of group A, with four games lost out of four, 6 goals for and 69 against. At the 2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup, the Kurukuru also finished last of their group, suffering heavy defeats to Russia and Colombia, but did obtain their first World Cup win, beating Guatemala 4-3.
On a regional level, however, the Kurukuru won the 2008 Oceanian Futsal Championship, and successfully defended their title in 2009, beating Fiji 8–1 in the final, and then again in 2010. They are, therefore, the current regional champions.
The Solomon Islands national futsal team currently holds the world record for the fastest ever goal scored in an official futsal match. It was set by Kurukuru captain Elliot Ragomo, who scored against New Caledonia three seconds into the game in July 2009.

Trace (webtoon)

The Trace () is a South Korean webcomic series written and illustrated by manhwa artist Go Yeong-hun (고영훈) or known as his pen name, "Nasty Cat". Envy, jealousy, and selfishness, such dark sides of humans can be seen in the work. The artist said that he wants to create the world of heroes with Korean identity.
It won the first prize and Netizen's Choice Award at the 1st SICAF International Digital Cartoon Competition held in 2006. Mr. Go was awarded with ten million won. The panel stated that they easily reached to choose it as the grand prix because not only it scored the highest point in the netizens' recommended works but also it fully meets the required criteria; characteristics of web manhwa technique, and artistic features.
Since April 2007 this manhwa had been featured on Daum, one of major internet portals of South Korea that is being considered a birthplace of many hit webtoons.
Plot.
The story is set in contemporary South Korea. Some 30 years ago, unidentified creatures appeared out of nowhere and attacked mankind. They caused massive destruction wherever they went. The monsters are called "Troubles", and caused the world to fall into chaos. Along with the first appearance of the "Troubles", some number of humans were born with or acquired supernatural abilities. These mutants called "Traces" are the only ones who can fight off the Troubles. The Traces are also considered freaks and generally shunned by the community because some of them misused the powers for their own interest.
The plot revolves around two main characters. Sah Gang-kwon, a high school student born as a "Trace" who attempts to hide his ability. The other is Kim Yun-Seong, who acquired his "Trace" abilities during his early 30s. Soon after the acquisition, his wife and daughter were taken away from him for experimental purposes.
This arc shares about Ghang Gwon and Tae Eun's story. Ghang Gwon was taken in by Tae Eun's family as a child and hides the fact that he is a 'trace'. He doesn't sleep at night but instead, goes out hunting 'troubles' to protect Tae Eun and her father, which he regards as his family. An unexpected turn of events revealed his identity in school and Ghang Gwon was reported as a trace, being forced to leave them temporarily. It made him realise that it was not possible for him to live as a mere human being with his ability.
This arc revolves around the middle aged man, Kim Yun Seong. All he wanted was a peaceful life with his family, away from Traces and Troubles. When he realise he acquired his "trace" abilities, he tried to hide it but was discovered by the government and his family was taken away. He joins up with a group of other Traces to help him get into the facility where he believes his family is held.
This arc revolved to the story of Morrienoah Jin, a child which his ability is shot thing with his finger. He was being an assassin and worked with Morie. One day, a girl(Jang-mi) stood outside his house, made a dealt with Morrienoah Jin to protect her. When the deadline almost comes, Jin was fritter her away because scared about love. After realize he couldn't kept it, he became to love Jang-mi.
Main characters.
Sa Ghang Gwon is a Trace with the ability to manipulate ice. His powers had been with him since his birth, and because he could not control them, Ghang Gwon accidentally attacked his own parents. With no cure or solution to Traces, his parents abandoned him on a street next to an old beggar woman Trace who could conjure fire. He wandered around for an indeterminable amount of time, living his life as a scavenger and losing his emotions. He engaged in battle with his first Trouble, but after realizing he could not defeat it, he encased himself in ice until it disappeared. He passed out in a park, where he was found by Han Tae Eun. She took him home and asked her father if she could keep him. Afterward Tae Eun called Ghang Gwon her possession. Her family, consisting of only her and her father, adopted him, but Ghang Gwon, fearing that they would abandon him like his parents, hid from them his identity as a Trace. Over the years, he continued to battle Troubles, honing his skills. Whenever he is injured, though, he lets Tae Eun believe that he was bullied by his classmates.
When a Trouble attacks his class, Ghang Gwon attempts to come to the rescue, but Tae Eun stops him, knowing that if he fights the Trouble, his identity as a Trace will be revealed. She begs him not to get involved, but Ghang Gwon engages the Trouble and defeats it. Afterwards, he is taken by the government for three months, and then enrolled in a Trace school. His prime objective is to leave the Trace school and return to his family as soon as possible, and he believes that capturing the Beggar Team will grant him freedom.
Ghang Gwon is very quiet and almost antisocial. He hates that he is a Trace, shamefully hiding it from Han Tae Eun and her father; often, he mutters to himself that he is not a Trace. But he also specifically uses his powers to battle and destroy Troubles, so that his family can be safe. He is easily bullied and also submits to their beatings without complaint (for the sake of Han Tae Eun's safety), which only angers her. He has no facial expressions and seems to enjoy antagonizing her, calling her "battle addict" or "fighting chicken." He is extremely protective of her and her father, as his family. He seems to find Tae Eun especially precious. It is hinted that he likes her as more than a sister; while in the Trace academy, he repeatedly writes letters to her, ending each with the words "I miss you."
Hot-blooded and fiery, Han Tae Eun is well known in her school as a formidable fighter, more inclined to her fists than talking things through. She yells often, especially at Sa Ghang Gwon when he aggravates her. As a child her mother was killed by a rouge Trace in a park, and Tae Eun repeatedly visited the same spot her mother died, until she found a barely conscious Sa Ghang Gwon lying there. She took him home and adopted him as her possession. At some point in time, she discovered he was a Trace and labored to protect his identity, unbeknownst to him.
When Sa Ghang Gwon is taken away by the government, Han Tae Eun declares that she will become a Trace and be like him. She repeatedly battles Troubles at the expense of her own life, but then she awakens as a Trace. Her arms turn a sparkling red and shoot sparks, granting her inhuman strength and abilities. It seems that she needs to repeatedly punch hard objects like the ground to activate one of her arms, but if she strikes her fists together, the other arm will ignite.
Tae Eun is easily angered and irritable but also fiercely protective of Sa Ghang Gwon. She protects him specifically to prevent him from fighting back, so that he won't accidentally reveal his identity as a Trace. She seemed to resent that he was a Trace while she wasn't and accused Ghang Gwon of the same feelings, since he tried to hide his true identity from her. She's stubborn, believing that if she fought Troubles, she would become a Trace. After she becomes one, she goes about fighting Troubles, in the same way Ghang Gwon did (dressed with a face mask). Tae Eun seems to hold romantic feelings for Ghang Gwon, getting jealous when he carries Se Yeon and tells Tae Eun to run while escaping a Trouble.
Kim Yoon Seong was a man with a perfect life: a job, a loving wife, and a daughter. All this changes when one day he turns into a trace. Being a law-abiding citizen, he decides to legally register as a trace, rather than hide his identity. After that he is separated from his family who are taken to a trace facility where the family of the traces are taken. When he is not able to contact them he goes to the facility to see his family where he is stopped by a group of trace guards and chased where he meets Jeong Hee Sub who is also a trace trying to get into the facility. They join and form a team and recruit other members. They succeed in entering the facility where Kim Yun Seong finds the family of the traces who are brought there are used for experimental purposes and killed.
As a child, Jin was an emotionless trace who had ideals that 'The good should live, the bad should die', killing people who he deemed as bad. After coincidentally saving Morrie, he was raised by him to become a killer. He easily obtained the top title of Morrienoah that every killer wanted, being described as the perfect killer as he had no emotional weaknesses. This changed when he received a bizarre contract to protect a girl named Jang Mi (Rose) for a month from a killer. Rose gradually changed his life and Jin fell in love with her as the deadline drew closer. Jin managed to kill the killer after her life, yet, she committed suicide in front of him shortly after. Turns out that Rose was one of his victim's child and swore revenge by giving him love and make him lose it. Despite all that, she truly did love Jin. Jin was recruited into the 'Pierrot team' to infiltrate the facility much later in life.

Schomberg and Aurora Railway

The Schomberg and Aurora Railway (S&AR, also nicknamed the "Annie Roonie") was a 36 km long railway in Ontario, Canada, running from the town of Schomberg to Oak Ridges, just south of Aurora. It connected Schomberg to the Toronto and York Radial Railway (T&YRR) tram service running along Yonge Street, and from there into the Toronto city proper. The service ran for 25 years between 1902 and 1927; the rails were pulled up shortly thereafter.
History.
The S&AR started at the request of a Schomberg businessman who wanted to open the local produce markets to day-trippers from Toronto. The T&YRR had greatly increased visitors to similar markets in Newmarket (which is how it got its name) and they were hoping to do the same for Schomberg. The company was chartered in 1896, and construction started out from the Bond Lake area south of Aurora in July 1899.
The line was completed and opened for traffic in August 1902, an oddity that used steam trains to connect to the much smaller electrified trams. There were four stations in total, Aurora, Eversley Station on Dufferin Street, Kettleby Station at the corner of Kettleby Road and Weston Road, and Schomberg Station in the middle of Main Street in Schomberg. There were also numerous street side stops along the route, numbers 158 through 171. Because the railway operated on a small budget, it purchased extant buildings for its stations instead of constructing new ones.
There were four spurs, one to Mary Lake to serve a private line to the summer estates of Henry Pellatt and the Eatons (Eaton Hall), two smaller ones near Pottageville serving the Lloyd and Armstrong farms, and a small wye at Brillinger farm.
The S&AR operated independently for only two years before it was absorbed into the T&YRR family, part of William Mackenzie's railway empire. In 1916 the line was electrified and connected to the mainline on Yonge, allowing full interchange of cars. The line was never very busy, and as the T&YRR scaled back operations the S&AR was closed in 1927. Attempts by residents in Schomberg to reopen the line failed, and the rails were removed the next year.
Portions of the former right-of-way remain easily visible on aerial photos today, notably the portions closer to Schomberg. The final few hundred yards were incorporated into Dr. Kay Road in Schomberg, running between Main Street and the much newer Highway 27 to the east. Other portions have been incorporated in the nearby 19th Sideroad, Lloyd's Lane and Brule Trail, but development to the east of Highway 400 makes it more difficult to follow.
The Aurora station was converted into a restaurant before being demolished in the 1960s. The only S&AR building still in existence is a house in Schomberg that was once the terminus of the line.

Soviet Championship League

The Soviet Hockey Championship () was the highest level ice hockey league in the Soviet Union, running from 1946 to 1992. Before the 1940s the game of ice hockey was not cultivated in Russia, instead the more popular form of hockey was bandy, with history of the game in Russia dating several centuries into the past. Following the dissolution of the USSR, the league was temporarily renamed the CIS Championship in 1992. This organization was the direct predecessor of the "International Hockey League" (), and subsequent Russian Superleague (RSL) and current Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).
Teams.
The first cities to join the Soviet League were Moscow, Leningrad, Kaunas, Riga and Arkhangelsk. Far and away the most dominant club was HC CSKA Moscow, the famous "Red Army Team," which won 36 titles, including all but six from 1955 to 1989 and 13 in a row from 1976 to 1989. Indeed, Moscow teams won every title in the league's existence.

Its history goes back to "Spikkestad IF", which was founded in 1919. On 20 March 1963 it merged with neighboring club "Røyken IF", founded on 16 March 1932. Originally called "Røyken og Spikkestad IF", the name was soon decided to be "IL ROS".
Its men's football team currently resides in the Norwegian Fourth Division, the fifth tier. It played in the Third Division as late as in the 2007 season. Christer Basma started his career in the club.
In the fall of 2008 its women's football team started a collaboration with a neighbouring team, "Nærsnes og Åros IF", in order to maintain the opportunity for female players in both clubs to play football. Both teams were struggling with having enough players to form a full team. (Players from other clubs were also invited to join as many clubs in the area were struggling with the same problem). This collaboration has, so far, resulted in gathering enough young women to form a third division women's team AND a U19 team.

Donald Swain Lewis

Donald Swain Lewis, DSO (5 April 1886 – 10 April 1916) was a Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army and was the second highest-ranked officer in the Royal Flying Corps/Royal Air Force to be killed in action in the First World War. His father was Ernest Lewis, one of the founding directors of the Army & Navy Stores (United Kingdom).
On 14 September 1914 Major Geoffrey Salmond, CO of No.3 Sqdn and Captain Donald Swain Lewis carried out a successful experiment with a Royal artillery battery using a radio transmitter to communicate the fall of artillery shells. Lewis is also credited with creating the 
"grid square" map system which revolutionized British wartime cartography. This was probably not an Ordnance Survey style grid based on a system of mile or kilometre squaring, but a system based on squares identified by letters and numbers. In the Battle of the Aisne (September–October 1914), Lewis squared two copies of a 1:80,000 map, keeping one copy for himself for observing from the air, and giving a second copy to a battery commander with whom he was in wireless communication.
On 15 September the British Third Corps assigned its RFC squadrons to support the divisional heavy & howitzer batteries. The radio-equipped aeroplanes successfully supported the artillery in taking out German positions during the offensive on the Aisne.
In April 1915 Lewis was appointed to command No. 3 Squadron, operating on the Western Front. He returned to duties in Great Britain during the winter of 1915-16 before returning to France in February 1916 to take up command the Second Wing which was assigned to work with the Second Army in the Ypres Salient at that time.
On the 10 April 1916, flying a Moräne parasol, east of Wytschaete, with Captain A. W. Gale, an officer of the Trench Mortars, as observer, he was brought down by a direct hit from the enemy’s anti-aircraft guns. Gale was wounded.
Donald Swain Lewis married Margaret Agnes Maud Williams (1881-1942), daughter of Philip Williams, a retired Eton master, at St. Mark's, Farnborough, on 4 August 1914. They had no children. His widow later remarried.

The duration of the entire course is two years - equally divided between course work and writing dissertation. The first year of course work is further divided into two halves. The first half deals with the core courses, which all the students have to go through, and the second deals with the specialization courses distinguished by a few select disciplines. On completion of the first semester of course work, each student is to specialize in one of the following disciplinary areas: literature and cultural studies, economics, sociology, history and political science. The specialization courses, irrespective of the disciplinary area, will have a strong emphasis on development-oriented topics. This part of the course work will help the students identify topics for dissertation. By the end of the first year, students will choose their dissertation topics and start working under the close supervision of the faculty.

<doc id="19676867" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19676867" title="Irrelevant speech effect">
Irrelevant speech effect

The irrelevant speech effect refers to the degradation of serial recall when speech sounds are presented, even if the list items are presented visually. The sounds need not be a language the participant understands, nor even a real language - human speech sounds are sufficient to produce this effect.
Interference hypothesis.
It is possible that the visual stimuli (the list of items) is held in working memory as a phonological code. The phonological loop is composed of the articulatory rehearsal loop and the phonological store. If that is the case, the irrelevant speech could interfere with the articulatory rehearsal process, degrading the information in the phonological store. This would result in degraded performance on trials where irrelevant speech is presented. However, the effect should be greater for words rehearsed longer (i.e. presented earlier in the series) since they are rehearsed more often, hence having more opportunity for degradation.

Basic Utility Vehicle

Basic Utility Vehicle (BUV) is a simple rugged vehicle designed for use in the developing world. The Institute for Affordable Transportation (IAT) is the promoter of this type of vehicle and the main sponsor. IAT runs the annual BUV Design Competition where engineering students bring their vehicles for judging and performance evaluation (including cost) and contribute to IAT’s research and development efforts. The competition harnesses the creative energy of college students from across the United States in an effort to develop a simple, low-cost utility vehicle that can benefit low-income people in rural areas of developing countries. 
Student teams design and build these vehicles to compete in a series of tests and events to determine the best design. Each team also plans an oral report aimed towards the judges and spectators. In the reports, students discuss the planning, building, and testing processes that each BUV went through prior to the competition. Because the BUV must account for a lack of infrastructure, the vehicles must pass a variety of tests during the competition including an obstacle course, mud pit, mogul field, and endurance track. Many of the students work on the BUV as a senior capstone project at the end of their engineering degree.
BUVs are designed around these specifications:

The Arrest of Lieutenant Golightly

The Arrest of Lieutenant Golightly is a short story by Rudyard Kipling. It was first published in the "Civil and Military Gazette" on November 23 1886, in book form in the first Indian edition of "Plain Tales from the Hills" in 1888, and in subsequent editions of that collection. The story, published when Kipling was not quite 21 years old, is a well-crafted piece of writing about an essentially schoolboy version of "schadenfreude" - sheer pleasure, in this case, at seeing someone 'get his comeuppance' - with an element of slapstick.
Lieutenant Golightly is a young officer in the British Army in India who prides himself on "looking like 'an Officer and a Gentleman'". According to John McGivering, in the Notes to this story on the Kipling Society's website (), Golightly is certainly an officer, but not at all certainly a gentleman. It is clear that he takes too much care over his appearance, and dresses rather too flashily, wearing, as he is, a "delicate olive-green suit" with a blue tie and a sola topee. As he hastens back from leave (having left all his money apart from loose change behind him), he is beset by misfortune: monsoon rains make him muddy and sweaty; his helmet dissolves in the rain; the dyes of its lining (purple) and his suit (green) run. He falls from his horse, which becomes so lame that he has to walk, whereon he throws away his tie, which has also run, and his (detachable) collar. He arrives at a railway station, buys a drink - and finds that he only has 6 Indian anna left. On talking to the Station Master, he is taken for a deserter, one Private Binkle, and after some temporising is arrested and carried bodily off by four native policeman. They hand him over to a detachment of the British Army, who admire his fluency in bad language, but don't believe his insistence that he is an officer. Golightly is finally saved by a Major in his own Regiment, who recognises him and has him released - then, of course, relating the story to the army. Kipling says that he may now publish the story as Golightly has "gone Home".

The B.O. Cutter House is a house in the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1856 by master carpenter B.O. Cutter, who was working on other buildings around the University of Minnesota. He built this house on the outskirts of the campus at the time. The house was built in the Carpenter Gothic style with hand-carved molding around the eaves. In 1869, he sold the house to John Gilfillan, who was an educator, regent of the University of Minnesota, banker, attorney, and a U.S. representative in the 49th United States Congress.
The house was remodeled in 1943, at which point it was covered in stucco. The interior was remodeled in 1949 to accommodate the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. It was heavily damaged in a 1992 fire, but was restored. It now houses the local chapter of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Ruard Manor

The Bucelleni-Ruard Manor, commonly referred to as the Ruard manor (), is a 16th-century manor house located in the Sava district of the town of Jesenice, Slovenia, at the street address of "45 Prešernova". It is one of four so-called "ironworks castles" built in the area during the 16th and early 17th centuries by the owners of iron-mining and -processing facilities, in what were then the clustered settlements of Plavž, Sava, Murova and Javornik, amalgamated into the town of Jesenice in 1929. The Kos Manor in Murova also survives; the Plavž and Javornik manors were demolished.
The Ruard Manor was built in 1538 by the Italian businessman Bernardo Bucelleni, who had recently relocated to Sava from Bergamo and whose family would come to dominate the iron mining and processing industry of the entire upper Sava valley. Unlike the Kos manor, Bucelenni chose to locate this residence close to the ironworks themselves. The Bucellenis were very successful for a time, and were ennobled during the 17th century, taking the name "von Reichenberg" after the German name of their ore mines at Savske Jame. In 1686 the family was elevated to counthoood.
The manor gained the second half of its current name in 1766, when Valentin Ruard, a Belgian entrepreneur, bought the entire estate and restored the failing ironworks surrounding it. Leopold Ruard, his son, was mayor of Jesenice under the brief period of French rule. In 1831, the manor was expanded and reconstructed in the Neoclassical style. In the next generation, it passed out of Ruard hands, as Viktor Ruard was unable to obtain capital for the modernization of the family ironworks, and was forced to sell both them and the manor to the KID company in 1871, which converted it into clerks' housing (much like the nearby Kasarna).
Since 1954, the manor has served as a museum, and later became the seat of the Upper Sava Museum. It hosts several permanent exhibits:

Background.
In the 1968 presidential election, Alabama supported native son and American Independent Party candidate George Wallace over both Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. Wallace was the official Democratic candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was listed as the "National Democratic". In 1976, Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.
Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and comprised a longstanding majority in the Alabama Legislature.

CEFIC

The European Chemical Industry Council or Cefic (from its former French name "Conseil Européen des Fédérations de l'Industrie Chimique") is the main European trade association for the chemical industry. It was founded in 1959, and its history follows through the creation of the European Union. Its headquarters are located in Brussels. Cefic represents 29,000 large, medium and small chemical companies in Europe, interacting on behalf of their members with international and EU institutions, non-governmental organisations, the international media, and other stakeholders. Chemicals companies in the European Union employ a total staff of about 1.2 million.
History.
The association was founded in 1959 under the name ""Secrétariat International des Groupements Professionnels des Industries Chimiques des Pays de la CEE (S.I.I.C)"". Two years later, the "Conseil Européen des Fédérations de l'Industrie Chimique (Cefic)" was created. In parallel, the chemical industry associations of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries also started to organise. The two organisations merged in 1972 under the Cefic name to better represent the interests of the chemical industry at international level.
In 1990, the association changed its name to "European Chemical Industry Council" to reflect the integration of the chemical companies. The Cefic acronym was nevertheless retained.
Since 2012, the president of Cefic has been Kurt Bock, from BASF.
About Cefic.
Cefic represent the entire range of chemicals production.
Cefic governance is ensured by the Board and Executive Committee, elected every two years by the General Assembly, composed of all Cefic members - companies and national associations. 
The operational management of Cefic is ensured by the National Associations Board (NAB), the Industry Sector Board (ISB)and the Leadership Team.
Cefic comprises: 
- six horizontal programmes
- four industry sectors
- one service unit (finance and administration)
- one International Chemicals Management unit.
Cefic activities also include the provision of advice and services to our industry - corporations and SMES (see Responsible Care) - and beyond, to the whole value chain of customers, retailers and transporters.
Cefic is an active member of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) which represents chemical manufacturers and producers all over the world and seeks to strengthen existing cooperation with global organisations such as UNEP and the OECD to improve chemicals management worldwide.
Cefic Membership.
Cefic is composed of all Cefic member companies and national Associations.
Cefic has 3 distinct groups of members: Corporate (ACOM) - Federation (AFEM) and Business (ABM) and 3 types of partnerships: Associated Companies, Affiliated Associations and partners.
About the European Chemical Industry.
As one of the largest and most diversified industries globally, the European chemical industry supplies virtually all sectors of the economy, providing innovative and sustainable solutions to today’s economic and environmental challenges. It plays a vital role in providing all manufacturing sectors, as well as the construction, health and agricultural sectors, with essential products and services. It has created wealth and employment for millions of European citizens over the years. In the European Union (EU), it is the leading manufacturing sector in terms of value added per employee.
As a key partner to the EU institutions, the European chemical industry strongly supports and implements the Europe 2020 targets. The industry is facilitating an economy based on knowledge and innovation to achieve smart growth, promoting more resource-efficient processes to achieve sustainable growth, and encouraging a high-employment economy throughout the value-chain to achieve inclusive growth.
The European chemical industry is more than a supplier of products, it is a provider of worldwide sustainable solutions. Examples include efficiencies made through recycling and water management processes, breakthroughs in materials created for sustainable building and transport, and developments in areas such as nanotechnology, advanced materials and biotechnology. The industry is benefiting from its historic advantages of innovation, long-standing customer relationships, an efficient network of SMEs and large companies and a highly skilled workforce.

Radožda

Radožda () is a village in the Struga municipality in the southwestern region of the Republic of Macedonia.
Geography.
Radožda is situated on the western shore of the Ohrid Lake. It is south of the town Struga. It is from the Macedonian-Albanian border crossing Ćafa San. The closest village is the village of Lin which is situated in Albania. The village is situated at above sea level.
History.
The village was founded on the western edge of the Ohrid Lake over ten centuries ago. It was founded in a fertile area which soon became accustomed to farming. The surrounding hinterland was suitable for small-scale agriculture and the area was settled. The village was founded approximately west of today's position.
Etymology.
A document from the era of Tsar Stefan Dušan has the village listed under the name "Radobužda" (). An Ottoman document from the year 1583 also records the village but under a different name "Radohožda" () while a hand written document from the Serbian Branislav Nušić has the village listed as "Radooždž" () while Austrian-Hungarian maps have the village listed as "Radoliožda", () or "Radohožda" ().
Saint Archangel Michael.
The Church Saint Archangel Michael was built in the Jablanica mountain range above the village of Radožda in the 13th century. It was built in a natural cave and was dedicated to the military commander of the Bodiless Army - the Archangel Michael. Most of the frescoes date from the 14th century with one preserved from the 13th century. The cave church was repainted in the 14th thus removing many of the old frescoes. The top layer of painting in the church was the last accomplishment of the Ohrid Fine Art School from the 14th century.
Demography.
The 2002 census counted 808 people present in the village. Many of these residents were elderly as much of the current generation have left the village due to work and other reasons. The village is populated by ethnic Macedonians.
Village festivals.
The Village does not have any long standing traditions but there are some traditions specific to the village.
For Easter the villagers gather and go to all of Radožda's seven churches, the women trade dyed eggs, the villages light candles and they pray to god.
On 2 August the village celebrates Ilinden. The villages gather at the St Ilija Church and they trade holy bread, holy water while the villagers celebrate the glorious day. The whole village turns out to celebrate the event.
For the feast of the Assumption of Mary on 28 August the whole village waits for guests from all over the Struga and Ohrid areas. This is the biggest holy day in Radožda.

National Collegiate Roller Hockey Championships

The annual National Collegiate Roller Hockey Championships, formerly the Collegiate Roller Hockey National Championships, tournament determines the top inline hockey team in NCRHA Division I, Division II, Junior College Division and B Division.
The NCRHA Division I National Collegiate Roller Hockey Championship is a round-robin followed by a single elimination competition that has determined the collegiate national champion since the inaugural 2004 NCRHA Division I Collegiate Roller Hockey National Championships. The tournament features 24 teams representing all seven Division I member organizations in the nation. The Selection Committee seeds the entire field from 1 to 24 within six pools of 4 teams. The winners of the seven Division I regional championships receive automatic bids to participate in the NCRHA National Championships. The tournament begins with initial pool play at a single site.
In setting up the tournament, the Selection Committee seeks to ensure "competitive equity." Teams seeded No. 1 through No. 4 are placed in "Pool A", No. 5 through No. 8 are placed in "Pool B", etc. After round-robin competition, all teams are seed based on pool the by pool ranking, where No. 1 team in "Pool A" will be seeded #1 in the single-elimination bracket. No. 2 team in "Pool A" will be seeded #2, and No. 3 team in "Pool A" seeded #3, etc. Regional matchups are avoided in the pool play; should seven or more teams from one region make the tournament, this guideline may be disregarded in favor of preserving the tournament's integrity.

Powder monkey

A powder boy or powder monkey manned naval artillery guns as a member of a warship's crew, primarily during the Age of Sail. His chief role was to ferry gunpowder from the powder magazine in the ship's hold to the artillery pieces, either in bulk or as cartridges. The function was fulfilled by boy seamen 12 to 14 years of age. Powder monkeys were usually boys or young teens selected for the job for their speed and height — they were short and would be hidden behind the ship's gunwale, keeping them from being shot by enemy ships' sharp shooters. In recent times the term has been applied to a variety of workers who deploy explosives. The use of the term 'powder monkey' in English dates to the late 17th century.

Modelville 2.
Original Airdate: October 21, 2008 
The girls move into their apartment which is the same Flathotel suite the Cycle 1 girls stayed in America's Next Top Model, Cycle 1. Fatima and Lauren joke around about their old rivalry they had with each other on their cycle of Top Model. Fatima then leaves for a photo shoot with CosmoGirl. Later Renee, Bianca and Dominique go in town to shop for boots, but Renee, worried about her timing and feeling ill gets back to the apartment in time. Dominique and Bianca end up being 3 hours late to a surprise yet scheduled meeting with Tyra, upsetting the producers. After that, Dominique breaks down and fights with Bianca who doesn't understand her way of dealing with her feelings.
Later Renee reveals she was physically and mentally abused by her father, prompting Lauren to reveal that she has been raped by her grandfather. Bianca, confused about this, starts asking why their mothers "didn't do anything" upsetting Renee who leaves the room shouting at Bianca that she doesn't know what she is talking about. Throughout the program Tyra interviews the girls, as well as Renee's mother after the Bianca and Renee fight segment.
After a visit from the founder of Carol's Daughter, Lisa Price assigns the girls their products and they begin to research for their commercials in various ways.
Lauren and Dominique test their products out, Fatima visits the Carol's Daughter flagship store in Harlem, while Bianca hits the web, and Renee goes straight to a conference held by Lisa Price. They later rehearse in front of the camera, with more or less success.

Modelville 3.
Original Airdate: November 5, 2008 
The girls have a party with their friends which gets out of control when Lauren's friends are told that the bathroom is off-limits. They begin to trash the suite until Dominique states the party is over and the girls get everybody out and are left to clean.
The girls enjoy some downtime but Renee struggles with her husband's fear that she will leave him if she wins and Bianca meets with Camille, whom she thinks is using her, but they work their issues out. The girls are then sent to an industry party where Renee uses her networking skills while Fatima and Dominique struggle to make a good impression. Bianca, dealing with her family's response over her coming forward about the airport incident in episode 1 decides to spend the party in the car.
Renee and Dominique then go to Clear Talents to have a meeting with agents about modeling and maybe more. Lauren refuses to accompany them, not knowing whether her passion is modeling or drawing. They both receive positive feedback but Dominique is told she has to move to NYC to pursue modeling and realize that her finances just don't match. Renee's husband is on the show and Renee states that she thinks he'd be ready to move with her if she won.
The girls are then given a challenge to sell a cup in 3 minutes and are then judged by one another. Renee is praised by her roommates, while Dominique is told that her facial expressions are distracting by a tough Fatima. Both Bianca and Fatima didn't understand the 3 minutes time frame and Lauren just didn't participate.

Vicente Soriano

Vicente Soriano Serra (born 1953 in Puçol, Valencian Community, Spain) is a Valencian businessman. He became President and majority shareholder of Valencia CF in 2008, after reaching an agreement with Juan Soler to take over the presidency of the club and purchase Juan Soler's shares to the value of 70.7 million euros. After an ill-fated attempt to resolve the club's debts, he was finally succeeded by Manuel Llorente.
Biography.
Having started out in the orange export business, in the 1990s he got involved in construction as a real estate broker, and subsequently as a property developer and representative of large investor groups.
He entered the world of soccer in 2004 when forming part of Paco Roig's "Cor i Força", the team that was running against then ousted president Jaume Ortí. Juan Soler won the election and Soriano accepted the role offered of vicepresident.
Soriano was charged with the selection of plans for the new stadium (see Nou Mestalla). Finally Soler rejected said projects. As a result, his relations with the then-president deteriorated. He was relieved of the vice-presidency in January 2006, although never he sold his allocation of shares. He resigned from the board in June 2007. He threatened to return to the club accompanied by Juan Villalonga to get a hold of Soler's stock, a situation that did not bear fruit. Villalonga briefly took over the running of the club in 2008, but when he proposed to buy the 37% held by Soler, Soriano reconciled with the majority shareholder and reached an agreement for the buying and selling of the Soler family shares in an amount set at 70.7 million euros, which was overturned after Soriano failed to sell the old Mestalla ground by the end of the year, finally resigning on 4 June 2009 because he had still failed to sell it. An attempt to raise capital by improving income from television rights also failed. 
However, following an absence of just one month, during which time Manuel Llorente took over, Soriano returned in July, having gained 51% of the shares and linked up with a mysterious company called Inversiones Dalport, an investment company supposedly from Uruguay but with an office in Madrid. Soriano announced that none of the star players such as David Villa, Juan Manuel Mata or David Silva would now need to be sold, as all the debts would be wiped clean. 
However, failure to find any information on Dalport on the Internet prior to the announcement prompted an outcry at the press conference. The media's suspicions were further heightened when fans noticed that the logo of an eagle used by Dalport had in fact been copied from a children's colouring-in book. Prematurely ousted president Llorente echoed the fans' suspicions Like 70% of fans, Llorente does not believe that Soriano will deliver, and warned that Valencia is opening themselves up to a potential investment scam.
When, as predicted, Dalport failed to deliver, on August 21, 2009 Fundació VCF took over, becoming the main shareholder with 72.5% of shares, using a loan from Bancaixa and guaranteed by the local government. The Fundació is not allowed to end up with less than 51%, thereby ensuring stability within Valencia CF and cementing Manuel Llorente as the bona fide president.

Vicente Guaita

Vicente Guaita Panadero (born 10 January 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Valencia CF as a goalkeeper.
Football career.
Born in Torrent, Valencian Community, Guaita was a Valencia CF youth system graduate, being promoted to the first team for the 2008–09 season following the retirement of historical Santiago Cañizares. Additionally, as German Timo Hildebrand became ostracized by coach Unai Emery, he became the backup.
Guaita made his official debut with the main squad on 2 October 2008, in a UEFA Cup tie against C.S. Marítimo (2–1 home win). However, after the signing of veteran César Sánchez from Tottenham Hotspur later in the year and the full recovery of Renan, he remained third-choice until the end of the campaign.
In 2009–10, with Sánchez having renewed his link a further year and the signing of RCD Mallorca's Miguel Ángel Moyà, Guaita was deemed surplus to requirements and joined, on loan, second division's Recreativo de Huelva. As the Andalusians finished comfortably in mid-table he was crowned the competition's Ricardo Zamora Trophy, with just 24 goals conceded in 30 appearances.
In November–December 2010, profiting from injuries to both César and Moyà, Guaita had a run of several matches for Valencia, notably a 2–1 home win against UD Almería in La Liga and a 1–1 draw at Manchester United for the season's UEFA Champions League. On 2 April 2011, as he had established himself in the starting XI, he suffered the loss of his father due to a heart attack (aged only 46), prompting manager Unai Emery to reinstate César between the posts for two games.
In late May 2011, Guaita extended his contract with Valencia until 2015. He begun the season as the starter, but picked up a serious hand injury in early November 2011, being nonetheless selected to several games by Emery as the reserve.

Chișinău Water Tower

The Chișinău Water Tower is an architectural monument of Chișinău, Moldova, located at 2 Mitropolit Bănulescu-Bodoni Street and built at the end of 19th century after a project by Alexander Bernadazzi. It was a main part of Chişinău's water system. The upper level was built of wood and was destroyed by an earthquake. It was rebuilt between 1980 and 1983.
Structure.
The tower's height is 22 m. The walls are built of local rock, with some rows of brick. Their width varies from 60 cm at the upper level to 2 m at the bottom. Inside there is a spiral staircase. When the tower was renovated, an elevator was installed. For a short while, the History Museum of Chișinău had its headquarters in this building.
A similar tower was built at the crossing of Vasile Alecsandri and Veronica Micle streets, but it does not exist anymore.

<doc id="19677967" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19677967" title="Slip forming">
Slip forming

Slip forming, continuous poured, continuously formed, or slipform construction is a construction method in which concrete is poured into a continuously moving form. Slip forming is used for tall structures (such as bridges, towers, buildings, and dams), as well as horizontal structures, such as roadways. Slipforming enables continuous, non-interrupted, cast-in-place "flawless" (i.e. no joints) concrete structures which have superior performance characteristics to piecewise construction using discrete form elements. Slip forming relies on the quick-setting properties of concrete, and requires a balance between quick-setting capacity and workability. Concrete needs to be workable enough to be placed into the form and consolidated (via vibration), yet quick-setting enough to emerge from the form with strength. This strength is needed because the freshly set concrete must not only permit the form to "slip" upwards but also support the freshly poured concrete above it. 
In vertical slip forming the concrete form may be surrounded by a platform on which workers stand, placing steel reinforcing rods into the concrete and ensuring a smooth pour. Together, the concrete form and working platform are raised by means of hydraulic jacks. Generally, the slipform rises at a rate which permits the concrete to harden by the time it emerges from the bottom of the form. 
In horizontal slip forming for pavement and traffic separation walls concrete is laid down, vibrated, worked, and settled in place while the form itself slowly moves ahead. This method was initially devised and utilized in Interstate Highway construction initiated by the Eisenhower administration during the 1950s.
History.
The slip forming technique was in use by the early 20th century for building silos and grain elevators. James MacDonald, of MacDonald Engineering of Chicago was the pioneer in utilizing slip form concrete for construction. His concept of placing circular bins in clusters was patented, with photographs and illustrations, contained in a 1907 book, “The Design Of Walls, Bins, And Grain Elevators”.
In 1910, MacDonald published a paper “Moving Forms for Reinforced Concrete Storage Bins,” describing the use of molds for moving forms, using jacks and concrete to form a continuous structure without joints or seams. This paper details the concept and procedure for creating slip form concrete structures. On May 24, 1917, a patent was issued to James MacDonald of Chicago, "for a device to move and elevate a concrete form in a vertical plane". 
James MacDonald’s bin and silo design was utilized around the world into the late 1970s by MacDonald Engineering. In the 1947-1950 period, MacDonald Engineering constructed over 40 concrete towers using the slip-form method for AT&T Long Lines up to 191 ft tall for microwave relay stations across the United States. 
The former LandMark Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas was constructed in 1961 by MacDonald Engineering as a subcontractor, utilizing MacDonald’s concept of slip form concrete construction to build the 31 story reinforced steel tower. 
The technique was introduced to residential and commercial buildings in the late 1960s. One of Its first uses in high-rise buildings the United States was on the shear wall supported apartment building at Turk & Eddy Streets in San Francisco, CA, in 1962, built by the San Francisco office of MacDonald Engineering. The first notable use of the method in a residential/retail business was the Skylon Tower in Niagara Falls, Ontario, which was completed in 1965. Another unusual structure was the tapered buttress structures for the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1969. Another shear wall supported structure was the Casa Del Mar Condominium on Key Biscayne, Miami, FL in 1970. 
From the 1960s, the vertical technique was adapted to mining head frames, ventilation structures, below grade shaft lining, and coal train loading silos; theme and communication tower construction; high rise office building cores; shear wall supported apartment buildings; tapered stacks and hydro intake structures, etc. It is used for structures which would otherwise not be possible, such as the separate legs of the Troll A deep sea oil drilling platform which stands on the sea floor in water about 1000 feet (300 m) deep, has an overall height of 472 meters (1,549 ft), weighs 656,000 tons, and has the distinction of being the tallest structure ever moved (towed) by mankind.
In addition to the typical silos and shear walls and cores in buildings, the system is used for lining underground shafts and surge tanks in hydroelectric generating facilities. The technique was utilized to build the Inco Superstack in Sudbury, Ontario, and the CN Tower in Toronto. In 2010, the technique was used to build the core of the supertall Shard London Bridge tower in London, England.

Bergmeister's papilla

Bergmeister’s papilla arises from the centre of the optic disc, consists of a small tuft of fibrous tissue and represents a remnant of the hyaloid artery.
The hyaloid artery provides nutrition to the lens during development in the fetus, and runs forward to the lens from the optic disc. The optic disc is covered by a plaque of fibrous cells called the central supporting tissue meniscus of Kuhnt. This plaque forms a fibrous sheath around the hyaloid artery where it leaves the optic disc. 
At birth the hyaloid artery regresses, and is normally completely regressed by the time of eyelid opening. Bergmeister’s papilla is a remnant of the hyaloid artery fibrous sheath and is frequently observed as an incidental clinical finding.
Bergmeister’s papilla is named after Austrian ophthalmologist O. Bergmeister (1845–1918).

Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant

The Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant is a proposed nuclear power plant, which may be built on the Bell Bend of the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station. 
On October 10, 2008, PPL Bell Bend, LLC submitted a combined construction permit and operating license application (COLA) for the plant with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) — in time for the potential plant to qualify for production tax credits under the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005.
NRC review of the 10,000-page COLA is expected to follow this schedule<br>Phase A - Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) Issued to Applicant already on 3/20/2011. <br>
Phase B - Advanced Final Safety Evaluation Report (SER) without 
Open Items by 3/2012<br>
Phase C - ACRS Review of Advanced Final SER by 6/2012<br>
Phase D - Final SER by 8/2012
The proposed nuclear power plant consists of one European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) steam electric system designed by the French company AREVA. The rated core thermal power will be 4,590 MWt. The rated and design net electrical output is approximately 1,600 MWe. Plants using this technology now are under construction in Finland, France, and China.
The plant would be built by PPL and UniStar Nuclear Energy, a joint enterprise of Constellation Energy and French energy giant EDF.
PPL spokesman Dan McCarthy said in 2008 that the plant would cost about $10 billion to develop, and seven to eight years to construct — beginning operation in 2016 or 2017.
A 2011 estimate gave costs as $13–15 billion and an operational starting date of 2018-20. 
PPL filed an initial application for federal loan guarantees by the September 29, 2008 deadline. 
PPL intends to submit the second part of the application by the December 19 deadline. 
PPL Chief Operating Officer William Spence said, "Without federal loan guarantees, companies like PPL will not be able to secure financing for the substantial cost of building new, advanced-design nuclear energy plants that will help this country achieve challenging limits on carbon dioxide emissions, as well as energy independence".

<doc id="19678111" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19678111" title="Ultimate attribution error">
Ultimate attribution error

The "ultimate attribution error" is a group level attribution error that offers an explanation for how one person views different causes of negative and positive behavior in ingroup and outgroup members. 
The ultimate attribution error arises as a way to explain an outgroup’s negative behaviour as flaws in their personality, and to explain an outgroup's positive behaviour as a result of chance or circumstance. It is also the belief that positive acts performed by ingroup members are as a result of their personality, whereas if an ingroup member behaves negatively (this is believed to be rare), it is a result of situational factors. 
Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error differs from the fundamental attribution error. While similar, the ultimate attribution error describes how prejudiced individuals rationalize their intergroup perceptions. The fundamental attribution error describes an overemphasis of internal explanations for behaviors in others, without taking into account the external factors that may influence behavior.
Overview.
The ultimate attribution error was first established by Thomas F. Pettigrew, in his 1979 publication, "The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport’s Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice". As the title suggests, the ultimate attribution error is a theoretical extension of Gordon Allport's work in attribution theory.
The ultimate attribution error is a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped in part by one’s prejudices. Prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute dispositional, internal, (possibly genetically determined), causes to an outgroup member’s negative behaviors. These same prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute (a) "exceptional case", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) highly motivated, or (d) situational context causes for their positive behaviors. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behavior to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes.
In general, anyone may commit the ultimate attribution error, however, it is most likely to happen to individuals who possess negative prejudices and stereotypes toward an outgroup. This attribution is considered a root of prejudice as people who commit this attribution will usually see members of other races, religions, cultures, or even social class an as dispositionally inferior or flawed. While people from their own racial, cultural, or religious ingroup, upon committing the same negative behaviors, are good people who are dealing with specific situations the best they can. This reduces the acceptance of outgroup members as any positive behavior are downplayed while negative behaviors are highlighted.
Explaining away positive behavior of outgroup members.
The attribution of outgroup member’s positive behavior is classically categorized into four categories created at the intersection of perceived degree of controllability of act (low, high), and perceived locus of control of act (internal, external). "Please refer to image for visual representation of the four categories."
The exceptional case explanation is created at the intersection of low controllability of act and internal locus of control. Using this mode of reasoning, an individual excludes this particular outgroup member from their group. That is, they individuate the outgroup member, and disassociate this particular outgroup member from that group. 
This view allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs through categorizing that exceptional case as “good” unlike all the other “bad” members of their group.
The luck or special advantage explanation is created at the intersection of low-perceived controllability of act and external locus of control. This reasoning suggest that the outgroup member’s positive behavior is not rooted in their skill, ability, or hard work. Rather, their positive outcome is beyond their immediate control and therefore of little significance. Special advantage extends this by suggesting that the their group affiliation offers some advantage and therefore the positive outcome is of little significance.
The highly motivated explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and internal locus of control. Similar to the exceptional case, the highly motivated explanation individuates the outgroup member and dissociates them from their group. The outgroup member’s positive behavior is rooted in their drive to be seen as anti-stereotypic, an external force. Thus, they are not seen as intrinsically exceptional, but externally motivated, and, without this motivation, they would not be able to achieve success. That is, an outgroup member’s positive behavior is evidence of their response to external pressures of their interaction with ingroup other. Therefore, without an external source of motivation, the outgroup member is just like any other low achieving, negative behavior outgroup member.
Similar to the exceptional case, this explanation allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs. That is, the highly motivated outgroup member is seen as hard working, so there must be something wrong with the rest of them.
The situational explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and external control of the act. An outgroup member’s positive outcome is not rooted in their effort or ability, but a result of external situational factors that are, at least in some part, influenced by others. Therefore their positive behavior is not their own, and is of little consequence.
Evidence.
The ultimate attribution error is evidenced in a number of studies:
• Taylor and Jaggi (1974) found results supporting the ultimate attribution error in the causal attributions between religious ingroup and outgroup members.
In a 2x2 between-group design Hindi or Muslim participants were asked to make casual attributions for undesirable acts performed by Hindis or Muslim. Hindis attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Hindis, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Muslims. Conversely, Muslims attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Muslims, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Hindis. While Pettigrew and many other to follow would focus on race, this study offered clear insight that similar mechanisms are play in religious groups.
• Prior to Pettigrew’s formalization of the ultimate attribution error, Birt Duncan found that White participants viewed Black individuals as more violent that White individuals in an “ambiguous shove” situation, where a Black or White person accidentally shoves a White person.
In a 2x2 between-group design, White participants viewed a Black or White individual (Harm-doer) ambiguously shoving a Black or White individual (victim) . In general, when a Black harm-doers shoved another person, Black or White, their behavior was attributed their high dispositional levels of violence (internal) than White harm-doers. In general, when a White harm-doer shoved another person, Black or White, their behavior was attributed to external constraints. The results suggest that these White students possess a lower threshold for labeling a behavior violent when the harm-doer is Black (outgroup) than when the harm-doer is White (ingroup).
• Morris and Peng (1994) find support for Pettigrew’s ultimate attribution error in a comparison of casual attributions made by ingroup and outgroup members about a murder carried out by an ingroup or outgroup assailant.
In a 2x2 between-group design, American or Chinese participants learned about a recent murder committed by an American or Chinese individual. They received the media coverage for the murder and were asked to weight the dispositional and situational explanations for the cause of the number. As the ultimate attribution error predicts, American participants were biased toward dispositional explanations for the Chinese murder suspect, and biased toward situational explanations for the American murder suspect. In addition, the Chinese participants were attributed dispositional causes for the American murder suspect and situational causes for the Chinese murder suspect.
Together, these three studies establish the foundation and support the general prediction of the ultimate attribution error, negative behaviors by outgroup members are more likely to be attributed to internal causes than negative behaviors of ingroup members. Many other studies have been published using the ultimate attribution error as a theoretical foundation.
• Supporting this general statement, a meta-analysis of 19 ultimate attribution error studies was published in 1990. His meta-analysis offers limited support for Pettigrew’s ultimate attribution error. Specifically, he finds support for three aspects of the ultimate attribution error:

Castle of Campo Maior

The Castle of Campo Maior () is a medieval military fortification, in the civil parish of São João Bapista, municipality of Campo Maior, part of a first line of defense in the Portuguese Alentejo, oriented towards Spain, in conjunction with the military forts of Ouguela, Elvas, Olivença and Juromenha. It is a walled bulwark of the modern era, highlighted by a Renaissance-era window in the northern tower of the castle. It has been listed as a National monument since 1911.
History.
Owing the regions occupation by successive tribes of Celts, Romans and Muslims, it is likely that the territory of Campo Maior has been settled during the pre-historic epochs. The land of Campo Maior was definitively conquered from the Moors by the forces of Kingdom of León in 1230. The first foral ("charter") was issued by the Bishop of Badajoz thirty years after this event.
Eventually, the castle was conquered by the Portuguese in 1295-1296, and integrated into the national territory in 1297, under the Treaty of Alcanizes. In order to maintain the peace between Spain and Portugal, King Denis ordered the reconstruction of the fortress in 1310, oriented toward his Iberian rivals. These fortifications were extended and rehabilitation during the 15th and 16th century completed, during the reigns of his successors John and Manuel, designed by Duarte d'Armas.
Kingdom.
Around 1640, following the Portuguese Restoration War, King John IV established a Counsel of War that formed their territory into military provinces: Minho, Trás-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura, Alentejo and Algarve. Therefore, following the decision of John IV, work began in 1645 under the supervision of João Cosmander to reconstruct the bulwarks. Between 17th and 18th century the fortification was adapted for the time, obtaining the bulwarks and secondary walls, in addition to the installation of permanent military storehouses, stables and barracks. After 1644, many of the reconstruction of the fortress was handled by Nicolau de Langres. A document, dated 14 May 1647, identified Langres as the military engineer of the project, while requesting material for the construction of military square, in addition to the arms necessary to protect the castle and its surrounding territory. In 1662, Luís Serrão Pimentel continued work on the walls.
On 22 May 1680, D. Peter, acting as regent, ordered Mateus do Couto, D. Diogo Pardo and António Rodrigues to Campo Maior, in order to verify the work being done on the citadel, under the plans of Luís Serrão Pimentel.
During the Spanish War of Succession, in 1712, the square was besieged by Spanish forces and defended in the main square.
In 1732, an explosion in powder magazine (caused by thunderstorms) resulted in the destruction of the castle and surrounding walls of the old town around 3:00 in the morning; the space was totally levelled, and many of the homes around the walls were destroyed. At the time of the explosion, the magazine held of gunpowder and 5000 munitions; the violent explosion resulted in a fire that, in addition to the direct deaths, consumed almost half of the towns homes. The powder magazine was reconstructed by order of John V of Portugal in 1735, under the meticulous care of Manuel de Azevedo Fortes. On 2 July 1736, Diogo Lopes de Sepúlveda was awarded the commission to the post of Sargent-Major, as part of his efforts in reconstructing the square after these events.
But, in 1762, Spanish forces, once again, invaded the territory (during the Seven Years War and meeting the Portuguese in Campo Maior.
Peninsular wars.
During the Peninsular War, during the "Battle of the Oranges" (), Portuguese forces capitulated in 1810. After a small victory, these forces recapitulated in 1811.
20th century.
On 18 March 1911, the structure was classified as a national monument by Decree. In the first hald of the 1940s, the "Direcção-Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN)" began works to restore the group of structures. A second phase of construction was began in the 1960s, and extended into the 1970s, marked by interventions in the castle walls and the Chapel of Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos. A third phase of reconstruction began in the latter part of the 1980s, when the castle and walls repaired, just before the castle became the responsibility of the Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico" (IPPAR), on 1 June 1992, Decree-law 106F/92.
Owing to bad weather in 2010, the castle walls were partially destroyed.
Architecture.
The castle is located in an urban context, is walls encircling the area known as Outeiro de Santa Vitória, the top of which is the castle, in altitude, transformed into a citadel with bulwark fortifications. It is positioned, from the Spanish frontier and from Badajoz and Elvas (areas that are visible from its towers), the fortress is encircled in the north, northeast, east and southeast by modern buildings and the town is similarly encircled by agricultural lands.
A heavily walled fortification, formed of a ten-sided polygon curtain of walls, with some missing facades. The walls, from the south, in a clockwise direction: the bulwark of Boa Vista, middle bulwark of São Sebastião, the gates of the "Vila" ("town"), the middle bulwark of Lisbon, middle bulwark of Curral dos Coelhos, bulwark of Santa Cruz, bulwark of Cavaleiro (also referred to as the São João bulwark), the middle bulwark of Príncipe, bulwark of Fonte do Concelho, middle bulwark of São Francisco and middle bulwark of Santa Rosa. The fortification also includes a gap and counterescarp in part of its extension, namely in the south and northeastern parts, as well as four turrets.
A number of military edifices have occupied the spaces within the castle, collectively maintaining several of the existing buildings in some form of use (the warehouses, barracks, stables and living spaces).
The castle retains two of its six original towers, an irregular rectangular space with walls forming a trapezoid space, with battlements and adarve permitting access to the remaining towers. The towers have battlements and walls, terminating in a frusto-pyramidal domes, rounded at the top. Each tower has a vaulted ceiling at the adarve, with the northern tower exemplified by a decorated Renaissance window. To the south, are the walls that circle the old village of Campo Maior, a rough design in the form of an elipse, with seven towers, six rectangular and one, in the northeast, octagonal, forming the main entrance to the complex. The walls are lower, in order to support barbettes and canon emplacements. One of the towers, in the southwest, along one of the false gates has battlements. To the southeast is, also, the Chapel of Senhor dos Aflitos.
The castle grounds are semi-/permanently occupied by cultural (museum historical and military architecture of Campo Maior); residential (part of the bulwarks occupied by residences, in the middle bulwark of São Sebastião there are gypsy communities); and equipment (part of the bulwarks occupied by storerooms and facilities for breeding of animals, as well as waste disposal).

Francis Xavier Ford

Francis Xavier Ford, M.M., was an American bishop of the Catholic Church and a Maryknoll missionary in China. Because of his torture by the Communist Chinese and death in prison in 1952, he is considered a martyr, and the cause for his canonization has begun, granting him the religious title of Servant of God.
Life.
Early life and priesthood.
Ford was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Austin Brendan Ford and Elizabeth Rellihan Ford. He attended Cathedral College in Elmhurst, Queens. While studying there, he felt a call to respond to the vision of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, just founded in 1911 by the Catholic bishops of the United States for overseas service. Upon completion of his high school studies, he was accepted by the Society.
When Ford reported to the Maryknoll seminary in Ossining, New York, on 14 September 1912, he became the first student of the fledgling Maryknoll Society. He was the first person to matriculate in this institution. He was ordained on December 5, 1917, and became one of the first four American Catholic priests to arrive in China in 1918.
Missionary service.
In 1918 Ford began to serve in the Province of Canton (Guangdong), in southern China, and in 1921 opened the first Maryknoll mission in China. He was named Prefect Apostolic of a new mission in Kaying (Meizhou) in northern Guangdong in 1925. The Prefecture was raised to the status of a Vicariate Apostolic in 1935, with Ford named as Vicar Apostolic, for which he was appointed the titular bishop of Etenna. He was consecrated a bishop by Bishop James Anthony Walsh, M.M., the Superior General of the Maryknoll Society on September 21, 1935.
During twenty years of serving in Kaying, Ford increased his flock from 9,000 to 20,000, and built schools, hostels and churches. He was chairman of the Chinese Catholic Welfare Conference for Southern China and played an important role in establishing the first overseas convent for the Maryknoll Sisters. When World War II started, Kaying was surrounded by Japanese troops. Nevertheless, the bishop remained at his post, aiding Chinese guerrillas, helping downed Allied airmen escape, relieving war refugees in distress. Shortly after the war ended, in April 1946, the vicariate was raised by the Holy See to the status of a full diocese, with Ford appointed as its first bishop.
Torture and death.
The victory of the forces of the Chinese Communist Party over the Nationalist forces of General Chiang Kai-shek in October 1949 marked a major shift in the fate of the Catholic missions. In December 1950 the Communists placed Bishop Ford and his secretary, Sister Joan Marie Ryan, M.M., under house arrest and charged them with espionage. Though never tried, Ford was taken from his home four months later and publicly paraded, beaten and degraded in some of the cities in which he had done mission work since 1918. His treatment at the hands of the Communists is attested to by Ryan. 
In one town, a Communist-orchestrated mob beating was so intense that even Ford's Communist guards fled. Though knocked to the ground repeatedly, Ford continued to walk calmly through the crowd until his guards returned. In another town, his neck was bound with a wet rope which almost choked him as it dried and shrank. Another rope was made to trail from under his gown like a tail. To humiliate them both, the Communists forced Sr. Joan Marie to verify this to undress before Ryan. The last time she saw the bishop alive was in February 1952, just before he died. She reported that his hair had turned completely white and he was so emaciated that a fellow prisoner remarked that he looked "like a sack of potatoes".
Ford died in a prison in Guangzhou on February 21, 1952. He was the first American Roman Catholic bishop and fourth American civilian known to have died in the prisons of the Chinese Communists.
Ford's diocese would have been the first Maryknoll territory to be turned over to the native clergy had the Communists not suppressed the local Catholic community. Ford was Maryknoll's first martyr, and the first to be killed at the hands of Chinese Communists. Ford's remains were never found, having been intentionally scattered by the Chinese Communists. At the time of his death, Ford had been a priest for 34 years and a bishop for 16 years.
Legacy.
Cause for canonization.
A cause for the canonization of Ford was been introduced by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. Auxiliary Bishop Ignatius A. Catanello is the postulator of the cause.
On July 27, 2011, George Weigel wrote an article for the "First Things" blog, questioning why Ford has not yet been beatified. Wiegel opined that the process has been put on hold because of Roman authorities' concerns about offending the Chinese government. Weigel further stated that "Catholics [in China need the encouragement of a witness like that given by Francis Xavier Ford, whose blood may yet prove to have paved the King's Highway in the Middle Kingdom".
Bishop Ford is the cousin of another Roman Catholic Maryknoll martyr, Sister Ita Ford, M.M., who was tortured, raped and murdered in El Salvador by members of a military death squad along with fellow Catholic missionaries Maura Clarke, M.M., laywoman Jean Donovan, and Sister Dorothy Kazel, O.S.U., on December 2, 1980. She had previously worked with the poor and war refugees as a Maryknoll Sister missionary in Bolivia and Chile.

Ragnhild Jølsen

Ragnhild Theodora Jølsen (28 March 1875 – 28 January 1908) was a Norwegian author. Norwegian oral traditions were a recurring theme in her works. Her writings often focused on the conflict between the old rural society and modern industrial society.
Biography.
Ragnhild Jølsen grew up on the historic Ekeberg farm ("Ekeberg gård") in Enebakk, Akershus, Norway. This large farm had been in her family since 1634 and remained so until sold in 1903. Ragnhild Jølsen was youngest of nine children, four of whom died early. She moved to Kristiania in 1889 after the family had been hit hard financially. Her father, Holm Jølsen (1833–1906) was an early industrial pioneer and ran Norway's third largest match factory in Ekebergdalen between 1866 and 1886. She completed grammar school in 1891. Ragnhild Jølsen moved back to Enebakk in 1896. She attended a local girl's school ("Nissens pikeskole"). She later worked as a governess with relatives in Enebakk (1897–1898).
Jølsen was seen as a controversial author in a period of great change, as society transformed itself from the old ways founded on small farming communities into the modern industrial society. Short, chopped-up sentences were typical of her writing style, almost maniacally sounding, as in Biblical form, and her depictions always moved in the intersection between dream and reality. Having received a grant she traveled to Rome in November 1906 and returned to Enebakk in July 1907. There she began an affair with the married Norwegian painter Carl Dørnberger (1864–1940).
Jølsen died in January 1908, allegedly having taken an overdose of sleeping powder. She left for posterity some of Norwegian literature's most forceful depictions of agony-manifesting women. Both in her private life and as a writer she was an outsider, and during most of her short life she lived the life of a bohemian. Add to that her books which shocked her contemporaries with their open depictions of the sex lives and drives of women which caused some reviewers to assert that it had to be a man and not a woman who had written them.
For most of the period since her death she has wrongly been portrayed in Norway as a representative of a contemporary class of homestead writers, when in fact only her short story collection "Brukshistorier" ("Factory Tales") belongs to this genre. The quite different style which characterizes the bulk of her novels is the meandering motifs of art nouveau and a consistent fatalistic decadence which depicts itself in her intense and admirable authorship. 
In 1938, a memorial stone was erected with a bronze relief of Ragnhild Jølsen in her home community of Enebakk. In 2008, the municipality organized events to commemorate the centennial of her death. In 1964, Jens Bjørneboe partially depicted her life in the biographical novel "Drømmen og Hjulet" ("The Dream and the Wheel"). In 1988, Aschehoug published the works of Ragnhild Jølsen in a new edition with an additional release in 2008. In 2008, Håkon Tysdal wrote "Fra Ign til Fontana di Trevi - en reise gjennom Ragnhild Jølsens siste leveår" ("From Ign to Fontana di Trevi - a Journey Through the Last Years of Ragnhild Jølsen's Life"). A new biography written by Arnhild Skre was also published in the autumn of 2008. "Moys", a Norwegian rock band from Enebakk, has composed music to go along with Ragnhild Jølsen's texts in the album "Måneskinn og tåke" ("Moonlight and Mist") released in November 2009.

Castle of Evoramonte

The Castle of Evoramonte, alternately spelled "Évora Monte" or "Évoramonte", () is a Portuguese castle in the civil parish of Evoramonte, municipality of Estremoz in the former district of Évora. Initiated in 1160, in the Gothic period, it was enlarged in later centuries in the Manueline style. It was at this site that the Concession of Evoramonte (or the "Convention of Evoramonte") on was signed on 26 May 1834, that ended Liberal Wars between the Liberal forces of Queen Maria II of Portugal (under the regency of her father Peter VI of Portugal) and Absolutist armies of Miguel of Portugal. Since 1910, it has been listed as a Portuguese National monument. 
History.
Sometime during the 12th century, the region of Évora Monte was conquered from the Moors by the forces of Geraldo Sem Pavor. By 1248, a foral ("charter") was issued to the region to provide incentives for settlement, which was reaffirmed in 1271.
Around 1306, King Denis ordered the fortification of the town: it was at this time that construction of the castle began, that included the main structure, walls and gates.
A new foral was issued in 1516, by King Manuel, passing into the control of Nuno Álvares Pereira. The reconstruction campaign during Manuel's reign, beginning in 1516, resulted in the fortification with four cylindrical towers defining the rectangular perimeter by Francisco de Arruda (completed in 1531).
An earthquake in 1531 destroyed the keep tower of the medieval castle. This structure was then rebuilt by Teodósio I, Duke of Braganza, who, at that time, was master of the region and town.
On 26 May 1834, the Concession of Evoramonte was signed between Miguel of Portugal and his brother Peter VI of Portugal, in the name of his daughter Maria da Glória, ending the Liberal Wars. 
In 1855 the municipality of Evoramonte was extinguished, and its historical administration divided into the neighbouring municipalities of Estremoz, Évora, Arraiolos and Redondo.
Between 1930 and 1940, were the first public works to recuperate and renovate the grounds and castle of Evoramonte, under the supervision of the "Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais" (DGMEN). These actions, which primarily occurred in 1937, included the restoration of the towers and the consolidation of the parapets.
Subsequent interventions occurred between 1971-1979, in projects to restore the castle; 1980-1981, in the recuperation of the walls; in 1982, the construction of a sanitation system; followed in 1984 by new restoration projects, culminating in the phase two project in 1986 (which included construction and restoration accompanied with photography of the repairs). Finally in 1987, electricity was installed on the grounds.
On 1 June 1992, under Decree 106F/92, this building was transferred into the stewardship of the "Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico" (IPPAR), in order to rehabilitate and monetize the structure.
February 2006, marked the beginning of commemorations to celebrate the castle's 700 years of existence.
Architecture.
The castle crowns the escarpment of Serra d' Ossa, with a commanding view of the local and distant routes, dominating one of the largest squares in Portugal: the municipality of Estremoz.
An unusual rectangular building, the castle includes circular towers molded into the structure, providing the castle with an aggressive and powerful characteristics. The building is much larger at the base, and is chamfered to the height of its three storeys, and crowned by large merlons. The three floors are clearly delineated by a ring-shaped cornice at each level, typical of the Manueline style, these cornices are sculpted into a rope, tied at the frontispiece of the structure. At various places along the cylindrical towers are canon emplacements, narrower to the interior, that provide an image that is bellicose and somber. On each storey there is a rectangular window, except on the ground floor exposed to the north, where a portico is fixed.
In the large salon on the first floor, the vaulted ovular ceiling is supported by four columns, and raised into a mess of sculpted veins. A similar lattice, though smaller, is used in the remaining floors. By the cylindrical towers in the west, a circular staircase provides access to successive floors.

Francisco José Ynduráin

Francisco José Ynduráin Muñoz (23 December 1940 – 6 June 2008) was a Spanish theoretical physicist. He founded the particle physics research group that became the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Autonomous University of Madrid, where he was a Professor. He was described by his colleagues as "a scientist that always searched for excellence in research".
Early life.
Yndurain was born in Benavente (Zamora) and grew up in Saragossa. After graduating from Saragossa’s San Agustin High school, he received his M.S. degree in mathematics in 1962 and in 1964 his PhD in physics. He obtained both degrees from the University of Zaragoza (Spain).
While completing his doctoral studies, he was a visiting scientist at CERN and a Teaching Assistant at the University of Zaragoza (Spain).
Career.
Ynduráin was an associate professor at the University of Zaragoza until 1966. He was a researcher at New York University from 1966 to 1968, at which point he moved to Geneva to become a research fellow at CERN until 1970. He was a Researcher at CERN from then on, as a Senior Scientific Associate (1976–1992), and as a member of the Scientific Policy committee (1988–1994).
In 1970 he took the professor position in Madrid (at the Complutense University and immediately after at the Autonomous University of Madrid) where he founded and headed the Particle Physics Research group. He was Director of the Department of Theoretical Physics (1974–1977 and 1981–1984), Dean of the Faculty of Science (1975) and Deputy President (1978–1981) of the Autonomous University of Madrid. 
He also held other short term appointments at other universities worldwide:
He collaborated with other research centers:
He was a member of the Royal Spanish Physical Society, Royal Academy of Exact Physical and Natural Sciences of Spain, where he was president of the Physics and Chemistry section from 2002 to 2006. He was also member of the American Physical Society, founding member of the European Physical Society and member of the European Academy of Sciences energy committee. In 2004 he was nominated general secretary of the Instituto de España.
Selected Books.
In 1983, Yndurain published a widely used book advanced textbook on quantum field theory for graduate students, "Quantum Chromodynamics: An Introduction to the Theory of Quarks and Gluons". The book has been translated into Russian as "Kvantovaia Khromodinamika". The book was expanded twice: once in 1996 as "Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and Introduction to Field Theory", and again in 1999 as "The Theory of Quark and Gluon Interactions".
Yndurain also wrote books on science for a broader audience. In 1997 he published a book discussing UFOs theories, "Quién anda ahí?", which won the Golondriz award for smart humor in 1998. In 2002 he published a book about the structure of matter entitled "Electrones, neutrinos y quarks". Finally, in 2004 he published a book about science, scientists and history entitled "Los desafíos de la ciencia".
Selected Articles.
Yndurain was an expert in quantum field theory and its application to elementary particles. He authored or co-authored more than 100 scientific papers on high energy physics, nuclear physics and mathematical physics.

In darkness let me dwell

In darkness let me dwell is a song by the lutenist and composer John Dowland. Like many of Dowland's songs, its subject matter is melancholy and its lyrics anonymous. It was published in 1610, late in the composer's career, and shows the influence of Italian music of the early baroque.
Text.
In darkness let me dwell; the ground shall sorrow be,<br>
The roof despair, to bar all cheerful light from me;<br>
The walls of marble black, that moist'ned still shall weep;<br>
My music, hellish jarring sounds, to banish friendly sleep.<br>
Thus, wedded to my woes, and bedded in my tomb,<br>
O let me living die, till death doth come, till death doth come.<br>
My dainties grief shall be, and tears my poison'd wine,<br>
My sighs the air, through which my panting heart shall pine:<br>
My robes my mind shall suit exceeding blackest night,<br>
My study shall be tragic thoughts, sad fancy to delight.<br>
Pale ghosts and frightful shades shall my acquaintance be:<br>
O thus, my hapless joy, I haste to thee, I haste to thee. <br>

The Act-Ups are a Portuguese band formed in Barreiro, in 2001. Formed from the ashes of Country-Punk band The Sullens, they started up with a formation consisting of three guitars, bass, organ and drums. Their first record, I bet you love us too, released through Hey, Pachuco! Recs. in 2003 is a mix of Garage Rock; Punk and Soul, with a guitar driven sound and excellent song work.
<br>Their second record, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell was released in 2006 through Hey, Pachuco! Recs. on CD. The record was also released in a European limited edition through Spanish label Beatnickmoon Rock and Roll Crafts. This record is a more mature and dark record without losing the ingredients that make the Act-Ups' sound so recognizable: fuzz and great soul songs. Band's line-up changed with Pistol Pete replacing Hellso on the drums and Gomez (was made for love) leaving the band.
With this record the band had great acceptance in Spain, which led them to tour the country several times.
Later that year the band released an EP (Take me Home) through Groovie Records. Music from that record was used in "Um ano mais longo", a movie by director Marco Martins.

Ready or Not (novel)

Ready or Not is the sequel to the novel "All-American Girl". Both were written by Meg Cabot, who is also the author of "The Princess Diaries". The book takes place about one year after the events of "All-American Girl".
Plot Description.
Samantha Madison is still teen ambassador to the United Nations and happily dating the President's son, David. She is still a semi-celebrity for saving the President's life, but doesn't like the attention she gets for it. As a way to go back to being unnoticed, Sam dyes her naturally red hair to jet black at the beginning of the novel. She and David also start to take a life-drawing class together. But she didn't realize that it was about sketching nude models.
When David invites her to Camp David to spend Thanksgiving, Sam believes that he wants to have sex. Making her unsure of whether she's ready for that step in their relationship. She consults her older sister Lucy. Who ends up being extremely helpful by giving her sex advice, and buying Sam contraceptives.
Meanwhile, The President recently announced his "Return to Family" campaign. Which includes plans to limit access to abortion and birth control. Samantha is faced with a huge dilemma when she accidentally comes off as condemning the "Return to Family" policy on an MTV special by accidentally implying that she and David have had sex.
Sam receives mostly negative backlash for her remarks, but is supported by her friends and family for being honest. When she goes to Camp David during Thanksgiving, she waits in her room all night for David to come, but he never does. Feeling furious, she sneaks into David's room and berates him for his mixed-messages over them having sex. David replies that he didn't mean to imply that anything was going to happen between them. Making Sam comes to understand that she made up the whole dilemma in her head, but also realizes that she does want to have sex because she loves David.
When Sam comes home, She tells Lucy about her and David's first time, and discovers that Lucy is actually still a virgin. Lucy explains that she wants to find someone she truly loves before taking that big step. Lucy believes that her tutor Harold is The One for her, like David is for Sam.

Jamestowne Society

Jamestowne Society is an organization founded in 1936 by George Craghead Gregory for descendants of stockholders in the Virginia Company of London and the descendants of those who owned land or who had domiciles in Jamestown or on Jamestown Island prior to the year 1700. 
Jamestown.
In May 1607, Jamestown was established as the first permanent English settlement in what is now the United States, following several earlier failed attempts. It was founded by the London branch of the Virginia Company, which was competing with the Plymouth branch to settle the Colony of Virginia. 
Jamestown was the capital of the Colony for 83 years, from 1616 until 1698. At that time, the capital was relocated to Middle Plantation, about distant. (That small community, which had also become home to the new College of William and Mary in 1693, was renamed Williamsburg in 1699).
George Craghead Gregory.
George Craghead Gregory (1878-1956) was an attorney and businessman based in Richmond who had a strong interest in Virginia's history and was also an author and historian. In 1932, he was working at property owned by Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) on Jamestown Island and discovered the foundation of the first brick statehouse (capitol) building circa 1646. 
The society.
The society was formed to bring together as many of the descendants of stockholders in the Virginia Company of London and the descendants of those who owned land or who had domiciles in Jamestown or on Jamestown Island prior to the year 1700 as possible. 
Since its founding, the Society has helped with genealogical records and expanded into dozens of branches, called "Companies." (In the Jamestowne Society, "Companies" are similar to chapters in most lineage societies). Membership in Companies is elective, while membership in the national Society is acquired at the time a member joins. 
In 1958, the Society was formally organized as a non-profit corporation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (1954, as amended). It frequently holds meetings and events.

Party Crasher (Per Gessle album)

Party Crasher is the third English solo album by Swedish pop-rock singer and composer Per Gessle. This is his second worldwide-released English solo album under his own name after "The World According to Gessle" in 1997. Originally scheduled for December 3 in Sweden, but it was released on November 26 a week earlier. The album reached #2 in the Swedish album charts, curiously becoming the first Gessle involved studio album that did not reach #1 in Sweden since Roxette´s "Pearls of Passion", in 1986.
When the album was released via Sony BMG in the UK on 15 June 2009, some fans were disappointed when it was realised that the CD version of the album would only be available to order online and no physical copies were to be available in record stores.

Arthur Kaye Legge

Admiral Sir Arthur Kaye Legge KCB (25 October 1766 – 12 May 1835) was an officer of the British Royal Navy who served in three wars and commanded ships in several campaigns. Known as a brave officer and an effective commander, Legge was given several very important postings in the latter part of his career as a rear-admiral, serving in command at Cadiz during the Peninsula War. After retirement, Legge entered royal service, and was in the procession at the funeral of King George III. A very wealthy man, Legge never married, and when he died in 1835 he left large sums of money to his domestic staff.
Early career.
Arthur Kaye Legge was born in 1766, the sixth son of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth and his wife Frances-Catherine. Among his siblings were George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth, Edward Legge, Bishop of Oxford and Lady Charlotte Feversham, the wife of Lord Feversham. Entering the Navy at a young age, Legge served aboard HMS "Prince George" with the young Prince William off the Eastern Seaboard of North America.
By 1791, Legge was a lieutenant and held an independent command in the Channel Fleet as captain of HMS "Shark". The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 saw Legge promoted, becoming a post captain in the frigate HMS "Niger". In this vessel, Legge served in the fleet under Lord Howe that fought in the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 and the ensuing Glorious First of June. As a frigate captain, Legge was not actively engaged in the battle, but did perform numerous scouting missions during the campaign, relayed signals to the fleet during the battle and gave a tow to badly damaged ships in its aftermath.
In 1795, Legge took command of HMS "Latona" and formed part of the squadron that escorted Caroline of Brunswick to Britain before her marriage to Prince George. In 1797 he moved to HMS "Cambrian" and operated independently off the French Channel coast, sailing from Weymouth. During these services he frequently spent time with royalty visiting the port and captured a number of French prizes. Legge remained in command of "Cambrian" until the Peace of Amiens in 1802.
With the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Legge was recalled to the Navy and took command of the ship of the line HMS "Revenge". In 1805 "Revenge" was ordered to cruise off the Spanish coast and captured a valuable Spanish merchantship and also participated in the Battle of Cape Finisterre under Robert Calder against the combined Franco-Spanish fleet of Pierre-Charles Villeneuve. By 1807, "Revenge" was stationed with the Mediterranean Fleet and participated in the Dardanelles Operation under John Thomas Duckworth. During the attempt to reach Constantinople, "Revenge" suffered ten men killed and 14 wounded. Legge was later part of the naval contingent in the Walcheren Expedition and, with thousands of his men, contracted malaria and was evacuated home, severely ill.
Flag rank.
In July 1810, Legge was promoted to rear-admiral and the following year was appointed to be commander at Cadiz in "Revenge". The Spanish port was an important position as it was the seat of the Spanish government during the Peninsular War which was raging at that time. Legge performed well in this position and returned to Britain in September 1812 to become admiral in command of the River Thames. Legge held this command, from the frigate HMS "Thisbe" until the end of the war in 1815. 
As a member of the nobility, Legge had numerous royal contacts, and became a Groom of the Bedchamber in 1801, a ceremonial position that he retained for the rest of his life. He later marched in the procession at George III's funeral in 1820. By the time of his retirement, Legge had risen to vice-admiral and been made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He later became a full admiral in 1830. Legge never married, and on his death in 1835, he was reported to have left over £3,000 to his butler, £1,000 each to his groom, footman, coachman and housekeeper and other substantial amounts to his other servants. He was buried in the family vault in Lewisham.

Karst Shepherd

The Karst Shepherd ( or "" ) is a breed of dog of the livestock guardian type, originating in Slovenia. This Mountain dog breed is recognised under sponsorship from Macedonia by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.
Appearance.
The Karst Shepherd Dog is of medium size, harmonious, robust, endowed with a well-developed musculature and a strong constitution. The tail and ears are hanging. Length of body in proportion to height at withers should be no less than 9 : 8. Skull is a little longer (13 to 14 cm) than the muzzle (11 to 12 cm / 4.3 to 4.7 in). Width of skull (13 to 14 cm / 5.2 to 5.5 in) is equal to its length.
Their hair is well furnished, long, flat, with abundant undercoat. The head the front edges of the ears and the front part of the legs covered with short hair. The back edge of the ears has longer and more supple hair. In its upper region, the neck has long hair, stiff and very bushy forming a mane; in its lower part, the hair is longer and more supple forming a ruff which is wider at the set of the neck. The trunk and belly have long hair which becomes less hard on the belly. The tail regularly bushy, does not form a plume. On the back side of the forequarters, the long hair is very supple forming fringes. On the back side of the hindquarters, the hair is even longer and bushy forming culottes. The length of the top coat is at least .
Coat is iron grey; especially on the back, a dark shade is preferred; towards the belly and the limbs, the colour turns without visible transition to a light grey or sandy colour, with a dark streak on the front parts of the limbs. The dark mask on the muzzle spreads on to the skull. On the back part of the head it is bordered with grey or sandy or pale fawn hair overlaid with black.
Height at the withers for dogs is 57 to 63 cm with an ideal size of , and weight is 30 to 42 kg (66 to 92.4 lbs). Females are 54 to 60 cm with an ideal size of and a weight of 25 to 37 kg (55 to 81.4 lbs).
Temperament.
The breed standard describes the dog as having a sharp temperament and strong individuality, distrustful of strangers. It's a good guard dog. Like all large dogs, the Karst Shepherd needs to be well socialized while very young, with people if the dog is to be a companion, and with livestock if the dog is to be a guardian. If the breed's background is taken into consideration, and if the dog is well socialized and trained, he may make a good family dog. Temperament of individual dogs may vary.
History.
The Karst Shepherd is named after the Karst Plateau in Slovenia and Italy, and more generally after the Karst landscape that extends to Croatia and partly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the Gulf of Trieste to the Dinaric Alps. Mostly bred in Slovenia and Istria in Croatia. The ancestral type of the modern day breed travelled with shepherds through this area, and most likely came with ancient nomadic pastoralists. In 1689, the etnographer Janez Vajkard Valvasor mentioned the shepherd's dogs of the area in his work "The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola" without description of dogs. In the 20th century, when the landrace shepherd dogs began to be documented as a modern breed, it was first referred to as the Illyrian Shepherd (1939). Karst Shephard and Šarplaninac were considered Type A and B of the Illyrian Shepherd Dog by the Yugoslavian Federation of Cynology for some time, leading to some cases of crossing between both breeds. After comparing typical dogs of both "Types" the Federation recognised Karst Shephard and Šarplaninac as two distinct breeds in 1968.
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognises the breed in Group 2, Section 2.2 Molossoid breeds-Mountain type, number 278. The breed has also been exported to the United States, where it is recognised by The United Kennel Club in the Guardian Dog Group. The breed is also recognised by various minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.
During the 20th century there were several periods when the number of Karst Shephards was low. Fearing inbreeding a decision was made to introduce a single male Newfoundland into the population. The total number (including puppies, sterilised dogs and dogs not suitable for breeding) of Karst Shepherds in 2008 was estimated between 600 and 700.
A breeding program was accepted in 2009 to boost the number of dogs, improve their characteristics and preserve their genetic diversity. To avoid popular sire effect every sire can father up to 3 litters, sire must be unrelated to the dam (no common great grandparents), genetic distance between them must be higher than 0.45. Dogs with heritable diseases, atypical physical and behavioural characteristics are excluded from the program. Exceptions are possible with DLVKOS permission.

Institut français du Proche-Orient

The Institut français du Proche-Orient (IFPO), or French Institute of the Near East, is part of the network of French Research Centres abroad. It has branches in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
History.
The IFPO was created in 2003 by bringing together three existing French Institutes in the area : IFEAD (French Institute for Arab Studies in Damascus, established in 1922), IFAPO (French Institute of near Eastern Archaeology established in Syria and Lebanon in 1946) and CERMOC (Centre for Study and Research on the Contemporary Middle East, est. 1977 in Lebanon and 1988 in Jordan). The IFPO has the status of a "Joint Entity of French Research Institutes Abroad" (UMIFRE no6, Unité Mixte des Instituts français de recherche à l’étranger) and is under the aegis of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research).
Fields of research and area purposes.
IFPO is active in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and hopes to be able to extend its activities to Iraq and the Palestinian Territories. Its Director-General, who is based in Damascus, is Eberhard Kienle, who was preceded by François Burgat (2008-2013), Jean-Yves L’Hôpital (June 2005-May 2008) and Christian Décobert (Jan. 2003-Aug. 2004). The Institute’s tasks are research, research training, the diffusion of knowledge and cooperation with local and international institutions. These tasks are carried out with the support of the local Ministries in charge of Research and Higher Education, and in close cooperation with both. 
The Institute acts as a centre for study and research in all fields relating to the ancient and modern civilizations of the Near East. On the basis of the numerous activities and publications of its researchers, the institute aims at raising the French contribution to research to the highest academic standards in the various fields of research related to these civilizations, from the earliest times to the contemporary period. The Institute also trains young researchers for careers in teaching and research.
Organization.
The Institute is organised into three scientific departments : Archeology and Ancient History (Director Frédéric Alpi) ; Arab, Medieval and Modern Studies (director : Bruno Lory) ; Contemporary Studies (director : Myriam Catusse). 
In its different locations, the Institute recruits experienced researchers (at various levels in their careers) from France, from the three countries in which it is established, from Europe and from the rest of the world. They come for a maximum of four years and are selected to take part in the various academic projects initiated by the Institute. It also welcomes receives young researchers (PHD candidates, grant holders, etc.) of all nationalities to take part in its activities. The duration of their stay varies according to their individual situation.
The Institute also awards some short-term grants for limited projects. Since many of these researchers also belong to other research teams or programmes in France and elsewhere, the Institute hopes that these projects will strengthen and broaden its academic network.

The 2002 United States Senate election in Georgia took place on November 5, 2002. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Max Cleland ran for re-election to a second term, but lost to Republican Saxby Chambliss.
Campaign.
Chambliss's campaign used the refrain of national defense and security, but drew criticism for television ads that paired images of Cleland and Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, and for questioning the commitment to homeland security of his opponent, a triple amputee and decorated Vietnam veteran. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona said of one ad, "It's worse than disgraceful, it's reprehensible." McCain, along with Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, made significant complaints to the Republican National Committee until the ads were taken down.

Eliza Suggs

Elizabeth Gertrude Suggs (December 11, 1876 - January 29, 1908) was a 19th century American author, born to former slaves. Afflicted with severe physical disabilities, she was able to gain an education and became known as a Temperance lecturer. The little that is known about Eliza Suggs can be found in her book, "Shadows and Sunshine", published in 1906. 
Childhood.
Eliza Suggs was born in Bureau County, Illinois, the youngest of four daughters of James and Malinda (Filbrick) Suggs. Both of the parents had been born in slavery, James in North Carolina and Malinda in Alabama; they met while on a Mississippi plantation, where Malinda had four children. James Suggs had fought in the American Civil War, serving in Company I, of the 55th United States Colored Troops, where he was wounded; after he recovered, he reenlisted, this time in Company C of the 59th United States Colored Troops and served until the end of the war. He worked as a blacksmith, farmer and laborer, but after 1873, he was a preacher in the Free Methodist Church. The family lived in Mississippi, Illinois, and Kansas before settling in Harlan County, Nebraska. 
Her parents had three daughters before her, all born in Illinois. At birth, she appeared to be a totally normal baby, but soon her parents began to realize that something wasn’t quite right. At four weeks old, Eliza Suggs began crying incessantly. It took her mother a day to realize that her infant daughter had broken a limb. After that bone had healed, Eliza’s arm broke. Her bones broke with the gentlest of moves, and they did not expect their fourth child to live very long. However, she went on to live into her thirty-second year. 
For the next six years, Eliza could barely move, much less even sit up on her own. Where the average child’s day consisted of playing and having fun with friends and siblings, hers consisted of sitting in her carriage before the window, only able to watch the others. When Eliza was around five or six years old, her parents had her burial clothes made. As soon as the garments were finished, they expected to need to use them in short order, half wishing that their daughter’s suffering would end. Much to their surprise, their daughter hung on into early adulthood.
In the beginning, the doctors could not find out what was wrong with her. However, as she grew older, and medical techniques slowly improved, she was diagnosed with what was then called Rickets, or what is more modernly called Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
Education.
In her early years, Suggs didn’t get around or out much, but when her family moved to a new area, they were lucky to know the teacher of one of the local schools. However, her classroom was upstairs, and therefore virtually impossible for her to access on her own. After close family friends donated a chair more suitable than Eliza’s baby carriage, that was her main mode of transportation and it was decided that she would be able to attend school. Either her mother or her sister Kate would wheel her to school with the rest of the girls, and would carry her up the stairs to the classroom. She would be deposited there for the day, and at the end of the day, her mother or sister would come and get her again, carrying her down the stairs, and wheeling her back home. This allowed Suggs to learn everything her sisters and friends were learning, and resulted in her becoming an educated woman, which was unique for a woman of black heritage, even after the Civil War had ended.
Efforts.
She was a Free Methodist active in the temperance movement. Before her father's death in 1889, Eliza assisted him in Temperance work; after his death, she struck out on her own. Accompanied by her sister Kate, Eliza would attend various gatherings, including Temperance conferences, camp meetings and church services, and briefly speak about her life, her sufferings, and her devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ and how they sustained her.
Death.
Eliza Suggs died on January 29, 1908 in Orleans, Nebraska and is buried in the family plot in Orleans Cemetery.

Windows on Earth

Windows on Earth is a museum exhibit, Web site, and exploration tool, developed by TERC, Inc. (Technical Education Research Centers, an educational non-profit organization), and the Association of Space Explorers, that enables the public to explore an interactive, virtual view of Earth from space. In addition, the tool has been selected by NASA to help astronauts identify targets for photography from the International Space Station (ISS). 
The program simulates the view of Earth as seen from a window aboard the ISS, in high-resolution, photographically accurate colors and 3D animations. The views include cloud cover, day and night cycles, night time lights, and other features that help make the exhibit realistic and interactive.
Earth Visualization Software.
Windows on Earth provides the user a view of Earth from an astronaut's viewpoint, with interactive photorealistic views of Earth as if seen from an altitude of 360 km. The program uses GeoFusion's digital Earth visualization system, which renders accurate views of Earth with terrain, satellite imagery, clouds, and other layers. The system is programmed for user interaction, allowing users to "fly" anywhere they wish to see, and zoom in or out to see details. The system's imagery is derived from Landsat, and features 3D perspective views. Former astronaut Jay Apt assisted with the color-correction of the images, to help get the most realistic colors as seen from space. The program is updated daily to include accurate cloud cover information.
Development and Outreach Partners.
Windows on Earth was created by people from the Center for Earth and Space Science Education (CESSE) at TERC, a not-for profit math and science education company located in Cambridge, MA, in partnership with the Association of Space Explorers, GeoFusion's, and WorldSat International and with funding from the National Science Foundation, Informal Science Education.
Additional partners include the Challenger Learning Center and NASA's Johnson Space Center.
Museums.
The Windows on Earth museum exhibit can be found in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Boston's Museum of Science, the Montshire Museum of Science in Vermont, the St. Louis Science Center, and the Connecticut Science Center.
Garriott Mission.
Windows on Earth flew on board the International Space Station (ISS). On October 12, 2008, Richard Garriott launched aboard Soyuz TMA-13 to the ISS as a Spaceflight participant. Garriott remained on board the station for 10 days, conducting educational and scientific programs and experiments. Earth observation was one of his prime tasks on this mission, and he used the Windows on Earth system to help him take pictures of specific targets.
After the mission, Richard's photographs, along with ones taken by his astronaut father Owen Garriott, who flew on Skylab 3 (1973) and STS-9 (1983), are available to the public through Windows on Earth. This provides a unique opportunity for comparing areas of Earth photographed by two generations of space explorers, showing how Earth’s surface (and the technology of Earth observation) has changed over 35 years, from 1973 to 2008.
Tool for the ISS.
In May 2012, NASA selected Windows on Earth as the new tool to help astronauts identify targets for photography from the ISS.

List of re-education through labor camps in China

Re-education through labor (RTL; in Chinese, "laodong jiaoyang" 劳动教养, abbreviated láojiào 劳教) is a system of administrative detentions in the People's Republic of China. The estimated number of detainees in re-education through labor camps is anywhere from 300,000 ("China Labor Bulletin", 2007) to 2 million (Laogai Research Foundation, 2006). There are at least 310 camps in China ("China Daily", 2007).

New England Air Transport

New England Air Transport was an airline based in Maine, launched in August, 2008. The airline, geared towards business travelers, tourists, and those seeking medical treatment, was focused on air service between Aroostook and Cumberland counties, the northernmost and southernmost parts of the state, respectively. It marked the first time there has been intra-Maine air service in nearly a decade. The airline hope to expand to Eastern Canada in the future. 
On October 18, 2009, David A. Fernald, the President of New England Air Transport, announced in a press release that the airline would be suspending operations, stating that "until we come out of this current economic downturn it is unlikely that cash from operations will be sufficient to support continued scheduled flight service". Fernald announced in the statement that, if able to reorganize, they will continue to provide charter service.

Newspaper format

Newspaper formats vary substantially, with different formats more common in different countries. The size of a newspaper format refers to the size of the paper page; the printed area within that can vary substantially depending on the newspaper.
In some countries, particular formats have associations with particular types of newspaper; for example, in the United Kingdom, there is a distinction between "tabloid" and "broadsheet" as references to newspaper content quality, which originates with the more popular newspapers using the tabloid format; hence "tabloid journalism".
Trends.
Manfred Werfel Research Director and Vice President of IFRA predicts a trend towards the Berliner format.[http://www.abacho.com/mobile/news/vermischtes/anzeigen/?news_id=32742] In 2006, Manfred Werfel revised the DIN 16604 from 1975. 
In a recent trend, many newspapers have been undergoing what is known as "web cut down", in which the publication is redesigned to print using a narrower (and less expensive) roll of paper. In extreme examples, some broadsheet papers are nearly as narrow as traditional tabloids.
An average roll of , diameter newsprint rolled out is long.

SCAR Southern Ocean Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey

Several countries collaborate in the survey providing vessels to tow Continuous Plankton Recorders (CPRs) in a near circum-Antarctic survey. Tows conducted between Hobart and the French Antarctic station Dumont d’Urville are also conducted in collaboration with the IMOSAustralian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey. The SO-CPR Survey is supported by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and its Expert Group on Continuous Plankton Research, which helps promote and develop the survey. 
The CPRs are towed from research and supply vessels. The CPR is towed at about 10 metres below the surface and for about 450 nautical miles (830 km) per tow. The plankton enters a small opening in the device and is trapped and preserved between two layers of silk mesh. These vessels also collect at the same time underway data such as sea surface temperature, salinity, fluorometry, light and other oceanographic-meteorological parameters. All plankton in five nautical mile (9 km) equivalent sections are identified to the lowest possible taxa, usually species and counted. Antarctic krill and other euphausiids are identified to developmental stage. Plankton counts are combined with averaged environmental data for each . 
Use of the SO-CPR data for research purposes is encouraged. Data are made available soon after the CPR samples are processed. Data are held at the Australian Antarctic Data Centre and at the SCAR Marine Biodiversity Information Network.

Crime in Vatican City

Crime in the Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting — by outsiders. The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.
Petty crimes per capita.
The Vatican's small size results in a few statistical oddities. There are 18 million visitors to the state each year, and the most common crime is petty theft — purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting by outsiders. 
Based on a population of 455 in 1992, the 397 civil offences in that year represent a crime rate of 0.87 crimes per capita, with 608 penal offences or 1.33 per capita.
Policing.
The "Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano" () is the gendarmerie, or police and security force, of Vatican City and the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.
The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the pope outside of Vatican City. The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Security and Civil Defense Services Department (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.
Cooperation with the Italian government.
In accordance with article 22 of the 1929 Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, the Italian government, when requested by the Holy See, seeks prosecution and detention of criminal suspects, at the expense of the Vatican. 
The Vatican has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention. People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.
Abolition of capital punishment (1969).
In 1969, the Vatican state abolished capital punishment. It had been envisaged in legislation the Vatican adopted in 1929 based on Italian law, but the power was never exercised.
Notable incidents.
Assassination attempt.
A few major criminal events have occurred in recent decades within Vatican territory. On May 13, 1981, Pope John Paul II suffered an assassination attempt by Mehmet Ali Ağca. This episode led to a much stronger emphasis on the Swiss Guard's functional, non-ceremonial roles. This has included enhanced training in unarmed combat and small arms. The small arms are the same as those used in the Swiss army.
Swiss Guard killing.
On May 4, 1998, the Swiss Guard experienced one of its greatest scandals for over 100 years when the commander of the Guard, Alois Estermann, was murdered in unclear circumstances in Vatican City. According to the official Vatican version, Estermann and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero, were killed by the young Swiss Guard Cédric Tornay, who later committed suicide. Estermann had been named commander of the Swiss Guard the same day. There has been speculation of a homosexual affair between Estermann and Tornay which ended in the killing.
Vatican Bank scandal.
The Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main share-holder. Father Paul Marcinkus, head of the Institute for Religious Works from 1971 to 1989, was indicted in Italy in 1982 as an accessory in the $3.5 billion collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, one of the major post-war financial scandals. Banco Ambrosiano was accused of laundering drug money for the Sicilian Mafia.
Alleged collaboration with the Ustasha.
The class action suit against the Vatican Bank and others was filed by attorneys Tom Easton and Dr. Jonathan H. Levy in San Francisco, California on November 15, 1999. According to plaintiffs, defendants "accepted, concealed, hypothecated, laundered, retained, converted and profited from assets looted by the Ustasha regime during April 1941 through May 1945 and deposited in, or converted, concealed, hypothecated, trafficked, credited, pledged, exchanged, laundered or liquidated through, the IOR, and OFM after the demise of the NDH-Independent State of Croatia in May 1945."
Theft of secret documents.
The Vatileaks case is a scandal involving leaked Vatican documents, allegedly exposing corruption. The scandal first came to light in January 2012 when Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi published letters from Carlo Maria Viganò, formerly the second ranked Vatican administrator to the pope, in which he begged not to be transferred for having exposed alleged corruption that cost the Holy See millions in higher contract prices. Viganò is now the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. Paolo Gabriele, the papal butler, was indicted by Vatican magistrates on 13 August 2012 for aggravated theft.

Vacuum-anchor

In large scale oceanic civil engineering, vacuum-anchors are ocean bottom fasteners used to anchor deep seas oil platforms (example: See Troll A Oil Platform) and other gravity base technology based structures in the soupy soft bottomed muck found on many oil bearing continental shelves and the world's shallower seas. Gravity based anchor legs flare out forming a wider footprint where they contact the bottom much as the webbed feet of many aquatic animals increase the surface area above the vacuum-anchors which are open ended long cylindrical shaped deep cups with a sealed top end closed by a valve which connects and anchors mechanically to the legs of the gravity based structure. The valve is used to exhaust any gases and liquid which seeks to escape the trapped sea bottom materials entering the open end of the anchor.
Physically, these are the upscaled analog of a tall drinking glass filled with water then turned upside down and secured in place bottom-side-up. When a lifting or sideways force is applied to such a container, the weight and inertia of the enclosed mass (The mushy gravel, mud, water, and rock solution of the sea bed) must also be displaced (lifted or moved sideways) which anchors them firmly in place within the surrounding materials of the soft bottom. When lifted, any enclosed material attempting to spill out of the enclosure creates a vacuum, just as does the container in the kitchen sink, giving the anchor their name.
Six to seven 40 m tall, 20 m diameter steel vacuum-anchor cylinders are used to anchor the four legs of the troll A platform depicted above. The Troll A platform stands on the sea floor below the surface of the sea and each of the continuous-slip-formed concrete cylindrical legs has an elevator that takes over nine minutes to travel from the platform above the waves to the sea floor.

Ray Whitrod

Raymond Wells Whitrod AC CVO QPM (16 April 1915 - 11 July 2003) was an Australian police officer and criminologist. He was considered a world leader in the way society treats victims of crime. He was known as a man of high professional standards, with a commitment to justice, equity and integrity. He became best known for his term as Queensland Police Commissioner, resigning in protest in 1976 at the corruption then endemic in Queensland, and in particular over the appointment by the Premier of Queensland Joh Bjelke-Petersen of Terry Lewis, as Assistant Commissioner. 
Career.
Ray Whitrod was born in Adelaide in 1915, attending Adelaide High School. He joined the South Australia Police (SAPOL) in 1934. He was engaged in detective work from 1937 to 1941. He left to join the Royal Australian Air Force, seeing service as a navigator in north Africa and Europe. He then rejoined SAPOL.
In 1949 Whitrod moved to Sydney where he helped establish the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), and was engaged in investigating Soviet espionage. He was at the centre of investigations into Vladimir Petrov and his wife Evdokia, who defected in 1954. 
He joined the Commonwealth Investigation Service as its director, moving to Canberra. The CIS became the Commonwealth Police Force (now the Australian Federal Police) in 1960, and Whitrod was its first commissioner. He remained in this post for nine years. He was the driving force behind the Commonwealth Police Act and the Australian Police College, now the Australian Institute of Police Management, at North Head.
In 1963 he attained a Bachelor of Economics degree from the Australian National University (ANU), which he had been studying part-time since the late 1950s. He attained a postgraduate degree in criminology at the University of Cambridge in 1965.
He served as the Papua New Guinea Police Commissioner from 1969 to 1970. This came about after a casual telephone conversation with the retiring commissioner, a personal friend, who asked Whitrod to ask around to see of there was anyone willing to replace him. Whitrod agreed to make some enquiries, but could find nobody willing. He reported back to the retiring commissioner, who said that his departure date was fixed, and asked if Whitrod himself might be interested. Without even consulting with his wife, he agreed. 
Ray Whitrod became Queensland Police Commissioner in 1970 and immediately set out to eradicate corruption, raise educational standards and bring women into all fields of policing. He organised for the Queensland Education Department to provide officers with classes in literacy and basic arithmetic. As an inducement to attend classes, he offered an extra week's leave for every subject they sat. The Police Union objected with such vehemence that they by-passed both Whitrod and his Police Minister, Max Hodges, and complained directly to the Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Bjelke-Petersen, himself a former Police Minister, endorsed the union's stand and he publicly declared that "the Queensland people do not require their police to be Rhodes scholars". Whitrod clashed with the Premier on other matters.
The last straw was the appointment of the little-known Terry Lewis to be Whitrod's Assistant Commissioner. The position had become vacant, and Whitrod chose his preferred candidate. He advised the Cabinet of this name, and the names of two others also acceptable to him and to the Police Union. It had always been the practice for the Cabinet to endorse the Police Commissioner's recommendation for his assistant. In this case, however, they chose Terry Lewis, an inspector, who was known to be a close associate and bagman of the corrupt former Police Commissioner Francis Bischof. He was also less qualified for the position than at least 60 other men. Whitrod believed all his efforts for seven years to eradicate corruption would be undermined if the appointment went ahead, and he asked to speak to Bjelke-Petersen. However, the premier refused to see Whitrod, nor would he allow him to address the Cabinet on the matter. That night, Whitrod wrote out his resignation. Terry Lewis was then appointed Police Commissioner. Prior to leaving Queensland for Canberra, Ray Whitrod and his wife were subject to harassment and intimidation. He would have unordered taxis turning up during the night, sometimes three or four times a night, to take him to the airport. He would receive calls from strangers enquiring about his health, although he had an unlisted number. A heart specialist came to his house at three o'clock in the morning because he'd been told by police headquarters that Whitrod was having a heart attack. He had a large load of gravel he had not purchased dumped on his front garden. He became so frightened for his and his wife's safety that he took to sleeping with a revolver under his pillow. A large number of personal files, detailing police corruption, were mysteriously lost in transit between Brisbane and Canberra.
After his resignation, Whitrod taught criminology as a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Sociology at the ANU from 1977 to 1981. He had been awarded a Masters of Arts in Sociology from the ANU in 1972.
The Fitzgerald Inquiry in the 1980s revealed institutionalised corruption in Queensland during Bjelke-Petersen's time, and vindicated Whitrod's stance. Terry Lewis had been knighted, but was later stripped of his knighthood and jailed for criminal activity. The Fitzgerald Inquiry led to Bjelke-Petersen's political downfall, and he himself was charged with perjury, the case being dismissed only because of a hung jury, the foreman of which was an undeclared active member of Bjelke-Petersen's National Party.
In 1979, Ray Whitrod and his wife returned to Adelaide. He founded the Victims of Crime (now Victim Support) Service, an Australian first. Under Whitrod’s guidance, the service went on to establish itself across the nation. He taught as a Residential Scholar at the University of Adelaide from 1992 to 1995. In 1993 he began a PhD in Psychology.
Whitrod also played a significant role in forming the National Police Research Unit (now the Australasian Centre for Policing Research) in Adelaide, and the Australian Institute of Criminology. 
In retirement, his extensive community involvement included the first national presidency of the Prison After-Care Council, and membership of the South Australian Government’s Commission for the Ageing. He was also the driving force behind the establishment of the Australian Society of Victimology. 
He was a major contributor to the introduction of uniform crime statistics in Australia.
Ray Whitrod's memoirs were published as "Before I Sleep" (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, Qld). He died in 2003.
Honours.
Ray Whitrod was made a Member (MVO, later LVO) of the Royal Victorian Order in 1954. He was elevated to Commander (CVO) of the order in 1963.
He received the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in 1967. He was named Queenslander of the Year in 1972.
He was appointed a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in 1987 and in 1993 became a Companion of the order (AC). 
He was honoured with a Laudatis from the World Society of Victimology in 1994.
In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate in laws from the Australian National University. 
On 24 September 2007, Mick Keelty presented the inaugural Ray Whitrod Oration.
Personal life.
In 1938 he married Mavis, seven years his senior, who died in 2001. They had two sons and a daughter. His son and daughter-in-law, Andrew and Diane Whitrod were killed in a car crash in 2001. He was survived by his other son Ian, and his daughter Ruth.

List of Nobel laureates in Physics

The Nobel Prize in Physics () is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in physics. As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, of Germany. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, Röntgen received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2012, the prize was awarded to Serge Haroche and David J. Wineland "for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring & manipulation of individual quantum systems". The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972. One other has also won Nobel Prizes in other subjects: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911). William Lawrence Bragg is the youngest ever Nobel Laureate; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. Two women have won the prize: Maria Skłodowska-Curie and Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), which is the least of any of the original five Nobel Prizes. As of 2013, the prize has been awarded to 195 individuals. There have been six years in which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded (1916, 1931, 1934, 1940–1942).

The Perfect Pumpkin Pie

The Perfect Pumpkie Pie is a 2005 children's picture book by Denys Cazet.
Plot.
On Halloween, Mrs. Wikinson bakes a perfect pie for her grouchy husband and reminds him that when they die, there will be no pie. After she said that, her husband yells that he isn't going then. Soon after, he falls dead into his pumpkin pie. The widow buries him in the yard and moves away. Jack and his grandmother moves in and they bake a pie. The husband returns as a ghost to eat some pumpkin pie. He rejects the first, but he eats the third one and then goes underground... He comes back above the ground when he smells apple pie.
Reception.
A Publishers Weekly review says, "He rejects the first, but three's the charm, and the fellow goes back underground--until an apple pie scent wafts his way. Playful type and a mix of full-spread compositions and silhouette sequences keep a brisk pace. Youngsters will happily join in the ghost's refrain." A Kirkus Reviews review says, "No recipe, but still a mouthwatering crowd-pleaser, at Halloween or any other time." Gillian Engburg, of Booklist, reviewed the book saying, "A few sensitive kids may find Wilkerson's abrupt death upsetting, but most will delight in this rollicking, sometimes grusome Halloween story."

Bide-A-Wee Golf Course

Bide-A-Wee Golf Course is an 18-hole municipal public golf course founded by former PGA Champion Chandler Harper in 1956 located in and owned by the city of Portsmouth, Virginia.
Origins.
When the course was being designed, Harper and Fred Findlay were thinking about names for the course. Findlay recalled "when I was a boy in Scotland, I started to run away from home. My mother advised 'you had better bide-a-wee'. To a Scot, that meant 'stay a little longer or linger awhile.'"
In the spring of 1956, Harper, Ace Parker, Dizzy Dean, and Tommy Bolt participated in the Opening Day Exhibition at the course.
The course, 1956-1993.
From 1956 until 1993, Harper managed the course. It played host to the Virginia State Open four times and the World Senior Championships six times.
In 1993, Harper retired and the city of Portsmouth decided to fully renovate the facility.
The course undergoes a renovation.
The original Bide-A-Wee layout featured extremely narrow and small greens that fell off severely on the sides. Tom Clark of Ault, Clark and Associates, along with design consultant and Hampton Roads native Curtis Strange were brought in to renovate the course. The course re-opened on April 6, 1999.
The course, 1999-present.
The City of Portsmouth still owns Bide-A-Wee today.

United States Senate election in Alaska, 2004

The 2004 United States Senate election in Alaska took place on November 2, 2004 alongside other elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives, various state and local elections, and the presidential election of that year. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Anchorage, sought election to her first full term after being appointed to serve out the rest of her father's unexpired term when he resigned in December 2002 to become Governor of Alaska. Her main challenger was Democratic former Governor Tony Knowles, her father's predecessor as governor. Murkowski won by a slight margin.
Background.
Although Alaska is heavily Republican, popular opinion had swung against the Murkowski family because of a tax increase passed by Governor Frank Murkowski, Lisa Murkowski's father. In addition, many voters disapproved of apparent nepotism in the appointment of Lisa Murkowski to the Senate. Knowles, who as mentioned above preceded Frank Murkowski as governor, had enlisted extensive out-of-state support for his bid to take over Lisa Murkowski's Senate seat. However, veteran Republican Senator Ted Stevens taped advertisements warning Alaskans that electing a Democrat could result in less federal dollars for Alaska.
General election.
Campaign.
Lisa Murkowski had very low approval ratings as senator due to her father, Frank Murkowski, who at the time was the Governor of Alaska with extremely low approval ratings himself. Former Governor Tony Knowles ran against Murkowski. He ran as a Democrat who supported drilling in ANWR, in contrast to most Democrats. Ted Stevens tried to "rescue" her campaign and help her maintain her seat.

Arismendi (surname)

Arismendi is a Basque surname. The Basque people are indigenous to the area of northeast Spain and southwest France, a historical region known as the Basque Country. Arismendi means "mountain of oaks"; "aris" meaning "oak" and "mendi" meaning "mountain."
History.
A branch of the family immigrated to Latin America. One of the first to do so was probably Juan Bernardo de Arismendi, who was from Fuenterrabía, Spain. He immigrated to present-day Venezuela, and was commander of the fortress in Araya during the second half of the 17th century. Through him, the Arismendi family became one of the most prominent families in Venezuela, and many historical figures in Venezuelan history derive from the family.

Nabi Samwil

An-Nabi Samwil also al-Nabi Samuil ( "an-Nabi Samu'il", translit: "the prophet Samuel") is a Palestinian village of nearly 220 inhabitants in the West Bank, within the Jerusalem Governorate, located four kilometers north of Jerusalem. The village consists of a few houses and in addition to serving worshipers, its mosque acts as a prominent landmark.
Geography.
Nabi Samwil is situated atop of a mountain, 890 meters above sea level, four kilometers north of the Jerusalem neighborhood Shuafat and southwest of Ramallah in the Seam Zone. Nearby localities include Beit Iksa to the south, al-Jib to the north, Beit Hanina to the east and Biddu to the west. The village consists of 1,592 dunams of which only dunams are built-up.
History.
Early period.
The village is traditionally held to contain the tomb of the prophet Samuel (Arabic: "Nabi Samwil"), from which the village receives its name. The tomb is draped by cloth and is located in a dark cellar in Nabi Samwil's large turreted mosque. A monastery was built by the Byzantines at Nabi Samwil, serving as a hostel for Christian pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. The monastery was restored and enlarged during the reign of Justinian I in the mid-6th-century CE. Since then, the site has been a place of pilgrimage for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. The tomb continued to be in use throughout the early Arab period of rule in Palestine from the 7th to 10th centuries. 
Jerusalem-born geographer al-Muqaddasi recounted in 985 CE, a story which he had heard from his uncle concerning the place: A certain Sultan wanted to take possession of the Dayr Shamwil, which he describes as a village about a "farsakh" from Jerusalem. The Sultan asked the owner to describe the village, at which the owner enumerated the ills of the place ("hard is the labour,/the profit is low./Weeds are all over,/almonds are bitter,/one bushel you sow,/one bushel you reap;") After hearing this the ruler exclaimed "Begone! We have no need for your village!" 13th-century Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, describes ""Mar Samwil"" or ""Maran Samwil"" as a "a small town in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. Mar in Syriac signifies "al-Kass", 'the priest', and Samwil is the name of the Doctors of Law." During Islamic times, Nabi Samwil became center for pottery production, supplying nearby Jerusalem, as well as Ramla and Caesarea.
In 1099, the Crusaders conquered Palestine from the Arab Fatimids and received their first view of Jerusalem from the mountain on which Nabi Samwil is built upon, thus naming it "Mont de Joie" ("Mountain of Joy"). They soon constructed a fortress there to fend off Muslim raiding of Jerusalem's northern approaches as well as to shelter pilgrim convoys. A 6th-century Christian author identified the site as Samuel's burial place, and it has been traditionally been associated as such by Jews, Christians and Muslims. According to the Bible, however, the prophet is buried at his hometown, Ramah, to the east of the hill which is located near Geba while this site is identified as Mizpah in Benjamin. As Judas Machabeus, preparing for war with the Syrians, gathered his men "to Maspha, over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel". The 12th-century Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela visited the site when he traveled the land in 1173, noting that the Crusaders had found the bones of Samuel in a Jewish cemetery in Ramla on the coastal plain and reburied here, overlooking the Holy City. He wrote that a church dedicated to St. Samuel of Shiloh had been built on the hill. This may refer to the abbey church of St. Samuel built by Premonstratensian canons and inhabited from 1141 to 1244.
In 1157, they constructed a church at Samuel's tomb. The Crusader church was incorporated into the village mosque, built in 1730 under the Ottoman Empire. King Baldwin II of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem entrusted Nabi Samwil to Cistercians religious order, who built a monastery there and then handed it over to the Premonstratensians in the 1120s. After the Ayyubids under Saladin conquered much of interior Palestine in 1187, the church and monastery were turned into a mosque and since then remained in Muslim hands. in 1192, Richard the Lionheart reached Nabi Samwil, but did not take it. In the later Middle Ages, during the Mamluk period, Christian pilgrims continued to visit the site, including the traveller known as John Mandeville, and Margery Kempe.
In the 15th-century, Jews built a synagogue adjacent to the mosque and resumed pilgrimages to the site after losing that privilege during the Crusader era. In the 16th-century, the Jews were forced to give up some of their privileges there, but by the 18th-century Jewish pilgrimage to Nabi Samwil was restored. Mujir ad-Din referring to Jerusalem's size writes "From the north it reaches the village wherein is the tomb of the prophet Shamwil, may Allah bless him and give him peace."
Modern era.
Nabi Samwil was heavily damaged by Turkish shells in 1917 while fighting British forces, but the village was rebuilt and resettled in 1921. The Ottoman mosque which was destroyed was restored by the Supreme Muslim Council during the British Mandate era. On April 23, 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, a Palmach division attacked Nabi Samwil with the intention of capturing the village for Israel. The operation failed, since its local defenders had been notified that nearby Beit Iksa was attacked and thus, prepared for a Jewish assault. Over 40 Palmach troops were killed in the battle with minimal Arab casualties. 
From 1948 to 1967, Nabi Samwil was used by the Arab Legion of Jordan as a military post guarding access to Jerusalem, until it was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War. Throughout the 1970s, most houses in the village were demolished by the Israeli authorities. Nabi Samwil became part of Area C after the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), stipulating full Israeli control over the village. Since the mid-2000s, Nabi Samwil became part of an area known as the "Seam Zone", which denotes the land between the separation barrier (erected during the Second Intifada) and the borders of Jerusalem municipality. 
The village, which is not recognized as such by Israel, was designated as a national park in the 1990s and the remains of former homes adjacent to the mosque form part of an archaeological site in the park. The mosque has been cordoned off and the section containing Samuel's tomb has been converted into a synagogue. Partly due to Israeli military restrictions, Palestinian construction in the village is banned. Economic activity is also significantly restricted and residents live in poverty, with many young residents leaving for jobs in nearby Ramallah. Israel states its policies are intended to preserve the site of Nabi Samwil.
Demographics.
In 1922 Nabi Samwil had 121 inhabitants, rising to 138 in 1931. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey in 1945 200 people resided there. By 1981 the number dropped to 66 inhabitants but was up to 136 within five years. According to the 2007 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Nabi Samwil had a population of 258 inhabitants in 2007. About 20 Muslim families live there. A group of 90 Bedouins living in al-Jib who had been evicted from Nabi Samwil were refused permission to move back because the village lies in Area C and it would be difficult for them to acquire building permits.

Richard Meredith (bishop)

Richard Meredith (sometimes Meredyth) (died 3 August 1597) was the Church of Ireland Bishop of Leighlin from 1589 until his death.
Life.
Meredith, descended from Gruffydd ap Cynan, was from Denbighshire, Wales. He was the son of Robert Meredith of Llanafan Fawr and the nephew of George Smith, Chancellor of St. Asaph. He was educated at the University of Oxford, matriculating in 1568 and obtaining degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in 1573 and 1575 respectively from Jesus College, Oxford. In 1578, he was prebendary at Brecon collegiate church and the rector of Barton, Pembrokeshire; in the following year, he became vicar of his native Llanafan Fawr in Brecknockshire and in 1580 the rector of Nangle, Pembrokeshire, and prebendary of St David's Cathedral, where his father's first cousin, Richard Davies, was bishop. 
In the same year as his marriage he was appointed chaplain to Sir John Perrot, Lord Deputy of Ireland and Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was appointed Bishop of Leighlin in 1589 (but not also, as is sometimes thought, Bishop of Ferns; the two sees not being merged until after his death). Meredith continued as Dean of St Patrick's, given the poverty of his diocese. He was accused of treasonous correspondence once Perrot had returned to England in 1588, but Meredith showed the evidence to be forgeries. His support for Perrot led to his imprisonment in the Fleet Prison and an appearance before the Star Chamber, leading to a fine of £2,000 (later remitted in return for an annual payment to the queen of 300 marks for 10 years). He was in ill-health by 1593 and died in 1597; he was buried in St Patrick's.
In 1584, he married Sarah Bathoe (d.1650), who re-married Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus after his death. Their elder son, Sir Robert Meredith (1585–1668) M.P., was Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer; ancestor of the Baronets of Greenhills and Shrowland, Co. Kildare. Their younger son, Sir Thomas Meredith (d.1677), was the Member of Parliament for Old Leighlin, Co. Carlow, and ancestor of the Baronets of Dollardstown, Newtown and Carlandstown, Co. Meath. A large monument in black and White marble stands in the North Transept of St. Patrick's Cathedral to Bishop Meredith.

National Museum of Patriotism

The National Museum of Patriotism was a museum in Atlanta, Georgia, at its peak occupying a 10,000-square foot site on Spring Street in Midtown Atlanta. However it closed in 2010 and moved to an online-only presence. The founder of the museum was Nicholas Snider, a retired United Parcel Service executive who created a large collection of sweetheart jewelry.
History.
It was originally founded by Nicholas D. Snider, a former vice-president of United Parcel Service. There have been questions concerning Mr. Snider's role in financing the museum. Although claiming to have donated large sums of money to the museum, tax records indicate that his donations were actually personal loans to the museum which he approved as the museum's chief executive. As of 2011, the museum owed Mr. Snider $498,181. It was located in Atlanta, Georgia, opening in premises at 1405 Spring Street on July 4, 2004, and in 2007 moving to a site at 275 Baker St, in the Centennial Olympic Park near the Georgia Aquarium and The World of Coca-Cola. Jim Balster was the museum's first executive director, followed by Jim Stapleton, and then Pat Stansbury. It was during Stansbury's tenure that the museum declined and eventually closed.
In April 2009, the Patriotism in Entertainment and Music exhibit was opened in a ceremony attended by Kenny Gamble and Patti LaBelle. At the same time, the museum inaugurated its Patriot Award: recipients including LaBelle and Gamble, Lee Greenwood, Cowboy Crush, The Bob Hope Foundation, and Access Hollywood.
Closure.
In July 2010, the museum was forced to close due to mismanagement by senior leadership. To save face, the museum rebranded itself as the 'The National Foundation Of Patriotism' and promised a revolutionary online virtual museum, which never happened. In order to pay creditors, the museum auctioned off all of its exhibits and artifacts. Some of the items auctioned off were actually items that were on loan to the museum.

Inertance

Inertance is a measure of the pressure difference in a fluid required to cause a change in flow-rate with time. The base SI units of inertance are kg m−4 or Pa m−3 s2 and the usual symbol is I. 
The inertance of a tube is given by:
where
The pressure difference is related to the change in flow-rate by the equation:
where
This equation assumes constant density, that the acceleration is uniform, and that the flow is fully developed "plug flow". This precludes sharp bends, water hammer, and so on.
To some, it may appear counterintuitive that an increase in cross-sectional area of a tube reduces the inertance of the tube. However, for the same mass flow-rate, a lower cross-sectional area implies a higher fluid velocity and therefore a higher pressure difference to accelerate the fluid.
In respiratory physiology, inertance (of air) is measured in cmH2O L−1 s2.
1 cmH2O L−1 s2 ≈ 98100 Pa m−3 s2.
Using small-signal analysis, an inertance can be represented as a fluid reactance through the relation:

Calixto Catáquiz

Calixto R. Catáquiz (born December 29, 1948) is the former mayor of San Pedro, Laguna, Philippines. He is also a businessman and banker, and once managed the Laguna Lake Development Authority from 2001 to 2003.
Early life and education.
Calixto Catáquiz was born in Manila. His parents were Rodolfo C. Catáquiz of Unisan, Quezon, and Rosa T. Ramírez of San Pedro, Laguna. His parents were the pioneers of the "balút" industry in San Pedro. Calex, as his family members and friends call him, grew up in his mother's hometown. He was an only child from an affluent family.
Catáquiz had his elementary education first in San Pedro Central Elementary School (1959–1961), then he transferred to Canossa School of Santa Rosa, Laguna (1961–1965).
He spent his high school and college days in San Beda College, Manila where he took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce (Management).
After graduation.
After his studies, Catáquiz assisted his parents in their various businesses. He became the bank manager of Entrepreneur Bank (Rural Bank of Unisan) which his father had founded in the latter's hometown of Unisan, Quezon. Back in his hometown of San Pedro, he founded the Sampaguita Savings Bank at age 30, but eventually sold Sampaguita Savings Bank to a family from Muntinlupa.
Political career.
According to Mayor Catáquiz, he never really had any intention at all to run for any public office. He was just prodded by the people of San Pedro, particularly former Mayor José L. Amante, to run against then incumbent Mayor Felicísimo Vierneza during the 30 January 1980 Philippine Elections. He lost during his first foray into Philippine politics.
During the 1986 People Power Revolution, he led San Pedro's delegation of the Justice for Aquino, Justice for All (JAJA), funding the participants with his own money (for food, transportation, and other protest rally materials). His association with the opposition brought him into a misunderstanding with none other but his parents, who were known close friends of former dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos.
Due to his participation in EDSA, the leaders of the newly installed president Corazón C. Aquino's Revolutionary Government appointed him as the Officer In Charge of San Pedro, replacing Vierneza. It was not an easy ascent into power because Mayor Vierneza, like most local chief executives at that time, refused to go down, believing that Aquino's revolutionary government was illegal. Thus, a forced takeover ensued wherein Catáquiz supporters clashed with Vierneza's men.
Mayor Catáquiz served as San Pedro's OIC from 1986 to 1988. During the 1988 Philippine elections, he was elected into office for the first time. He remained in power until 1998.
In 2001, he was seen once again in the second People Power Revolution at EDSA. Upon Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's appointment as President of the Philippines, Catáquiz was tasked to head the Laguna Lake Development Authority.
As LLDA General Manager, he was able to make Laguna de Bay a member of the Living Lakes of the World.
2007 saw him once again as San Pedro's mayor. He was re-elected as mayor on the 2010 elections.

Germany–India relations

The bilateral relations between the Republic of India and the Federal Republic of Germany have been traditionally strong due to strong commercial, cultural and strategic co-operation.
Germany and India's continues to be largest trading partner in Europe. Germany is currently the 8th largest foreign direct investor in India. Germany's FDI totaled about 5.2 billion USD during the period 2000-2012, constituting about 3% of total FDI to India. Indian investments in Germany have seen sharp increase in last few years.
History.
India was the first nation to end the state of war with Germany after the Second World War. Unlike many other countries who forced compensation or reparations after the Second World War against German people, India waived all its compensation rights. A great number of Indian soldiers had been killed in the Second World War in fighting Nazis as allied troops. This was to lessen the burden on the German people as their country had been reduced to a rubble and there was little food for Germans to eat after the collapse of Third Reich.
After a spell in Argentina, aircraft designer Kurt Tank, who worked for Focke-Wulf during World War II, moved to India. First he worked as Director of the Madras Institute of Technology, and later joined Hindustan Aeronautics, where he designed the Hindustan Marut fighter-bomber, the first military aircraft constructed in India. Tank left Hindustan Aeronautics in 1967 and by the 1970s had returned to live in Berlin.
India maintained diplomatic relations with both West Germany and East Germany but supported their reunification in 1990.
According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 13% of Germans view India's influence positively, with 50% expressing a negative view, and about 27% Indians had positive view for Germany.
Development of bilateral ties.
Germany has extensively supported education and cultural development in India. Germany helped establish the Indian Institute of Technology Madras after both governments signed an agreement in 1956 and increased its co-operation and supply of technology and resources over the decades to help expand the institution.
In 2008, both nations established the Indo-German Science and Technology Centre in New Delhi to promote joint research and development in energy, environment, coal and water technologies. Germany is India's largest European trading partner and the 5th largest trade partner. Current trade volume stands at €10.5 billion in 2006, € 12.7 billion in 2007-08 and both nations see it increasing to €30 billion by 2010. India and Germany enjoy strong commerce and co-operation in telecommunications, engineering, environmental technology, food processing, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
Strategic ties.
In the 1990s, Germany condemned India's 1998 nuclear tests, but has since expanded its co-operation with India in fighting terrorism and conducting joint military exercises. Germany has also supported India's waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group to trade nuclear materials and energy. In 2008, the Indian Navy and the German Navy conducted joint exercises for the first time, following a defence co-operation agreement between the two nations signed in 2006. India has 
so far launched seven German satellites into Polar orbits since 1999.
Political relations.
India and Germany are together in seeking a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council.
Bilateral visits.
In 2008, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made an official visit to India that led to the signing of several agreements expanding bilateral co-operation in commerce, science, technology and defence.
In 2014, on the occasion of the visit of the President of Germany Joachim Gauck to India, two Umbrella Agreements respectively for financial and technical cooperation under Indo-German bilateral Development Cooperation were signed . The Umbrella Agreements were signed by P.Chidambaram, Finance Minister of India and Dr Gerd Mueller, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany during the meeting between the two ministers .The Government of Germany committed funds amounting to Euro 1.09 billion, which is highest ever commitment so far since 1958. The Umbrella Agreement on Financial Cooperation pertains to concessional loans from Government of Germany for nine projects namely Himalaya Hydro power Programme (HPPCL), Green Energy Corridors, Promotional Programme for Energy Efficient New Residential Housing-II (NHB), Energy Efficiency in Thermal Power Plants (WBPDCL), Affordable Housing Programme (NHB), New Approaches in Microfinance and Microenterprise Finance (SIDBI), Missing Middle Programme (SIDBI), Madhya Pradesh Urban Sanitation and Environment Programme and Himachal Pradesh Forest Ecosystems Climate Proofing Project.

Loon Mountain Ski Resort

Loon Mountain Ski Resort is a ski resort in Lincoln, Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. It is in the White Mountain National Forest. Its vertical drop of is the tenth largest in New England. It is located on Loon Mountain.
Loon Mountain hosts more skiers than any other resort in the state. In the fall Loon Mountain has hosted the New Hampshire Highland Games for many years, and has more visitors in the summer than in the winter.
Loon has twelve ski lifts: one four-passenger gondola, three detachable quad chairs, one fixed-grip quad chair, three fixed-grip double chairs, one fixed-grip triple chair and three surface lifts. The area has 53 trails covering skiable. Terra Mesa Resort properties, a MacFarlan Capital Partners Company, is building a real estate development at the base of South Peak. In the following years the new home and condo sites will be connected to the ski area with new trails and lifts.
On September 19, 2007, Boyne Resorts, a Michigan-based resort company, announced it had acquired the lease to operate Loon from Booth Creek Ski Holdings. In December of the same year, the new South Peak opened with three new trails, one new detachable quad chair lift, and a fixed-grip quad chair lift connecting the South Peak to the main ski area. In 2008-2009 Loon opened two more trails on South Peak including Ripsaw, an expert slope originally cut in 1996 but never finished because of delays in the permitting process, and Escape Route, a winding, secluded trail leading only to the South Peak Parking lot with no lift service. In the early Spring of 2009 Loon started removing trees for more expert trails parallel to Ripsaw. These new routes, named Jobber, Upper Twitcher and Lower Twitcher were completed for the 2011-2012 winter season. Their addition completes the current permitted South Peak expansion.
On the Octagon Lodge Side new in 2011-2012 are two terrain parks. A new trail parallel to Grand Junction called Dropline will host smaller terrain elements for beginners. A second new park for intermediates, Springboard, takes over the former home of recreational racing, Race City. For the 2011-2012 season recreational racing was relocated to Lower Rum Runner.

Bachelors Barge Club

Bachelors Barge Club is an amateur rowing club located at #6 Boathouse Row in the historic Boathouse Row of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is the oldest continuously operating boathouse in the United States. It went through renovations as part of the "Light Boathouse Row" initiative, in which new LED lights were fitted to each of the boathouses. Bachelors Barge Club is currently home to several programs, including the Conestoga High School Crew Team, and the Drexel University Crew Team, among several others.
Founding.
The founding fathers of Bachelors Barge Club were members of the Phoenix Engine Company, a volunteer fire-fighting organization. Initially, membership was limited to bachelors, however the Club opened its doors to married men shortly after its founding. Membership at the club has risen considerably since the early 1980s when the Club counted only 10 members. Now, the majority of Bachelors Barge Club's 150 members are women.
Israel W. Morris, a prominent iron merchant and philanthropist, is credited with founding the Club. He was also elected as its second president. Other prominent Old Philadelphian 19th century industrialist members include Charles F. Berwind (coal), William Weightman (chemicals), Maxwell Wyeth (pharmaceuticals), Charles E. Mather (insurance), W. Atlee Burpee (seeds and plants), Clarkson Clothier (retailing) and J. B. Lippincott (publishing).
Members of Bachelors Barge Club won Olympic medals for the single and the four in 1924, the single in 1928, and the double in the 1932. More recently, Cody Lowry was named to the 2009 US National Team to row in the Lightweight Men's Single Sculls.
The Boathouse.
Bachelors Barge Club occupied several boathouse in succession before 1860, when it built a stone building.
In 1884, architects Edward Harlehurst and Samuel Huckel, Jr. designed the Club's social up-river house in East Falls, the Bachelor's Button. The two architects had teamed up in 1881, and maintained a 20 year partnership that produced residential and ecclesiastical architecture including the Union Methodist Church and the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church.
In 1893, the Fairmount Park Commission allowed the Club to replace its 1860 building. In 1894, construction was finished on the Mediterranean-style boathouse at #6 Boathouse Row, which was also designed by the Harlehurst and Huckel team. Huckel became a member of Bachelors after designing its boathouse. Today, the building remains relatively unchanged.
Wharton Crew.
The several organizations that row out of Bachelors include the Wharton Crew Team, which is the rowing team for Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. All other University of Pennsylvania crews row out of College Boat Club. Wharton Crew is one of the largest graduate and professional student athletic clubs at Penn. The program owns two Vespoli eight shells –– the Wharton Journal and the Russell Palmer. In 1997, team member and co-captain, John Hall, broke the world record in the master's lightweight 2000 meter ergometer.

Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag

Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag ("Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB" or simply "HVA", ) was a Swedish firearms manufacturing company in the town of Huskvarna by lake Vättern.
History.
In 1689 the manager at the nearby state arsenal in Jönköping, Erik Dahlbergh, suggested to the King that the crown should support the construction of a new milling work at the waterfalls just outside Huskvarna. The new work should act as a branch of the Jönköping arsenal, where water supply had become irregular. The plans were approved and put into work the same year. Thanks to the Husqvarna branch, the annual production of barrels for muskets from the Jönköping arsenal increased from about 1,500 to over 12,000.
Eventually all production was moved to Huskvarna and in 1757 the arsenal was privatized under the ownership of Fredrik Ehrenpreus. In 1867 the company became a limited company under the name Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag.
When military orders dropped after the Danish-Prussian War of 1864 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, Husqvarna begun making shotguns and hunting rifles. They also started manufacturing stoves, sewing machines and bicycles. In 1903 Husqvarna made their first motorcycle. The firearms production continued though. However, except during the two world wars and some shorter periods of military production Husqvarna mainly manufactured civilian firearms.
In the late 1960s it was decided that Husqvarna should stop making break-action firearms and sell both the rifle production and military contracts to Carl Gustaf in Eskilstuna.
Civilian firearms.
Husqvarna made numerous types and models of break action shotguns. 
The first medium caliber bolt action rifles used the same action as the Swedish Army's Mauser m/96. This type was manufactured from 1927 to 1942 circa, known as the Model 46 and mostly chambered in 6.5x55, 9.3x57 and 9.3x62 mm.
from early 1939 Husqvarna started purchasing Mauser M98 actions from the Belgian company FN, labeling the rifles Model 146, 246 and 640. Though the M98 was a strong and well proven action, it was not an ideal situation for Husqvarna to be depending on one of its worst competitors for such a key component.
An independent bolt action design was introduced in 1953 as the 1600-series, which was available in several European and American chamberings, including 9.3x62, .270, 30-06; 8x57, 6.5x55, and others.
With the army order for the Ak 4 the company was able to find the funding to re-tool the workshop to produce a newly developed bolt action, marketed in 1967 as the 1900-series and continued by FFV well into the 1980s. 
Husqvarna also built a limited number of an elegant double rifle in caliber 9.3x74R, the model 410.

January (novel)

January is the first book in the Countdown series by Daniel Parker (b. 1970). It was first published on December 1, 1998.
Plot.
The book is divided into four parts, the Prologue, Part I that contains chapters one through five, Part II that contains chapters six through twelve, and Part III that contains chapters thirteen through fifteen.
Prologue.
The series starts on January 1, 1999 in a Russian military installation north of the Arctic Circle, five minutes before the countdown to the year 1999 in the Pacific Time Zone. In the midst of a toast inside, the base is suddenly attacked by a very mysterious group of female teenagers. With the stationed soldiers dead, secret weapons contained in the base are launched.
Part I.
The series starts with a Prologue on January 1, 1999 in a Russian military installation north of the Arctic Circle, five minutes before the countdown to the year 1999 in the Pacific Time Zone. In the midst of a toast inside, the base is suddenly attacked by a very mysterious group of female teenagers. With the stationed soldiers dead, secret weapons contained in the base are launched.
The first chapter introduces seventeen-year-old Ariel Collins, Jezebel Howe, Brian Landau, and Trevor Collins in Washington, USA. Just two seconds before the end of 1998, a solar flare occurs, resulting in a power outage.
The plot then moves to New York City, introducing characters Julia Morrison and her boyfriend Luke at a nightclub. At 3:01 AM, about a minute after the secret weapons are launched, Julia, in the midst of watching her boyfriend dancing with someone else finds that the music abruptly stops and the lights turn off. Strange things begin happening, and Julie receives a mysterious vision. She wakes up to find that the person next to her has disappeared and has left a puddle of what seemed to be wet putty.
Moving on, the book introduces twenty-year-old Dr. Harold Wurf in a hospital in Austin, Texas, where he is on a New Year's thirty-two hour shift. Seven minutes after the launch of the weapons, the hospital, University of Texas Hospital still has power. He decides to check up on an attractive patient he's forgotten about. After a tedious conversation, the patient tells him that she feels very hot and needs some water and suddenly develops strange symptoms. But soon enough, she melts into a black puddle before his eyes. Harold Wurf is consumed by terror, and runs out of the room only to find out that absolutely everyone has vanished, leaving articles of clothes and thick black puddles.
At last the plot moves to Jerusalem, Israel, introducing eighteen-year-old atheist Sarah Levy who decided to study in Israel and her brother Joshua Levy on a bus with their granduncle Elijah. Ten minutes after the launch, and after learning about the sudden blackouts of major cities around the world, Sarah is left with a bus filled with silent prayer. A radio reports that there has apparently been a massive solar flare. Elijah suddenly begins babbling about a prophecy on a scroll but becomes ill and sure enough, disintegrates into a black puddle. With everyone except for Sarah and her brother reduced to piles of blood, pus, blackness and clothing, the bus becomes out of control.
Meanwhile, back in Washington, fifteen minutes into the new year, as the four teenagers begin suspecting the launch of a nuclear war caused the outages, Ariel's ill tempered father comes back to their house early. Entering, he finds a large supply of empty beers and four drunk teens. He begins to throw a fit when he suddenly collapses. Sure enough, he melts into a puddle.
Part II.
After nearly twenty-four hours of unconsciousness, Sarah wakes up in a crash yard, nearby the bus she was on, with her brother taking care of her. Josh believes the world is falling apart, but Sarah have a very hard time believing him.
Chapter seven introduces punk-like George Porter and very obese Eight Ball, two sixteen-year-olds jailed for hot-wiring a car on New Year's Eve. Three days after any adult over twenty disintegrates, the two are found starving and thirsty in a jail cell, on the verge of cannibalistic ideas. Out of anger, George kicks the hard metal cell door, cracking a few bones in his right foot and loosening a screw. While in immense pain, Eight Ball manages to knock out the screw from its place and squeeze through the door. But instead of helping George through the door, Eight Ball runs off.
In the midst of a fight between Julia and her drunk boyfriend in their New York City apartment, Julia acts on impulse and runs away from him. She only makes it to the bottom floor when she is confronted with three 'love' searching thugs. Luke manages to catch up to her with a bottle of booze. After a negative conversation, Luke fatally bashes one of the three with the bottle. He then decides that they should leave the city and go west, where Julie wanted to go anyway, even though Luke thinks her visions are 'pretty wild.'
Back in Texas, Harold finds himself extremely overloaded with teenage medical issues, barely having received more than a trinkle of sleep over the past week. After a few quickly solved cases, the teenagers start believing he has the magical power to heal. Harold realizes that there isn't much he can do to make them believe otherwise, so he just goes with it.

Fiction Family (album)

Fiction Family is the debut studio album by the collaboration between Switchfoot frontman and solo artist Jon Foreman and Nickel Creek guitarist and solo artist Sean Watkins. It was released January 20, 2009 through the indie record label, ATO Records.
Production.
History and Recording.
Foreman and Watkins began their collaboration in 2005, and eventually pieced together their first song called "Betrayal". The pair continued to write songs in the same manner because Nickel Creek and Switchfoot were both constantly on the road touring. "Whoever was home from tour would chip away at the songs with no real expectations at all," said Foreman. It was "mainly just for ourselves and for the love of the song I suppose."
The tracking of the record was very organic, with little production involved besides some basic samples the two created from scratch. It was recorded completely in Foreman and Watkins' home studios, and with a few exceptions, "every note was written, arranged, played, recorded, mixed, and mastered by Sean and myself," Foreman said.
"A lot of our sessions consisted of playing new songs that we’d written or songs that we’d learned and then saying, ‘That’s really good’ or ‘I don’t really like that one’ or ‘I like the chorus on that one, but maybe we could write a new verse,’" said Watkins about the experience of writing with Foreman.
Music and lyrical content.
Watkins and Foreman's writing methods were varied, but most of the time, Watkins would come up with a melody and Foreman would write the lyrics. "There’s a few songs where I just gave him the melody idea and he wrote all the words over it," said Watkins. "A couple times, there were some lyrical collaborations but it was more about what sounded better and less about content."
Regardless of contribution, the credits for the writing of all original songs were split between Foreman and Watkins evenly. Songwriting credits are listed neither in the liner notes nor on any website.
The album also contains a cover of "Throw It Away", written by singer Abbey Lincoln. "On that one, he’d (Foreman) learned it and I hadn’t heard the original one yet at all," said Watkins of their recording process for the song. "He played it and I thought it was great, just a good song with a great arrangement. We added a couple things to it and used it."
The pair switched roles between the songwriter and the producer throughout the project. "The second song we did together, called 'Out of Order,' (Sean) pretty much wrote on his own and I provided more of the producer role," Foreman says. "When one of us was producing the song, it allowed the other to dive more into the artistic elements of the song."
Distribution.
Eventually, the pair had pulled together enough songs for an EP, but enjoyed the project so much they decided to continue writing until they had a full record. They finished tracking in 2007, and rumors were swirling that Starbucks Coffee would be releasing the record on their label. But that deal apparently fell through, and the album was shelved until ATO Records picked it up late in 2008.
Reception.
Critical reception.
The album has been well received amongst many review publications. Relevant Magazine calls the project "wildly inventive and spontaneous... the work stands in victorious defiance against a crumbling conventional music industry." JFH praises the diversity of the record, saying "each song is meticulously crafted, and strikingly different from the eleven other songs on the record." Silent Sound Waves likened Foreman's and Watkins' efforts to what "put The Beatles and The Eagles on the map."
Sales and charts.
The album entered the Billboard 200 at number 71, selling 7000 copies in the first week of its release. It was well received at online retail sites, as well, reaching as high as No. 5 on iTunes' top overall albums on its first day of release.

John Ogden (photographer)

John Ogden is a photographer, cinematographer, writer and publisher, whose wide ranging career has encompassed producing television commercials, international documentary making, music video production, drama, and fine art photography. Not to be confused with UK based Photographer and Educationalist John Ogden who changed his name and can now be found at www.johnrae.co.uk.
Nicknamed 'Oggy', Ogden is South Australian born and of Anglo-Irish descent, Recent family research suggests there may also be Palawa heritage. He has worked all over the world, his projects spanning diverse cultures and nations including SE Asia, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Europe, South America, the USA, and indigenous Australia. His work with imagery assiociated with Australian Aborigines resulted in the books 'Australienation' (1999), and 'Portraits From A Land Without People', released in 2009 to coincide with the first anniversary of Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd's apology to the Aboriginal people.
Early career.
Ogden began his career as a photo-journalist, and continued his personal development by completing an English degree, with a focus on Film history and theory After graduating in 1979, Ogden began his career in filmmaking and advertising.
Work in Film and Documentary.
Ogden credits his documentary filmmaking experience with giving him a good sense of natural lighting, as well as the invaluable experience of witnessing how real people behave in a variety of situations. Notable credits include work as Director of Photography on 'As Time Goes By', Bad Boy Bubby (second-unit, 1993) and Mission Impossible (second-unit, 1988–89). His short film 'House of Sticks' (2011) was screened at Flickerfest (Bondi), Hollyshorts (LA) and several other festivals.
Music video.
Having acted as Director of Photography on over 50 music videos, Ogden has worked with many major artists including Prince, INXS, and Split Enz. In an interview with the ABC in 2007, he recounted the challenge of filming a video directed by Prince, having signed a contract which expressly prohibited conversation with the artist. Ogden credits working in this medium as teaching innovation.
Fine art photography.
Since 2006 Ogden's work has focused on series' of fine art photography, and extensive work with Aboriginal Australian imagery. His publishing company, Cyclops Press, began production with 'Australienation' in 1999. Partly inspired by a conversation in which Ogden was upbraided whilst in England in his youth, criticising the near genocide of the Aboriginal populations by the colonial immigrants, and subsequent culture clash, Ogden's 2008/9 work 'Portraits From A Land Without People' is considered to be the most comprehensive pictorial history of the Aboriginal people of Australia produced, honoring fully the Aboriginal cultural code which requires permission to be granted by each individual in every picture. To compile the book, and gain the appropriate permissions, Ogden travelled extensively over a four-year period, examining over 300,000 images, and visiting public libraries, galleries, museums and private collections in every state and territory in Australia. Ogden has described the dedication necessary to complete this task as a 'beautiful obsession'.
In November 2011 Ogden released 'Saltwater People of the Broken Bays – Sydney's Northern Beaches', and in November 2012 released the companion book 'Saltwater People of the Fatal Shore – Sydney's South-side Beaches'. 'Slightly Dangerous – The Cyclops' Cypher', released in May 2013, provides an insight into the inspirations and influences behind Ogden's work. In his foreword to 'Slightly Dangerous', photographer Tim Page writes: “This is a life well travelled, of a baby boomer who surfs an existential path across six decades, waxing the best of nostalgia against the odds that are self mitigated by the excesses of those times. It is a heritage of the hippest, most gonzo ‘down-under’ attitudes, rendered by images we all wish we had snapped. As if Hunter S. Thompson and Richard Neville shuffled photo cards with Robert Frank’ian images throughout the deck”.

Hugh Kearney

Hugh F. Kearney (born 1924, Liverpool, United Kingdom) is a British historian, and Amundson Professor Emeritus of the University of Pittsburgh. He is the author of several articles on early modern economic history, a biography on Thomas Wentworth, and the acclaimed book "British Isles: A History of Four Nations" which advocated a multi-national, "Britannic" approach, rather than an Anglo-centric approach to their history, historiography and sociology. His daughter is "The World at One" presenter Martha Kearney.
Career.
After a period teaching at University College Dublin, in 1962 Kearney became one of the first academics (a lecturer of history) at the still-under-construction 'plate glass university', University of Sussex, where he taught at a temporary Nissen hut before the arts faculty buildings were completed. Kearney went on to teach courses on contemporary Britain; poetry, science and religion in seventeenth century England; religion and literature in the age of Pascal, and the politics and literature of Yeats and Joyce. Kearney made modern Irish history his major research interest, especially focusing on Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom, and the British nations. 
While at Sussex, Kearney spent three months at the Folger Library in Washington D.C., where he wrote an article "Puritanism, Capitalism and the Scientific Revolution" (published in Past and Present, 1964). During his time at Sussex, he also took a sabbatical in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
In 1970 Kearney left Sussex to become Richard Pares Professor of history at the University of Edinburgh, and in 1975 moved on to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was Amundson Professor of British History until 1999. His is now Amundson Professor Emeritus. 
While at Sussex, Kearney edited "Problems and Perspectives in History" (a series published by Longmans) in which he contributed the volume "Origins of the Scientific Revolution". As result of this, he came to contribute a volume in the new World University Library ("Science and Change 1500-1700", Weidenfeld, 1970) that was translated into German, Spanish and Japanese. 
In 1969 Kearney contributed three chapters on the 17th century in John Cruikshank's Sussex-based series "French Literature and its Background". Kearney further published his work on 17th century universities in "Scholars and Gentlemen: Universities and Society in Pre-Industrial Britain" (Faber 1970). 
A gap of almost 20 years followed before the publication of his later works, "The British Isles: A History of Four Nations" (1989, 2006) and the collection of essays, "Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History" (2007).
Works.
The British Isles: A History of Four Nations.
In 1989 Kearney published "The British Isles: A History of Four Nations", to strong reviews in the Times Literary Supplement, History Today, The Spectator and the New York Review of Books. It was printed by the Cambridge University Press as a general reader book with plate sections in hardback and paperback, and the Canto edition of 1995, which had an extended bibliography, was reprinted twice. A second edition was published by Cambridge in 2006, which included a new chapter on the nineties and post-devolution Britain.
Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History.
In 2007 Kearney cast his 'Britannic' perspective on Ireland in a collection of essays published by the New York University Press currently only available in the USA, in its first hardback edition. According to the New York University Press, "Kearney contends that Ireland represents a striking example of the power of nationalism" and offers "his revisionist 'four nations' approach to Irish history."
In the media.
In 2006, Kearney reminisced with his daughter about life amongst the development of Sussex University, in a BBC Radio Four series charting the post-war history of higher education.

Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council

Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court on October 8, 2008 concerning the United States Navy ability to use sonar during drills causing possible harm to whales and other marine mammals.
In balancing military preparedness against environmental concerns, the majority came down solidly on the side of national security. Chief Justice Roberts wrote in his opinion, “the most serious possible injury would be harm to an unknown number of marine mammals that they study and observe.” By contrast, he continued, “forcing the Navy to deploy an inadequately trained antisubmarine force jeopardizes the safety of the fleet.”
Environmentalists contend that the sonar has a possible deafening effect on the whales. They said studies conducted around the world have shown the piercing underwater sounds cause whales to flee in panic or to dive too deeply. Whales have been found beached in Greece, the Canary Islands and in the Bahamas after sonar was used in the area, and necropsies showed signs of internal bleeding near the ears.
Background and procedural history.
The Navy scheduled 14 training exercises through January 2009 off the coast of southern California. These exercises involve the use of “mid-frequency active sonar” to detect enemy submarines. Environmentalists claim that the high decibel levels used harm whales, causing beach strandings. In February 2007, however, the Navy issued an environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), concluding that the use of mid-frequency active sonar during the exercises would cause minimal harm to marine mammals.
Petitioners, mostly environmental groups, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the exercises, on the ground that they violated NEPA, plus other environmental laws not material to the Supreme Court decision. The district court granted a preliminary injunction barring conduct of the exercises. On remand from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the district court modified the preliminary injunction to allow the Navy to use the sonar if it used mitigation measures. On the Navy’s second appeal, challenging two of the mitigation measures, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction, noting that plaintiffs (petitioners in the Supreme Court) had carried their burden of showing a “possibility” of irreparable injury and that the balance of hardships weighed in favor of plaintiffs.
Opinion of the court.
The majority opinion held that as an initial matter the Ninth Circuit’s “possibility” test for issuance of a preliminary injunction is too lenient; plaintiffs must show that irreparable injury is “likely” in the absence of an injunction. However, the Court continued, even if plaintiffs had shown irreparable injury (and, too, likelihood of success on the merits), it is “plainly outweighed” by the Navy’s interest in effective, realistic training of its sailors. That factor alone requires denial of the requested injunctive relief. For the plaintiffs, the most serious possible injury would be the loss of ability to observe an unknown number of marine mammals. In light of the foregoing, the Court reversed the decision below and vacated the preliminary injunction.
Parenthetically, said the Court, the same balancing factor requiring vacatur of the preliminary injunction here would also bear on a challenge to any future permanent injunction.
The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit—that is, whether the Navy exercises violated NEPA or the other federal environmental laws claimed to be violated.
Comments.
Excerpted from CRS Report:
The Ninth Circuit is widely regarded as an environmentally friendly circuit, and the Supreme Court, in reversing it here, was doing what it has done many times before.

Jacob D. Green

Jacob D. Green (August 24, 1813 – unknown) was a runaway slave from Kentucky that escaped three times from his masters. He escaped once in 1839 and 1846 then successfully in 1848 after being sold to a new master.
Childhood.
Jacob was born into slavery with 113 other slaves on a plantation in Kentucky with only his mother as family. Judge Charles Earle put Jacob to work at age eight running chores and giving water to the other slaves. When Jacob was twelve his mother was sold to a trader passing through Kentucky, all he said about his mother was that she was a good slave. Similar to Mr. Cobb’s saying, she said if you did what you’re told and stay out of trouble your master would treat you well. . Five years later he caught a white boy stealing from him and when they got into a fight, a man by the name of Mr. Burmey came in and broke up the fight beating Jacob and threatening to cut off his hands for hitting a white boy. This triggered a deep hatred within Jacob and when he finally got the chance, he managed to replace Mr. Burmey’s smoking tobacco with gunpowder. No one ever suspected him of the murder, and he got his satisfying revenge.
Adulthood.
In Jacob’s later years he did many “awful” things, but also made daring choices that would lead to his freedom. Jacob at one point in time stole a couple of sweet potatoes, his master found out and ordered him to deliver a letter which he was sure contained an order to lash him. Instead of going himself he found himself a loophole and got one of the other slaves to deliver the letter in his place, this caused the other man to be beat while he avoided it. However bad it was for his friendships, it certainly was beneficial to his welfare. Later (time unspecific), he left the barn door open and allowed eight of his masters horses escape on purpose. When his master questioned him later, he convinced his master that the other slaves must have done it. He was utterly convincing and his master believed him, and then set out to punish the other slaves. Although this caused Jacob personal pain for the suffering he caused his fellow slaves, he did not speak up. 
Eventually Jacob fell in love with a slave girl named Mary, who was evidently not in love with him and had another lover named Dan. Jacob told her that if she didn’t give up Dan and love him he would proceed to hang himself, Mary didn’t care. He took a rope and pretended to string himself up, standing on a stool. He tried many ways to convince her he was dying but she took no interest. When he was finally ready to give up, a dog came out of nowhere and knocked the stool out from under him. Now that he was truly hanging, and unable to free himself, he called out for help in genuine fear. She sat sadistically and watched him slowly dying. After howling and yelling eventually the strength in his arms couldn’t hold the rope off any longer and he blacked out. When he came to, Mary’s master; a doctor stood over him. He never knew who cut the rope. Shortly after this, one of Mr. Burmey’s sons forced himself on Mary. Her screams brought Dan onto the scene and without thinking, Dan plunged a pitchfork into the son’s back killing him almost instantly. Realizing what he had done, Dan ran away into the nearby woods. After confessing to her master, Mary died that same day after drowning herself. A bounty of 1000 dollars was placed on Dan's head. Two months later, he was caught and taken to former Mr. Burmey’s other two sons, Peter and John. The two brothers tied him down and burned him alive, slowly cooking him in a pile of crudely placed wood. In the same year both brothers incidentally perished in a fire, they were drunk as usual and locked themselves into a barn. That night the barn caught ablaze and devoured them, in an attempt to save her son’s Mr. Burmey’s wife broke into the barn, was struck on the head by a piece of falling timber and joined her boys in their fate.
At age 20, Jacob’s master had him marry another one of the slave girls. Five months after the marriage, she gave birth to a white boy. When Jacob inquired who the father was, she told him it was the master. Nonetheless, they were a happy couple and lived together for six years, having a total of two children. When the master’s wife died, he sought the doctor’s daughter to be his future wife. When they got married, she ordered any female slave who had ever been intimate with the master to be sold. Jacob was out running errands when his wife was sold, along with both their children and as much as he begged his master to sell him to the same person his master refused.
Significance.
In the 19th century there were many slaves who wrote autobiographies that were later published. Jacob D. Green is one of those “lost” voices and his story is one of the many that should be heard. Jacob in particular gave lectures at schools after he became free and gave light to s grim subject. His entire autobiography is located here.
Masters.
His first master was Judge Charles Earle and Mr. Cobb (they were both of authority but Mr. Cobb’s position on the plantation was unclear). They was a strict men, who thought that if you did what you were told I did not complain that blacks would go to heaven.
"“When you die (if your obedient to your masters, and good niggers), your black faces will shine like black jugs around the throne of God.” "- Mr. Cobb (recorded by Jacob D Green)"
Although Jacob attempted to escape from Judge Charles Earle twice, when selling Jacob he gave him a good word to the buyers at the auction (most likely for personal gain). Jacob’s second master was not named, but his third master was going to be Mr. Steele if he had not successfully escaped…
Religious Views.
Jacob once believed in God and was one of the most faithfully religious of all the slaves on the plantation. But when realizing he had to escape from his master his autobiography said no more about his views on God.

Korea National University of Arts

Korea National University of Arts (K-ARTS/KNUA) is a national university in Seoul, South Korea. Korea National University of Arts was established in 1993 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea as the only national university of arts with an aim to serve as a leading institution which cultivates artists. It has 26 departments in six schools: Schools of Music, Drama, Film TV & Multimedia, Dance, Visual Arts, and Korean Traditional Arts.
History.
Korea National University of Arts was established by law in 1993. In 1990, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Korea announced a 'Ten-Year Project for the Cultural Development,' and the foundation of a national arts institution was the crucial provision of this project. Until the early 1980s, in Korea, there was no specialized university that devoted its entire curriculum to artistic endeavors. Therefore, many budding artists who wanted to continue their artistic search through professional trainings went abroad. The announcement of the foundation of the national university of arts in 1993 was thus the revelation and manifestation of artistic prosperity in Korea. It is the only national university in Asia dedicated exclusively to preparing talented young artists for the professions of all artistic genres. Korea National University of Arts encompasses all disciplines of arts including music, dance, theatre, film, TV, animation, fine art, design, architecture, and Korean traditional arts.
The university consists of six independent but correlative schools: the School of Music, the School of Drama, the School of Film, TV & Multimedia, the School of Dance, the School of Visual Arts, and the School of Korean Traditional Arts. K-ARTS offers Bachelor's and Master's degree program while providing pre-school training program for promising young students. As of 2003, students enrolled in K-ARTS are about 2600, and more than 730 professors and lecturers are teaching in the newest studios and classrooms.
Campus.
Korea National University of Arts is made up of two Seoul-based campuses: the Seokgwan Campus and the Seocho Campus.
Achievements.

Don't Stop (Innerpartysystem song)

"Don't Stop" is the debut single by the American band Innerpartysystem from the band's self-titled debut album. Before being mastered the song was officially released on the band's debut EP (although an earlier demo had been published on the bands MySpace profile beforehand). The single was re-released mainly due to poor endorsement by American music channels.
The lyrics of the song focus on celebrity culture and lies within the media and celebrities. The lyrics are sung in first person as a celebrity who may have no specific talent or is famous purely because of his/her wealth (famous for being famous) and this person is only interested in the attention to which a celebrity may receive, in the song these people are perceived as liars. The song portrays these celebrities as the public's entertainment and the public wrongly feed these celebrities with their attention. 
The physical platforms of the single were only released in the United Kingdom.
The single peaked at #35 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2008 
Music video.
Version one.
Jared Piccone on the filming of the video:
The video had some controversy when being published by TV networks as many demanded the video be cut to reduce flashing so the video could pass the Harding Test. MTV UK also demanded that the ball gag and mouth opening device be cut from the video for the video to be played during day.
The music video can be found on a bonus DVD with the album, on the CD single and on the band's website.
Version two.
After the original video was found to be too shocking for many musical channels, and the fact that the flashing was excessive enough to cause a warning to appear on some music channels, a new video was filmed. The video was again filmed and edited by the band's videographer Stephan Penta. 
The video shows a couple watching a 1950's style talk show where the host insults his female cohost and introduces the band who perform a live performance. During the performance, actors move and dance in an animated doll-like motion as if to emphasive surreality of the show. Like the first video, it was shot with a low budget and features the news reporters from the first video, this time playing as an audience.
Track listing.
The single contains many B-sides and remixes available on different platforms. The song Redemption can be found as a B-side on the CD track list, this is a mastered version of the earlier "Niterider", with slight changes to the song's drum beats. The B-side on the Vinyl is a cover of Joy Division's song Transmission, mixed in a more electronic fashion.

My Brother Jonathan

My Brother Jonathan is a 1948 British drama film directed by Harold French, adapted from a novel by Francis Brett Young. It starred Michael Denison, Dulcie Gray, and James Robertson Justice.
Plot.
The story revolves around the life of Jonathan Dakers (Denison), a small town doctor. He is training to be a surgeon when his father dies. Due to the resulting financial problems, he cannot continue his training. He buys a share in Dr. Hammond's general practice in a poor foundry town.
When he notes that many patients have been injured in industrial accidents at the foundry, Dakers comes into conflict with its owner Sir Joseph Higgins, and the owner's son-in-law Dr Craig, who owns the town's competing medical practice. He writes a report criticizing the condition of the foundry and buildings the workers live in but Craig, who is also the local Health Officer, deliberately mislays it.
As a child Jonathan met Edie Martyn (Gray). Years later they meet again when he is training in a hospital. He has a thing for Edie, however his brother Harold and she fall in love. Harold is killed in World War 2, but Edie is pregnant. To save her from shame Jonathan marries her. However he is also in love with Rachel Hammond, the daughter of his medical partner. Soon after giving birth to a son, Edie dies, first telling Jonathan to be happy with Rachel, whom he latter marries.
When he performs a life saving tracheotomy on a child with diphtheria, and takes the child to the hospital, he is charged with misconduct, as the hospital charter precludes infectious cases.
Reception.
The film was a big hit on release, being the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1948. It led to Michael Denison being voted the 6th most popular British star.

Massachusetts gateway cities

Massachusetts gateway cities are "midsize urban centers that anchor regional economies around the state," facing "stubborn social and economic challenges" while retaining "many assets with unrealized potential." These communities, which all had a legacy of economic success, have struggled as the state's economy shifted toward skills-centered knowledge sectors (increasingly clustered in and around Boston).
Original cities and the Compact.
The designation initially comprised eleven cities named in a 2007 report co-authored by the Brookings Institution and the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth (MassINC). In May 2008 the chief executives of the eleven Gateway Cities gathered at the Old State House in Boston "to sign a compact to unite their administrations in future efforts aimed at economic and community development," asserting their desire to work cooperatively to address issues of common concern.
Additional cities.
A legislative definition (Section 3A of Chapter 23A of the General Laws of Massachusetts) put in place in 2009 and amended in 2010 expanded the designation of gateway cities with thirteen more locations, for a total of 24 cities. Under the General Laws, gateway cities have a population between 35,000 and 250,000, with an average household income below the state average and an average educational attainment rate (Bachelor's or above) below the state average. Updates to the Census data in 2013 led to the addition of two cities (Attleboro and Peabody) for a total of 26 communities.

Lie product formula

In mathematics, the Lie product formula, named for Sophus Lie, states that for arbitrary "n" × "n" real or complex matrices "A" and "B", 
where "e""A" denotes the matrix exponential of "A". 
The Lie–Trotter product formula and the Trotter–Kato theorem extend this to certain unbounded linear operators "A" and "B". 
This formula is an analogue of the classical exponential law
which holds for all real or complex numbers "x" and "y". If "x" and "y" are replaced with matrices "A" and "B", and the exponential replaced with a matrix exponential, it is usually necessary for "A" and "B" to commute for the law to still hold. However, the Lie product formula holds for all matrices "A" and "B", even ones which do not commute. 
It is a trivial corollary of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula.
The formula has applications, for example, in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. It allows one to separate the Schrödinger evolution operator into alternating increments of kinetic and potential operators. The same idea is used in the construction of splitting methods for the numerical solution of differential equations. Moreover, the Lie product theorem is sufficient to prove the Feynman-Kac formula.

Palmer Catholic Academy

Canon Palmer Catholic School was the first Roman Catholic secondary academy school located in Seven Kings, Ilford, in London, England.
The school consists of 5 buildings, each named after notable Catholic figures. Palmer House, named after the schools founder; Canon Patrick Palmer, Heenan House, Kolbe house, Mother Theresa house and the new Bede House, £4 million new development which was officially opened in September 2008 by the current head teacher, Mr Frank Maguire. The school is a specialist Science Mathematics and Computing college. The school recently received an Academy status therefore having the name changed to "The Palmer Catholic Academy"
The Palmer Catholic Academy also has a sixth form.
History of the Academy.
Canon Patrick Palmer (1869-1948), the priest who gave his name to our Academy, spent 50 years between 1896 and 1946 helping transform the Catholic faith and church in Ilford.
He was responsible for the building of the first permanent church on Ilford High Road in 1899, and later next to it the Guildhall Catholic club in 1925. He was also responsible for the building of the churches in Manor Park and Barkingside. He built the first Catholic school in Ilford on the High street opening in 1900, later followed by Saint Winifred’s school in Manor Park.
By entering the beautiful atrium and then taking a visit to the modernised laboratories in Bede House, there is no doubt that The Palmer Catholic Academy has flourished, not only as a vibrant education establishment, but also as a community. This historical journey began in 1961, and since then the academy has blossomed into becoming a well established co-educational comprehensive of 1300 pupils that continues to serve the Catholic community till this day.
Our academy would still be the site of a nursery were it not for the devotion and dedication of our founder, the much respected Canon Patrick Palmer. He led the foundation of the Catholic community in and around Ilford, despite suffering through much of his life as a result of a serious injury occurring in 1912. Despite poor health, Patrick Palmer soon exhibited his dynamism, leading Cardinal Vaughan to describe him as 'the most remarkable Priest in my Diocese.' Two years after his arrival in Ilford, he laid the foundation of Ss Peter and Paul's Church, hence his name is often being portrayed as synonymous with the Parish. Our site was previously a farm known as Aldborough Nursery Garden. It was not the only piece of local farmland; it was accompanied by Ley St. Farm, Downshall Farm, Seven Kings Farm and Primrose Farm located just off Romford Road. Canon Palmer's achievements and works include the recognition of how vital the education of Catholic children was; his last business act was to obtain a suitable site in Seven Kings for a secondary school. In 1940, the Cameron Road site was bought for £11,000. Canon Palmer donated most of his years for the good of those people commended to his care, to the Glory of God and to the saving of souls. Unfortunately he did not live to see the full completion of his outstanding school.
Canon Palmer Catholic School was opened in 1961, thirteen years after his death, welcoming young Catholics into the school by promoting faith as a vehicle for delivering higher academic achievements. The opening of the school in January was an exciting and enthusiastic time - thousands of Catholics saw the fulfillment of their hopes as it was the first Roman Catholic secondary school in the area. The local Roman Catholics had a school to be proud of, especially considering the opening ceremony was performed by the Rt. Rev. George Andrew Beck, Bishop of Salford. The event was also attended by many representatives of the Education Committee, Ilford Council and other local associations. At a prize giving event in October 1961, the Mayor - Mr. Owen Waters - presented the school with a portrait of Canon Patrick Palmer.
The first Headmaster of the school was Mr Murphy. After staying at the school for seven memorable years, he placed responsibility into the hands of Mr Davis who displayed similar commitment over the period 1968 to 1986, creating the Canon Palmer Home School Association. He was followed by Mr O'Donnell until 1992, when Mr Chichon became Headmaster. He expressed his desire to be part of Canon Palmer society at first sight, and before his retirement he said 'Now twenty-two years later, I am happy to have followed my instincts of that first impression and I consider it a real honour to have served and led such a fine school.' Upon his departure in 2001 Canon Palmer was introduced to our current Headmaster Mr Maguire, who has had an immeasurable impact on the school.
A new chapter in our history began in August 2011 when we successfully achieved Academy status. It was at this juncture that we became The Palmer Catholic Academy.
It is apparent that all head teachers have gained a unique experience during their time here and have lent their energy and vision to its improvement. During its relatively short life, the school has seen a vast range of developments. When the school first opened, there was a two-form entry of about three hundred children, many of whom had previously attended Ss Peter and Paul's Junior school. Later this was expanded to a three-form entry with a total of five hundred pupils.
The original school was small and limited with regards to specialist and practical facilities, whereas our present school is large and well equipped. The school originally started off with just Palmer building, adorned with two large crucifixes to portray the school's identity and allegiance with the Church. This was followed by Heenan and Kolbe buildings. More recent developments include the building of Mother Teresa Sixth Form Centre as well as Bede House, both causing a particular thrill in the school environment. We were also designated a specialist Science, Maths and Computing College by the Department for Education.
We believe that the school's community will continue to be strengthened in the coming years as Canon Patrick Palmer would have wished. His energy, enthusiasm and belief live on in the Catholic ethos of the school. Mr Waters said, 'This is one of the greatest functions I have attended during my years of office because it gives me the opportunity to place before you boys and girls a portrait of the man whose name lives on in our school.

Württembergischer Yacht Club

The Württembergischer Yacht-Club (WYC) is a yacht club in Friedrichshafen. It is located on the pleasant shores of Lake Constance, Germany. This club was established in January 1911 as the "Königlich Württembergischer Yacht-Club" (Royal Yacht Club of Württemberg).
History.
The WYC was originally inscribed in the local Tettnang registry as the "Königlich Württembergischer Yacht-Club". It began under King Wilhelm II of Württemberg's royal patronage. Soon after its establishment, a small clubhouse was built. 
Despite living in a landlocked kingdom, King William was a ship enthusiast. He had a vision of a German Fleet reaching deep into the country through its rivers. The king was instrumental in the establishment of the Württembergischer Yacht Club.
This move followed the establishment of Yacht clubs in the neighboring kingdoms of Bavaria, Austria and Baden at the time. 
In 1918, King William was deposed from the throne along with the other German rulers by the German Revolution (German: Novemberrevolution). In 1920, despite the ravages of World War I, the club had 358 members.
Old King William II, the founder of the club, died on October 2d 1921.
In 1937, during Nazi rule in Germany, the Sports Office of the Reich took away the power and freedom of all German sport associations. As a result, the Württembergischer Yacht Club was forcefully merged ("Einverleibt") with other German yacht clubs, foremost of which were the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club of Kiel and the Yacht Club of Bavaria (Bayerischer Yacht-Club) of Munich to form a massive entity, the "Yacht-Club von Deutschland" (Yacht Club of Germany). 
The members of the House of Württemberg, the former ruling family of Württemberg, are still closely involved with the Württembergischer Yacht Club. The title of honorary commodore of the WYC was first held by King William II and it was passed on through Duke Albrecht, Duke Philipp to the present day's commodore Duke Carl of Württemberg.

Meyer's law

Meyer's law is an empirical relation between the size of a hardness test indentation and the load required to leave the indentation. The formula was devised by Prof. Eugene Meyer of the Materials Testing Laboratory at the Imperial School of Technology, Charlottenburg, Germany, circa 1908.
Equation.
It takes the form:
formula_1
where
n usually lies between the values of 2, for fully strain hardened materials, and 2.5, for fully annealed materials. It is roughly related to the strain hardening coefficient in the equation for the true stress-true strain curve by adding 2. Note, however, that below approximately d = the value of n can surpass 3. Because of this Meyer's law is often restricted to values of d greater than 0.5 mm up to the diameter of the indenter.
The variables k and n are also dependent on the size of the indenter. Despite this, it has been found that the values can be related using the equation:
formula_2
Meyer's law is often used to relate hardness values based on the fact that if the weight is halved and the diameter of the indenter is quartered. For instance, the hardness value for a test load of 3000 kg and a 10 mm indenter is the same for a test load of 750 kg and a 5 mm diameter indenter. This relationship isn't perfect, but its percent error is relatively small.
A modified form of this equation was put forth by Onitsch:

A Day to Remember (1953 film)

A Day to Remember is a 1953 British comedy drama film directed by Ralph Thomas and starring an ensemble cast including Stanley Holloway, Donald Sinden and Bill Owen. The darts team of a London public house go on a day trip to Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.
Plot.
On the eve of their visit to France the members of the Hand & Flower pub darts team gather for a drink. The day trip is being organised by one of their regulars who is a travel agent. For some of the team it is their first ever trip abroad, while for others it is the first time they have returned to France since the war. One of the team has developed a plan to buy watches in France and smuggle them back into Britain to sell at a profit. Another, Jim Carver, is going through a rocky patch with his fiancee, who he suspects considers him to be boring and plain.
The following day the group meet at London Victoria and catch the boat train to Boulogne. Once they have landed in France, despite the insistence of their unofficial leader the pub's landlord that they stick together, Jim Carver departs to visit a farm where he had been involved in heavy fighting during 1944 when British troops had arrived to liberate France. He takes some flowers to the cemetery where his comrade is buried. He then meets a young woman, Martine, who he first met eight years before, who invites him to have lunch with her family on the farm. They immediately strike up a chemistry, which his relationship with his fiancee in England lacks. However his newfound friend is also engaged to a local lawyer. 
Back in the town, the rest of the group enjoy a lunch in a cafe and then break up into smaller groups to tour round the town. One goes to try to pick up his black market watches, another gets drunk and joins the foreign legion in spite of their efforts to stop him. One of the group becomes violent homesick despite having left England only hours before. After attempting to, and failing to retrieve their friend from service in the foreign legion the group begins to drift towards the docks and the ship that will carry them on their voyage home – and wonder what has happened to Carver who has been missing all day.
Carver has fallen in love with Martine, and she has broken up with Henri. However they argue and he heads for his ship without her. Unbeknownst to him, his fiancee in London has met and struck up a relationship with an American servicemen during a visit to Hampton Court.

Clickjacking

Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous web pages. It is a browser security issue that is a vulnerability across a variety of browsers and platforms. A clickjack takes the form of embedded code or a script that can execute without the user's knowledge, such as clicking on a button that appears to perform another function. The term "clickjacking" was coined by Jeremiah Grossman and Robert Hansen in 2008. Clickjacking can be understood as an instance of the confused deputy problem.
Description.
Clickjacking is possible because seemingly harmless features of HTML web pages can be employed to perform unexpected actions.
A clickjacked page tricks a user into performing undesired actions by clicking on a concealed link. On a clickjacked page, the attackers load another page over it in a transparent layer. The users think that they are clicking visible buttons, while they are actually performing actions on the hidden page. The hidden page may be an authentic page; therefore, the attackers can trick users into performing actions which the users never intended. There is no way of tracing such actions to the attackers later, as the users would have been genuinely authenticated on the hidden page.
Examples.
A user might receive an email with a link to a video about a news item, but another valid page, say a product page on Amazon.com, can be "hidden" on top or underneath the "PLAY" button of the news video. The user tries to "play" the video but actually "buys" the product from Amazon.
Other known exploits include:
Likejacking.
Likejacking is a malicious technique of tricking users of a website into posting a Facebook status update for a site they did not intentionally mean to "like". The term "likejacking" came from a comment posted by Corey Ballou in the article "How to "Like" Anything on the Web (Safely)", which is one of the first documented postings explaining the possibility of malicious activity regarding Facebook's "like" button.
According to an article in "IEEE Spectrum", a solution to likejacking was developed at one of Facebook's hackathons. A "Like" bookmarklet is available that avoids the possibility of likejacking present in the Facebook Like Button.
Cursorjacking.
Cursorjacking is a UI redressing technique to change the cursor from the location the user perceives, discovered in 2010 by Eddy Bordi, a researcher at Vulnerability.fr, Marcus Niemietz demonstrated this with a custom cursor icon, and in 2012 Mario Heiderich by hiding the cursor.
Prevention.
Client-side.
NoScript.
Protection against clickjacking (including likejacking) can be added to Mozilla Firefox desktop and mobile versions by installing the NoScript add-on: its ClearClick feature, released on 8 October 2008, prevents users from clicking on invisible or "redressed" page elements of embedded documents or applets. According to Google's "Browser Security Handbook", NoScript's ClearClick is "the only freely available product that offers a reasonable degree of protection" against Clickjacking. Protection from the newer cursorjacking attack was added to NoScript 2.2.8 RC1.
GuardedID.
GuardedID (a commercial product) includes client-side clickjack protection for users of Internet Explorer and Firefox without interfering with the operation of legitimate iFrames. GuardedID clickjack protection forces all frames to become visible.
Gazelle.
Gazelle is a Microsoft Research project secure web browser based on IE, that uses an OS-like security model, and has its own limited defenses against clickjacking. In Gazelle, a window of different origin may only draw dynamic content over another window's screen space if the content it draws is opaque.
Server-side.
Framekiller.
Web site owners can protect their users against UI redressing (frame based clickjacking) on the server side by including a framekiller JavaScript snippet in those pages they do not want to be included inside frames from different sources.
Such JavaScript-based protection, unfortunately, is not always reliable. This is especially true on Internet Explorer, where this kind of countermeasure can be circumvented "by design" by including the targeted page inside an <IFRAME SECURITY=restricted> element.
Server and client.
Content Security Policy is proposed standard countermeasure against clickjacking and other similar attacks.
X-Frame-Options.
On 26 January 2009 Microsoft released RC1 of Internet Explorer 8, which includes a new partial clickjacking prevention option. Web site developers will be able to add a HTTP header to help detect and prevent frame-based UI redressing. IE 8, according to Microsoft, “will detect sites that insert the tag and give users a new error screen indicating that the content host has chosen not to allow their content to be framed, while giving users the option to open the content in a new window.” 
Microsoft's suggested solution, which has since also been implemented in the Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera Web browsers, is to check for a new HTTP header, X-Frame-Options. This header can take the values DENY, SAMEORIGIN, or ALLOW-FROM "origin", which will prevent any framing, prevent framing by external sites, or allow framing only by the specified site, respectively. In addition to that, some advertising sites return a non-standard ALLOWALL value with the intention to allow framing their content on any page (equivalent of not setting X-Frame-Options at all).
In 2013 the X-Frame-Options header has been officially standardized as RFC 7034

The Charioteer of Delphi

The Charioteer of Delphi is a children's historical novel by Caroline Lawrence, published in 2006. It is the twelfth volume of the Roman Mysteries series. Like several of Lawrence’s novels, it explores a particular aspect of daily life in Ancient Rome: in this case, chariot racing.
Plot summary.
September, A.D. 80: Flavia, Jonathan, Nubia, and Lupus are celebrating Nubia's birthday with their families and their friend Porcius, when a teenaged boy named Scopas arrives from Delphi with a message from Lupus’s mother, Melissa. She sends her love to her son, and asks, as a favor, that he help Scopas find a job with one of the chariot racing factions in Rome. He has already won races in Greece, despite being barely 13 years old. Though Scopas is awkward and strange in his manner, Flavia agrees to help him, and sends him to Rome with a letter asking her uncle and avid racing fan, Senator Cornix, to arrange an introduction.
A few weeks later, Scopas sends a letter to Ostia, saying that he has been taken on by the Green faction at the Circus Maximus, which is facing a crisis: their prize racing horse, Sagitta, has disappeared, and the Greens are offering a 100,000 sestercii reward for his safe return before the start of the next games. Flavia and the others arrange a trip to Rome when Flavia's father has to commission some repair work on their home, and leave on another voyage.
Arriving in Rome with Aristo, they are taken to the Greens’ stables to meet Scopas, who works as a groom. The lead trainer, Urbanus, says Scopas is the best groom he has ever known, but the other grooms despise him for his strange behavior (and possibly out of jealousy).
Among the Greens' recently acquired horses, Nubia recognizes a stallion named Pegasus, who was previously owned by Publius Pollius Felix (in "The Sirens of Surrentum"). Nubia confides that she has been having nightmares about being trapped in a burning tent; showing a surprising empathy with the horses, she believes that both she and Pegasus have terrible memories of losing family members to fire when they were very young.
As the children leave the stables to begin looking for Sagitta, a one-legged beggar says he knows exactly where to find the horse. Flavia is skeptical, but Nubia gives him a coin, and to everyone's amazement, the horse is indeed waiting right where the beggar said he would be. The horse is healthy, though there are signs that his legs have been burned. They lead the horse back to the stables in triumph, earning the reward, free entry permits to the stables, and a complimentary ride in the team's chariots during one of their practice runs.
When Flavia and Co. attend the first day of the races with Senator Cornix and his family, things begin to go wrong for the Greens. Inexplicably, the horses being driven by the most prestigious charioteers go berserk on the track, throwing their riders and causing terrible, often fatal, crashes. In the stables, the four friends find other examples of sabotage, including stealing the charioteers' personal votive statuettes, and replacing the pins of the chariots with wax replicas.
Flavia theorizes that someone has a grudge against the Greens, or else is trying to fix the race to win at gambling. She suspects Urbanus, who is strangely ambivalent about their success in exposing several of the sabotage tricks. But her theory seems to fail when two charioteers from the Red faction are also put out of action.
Lupus scouts out the track during the next race, and sees a boy, disguised as one of the Greens’ stable boys, hiding near the track with a bone whistle. Flavia realizes that several of the Greens' star horses have been abducted, and then returned, after being tortured with fire and conditioned to fear burning when they hear a high-pitched sound. Urbanus is skeptical, until Nubia blows a note on her flute and Sagitta goes berserk inside his stall.
Urbanus panics, realizing that without Sagitta, he does not have a team ready to run in the next day’s race. Scopas steps forward, volunteering to drive a team with Pegasus in Sagitta's place. Urbanus grudgingly agrees.
Flavia realizes that all of the targeted charioteers were drivers for the Greens in the previous year, including the two who now race for the Reds. The only one left is a man named Hierax, who they are told retired after being maimed in a crash a year ago. The friends return to their seats with Senator Cornix, to watch the remainder of the races. But when they get up to leave, Flavia realizes that Nubia and Lupus are gone. Running back to the stables, they see that Pegasus is also gone.
It turns out that the one-legged beggar who helped them before has convinced Nubia to lead Pegasus away from the stables, rather than risk him being hurt in the races. Nubia has come to love the horse, and seizes on the chance to take him to a better place. The beggar leads them to a supposedly abandoned house in Rome, which has a stable outfitted to receive Pegasus.
But Nubia realizes that the house isn't abandoned at all, it belongs to the “beggar” who reveals himself to her at the same time Flavia and the others learn his true identity: he is Hierax, the former charioteer. After losing his celebrity and his leg after the chariot accident, he has become bitter and vengeful; in his paranoia, he now believes that the crash and everything that came after was a conspiracy by Urbanus and the Greens to get rid of him. He has arranged the whole series of accidents to get his revenge on the Greens.
But as he steps forward to tie Nubia up, Pegasus rears and knocks over a lamp, setting the stable on fire.
Lupus has followed Nubia as far as the house, and runs back to the Circus to fetch reinforcements. Urbanus, Flavia, Jonathan, and Senator Cornix rush to the house as it begins to burn. Inside, Nubia douses herself and Pegasus with water and then mounts him, whispering that the only way to save their lives is for Pegasus to brave his fears and jump through the flames. He does so, and they escape the house. But Urbanus has already run inside to see if there are any others, and is trapped by falling debris. Remembering the other victims of the great fire in Rome, that he blames on himself, Jonathan rushes inside and drags Urbanus to safety, suffering a near-fatal asthma attack as a result of smoke inhalation. Everyone recovers, and Hierax and his accomplices are brought into custody.
The next day, Scopas convinces Nubia that, although chariot racing may be very dangerous, both he and Pegasus truly love it. Nubia senses through her bond with Pegasus that this is true. She gives Pegasus her blessing before he runs his first race.
To everyone's great amazement, Scopas wins the race, something unheard of for a novice charioteer in his first run. The children's friend, Senator Cornix's slave Sisyphus, wins his freedom on a bet from Senator Cornix, and makes a small fortune betting his savings on Scopas. Scopas receives his victory crown from the Emperor himself, and as he takes his triumphal ride around the track, he invites Nubia to join him, calling it her victory as well as his. Senator Cornix's two young children, yelling Scopas’s name, say “Scorpus” by mistake, and the crowd takes up the chant with enthusiasm. Scopus says he doesn't mind. “It can be my new name for my new life.”

Alfred Waldron (footballer)

Alfred Edward 'Topsy' Waldron (26 February 1857 – 7 June 1929) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Norwood in the South Australian Football Association (SAFA) during the 19th century. He also played a couple of first-class cricket matches for South Australia.
Waldron, who was captain of Norwood for a club record ten seasons, played in eight of their early premiership teams, six as captain. He had started his career at Albert Park and then crossed to Carlton in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). After playing in Carlton's 1877 VFA premiership side, Waldron was convinced by a friend to go to Norwood and he joined them for their second season in the SAFA.
In 1888, Waldron captained Norwood to victory in the inaugural Championship of Australia. The club took on South Melbourne at Kensington Oval for the title and won the series 3–0. He also captained South Australia in three inter-colonial games and played in three others. When the South Australian Football Hall of Fame was opened to inductees in 2002, Waldron was one of the first added and the oldest.
His two first-class cricket matches were played almost five years apart, in the 1881/82 and 1887/88 summers. Waldron failed with the bat in both but took 3 for 18 against Victoria at the Adelaide Oval in what was the only innings he bowled in. One of those wickets was Test cricketer Tup Scott.

Govardhan Puja

Govardhan Puja, also called Annakut (meaning a heap of grain) , is celebrated as the day Krishna defeated Indra. It is the fourth day of Dipavali (Diwali), the Hindu festival of lights. 
The day is celebrated on the first lunar day of Shukla Paksha (Bright fortnight) in the Hindu calendar month of Kartika.
According to legends, Lord Krishna taught people to worship the Supreme Controller of nature, God, specifically Govardhan, as Govardhan is a manifestation of Krishna, and to stop worshiping the God of Rains, Lord Indra. For Annakut a mountain of food is decorated symbolizing Govardhan mountain said to be lifted by Lord Krishna to save the people from the wrath of Lord Indra, the demigod in charge of rain. This pooja is performed with great zeal and enthusiasm and in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In Haryana, there is a tradition of building cow dung hillocks, which symbolize the Mount Govardhan, the mountain which was once lifted by Lord Krishna. After making such hillocks people decorate them with flowers and then worship them. They move in a circle all round the cow dung hillocks and offer prayers to Lord Govardhan.In Haryana Govardhan Puja forms an important part of the celebrations of Diwali. In Maharashtra it is celebrated as Padva or BaliPratipada. The day commemorates King Bali. Men present gifts to their wives on this day. In Haryana, Gujarat, it is celebrated as New Year, as Vikram Samvat starts on this day. Govardhan puja is when Lord Krishna stopped the people of Vrindavan dham worshipping Lord Indra because Indra had become too proud of himself so Lord Krishna completely stopped it and told the inhabitants of Vrindavana to worship Govardhan Hill. This worship has carried on from 5000 years ago to the 21st Century. And

Morning Song (album)

Morning Song is the sixth album by David Murray to be released on the Italian Black Saint label. It was released in 1983 and features performances by Murray, John Hicks, Reggie Workman and Ed Blackwell.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars stating "For David Murray, this is a fairly straightforward quartet date. Joined by pianist John Hicks, bassist Reggie Workman and drummer Ed Blackwell, Murray performs three of his lesser-known originals, Butch Morris' "Light Blue Frolic," "Body and Soul" and "Jitterbug Waltz." Doubling on tenor and bass clarinet, Murray as usual has a tendency to jump into the extreme upper register a bit too much at unexpected times, disrupting a relatively mellow mood on a few occasions. But one cannot deny his musicianship, and there are some exciting moments to be heard during this program".

Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)

"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her third studio album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" (2008). It was released by Columbia Records on October 13, 2008, as the album's lead single alongside "If I Were a Boy", showcasing the contrast between Beyoncé's persona as herself and her aggressive onstage alter ego Sasha Fierce. Inspired by her secret marriage to Jay-Z in April 2008, the song explores men's unwillingness to commit, a topic that motivated Beyoncé to write "Single Ladies", "the only public statement and Jay-Z ever made about marriage".
Composed by Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, Terius "The-Dream" Nash, Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell and Beyoncé, "Single Ladies" is a dance-pop and R&B song with dancehall, disco and bounce influences. According to the lyrics, the female protagonist is in a club to celebrate after a recent end to a poor relationship; her former lover is also present. The song and the repeated refrain, "If you like it then you should have put a ring on it", are directed to him. Critics praised the song for its smooth production and noted its similarity to Beyoncé's 2007 single "Get Me Bodied". "Single Ladies" won the Grammy Awards for the Song of the Year, Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. It received many other awards and nominations between 2008 and 2010, and was named one of the best songs of 2008 by media outlets including MTV News, "Rolling Stone", and "Time" magazine. It was also included on many critics' list of the best songs of the 2000s.
"Single Ladies" peaked at number one on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and has been certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold more than 5 million paid digital downloads as of October 2012. The song reached the top ten on the singles charts of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, and achieved multi-platinum certifications in many of these countries. "Single Ladies" was 2009's seventh best-selling digital single with over 6.1 million copies sold worldwide, and is one of the best-selling singles of all-time.
Directed by Jake Nava, the single's accompanying music video was shot in black-and-white. It features the J-Setting dance choreography that was inspired by "Mexican Breakfast", a 1969 routine choreographed by Bob Fosse. The music video has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the "first major dance craze" of the Internet age. The dance routine was first parodied on the November 15, 2008, episode of "Saturday Night Live" ("SNL"). The clip has won several awards, including Video of the Year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Beyoncé performed the song live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and during her worldwide I Am... World Tour. Artists including Alan Pownall, Katy Perry, Liza Minnelli and Sara Bareilles have covered "Single Ladies", and it has been featured in television shows and other media.
Background and release.
"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" was written by Beyoncé, Terius Nash, Thaddis Harrell and Christopher Stewart, and was produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in April 2008 at the The Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. The-Dream conceptualized "Single Ladies" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was "the only public statement that and Jay-Z had ever made about marriage", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired The-Dream to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with "Billboard" magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that "people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate". She stated that although "Single Ladies" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.
In "Single Ladies", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of "I Am... Sasha Fierce". The song was released simultaneously with "If I Were a Boy"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; "Single Ladies" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; "Single Ladies" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while "If I Were a Boy" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio. The two songs were released as a double A-side single on November 7, 2008, in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Dance remixes of the song were made available in the US on February 10, 2009, and in Europe on February 16, 2009. "Single Ladies" was not originally released as a single in the UK, but the song became increasingly popular there and reached the top ten in the UK Singles Chart as a result of download sales. On February 16, 2009, it was released as a CD single, and the dance remixes became available as a digital download.
Composition and lyrical interpretation.
"Single Ladies" is an upbeat dance-pop and R&B song with dancehall, disco, and bounce influences. It is set in common time, and makes use of staccato bounce-based hand claps, Morse code beeps, an ascending whistle in the background, and a punchy organic beat. The instrumentation includes a bass drum, a keyboard and spaced out synthesizers that occasionally zoom in and out; one commentator, Sarah Liss of CBC News, noted that their arrangement surprisingly comes as light, instead of dense. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, "Single Ladies" is written in the key of E major and played in a moderate groove of 96 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of F3 to D5. It has a chord progression of E in the verses, and Bdim–C–Bdim–Am in the chorus. J. Freedom du Lac of "The Washington Post" noted the song features "playground vocals".
"Single Ladies" is musically similar to Beyoncé's 2007 single "Get Me Bodied"; Andy Kellman of Allmusic called it a "dire throwback" to the song. Stewart and Harrell said in an interview given to "People" magazine that the similar rhythm of the two songs is "what Beyoncé responds to". Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" saw the song's theme of female empowerment as an extension of that of "Irreplaceable" (2006), and Daniel Brockman of "The Phoenix" noted that its usage of "blurry pronouns" such as "it" resembles Beyoncé's 2005 single "Check on It". Liss commented that the beat of the "Single Ladies" evokes African gumboot dancing and schoolyard Double Dutch chants, a view shared by Douglas Wolf of "Time" magazine. Trish Crawford of the "Toronto Star" concluded that "Single Ladies" is "a strong song of female empowerment", and other music critics have noted its appeal to Beyoncé's fan base of independent women as in the song, Beyoncé offers support to women who have split up from their no-good boyfriends.
In "Single Ladies", Beyoncé emphasizes her aggressive and sensual alter ego Sasha Fierce. She displays much attitude in her voice, as stated by Nick Levine of Digital Spy. Echoing Levine's sentiments, Liss wrote that Beyoncé sounds "gleefully sassy". The lyrics reflect post-breakup situations. Accompanied by robotic-like sounds, the opening lines of the song are call and response; Beyoncé chants, "All the single ladies", and background singers echo the line each time. In the first verse, Beyoncé narrates the recent end to a poor relationship after she "cried tears for three good years". She reclaims her right to flirt, have fun, and find a lover who is more devoted than the previous one. Beyoncé goes out to celebrate with her friends in a club where she meets a new love interest. However, her former boyfriend is watching her, and she directs the song to him. She then sings the chorus, which uses minor chords and contains several hooks, "If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it ... Oh oh oh".
In the second verse, Beyoncé tells her ex-lover that, as he did not attempt to make things more permanent when he had the chance, he has no reason to complain now that she has found someone else. On the bridge, she affirms that she wants her new love interest "to make like a prince and grab her, delivering her to 'a destiny, to infinity and beyond" while "Prince Charming is left standing there like the second lead in a romantic comedy". Towards the end of the song, Beyoncé takes a more aggressive vocal approach and employs a middle eight as she sings, "And like a ghost I'll be gone". When she chants the chorus for the third and final time, her vocals are omnipresent within layers of music, as described by Frannie Kelley of NPR. An electronic swoop tugs in continuously until the song ends.
Critical reception.
Reviews.
"Single Ladies" received positive response from music critics, who complimented its production. Nick Levine of Digital Spy particularly praised its beats, which according to him, "just don't quit". Michelangelo Matos of "The A.V. Club" wrote that the song is "fabulous, with glowing production, a humongous hook, and beats for weeks". Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" was also impressed with the overall production of the song, specifically the chorus, adding "More than most female singers, Beyoncé understands the funky art of singing rhythmically, and this is a prime example." Fraser McAlpine of BBC Online considered "Single Ladies" to be the best song Beyoncé has attempted since "Ring the Alarm" (2006) and complimented the former's refrain, describing it as "so amazingly catchy that it provides a surprisingly solid foundation for the entire song". Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" commended the threatening atmosphere that "Single Ladies" creates by using minor chords. Daniel Brockman of "The Phoenix" complimented the song's use of the word "it", and wrote that the technique "sums up her divided musical persona far more effectively than the [album's] two-disc split-personality gimmick."
Darryl Sterdan of Jam! called the song single-worthy, and wrote that it is "a tune that actually sounds like a Beyoncé number". Sarah Liss of CBC News wrote that "Single Ladies" represents Beyoncé at her best, describing it as "an instantly addictive a bouncy featherweight dance-pop track". She further commented that it was pleasant hear a voice which "changes timbre naturally, a voice with actual cracks and fissures (however slight)" in contrast to the "Auto-Tune epidemic that seems to be plaguing so many of her mainstream pop peers". Douglas Wolf of "Time" magazine added that "Single Ladies" is a sing-along which allows Beyoncé to demonstrate her virtuosity and "a focused, commanding display of individuality that speaks for every raised hand without a ring on it". Sasha Frere-Jones of "The New Yorker" wrote that the song combines a jumble of feelings and sounds that "don't resolve but also never become tiring". He concluded that "Single Ladies" was generally jubilant and that Beyoncé's vocals were pure and glimmering. Andy Kellman of Allmusic and Jessica Suarez of "Paste" magazine noted the song as one of the standouts from "I Am... Sasha Fierce", and saw similarities to "Get Me Bodied".
Writers praised the song's dance beat; Colin McGuire of PopMatters praised "Single Ladies" as one of Beyoncé's best dance tracks. Spence D. of IGN Music described the song as a "Caribbean flair and booty shaking jubilation that should get even the most staid of listeners snapping their necks and gyrating joyfully". Joey Guerra of the "Houston Chronicle" wrote that it is a "hip-shaking club" song similar to "Check on It". Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" magazine wrote that "Single Ladies" is a "giddy, high-stepping hybrid of lyrical kiss-off and fizzy jump-rope jam". Describing the song as a "winning high-stepping" one, Adam Mazmanian of "The Washington Times" wrote that "Single Ladies" is designed to get the women out on the dance floor as Beyoncé sings it with "a genuinely defiant, independent voice". Some critics were unimpressed by "Single Ladies". Mariel Concepcion of "Billboard" magazine called it "standard screech-thump fare". "The Observer"s Adam Mattera saw "Single Ladies" and "Diva" as potential sources of inspiration for drag queens, although they may leave others confused. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized its lyrical inconsistencies, suggesting it is a "leftover" from "B'Day".

The video had the whole world dancing and waving along via YouTube." VH1 ranked "Single Ladies" at number sixteen on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In his book "Eating the Dinosaur" (2009), Chuck Klosterman wrote that "Single Ladies" is "arguably the first song overtly marketed toward urban bachelorette parties". Jody Rosen of "The New Yorker" credited the melodies that float and dart over the thump for creating a new sound in music that didn't exist in the world before Beyoncé. He further wrote, "If they sound 'normal' now, it's because Beyoncé, and her many followers, have retrained our ears."

Music video.
Background and concept.
The music video for "Single Ladies" was shot immediately after that of "If I Were a Boy", but it received less attention than the "higher-gloss, higher-profile video" for "If I Were a Boy". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including "Crazy in Love" and "Beautiful Liar". "Single Ladies" was choreographed by Frank Gatson and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's "Total Request Live" show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, "Above and Beyoncé", and the platinum edition of "I Am... Sasha Fierce".
Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Entertainment Weekly" that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled "Mexican Breakfast" seen on "The Ed Sullivan Show", which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. "Mexican Breakfast" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's "Walk It Out" was dubbed over the original mix. Beyoncé wanted to attempt a similar dance and eventually, the choreography of "Single Ladies" was liberally adapted from "Mexican Breakfast":
I saw a video on YouTube. dancers had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept a lot of the Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture ... It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.
Beyoncé wanted a simple music video; it was filmed with minimal alternative camera shots and cuts, and no changes to hairstyles, costumes and sets. According to JaQuel Knight, Beyoncé also wanted the video to feel "good and powerful" and include choreography that could be attempted by anybody. The day the video was shot, the song was divided into three parts. Nava deliberately used lengthy shots so that viewers "would connect with the human endeavor of Beyoncé's awe-inspiring dance", with all the changes in looks, angles, and lighting executed live on-camera because he wanted to keep the feel "very organic and un-gimmicky". The styling was inspired by a "Vogue" photo shoot. In the video Beyoncé wears a titanium roboglove designed by her long-time jeweler, Lorraine Schwartz, to complement her alter ego Sasha Fierce. The glove consists of several pieces, including a ring and a separate component that covers Beyoncé's upper arm. She first wore the roboglove on the red carpet at the MTV Europe Music Awards on November 8, 2008. The video shoot took around twelve hours. Many performances of the song were filmed without interruption, and edited together to give the impression that the final video was filmed in a single take.
Synopsis.
In the video for "Single Ladies", emphasis is laid on Beyoncé's more aggressive and sensual side, her alter ego Sasha Fierce. It shows her in an asymmetrical leotard and high-heels, with two look-alike backup dancers, Ebony Williams and Ashley Everett. Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles, designed the high-cut leotards after seeing something similar in the American musical films "A Chorus Line" and "All That Jazz". The dance routine incorporates many styles, including jazz, tap, and hip hop, and is credited with popularizing J-Setting, a flamboyant lead and follow dance style prominent in many African American gay clubs across Atlanta and used by the all-female J-Sette dance troupe of Jackson State University.
The video features Beyoncé and her two companions dancing inside an infinity cove, which alternates between black and white and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film "Sweet Charity". Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.
Response and accolades.
Although the video for "Single Ladies" was the cheapest and quickest of all her videos to produce, Beyoncé felt that it ended up being "the most iconic ... something special". It spawned a dance craze and inspired thousands of imitations all over the world, many of which were posted on YouTube. In an interview with MTV, Beyoncé expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: "It's beautiful to feel you touch people and bring a song to life with a video." Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach. In an interview with Chandler Levack for "Eye Weekly", Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the Internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well as perceived by an audience. Although Cudmore believes that the music video as a medium is "disappearing ... from the mainstream public eye", he accredited "Single Ladies" with its resurgence, and stated that after the video appeared on the Internet, people began to "consciously look for music videos because of its art".
The music video has won several awards and accolades. It was voted Best Dance Routine in the 2008 Popjustice Readers' Poll; and won Video of the Year, Best Choreography, and Best Editing at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The song also won Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. The video has also received many nominations: Best Video in the 2009 Popjustice Readers Polls (placed 4th); nine (including the three that it won) in the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards; Best International Artist Video at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards (losing to Lady Gaga's "Poker Face"); Outstanding Music Video at the 2009 NAACP Image Awards; and two at the 2009 MTV Australia Awards for Best Video and Best Moves. The video was ranked at number four on BET's "Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2008" countdown, and at number three on VH1's Top 40 Videos of 2009. It was voted best music video of the 2000s decade by fans of the music website MUZU TV and fifth-best of the decade by readers of "Billboard" magazine. Claire Suddath of "Time" magazine included it in her 30 All-Time Best Music Videos, writing that "sometimes the best creations are also the simplest". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number one on their list of Beyoncé's ten best music videos writing, "has All of the sex appeal. Ever... Beyoncé doesn't need anything but an empty room in this one. It's all about the dancing. It's all about the leotard. It's all about the fierceness. And it's epic.". The music video was certified platinum by CRIA for shipment of sales 10,000 units. At March 2010, the music video was the second most watched of all time on the Internet with over 522 million views.
"Kanyegate".
"Single Ladies" was nominated for nine awards at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's "You Belong with Me", sparked controversy during the ceremony. Swift's acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West, who grabbed her microphone to declare the "Single Ladies" video as "one of the best videos of all time". Footage of Beyoncé in the audience looking shocked was then shown. When Beyoncé won the Video of the Year award later that night, she reminisced about when she won her first MTV award with her former band, Destiny's Child, and called the experience "one of the most exciting moments in life". She then invited Swift on-stage to finish her speech and "have her moment".
Live performances.
Beyoncé first promoted "Single Ladies" in a concert organized by Power 105.1 radio in New York on October 29, 2008, and subsequently performed the song at various awards ceremonies, concerts and television shows. At the 2008 World Music Awards in Monaco, Beyoncé performed "Single Ladies" while wearing her roboglove, and pointed to the glove as she sang the song's chorus. Beyoncé sang "Single Ladies" on "Saturday Night Live" ("SNL") on November 15, 2008. That night, Beyoncé was featured in a parody of the song's music video, where the two female backup dancers from the video were replaced by pop singer Justin Timberlake and "SNL" cast members Andy Samberg and Bobby Moynihan. On November 16, 2008, Beyoncé performed a medley of "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies", and "Crazy in Love" during the final episode of "Total Request Live".

She delivered a performance of "Single Ladies" with two male dancers on "The Tyra Banks Show" on January 9, 2009.
In July 2009, Beyoncé gave a concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles where American actor Tom Cruise danced with her and her dancers as they performed the dance routine of "Single Ladies". At the MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, Beyoncé performed "Single Ladies" backed by "an army of single ladies" on stage. In a poll conducted by "Billboard" magazine, the performance was ranked as the seventh best in the history of MTV Video Music Awards. A critic wrote in the magazine: "The world gave a collective 'whoa' when Beyonce unleashed her 'Single Ladies' video, but to see those dance moves come to life at the 2009 VMAs was beyond eye-popping." Erika Ramirez of the same publication placed the performance at number two on her list of Beyoncé's five biggest TV performances. "Single Ladies" was included on the set lists of Beyoncé's I Am... Yours concerts and her I Am... World Tour. The song was subsequently included on Beyoncé's live albums "" (2009) and "I Am... World Tour" (2010). "Single Ladies" was later performed by Beyoncé in a pink fringe dress at a concert at Palais Nikaia in Nice, France, on June 20, 2011, and at the Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011, in front of more than 175,000 spectators. On July 1, 2011, Beyoncé gave a free concert on "Good Morning America" as part of its "Summer Concert Series", which included "Single Ladies". Backed by her all-female band and her backing singers The Mamas, Beyoncé performed "Single Ladies" in front of 3,500 people during the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé revue at the Roseland Ballroom in New York, in August 2011. In May, 2012, Beyoncé performed the song during her revue at Revel Atlantic City, a hotel. Ben Ratliff of "The New York Times" mentioned "Single Ladies" in the "almost continuous high point" of the concert. Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote that Beyoncé's dancing during "Single Ladies" reflected the female empowerment theme of the song. On February 3, 2013, Beyoncé performed the song along with her former bandmates from Destiny's Child during the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. The song was added to the set list of her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013). Beyoncé's performed "Single Ladies" at The Sound of Change Live concert on June 1, 2013 at Twickenham Stadium, London as part of the Chime for Change movement.
Cultural impact.
"Single Ladies" gained widespread popularity for its catchy hook and theme of female empowerment. Critics have compared the song to Aretha Franklin's "Respect" and Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive", prompted by their lyrics, which all promote female empowerment. The music video achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment of jazz hands with a wrist twist. It has been credited with starting the "first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet", triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography. Billy Johnson of Yahoo! Music wrote that the video of "Single Ladies" was the top music-related viral hit of 2009. MTV News' James Montgomery wrote that "it appears like music video was custom-made for the YouTube generation, which probably explains why making homages became a worldwide phenomenon." The video generated interest in J-Setting, the dance form that choreographer JaQuel Knight highlights in the video, and Beyoncé is credited with bringing the dance style to the mainstream.
In a radio interview on NPR's "All Things Considered", Knight shared his excitement that the popular video made people want to learn to dance. Trish Crawford from the "Toronto Star" observed how it has appealed to all age groups and genders, in contrast with the short-lived dance craze inspired by Soulja Boy two years before, which she considered "mainly a male hip-hop dance". Crawford mentioned, "Toddlers have tackled 'Single Ladies' dance. have recreation centre dance classes, sorority sisters in their dorm rooms, suburban teenagers in their basements and high school cheerleaders." In February 2009, Columbia Records announced the launch of a "Single Ladies" Dance Video Contest. Fans aged eighteen and older were invited to adhere precisely to the dance routine performed by Beyoncé and her two dancers in the original production. The winning video was included in her live album, "I Am... World Tour".
Parodies and homages.
"Single Ladies" was first parodied in the November 15, 2008, episode of "SNL", which featured Beyoncé. She was initially reluctant to participate in the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. Beyoncé's choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies our work just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, that means it must be big time. So in that respect, I have to take my hat off to them for doing it." Later, Joe Jonas of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo Jedward parodied Beyoncé's dance moves for the video of their cover version of "All the Small Things". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by Beyoncé performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote Trident Unwrapped gum. On November 20, 2009, BBC Newsreaders including Fiona Bruce, Sophie Raworth, Kate Silverton, and Susanna Reid performed "Single Ladies" in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues Bill Turnbull, Ben Brown, Nicholas Owen, and Charlie Stayt before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of "Britain's Got Talent", in a dance-off. They performed the choreography to raise funds for the UK campaign, "Children In Need".
The music video inspired a legion of amateur imitators to post videos of themselves performing the choreography on YouTube. One of the most viewed viral videos is that of Shane Mercado, who appeared on "The Bonnie Hunt Show" in bikini bottoms to perform the choreography. His subsequent meeting with Beyoncé became a media event. Beyoncé has acknowledged the popularity of the videos on YouTube; during her concert tour, excerpts from many of the YouTube videos were played in the background while Beyoncé was performing the song. Cubby, who is an on air personality for Charlotte, North Carolina's 96.1 The Beat AM, based his parody on the "SNL" one. His video lead to a meet and greet with Beyoncé and eventually, an opportunity to join her on stage at a show stop in Atlanta during her I Am... World Tour. Many videos featuring babies of different ages, imitating the dance choreography of "Single Ladies", have been uploaded on YouTube. A video showing Cory Elliott, a baby boy from New Zealand, performing the dance while watching Beyoncé on television, gained significant coverage from several media outlets. "Time" magazine's critic Dan Fletcher ranked it as the fourth best viral video of 2009 and wrote, "Young children love songs with good rhythm and repetition, and 'Single Ladies' certainly has both." However, when a video of seven year-old girls performing choreography from "Single Ladies" at a dance competition in Los Angeles went viral on YouTube, it created a controversy and sparked outrage from many viewers, who felt the girls were sexualized by the suggestive dance moves.
In a video filmed by singer John Legend, US President Barack Obama appears with his wife Michelle performing part of the "Single Ladies" routine. He also briefly performed the hand-twirl move from the song's video at the Obama Inaugural Celebration. This video prompted an Obama look-alike, Iman Crosson, to do his own version of the "Single Ladies" choreography. Several other well-known personalities, including American environmentalist and politician Joe Nation and American actor Tom Hanks, have performed the dance. In the music video for "Dancin on Me" by DJ Webstar and Jim Jones, three females are featured in the background, imitating the "Single Ladies" dance. Wearing a black leotard and gold glove, Katy Brand performed the choreography with two backup female dancers for the final of BBC One's "Let's Dance for Comic Relief" to raise money for the charity Comic Relief on March 12, 2010. Jenna Ushkowitz, Chris Colfer and Heather Morris did the "Single Ladies" dance as part of the Glee Live tour in June 2011. The music minister at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas, thought it would be "an excellent idea" to attract interest in the church choir by using a remix of "Single Ladies" and having choir members dance to it. In the music video he made, the choir members sing, "All the singing ladies, all the singing fellas ... If you like the choir, then won't you come and sing in it." Cyndi Wilkerson, Music Ministry Assistant at Geyer Springs First Baptist Church, uploaded the video to YouTube on August 29, 2011. In April 2013, YouTube phenomenon Psy did the dance routine during a concert in Seoul while wearing a red leotard and red boots.
Usage in media.
"Single Ladies" has been used in various media including television shows, commercials and books. In the Best of 2009 issue of "People" magazine, Khloe, Kim, and Kourtney Kardashian were ranked at number nine on the magazine's list of "25 Most Intriguing People"; the photograph accompanying the article showed the three women in leotards mimicking the look from the "Single Ladies" video. The song has been included in many television shows, including "", "Cougar Town", and in two episodes in "Glee". In the United Kingdom, the video for "Single Ladies" was used for a 2009 television commercial for the new Doner kebab flavored Pot Noodle. In other media, issue 33 of comic book series "The Brave and the Bold" features a scene in which Wonder Woman, Zatanna, and Barbara Gordon sing a karaoke version of the song while at a club. A mash-up video of the theme of "Single Ladies" and "The Andy Griffith Show" circulated on the Internet in early 2010. It was produced by Party Ben at the end of 2008. In July 2010, the line "Put a Ring on It" was used by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS as the tagline for a female condom public awareness campaign in the US.
Cover versions.
Singers and bands of various genres have covered the song in their own style. Scottish band Marmaduke Duke performed a cover version in April 2009 on BBC Radio 1's "Live Lounge" show. In October 2009, it was released on "Radio 1's Live Lounge – Volume 4", a compilation of "Live Lounge" recordings. Australian singer Stan Walker sang a jazzier version of the song on the seventh series of "Australian Idol" in October 2009. The same year, elementary school group PS22 chorus covered "Single Ladies" and "Halo" (2009) during "Billboard"s annual Women In Music luncheon held at The Pierre in New York City. In her short-lived Broadway revue "All About Me" in March 2010, Dame Edna Everage performed a version of the song with backup dancers Gregory Butler and Jon-Paul Mateo. It was also covered by Jeff Tweedy and British singer-songwriter Alan Pownall. According to Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Entertainment Weekly", Tweedy sang only a few bars; he gave "Single Ladies" an acoustic feel and recited the rest of the song's lyrics. He performed the hand movements that Beyoncé and her dancers do in the song's video. Pomplamoose, an American indie music duo consisting of Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn, recorded a cover of "Single Ladies" on video, which makes use of split screens to show Dawn on vocals and Conte playing the instruments.

They chose "Single Ladies" as they believed that it would help them grow their audience.
During a concert at New York's Madison Square Garden, Prince performed a mash-up of his 1984 songs "Pop Life" and "I Would Die For You, incorporating a sample of "Single Ladies". During her tour in Melbourne, Australia, on August 13, 2010, Katy Perry performed "Single Ladies" and attempted to emulate the choreography. English composer of classical music Mark-Anthony Turnage composed a setting of the song which he titled "Hammered Out". Describing it as his "most R&B work to date", Turnage told Tim Rutherford-Johnson of "The Guardian" that he was motivated to put the "Single Ladies" reference in his work by his young son, a fan of the song. The piece premiered at the BBC Proms on August 27, 2010. Sara Bareilles covered the song as part of "Billboard"s "Mashup Mondays" and performed it as part of her set list on the 2010 Lilith Fair Tour. As stated by a critic writing for the magazine, Bareilles put "a piano-pop" twist on "Single Ladies" and turned it "into a slow, jazzy track, complete with creeping bassline and vocal harmonies". American rock band A Rocket to the Moon covered "Single Ladies" and placed it on their EP, "The Rainy Day Sessions", which was released in October 2010.
On September 26, 2010, Kharizma sang their version of the song on the second series of "The X Factor Australia", and on May 31, 2011, Matthew Raymond-Barker sang the song live on the seventh prime of the second series of the "X Factor France".

The Chipettes attempted the Bob Fosse-styled choreography. Billy Johnson of Yahoo! Music commented that for the first time the movie includes a performance he wanted to watch, and concluded, "this is definitely one of the best 'Single Ladies' parodies. It is worth it just to see the squirrels singing." The film "Sex and the City 2" features a performance of the song by American singer and actress Liza Minnelli. On October 18, 2011, Young Men Society sang "Single Ladies" on the third series of "The X Factor Australia".

Merck headquarters

The Merck headquarters building is a modernist office building located in the Whitehouse Station section of Readington Township, New Jersey. It was designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates, LLC in the late 1980s for the Merck pharmaceutical company. Over the years it has become well known for its various environmentally friendly features.
On October 9, 2012, Merck announced that it would move its headquarters to the former Schering-Plough site in Kenilworth, New Jersey starting in 2014 and plans to close the Whitehouse Station headquarters building after completion of the move in 2015.
Building history.
Constructed in 1990 as a home for the headquarters staff of Merck, the building is most recognizable for its hexagon shape and its nature setting. The main building was constructed with a wide clearing at its center, filled with old-growth trees saved during the construction phase. Further, Merck placed the parking structure underground and created a temporary nursery on-site for the trees removed during construction, in order to make the facility a "corporate cottage in the woods". The building was originally set on of property and has since been expanded to a campus with auxiliary buildings. The initial site plan foresaw the subsequent addition of two buildings to create a grid of three connected hexagons, however, after a change in management, it was indicated that further construction in the original style would not occur. Instead a conventional office block was built adjacent to it known as "Whitehouse Station West".
In the center of the building there is a park with a small lawned sitting area containing a statue given by Merck Germany.
Prior to moving to its current location, the Merck headquarters was located in Rahway, New Jersey. The White House Station campus is located on an old dairy farm and the surrounding area is known as a more suburban/rural setting than the area around the Rahway campus. As a result, Merck included amenities such as on-site child-care, a fitness center, baseball fields, and a medical services center for employees.
Solar initiative.
In 2008, Merck installed a 1.6-megawatt solar power system consisting of 7,000 panels on of property. Among the largest installations at a corporate headquarters, the system is also the largest ground-mounted solar power tracking system east of the Mississippi River. In all, it will provide 7% of the site's power and is expected to "reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1,300 tons per year."

Beachmaster Unit Two

Beachmaster Unit Two (BMU-2) is a United States Navy amphibious beach party unit based at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Little Creek, Virginia. Since 1949, BMU-2 has been involved in major amphibious exercises and operations in Lebanon, Cuba, Grenada, Desert Storm, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.
Mission.
Beachmaster Unit Two is assigned the mission of providing tactical components in support of amphibious operations. BMU-Two provides Naval Beach Party Teams (BPTs) for deployment in conjunction with Expeditionary Forces in order to provide beach and surf zone salvage and to facilitate the landing and movement over the beach of troops, equipment, supplies, and the evacuation of casualties, prisoners-of-war, and non-combatants.
History.
BMU-2 can trace its history back to the days of World War II. Early on during the Second World War, it quickly became apparent that the orderly flow of troops, equipment, and supplies across the assault beaches was an essential element to the success of amphibious operations. It also became obvious that some special organization was needed to effect and coordinate mass movement through the surf zone and onto the hostile shore. To accomplish this task, small units called Beach Party Teams were formed. They were trained at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Virginia, and deployed commencing in September 1942. The Beach Party Battalions went forward to participate in amphibious landing in the European and African theaters.
In August 2011, the commander of the unit, Commander Robert M. Brown, was removed after an investigation substantiated allegations of misuse of government resources.
In early September 2011 BMU-2 made its first ever air deployment to assist in the USS Bataan's ARG deployment.

Lissotes latidens

Lissotes latidens, commonly known as the Wielangta stag beetle or broad-toothed stag beetle, is a species of stag beetle which is only found in an area centred in Wielangta Forest in eastern Tasmania. It is one of the rarest animals in Australia. 
The broad-toothed stag beetle has been recorded at less than 40 sites, scattered across an area of , since it was first discovered in 1871. It lives and breeds in moist decaying wood underneath logs on the ground. It has no wings, and it is likely that it moves no further than tens of metres throughout its life. Stag beetles are an ancient lineage thought to have evolved with the dinosaurs over 200 million years ago. In a 2006 study some 121 logs were rolled, only 2 broad-toothed stag beetles were observed, out of a total of some 106 beetles. It is threatened by bulldozing and burning, because this disturbs leaf litter and logs,removes old trees and dries out the forest by removal of the canopy. It was listed as a threatened species on 3 December 2002.

Stephaton

Stephaton, or Steven, is the name given in medieval Christian traditions to the Roman soldier, unnamed in the Bible, who offered Jesus a sponge soaked in vinegar wine at the Crucifixion. In later depictions of the Crucifixion, Stephaton is frequently portrayed with Longinus, the name given to the soldier who pierced Jesus' side with a spear.
Gospel accounts.
The account of Jesus receiving a sponge soaked in vinegar while on the cross appears in all four of the canonical gospels, with some variation. In both and , just after Jesus says "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me", a stander by soaks a sponge in vinegar and raises it on a reed for Jesus to drink. mentions that the attendant soldiers offer Jesus vinegar while mocking him – moving the mocking motif that occurs earlier in Mark and Matthew to the Crucifixion. In , Jesus declares "I thirst" (one of his last words) and is given the vinegar-soaked sponge "on hyssop". The significance of the act is unclear, though it is usually interpreted as an act of mercy on the part of the soldiers. The episode may allude to Psalm 68:22: "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink."
Later tradition.
The soldier who offered Jesus the sponge is often paired with Longinus, the name later given to the unnamed soldier who pierced Christ's side with a spear during the Crucifixion. It is not known when or how the name "Stephaton" originated for this character, though it had become common well before the end of the first millennium.
Stephaton is a particularly common figure in medieval Irish art. In depictions of the Crucifixion, he was regularly shown alongside Longinus, with their actions shown simultaneously, though in the Biblical narrative, these took place at different times in the Biblical narrative (Stephaton's occurs before Jesus' death, Longinus' occurred after.) Colum Hourihane and others suggest the images should not be read as a simple narrative, but rather a mix of symbolism and representation typical of medieval art.

Star Time (TV series)

Star Time is an American variety series which aired on the DuMont Television Network from September 5, 1950 to February 27, 1951, and starred singer-actress Frances Langford. (The 1950-51 US network TV grid below shows the hour-long show as airing both Sundays at 7pm EST and Tuesdays at 10pm EST.)
Broadcast history.
The hour-long comedy-variety show spotlighted several regulars and guest performers. One feature of each telecast was a lengthy skit, written and directed by Philip Rapp, with Langford and Lew Parker performing as The Bickersons, a quarrelsome married couple that migrated from radio as a distinctively-unhappy sitcom man and wife. 
With Langford as a first-class singer, music was an integral component of the series. The premier telecast spotlighted The Harmonicats, a trio of versatile harmonica players who had achieved great prominence in the 1940s. But the program soon settled on a regular slot called Club Goodman in which the Benny Goodman Sextet -- with Goodman, Teddy Wilson, and Terry Gibbs, among others -- played jazz arrangements of popular songs.
With Wilson's weekly appearances, "Star Time" became one of the first sponsored national TV series to offer an African-American performer as a cast regular.
Episode status.
The UCLA Film and Television Archive has four complete episodes, along with excerpts from a fifth episode.
The J. Fred and Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the Library of Congress contains five half-hour segments of "Star Time", including the first half-hour of the premiere telecast which featured The Harmonicats; plus an opening half-hour of another show; and three closing half-hour segments highlighting the Benny Goodman Sextet as well as The Bickersons skits.
