List of The Power of Five characters

This is a list of all the antagonists and protagonists in The Power of Five series by Anthony Horowitz.
The only characters to physically appear in all five novels to date are Matt Freeman, Richard Cole, Nathalie Johnson and the King of the Old Ones.
Protagonists.
Matt Freeman.
Matt is the first of the Five and the leader of the Five, and is the main protagonist in the first two novels "Raven's Gate" and "Evil Star". He did reappear in the third novel "Nightrise" but only very briefly when Scott and Jamie Tyler appeared in the Nazca Desert, the place where Matt and Pedro were staying in Professor Chamber's "hacienda". Matt is not the main protagonist in book four as that is left to Scarlett Adams (who is the fifth of the Five) but he makes a bigger appearance than he did in "Nightrise". 
Matt's powers are telekinesis, as well as clairvoyance; his powers are stronger when he is with another of the five but it has also proven to be unstoppable with just extreme will. When he activates his power he can smell burnt toast, as this is what he could smell the day his parents died. This is first shown when he tries to steal from a warehouse in Ipswich and senses the security guard. He always blames himself for not warning his parents the accident which would occur for he knew his parents would not believe him. He regretted not doing damage to the car such as pouring paint over it or slashing a car tire to prevent them from going out in the car. 
Matt and Lohan land in Brazil after the Hong Kong tsumani and, due to the fact that they need money, Lohan sells Matt on the slave market, takes the money and then saves Matt. Having read his life book in the dreamworld library, Matt knows what he has to do and tells Lohan that they need to head for Antartica where the Old Ones hold a base called Oblivion. After Scott's betrayal, he decides to meet him himself along with Richard and they are captured and tortured by the Old Ones. However, knowing what needs to be done, Richard kills Matt who is then replaced by his old self from the past. When Scott also dies, Flint also arrives from the past and the Five successfully defeat the Old Ones once again. Matt and Scott are later buried side by side in Oblivion by Richard and the remaining Five. 
Matt is described as being muscular but slim and very good looking. It describes Matt in the book as having the look of a male model or a footballer or like many both. He has dark hair that is for most of the books cut short. His eyes are often described as being an intense, vivid blue in colour. His past incarnation is also called Matt as he preferred the name better. 
He was paired with Lohan and went to Belem, Brazil when he went through the door in the Tai Shan Temple.
Matt can communicate with other four in a dream world. The dream world is on a beach in neither day nor night.
Pedro.
Pedro is the second of the Five and is first introduced in the second book, "Evil Star". Pedro lived as a beggar in Lima, Peru.
Pedro began life in a small village in the Canta province. When he was young the River Chillón burst its banks and Pedro's family were killed. A group of survivors travelled with Pedro to Lima. Pedro eventually ended up in the care of a man named Sebastian with many other children. He lived there performing tricks to people passing by and robbing rich tourists. However, he then met Matthew Freeman and travelled with him.
Pedro also bears a strong resemblance to Manco Cápac, the founder of the Inca Empire. Pedro's power is healing. He could heal people by being around them. He only realised his power at the end of "Evil Star" when he helped Matt after he was injured by Chaos, the King of the Old Ones. He discovered that during the stay
with his carer Sebastian in "Ciudad del Veneno", known as "Poison Town" in English, none of the people around him got sick due to his healing abilities, and when Matt slept at the house where Pedro lived he noticed his scars from a previous fight had vanished. 
He is described as being extremely skinny with long dark brown hair and brown eyes. His past incarnation is named Inti. Pedro is 14 years old in "Evil Star" and "Nightrise", but is then 15 in "Necropolis". He had tried to heal Scott after Susan Mortlake tortured him by trying to control him but could not as the scars of the wound were too deep. By the time of "Necropolis", he had learned enough of the English language to be able to communicate with the other four gatekeepers. 
He went through the doorway in the Tai Shan Temple by himself, and he ended up in Italy with Scott.
Pedro can communicate with the other four of the five in the dream world.
Jamie and Scott Tyler.
Jamie and Scott Tyler, twins, are two of the Five (Jamie being the third and Scott being the fourth) and are the main protagonists in the third book in the Power of Five series "Nightrise". At the beginning of the novel, Jamie and Scott are working in a dingy theatre in Reno, Nevada, USA, under the whim of their "Uncle Don" who is not really their uncle, but Jamie and Scott are forced to call him that. After a performance Scott is kidnapped and both physically and mentally tortured by the sinister Nightrise Corporation at a juvenile prison called Silent Creek. Jamie is rescued by Alicia McGuire and creates a plan to save Scott. Along the way he is catapulted into the past and witnesses the first battle against the Old Ones. Sapling, Jamie's former self, was killed by the Old Ones, hence he was 'replaced' by Jamie. At the end of the novel Jamie and Scott are united with Matt and Pedro. 
Jamie and Scott's power is telepathy and they have the power to control other people and make them abide by the instructions given by the twins, as well as being able to read each other's thoughts automatically. Jamie has shown in Nightrise that he doesn't like using his powers. The twins are described as being very skinny (to the point of being malnourished) with long black hair (they are Native American) and dark eyes. Both of them have cut their hair by the time they are reunited.
Their past incarnations are Sapling (Jamie) and Flint (Scott). Matt had stated that Scott's past incarnation name, Flint, suited him for Scott had a hard look around him and a type of cruelty. He was supposedly angry when Matt split him and Jamie apart for the twins had never been so far apart. Matt stated that he thought Scott could not be trusted yet. Jamie and Scott are both fourteen years old in "Nightrise", but are fifteen in "Necropolis". In "Necropolis", it shows that Jamie is now more in charge of the two, as Scott is very withdrawn and quiet. Scott also shuts down when in stress. The reason was that he was thoroughly programmed while held captive by the Nightrise agents in Nevada, USA. Nightrise stated at the start of "Necropolis" that it was possible to turn Scott against his friends. 
Scott goes traitor in the final book and as soon as they arrive in Italy he puts Pedro in a cell and breaks his finger. Scott then joins the Old Ones and is taught by Jonas Mortlake, son of Susan Mortlake, who tortured him. So Scott joins the enemy. He is given "luxury" in the fortress of Oblivion which seems luxurious but has a habit of turning to maggot-ridden meat and freezing rooms in seconds. It seems to be connected to whenever he is thinking of grim things. So he decides to contact Jamie. He summons Matt to the fortress under pretense of repentance, but actually betrays Matt. Scott then suddenly redeems himself when he hears Matt being tortured and he opens the locked doors, killing himself, and he gets in Jamie inside you. He dies and I am blaxk lixarrek
The twins went through the doorway together in the Tai Shan Temple.
They can communicate with each other and the other members of the five in a dream world.
Scarlett Adams.
Scarlett is the fifth of the Five and is the main protagonist in the fourth book "Necropolis". She had a close friend named Aidan(In the books it never claimed to be her boyfriend.) Scarlett is English, and was adopted in New York, British from an orphanage there. She lives in Dulwich. Her adopted parents are Vannessa, who ran a holiday company that put together packages in China and Far East and Paul Adams, who specialised in international business law. Her mother is described as tall, blonde and elegant while her father is described as having the looks of a lawyer with greying hair, a round face and glasses. She bears a strong resemblance, and is described by some, as Lin Mo, the Chinese goddess of the sea. Scarlett's father Paul works for the Nightrise Corporation, at the end of "Nightrise" she leaves on a flight to Hong Kong. 
Scarlett's power is controlling the weather. Scarlett's power was at first thought to be predicting the weather but is proven that she could also control it when she summons a dragon typhoon to escape after she gets captured. This is also noted in Nightrise as Scar summons a rainstorm to mask Inti's arrival. Scarlett is described as being of average height, slim, and being [Asian/Eurasian] She also has long black hair, strange bright green eyes and has the soft brown skin of a girl born in Asia. She is also said to have a winning smile, that has gotten her out of trouble on many occasions. Matt also claims that she is very good-looking and kisses her in Oblivion.
While her parents are out working, Scarlett is taken care of by a Scottish woman, Mrs Christina Murdoch. She is short, dark-haired and seemed to have no sense of humour at all. Scarlett and Mrs Murdoch had agreed silently that they were never going to be friends although they got on well enough. 
Scarlett is known to act before she thinks, like when she pushed a teacher (who couldn't swim) fully clothed into the school's swimming pool. Scarlett is shown as brave throughout Necropolis. 
Her past life is name was also Scarlett, but often called Scar.
At the end of Necropolis, Scarlett is shot in the head by a Nightrise agent. She is then paired with Richard Cole when they go through the door. She is later recovered when she reaches Egypt and then goes to Dubai with Richard and goes to Oblivion
She can communicate with the others when she's asleep in a strange dreamworld.
Richard Cole.
Richard Cole is a journalist first introduced in "Raven's Gate" where he helps Matt Freeman out with his troubles with the heartless Jayne Deverill. He was a journalist for the "Greater Malling Gazette" in Greater Malling, Yorkshire, living in York. At the end of the novel Richard pushes Deverill in a pool of radioactive acid when she tries to crush Matt with a windpipe. 
In the second novel, "Evil Star", Richard left his job as a journalist for the "Greater Malling Gazette" and worked on another newspaper, "The Gipton Echo". He agrees to go to Peru with Matt and gets separated from Matt when their taxi from the airport was ambushed by the Incas, who were actually preventing them from being captured by the police. He stays at Vilcabamba, the lost city of the Incas, and reunites with Matt who went to the Nazca Lines to find the second gate. 
He does not appear much in "Nightrise", though he does appear briefly. But in "Necropolis", he makes a bigger appearance when he goes with Matt and Jamie to London to try to find Scarlett Adams, the last of the Five, and then goes to Hong Kong with them via Macau before they are attacked and separated. He reunites with the Five at the Tai Shan Temple. He is then paired with Scarlett when he went through the door in the Tai Shan Temple. 
In "Oblivion", Richard and a severely-injured Scarlett arrive through the door under the pyramids in Egypt. However, due to the ten years that had passed because of the door's malfunction, the country is now ingulfed in a civil war between the military government dominated by the Old Ones and a group of freedom fighters led and funded by the Nexus. He later encounters a teen girl named Holly, who Jamie met at St Boltoph's in England. Richard and Holly help the Gatekeepers defeat the Old Ones in the battle at Oblivion; and eventually Richard and Holly marry. The Gatekeepers return to the Dreamworld to live, and Richard and Holly wait for their chance to permanently live there.
At university Richard studied journalism, politics and the history of geography. In "Necropolis", his knowledge of historical maps helped him to decode St Joseph's diary and find out where the Gatekeeper's portals are.
The Librarian.
The Librarian is a very mysterious character, so far having only appeared in "Necropolis." He is first introduced when Matt explores the Dreamworld and in the process discovers and enters a Library. The Librarian, as his name suggests, is the master of the Library, which he calls "the Great Library." The motive of the Librarian is obscure; he simply seems to catalogue and record the lives of every being which has ever lived. He has a collection of the lives of all the humans on Earth, in the form of books which record "their beginnings, their marriages, their good days and their bad days, their deaths - of course. Everything they ever did." The Librarian knows all about the Gatekeepers, and is seemingly there to help them combat the Old Ones, although when questioned, he often gives vague and obscure answers. Such is his power that he may in fact be the opposite of Chaos, the King of the Old Ones.
Physically, the Librarian appears as a short, elderly man, (barely five foot high) with white robes, a silk red jacket, with gray hair, gray eyes and a face which looks as if it has been carved. He looks like an Arab. A beard would suit him but he is clean-shaven.
At the end of the fifth and final novel, "Oblivion," the victorious Gatekeepers return to the Dreamworld and all enter the Library. The Librarian appears, yet he has a woman with him this time. To all the Gatekeepers she resembles their races. So to Jamie and Scott, she appeares Native American; to Scarlett, she is Asian, to Pedro, she is Incan, and to Matt, she is his mother, as she was on the day of her death. All this suggests the Librarian is also Matt's father, and thus the father of the Five Gatekeepers.
The Nexus.
The Nexus is a highly secret group of powerful and influential people with some link to the supernatural world who prevent the Old Ones re-entering planet Earth. They tell Matt that he is one of the Gatekeepers in "Raven's Gate" and help Matt and Pedro with the gate's whereabouts in "Evil Star". In "Nightrise", only one member of the Nexus, Natalie Johnson, appears near the end of the book. She helps Jamie and Scott Tyler escape after a near assassination of a presidential candidate in Auburn, California. 
There are always 12 members in the Nexus. However in "Raven's Gate" one of them, Professor Sanjay Dravid, is killed by a pterosaur and in "Evil Star", Fabian, another member of the Nexus, is shot by Captain Rodriguez of the Peruvian police service. 
The Nexus are not specifically named, but the members of the Nexus who are mentioned in "Necropolis" are: 
Superintendent Stephen Mallory.
A black superintendent who appeares solely in "Raven's Gate," Mallory is in charge of interviewing Matthew Freeman after the police arrest him on suspicion of murder. Mallory interviews both Matthew and his partner-in-crime Kelvin, and although Kelvin claims Matthew started the whole theft and "killed" a policeman, Mallory also interviews the police officer who Kevin claimed was dead, and from him learns that Matthew, although involved, was innocent as he wanted to save the guard. Mallory is puzzled as to why Matthew should have become a criminal, as to him Matthew seems very polite, intelligent, and moral, unlike the other thugs he usually deals with. Mallory is suspicious of Matthew's foster-mother, Jayne Deverill, from the beginning, and his suspicions about her deepen when he learns of the "suicide" of a criminal near his police center and feels Jayne Deverill was involved. He learns about Matthew's precognitive powers from his neighbour, and then learns of another death reported by Matthew. He immediately feels Matthew is in immediate danger from Jayne Deverill and visits Matthew on the farm, but Jayne Deverill is openly hostile to Mallory. Mallory tells Jayne Deverill that she is unfit for guardianship and that he is removing Matthew from her. He tells Matthew that within a day he will return and rescue him, but on the way home, his radio breaks and picks up a faint EVP. Mallory tries to change channel, but all the channels have the same EVP. Now frightened, Mallory can't slow down. His car speeds up and hurtles him off a bridge into a lorry which both explode, killing the superintendent.
Later, it is revealed that Mallory's death was orchestrated by the cult of villagers from Lesser Malling, as he stood in their way to kill Matthew.
Tom Burgess.
Tom Burgess is a farmer who works at Lesser Malling. He has his own farm, which is a stark contrast to Jayne Deverill's farm; Matt notes how clean and welcoming it is. Tom first appears when Jayne Deverill has sent Matt to buy a potion from the chemist and he initially appears menacing; he grabs Matt's shoulder and tells him Matt shouldn't be in the village and warns him to get out immediately, and says Matt is in danger. Matt is confused but becomes more unnerved when he hears noises at the local power station, Omega One, which is derelict, at night. Matt stumbles upon the power station in the woods the next day and bumps into Tom Burgess when he, Matt, is hopelessly lost. Tom tells him again he should leave, and begins to tell Matt about the black magic being conducted in the town. Tom Burgess then goes mad with fear and shoots Asmodeus, Jayne Deverill's cat, dead, knowing it is spying on them. Tom Burgess tells Matt to come to his farm the next day at nine in the morning and together they will leave. Tom then gives Matt a necklace with an image of a key engraved in stone, saying it will undo the black magic which keeps Matt from finding the right path. To Matt's surprise, this symbol does unlock the black magic. Matt has more nightmares that night but arrives at Tom Burgess' farm the next morning as Tom Burgess told him to, but despite the attractive, welcoming outer exterior of the farmhouse, the interior is a mess, as if a whirlwind has hit it. Soon, Matt finds Tom Burgess dead in his bedroom, his legs bent and broken. This is also where Matt first finds out about Raven's Gate, as Tom has scrawled it on the wall in green paint. Matt rushes out and soon finds some police, who soon begin to doubt him when they find the place neat and tidy again and several workers and one of the witches from the village doing housekeeping. The police threaten to arrest Matt again if he continues telling them stories like this. The next night, Jayne Deverill arranges for a phone call for Matt, and he is immensely disturbed to hear the dead farmer, Tom Burgess, on the other end.
Atoc.
Atoc was an Inca who successfully tried to save Matt and Pedro in a helicopter over the Nazca desert when Salamanda shot it with a gun, spinning it out of control.After being shot,the helicopter crashes and Atoc is killed by the propeller of the helicopter
The Incas.
The Incas appear in "Evil Star" when Matt and Pedro travel to the Inca City Vilacamba in Peru. They also appear in "Necropolis" where they fight the zombies destroying Professor Chambers' "hacienda".
The Native Americans.
The Native Americans aid Jamie in "Nightrise" by rescuing him from Silent Creek prison. A Native American by the name of Joe Feather has said that Jamie and Scott have Native blood in their veins, and that the tribes of America will always be ready to help the Five. When Jamie is injured by security guards at Silent Creek an Indian shaman revives him at the camp where Feather's tribe live.
Alicia McGuire.
Alicia McGuire is a black woman with dark hair and she is involved with politics, being an advisor to Senator John Trelawney before her son Danny was kidnapped. When she lost her son she got off work but the government were good enough to give her money each month even though she wasn't working. This was mainly to fund her search for Danny but also for survives. She looked all over the state for Danny and contacted everyone she could. Finally she found an enormous corporation, Nightrise and then she managed to contact them but found out they were responsible for Danny's abduction. She had been looking up on missing children all year and finally found a pattern in the abductions, linking them with the Nightrise Corporation.
Later on she heard about the psychic twins, Scott and Jamie, and went to a production to see them in person. She stood up in the middle of the act, asking them if they really were psychic, and asked Scott where her son was, she held up a picture of Danny. Scott looked into Alicia's mind and said yes, Danny was alive, but he was suffering and it was Alicia's fault. Later on, Nightrise came for Scott and Jamie, but they only got Scott. Alicia came up and rescued Jamie, foiling Nightrise by making them unable to get her number plate. But they framed Jamie for killing his step parents.
So Alicia almost became Jamie's guardian. They met up with Senator John Trelawney, and he got Jamie into into Silent Creek prison to get out Scott and Danny but found that Scott was in a more private sector of Nighrise. So Jamie broke out, but only with Danny, and then they reunited Danny with Alicia. Jamie realized his dream prophecies meant that John Trelawney would be killed by Scott at his hometown on his party, so he told Alicia and they raced to the town Auburn to save Trelawney, but Scott ignored Jamie even with telepathy and so Jamie got a security guard to shoot the assassin, Susan Mortlake, and thus saved Trelawney. Then Alicia took Jamie and Scott away from there but the police tracked them down. She got them away and let Jamie and Scott go but then the police turned up and questioned Alicia. Alicia saved Jamie and Scott by saying she had never met them and demanded to talk to Trelawney, and thus we can assume had had better things to do than not let her off.
Han Shan-tung.
Also known as "The Master of the Mountain", Han Shan-tung is the leader of the Chinese Triad White Lotus Society, first appearing in "Necropolis". Matt and Jamie along with Richard Cole are guests in his household in "Necropolis", but over dinner he tells them that he can smuggle them into Hong Kong, ( which is where Scarlet is being held captive)but only if Matt can prove he is one of the Five, as he claims to be. The test Han Shan Tung has in mind is a sword ladder- a series of razor sharp blades strung together on wires creating 19 steps up to a balcony. Although Richard begs him not to, Matt goes into a self-induced trance and is able to climb the ladder without injury apart from a cut in his palm that had been the result of a false start. Han Shan Tung seems surprised that Matt actually succeeded and agrees to find them a passage into Hong Kong by ship.
Lohan Shan-tung.
White Lotus Society Triad member and son of Han Shan-tung, Lohan is responsible for saving Scarlett from the shape-changers and the Nightrise Organization. He sent the bugged jade necklace given to Scarlett on an aeroplane to Australia in the hopes of luring the Old Ones away. He then found Richard and Jamie, and set up the operation to break Matt and Scarlett out of Victoria Prison. 
At the end of "Necropolis" when all of the Gatekeepers and their supporters were separated, he was paired with Matt and went to Belem, Brazil.
Professor Joanna Chambers.
Professor Joanna Chambers is an expert on the history, geography and culture of Peru and the Nazca lines, introduced in "Evil Star". She helps Matt, Pedro and Richard with their exploration of Peru for the second gate, and later they stay at her "Hacienda" (Farm)
In "Nightrise" she does not appear significantly, but in "Necropolis" she makes a more important appearance. She has been looking after Richard and the male Gatekeepers for four months and celebrates them leaving as they have constantly interrupted her research. However they are attacked by a small army of zombies who destroy her house and wound her. She later on dies of internal bleeding.
Senator John Trelawny.
Senator John Trelawny is Alicia McGuire's boss and one of the two main candidates for the presidency of the United States along with Charles Baker. While Baker has the support of the Nightrise Corporation, Trelawny is young, popular and charismatic and is in the lead for the presidency.
He helps Jamie Tyler get into the Silent Creek prison and is also investigating Nightrise for several stories of corruption. He is the target of Susan Mortlake's plan and is nearly assassinated by one of his guards who is under Scott Tyler's control. Jamie uses his own power to save the senator.
It is later revealed that Trelawny lost the election possibly due to rigged votes. A vast majority of Americans are very displeased by Trelawny's defeat and took to the streets to denounce what they believe was a fraudulent election.
Commander David Cain.
Commander Cain is the commanding officer on the US naval ship "US Pole Star" after leaving his base in Florida he travelled south to Antartica where he nominates himself as leader of the World Army, a ragtag group of survives with the sole aim of defeating the Old Ones. However his time in charge of the World Army is not a success, and though meaning well ends up killing half of his troops with a failed attack on the fortress where Chaos and the Old Ones are based.
Antagonists.
The Old Ones.
The Old Ones are a group of creatures that the Five will one day battle in the present day. They were defeated for the first time by the Gatekeepers when they were all together 10,000 years before. The Old Ones are led by a creature called Chaos, who first appears in "Raven's Gate" as the primary antagonist, alongside Sir Michael Marsh and Jayne Deverill, who were working for Chaos. Chaos was the cause of the near-destruction of Earth before the Dark Ages where Jamie Tyler is catapulted to in "Nightrise", where he meets the Old Ones in their previous forms. The forms that the Old Ones take towards the end of "Evil Star" are deformed and monstrous creatures which centre mainly on the creatures in the Nazca Lines in Peru. The Old Ones are capable of finding people who share the same views as them and giving them extra powers and plans for world destruction. However, at the end it is revealed that those people cannot destroy the world "themselves" - they have to die with the rest of humanity, because humanity is doomed and the Old Ones are the true masters of destruction. The Old Ones make an appearance in both Evil Star and Nightrise, although in Nightrise their presence is mainly due to the flashback wherein the Gatekeepers eradicate them. Despite these brief appearances, the Old Ones are the primary antagonists in "The Power of Five", and their influence is felt throughout the series.
The Old Ones first appear in Chapter 15 of "Raven's Gate", mentioned by Professor Sanjay Dravid of the Nexus. The Nexus has been created to combat the Old Ones, and make sure the world remains safer whilst the Old Ones are kept in their prison. The only Old One to make a physical appearance in this book is Chaos, who attempts to escape from Raven's Gate with the assistance of the witches of Lesser Malling and the human antagonist, Sir Michael Marsh. Chaos kills Marsh when he comes out of his prison, taking the form of a huge black creature with webbed fingers. Chaos is then pulled back into Raven's Gate by radiation when the nuclear reactor beneath the Gate explodes and then he is not seen again until the events of "Evil Star", where another Gate is opening, this time in Peru.
The Old Ones' presence is felt throughout "Evil Star", but only at the end are they actually seen in physical form. The four main creatures in the Old Ones' army are a giant hummingbird, a massive condor, a giant spider, and a huge monkey. There are also thirteen fire riders who form the Old Ones' cavalry, and several other deformed creatures: a huge toad with the head of a bird, an alligator on legs, a pig the size of a horse, and several strange, ethereal creatures. They also seem to possess an army of soldiers made up of flies. The Old Ones escape from their prison and meet two Gatekeepers, Pedro and Matt Freeman. Pedro is unable to confront them due to an injury caused by a plane crash. Matt tries to fend off the Old Ones, and almost wins, but he realizes that he doesn't have enough power for he is one of the Five and all of them are needed to defeat the Old Ones. Matt falls unconscious allowing the Old Ones to escape led by Chaos. Just like the Old Ones possessed three giant dogs in Raven's Gate (although these could have been created by Jayne Deverill as none of the Old Ones had been released yet), in this book they possess several giant condors, which guard the Gate in the Nazca Desert, thus explaining the Inca's prophecy: "The birds fly where they should not fly."
In "Nightrise", the Old Ones have escaped. They are assisting Nightrise Corporation in order to find the Gatekeepers, and Nightrise capture two: Jamie and Scott Tyler. Diego Salamanda has failed to capture Matt and Pedro, and Nightrise is also trying to look for them, and also the fifth Gatekeeper, Scarlett Adams, appears in the past when Jamie Tyler is shot while escaping the prison Silent Creek, dying temporarily and going back to the past, where he replaces his previous incarnation, Sapling, in order to destroy the Old Ones. The Old Ones rule the world in the past, and they seem invincible, to the point of actually killing a Gatekeeper. However, they don't know that when a gatekeeper dies he is replaced by his future self, and so they ignore the fact that Jamie has replaced Sapling. A brief battle follows with the Old Ones in which the Gatekeepers meet up and defeat the Old Ones, expelling them to another dimension. After this, two Gates are built to keep them out: one in Peru and one in Yorkshire, where the first battle was fought. However, they break out in "Evil Star", which Jamie sees in his dreams in Silent Creek Prison.
In "Necropolis", the Old Ones have seized control of Hong Kong in China, as this is where the ultimate headquarters of the Nightrise Corporation is situated. From Hong Kong, the Old Ones are spreading a fascist government across the world, commencing their new empire. Anyone who criticizes the government is eliminated, and anyone who informs people about the possession of Hong Kong also dies. In other words, the Old Ones have seized control of Hong Kong, and are possessing multitudes of its civilians, from the government to the police and the street cleaners. As the main plan of the Old Ones is to destroy humanity, they are slowly killing off all the surviving inhabitants of Hong Kong - the inhabitants who have not criticized the government or informed their relatives of the new regime - by infecting the atmosphere with a poisonous gas which resembles green acid, and this slowly sucks the life out of the living inhabitants. In "Necropolis", the Old Ones have discovered the Fifth of the Gatekeepers: Scarlett Adams. They now need to trap her in Hong Kong, their city, and lure the other Gatekeepers into the same trap. This they succeed in doing, only to have the Gatekeepers escape at the last moment and Scarlett creating a typhoon which ultimately destroys Hong Kong, the Necropolis. Once the Old Ones have separated the Gatekeepers, they leave Hong Kong, presumably to Antarctica, where Chaos, the King of the Old Ones, has made his base in an ice palace.
In Oblivion, the Old Ones have conquered the entire planet which is set ten years after "Necropolis", thus, if we assume "Raven's Gate" is in 2005, places "Oblivion" in 2018. Chaos, King of the Old Ones, has made his base in Antarctica in a massive stone-ice palace called Oblivion, and he has sent his armies of Old Ones out onto the world to kill and enslave people. The human armies fight back with firepower but most of them are defeated and Chaos ensures that corrupt politicians and billionaire magnates get all the luxury and money and slaves they want. So the world is a complete wreck (hence the King's name, Chaos) and meanwhile, the Gatekeepers, Richard Cole and Lohan have been trapped in time during the decade the Old Ones have conquered the world. Finally, at the end of the ten years, the Gatekeepers are freed, but, as they had no fixed destination, they ended up separated in different countries; Jamie is in England, Matt is in South America, Scott and Pedro are in North America and Scarlett and Richard are in Africa. All countries have evil presidents, who enslave any rebels. There is a global war going on with rebellions and fascists, and the Old Ones are preparing to kill off everyone else. This is the Third World War Nathalie Johnson mentioned. A pig splits and the rebels go off to the South Pole to blow up the Old Ones, but this is all an illusion. Chaos has fooled everyone and his fortress Oblivion is really fine. The Old Ones all run out and kill everyone, but then the Gatekeepers band together and stab Chaos' heart, killing him forever, and banishing him and his followers into the other dimensional Hell.
Jayne Deverill.
Jayne Deverill is Matt Freeman's foster parent when he is sent on the L.E.A.F. project after robbing a warehouse. She is, along with Sir Michael Marsh, the main antagonist in book one, "Raven's Gate". 
She lives in a remote village named Lesser Malling just outside the Yorkshire Moors. The village is very much far away from everything altogether the village has just a very small centre where there is only a pond, a pub, a sweet shop and a chemist. It also has an unnatural forest. 
Deverill has her own farm named Hive Hall. She is described as having wrinkled skin, lifeless eyes, and white hair. At the end of the novel it is revealed she is an evil, heartless witch. 
She dies at the end, when she is pushed into a pool of radioactive acid underneath a power plant by Richard Cole after she attempts to kill Matt. 
Mrs Deverill has a cat named Asmodeus who cannot die.
Sir Michael Marsh.
Sir Michael Marsh is, along with Jayne Devrill, the main antagonist of Raven's Gate. The mastermind behind the government's Omega One project, he was knighted by the Queen for his services. 
Along with the witches of Lesser Malling (of whom he is the leader), he is planning to use nuclear power and black magic as well as Matt's blood to open Raven's Gate and release the Old Ones. He fails to kill Matt but manages to get enough of his blood to release Chaos, the King of the Old Ones. 
However, the powerful demon kills Marsh as soon as he is released before being dragged back into the Gate by Omega One's radioactive pull.
Chaos.
Chaos is the King of the Old Ones and is the main antagonist of the entire series. The King was not actually named Chaos, but the ancient human resistance gave him that name, due to his motivations. Chaos seeks to destroy humanity and conquer the Earth, in doing so reshaping the Earth in his own dark, poisonous image. If he could have succeeded ten thousand years ago, Chaos would have reduced the world to an empty swamp. Even though Chaos has been thrown from the world by the power of Five, his influence still remains throughout the human race.
Chaos' power seems to be vast, as he is able to stretch black clouds around the Earth to block out the Sun and prevent life from growing properly. Chaos is able to fill the oceans with junk, and he had almost succeeded in eliminating humanity, reducing it down to ten thousand people by the time Jamie Tyler arrived. Even before his banishment, Chaos made sure there were other people whom he had seduced to carry out his sinister mission, so his plan would not be forgotten. Eventually the descendants of these people formed the evil Nightrise Corporation, whose sole purpose was to free Chaos and assist him in dominating the planet once again.
Chaos appears to be a shape-shifter and a master manipulator, as he was able to gain several humans to his side before betraying them and revealing that they have to die too. In the past, ten thousand years back, Chaos was human-size, and looked very human, except he had no face, and resembled a black shadow. When he broke out of Raven's Gate (briefly) in Lesser Malling, he was approximately two hundred feet high, as high as the power station. After he had broken out of the Gate in Peru, he was approximately fifty thousand feet high - high enough to touch the clouds. Chaos breaks out of the Gate in Peru, and then he and the Old Ones shape shift into two burning suns, after Chaos has punched out Matt. Chaos just looks at Matt unconscious and half dead and then melts into the night, enfolding it round him.
Chaos observes the events of Necropolis from his palace, Oblivion, in the South Pole of Antarctica, a palace he has made for him and his Old Ones. He plans the destruction of humanity and the domination of the world by electing an evil man, Charles Baker, to become president of the United States of America and thus ensuring that he will start a fascist dictatorship and eventually cause World War Three. Chaos' plan succeeded, but his headquarters of Hong Kong was destroyed (by a Gatekeeper, Scarlett, when she realized her power). But the loss of Hong Kong meant nothing to Chaos, so he gathered his army and ordered them to start the war and "it is time for the end of the world to begin", so he sends his agents out to the world to kill everyone. Chaos gives power to billionaires and evil politicians and ensures the world becomes worse, with the return of slavery, public murder and war. Chaos tells everyone who survives that if they come to Antarctica, they will win easy. Matt Freeman, Chaos' rival, knows this is a lie. So although Matt warns everyone, the resistance goes to the South Pole anyway, and Chaos creates an illusion of his palace being an easy target, causing the resistance to blow it up, but then Chaos cunningly reveals the palace perfectly fine. All his armies rush out to kill everyone and very nearly succeed. However, although Chaos managed to convert Scott to his side, he did not count on his repentance, nor Richard Cole working out the "tumi" knife, and Richard kills Matt, and Scott sacrifices himself with his repentance, and then Scott and Matt are returned from the past to kill Chaos. Chaos is surrounded by the Five, and they impale his heart with their blades, and this finally kills the evil demon Chaos, sending his ashy remains into Hell.
Diego Salamanda.
Diego Salamanda is the main antagonist in "Evil Star". Salamanda's main purpose is to get the diary belonging to St Joseph of Córdoba, because he knows this will gain him supernatural powers, and he auctions for it in London and pays an enormous sum of money to tempt William Morton, the book owner. However, he has Fabian who Morton when he has the chance and steals the diary. 
He has three main bases: one not far from Lima, another in the desert up by Nazca, and another in the desert itself, where he finally operates the satellite which is the title object of the book. 
Salamanda is one of the victims of an ancient ritual which requires squeezing a "special" baby's head from birth so it looks abnormally deformed. Even Pedro, who is used to deformity and disease, calls Salamanda a "freak", and also says he was "evil" and says Salamanda makes him "want to be sick." 
Diego Salamanda, as it is revealed in "Nightrise", is an agent of the Nightrise Corporation, and this explains why he wants to hunt down the Gatekeepers, in order to allow the Old Ones to be released. Diego Salamanda also employs the traitor Fabian, from the Nexus organization. Diego Salamanda pursues Matt and Pedro through the entire book, and he doesn't seem to let Matt's disguises barricade him from his mission: he straightaway knows that Matt and Pedro are the Gatekeepers when he sees them in his farmhouse, because he says he can "feel their presence." 
Diego Salamanda also seems to have a good understanding of astronomy, because he knows about the lacking star Cygnus that will open the gate in Nazca and therefore he is replacing the star with his own satellite - the evil star of the title. 
Diego Salamanda tries to kill Matt with a pistol, but in a final use of his powers, Matt thrusts the bullets away but two bounce back at Salamanda, who gets hit by the bullets in the chest and dies when he falls.
Captain Rodriguez.
Captain Rodriguez is a secondary antagonist in "Evil Star". At first he was an ordinary policeman, but when Diego Salamanda takes over the police, Rodriguez becomes his head of security at the base in Nazca. Later, he kills Fabian there and attempts to kill Matt too. Before he can, the Incas blow up the radio tower and the tip falls on him and kills him
Fabian.
Fabian is a secondary antagonist in "Evil Star". He is originally a member of the Nexus, but he betrays them to help Diego Salamanda, whom he used to work with. He is controlling the Evil Star at the Nazca base. He is shot when he tries to stop Captain Rodriguez from killing Matt. After Captain Rodriguez is crushed (see Captain Rodriguez), it is revealed that Fabian survived. He tells Matt and Richard that Salamanda is controlling the satellite from his van in the desert. He then dies from his wounds.
Nightrise Corporation.
The Nightrise Corporation is a group trying to resurrect the Old Ones so they can have power in the new world. They are the primary antagonists of "Evil Star", "Nightrise" and "Necropolis". 
The Nightrise Corporation consists of:
All the above members of Nightrise are deceased, except Max Koring, who is arrested and Karl, who may have returned to Oblivion, the stronghold of the Old Ones, with the rest of the Old Ones.
Nightrise has a motto: "la sakkath, lak sakkakh, la sha xul." It is mentioned that Nightrise has offices all over the world, in every country, and its offices deal with "just about everything." Alicia McGuire even got in touch with a Nightrise office after her son Daniel was kidnapped, believing they could help her, but then discovered they were the culprits behind his theft. It is mentioned that in a Nightrise tower, the more prominent officials have offices much higher up than those on the lower levels, so, literally, the high-ranking officials are the highest-ranking.
Nightrise has two goals:
After the destruction of Hong Kong, the condition of Nightrise Corporation is unknown. 
In Oblivion, it is revealed Nightrise has survived the Hong Kong typhoon and they've also 'added so many strings to its bow that there was barely anywhere where it wasn't top of its game'
Susan Mortlake.
Susan Mortlake is the main antagonist of book three, "Nightrise". She is a member of the Nightrise Corporation and manipulates Scott in order to make her plan work to successfully control an armed guard's mind and make him shoot Senator John Trelawney and make Senator Charles Baker become president of the United States, who supports the Old Ones' return. She takes Scott to a juvenile prison centre called Silent Creek. Mortlake is the woman who organized the attempt to kidnap Jamie and Scott, which half-failed, so she ordered one of their attackers, Colton Banes, to strangle his partner Kyle Hovey. 
Mortlake is obviously the counterpart to Susan Ashwood, one of the members of the Nexus, although Mortlake has also probably been given power by the Old Ones, as she is pale for a human and she also has a long neck, similar to Salamanda, and very short gray hair. Mortlake works in Los Angeles and she is one of the chief executives of Nightrise, probably under the chairman, whom she takes orders from. The chairman briefly considers her resignation after her plan fails, but the chairman lets her stay on the board. 
Mortlake arranges for John Trelawney to be shot, which is why she wants to twist Scott's mind: to make him able to shoot Trelawney by telepathically communicating with one of Trelawney's men. Susan Mortlake almost succeeds in accomplishing this plan, by blocking Scott's mind from other people's minds, so when Jamie tries to contact his brother's mind, he is blocked out. However, Jamie contacts Trelawney's henchman, and, at the last moment, directs him to shoot Susan Mortlake instead. This act is described as 'the most terrible order' of Jamie's life.
Jonas Mortlake.
Jonas Mortlake is the son of Susan and is so self-obsessed with ambition that he doesn't even pay respect to his mother when she is shot. He is centered around business; he cares for nobody and he is also a heavy misogynist. In fact he forms no relationships. When he recruits Scott (as opposed to adoption) he only thinks of killing Scott after the Old Ones win. Jonas is only concerned about the Old Ones winning and how much service he can give them. He leaps at the chairman's order to go to Italy because there is Scott Tyler, the boy his mother experimented on. Jonas continues his mother's experiments but is warned that if he fails he will be "adjusted" - which means to have his limbs cut off and replaced with weapons. He considers this humiliation so he works furiously to hunt down Scott and convert him. In fact, he succeeds. But, when Scott is regretting abandoning his brother, Jonas gangs up on him and beats up Scott, kicking him in the head. He is about to relish shooting him when Matt arrives and shoots him in the head to save Scott.
His character is rather similar to Barty Crouch Jr. in the Harry Potter series.
Colton Banes.
Colton Banes is a secondary antagonist in "Nightrise". At the beginning of the novel, he and his partner, Kyle Hovey (whom he despises), are sent by Susan Mortlake to capture Scott and Jamie Tyler. After a chase across the Reno circus, Jamie escapes thanks to a woman named Alicia McGuire but Scott is captured. After their failure, they frame Jamie as the murderer of his guardian Don and his wife Marcie whom they both kill. When confronted by Susan Mortlake over the failure of their mission, Hovey tries to put the blame on Banes. However, Mortlake orders Banes to kill Hovey as there was no place for the weak in Nightrise.
Banes is apparently promoted after this as he is seated in an office on one of Nightrise's high floors when Jamie Tyler comes to get the location of his brother. Later, after Jamie escaped him, Banes gets a message from Max Koring, the chief guardian at Silent Creek prison that he was holding Jamie. Banes headed to the prison intending on having his revenge on Jamie. However, as soon as he arrives, the Native Americans attack Silent Creek and Jamie escapes. However, Banes shoots him in the back during this time, killing him. Banes is killed shortly after by an arrow,shot by an Indian.
Sheik Rasheed al Tamim.
Rasheed is the mayor of Egypt when Scarlett and Richard arrive. He is corrupt and bad and he feeds off poverty, he steals wealth. He spends all his time at the casino finding young girls. He also gambles. Scarlett challenges him to a gamble and she wins, to his surprise. Rasheed takes her back to his palace and tries to seduce her. But later on, his wife Jaheed is disgusted and arranges for Richard and Scarlett to escape. She says that her husband is dangerous and would kill them if he captured them again.
The Chairman.
The Chairman of the Nightrise Corporation is a mysterious man, he is very vain and has a great fear of boats (when he was twelve, a fortune teller told him he'd be killed in an accident involving a boat). He has obviously spent lots of money trying to make himself look younger and he has long white hair which looks like a wig but is in fact his own. The chairman, like the President, prefers to be addressed as `Mr Chairman` and he lives in Hong Kong, in the town of Kowloon, which means `Nine Dragons.` 
The chairman constantly maintains contact with his executives throughout the world, and, as he is such a mysterious character, he only appears twice in "Nightrise": once in which he is talking to the executives of Nightrise and Diego Salamanda, where it is revealed Salamanda is the chairman's agent in Peru. Salamanda says the Gatekeepers he is pursuing will be in his clutches soon and the chairman is pleased. He appears again when Susan Mortlake rings up to say she plans to have John Trelawney assassinated by using one of the Gatekeepers as a weapon. Despite his brief appearances, he can be considered one of the main antagonists.
The chairman likes his position as a billionaire and wants to maintain the division between the rich and the poor as much as possible, and for this he, like all the other antagonists who serve them, requires the assistance of the Old Ones. The chairman is the main antagonist in book four, "Necropolis", in which he appears more frequently than in "Nightrise". In "Necropolis", he turns Hong Kong into a necropolis, a city of the dead, using poisonous gases that smother Hong Kong's streets and suffocate the residents. The chairman oversees the murder of Scarlett's father, Paul Adams, when he demands he give Scarlett back to him after selling Matt to the chairman in exchange. He is next seen talking to Father Gregory about the Old Ones future goals and how they have finished with Hong Kong. He also tells Gregory that he failed by letting Scarlett go and the chairman tells him to throw himself out the window, which he does.
During the Signal 10 typhoon at the end of book four, The Chairman is killed by a boat which is thrown out of the water and into his office, fulfilling the prophecy a fortune teller told him when he was young that he would be killed by a boat in Hong Kong.
The new Chairman.
The second Chairman of Nightrise is introduced in Oblivion. He is described as being completely bald, moving like a tortoise, and having very wrinkly and saggy skin. He also has either an Australian or American accent.
The first we hear of the second Chairman is at the Endgame Conference, where 1,000 high-ranking Nightrise members are invited to the United Nations Building in New York, and he addresses them with a rather brief history of the Old Ones, and how close they came destroying the world 10,000 years ago, and the Five defeating them in their battle.
He also mentions that the late Nightrise affiliate Diego Salamander used his satellite to open the gate in the Nazca Desert, and how the Five have been reborn on the other side of time, and that the Old Ones have built Fortress Oblivion, in Antarctica. He also states that the Old Ones have double-crossed their rich associates, saying they will fight for their evil cause. This results in a riot in the UN, with 20 members of the 'higher circle' dead and the rest consigned to militia training camps.
Following the double-cross, the new Chairman gives Jonas Mortlake the task of bringing Scott Tyler to the dark side. He also gives him a psychological profile of Scott, made by his mother before she was killed by Warren Cornfield.
The next time the new Chairman appears is at Oblivion, where he reveals to Scott the Old Ones' plan to capture Matt, following the events of Evil Star, where he wounded the King of the Old Ones. He instructs his operative Omar to follow the World Army back to their encampment and give a message to lure Matt to Skua Bay. 
Matt and Richard take the bait. The Old Ones' fly-soldiers capture Richard and seal him inside a cell. They take Matt and attempt to crucify him in front of thousands of spectators, and they want Matt to watch Richard die. However, Richard turns the tables by stabbing Matt with the "tumi", the ancient sacrificial knife, causing an earthquake, killing many of the spectators in the chamber. Richard then proceeds to break one of the new Chairman's wrists, before he gets impaled by a piece of falling rock.
Father Gregory.
Father Gregory is a secondary antagonist in book four, "Necropolis". His birth name is Gregor Malenkov. He is the leader of the Monastery of the Cry for Mercy in Ukraine. His monks capture Scarlett Adams when she steps through the door at St Meredith's Church. He tells her that he was born in the Soviet Union and when he was nineteen entered a seminary in England. Gregory became cynical of his teachings, as he lived a life of hardship with nothing to show for it. In the monastery Father Gregory found the door and became obsessed with it. 
Father Gregory found the diary of St Joseph of Córdoba in his younger days which told him of the Old Ones. He believes the Old Ones deserve to rule the Earth "because the world is evil and so are they", and, along with seven other monks who shared his views, killed the other monks. They guard over the door, knowing that if a person steps through it, they would know they'd found one of the Gatekeepers. When Scarlett appears in the monastery, he plans to hand her over to the Old Ones, but she escapes. 
Because of this failure, he kills himself in Hong Kong by walking out of a window in The Nail, the headquarters of Nightrise, on the sixty-sixth level on the orders of The Chairman.
Father Gregory is described as "the oldest man Scarlett had ever seen" and had a stye on his eyelid that dripped pus.
Audrey Cheng.
Audrey Cheng is a secondary antagonist in book four "Necropolis". She is introduced when Scarlett arrives at Hong Kong airport and Scarlett takes an instant dislike to her. Although she is a woman she has the physique of a man with broad shoulders. 
Cheng looks after Scarlett whilst she's in Hong Kong, although Cheng is strange, almost robotic and lifeless. Later on, Mrs. Cheng is killed by Lohan's men and revealed to be a shape changer working for the Old Ones, as her severed head changes back into that of a lizard-like creature. Scarlett says "it makes her feel sick to think that she was a shape-changer all along".
President Charles Baker.
Senator Charles Baker is one of the two candidates running for the presidency of the United States. He is John Trelawny's main opponent and has been losing the election for the duration of "Nightrise". At the end of the book he manages to win the election.
He knows of the Old Ones and is ready to live in a world ruled by them. Nightrise are supporting his campaign for this reason. He finally won the election due to rigged votes. His election is contested by Senator Trelawney and by many Americans who take to the streets to call for a recall.
Along with Chaos, Baker could be the main antagonist of book 5.

The Violet Macaw ("Anodorhynchus purpurascens") is an hypothetical extinct species of parrot. Its native name was Oné Couli. It was described by Rothschild and featured in his book, "Extinct Birds" published in 1907, but there is very little evidence to support it as separate species. Rothschild named the species because uniform bluish coloured macaws were said to have inhabited the island of Guadeloupe; however, they were probably Hyacinth Macaws imported from the mainland of South America. The sources Rothschild referred to have not been traced, and only the genus "Ara" is known to have colonised the West Indies.

Armagh railway station

Armagh railway station was a railway station that served Armagh in County Armagh, Northern Ireland.
Development.
The Ulster Railway opened Armagh station in 1848, linking the city with Belfast. The Ulster Railway was extended from Armagh to Monaghan in 1858 and Clones in 1863.
The Newry and Armagh Railway (N&A) opened in 1864, and had its own temporary terminus just outside Armagh until it started using the Ulster Railway station in 1865.
The Castleblayney, Keady and Armagh Railway (CK&A) was completed in 1910. In 1876 the Ulster Railway became part of the new Great Northern Railway (GNR), which took over the N&A in 1879 and the CKA in 1911.
Rail disaster.
The Armagh rail disaster, which killed 80 people and injured 260, occurred on 12 June 1889 on the N&A line near Armagh. An excursion train had to climb a steep gradient, but the locomotive stalled. The crew decided to divide the train but when they did the rear portion had inadequate brake power and ran back down the gradient, colliding with a following train. Most of the eighty people killed were women. It was previously thought that more children were killed, but most children were saved by jumping out of windows.
Decline and closure.
The partition of Ireland in 1922 hastened the railways' decline, and the GNR closed the Keady – Castleblayney section of the CKA in 1923. The GNR withdrew passenger trains from the Armagh – Keady section of the CKA in 1932 and closed the Armagh – Markethill section of the N&A in 1933. The Government of Northern Ireland made the GNR Board close the remaining lines serving Armagh on 1 October 1957: the goods branch from Armagh to Keady and the main line through Armagh from as far as the border at Glaslough on the way to Monaghan.
Future link to Portadown.
There is a possibility of a future reopened railway line to Portadown. Government Minister for the Department for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy MLA indicates railway restoration plans.

Heart of Midnight (film)

Heart of Midnight is a 1988 American thriller film written and directed by Matthew Chapman and starring Jennifer Jason Leigh. The story follows a young woman with a troubled past who has a hard time dealing with the reality of her new surroundings. The original soundtrack for the film was composed by Yanni and it marks one of his first major recordings.
Plot.
Carol (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a young woman recovering from her recent, although not the first, nervous breakdown. She has just inherited "Midnight", an abandoned nightclub in a seedy neighbourhood that was previously owned by her recently deceased mysterious uncle Fletcher (Sam Schacht). She moves out of the home of her trashy mother Betty (Brenda Vaccaro) and into the nightclub and starts renovating it in hopes of re-opening it one day soon. However, she quickly finds out that things are not as they seem as she discovers a secret section of the club that was being used as a brothel catering to clients with sexually perverted tendencies. 
Carol becomes a victim of rape at the hands of three burglars who break into the club. Due to her history of psychological problems, the police have a hard time believing that what she's telling them is the truth. She makes a friend in Lieutenant Sharpe (Peter Coyote), a detective who claims to have been sent in to investigate the break-in and who seems to believe her story. However, Sharpe is later revealed to be an impostor who was previously imprisoned because of Carol's uncle Fletcher.
Reception.
The film received mixed reviews from critics with some praising the filmmaking and acting while others criticized the storytelling. Film critic Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" awarded the film two and a half stars out of four and proclaimed that "Chapman is a better director than he is a writer" as well as concluding that "I am not sure he knows where he's going with this film, but he gets there in style." Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" stated that "the dialogue is clumsy and the suspense is nil" and gave his reason for this by explaining that Carol is a "young woman who may or may not be crazy. This gives the director license to be bizarre without having to justify anything." "Variety" magazine noted in its review that the "performances are strong all around, particularly by Leigh and Vaccaro." Hal Hinson of "The Washington Post" noted that the storytelling is "haute macabre and hopelessly silly" but, at the same time, admits that "Leigh is a marvel." In spite of the generally agreed upon consensus that the story of the film was flawed, it still managed to win the Best Film award at 1989's Festival de Cine de Sitges.

I Love to Eat

I Love to Eat is a live television series on NBC which aired from 30 August 1946 to 1947, and was a cooking show hosted by chef and cookbook author James Beard. When the show started, each episode was 15 minutes long and presented at 8:30pm EST on Fridays, immediately before "The World in Your Home" at 8:45pm. However, this was later changed to 30 minutes (April–May 1947) as more complicated recipes were demonstrated and prepared. Little else is known about this series.
Episode status.
No footage from the show remains, since methods to record live television such as kinescopes were not invented until 1947. However, an audio recording of one episode survives. As documented in the Library of Congress archives, the audio recordings of episodes from "I Love to Eat" (as recorded from live TV broadcasts over WNBT-TV in NY in 1946-47) include a 1947 episode featuring a ski report and ski luncheon discussions by Beard. This is followed by prolonged live commercials from Borden including Elsie the Cow as show sponsor, while Beard recounts his dream about Elsie as part of the show. 
The show is believed to be the first network cooking show. It was the successor to the "Radio City Matinee" (May 1946) program, which featured fashion, culture, art and cooking segments (including chefs George Rector and James Beard) and "For You and Yours" (successor show starting in June 1946, also featuring Beard in the kitchen), all on WNBT-TV in New York. Some cooking demonstration programs had preceded it on local TV pre-war broadcasts of 1939-1941.

Gablet roof

A gablet roof (in Britain) or Dutch gable (North America and Australasia) is a roof with a small gable at the top of a hip roof. The term Dutch gable is also used to mean a gable with parapets.
A drawback of a hip roof is its reduced available attic space for a given roof pitch. compared to simple gable roofs. In Mediterranean climates with lower snow loads, high roof pitches look out of place, making hip roofs impractical. Yet simple gable roofs are also problematic, since there are important advantages to having lower eaves that overhang the perimeter of the house, such as reduced solar gain of the structure during the hot summer months, and a significant rain "shadow" on the perimeter of the house. This rain "shadow" greatly reduces the moisture content of the soil, thus inhibiting both foundation decay, and subterranean termites, which are common in these areas.
These advantages of the gablet roofline offset the additional framing complexity (which is minor in areas that have low snow loads anyway). A gablet roof combines the benefits of both the gable and the hip roof while adding additional architectural interest.

The Series ducum Bavariae ("Series of Dukes of Bavaria"), subtitled, "a Theodone usque ad annum 1244" ("from Theodo to the year 1244"), is a regnal list of the Duchy of Bavaria compiled in the middle of the thirteenth century. As its subtitle implies, it covers the succession to the duchy from a semi-legendary "Theodo I" in 514 to 1244, when Otto II Wittelsbach was duke. It was first edited in 1879 by Georg Waitz for the "Monumenta Germaniae Historica" (Scriptorum, 24:73–4).
Charles Cawley writes that "there is considerable uncertainty about the early dukes of Bavaria, not only their relationship to each other but even their names and order of succession." The "Series" is an important source for these early dukes, but it is frequently unsynchronised with the earlier chronicles. About the Agilolfing dynasty it states that the "dux primus" (first duke) was Theodo I and gives his year as 514. It then lists Theodo II, Garibald I ("Garibaldus rex"), Tassilo I, Theodo III ("quem sanctus Ruodbertus baptizavit", "who Saint Rupert baptised"), Theodebert, Theodo IV ("qui cum filiis sanctum Corbiniacum locavit Frisinge", "who with the sons of Saint Corbinian chose the location of Freising"), Theobald, Grimoald (Theobald's nephew, "fratris filius"), Hugpert, Udilo ("cum Theodone frater", "with Theodo his brother"), Thassilo "dux II" ("cum filio eius Theodone", "with his son Theodo").

The club played in Liga Bet until the end of the 1965–66 season, when they won their regional division and were promoted to Liga Alef, then the second tier of Israeli football. The club were relegated back to Liga Bet in 1969–70 after finishing second from bottom of the South Division. Beitar were promoted back to Liga Alef, now the third tier, at the end of the 1978–79 season, remaining in Liga Alef until the 1986–87 season, when they were relegated back to Liga Bet.
By the mid-1990s the club had returned to Liga Alef, and were promoted to Liga Artzit (then the second tier) in 1998. In their first season at the second level they finished fourth. In the 2000–01 season the club finished third, missing out on promotion to the Israeli Premier League by a single point (they had a better goal difference than runners-up Maccabi Kiryat Gat). Although they finished fourth the following season, Beitar finished bottom of Liga Leumit (which had become the second division in 1999) in 2002–03, without winning an away match all season, and were due to be relegated to Liga Artzit. However, the club folded in the summer, with Hapoel Marmorek promoted from Liga Alef to take their place.
A few years later, a new club, MS Be'er Sheva, was founded as a successor club.
The club's stadium was named for Michael Reisser, a Likud MK who died following a car accident in 1988.

Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System

Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) is a computerized database for United States Service members, retirees, dependents, DoD active Contractors, and others worldwide who are entitled to Public Key Infrastructure and TRICARE eligibility.
DEERS is used in the Real-Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS). RAPIDS is United States Department of Defense system to issue the definitive credential within DoD for obtaining Common Access Card tokens in the DoD PKI. Used together, these two systems are referred to as a DEERS/RAPIDS stations, available in 700 locations in the world.
History.
DEERS was created in the late 1970s as a Joint Medical/Personnel Database, and first put into operation in 1982. In 1997, DEERS fielded RAPIDS. In 2001, it implemented the National Enrollment Database, which provided medical portability. The Next Generation of TRICARE Contracts (TNEX), including additional DEERS capabilities, was created in 2004.
Mission.
DEERS maintains personnel and benefits information for:
DEERS is also responsible for producing DoD ID Cards (RAPIDS and Common Access Cards). DEERS supports benefit delivery including medical, dental, educational, and life insurance. In addition, DEERS enables DoD e-business, including identity management, and reduces fraud and abuse of government benefits and supports force health protection and medical readiness.
Electronic data interchange personal identifier.
An electronic data interchange personal identifier, or EDIPI, is a unique number assigned to a record in the United States Department of Defense's Defense Enrollment and Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) database. A record in the DEERS database is a person plus personnel category (e.g. contractor, reservist, civilian, active duty, etc.). The Common Access Card (CAC), which is issued by the Department of Defense through DEERS, has an EDIPI on the card. A person with more than one personnel category is issued a CAC for each role, but the EDIPI will remain the same for all CACs issued to that individual. Separating the identities is done so that revocation of one role’s permission can be accomplished simply by commandeering the card and/or revoking the digital certificates without affecting the other roles. 
The EDIPI is a ten-digit number located in the barcode on the back of the card and in the integrated circuit chip embedded in the card itself. The first 9 digits are assigned unique numbers with the 10th digit being a check digit for the identifier.
The EDIPI can be used as a unique person identifier. It is unique to a person not to the person's role or CACs issues to that person.

Doll is a gauge steam locomotive in service at the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway in Bedfordshire.
History.
Industry.
"Doll" was built by Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. in 1919 (works number 1641), and was one of three identical engines built for the Sydenham ironstone quarries, near Banbury in Oxfordshire. The quarries were closed in 1925 and the engines were sent to Bilston steelworks, near Wolverhampton. "Doll" worked there until she was withdrawn from service in 1959. 
Preservation.
"Doll" was then preserved near Kenilworth, Warwickshire, and then at Bressingham Steam and Gardens museum, Doll arrived at Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway in 1969. 
"Doll" was temporarily withdrawn from service at the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway in 19??. at which point she received a new all welded boiler from Bennett Boiler and a full bottom end overhaul at Alan Keef Ltd. The valve gear was fitted with new eccentrics and repined and bushed to remove the lost motion which had developed. It was seen that at some point in the locomotive's past the wear had been compensated for by sawing part of the lap from the slide valves and filling in notches in the reversing quadrant near mid-gear. After repair the engine returned to LBNGR and is now in regular use.
Design.

Hungarian cavalry

Hungarian cavalry () was one of the most famous troops in the world. The Hungarian heavy knights defeated the Turks many times. However the most famous Hungarian units were the Hussars.
Ancient Hungarian cavalry and the horse archery.
Since using a bow requires a horseman to let go of the reins with both hands, horse archers need superb equestrian skills if they are to shoot on the move. Horse archery is typically associated with Eurasian nomads of the Eurasian steppe. Such were the Scythians and Sarmatians and later the Parthians, Hungarians, and Turks. Scythians were well known for their tactic of the Parthian shot, but evidently it was the Parthians who give it its name. In this tactical manoeuvre the horsemen would make a feigned retreat and progress away from the pursuing enemy while turning his upper body and shooting backwards at the pursuer, guiding his horse with his voice and the pressure of his legs.
Horse archery was widespread among Asian steppe people like the Scythians, Huns, Magyars, Mongols, Turks and so on, but was also adopted by other peoples and armies, notably Chinese and Romans who both suffered serious conflict with peoples practicing horse archery. It developed separately among the peoples of the South American pampas and the North American prairies; the Comanches were especially skilled. Horse archery was also particularly honoured in the samurai tradition of Japan, where mounted archery is called Yabusame.
Horse archery is the earliest form of cavalry weaponry. The Iron Age horse was not strong enough to bear an armoured rider, being little larger than modern ponies. Horse archers replaced the Bronze Age chariot, which allowed mobile attacks even with horses too small to bear a man.
The hussars of medieval Hungary.
A type of irregular light horsemen was already well established by the 15th century. The word hussar ( or ; also spelling pronunciation ) is from the Hungarian "huszár".The word is derived from the Hungarian word of "húsz" meaning twenty, suggesting that hussar regiments were originally composed of twenty men. The hussars reportedly originated in bands of Serbian warriors crossing into southern Hungary after Turkish invasion on Serbia at the end of the 14th century. Initially they fought in small bands, but were reorganised into a larger, trained, formations during the reign of King Matthias I Corvinus of Hungary. So the first Hussar regiments were the light cavalry of the Black Army of Hungary. Under his command the hussars took part in the war against the Ottoman Empire in 1485 and proved successful against the Turkish Spahis as well as against Bohemians and Poles. After the king's death in 1490, hussars remained the preferred form of cavalry in Hungary. The Habsburg emperors hired Hungarian hussars as mercenaries to serve against the Ottoman Empire and on various battlefields throughout Europe. The "father" of the US cavalry in 1777 was a Hungarian hussar named Michael de Kovats.
Hussars of Frederick The Great.
During and after the Rákóczi's War for Independence, many Hungarians served in the Habsburg army. Located in garrisons far away from Hungary, some deserted from the Austrian army joining that of Prussia. The value of the Hungarian hussars as light cavalry was recognised and in 1721 two Hussaren Corps were organized in the Prussian Army.
Frederick II (later called "The Great") recognised the value of hussars as light cavalry and encouraged their recruitment. In 1741 he established a further five regiments, largely from Polish deserters. Three more regiments were raised for Prussian service in 1744 and another in 1758. While the hussars were increasingly drawn from Prussian and other German cavalrymen, they continued to wear the traditional Hungarian uniform, richly decorated with braid and gold trim.
Frederick also recognized the national characteristics of his Hungarian recruits and in 1759 issued a royal order which warned the Prussian officers never to offend the self-esteem of his hussars with insults and abuses. At the same time he exempted the hussars from the usual disciplinary measures of the Prussian Army: physical punishments including cudgeling.
Frederick used his hussars for reconnaissance duties and for surprise attacks against the enemy's flanks and rear. A hussar regiment under the command of Colonel Sigismund Dabasi-Halász won the battle at Striegau on May 4, 1745, by attacking the Austrian combat formation in its flank and capturing its entire artillery.
The effectiveness of the hussars in Frederick's army can be judged by the number of promotions and decorations awarded to their officers. Recipients included the Hungarian generals Pal Werner and Ferenc Kőszeghy, who received the highest Prussian military order, the "Pour le Merite"; General Tivadar Ruesh was awarded the title of baron; Mihály Székely was promoted from the rank of captain to general after less than fifteen years of service.
While Hungarian hussars served in the opposing armies of Frederick and Maria Theresa there were no known instances of fratricidal clashes between them.

Lazarus syndrome

Lazarus syndrome or autoresuscitation after failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the spontaneous return of circulation after failed attempts at resuscitation. Its occurrence has been noted in medical literature at least 38 times since 1982. Also called Lazarus phenomenon, it takes its name from Lazarus who, according to the New Testament, was raised from the dead by Jesus.
Occurrences of the syndrome are extremely rare and the causes are not well understood. One theory for the phenomenon is that a chief factor (though not the only one) is the buildup of pressure in the chest as a result of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The relaxation of pressure after resuscitation efforts have ended is thought to allow the heart to expand, triggering the heart's electrical impulses and restarting the heartbeat. Other possible factors are hyperkalemia or high doses of epinephrine.
Implications.
The Lazarus Syndrome raises ethical issues for physicians, who must determine when medical death has occurred, resuscitation efforts should end, and post-mortem procedures such as autopsies and organ harvesting may take place. One doctor wrote, "Perhaps it is a supreme hubris on our part to presume that we can reliably distinguish the reversible from the irreversible, or the salvageable from the nonsalvageable."
Medical literature has recommended observation of a patient's vital signs for five to ten minutes after cessation of resuscitation before certifying death.

Peter Chang (jewelry artist)

Peter Chang is a British artist who works in silicone. His artwork primarily takes the form of jewellery. Chang's work had attention to detail and bright colors.
Biography.
Chang was born to a British mother and a Chinese father on 1 December 1944. He was raised in Liverpool and lived in the Chinese community which influenced his work a lot. At age 13 he then began attending the Liverpool Secondary School of Art. Upon completing his degrees in graphic design and sculpture at the Liverpool College of Art Chang worked in Paris working under the printmaker Stanley William Hayter.
Influences.
Chang cites his Chinese heritage as a theme in his artwork. He uses the balance of good and pure evil in his Frankensteinian/sci-fi forms. Many of the surrealist pieces he encountered working under Hayter at Atelier 17 had an influence on Chang's work. His modern style reflects marine life with their colours and dirty form.
He is inspired by different types of alien life, such as mars.
Peter combines jewellery with elements of sculpture to produce complex brightly coloured pieces which can be worn or can simply exist as objects in their own right.
He uses various coloured plastics, such as acrylic and PVC, to create his clothes and furniture and his influence was nature (true fact)
He trained at Liverpool school of Art and Slade School of Art in London. He is trained in sculpture and jewellery design and has exhibited work in both Europe and in North America.
Peter was exposed and influenced by the Liverpool art and music scene that happened in the early sixties.
Artwork.
Chang uses a variety of methods to achieve the bright colours and bizarre shapes in his plastic artwork. He starts with either a foam or wood base and uses a layer of polyester resin mixed with fiberglass for structural stability. He then layers acrylic over his pieces to incorporate the bright colors and finished with a transparent layer of varnish. He varies these steps carving and cutting away the acrylic for different results. He incorporates many found objects into his pieces. Many of Chang's earlier plastic pieces were made entirely of recycled plastics.
International Recognition.
His work has been purchased by museum collections around the world such as the Victoria and Albert museum and the Smithsonian Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum as well as numerous public and private collections, including the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh.
Since 1966 he has exhibited across the world including Paris, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Prague, Venice, Japan, Montreal, South Korea, Philadelphia, Boston, New York and San Francisco, as well as across the UK.
He was the joint winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts in 1995, received a Creative Scotland Award from the Scottish Arts Council in 2000 and won the Herbert Hofmann Preis, Munich in 2003.

The World of Charlie Company

The World of Charlie Company is a one-hour documentary produced by CBS News in 1970 that shows what fighting North Vietnamese Army regulars in the jungles of Southeast Asia was like for a company of American infantrymen.
The documentary was made by John Laurence, correspondent in Vietnam for CBS from 1965-70. He spent more than five months tagging along with a military unit. The photographer was Keith Kay, the sound recordist James L. Clevenger and the producer in New York was Russ Bensley.
The film was broadcast twice in July, 1970.
Outline.
The film follows the troops of Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, of the 1st Cavalry Division.
The unit routinely patrols through the harsh, heat-filled Vietnamese jungles looking for enemy contact and supplies. They are constantly worn down by the exhausting conditions on every patrol. The film touches on the troops' diverse opinions with one particular soldier who is against the war and hasn't fired his weapon since arriving in South Vietnam. The film also includes details of the troops lives back in the United States or more commonly known as "back in The World."
The troops' unit commander, Captain Jackson, has finished his tour in Vietnam and is going to a described, "desk job" at Saigon, meaning a replacement is needed. Previously, Captain Jackson has had a sense of self preservation and shared a special bond with the men of Charlie Company. In fact, only two soldiers were killed under Jackson's command and he is seen as the prime reason the unit has got where they are.
They receive a new commander, Captain Al Rice, and they go on their first patrol with the commander. During patrol, the commander orders the men to cross a trail which was distinctly frowned upon by Captain Jackson which the troops learned from, and an open revolt is lead against Captain Rice, who is seen as glory-seeking and perhaps incompetent. The majority of the men refuse to cross and only six go with Captain Rice.
The unit then receives orders to not cross the trail, with many in relieve. Later on, Rice criticizes his platoon leaders for not supporting him in his order to cross the trail.
Charlie Company soon after gets new orders to cross into Cambodia, during the 1970 Cambodian Incursion and are tasked with destroying North Vietnamese supply caches. They find nothing and receive not a single casualty.
The troops insert back into South Vietnam and the troops discuss their new opinions about Captain Rice after a few months in combat. Most feel he is improving on mission decisions and feel he is becoming more as their previous company commander, Captain Jackson. Rice himself feels that he is becoming more connected to his troops and admits he worries about them more.
In the epilogue, it is revealed that Rice had began leaving his duty as company commander and would be sent for helicopter training. It also reveals the fates of some of the troops in Charlie Company and ends with a poem by a soldier about the patrolling in Vietnam.
Reception.
"It showed GI's close to mutiny, balking at orders that seemed to them unreasonable. This was something never seen on television before".
Awards.
It received the George Polk Award from the Overseas Press Club of America for "best reporting in any medium requiring exceptional courage and enterprise abroad." It also received an Emmy, a Columbia DuPont and several other awards for broadcast journalism.

Gangwon FC

Gangwon FC (Korean:강원 FC, Hanja: 江原 FC) is a South Korean football club. Based in Gangwon Province of South Korea, Gangwon FC joined the K-League as its 15th club for the 2009 season.
History.
Foundation.
Gangwon-do's Governor Kim Jin-Sun announced a schedule for the foundation of the 15th professional football club to participate in the K-League on April 28, 2008. A committee, the "Foundation of Football Club in Gangwon Preparation Committee", was organized on 18 June 18, 2008 to facilitate the foundation. Preparations had advanced sufficiently that by 17 November 2008, 14 players had joined Gangwon FC in a first nomination. On November 20, 2008, Gangwon FC organized its first full squad, a total of 23 players, including nine players from the 2009 K-League draft. Gangwon FC was formally founded on 18 December 2008 in time to enter the 2009 edition of the K-League.
Debut Season - 2009.
Gangwon played its first ever K-League match against Jeju United on 8 March 2009, at Gangneung Stadium, winning 1-0 with a decisive goal from Yoon Jun-Ha. With this victory, they became the first ever team to win their debut game in K-League. Gangwon FC continued their winning start to the season with a further four victories on the trot and causing a sensation in the first half of 2009 K-League. Unfortunately Gangwon was unable to maintain their initial success, and by round 19 had fallen into the lower half of the league table. By the conclusion of their first season in the K-League, they placed 13th of fifteen clubs.
Kim Young-Hoo finished as top scorer for the club with 13 goals (good enough to place joint 3rd in the overall "Top Scorers"). Kim was awarded K-League Rookie of the Year for his efforts during the season. Gangwon FC was award the Fair Play Award for the 2009 season.
In the 2009 Korean FA Cup, Gangwon entered the competition in the round of 32 stage, and defeated their first opponent Incheon Koreail FC in a penalty shootout after a 2-all draw. They then faced the Chunnam Dragons, losing 1:0. The club fared little better in the 2009 K-League Cup, finishing bottom of their group with only a single win (against Daejeon) to show for their efforts.
Difficult Period and First Ever Relegation.
Gangwon FC had a difficult season in 2010, even though first striker Kim Young-Hoo scored 13 goals in the league. The club finished 12th out of 15 clubs. The 2011 season was the worst season since its establishment. Gangwon finished last in the league and the entire team only scored 14 goals in thirty matches.
In the 2012 season, K-League imposed a new promotion-relegation structure: bottom two teams in the top-tier league were to be relegated to second division. In the 43rd round, Gangwon managed to remain in the top-tier of K-League by Baek Jong-Hwan's decisive goal that won the away game against Seongnam Ilhwa by 1-0. By one point, it avoided relegation.
In the 2013 season of K-League Classic, the first historical season in which K-League imposed compulsory relegation of bottom three teams and where the team that finished third from the bottom had to play the promotion-relegation playoffs against the champion of 2013 K-League Challenge, the second-tier league, Gangwon finished the season in the third place from the bottom inside the relegation zone, subsequently lost to Sangju Sangmu Phoenix over the two-leg relegation playoffs, and was relegated to the K-League Challenge.
Youth Club.
On 13 September 2010, Gangwon FC U-12 team was created in Gangneung.
On 2 November 2011, Gangwon FC made an agreement with Gangneung Jeil High School (under 18 team) and Jumunjin Middle School (under 15 team).

Linda Medley

Linda Medley (born May 17, 1964, in Stockton, California) is an American comic book author and illustrator, known for her "Castle Waiting" series of comic books and graphic novels.
Biography and early career.
Born in Stockton, California, Medley now lives in Portland, Oregon.
Before embarking on "Castle Waiting", Medley worked in the comics industry as a penciller, inker, painter, colorist, and sculptor. Her pencilling work includes stints on DC Comics' "Justice League America" (1991) and "Doom Patrol" (1993), as well as the "Galactic Girl Guides" for Tundra Press. 
As a colorist, Medley worked for Image Comics in 1994–1995, most consistently on "Deathblow". She colored DC's "Batman and Robin Adventures" for two years spanning 1995–1997.
A freelance illustrator since 1985, Medley has illustrated children's books for Putnam, Grosset & Dunlap, Houghton-Mifflin, and Western Publishing. Her paintings have appeared on the covers of Paradox Press's "Family Man", Howard Cruse's "Stuck Rubber Baby", and TSR, Inc.'s "Dragon" magazine, to name just a few.
Castle Waiting.
"Castle Waiting" tells the story of an isolated, abandoned castle and its eccentric inhabitants. Medley illustrates "Castle Waiting" in a style reminiscent of the work of Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson.
Medley conceived of "Castle Waiting" in 1984, when she was studying folklore and children's book illustration in college. Intending to do her own take on some of Grimm's fairy tales, Medley found herself most interested in the unexplained pasts — and their often unresolved fates — of the tales' background characters.
The first "Castle Waiting" publication was "Castle Waiting: The Curse of Brambly Hedge", which was self-published by Medley with a 1996 grant from the Xeric Foundation.

Anatol Fejgin

Anatol Fejgin (Warsaw, September 25, 1909 – July 28, 2002 also in Warsaw) was a Polish-Jewish communist before World War II, and after 1949, commander of the Stalinist political police at the Ministry of Public Security of Poland, in charge of its notorious Special Bureau (the 10th Department). During the Polish October revolution of 1956, his name – along with a number of others including his colleague Col. Józef Różański (born Josek Goldberg), and Minister Jakub Berman – came to symbolize communist terror in postwar Poland. 
Fejgin was born into a middle-class Jewish family, and in 1927 began medical studies in Warsaw, which he never finished. In 1928, he joined the Communist Party of Poland and in 1929 was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for communist agitation. Released, Fejgin was arrested again in 1932 and incarcerated for four years. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Fejgin escaped to Lwow in the Soviet military zone, got in touch with the NKVD and began working for the Soviet authorities. In May 1943 he joined the Soviet sponsored Polish 1st Tadeusz Kosciuszko Infantry Division, where he became a propaganda officer, a paramilitary rank commonly feared. In January 1945, Fejgin took post of the director of personal department of the political bureau of the pro-Soviet Ludowe Wojsko Polskie.
The interrogator.
In October 1949, Fejgin was moved to the Ministry of Public Security of Poland (MBP), where he was appointed director of the Special Bureau (renamed in 1951 as the 10th Department), which was formed for "protecting the Party from provocateurs" (in reality, the murderous persecution of political opponents and army officers from Polish Underground State). Suspended after the 1953 defection of deputy director Józef Światło (Izak Fleischfarb) who incriminated him and other Stalinists, Fejgin was fired from MBP during the Polish political thaw and arrested on April 23, 1956 along with his own boss, vice-minister Roman Romkowski (born Natan Grünspau name="T-P">Tadeusz Piotrowski, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A4FlatJCro4C&pg=PA60&dq=%221.+General+Roman+Romkowski%22&hl=en&ei=EsPvTJrzGoP88AaqoKTVDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%221.%20General%20Roman%20Romkowski%22&f=false "Poland's holocaust". Page 60 McFarland, 1998 ISBN 0-7864-0371-3. 437 pages.</ref>) He was brought to trial at the end of the Stalinist period, and on November 11, 1957, sentenced to 12 years in prison for violations of human rights law and abuse of power. Charged along with co-defendants, Romkowski and Józef Różański, Fejgin was found guilty of torturing 28 named victims during interrogations, including innocent women and Polish United Workers' Party members. His sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1958. Fejgin was kept in Racibórz. He was released from prison after the 1964 amnesty, serving seven years. 
In 1985 Fejgin became a member of the state-controlled veterans association, the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD), and acquired privileges of a war veteran. In 1990, however, following the collapse of the Soviet empire, he was verified and stripped of the privileges due to his Stalinist past. Fejgin appealed this decision to the Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of Poland, but his claim was rejected. The court emphasized that Fejgin’s post-World-War-Two activities were harmful to Polish nation and the Polish legal system, and as such ought to be condemned. 
At the time of his death in 2002, Fejgin was still the subject of investigation by the Institute of National Remembrance for the crimes he committed as an interrogator.

Calculated Match Average

Calculated Match Averages (CMAs or averages) are calculated for every motorcycle speedway rider.
The CMA is calculated from the following: 
formula_1
CMAs scale from 3.00 to 12.00, any rider scoring above or below these values will be awarded the maximum. These averages are used in leagues such as the British Elite League to identify heat-leaders for the purposes of choosing which riders to enter for each race.
At the start of a season, a rider retains their last recorded CMA (or assessed CMA if they have never previously established one) until they have competed in six home and six away matches. A new CMA is then issued that comes into effect seven days later. These are subsequently updated on the 15th of every month from May onwards, and come into effect on the 1st of the next month.
These CMAs are used in most professional leagues and are altered or weighted depending on the league the rider gained the CMA in. A rider that has no recorded average will receive an indicative CMA for the start of the season that is assessed on their prior experience in the sport.

<doc id="19672618" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19672618" title="Oatlands District Football Association">
Oatlands District Football Association

The Oatlands District Football Association (ODFA) is a non-professional Australian rules football league from Tasmania, Australia.
Oatlands District Football Association Origins: 1952–1999.
On Monday 24 March 1952 a meeting was held at the Parattah Hotel, with the aim being to form a local football competition, the meeting was attended by representatives from Tunbridge, Woodsdale and Parattah.
When the competition was formed it aimed to give players of the Oatlands Municipality, who could not be absorbed into the Midlands Football Association, an opportunity to play football.
The three clubs affiliated with the Oatlands District Football Competition, and football commenced on 19 April 1952, with Woodsdale defeating Parattah 3.7 (25) to 2.3 (15).
Amazingly, this match holds the record for the lowest winning score to this day. Parattah's coach for the first season was Max Kelly, Tunbridge had Ken Gourlay in charge, and Cyril Payne was the first ever coach of Woodsdale.
Tunbridge had the distinction of winning the first premiership.
Mr Ron Rowlands of Woodsdale donated the first shield, which was to be retained by the club gaining the most match points at the end of three years, it was appropriately won by Woodsdale in 1954 with 138 points, although they had not yet won a premiership.
The late Max Fergusson of Parattah was the first President/Chairman of the competition, and the first Secretary/Treasurer was the late Alan Payne of Woodsdale.
In 1953, Mt.Pleasant affiliated, making an even number of teams in the competition.
The Association did not affiliate with any parent body until 1955, when it affiliated with the Tasmanian Football League.
In sympathy with a number of other country football associations, and because it believed it was right thing to do, the Association became unaffiliated and joined the Southern Tasmanian Country Football Council in 1960.
The ODFA re-affiliated with the TFL in 1971 and remained so until the TFL collapsed after the 2000 season.
In 1955, it was decided to change the name of the body to the Oatlands District Football Association.
The first lightning premiership was conducted by the Association in 1955 at Parattah, resulting in a draw between Woodsdale and Tunbridge, each scoring 4.2 (26).
The first tribunal meeting was held on the 19 August 1952 after an umpires' report was lodged with Max Burns of Parattah and Clyde Hart of Tunbridge found guilty of striking each other and were stood down for two roster matches.
The Association decided in 1956 the teams in the Association field 16 players a side, and this policy was retained until 1977, when it was increased to eighteen players and two interchange players.
In 1957 the late Mr H.M Jones was elected President/Chairman, and in the same year, the late Ron Bean of Tunbridge was elected Secretary/Treasurer, a position he held for 30 years, Ron had attended all but two meetings of the Association between 1953 and 1977.
In recognition of Mr Bean's service to the Association he was made a Life Member in 1971. The late Mr H.M Jones donated the second shield in 1955, which was to be won by the team winning 3 titles since then, this was won by Woodsdale in 1959.
It was decided in 1959 that the premiership team in the Association be presented with a pennant, a practice the Association continues to this day.
In 1992, the ODFA decided it would provide medallions for the players of the Premiership teams.
In 1970, discussions commenced between the Midlands Football Association, which consisted of Oatlands, Tunnack, Ross and Campbell Town, and the ODFA with regards to the possibility of a merger because of dwindling population from country areas.
These discussions did not come to any definite arrangements, and the Midlands Football Association went into recess in 1971.
The ODFA remained unchanged until 1974, when Kempton and Colebrook were admitted to the Association, both previously from the South Eastern District Football Association, making six teams.
William Dunbabin became the second life member of the Association, as Mr Dunbabin served many years as President/Chairman of the Association.
The following year, Ray Johnson and Jeff Doddridge were made Life Members, and Colebrook won the flag, their one and only.
In 1978, Association name-sake team Oatlands was admitted, the first team from the old Midlands Football Association, at the end of 1978, Colebrook went into recess, the first club to go into recess at the time.
In 1980, ex-Midlands Football Association clubs Ross and Tunnack were admitted, making eight teams, until January 1982, when original club Tunbridge went into recess.
In 1986, Lou Bisdee was made the fifth Life Member of the Association. In the same year, the ODFA gained its first sponsorship, from Tasmanian Breweries (Cascade for the Association and affiliated clubs).
In 1987, the late Ron Bean retired from the position of Secretary/Treasurer, after 30 years to the Association, Ian McElwee of Kempton was appointed Secretary, and Gwenda Cowle of Buckland was appointed Treasurer.
In the same year, the Parattah Football Club went into recess, and Bothwell was admitted to the Association, from the Southern Tasmanian Football Association (not related to the STFA that became the TFL).
In 1988, Ian McElwee resigned as Secretary, and Helen Scott of Woodsdale was appointed Secretary – Mrs Scott is the daughter of the late Ron Bean.
The year 1988 was two more firsts for the Association – the commencement of the Reserves Football Competition, following increased pressure from Kempton, as they had far too many players for only one side.
This caused friction for extremely rural clubs, Mount Pleasant and Woodsdale, and at times Ross, due to the fact that attracting 60 players to the club can prove difficult.
The year 1994 almost saw the end of the reserves, as the three above clubs didn't field reserves sides.
The other first for 1988 was the commencement of the Annual End of Season Dinner and Trophy Presentation, which were held at a variety of locations.
In 1989, Colebrook was re-admitted to the Association, again making it an eight team competition.
On 6 October 1990, Ron Rowlands of Woodsdale was made the sixth Life Member of the Association.
In the same year, the ODFA Secretary completed the work necessary for the Association to become an Incorporated Association.
In 1991, the TANFL Umpires Association pulled the pin on sending umpires to the ODFA (and Tasman Football Association), in turn, the ODFA formed its own Umpires Association, which affiliated with the TFL, and was recognised by the AFL.
In Round 2 1993, Woodsdale kicked 77.29 (491) to Colebrook's 0.1 (1) which still stands as a Tasmanian record score.
On 30 September 1994, Owen Davis, formerly of Ross, then living in Launceston was made the seventh Life Member of the Association.
In January 1995, the Colebrook Football Club went into recess, leaving a seven-team competition, with all clubs fielding reserves.
In 1996 due to the declining number of umpires, the Association disbanded its Umpiring Association, and umpires were sought from the Southern Umpires Association.
In 1998 it became compulsory for clubs wishing to affiliate with the ODFA to field both a Senior and Reserves team, with strict rules pertaining to forfeiture of matches being implemented. On 10 October 1998, at its Annual General Meeting, both Helen Scott and Gwenda Cowle were made Life Members of the Association with the special guest on the night being the late Premier of Tasmania, the Honorable Jim Bacon MHA.
After 1999, the Association saw numerous seasons of chopping and changing teams due to the harsh economic realities of life in country regions, Woodsdale, Ross and Tunnack dropped out.
Summer of 2005–2006.
The biggest change came at the end of the 2005 season when Oatlands, Kempton and Bothwell decided to resign from the ODFA, merge with each other and joined the SFL Regional League as the Central Hawks from 2006. Triabunna, which had joined the Association in 2002 from the now defunct Tasman Football Association, also moved to the SFL.
This left only Mount Pleasant and Swansea before Woodsdale and Ross reformed – Woodsdale had previously went into recess from the Association a few years earlier because of their inability to field a reserve side, however there is currently no reserve grade competition.
2007-2013 Competition expands.
2007 saw Campania Football Club be reformed and join the ODFA making the association a 5-team competition.
During the 2008 season, Ross were expelled from the association due to disciplinary problems involving the club. 
In 2009 the competition saw the addition of former NTFA Division Two club Campbell Town to replace Ross. At the end of 2010 a group of football supporters formed the Tasman Peninsula Football Club which entered the competition in 2011 season. Even though they did not win a game they came close on several occasions and drew with Woodsdale at Nubeena.
In September 2012 Bothwell split from its merger of the Central Hawks. As a club spokesman said "There has only been two games a season in Bothwell. We had sort of lost the community aspect of the club so it was decided last September the club would try to re-form." This ignored the fact that 2 games were moved after the local council closed the ground after bad weather, something not controlled by the Central

Claude Grunitzky

Claude Grunitzky (b. Feb 28, 1971 in Lomé, Togo) is a journalist, editor and entrepreneur. A graduate of the University of London and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he is best known as founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle publication TRACE, an international fashion and music title, and as a co-founder of the TRACE TV network. He runs TRUE, a transcultural think tank and consultancy through a strategic partnership with leading network TBWA\Worldwide, and is often involved in organizing international cultural exhibitions and events.
Biography.
Grunitzky grew up in the Togolese capital of Lomé. His greatuncle was Nicolas Grunitzky, former president of Togo. When Grunitzky was eight years old, his family left Togo for the United States, where his father had been appointed ambassador to Washington. Four years later, Grunitzky moved to France to study at the Catholic boarding school College de Juilly and, later, at the Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris Sciences-Po. 
At the age of 20, Grunitzky moved to London after a year at Sciences Po, to pursue studies in economics at London University. It was there that he embarked on his career in journalism, writing for Dazed & Confused, The Big Issue and The Guardian. In 1995, at the age of 24, he launched TRUE magazine, which met with immediate critical success and was renamed TRACE a year later. In 1998, he uprooted to New York and oversaw the magazine as it carved a niche for itself in the world of independent publishing, with its own distinctive brand of transcultural reportage. As the magazine grew in influence, he co-founded TRUE Agency, a specialized advertising agency based in Los Angeles and Nashville. In February 2003, Grunitzky and business partners Richard Wayner and Olivier Laouchez completed a multimillion-dollar financing deal led by Goldman Sachs Group. As a result, the TRACE brand is now being leveraged globally across various television, radio, mobile, event and interactive platforms. 
Grunitzky, a frequent contributor to the French weekly “Courrier International,” has worked as an associate producer on the BBC’s “The Works” series. He currently advises global corporations and governments in the fields of digital innovation, diversity and social responsibility. In 2008, Grunitzky co-curated, with the cultural services of the French Embassy in the United States, the “I Kiffe NY” festival, devoted to bringing the best of French urban culture to New York City. Grunitzky is also a board member of Humanity in Action, a non-profit organization which works to build global leadership, defend democracy, protect minorities and improve human rights in Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, and the United States. In December 2013, Grunitzky became a director at the World Policy Institute, a non-partisan source of informed policy leadership.
As a Sloan Fellow at the MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Grunitzky earned an MBA. In November 2011, he was appointed a lecturer on "Thought Leadership" during MIT's Sloan Innovation Period. In January 2012, he travelled to Lomé, Togo, and officially announced the launch of his new venture, True Africa, on his blog.
Ventures.
Trace Magazine 
Born out of the short-lived TRUE magazine, TRACE was started by Grunitzky in London in 1996. Beginning life as predominantly an urban culture magazine, TRACE’s identity was quickly influenced by Grunitzky’s nascent interest in what he termed ‘transculturalism’ – a phenomenon referring to those individuals who, in their lifestyles, transcend all traditional sociological notions of race, class or gender. Although the magazine’s front pages continued to feature stellar figures from the rap and R&B scenes, including Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige and Rihanna, the establishment of ‘country themed’ issues, beginning with ‘Brasil 2000’, marked a clear step in the direction of an explicitly international approach to popular culture.
True Agency
In 2002, Grunitzky co-founded the TRUE, Agency, a marketing agency, consultancy and think tank based in LA in partnership with business partner Richard Wayner and the TBWA\Worldwide group. The agency currently operates out of New York, London and Paris.
Trace Television 
In 2003, Grunitzky also launched TRACE TV, the world’s first international urban music channel, with Richard Wayner and Olivier Laouchez, in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Groupe Lagardère. TRACE TV, which is now broadcast in over 150 countries, was successfully sold to European investors in July 2010, ending Grunitzky's involvement with the company.

Asajj Ventress

Asajj Ventress is a fictional character from the "Star Wars" series during the Clone Wars, voiced by Nika Futterman and Grey DeLisle. A powerful Force warrior with exceptional combat abilities, she wields dual curved lightsabers that can attach together and form a double bladed weapon with a curve in the middle.
Character origins.
Before the character of Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus was developed, the Art Department for "" developed "a Sith villainess" by Dermot Power.
When the Expanded Universe resurrected this female Sith idea as one of Dooku's underlings who could appear more frequently throughout the Clone Wars, this nameless Separatist Commander was dubbed 'Juno Eclipse' but the name was rejected as "not villainous enough" and she was renamed 'Asajj Ventress' (while 'Juno Eclipse' was later recycled for use in the "" project).
LucasArts's Leland Chee suggested using "Asajj" as the character's first name, naming her after Asaji from Akira Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood".
Appearances.
"Star Wars: Clone Wars".
In the 2003 micro-series "", Asajj Ventress appears as an antagonist. 
When Count Dooku arrives to add the planet Rattatak to his Separatist movement, Ventress defeats every other combatant in a large arena and claims to be a Sith warrior. When Dooku laughs aside her notion, Ventress tries to attack him but is rendered unconscious with Sith Lord's Force lightning. After she wakes, Dooku attacks her again, but she jumps backwards and ignites her lightsabers. In her quarters, a short duel takes place to which the Sith Lord cuts her two lightsabers in half, rendering her defenseless. Although Ventress is defeated, Dooku is impressed and recruits her by appealing to her hatred of the Jedi. Darth Sidious personally assigns her to kill Anakin Skywalker, and Dooku presents the Dark Jedi with a new pair of lightsabers with curved hilts. After she leaves, Sidious remarks that she is certain to fail, but that she will serve as a useful test for Anakin.
Ventress then engages the Republic fighter forces in orbit of Muunilinst and lures Anakin into a chase. Ventress and Anakin go to Yavin IV, and a fierce battle from the forest to the Massassi temple. Though she initially gains the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel, Anakin calls upon his immense connection to the Force and brutally overpowers her, causing her to fall over the edge of a cliff.

In the film, Ventress helps Count Dooku in his plot to kidnap Jabba the Hutt's son Rotta. Ventress fights Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice Ahsoka Tano, and later battles Obi-Wan Kenobi. The latter defeats her, and she is forced to flee.
In the first season of the TV series, Ventress travels to the moon of Rugosa as Dooku's emissary to form an alliance between the planet Toydaria and the Separatists. The king is reluctant, but he allows her forces to face Yoda in battle to prove which side is superior. When the king decides to side with the Republic, Dooku gives his assassin permission to kill the king so they may have a better chance with his successor. Yoda thwarts her attempt, however, and she is forced to flee.

In the third season, Ventress and Grevious attack Kamino, and almost steal a DNA template of Jango Fett from the production facility. Later, her back story is explained: she hails from the planet Dathomir and was sold by the Nightsisters to criminals. She would have likely been killed in a pirate raid if not for Jedi Ky Narec, who had crashed on Rattatak. Narec sensed her potential and trained her in the ways of the Force. However, warlord Osika Kirske's kills Narec before Ventress can become a full-fledged Jedi.

When she arrives on Savage's spaceship, she confronts her former servant and Darth Maul as they are about to kill Obi-Wan. Ventress teams up with her old nemesis to fight Maul and Opress, but they are ultimately forced to escape in their shuttle.
In the fifth season's finale arc, Ventress returns to go after Ahsoka for the bounty on her head in the lower levels of the planet Coruscant. She ultimately feels a kinship with the young padawan, however, and helps her escape on the condition that she would be pardoned for her crimes. Ventress helps Ahsoka reach her destination, but Dark Jedi Barriss Offee knocks her out and steals her helmet and lightsabers. When Anakin goes after her, believing she had framed Ahsoka, Ventress tells him her side of the story and directs him to the real culprit Offee.

Grievous arrives to rescue the two Dark Jedi, shaming Ventress in their master Dooku's eyes.
Ventress then travels to Coruscant to kill Vos and Obi-Wan. During the mission, she discovers Anakin's secret marriage to Senator Padmé Amidala. Enraged, Anakin engages Ventress. During the duel, Ventress scars Skywalker's face but she is once again overpowered and suffers another huge fall. Republic Intelligence assumes that she is dead.
"Obsession" marks the character's final appearance in "Republic". Ventress survives her encounter with Anakin on Coruscant but is badly injured. She is sent to Boz Pity where Dooku places her in a bacta tank and fits her with cybernetic modifications. One month later, Obi-Wan infiltrates the facility. Ventress wakes up and subsequently attacks him. She fights against both Obi-Wan and Anakin but is abandoned when Dooku orders an IG-100 MagnaGuard to kill her as she runs towards Dooku's shuttle. Enraged and badly wounded, Ventress tries to kill Obi-Wan as he tries to help her. Anakin slashes her from behind, mortally wounding her. As she lays dying, she tells him the location of the Separatists' next target. Believing Ventress to be dead, Obi-Wan puts her on a ship bound for Coruscant. However, Ventress survives by placing herself in a Sith trance. While on the shuttle, she emerges from her trance and orders the pilots to take her as far away as possible from Dooku, the Jedi, and the war.

Alec Guinness

Sir Alec Guinness, (2 April 19145 August 2000) was an English actor. After an early career on the stage he was featured in several of the Ealing Comedies, including "The Ladykillers" and "Kind Hearts and Coronets" in which he played eight different characters. However, he was probably best known for his six collaborations with David Lean: Herbert Pocket in "Great Expectations" (1946), Fagin in "Oliver Twist" (1948), Col. Nicholson in "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), Prince Faisal in "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), Yevgraf in "Doctor Zhivago" (1965), and Professor Godbole in "A Passage to India" (1984). He is also well known for his portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas’s original "Star Wars" trilogy, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
Guinness was one of three major British actors, along with Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud, who, immediately after the Second World War, successfully transitioned from Shakespearean theatre in their home country to Hollywood blockbusters. As well as an Academy Award, he has also won a BAFTA Award, Golden Globe and a Tony Award. In 1959, he was knighted by Elizabeth II for services to the arts. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, received the Academy Honorary Award for lifetime achievement in 1980, and the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award in 1989.
Early life.
Guinness was born at 155 Lauderdale Mansions South, Lauderdale Road, Maida Vale, London as Alec Guinness de Cuffe. His mother's maiden name was Agnes Cuff. She was born 8 December 1890 to Edward Cuff and Mary Ann Benfield. On Guinness's birth certificate, the space for the mother's name shows "Agnes de Cuffe". The space for the infant's name (where first names only are given) says "Alec Guinness". The column for name and surname of father is blank.
The identity of Guinness's father has never been officially confirmed although it has been speculated that he may have been a member of the Anglo-Irish Guinness family. From 1875, under English law, when the birth of an illegitimate child was registered, the father's name could be entered on the certificate only if he were present and gave his consent. Guinness himself believed that his father was a Scottish banker, Andrew Geddes (1861-1928), who paid for Guinness's private school education. Geddes occasionally visited Guinness and his mother, posing as an uncle. 
Guinness was uninterested in his mother, who later had a short marriage to a violent, shell-shocked veteran of the Irish War of Independence.
Early career and war service.
Guinness first worked writing advertising copy. His first job in the theatre was on his 20th birthday, while he was still a drama student, in the play "Libel", which opened at the old King's Theatre, Hammersmith, and then transferred to the Playhouse where his status was raised from a walk-on to understudying two lines and his salary increased to £1 a week. He appeared at the Albery Theatre in 1936 at the age of 22, playing the role of Osric in John Gielgud's successful production of "Hamlet". 1936 also saw Guinness sign on with the Old Vic, where he was cast in a series of classic roles. During this time he worked with many actors and actresses who would become his friends and frequent co-stars in the future, including John Gielgud, Peggy Ashcroft, Anthony Quayle and Jack Hawkins. An early influence from afar was Stan Laurel, whom Guinness admired.
Guinness continued playing Shakespearean roles throughout his career. In 1937 he played Aumerle in "Richard II" and Lorenzo in "The Merchant of Venice" under the direction of John Gielgud. He starred in a 1938 production of "Hamlet" which won him acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. He also appeared as Romeo in a production of "Romeo and Juliet" (1939), Andrew Aguecheek in "Twelfth Night" and as Exeter in "Henry V" in 1937, both opposite Laurence Olivier, and Ferdinand in "The Tempest", opposite Gielgud as Prospero.
In 1939, he adapted Charles Dickens' novel "Great Expectations" for the stage, playing the part of Herbert Pocket. The play was a success. One of its viewers was a young British film editor, David Lean, who would later have Guinness reprise his role in Lean's 1946 film adaptation of the play.
Guinness served in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in World War II, serving first as a seaman in 1941 and being commissioned the following year. He commanded a landing craft taking part in the invasion of Sicily and Elba and later ferried supplies to the Yugoslav partisans.
During the war, he was granted leave to appear in the Broadway production of Terence Rattigan's play "Flare Path", about the RAF Bomber Command.
Postwar stage career.
Guinness returned to the Old Vic in 1946 and stayed until 1948, playing Abel Drugger in Ben Jonson's "The Alchemist", the Fool in "King Lear" opposite Laurence Olivier in the title role, DeGuiche in "Cyrano de Bergerac" opposite Ralph Richardson in the title role, and finally starring in an Old Vic production as Shakespeare's Richard II. After leaving the Old Vic, he played Eric Birling in J. B. Priestley's "An Inspector Calls" at the New Theatre in October 1946. He played the Uninvited Guest in the Broadway production of T. S. Eliot's "The Cocktail Party" (1950, revived at the Edinburgh Festival in 1968). His third attempt at the title role of "Hamlet", this time under his own direction at the New Theatre (1951), proved a major theatrical disaster.
Invited by his friend Tyrone Guthrie to join the premiere season of the Stratford Festival of Canada, Guinness lived for a brief time in Stratford, Ontario. On 13 July 1953, Guinness spoke the first lines of the first play produced by the festival, Shakespeare's "Richard III": "Now is the winter of our discontent/Made glorious summer by this sun of York."
Guinness won a Tony Award for his Broadway performance as poet Dylan Thomas in "Dylan". He next played the title role in "Macbeth" opposite Simone Signoret at the Royal Court Theatre in 1966, a conspicuous failure.
Guinness made his final stage performance at the Comedy Theatre on 30 May 1989, in the play "A Walk in the Woods". In all, between 2 April 1934 and 30 May 1989, he played 77 parts in the theatre.
Film career.
In films, Guinness was initially associated mainly with the Ealing Comedies, and particularly for playing eight different characters in "Kind Hearts and Coronets". Other films from this period included "The Lavender Hill Mob", "The Ladykillers", and "The Man in the White Suit". In 1952, director Ronald Neame cast Guinness in his first romantic lead role, opposite Petula Clark in "The Card". In 1951, exhibitors voted him the most popular British star.
Other notable film roles of this period included "The Swan" (1956) with Grace Kelly, in her second to last film role; "The Horse's Mouth" (1958) in which Guinness played the part of drunken painter Gulley Jimson as well as contributing the screenplay, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award; the lead in Carol Reed's "Our Man in Havana" (1959); Marcus Aurelius in "The Fall of the Roman Empire" (1964); "The Quiller Memorandum" (1966); Marley's Ghost in "Scrooge" (1970); Charles I in "Cromwell" (1970); Pope Innocent III in Franco Zeffirelli's "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" (1972); and the title role in "" (1973), which he considered his best film performance, though critics disagreed. Another role which is sometimes referred to as one which he considered his best, and is so considered by many critics, is that of Colonel Jock Sinclair in "Tunes of Glory" (1960). Guinness also played the role of Jamessir Bensonmum, the blind butler, in the 1976 Neil Simon film "Murder by Death".
David Lean.
Guinness won particular acclaim for his work with director David Lean, which today is his best-known and most critically acclaimed work. After appearing in Lean's "Great Expectations" and "Oliver Twist", he was given a starring role opposite William Holden in "The Bridge on the River Kwai". For his performance as Colonel Nicholson, the unyielding British POW commanding officer, Guinness won an Academy Award. Despite a difficult and often hostile relationship, Lean, referring to Guinness as "my good luck charm", continued to cast Guinness in character roles in his later films: Arab leader Prince Feisal in "Lawrence of Arabia"; the title character's half-brother, Bolshevik leader Yevgraf, in "Doctor Zhivago"; and Indian mystic Professor Godbole in "A Passage to India". He was also offered a role in Lean's "Ryan's Daughter" (1970), but declined. By that time, Guinness had "mistrusted" Lean and considered the earlier close relationship as strained; although at his funeral, he recalled that the famed director had been "charming and affable".
"Star Wars".
Guinness's role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original "Star Wars" trilogy, beginning in 1977, brought him worldwide recognition by a new generation, as well as Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. In letters to his friends, Guinness described the film as "fairy tale rubbish," but the film's sense of moral good – and the studio's doubling of his initial salary offer – appealed to him, and he signed on. He was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be a box office hit; he negotiated a deal for 2% of the gross royalties paid to the director, George Lucas, who received one fifth of the box office takings. This made him very wealthy in his later life, and he agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film. Upon his first viewing of the film, Guinness wrote in his diary that "It's a pretty staggering film as spectacle and technically brilliant. Exciting, very noisy and warm-hearted. The battle scenes at the end go on for five minutes too long, I feel, and some of the dialogue is excruciating and much of it is lost in noise, but it remains a vivid experience."
However, Guinness soon became unhappy with being identified with the part, and expressed dismay at the fan-following that the "Star Wars" trilogy attracted. In the DVD commentary of the original "Star Wars", director George Lucas says that Guinness was not happy with the script re-write in which Obi-Wan is killed. However, Guinness said in a 1999 interview that it was actually his idea to kill off Obi-Wan, persuading Lucas that it would make him a stronger character, and that Lucas agreed to the idea. Guinness stated in the interview, "What I didn't tell Lucas was that I just couldn't go on speaking those bloody awful, banal lines. I'd had enough of the mumbo jumbo." He went on to say that he "shrivelled up" every time "Star Wars" was mentioned to him.
Although Guinness disliked the fame that followed work he did not esteem, Lucas and fellow cast members Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, both on and off the set. Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming. Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him "no complaints; let me leave it by saying I can live for the rest of my life in the reasonably modest way I am now used to, that I have no debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me." In his autobiography, "Blessings In Disguise", Guinness tells an imaginary interviewer "Blessed be "Star Wars"", regarding the income it provided.
In the final volume of the book "A Positively Final Appearance" (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an autograph to a young fan who claimed to have watched "Star Wars" over 100 times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film, because, as Guinness told him, "this is going to be an ill effect on your life." The fan was stunned at first, but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness is quoted as saying: "'Well,' I said, 'do you think you could promise never to see Star Wars again?' He burst into tears. His mother drew herself up to an immense height. 'What a dreadful thing to say to a child!' she barked, and dragged the poor kid away. Maybe she was right but I just hope the lad, now in his thirties, is not living in a fantasy world of secondhand, childish banalities." Guinness grew so tired of modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from "Star Wars" fans without reading it.
Television appearances.
From the 1970s, Guinness made regular television appearances in Britain, including the part of George Smiley in the serialisations of two novels by John le Carré: "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" and "Smiley's People". He twice won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for the roles, and Le Carré was so impressed by Guinness's performance as Smiley that he based his characterisation of Smiley in subsequent novels on Guinness. One of Guinness's last appearances was in the BBC drama "Eskimo Day" (1996).
Awards and honours.
Guinness won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1957 for his role in "The Bridge on the River Kwai" after having been unsuccessfully nominated in 1952 for his performance in "The Lavender Hill Mob". He was nominated in 1958 for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, for his screenplay adapted from Joyce Cary's novel "The Horse's Mouth". He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in "" in 1977. He received an Academy Honorary Award for lifetime achievement in 1980. In 1988, he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for "Little Dorrit". He received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award for lifetime achievement in 1989.
For his theatre work, he received an Evening Standard Award for his performance as T.E. Lawrence in "Ross" and a Tony Award for his Broadway turn as Dylan Thomas in "Dylan". Guinness received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1559 Vine Street on 8 February 1960.
Guinness was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1955, and was knighted in 1959. In 1991, he received an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University. Three years later, at age 80, he was appointed a Companion of Honour.
Personal life.
Guinness married the artist, playwright and actress Merula Sylvia Salaman (1914 –2000) in 1938; in 1940, they had a son, Matthew Guinness, who later became an actor.
In his biography, "Alec Guinness: The Unknown", Garry O'Connor alleges that Guinness was arrested and fined 10 guineas (£10.50) for a homosexual act in a public lavatory in Liverpool in 1946. Guinness is said to have avoided publicity by giving his name to police and court as "Herbert Pocket", the name of the character he played in "Great Expectations". The allegation was not made until April 2001, eight months after his death when a BBC News article claimed that Guinness was in fact bisexual and that he had successfully kept his sexuality private from the public eye as his closest friends and family members also knew he had sexual relationships with men. Piers Paul Read, Guinness's official biographer, doubts that this incident actually occurred. He believes that Guinness was confused with John Gielgud, who was notoriously arrested for such an act around the same time.
Religious conversion.
While serving in the Royal Navy, Guinness had planned to become an Anglican priest. However, in 1954, while he was filming "Father Brown" in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child apparently did not notice that Guinness did not understand him, but took his hand and chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved and trotted off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor. When their son was ill with polio at the age of eleven, Guinness began visiting a church to pray. A few years later in 1956 Guinness converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His wife followed suit in 1957 while he was in Sri Lanka filming "The Bridge on the River Kwai", and she informed him only after the event. Every morning, Guinness recited a verse from "Psalm 143", "Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning".
Death.
Guinness died on 5 August 2000, from liver cancer, at Midhurst in West Sussex. He had been receiving hospital treatment for glaucoma, and had recently also been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was interred at Petersfield, Hampshire. His widow, Lady Guinness, died of cancer at Petersfield, two months after her husband, also aged 86, and was interred alongside her husband of 62 years.
Autobiographies and biography.
Guinness wrote three volumes of a best-selling autobiography, beginning with "Blessings in Disguise" in 1985, followed by "My Name Escapes Me" in 1996, and "A Positively Final Appearance" in 1999. He recorded each of them as an audiobook. Shortly after his death, Lady Guinness asked the couple's close friend and fellow Catholic, novelist Piers Paul Read, to write Guinness's official biography. It was published in 2003.
Filmography.
Box office ranking in Britain.
For a number of years, British film exhibitors voted Guinness among the most popular stars in Britain at the box office via an annual poll in the "Motion Picture Herald".

The channel will not have specific time slots for all the regional studios, nor will it broadcast on a regional level. It will broadcast nationwide the same regional report. 
<br clear=both>
On December 5th 2013, TVR3 Verde aired a program containing anti-semitic texts. On a Christmas program, some anti-semitic lyrics were sang by Dor Transilvan Ensemble, featuring lyrics such as "The Kikes, damn Kikes, holy god would not leave the kikes alive, neither in heaven or on earth, only in the chimney as smoke, this is what the Kike is good for, to make kike smoke through the chimney on the street".
In a statement, TVR3 distanced itself from the broadcast, saying it did not select the carol but only broadcast songs that were chosen and compiled by Center for Preservation and Promotion of Traditional Culture, which belongs to the eastern county of Cluj.

Arta Dobroshi

Arta Dobroshi (Albanian: "Arta Dobroshi") (born 2 October 1980) is a Kosovar-Albanian actress, often cited for her striking presence and ability to breathe authentic life into the roles she plays. She is the first Kosovar actress in history to walk the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival, the Berlin Film Festival and the Sundance Film Festival and be nominated for the European Film Award.
Early life.
Arta Dobroshi was born in Pristina, SFR Yugoslavia to Kosovo Albanian parents. She has been studying the performing arts since elementary school and attended the Academy of Arts acting and drama course in Pristina, which lasted for four years. She starred in many short films and theatre plays whilst a student there. When Arta was fifteen, she went on a student exchange program to America, where she starred in drama plays. Dobroshi has a strong work ethic, known to rehearse for a role eight hours or more a day.
In war.
As a teenager in Kosovo, the odds were stacked against her. After her first year at the academy, the Kosovo war escalated. Dobroshi's grandparents were imprisoned by the Serbian regime because they were trying to open a university in Kosovo. In 1999, Serbian soldiers stormed a bar in Pristina and opened fire. Almost all the customers, including one of Dobroshi's professors at the Pristina Academy of Arts and a good friend of hers, also an actress, were shot dead. Another friend survived with a bullet in her head. During this period, Dobroshi was in Macedonia where she was helping set up a refugee camp for the International Medical Corps, working with people who had been severely traumatized by the war. When Milosevic resigned, she quit her job there, and became a translator for NATO.
Career.
After the war period, She took roles in the local theaters and Albanian movies, as well as a leading role in the prize-winning German-Albanian production Magic Eye (2005), a film about the situation in Albania in 1997, when it was rocked by unrest.
Lorna's Silence.
While in Sarajevo doing a play in Bosnian, Dobroshi came into contact with the Dardenne brothers and offered her an open casting in Kosovo for "Lorna's Silence". Two weeks after the casting, Dobroshi was called up by the Dardenne brothers, asking her to go to Belgium to do two scenes in French with Jérémie Renier and Fabrizio Rongione. After learning the two scenes phonetically and after finishing the two days of shooting, she was given the role. She mastered the French language in an eight-week period before shooting
Dobroshi came to international prominence for her portrayal of Lorna in Luc and Jean-Piere Dardenne's "Lorna's Silence" in which she played the title role to great acclaim and received international media attention. The film was awarded in Cannes 2008. In the same year Dobroshi was nominated for her role, in the Best Actress category, at the European Film Awards and at the Toronto Film Critics Association Awards 2009.
""Lorna's Silence" is her fourth feature and it meant a big jump in her career. International fame and acclamation came altogether, and that gave her global attention".
Dobroshi received high praise from the film industry press:
""The radiant Dobroshi illuminates her physical and moral struggles with grit, conviction and a grace that shines all the more brightly amid the gloomy world from which it springs. Lorna may be lost, but here is an actress who, at every turn, knows exactly what she's doing."" Variety (28 Aug. 2008) 
"Baby".
Dobroshi starred in the short film "Baby" by BAFTA winning director Daniel Mulloy. "Baby" won the Best Short Film Award when it premièred at the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2010 and won Best International Short Film at Cork Film Festival. It was awarded the highly coveted Best Short Film Award at the British Independent Film Awards Best International Short Film at Flickerfest and will have its US premiere at the Sundance Film Festival 2011. Dobroshi was awarded Best Actress for her role in "Baby" at the 24fps International Short Film Festival
Current works.
Dobroshi has completed filming on Julie Gavras' "Late Bloomers" alongside William Hurt and Isabella Rossellini.
Dobroshi stars in "Trois Mondes" which will have its premiere in the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.
Dobroshi is working on "Nëna", with her director from "Baby", Daniel Mulloy. The film is set in Kosovo's capital Pristina. "Nëna" will see Arta Dobroshi accept her first role on her home soil for many years. The film, financed by the UNDP, will be shot in the Albanian language and is the first project that Dobroshi will join as producer.
Other work.
Dobroshi was a jury member of the 59th Berlin International Film Festival.
On 22 December 2008, Dobroshi was appointed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a MDG Champion / Goodwill Ambassador for Kosovo. The UNDP were impressed by her previous charity work and believed that her high profile would help raise awareness on issues.
Personal life.
Dobroshi can speak Albanian, English, French, and can understand Macedonian.

The Best of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Vol. 1

The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1 is a 1978 compilation album collecting the charting singles of Earth, Wind & Fire. In addition to collecting previously charting songs, the album also presented two tracks which were a cover of the Beatles' song "Got to Get You Into My Life" and the original track "September", both of which also became charting singles, the former also winning a Grammy Award.
The compilation album itself placed on three Billboard charts, reaching No. 3 on Black Albums, No. 6 on Pop Albums. It reached No. 6 on the album charts in Britain. The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1 has been certified as quintuple platinum in the US by the RIAA for sales of over 5,000,000 copies. The album has also been certified platinum in the UK and in Canada by the British Phonographic Industry and Music Canada respectively.
"The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1" is ranked numbers 30 and 44 on Allmusic's list of the Top urban and R&B albums of all time respectively.
Songs.
The album collected a variety of songs, primarily charting hit singles, previously released by the band between 1975 and 1978. In addition to previously released songs, the album included several tracks which had never been on an Earth, Wind & Fire album before. Among them, a cover of the Beatles' song "Got to Get You Into My Life" recorded by the band for the film "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" had previously been published on the film's soundtrack, but "September" was new. Both of these songs also became charting singles.
"Got to Get You Into My Life" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Black Singles chart, No. 9 on the Pop Singles chart and No. 33 on the British singles charts, while "September" reached No. 1 on Black Singles, No. 8 on Pop Singles and No. 3 on the British charts. "Got to Get You Into My Life" also won a Grammy Award for "Best Instrument Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)/Best Background Arrangement" for Earth, Wind & Fire's Maurice White. Also, the Skip Scarborough-penned "Love Music" was also a new album track. The album has been reissued with two bonus tracks: "MegaMix 2000" and "MegaMix (Radio Edit)."
Critical reception.
Although EWF would go on to other charting hits, this volume is described by Allmusic as "still...a strong encapsulation of EWF the funk innovators." It is for this reason, their reviewer notes, that even though new and more definitive greatest hits albums have been released, this one has been reissued and remastered, as "for the budget-minded and the disco-phobic, this still makes for an excellent listen." Music critic Robert Christgau describes this volume as "the best album" EWF "ever released", with "ten exquisitely crafted pop tunes in which all the passion and resonance of black music tradition are blended into a concoction slicker and more sumptuous than any white counterpart since Glenn Miller."
Samples.
Love Music was sampled by Ghostface Killah on his track Good featured on his 2006 album More Fish. September has been sampled by Crystal Waters on her track Say...If You Feel Alright on her 1996 album Crystal Waters.

Ewan McGregor

Ewan Gordon McGregor, (; born 31 March 1971) is a Scottish actor who has had success in mainstream, indie, and art house films. He is perhaps best known for his roles as heroin addict Mark Renton in the drama "Trainspotting" (1996), Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi in the "Star Wars" prequel trilogy (1999–2005), poet Christian in the musical film "Moulin Rouge!" (2001), and storyteller Edward Bloom in Tim Burton's "Big Fish" (2003). He has also received critical acclaim for his starring roles in theatre productions of "Guys and Dolls" (2005–07) and "Othello" (2007–08). McGregor was ranked No. 36 on "Empire" magazine's "The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time" list in 1997.
Early life.
Born in the Royal Infirmary in Perth, Scotland, McGregor was brought up in the nearby small town of Crieff, where he attended the independent Morrison's Academy. His mother, Carole Diane (née Lawson), is a teacher and school administrator, and his father, James Charles Stewart "Jim" McGregor, is a physical education teacher. He has an older brother, Colin, who is a former Tornado GR4 pilot in the Royal Air Force. He is the nephew of actor Denis Lawson and actress Sheila Gish, and the step-cousin of actress Lou Gish. McGregor studied drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
Career.
Film and television.
In 1993, six months prior to his graduation from Guildhall, McGregor won a leading role in Dennis Potter's six-part Channel 4 series "Lipstick on Your Collar". That same year, he starred in the BBC adaptation of "Scarlet and Black" with a young Rachel Weisz, and made his film debut in Bill Forsyth's "Being Human". In 1994, McGregor earned critical praise for his performance in the thriller "Shallow Grave", for which he won an Empire Award, and which marked his first collaboration with director Danny Boyle. His international breakthrough followed in 1996 with the role of heroin addict Mark Renton in Boyle's "Trainspotting", an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel of the same name. 
McGregor played the male romantic lead in the 1998 British film "Little Voice". In 1999, McGregor starred in the blockbuster ' as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, a role originally made famous by Sir Alec Guinness in the original "Star Wars" trilogy. By appearing in "Star Wars", he continued a family tradition of sorts: his uncle, Denis Lawson, had played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy. In 2001, he starred in "Moulin Rouge!" as the young poet Christian, who falls in love with the terminally-ill courtesan Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. McGregor reprised his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi for the subsequent prequel ' in 2002. In 2003, he starred alongside Renée Zellweger in "Down With Love". He also portrayed the younger Edward Bloom in the critically acclaimed film "Big Fish" alongside Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman and Billy Crudup. During that year, he also received critical acclaim for his portrayal of an amoral drifter mixed up with murder in the drama "Young Adam", which co-starred Tilda Swinton.
In 2005, McGregor appeared for the final time as Obi-Wan Kenobi in "". He took very special care—especially in "Revenge of the Sith"—to ensure that his portrayal of Obi-Wan's mannerisms, speech timings, and accents closely resembled Alec Guinness' version. That same year, McGregor lent his voice to two successful animated features; he played the robot Rodney Copperbottom in "Robots", which also featured the voices of Halle Berry and Robin Williams, and he voiced the lead character in Gary Chapman's "Valiant", alongside Jim Broadbent, John Cleese and Ricky Gervais. Also in 2005, McGregor played two roles—one a clone of the other—opposite Scarlett Johansson in Michael Bay's "The Island", and he appeared in Marc Forster's "Stay", a psychological thriller co-starring Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling.
In 2006, he narrated the Fulldome production "Astronaut", created for the National Space Centre. That same year, he also narrated the STV show "JetSet", a six-part series following the lives of student pilots and navigators at RAF Lossiemouth as they undergo a gruelling six-month course learning to fly the Tornado GR4, the RAF's primary attack aircraft. In 2007, McGregor starred opposite Colin Farrell in the Woody Allen film "Cassandra's Dream". In 2009, he co-starred with Jim Carrey in "I Love You Phillip Morris" and appeared in "Amelia" alongside Hilary Swank. Also in 2009, he portrayed Camerlengo Patrick McKenna in "Angels & Demons", the film adaptation of Dan Brown's novel of the same name. McGregor is scheduled to co-star with Daniel Craig in Dan Harris' upcoming film adaptation of Glen Duncan's novel "I, Lucifer". At the 2011 Seattle International Film Festival, he was awarded with the SIFF Golden Space Needle Award for Outstanding Achievement in Acting.
In 2012, he was named as a member of the Jury for the Main Competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. At the San Sebastián International Film Festival, he was awarded the Donostia Lifetime Achievement Award and became the youngest recipient of the award.
Theatre.
From November 1998 to March 1999, McGregor starred as Malcolm Scrawdyke in a production of David Halliwell's "Little Malcolm and His Struggles Against the Eunuchs", directed by his uncle, Denis Lawson. The play was first staged at the Hampstead Theatre before transferring to the Comedy Theatre in London's West End. In November 2001, McGregor made a cameo appearance in "The Play What I Wrote".
From June 2005 to April 2007, McGregor starred alongside Jane Krakowski, Douglas Hodge, and Jenna Russell in the original Donmar Warehouse production of "Guys and Dolls" at the Piccadilly Theatre in London. He played the leading role of Sky Masterson, made famous by Marlon Brando in the film of the same name. McGregor received the LastMinute.com award for Best Actor for his performance in 2005, and he was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical in 2007.
From December 2007 to February 2008, McGregor starred as Iago in "Othello" at the Donmar Warehouse alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor as Othello and Kelly Reilly as Desdemona. He reprised the role on BBC Radio 3 in May 2008.
Motorcycle journeys.
A motorcyclist since his youth, McGregor undertook a marathon international motorcycle trip with his best friend Charley Boorman and cameraman Claudio von Planta in 2004. From mid-April to the end of July, they travelled from London to New York via central Europe, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Siberian Russia, Canada and USA on BMW R1150GS Adventure motorcycles, for a cumulative distance of 22,345 miles (35,960 km). The trip included visits to several UNICEF programs along the route, and formed the basis of a television series and a best-selling book, both called "Long Way Round".
The "Long Way Round" team reunited in 2007 for another motorcycle trip from John o' Groats in Scotland to Cape Town in South Africa. The journey, entitled "Long Way Down", lasted from 12 May until 5 August 2007. McGregor's brother Colin joined the motorcycle team during the early stages of the "Long Way Down" journey, and his father Jim also rode on sections of both "Long Way Round" and "Long Way Down".
McGregor appeared in a two-part BBC documentary in April 2012 entitled "Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission" in which he travels by motorbike, boat, plane and foot to deliver vaccines to children in remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo. The trip was part of his work as a UNICEF Ambassador.
Personal life.
McGregor is married to Eve Mavrakis, a French production designer. They have four daughters, Clara Mathilde McGregor (born February 1996), Esther Rose McGregor (born November 2001), Jamyan McGregor (born June 2001 in Mongolia; adopted April 2006), and Annouk McGregor (born January 2011; adopted). McGregor has a heart and dagger tattoo of the names of his wife and daughters on his right arm. The family currently resides in Los Angeles, California, after moving from London.
McGregor is involved in charity work, including with UNICEF and GO Campaign. During the "Long Way Round" journey in 2004, McGregor and his travelling companions took time out to see some of UNICEF's work in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and during the "Long Way Down" trip in 2007, he and Charley Boorman did work for UNICEF in Africa. McGregor hosted the annual Hollywood gala for GO Campaign in 2009 and 2010. He has also worked with the Children's Hospice Association Scotland, as featured in "Long Way Down". In 2012 McGregor travelled with UNICEF immunisation workers to remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo for a BBC2 documentary entitled "Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission".
In 2007, on an episode of "Parkinson", McGregor stated that he had given up alcohol after a period where he was arguably a functioning alcoholic, and that he had not had a drink in seven years. In 2008, he had a cancerous mole removed from underneath his right eye.
McGregor was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to drama and charity.

Euphorbia obesa

Euphorbia obesa is a subtropical succulent species of "Euphorbia" genus. It comes from South Africa, especially in the Cape Province.
The plant is dioecious, which means that a subject has only male or female flowers.
In the wild, it is endangered because of over-collection and poaching, because of its slow growth, and the fact that the pod contains only 2 to 3 seeds. However, it is widely cultivated in botanical gardens.
Description.
"Euphorbia obesa" looks like a perfect ball, thornless and extremely decorative. It is commonly known as 'baseball plant' due to its shape.
Its diameter is between 6 cm and 15 cm depending on its age.
Young Euphorbia obesa's are spherical, but become cylindrical with age. They contain water reservoirs for periods of drought.
It almost always shows 8 ridges adorned with small deep gibbosity regularly planted on the edges. 
It is green with horizontal lighter or darker stripes. In the wild, and with exposure to direct sunlight, it shows red and purple areas.
The small flowers are insignificant in apex. In fact, like all "Euphorbia", flowers are called cyathia.
As in all "Euphorbia" species, the latex is toxic.
Living in similar conditions on two different continents, "Euphorbia obesa" presents a form of convergence with "Astrophytum asterias" which is a cactus from Mexico.

<doc id="19673093" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19673093" title="Matter">
Matter

Matter is a loosely defined term in science (see definitions below). The term often refers to a substance (often a particle) that has rest mass. Matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects.
All objects we see with the naked eye are composed of atoms. This atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles—usually a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a cloud of orbiting electrons. 
Typically, science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume. By contrast, massless particles, such as photons, are not considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However, not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered "point particles" with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless, quarks and leptons together make up "ordinary matter," and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter.
Matter commonly exists in four "states" (or "phases"): solid, liquid and gas, and plasma. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates. A focus on an elementary-particle view of matter also leads to new phases of matter, such as the quark–gluon plasma. For much of the history of the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called "particulate theory of matter", was first put forward by the Greek philosophers Leucippus (~490 BC) and Democritus (~470–380 BC).
Albert Einstein showed that ultimately all matter is capable of being converted to energy (known as mass-energy equivalence) by the famous formula "E = mc2", where "E" is the energy of a piece of matter of mass "m", times "c2" the speed of light squared. As the speed of light is , a relatively small amount of matter may be converted to a large amount of energy. An example is that positrons and electrons (matter) may transform into photons (non-matter). However, although matter may be created or destroyed in such processes, neither the quantity of mass or energy change during the process.
Matter should not be confused with mass, as the two are not quite the same in modern physics. For example, mass is a conserved quantity, which means that its value is unchanging through time, within closed systems. However, matter is "not" conserved in such systems, although this is not obvious in ordinary conditions on Earth, where matter is approximately conserved. Still, special relativity shows that matter may disappear by conversion into energy, even inside closed systems, and it can also be created from energy, within such systems. However, because "mass" (like energy) can neither be created nor destroyed, the quantity of mass and the quantity of energy remain the same during a transformation of matter (which represents a certain amount of energy) into non-material (i.e., non-matter) energy. This is also true in the reverse transformation of energy into matter.
Different fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes incompatible, ways. Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter. As such, there is no single universally-agreed scientific meaning of the word "matter." Scientifically, the term "mass" is well-defined, but "matter" is not. Sometimes in the field of physics "matter" is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both physics and chemistry, matter exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, the so-called wave–particle duality.
Definition.
Common definition.
The common definition of matter is "anything that has both mass and volume (occupies space)". For example, a car would be said to be made of matter, as it occupies space, and has mass.
The observation that matter occupies space goes back to antiquity. However, an explanation for why matter occupies space is recent, and is argued to be a result of the Pauli exclusion principle. Two particular examples where the exclusion principle clearly relates matter to the occupation of space are white dwarf stars and neutron stars, discussed further below.
Relativity.
In the context of relativity, mass is not an additive quantity, in the sense that one can add the rest masses of particles in a system to get the total rest mass of the system. Thus, in relativity usually a more general view is that it is not the sum of rest masses, but the energy–momentum tensor that quantifies the amount of matter. This tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system. "Matter" therefore is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to the energy–momentum of a system, that is, anything that is not purely gravity. This view is commonly held in fields that deal with general relativity such as cosmology. But in this view, light and other types of insubstantial energy may be part of matter.
The reason for this is that in this definition, electromagnetic radiation (such as light) as well as the energy of electromagnetic fields contributes to the mass of systems, and therefore appears to add matter to them. For example, light radiation (or thermal radiation) trapped inside a box would contribute to the mass of the box, as would any kind of energy inside the box, including the kinetic energy of particles held by the box. Nevertheless, isolated individual particles of light (photons) and the isolated kinetic energy of massive particles, are normally not considered to be "matter."
A difference between matter and mass therefore may seem to arise when single particles are examined. In such cases, the mass of single photons is zero. For particles with rest mass, such as leptons and quarks, isolation of the particle in a frame where it is not moving, removes its kinetic energy.
A source of definition difficulty in relativity arises from two definitions of mass in common use, one of which is formally equivalent to total energy (and is thus observer-dependent), and the other of which is referred to as rest mass or invariant mass and is independent of the observer. Only the latter type of mass is loosely equated with matter (since it can be weighed). However, energies which contribute to the first type of mass may be weighed also in special circumstances, such as when trapped in a system with no net momentum (as in the box example above). Thus, a photon with no mass may add mass to a system in which it is trapped. Since such mass is measured as part of ordinary "matter" in complex systems, the "matter" status of "massless particles" becomes unclear in such systems. These problems contribute to the lack of a rigorous definition of matter in science, although mass is easier to define as the total stress-energy above (this is also what is weighed on a scale, and what is the source of gravity).
Atoms definition.
A definition of "matter" based on its physical and chemical structure is: "matter is made up of atoms". As an example, deoxyribonucleic acid molecules (DNA) are matter under this definition because they are made of atoms. This definition can extend to include charged atoms and molecules, so as to include plasmas (gases of ions) and electrolytes (ionic solutions), which are not obviously included in the atoms definition. Alternatively, one can adopt the "protons, neutrons, and electrons" definition.
Protons, neutrons and electrons definition.
A definition of "matter" more fine-scale than the atoms and molecules definition is: "matter is made up of what atoms and molecules are made of", meaning anything made of positively charged protons, neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons. This definition goes beyond atoms and molecules, however, to include substances made from these building blocks that are "not" simply atoms or molecules, for example white dwarf matter—typically, carbon and oxygen nuclei in a sea of degenerate electrons. At a microscopic level, the constituent "particles" of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality. At an even deeper level, protons and neutrons are made up of quarks and the force fields (gluons) that bind them together (see Quarks and leptons definition below).
Quarks and leptons definition.
As seen in the above discussion, many early definitions of what can be called "ordinary matter" were based upon its structure or "building blocks". On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: "ordinary matter is everything that is composed of elementary fermions, namely quarks and leptons." The connection between these formulations follows.
Leptons (the most famous being the electron), and quarks (of which baryons, such as protons and neutrons, are made) combine to form atoms, which in turn form molecules. Because atoms and molecules are said to be matter, it is natural to phrase the definition as: "ordinary matter is anything that is made of the same things that atoms and molecules are made of". (However, notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that is "not" atoms or molecules.) Then, because electrons are leptons, and protons, and neutrons are made of quarks, this definition in turn leads to the definition of matter as being "quarks and leptons", which are the two types of elementary fermions. Carithers and Grannis state: "Ordinary matter is composed entirely of first-generation particles, namely the and [down quarks, plus the electron and its neutrino." (Higher generations particles quickly decay into first-generation particles, and thus are not commonly encountered.)
This definition of ordinary matter is more subtle than it first appears. All the particles that make up ordinary matter (leptons and quarks) are elementary fermions, while all the force carriers are elementary bosons. The W and Z bosons that mediate the weak force are not made of quarks or leptons, and so are not ordinary matter, even if they have mass. In other words, mass is not something that is exclusive to ordinary matter.
The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example). Such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite. As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons. However, digging deeper, the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by gluon fields (see dynamics of quantum chromodynamics) and these gluons fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons. In other words, most of what composes the "mass" of ordinary matter is due to the binding energy of quarks within protons and neutrons. For example, the sum of the mass of the three quarks in a nucleon is approximately , which is low compared to the mass of a nucleon (approximately ). The bottom line is that most of the mass of everyday objects comes from the interaction energy of its elementary components.
Smaller building blocks issue.
The Standard Model groups matter particles into three generations, where each generation consists of two quarks and two leptons. The first generation is the "up" and "down" quarks, the "electron" and the "electron neutrino"; the second includes the "charm" and "strange" quarks, the "muon" and the "muon neutrino"; the third generation consists of the "top" and "bottom" quarks and the "tau" and "tau neutrino". The most natural explanation for this would be that quarks and leptons of higher generations are excited states of the first generations. If this turns out to be the case, it would imply that quarks and leptons are composite particles, rather than elementary particles.
Structure.
In particle physics, fermions are particles that obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. Fermions can be elementary, like the electron—or composite, like the proton and neutron. In the Standard Model, there are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons, which are discussed next.
Quarks.
Quarks are particles of spin-, implying that they are fermions. They carry an electric charge of − e (down-type quarks) or + e (up-type quarks). For comparison, an electron has a charge of −1 e. They also carry colour charge, which is the equivalent of the electric charge for the strong interaction. Quarks also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the weak interaction. Quarks are massive particles, and therefore are also subject to gravity.
Baryonic matter.
Baryons are strongly interacting fermions, and so are subject to Fermi-Dirac statistics. Amongst the baryons are the protons and neutrons, which occur in atomic nuclei, but many other unstable baryons exist as well. The term baryon usually refers to triquarks—particles made of three quarks. "Exotic" baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark are known as the pentaquarks, but their existence is not generally accepted.
Baryonic matter is the part of the universe that is made of baryons (including all atoms). This part of the universe does not include dark energy, dark matter, black holes or various forms of degenerate matter, such as compose white dwarf stars and neutron stars. Microwave light seen by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), suggests that only about 4.6% of that part of the universe within range of the best telescopes (that is, matter that may be visible because light could reach us from it), is made of baryonic matter. About 23% is dark matter, and about 72% is dark energy.
Degenerate matter.
In physics, degenerate matter refers to the ground state of a gas of fermions at a temperature near absolute zero. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that only two fermions can occupy a quantum state, one spin-up and the other spin-down. Hence, at zero temperature, the fermions fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermions—and in the case of many fermions, the maximum kinetic energy (called the "Fermi energy") and the pressure of the gas becomes very large, and depends on the number of fermions rather than the temperature, unlike normal states of matter.
Degenerate matter is thought to occur during the evolution of heavy stars. The demonstration by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar that white dwarf stars have a maximum allowed mass because of the exclusion principle caused a revolution in the theory of star evolution.
Degenerate matter includes the part of the universe that is made up of neutron stars and white dwarfs.
Strange matter.
Strange matter is a particular form of quark matter, usually thought of as a "liquid" of up, down, and strange quarks. It is contrasted with nuclear matter, which is a liquid of neutrons and protons (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange matter is expected to be color superconducting. Strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of neutron stars, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from femtometers (strangelets) to kilometers (quark stars).
Two meanings of the term "strange matter".
In particle physics and astrophysics, the term is used in two ways, one broader and the other more specific.
Leptons.
Leptons are particles of spin-, meaning that they are fermions. They carry an electric charge of −1 e (charged leptons) or 0 e (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, leptons do not carry colour charge, meaning that they do not experience the strong interaction. Leptons also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the weak interaction. Leptons are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.
Phases.
[[File:Phase diagram for pure substance.JPG|thumb|250px||Phase diagram for a typical substance at a fixed volume. Vertical axis is "P"ressure, horizontal axis is "T"emperature. The green line marks the freezing point (above the green line is "solid", below it is "liquid") and the blue line the boiling point (above it is "liquid" and below it is "gas"). So, for example, at higher "T", a higher "P" is necessary to maintain the substance in liquid phase. At the triple point the three phases; liquid, gas and solid; can coexist. Above the critical point there is no detectable difference between the phases. The dotted line shows the anomalous behavior of water: ice melts at constant temperature with increasing pressure.]]
In bulk, matter can exist in several different forms, or states of aggregation, known as "phases", depending on ambient pressure, temperature and volume. A phase is a form of matter that has a relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (such as density, specific heat, refractive index, and so forth). These phases include the three familiar ones (solids, liquids, and gases), as well as more exotic states of matter (such as plasmas, superfluids, supersolids, Bose–Einstein condensates, ...). A "fluid" may be a liquid, gas or plasma. There are also paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials. As conditions change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called phase transitions, and are studied in the field of thermodynamics. In nanomaterials, the vastly increased ratio of surface area to volume results in matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those of bulk material, and not well described by any bulk phase (see nanomaterials for more details).
Phases are sometimes called "states of matter", but this term can lead to confusion with thermodynamic states. For example, two gases maintained at different pressures are in different "thermodynamic states" (different pressures), but in the same "phase" (both are gases).
Antimatter.
In particle physics and quantum chemistry, antimatter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute ordinary matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other, the two annihilate; that is, they may both be converted into other particles with equal energy in accordance with Einstein's equation . These new particles may be high-energy photons (gamma rays) or other particle–antiparticle pairs. The resulting particles are endowed with an amount of kinetic energy equal to the difference between the rest mass of the products of the annihilation and the rest mass of the original particle-antiparticle pair, which is often quite large.
Antimatter is not found naturally on Earth, except very briefly and in vanishingly small quantities (as the result of radioactive decay, lightning or cosmic rays). This is because antimatter that came to exist on Earth outside the confines of a suitable physics laboratory would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that Earth is made of, and be annihilated. Antiparticles and some stable antimatter (such as antihydrogen) can be made in tiny amounts, but not in enough quantity to do more than test a few of its theoretical properties.
There is considerable speculation both in science and science fiction as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter, and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter instead. In the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called the charge parity (or CP symmetry) violation. CP symmetry violation can be obtained from the Standard Model, but at this time the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. Possible processes by which it came about are explored in more detail under baryogenesis.
Other types of matter.
[[File:Matter Distribution.JPG|thumb |300px |Pie chart showing the fractions of energy in the universe contributed by different sources. "Ordinary matter" is divided into "luminous matter" (the stars and luminous gases and 0.005% radiation) and "nonluminous matter" (intergalactic gas and about 0.1% neutrinos and 0.04% supermassive black holes). Ordinary matter is uncommon. Modeled after Ostriker and Steinhardt. For more information, see NASA.]]
Ordinary matter, in the quarks and leptons definition, constitutes about 4% of the energy of the observable universe. The remaining energy is theorized to be due to exotic forms, of which 23% is dark matter and 73% is dark energy.

Dark matter.
In astrophysics and cosmology, dark matter is matter of unknown composition that does not emit or reflect enough electromagnetic radiation to be observed directly, but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter. Observational evidence of the early universe and the big bang theory require that this matter have energy and mass, but is not composed of either elementary fermions (as above) OR gauge bosons. The commonly accepted view is that most of the dark-matter is non-baryonic in nature. As such, it is composed of particles as yet unobserved in the laboratory. Perhaps they are supersymmetric particles, which are not Standard Model particles, but relics formed at very high energies in the early phase of the universe and still floating about.
Dark energy.
In cosmology, dark energy is the name given to the antigravitating influence that is accelerating the rate of expansion of the universe. It is known not to be composed of known particles like protons, neutrons or electrons, nor of the particles of dark matter, because these all gravitate.
Exotic matter.
Exotic matter is a hypothetical concept of particle physics. It covers any material that violates one or more classical conditions or is not made of known baryonic particles. Such materials would possess qualities like negative mass or being repelled rather than attracted by gravity.
Historical development.
Origins.
The pre-Socratics were among the first recorded speculators about the underlying nature of the visible world. Thales (c. 624 BC–c. 546 BC) regarded water as the fundamental material of the world. Anaximander (c. 610 BC–c. 546 BC) posited that the basic material was wholly characterless or limitless: the Infinite ("apeiron"). Anaximenes (flourished 585 BC, d. 528 BC) posited that the basic stuff was "pneuma" or air. Heraclitus (c. 535–c. 475 BC) seems to say the basic element is fire, though perhaps he means that all is change. Empedocles (c. 490–430 BC) spoke of four elements of which everything was made: earth, water, air, and fire. Meanwhile, Parmenides argued that change does not exist, and Democritus argued that everything is composed of minuscule, inert bodies of all shapes called atoms, a philosophy called atomism. All of these notions had deep philosophical problems.
Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) was the first to put the conception on a sound philosophical basis, which he did in his natural philosophy, especially in "Physics" book I. He adopted as reasonable suppositions the four Empedoclean elements, but added a fifth, aether. Nevertheless these elements are not basic in Aristotle's mind. Rather they, like everything else in the visible world, are composed of the basic "principles" matter and form.
The word Aristotle uses for matter, ὑλη ("hyle" or "hule"), can be literally translated as wood or timber, that is, "raw material" for building. Indeed, Aristotle's conception of matter is intrinsically linked to something being made or composed. In other words, in contrast to the early modern conception of matter as simply occupying space, matter for Aristotle is definitionally linked to process or change: matter is what underlies a change of substance.
For example, a horse eats grass: the horse changes the grass into itself; the grass as such does not persist in the horse, but some aspect of it—its matter—does. The matter is not specifically described (e.g., as atoms), but consists of whatever persists in the change of substance from grass to horse. Matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e., as a substance), but exists interdependently (i.e., as a "principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. It can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole. For Aristotle, matter as such can only "receive" actuality from form; it has no activity or actuality in itself, similar to the way that parts as such only have their existence "in" a whole (otherwise they would be independent wholes).
Early modernity.
René Descartes (1596–1650) originated the modern conception of matter. He was primarily a geometer. Instead of, like Aristotle, deducing the existence of matter from the physical reality of change, Descartes arbitrarily postulated matter to be an abstract, mathematical substance that occupies space:
For Descartes, matter has only the property of extension, so its only activity aside from locomotion is to exclude other bodies: this is the mechanical philosophy. Descartes makes an absolute distinction between mind, which he defines as unextended, thinking substance, and matter, which he defines as unthinking, extended substance. They are independent things. In contrast, Aristotle defines matter and the formal/forming principle as complementary "principles" that together compose one independent thing (substance). In short, Aristotle defines matter (roughly speaking) as what things are actually made of (with a "potential" independent existence), but Descartes elevates matter to an actual independent thing in itself.
The continuity and difference between Descartes' and Aristotle's conceptions is noteworthy. In both conceptions, matter is passive or inert. In the respective conceptions matter has different relationships to intelligence. For Aristotle, matter and intelligence (form) exist together in an interdependent relationship, whereas for Descartes, matter and intelligence (mind) are definitionally opposed, independent substances.
Descartes' justification for restricting the inherent qualities of matter to extension is its permanence, but his real criterion is not permanence (which equally applied to color and resistance), but his desire to use geometry to explain all material properties. Like Descartes, Hobbes, Boyle, and Locke argued that the inherent properties of bodies were limited to extension, and that so-called secondary qualities, like color, were only products of human perception.
Isaac Newton (1643–1727) inherited Descartes' mechanical conception of matter. In the third of his "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy," Newton lists the universal qualities of matter as "extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and inertia." Similarly in "Optics" he conjectures that God created matter as "solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles," which were "...even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces." The "primary" properties of matter were amenable to mathematical description, unlike "secondary" qualities such as color or taste. Like Descartes, Newton rejected the essential nature of secondary qualities.
Newton developed Descartes' notion of matter by restoring to matter intrinsic properties in addition to extension (at least on a limited basis), such as mass. Newton's use of gravitational force, which worked "at a distance," effectively repudiated Descartes' mechanics, in which interactions happened exclusively by contact.
Though Newton's gravity would seem to be a "power" of bodies, Newton himself did not admit it to be an "essential" property of matter. Carrying the logic forward more consistently, Joseph Priestley argued that corporeal properties transcend contact mechanics: chemical properties require the "capacity" for attraction. He argued matter has other inherent powers besides the so-called primary qualities of Descartes, et al.
Since Priestley's time, there has been a massive expansion in knowledge of the constituents of the material world (viz., molecules, atoms, subatomic particles), but there has been no further development in the "definition" of matter. Rather the question has been set aside. Noam Chomsky summarizes the situation that has prevailed since that time:
So matter is whatever physics studies and the object of study of physics is matter: there is no independent general definition of matter, apart from its fitting into the methodology of measurement and controlled experimentation. In sum, the boundaries between what constitutes matter and everything else remains as vague as the demarcation problem of delimiting science from everything else.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
In the 19th century, following the development of the periodic table, and of atomic theory, atoms were seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter; atoms formed molecules and compounds.
The common definition in terms of occupying space and having mass is in contrast with most physical and chemical definitions of matter, which rely instead upon its structure and upon attributes not necessarily related to volume and mass. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the knowledge of matter began a rapid evolution.
Aspects of the Newtonian view still held sway. James Clerk Maxwell discussed matter in his work "Matter and Motion". He carefully separates "matter" from space and time, and defines it in terms of the object referred to in Newton's first law of motion.
However, the Newtonian picture was not the whole story. In the 19th century, the term "matter" was actively discussed by a host of scientists and philosophers, and a brief outline can be found in Levere. A textbook discussion from 1870 suggests matter is what is made up of atoms:Three divisions of matter are recognized in science: masses, molecules and atoms. A Mass of matter is any portion of matter appreciable by the senses. A Molecule is the smallest particle of matter into which a body can be divided without losing its identity. An Atom is a still smaller particle produced by division of a molecule. 
Rather than simply having the attributes of mass and occupying space, matter was held to have chemical and electrical properties. The famous physicist J. J. Thomson wrote about the "constitution of matter" and was concerned with the possible connection between matter and electrical charge.
Later developments.
There is an entire literature concerning the "structure of matter", ranging from the "electrical structure" in the early 20th century, to the more recent "quark structure of matter", introduced today with the remark: "Understanding the quark structure of matter has been one of the most important advances in contemporary physics." In this connection, physicists speak of "matter fields", and speak of particles as "quantum excitations of a mode of the matter field". And here is a quote from de Sabbata and Gasperini: "With the word "matter" we denote, in this context, the sources of the interactions, that is spinor fields (like quarks and leptons), which are believed to be the fundamental components of matter, or scalar fields, like the Higgs particles, which are used to introduced mass in a gauge theory (and that, however, could be composed of more fundamental fermion fields)."
The modern conception of matter has been refined many times in history, in light of the improvement in knowledge of just "what" the basic building blocks are, and in how they interact.
In the late 19th century with the discovery of the electron, and in the early 20th century, with the discovery of the atomic nucleus, and the birth of particle physics, matter was seen as made up of electrons, protons and neutrons interacting to form atoms. Today, we know that even protons and neutrons are not indivisible, they can be divided into quarks, while electrons are part of a particle family called leptons. Both quarks and leptons are elementary particles, and are currently seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter.
These quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The Standard Model of particle physics is currently the best explanation for all of physics, but despite decades of efforts, gravity cannot yet be accounted for at the quantum-level; it is only described by classical physics (see quantum gravity and graviton). Interactions between quarks and leptons are the result of an exchange of force-carrying particles (such as photons) between quarks and leptons. The force-carrying particles are not themselves building blocks. As one consequence, mass and energy (which cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to matter (which can be created out of non-matter particles such as photons, or even out of pure energy, such as kinetic energy). Force carriers are usually not considered matter: the carriers of the electric force (photons) possess energy (see Planck relation) and the carriers of the weak force (W and Z bosons) are massive, but neither are considered matter either. However, while these particles are not considered matter, they do contribute to the total mass of atoms, subatomic particles, and all systems that contain them.
Summary.
The term "matter" is used throughout physics in a bewildering variety of contexts: for example, one refers to "condensed matter physics", "elementary matter", "partonic" matter, "dark" matter, "anti"-matter, "strange" matter, and "nuclear" matter. In discussions of matter and antimatter, normal matter has been referred to by Alfvén as "koinomatter" (Gk. "common matter"). It is fair to say that in physics, there is no broad consensus as to a general definition of matter, and the term "matter" usually is used in conjunction with a specifying modifier.

United States Penitentiary, Pollock

The United States Penitentiary, Pollock (USP Pollock) is a high-security United States federal prison for male inmates in Louisiana. It is part of the Pollock Federal Correctional Complex (FCC Pollock) and operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice. The facility also has an adjacent satellite prison camp for minimum-security male offenders.
FCC Pollock is located in central Louisiana, approximately 15 miles north of Alexandria.
Notable incidents.
2006 escape.
On April 5, 2006, convicted murderer Richard Lee McNair escaped from USP Pollock. McNair's duties in prison included work in a manufacturing area, where he repaired old, torn mailbags. He held this position for several months, during which he plotted his escape. McNair escaped by constructing an "escape pod," which included a breathing tube, and burying it under a pile of outgoing mailbags. At approximately 9:45 AM, prison staff placed the mailbags on a pallet, transported it to a nearby warehouse outside the prison's perimeter fence, and went for lunch. McNair then cut himself out of the pod and escaped at 11:00 AM. Having observed prison operations and the times when prisoner counts were conducted, McNair knew that his absence would not be discovered until 4:00 PM. After an over yearlong manhunt, McNair was captured in New Brunswick, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Oct. 25, 2007 after being featured on the television program "Americas Most Wanted". Since McNair had previously escaped from a county jail and a state prison in North Dakota in 1987 and 1992, he was classified as a high-escape risk and transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado which holds inmates requiring the tightest controls.
Murders.
In November 2007, inmate William Anthony Bullock was stabbed to death with a shank during an altercation with another inmate, identified as Shaun Wayne Williams. Williams had crafted the shank from a part of a cell locker. Williams, who was serving a 96-month sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in 2009 and sentenced to an additional 15 years in prison.
Inmate Steven Prater, who was serving a 51-month sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm, was fatally injured during a fight with another inmate on June 24, 2010. On January 18, 2010, inmate Carlton Coltrane was stabbed to death by another inmate. Coltrane's mother told The Washington Post that her son, who was serving a sentence for bank robbery, told her several days before that there were running disputes between gangs of inmates from Louisiana and the Washington, DC area. The murders of Prater and Coltrane remain under investigation.

Yim Tin Tsai (Sai Kung)

Yim Tin Tsai (鹽田仔, lit. "Little Salt Field") is a small offshore island in Sai Kung, Hong Kong. There is no permanent population on the island.
Geography.
The island has an area of 0.24 km². It is located in Port Shelter, the harbour located south of Sai Kung Peninsula and east of the Sai Kung mainland. It is connected by a breakwater in its southern part to the larger island of Kau Sai Chau.
The smaller islands of Shek Chau and Kwun Cham Wan are located off the coast of Yim Tin Tsai, in the northwest and the southwest respectively.
History.
The island was settled by members of the Hakka Chan (陳) clan during the 19th century (other sources mention 300 years ago). The Chans came from Yim Tin (鹽田; pinyin: Yántián), now part of the Yantian District of Shenzhen. The new settlement was called "Yim Tin Tsai" in its memory. Other members of the clan settled in Yim Tin Tsai in Tai Po and Ping Yeung, in Ta Kwu Ling, North District. At its peak, Yim Tin Tsai had 500 inhabitants (other sources mention 1,200). Villagers lived on farming, fishing and salt-making. They farmed of salt field, the smallest of the five salt fields in Hong Kong at the time. Other salt fields were in Tai O, Lantau Island, San Hui and Wong Ka Wai in Tuen Mun, Yim Liu Ha in Sha Tau Kok and Yim Tin Tsai in Tai Po.
Baptism of the island's residents started in 1866, and by 1875, all villagers on the island were baptised. In 1879 a chapel was set up by Joseph Freinademetz (who was canonised in 2003).
Ching Po School, the village school closed down in the 1990s due to a lack of students.
A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 17 March 2013 after the village was given approval to revitalise its abandoned salt fields. Chief Secretary Carrie Lam and Vicar General of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong Dominic Chan officiated the ceremony.
Features.
The current St. Joseph's Chapel replaced the first chapel on Yim Tin Tsai. Built in Italian Romanesque style, it was completed in 1890, with a school adjacent to it. The chapel is a Grade III historic building. It has been renovated three times, the last being in 2004.

Jabba the Hutt

Jabba the Hutt is a fictional character appearing in George Lucas's space opera film saga "Star Wars". He is depicted as a large, slug-like alien. His appearance has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as "Dickensian", a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat.
In the original theatrical releases of the original "Star Wars" trilogy, Jabba the Hutt first appeared in (1983), though he is mentioned in both ' (1977) and ' (1980), and a previously deleted scene involving Jabba the Hutt was added to the 1997 theatrical re-release and subsequent home media releases of "Star Wars". Jabba's role in "Star Wars" is primarily antagonistic; he is introduced as the crime boss who has a bounty on Han Solo's head. He is about 600 years old, a Hutt crime lord and gangster who employs a retinue of criminals, bounty hunters, smugglers, assassins and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire. In his palace on the desert planet Tatooine, he keeps a host of entertainers at his disposal: slaves, droids and alien creatures. Jabba has a grim sense of humour, an insatiable appetite, and affinities for gambling, slave girls and torture.
The character was incorporated into the "Star Wars" merchandising campaign that corresponded with the theatrical release of "Return of the Jedi". Besides the films, Jabba the Hutt is featured in "Star Wars" literature and is sometimes referenced by his full name, Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Jabba the Hutt's image has since played an influential role in popular culture, particularly in the United States. The name is used as a satirical literary device and a political caricature to underscore negative qualities such as morbid obesity and corruption.
Appearances.
Jabba the Hutt appears in three of the six live-action "Star Wars" films and "". He has a recurring role in Expanded Universe literature and is the protagonist of the comic book anthology "Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal" (1998), a collection of comics originally published in 1995 and 1996.
"Star Wars" films.
Jabba is first mentioned in "" (1977), but is introduced on screen in 1983 with the third installment of the original "Star Wars" trilogy, "Return of the Jedi". Directed by Richard Marquand and written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, the first act of "Return of the Jedi" features the attempts of Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), the Wookiee Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to rescue their friend, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who had been imprisoned in carbonite in the events of the previous film, "The Empire Strikes Back".
The captured Han is delivered to Jabba by the bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) and placed on display in the crime lord's throne room. Friends of Han, namely, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Leia, and Chewbacca infiltrate Jabba's palace as part of a plot to save Han. Leia herself is soon captured and enslaved by the Hutt. Luke arrives to "bargain for Solo's life". Luke, however, is dropped into the pit of the monstrous rancor, just below Jabba's throne room. After Luke slays the beast, Jabba condemns Luke, Han, and Chewbacca to a slow death in the belly of the Sarlacc, a large alien creature in Tatooine's Dune Sea. The execution turns into a skirmish at the Great Pit of Carkoon where Luke escapes execution with the help of R2-D2 and defeats Jabba's guards. During the subsequent confusion, Leia strangles Jabba to death with her slave chains. Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 escape just before Jabba's sail barge explodes, killing all inside.
The second film appearance of Jabba the Hutt is in the of "A New Hope" which was released in 1997 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original "Star Wars". Han Solo has a confrontation in a Mos Eisley cantina with the alien bounty hunter Greedo (Paul Blake and Maria De Aragon) that ends with the latter's death. According to Greedo, Jabba "has no use for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser." Jabba had hired Han to smuggle the illicit drug spice from the asteroid Kessel. Han, however, was forced to dump his cargo when an Imperial search team boarded the "Millennium Falcon", Han's ship. Greedo tells Han, "Jabba's put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you." In a scene that had been cut from the 1977 original, Jabba and an entourage of bounty hunters are seen in a hangar bay outside the "Millennium Falcon", trying to find the smuggler. Jabba confirms Greedo's last words and demands that Han pay the value of the shipment. Han promises to compensate Jabba as soon as he receives payment for delivering "goods"—Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and C-3PO—to Alderaan. Jabba warns Han that if he is not paid back soon, he will post a bounty "so big, you won't be able to go near a civilized system." However, Han never completes his deal with the Hutt. This was actually taken from an unfinished scene for the original 1977 version of the film, in which Jabba was played by Declan Mulholland. In the 1997 Special Edition version of the film, a CGI rendering of Jabba replaces Mulholland, and his voice is redubbed in Huttese.
Jabba the Hutt makes his third film appearance in the 1999 prequel, "". The character's scene is minor and has little to do with the plot of the film. During the Boonta Eve Classic podrace at Mos Espa on Tatooine, in which nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) wins his freedom, Jabba the Hutt is featured in his grandstand accompanied by Gardulla the Hutt (a feminine Hutt) and his Twi'lek majordomo Bib Fortuna (Matthew Wood). Although he is the host of the race, Jabba is totally uninterested and even dozes off, missing the race's conclusion.
Jabba makes his fourth and final appearance in "". In this 2008 film, Jabba the Hutt's son, Rotta, is captured by Separatists in an attempt to frame the Jedi and the Republic. Anakin Skywalker and his padawan Ahsoka Tano save Rotta and return him to Jabba, securing permission for the safe passage of Republic ships through his territory. Other than the movie, Jabba has also appeared in three episodes of the third season of the Clone Wars TV series. He appeared in the episode "Sphere of Influence" where his son Rotta also makes an appearance. Jabba is faced by Chairman Papanoida, whose daughters were kidnapped by one of his bounty hunters, Greedo. Jabba allows a sample of Greedo's blood to be taken in order to prove that he is the kidnapper, but Greedo's cowardliness speaks first. In the episode "Evil Plans" Jabba hires the bounty hunter Cad Bane to bring him plans for the Senate building. When Bane returns successful, Jabba not only pays him, but also hires him for another task. He and the Hutt Council send Bane to free his uncle Ziro the Hutt from prison (rather unexpected since Ziro helped kidnap his son.) Jabba makes one short appearance in the episode "Hunt for Ziro" in which he is seen laughing with amusement hearing of Ziro's death at the hand of Sy Snootles, and pays her for delivering Ziro's holo-diary. Jabba makes his final appearance in the show in the fifth season's episode "Eminence". He and the Hutt Council are approached by Darth Maul, Savage Opress, and Pre Vizsla, the leaders or the Shadow Collective. Jabba is in hologram form on Nal Hutta when Maul attempts to negotiate, stating they had no credits to pay the Hutts, and threatened their lives if they didn't join. Jabba of course sends bounty hunters Embo, Sugi, Latts Razzi and Dengar after the Sith and Mandalorian. This results in a battle in the palace, where the Hutt lords except one evacuate, but that Hutt is executed by Savage for being unable to give any useful information. The Shadow Collective later confronts Jabba at his palace, and Jabba is amused by Maul's persistence and agrees to an alliance.
"Star Wars" literature.
The first appearances of Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars Expanded Universe literature was in Marvel Comics' adaptations of "A New Hope". In "Six Against the Galaxy" (1977) by Roy Thomas, "What Ever Happened to Jabba the Hut?" (1979) and "In Mortal Combat" (1980), both by Archie Goodwin, Jabba the Hutt (originally spelled "Hut") appeared as a tall humanoid with a walrus-like face, a topknot, and a bright uniform. The official "Jabba" was not yet established as he had yet to be seen.
While awaiting the sequel to "Star Wars", Marvel kept the monthly comic going with their own stories, one of which includes Jabba tracking Han Solo and Chewbacca down to an old hideaway they use for smuggling. However, circumstances force Jabba to lift the bounty on Solo and Chewbacca, thus enabling them to return to Tatooine for an adventure with Luke Skywalker—who has returned to the planet in order to recruit more pilots for the Rebel Alliance. In the course of another adventure, Solo kills the space pirate Crimson Jack and busts up his operation, which Jabba bankrolled. Jabba thus renews the reward for Solo's head and Solo later kills a bounty hunter who tells him why he is hunted once more. He and Chewbacca return to the rebels. (Solo mentions an incident with a "bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell" in the opening scenes of "The Empire Strikes Back".)
The Marvel artists based Jabba on a character later named Mosep Binneed, an alien visible only briefly in the Mos Eisley cantina scene of "A New Hope". The 1977 mass market paperback of Lucas's "Star Wars" script describes Jabba as a "great mobile tub of muscle and suet topped by a shaggy scarred skull", but gives no further detail as to the character's physical appearance or species.
Later Expanded Universe novels and comics adopt the character's image as seen in the film. They also elaborate on his background prior to the events of the "Star Wars" films. For example, "Zorba the Hutt's Revenge" (1992), a young adult novel by Paul and Hollace Davids, reveals that Jabba's father is a powerful crime lord named Zorba the Hutt and that Jabba was born 596 years before the events of "A New Hope", making him around 600 years old at the time of his death in "Return of the Jedi". Ann C. Crispin's novel "The Hutt Gambit" (1997) explains how Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo become business associates and portrays the events that lead to a bounty being placed on Han's head. Other Expanded Universe stories—especially the anthology of Dark Horse comics by Jim Woodring titled "Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal" (1998)—likewise detail Jabba the Hutt's rise to the head of the Desilijic clan, his role in the criminal underworld of the "Star Wars" universe, and the establishment of his crime syndicate on Tatooine in the "Star Wars" galaxy's Outer Rim Territories.
"Tales From Jabba's Palace" (1996), a collection of short stories edited by science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson, pieces together the lives of Jabba the Hutt's various minions in his palace and their relationship to him during the last days of his life. The stories reveal that few of the Hutt's servants are loyal to him and most are in fact plotting to have him assassinated. When Jabba the Hutt is killed in "Return of the Jedi", his surviving former courtiers join forces with his rivals on Tatooine and his family on the Hutt homeworld Nal Hutta make claims to his palace, fortune, and criminal empire. Timothy Zahn's novel "Heir to the Empire" (1991) reveals that a smuggler named Talon Karrde eventually replaces Jabba as the "big fish in the pond", and moves the headquarters of the Hutt's criminal empire off Tatooine.
Characterization.
Jabba the Hutt exemplifies lust, greed, and gluttony. The character is known throughout the "Star Wars" universe as a "vile gangster" who amuses himself by torturing and humiliating his subjects and enemies. He surrounds himself with scantily-clad slave girls of all species, chaining many of them to his dais. The Star Wars Databank—an official online database of "Star Wars" information—remarks that residents of his palace are not safe from his desire to dominate and torture. Jabba would send even his most loyal servants and prized possessions to their deaths. For example, in "Return of the Jedi", the Twi'lek slave dancer Oola is fed to the rancor monster because she refuses to pander to his whim.
Jabba the Hutt's physical appearance is as grotesque as his character and reinforces his personality as a criminal deviant. As Han Solo puts it in "Return of the Jedi", Jabba is a "slimy piece of worm-ridden filth." Film critic Roger Ebert describes him as "a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat", and astrophysicist and science fiction writer Jeanne Cavelos gives Jabba the "award for most disgusting alien." Science fiction authors Tom and Martha Veitch write that Jabba's body is a "miasmic mass" of flesh that shakes as he laughs. He emits an unmistakable smell: "The Hutt's lardaceous body seemed to periodically release a greasy discharge, sending fresh waves of rotten stench" into the air. His swollen tongue drips with saliva as he feeds on creatures that resemble frogs and maggots. Jabba's appetite is insatiable and he is not discriminatory about his diet. For example, his jester, the Kowakian monkey-lizard Salacious B. Crumb, must make the Hutt crime lord laugh once a day, every day, or Jabba will eat him.
However, Jabba the Hutt does show rare moments of charity. For instance, in one Expanded Universe story, he prevents a Chevin named Ephant Mon from freezing to death on an ice planet by covering him with his bloated layers of fat; the two are eventually rescued, and Ephant Mon becomes totally loyal to the crime lord, making him the only resident of Jabba's palace that the crime lord trusts. Also, in "Star Wars: The Clone Wars", Jabba seems to have genuine affection for his son Rotta, and is worried by his kidnapping and angered by his supposed death.
Lucas has noted that there was a potential role for Jabba in future episodes, as he may have faked his death via Leia and one angle shows an escape hatch emerging from his barge as it explodes.
Concept and creation.
Jabba the Hutt's appearance underwent several changes between different versions of the films. The shift in the concept of Jabba the Hutt from a furry creature to a slug and from a puppet to CGI represent two of the more glaring changes to the character in the concept and creation process.
"Episode IV: A New Hope".
The original script to "A New Hope" describes Jabba as a "fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth", but Lucas stated in an interview that the initial character he had in mind was much furrier and resembled a Wookiee. When filming the scene between Han Solo and Jabba in 1976, Lucas employed Northern Irish actor Declan Mulholland to play the stand-in and read Jabba the Hutt's lines wearing a shaggy brown suit. Lucas planned to replace Mulholland in post-production with a stop-motion creature. The scene was meant to connect "A New Hope" to "Return of the Jedi" and explain why Han Solo was imprisoned at the end of "The Empire Strikes Back". Nevertheless, Lucas decided to leave the scene out of the final film on account of budget and time constraints and because he felt that it did not enhance the film's plot. The scene remained in the novelization, comic book, and radio adaptations of the film.
Lucas revisited the scene in the 1997 Special Edition release of "A New Hope", restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.
At one point of the original scene, Ford walks behind Mulholland. This became a problem when adding the CGI Jabba, since he had a tail that happened to be in the way. Eventually, this problem was solved by having Han stepping on Jabba's tail, causing the Hutt to react with a yelp of pain.
Lucas confesses that some people were upset about the CGI Jabba's appearance, complaining that the character "looked fake". Lucas dismisses this, stating that whether a character is portrayed as a puppet or as CGI, it will always be "fake" since the character is not real. He says he sees no difference between a puppet made of latex and one generated by a computer.
"Episode VI: Return of the Jedi".
Lucas based the CGI on the character as he originally appeared in "Return of the Jedi". In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." According to the 1985 documentary "From Star Wars to Jedi", Lucas rejected initial designs of the character. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop (Marius Rossillon) cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum, the "Michelin Man." "Return of the Jedi" costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him as some kind of slug, almost like in "Alice in Wonderland". At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to."
Production and design.
Designed by visual effects artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was inspired by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent "Star Wars" fiction.
In "Return of the Jedi", Jabba is portrayed by a one-ton puppet that took three months and half a million dollars to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet required three puppeteers to operate, making it one of the largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control.
Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's appearance and immobility, complaining that the puppet had to be moved around the set to film different scenes. In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of "Return of the Jedi", Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of "A New Hope".
Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but his lines are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language dialogue were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, whose work is not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany the movement of the puppet's limbs and mouth.
Jabba the Hutt's musical theme throughout the film, composed by John Williams, is played on a tuba. One reviewer of "Return of the Jedi"'s soundtrack comments, "Among the new thematic ideas the score is Jabba the Hutt's cute tuba piece (playing along the politically incorrect lines of tubas representing fatness) ..." The theme is very similar to one Williams wrote for a heavyset character in "Fitzwilly" (1967), though the theme does not appear on that film's soundtrack album. Williams later turned the theme into a symphonic piece performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz. The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by musicologists such as Gerald Sloan, who says Williams' piece "blends the monstrous and the lyrical."
According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt's death in "Return of the Jedi" was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. Lucas decided Leia should strangle him with her slave chain. He was inspired by a scene from "The Godfather" (1972) where an obese character named Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) is garroted by an assassin.
Portrayal.
Jabba the Hutt was played by Declan Mulholland in scenes cut from the 1977 release of '. In Mulholland's scenes as Jabba, Jabba is represented as a rotund Human dressed in a shaggy fur coat. George Lucas has stated his intention was to use an alien creature for Jabba, but the special effects technology of the time was not up to the task of replacing Mulholland. In 1997, the "Special Edition" re-releases restored and altered the original scene to include a computer generated portrayal of Jabba. In ', he was played by puppeteers Mike Edmonds, Toby Philpott, David Alan Barclay and voiced by Larry Ward. Jabba is played by an uncredited voice-actor in ' and in the ending credits, Jabba is credited as playing himself. His puppeteers have appeared in the documentaries ' and '. David Alan Barclay, who was one of the puppeteers for Jabba in the film, voiced Jabba in the Super Nintendo video game version of '. In the radio drama adaption of the original trilogy, Jabba is played by Ed Asner. In the film ' and the following , Jabba is portrayed by Kevin Michael Richardson. All other video game appearances of Jabba were played by Clint Bajakian. Jabba was supposed to appear in ', but was left out due to time constraints. A cutscene was produced featuring a conversation between Jabba and Juno Eclipse (voiced by Natalie Cox), which was scrapped from the game. He appears in the Ultimate Sith Edition.
Cultural impact.
With the premiere of "Return of Jedi" in 1983 and the accompanying merchandising campaign, Jabba the Hutt became an icon in American popular culture. The character was produced and marketed as a series of action figure play sets by Kenner/Hasbro from 1983 to 2004. In the 1990s, Jabba the Hutt became the protagonist in his own comic book series collectively titled "Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal". 
Jabba's role in popular culture extends beyond the "Star Wars" universe and its fans. In Mel Brooks' "Star Wars" spoof "Spaceballs" (1987), Jabba the Hutt is parodied as the character Pizza the Hutt, a cheesy blob shaped like a slice of pizza whose name is a double pun on Jabba the Hutt and the restaurant franchise Pizza Hut. Like Jabba, Pizza the Hutt is a loan shark and mobster. The character meets his demise at the end of "Spaceballs" when he becomes "locked in his car and himself to death." The Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., included a display on Jabba the Hutt in the temporary exhibition "Star Wars: The Magic of Myth", which closed in 1999. Jabba's display was called "The Hero's Return," referencing Luke Skywalker's journey toward becoming a Jedi.
Mass media.
Since the release of "Return of the Jedi", the name "Jabba the Hutt" has become synonymous in American mass media with repulsive obesity and corruption. The name is frequently utilized as a literary device—either as a simile or metaphor—to illustrate character flaws. For example, in "Under the Duvet" (2001), Marian Keyes references a problem with gluttony when she writes, "wheel out the birthday cake, I feel a Jabba the Hutt moment coming on." Likewise, in the novel "Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family" (2000), Laura Kalpakian uses Jabba the Hutt to emphasize the weight of a character's father: "The girls used to call Janice's parents Jabba the Hutt and the Wookiee. But then Jabba (Janice's father) died, and it didn't seem right to speak of the dead on those terms." In Dan Brown's first novel "Digital Fortress", an NSA technician is affectionately nicknamed Jabba the Hutt.
In his book of humor and popular culture "The Dharma of Star Wars" (2005), writer Matthew Bortolin attempts to show similarities between Buddhist teachings and aspects of "Star Wars" fiction. Bartolin insists that if a person makes decisions that Jabba the Hutt would make, then that person is not practicing the proper spiritual concept of dharma. Bortolin's book reinforces the idea that Jabba's name is synonymous with negativity:
One way to see if we are practicing right livelihood is to compare our trade with that of Jabba the Hutt. Jabba has his fat, stubby fingers in many of the pots that led to the dark side. He dealt largely in illegal "spice" trade—an illicit drug in the Star Wars galaxy. He also transacts business in the slave trade. He has many slaves himself, and some he fed to the Rancor, a creature he kept caged and tormented in his dungeon. Jabba uses deception and violence to maintain his position.
Outside literature, the character's name has become an insulting term of disparagement. To say that someone "looks like Jabba the Hutt" is commonly understood as a slur to impugn that person's weight and/or appearance. The term is often employed by the media as an attack on prominent figures. For instance, actress and comedian Roseanne endured what W. C. Goodman called "vitriolic attacks based on her weight" at the hands of "The New York Observer" columnist Michael Thomas who often compared her with ""Star Wars" blob monster" Jabba the Hutt. In "Starvin' Marvin in Space", a 1999 episode of the animated television series "South Park", Christian Children's Fund spokeswoman Sally Struthers is portrayed as the Hutt and accused of gorging herself on food relief meant for starving Ethiopians. Another reference appears in the "Family Guy" episode "He's Too Sexy for His Fat" when Peter mentions his husky ancestor Jabba the Griffin.
In another sense of the term, Jabba the Hutt has come to represent greed and anarchy, especially in the business world. For instance, Michael Jordan biographer Mitchell Krugel uses the term to disparage Chicago Bulls's general manager Jerry Krause after Krause made a comment about Jordan and other players' multi-million dollar contracts: "Krause added to his Jabba the Hutt image during the media gathering that preceded the opening of camp when he answered a question about the prospect of rebuilding the Bulls without Phil or Michael in the imminent future by saying, 'Organizations win championships. Players and coaches are parts of organizations'." Jabba the Hutt ranked #4 on the Forbes Fictional 15 list of wealthiest fictional characters in 2008.
Jabba the Hutt has likewise become a popular means of caricature in American politics. For example, opponents of California Democratic legislator Jackie Goldberg commonly depict the politician as the "Star Wars" character. The "Los Angeles Daily News" has caricatured her in cartoons as a grotesquely overweight Jabba the Hutt-like figure and the "New Times LA" referred to Goldberg as "a human Jabba the Hutt who consumes the good while producing the bad." William G. Ouchi uses the term to describe what he sees as the inefficient bureaucracy of the public school system: "With all of these unnecessary layers of organizational fat, school districts have come to resemble Jabba the Hutt—the pirate leader in "Star Wars"."

1987 was Hayward's best minor league season since his professional rookie year. In 23 games (22 starts), he went 8-5 with a 3.10 ERA. In 142 innings, he struck out 115 batters. So impressive it was in fact that the Padres recalled him, and on June 10 he made his first big league appearance of the 1987 season. Over the span of a couple of weeks, he'd make four relief appearances, going 0-0 with a 16.50 ERA. In his first game back, he allowed six runs in an inning of work.
1988.
On February 12, 1988, Hayward was traded with Rich Gossage to the Chicago Cubs for Keith Moreland and Mike Brumley. He was again traded on March 17, this time to the Rangers for Dave Meier and Greg Tabor. 
Pitching for the Oklahoma City 89ers, Hayward went 3-2 with a 3.86 ERA in eight games. He earned an extended stay with the Rangers that season, starting 12 games and going 4-6 with a 5.46 ERA. Hayward pitched in his final big league game on July 5, 1988.
1989.
Although he would not play in the majors after 1988, he did continue to pitch in the minor leagues. Hayward did not play in 1989, however.
1990.
He pitched for the 89ers in 1990, Hayward went 5-9 with a 5.16 ERA in 89 innings.
1991.
1991 was Hayward's final professional season. He pitched for both the Tulsa Drillers and the 89ers, going a combined 3-6 with a 4.72 ERA in 76 innings.
Major league totals.
Overall, Hayward went 4-8 with a 6.75 ERA, one complete game and one shutout in 19 games (15 starts). In 78 innings of work, he allowed 10 home runs and 42 walks, and he struck out 45 batters.

United States Senate election in Delaware, 1972

The United States Senate election in Delaware, 1972 was held on November 7, 1972. Incumbent Republican United States Senator J. Caleb Boggs ran for a third term in the United States Senate. Boggs faced off against Joe Biden, a New Castle County Councilman. Though Senator Boggs was expected to easily win a third term over the then-unknown Biden, it ended up being the closest Senate election in 1972, and Biden narrowly beat out Boggs by a little over three thousand votes, winning what would be his first of seven terms.
General election.
Campaign.
Longtime Delaware political figure and Republican incumbent Senator J. Caleb Boggs was considering retirement, which would likely have left U.S. Representative Pete du Pont and Wilmington Mayor Harry G. Haskell, Jr. in a divisive primary fight. To avoid that, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support.
No other Democrat wanted to run against Boggs besides Biden, a New Castle County Councilman. Biden's campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning. It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who would go on to manage his future campaigns as well) and staffed by other members of his family, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers. Biden did receive some assistance from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell. Biden's campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public's dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and "change".
During the summer Biden trailed by almost 30 percentage points, but his energy level, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters' emotions gave the surging Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs. Biden won the November 7, 1972 election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes.
At the time of the election Biden was a little less than 30 years old; age 30 is a constitutional requirement for the U.S. Senate, and he reached that on November 20, in time for the Senate term beginning January 3. After his election he became the sixth-youngest Senator in history.

King of the Hill (board game)

King of the Hill is a race game, where players try to be the first to get their marbles from the start to the top of the mountain. It was originally published by Schaper Toys in 1960 and was recently republished with slightly different rules by Winning Moves Games USA in 2006.
Gameplay (1960).
In the original Schaper game, players took turns moving marbles up a 3-D Mountain shaped board. Each turn, a player would use an hourglass-shaped teeter-totter device to determine the amount of spaces they could move that turn. They would then pick one of their marbles and move it along the board's path that number of spaces. If the marble ends its move on a space where another marble is, it continues along to the next open space. If the marble lands on a hole space, they drop their marble into the hole, where it comes out lower on the board. If they managed to get their marble to the top of the mountain, they would drop it into a hole in the middle. This could trigger a crown to pop up and the player would win. If not, the player would start their marble back on the track.
Gameplay (2006).
The newer version has slightly different rules and a much different look. The board now features a large crater in the center instead of a mountain and the board track winds around the crater, running along aside the crater at roughly the halfway point and end of the track. Also gone are the holes in the track. Instead, players with a marble on the track next to the crater are dropped into the crater of another player ends their turn on them. A marble dropped into the crater this way comes out of one of three "caves" on corners of the board and is then placed back on the track on one of the spaces next to the "cave." Additionally, the end game is totally different. Instead of the mechanized crown, players instead try to be the first to get both their marbles into the "Finish Zone."

County court bailiff

County court bailiffs are employees of Her Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service and are responsible for enforcing orders of county courts by recovering money owed under county court judgments. They can seize and sell goods to recover the amount of the debt. They can also serve court documents and effect and supervise the possession of property and the return of goods under hire purchase agreements. 
Entry.
A county court bailiff can enter a premises to seize goods and sell these at public auction, they can enter a property through an open door or window (front and back) and can climb over fences and gates, but cannot break them down. If the bailiff has entry previously (made a levy) or has been forcefully removed they can then use reasonable force to gain re-entry to inspect the goods or remove them.
When determining the value of goods to be seized, it is the likely price that the goods will reach at auction that is pertinent, not what was paid for them.
Police assistance.
Section 85(4) of the County Courts Act 1984 states: "It shall be the duty of every constable within his jurisdiction to assist in the execution of every such warrant." This is rarely used and if the police are called they will generally be there to prevent a breach of the peace.
Penalty for assaulting county court bailiffs.
Section 14 of the County Court Act 1984 gives the following penalty:
"If any person assaults an officer of a court while in the execution of his duty, he shall be liable—
Debtors vehicle.
A debtors vehicle can be immobilised or removed and goods can be taken up to the value of outstanding judgment plus additional bailiff/removal/auction house fees. Vehicles may be immobilised/removed on both private or public land.
Arrest warrant.
County court bailiffs execute arrest warrants to secure attendance to court or committal proceedings (contempt of court etc.).

Beat'n Groovy

"Beat'n Groovy" is a music video game distributed over Xbox Live Arcade. It was released on October 8, 2008. The game is based on "Pop'n Music", a similarly styled arcade/PlayStation 2 game series that has not been released officially outside of Japan.
Gameplay.
As scrolling notes scroll down the screen, the player is to press the corresponding button on the controller, which plays a keysound which fills in part of the selected song. Players are judged on the accuracy of their hits, and a life bar on the side of the screen increases or decreases depending on their performance. The life bar must be at or over 60% at the end of the song in order to pass. The game features nine songs (ranked on a difficulty level of 1 to 9, although the hardest song is only a 3), and seven playable characters. 3-key and 5-key modes are available, with online multiplayer modes using 3-key only. An additional play mode using the Xbox Live Vision camera is also available.
Reception.
IGN's Hilary Goldstien gave "Beat'n Groovy" a 2.0/10, critiquing the game as "poorly designed and poorly executed", and dubbing the song list as being "horrendous".

Charles Dawson Booker

Major Charles Dawson Booker DSC (sometimes hyphenated into Dawson-Booker) (21 April 1897 – 13 August 1918) was a World War I fighter ace credited with 29 victories. He was promoted to high rank while relatively young as a result of his gallantry and unswerving dedication to his country.
Early life.
Charles Dawson Booker was born to Joseph Dawson and Rachel C. Booker at Burnt House Cottage, Speldhurst, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. He spent part of his youth in Australia, attending the Grammar School in Melbourne from February 1908 through December 1911. He then returned to England and attended Bedford School until May 1915. On 8 September 1915, he was accepted into the Royal Naval Air Service as a Flight Sub-Lieutenant.
First Tour of Service.
He served on the Belgian Coast, first with 5 Naval Wing, then with 8 Naval Squadron from May through October 1916, and further inland for another year, through November 1917. He did not open his victory roll until 23 January 1917, after his transfer to 8 Naval, when he drove an Albatros D.III down out of control while piloting a Sopwith Pup.
After a lapse of some months, he used a Sopwith Triplane to score four times in April, becoming an ace on the 30th. Even at this early stage, he was flight commander of C Flight despite his youth. He was described by one of his wingmen as "...a little fellow, usually very silent, who fears nothing, but he would run a mile from any girl...he hopes the war will go on forever because he loves air fighting, and if the war were to end he is afraid he might not be able to find a suitable job."
May was an especially notable month for Booker, with nine victories, including a triple on the 24th.
On 22 June, after his 17th win, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross; the citation noted his three wins tallied on 24 May.
After three victories in July, he shot down and badly wounded German ace Hauptmann Adolf Ritter von Tutschek, commander of Jasta 12, on 11 August 1917; Tutschek would take half a year to recover. In this same fight, Booker was so badly shot about that German ace Viktor Schobinger claimed Booker as a victory. Booker actually managed to coax his destroyed 'Tripehound' to a forced landing in friendly territory. He had used Sopwith Triplanes (his usual aircraft being serial number N5482, which he whimsically dubbed 'Maude') to run his string of triumphs to 23 by this time. The crash landing on the 11th was the end of 'Maude'. It had been his mount for at least 14 triumphs.
On 27 September, he scored his first victory while flying a Sopwith Camel; he shot down German ace Oberleutnant Hans Waldhausen of Jasta 37, who became a prisoner.
However, Naval 8, and Booker, were withdrawn from action in November and returned to England. Booker was the fourth ranked of the 25 aces in this prestigious squadron.
Second Tour of Service.
After some months back in England, he returned to France as a Major commanding 201 Squadron of the newly formed Royal Air Force. He had been given the command in March, just shy of his 21st birthday. Once again, he would be flying a Camel.
He led 201 by example, scoring two May victories and one in July. In May, on the 24th, he identified the body of his friend, Australian ace Robert Little, who had been shot down nearby.
On 13 August 1918, he was leading a rookie pilot on an orientation tour of their aerial battlefield. The two Camel pilots ran into a formation of at least six expert pilots from Jagdgeschwader II. Booker tackled them single-handedly to cover the green pilot's retreat. It was the greenhorn who verified Booker's final three wins. However, Jasta 12's ace Leutnant Ulrich Neckel finally shot Booker down.
Booker was buried in Vignacourt British Cemetery, Somme, France.
He had claimed 29 victories; he shared in the capture of two enemy airplanes; destroyed ten, including six victories shared with other pilots; and drove down 17 'out of control', including five shared wins.
Citation.
Distinguished Service Cross
Charles Dawson Booker was also awarded the "Croix de guerre" on 14 July 1917.

Tulle gras (French, "oily tulle") or tulle gras dressing is a type of bandage commonly used in France, although the term is also used in English. It consists of fabric impregnated with soft paraffin oil (98 parts), balsam of Peru (1 part), and olive oil (1 part), which prevents its sticking to wounds, but means that it needs to be used in combination with another absorbent dressing.

Ellen Hambro

Ellen Christine Hambro (born 20 July 1964) is a Norwegian civil servant.
Early career.
Hambro earned a law degree (cand.jur.) from the University of Oslo in 1991. She joined the Ministry of the Environment the same year and in 1997 became head of her department, where she worked on waste management issues. Norway's industrial employers credited her with raising the percentage of waste recycled from almost nothing to about 70%. In 2004 she moved to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, where she worked as deputy under-secretary of state.
Directorship.
Since 1 January 2007 she has directed Norway's Climate and Pollution Agency (before 2010, called the Pollution Control Authority). She is the first woman to hold the post. Green Warriors of Norway expressed approval of her appointment.
During Hambro's directorship, SFT imposed a fine of on Autoretur, which was in charge of handling car wrecks. Hambro cited the company's inadequate return system, and warned of another fine if this was not remedied. In an interview with "Teknisk Ukeblad", Hambro admitted mistakes by the Pollution Authority before and after the Vest Tank explosion in Gulen, May 24, 2007. She said that the pollution authority ought to be better at investigating possible breaches of safety regulations, and that they could have offered better information to the Gulen community. She was also highly critical of the Vest Tank company, accusing them of lying and illegal waste management. Vest Tank responded by suing her for defamation. Hambro was sceptical of the merger between Statoil and the oil and gas division of Norsk Hydro, stating that the companies would no longer need to compete on being environmentally friendly. She was also critical of StatoilHydro's application to increase emissions at their LNG plant at Meløya in Hammerfest.
In 2013 her agency was merged to form the Norwegian Environment Agency. She continued as director.
Private life.
Hambro is the grand-daughter of right-wing politician Carl Joachim Hambro, and is a member of the family that established Hambros Bank, which for many years was the sole banker to Norway and the other Scandinavian kingdoms. She lives in Oslo, and has two daughters, Sara Hambro and Frida Hambro Angell.

Birmingham International Raceway

Birmingham International Raceway, (BIR) (formerly Fairgrounds Raceway, Birmingham Super Speedway, Birmingham Super Raceway and Birmingham International Speedway) was a 5/8-mile oval paved racetrack located at the Alabama State Fairgrounds in the Five Points West neighborhood of Birmingham, Alabama. It was used primarily for late-model automobile racing. 
History.
The original one-mile dirt oval was built as a horse track. On October 7, 1906 the track hosted its first motorcycle race, followed by an automobile race three days later. These events continued regularly through 1917. A 10,000-seat grandstand was built in 1925.
In 1932 the oval was reduced to a half-mile circuit. The smaller configuration was used until July 4, 1942, when it closed for World War II. It was reopened on October 1, 1946, and began hosting weekly auto-racing events organized by promoter J. P. Rotton.
A quarter-mile dirt oval was added in 1958 and was the first track to be paved, with the first events held on the new surface on July 15, 1960. After one season of racing on the quarter-mile track the present five-eighths-mile course was constructed with its first race held on June 28, 1962. With new lighting the Sunday afternoon races were moved to Friday nights.
Between 1958 and 1968 a total of eight NASCAR races were run at the Fairgrounds Raceway. During the same period Bobby Allison had moved to Hueytown from Miami, Florida and convinced his brother Donnie and fellow racer Red Farmer to join him in founding a new race shop. The so-called "Alabama Gang" dominated the races at the Fairgrounds track, but other legends of the sport also recorded wins, including "Fireball" Roberts, Richard Petty, and Ned Jarrett.
Proposed move.
On June 19, 2008, Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford proposed a plan to move BIR from the Fairgrounds to city-owned property in northwest Birmingham. Langford said the track, which has been in continuous operation for over 80 years in Five Points West, needs to be upgraded, and does not fit into current plans for the renovation of Fair Park. Langford committed $1 million to the project, but stated that track officials would have to come up with the majority of the funds needed for the project.
After the 2008 race season, the track was shut down. On January 30, 2009, demolition of the grandstand began, and was completed two months later.
The site is now home to the Birmingham Crossplex, a natatorium and indoor track and field facility.

Baseball City Royals

The Baseball City Royals were a farm team for the Kansas City Royals from 1988 to 1992.
The Baseball City Royals (based in Davenport, FL) joined the Florida State League in 1988. Managed by Luis Silverio, the Kansas City Royals farm team had the FSL's second-best record that year at 79-60 but lost the first-half central division to the Osceola Astros by two games and the second-half race to the Lakeland Tigers by half a game. They were sixth in the 14-team league in attendance (63,746). Outscoring opponents just 557-545, the team had two All-Stars - catcher Carlos Escalera (.253/~.293/.345) and pitcher Aguedo Vasquez (3-2, 33 Sv, 1.67, 54 H in 80 IP). Vasquez led the FSL in saves and games pitched (62) and won the league's MVP award. Going on to fairly long and productive big league careers would be a sizeable contingent of Kevin Appier (10-9, 2.75), 1B-DH Jeff Conine (.272/~.345/.443), 3B Sean Berry (.234/~.309/.319, 24 SB) and 2B Brian McRae (.308/~.378/.355).
In 1989, the Royals had a worse overall record by one game (78-61) but won the first half in the central division (42-27). In the playoffs, they fell 2 games to 0 to the St. Petersburg Cardinals. The attendance plummeted to 39,220 (12th). Silverio's club led the FSL in offense (698 runs) while they allowed 615. They had no All-Stars that season. OF Pete Alborano (.337/~.385/.411) and C Jorge Pedre (.327/~.367/.500) provided excellent contact, while Escalera improved to .294/~.344/.417. Also returning were Berry (.266/~.339/.378, 37 SB) and Conine (.273/~.335/.433, 32 SB, a team-high 14 HR and 91 K). Dazzling on the hill were Carlos Maldonado (11-3, 9 Sv, 1.17, 47 H in 77 IP) and Dennis Moeller (9-0, 1.77).
Brian Poldberg became manager in 1990 and the team fell to 60-78 while they drew a league-low 18,884. Outscored 675-542, the club had few bright spots. A few bright spots were Mark Parnell (2-2, 17 Sv, 1.86, 24 H, 40 K in 39 IP) and Greg Harvey (5-1, 2.04, 27 H in 40 IP) on the mound. OF Jacob Brumfield overcame a release in spring training and won the batting title at .366/.429/.417. He also paced the FSL in OBP and stole 47 bases in 57 attempts. He made the league's All-Star team.
The 1991 Baseball City team had a 446-461 run margin and the Carlos Tosca-managed nine went 62-69. At 35-30 in the second half, they were one game behind Lakeland in the Central. Doug Harris (10-6, 2.47) finished ninth in ERA for the All-Star-less team. OF Kerwin Moore (.210/~.319/.322) led the FSL in steals (61) and strikeouts (141) while the top offensive threat was 3B Phil Hiatt (.298/~.344/.451, 28 SB). Brian Ahern (7-2, 2.00) was effective in 13 starts, while the bullpen boasted fine production from Matt Karchner (6-3, 5 Sv, 1.97, 49 H in 73 IP), Tony Long (7-3, 10 Sv, 1.96) and Skip Wiley (4-2, 17 Sv, 1.68). They drew 21,174 fans, next-to-last in the FSL.
In 1992, the Royals were 71-60 and finished sixth under the guidance of Ron Johnson. Their attendance of 17,406 was second-lowest, but almost 40,000 less than the next team. Making the playoffs as a wild card, they stunned the favorite Sarasota White Sox 2 games to 0 then beat the Osceola Astros 2 games to 1, before falling to Lakeland 2 games to 0 in the finals. They had a 532-464 edge in runs. FSL managers selected C Lance Jennings (.259/~.317/.420) as the 8th-best prospect in the loop and he was their only All-Star, sharing FSL All-Star honors with Dunedin's Carlos Delgado.
1B Joe Vitiello (.283/~.357/.388) made the league's top 10 in average, while 3B Joe Randa hit .275/~.318/.328 in 51 contests. Long (3-3, Sv, 1.83) again pitched well, as did Kevin Kobetitsch (3-0, 4 Sv, 1.26, .78 WHIP). Jon Lieber (3-3, 4.65) made seven appearances en route to a fine MLB career.
In 1993, Kansas City moved their high class-A affiliate to the Wilmington Blue Rocks.

Russian Chapel, Vršič

The Russian Chapel at the Vršič Pass () is a Russian Orthodox memorial chapel located on the Vršič Pass road in northwestern Slovenia. It was built by Russian prisoners of war engaged in forced labor in the area during World War I.
History.
In early 1915, the small town of Kranjska Gora suddenly became strategically important due to its proximity to the Isonzo Front. To facilitate access from the town to the front, the Austro-Hungarian authorities ordered the construction of a military road across Vršič, a 1,611 m pass between the Sava and Soča valleys, to be built by Russian POWs.
The road was begun in May 1915, and was completed by the end of the year. To ensure an uninterrupted supply of materiel to the front lines, the pass was to be kept traversable year-round, and the POWs were made to clear the road of heavy snowfall. On 8 or 12 March 1916 (sources vary), an avalanche buried a POW work camp, killing approximately 300 prisoners and about 10 guards. Exact casualty figures were never determined, either for the victims of the avalanche of for those of the brutal overwork and appalling conditions. 
The Russian camp was located roughly halfway up the slope of Vršic. Between 1916 and 1917, the remaining prisoners built a small wooden memorial chapel. The building is of typical Russian design, with two small towers on either side of the nave, and is surrounded by prisoners' graves and a pyramid-shaped memorial marker to the immediate right of the chapel.
The site was renovated in 2005, at a cost of €90,000, and serves as both a war memorial and a symbolic link between Slovenia and Russia. The pass road was renamed "Ruska cesta" ('Russian Road') in July 2006.

From the Entrails to the Dirt

From the Entrails to the Dirt is a three-part vinyl set compiling songs by Malicious Secrets and three other French black metal acts: Antaeus, Mütiilation and Deathspell Omega. It was originally released by End All Life Productions as a set of three gatefold singles limited to 666 copies, with one Malicious Secrets track and one other band's part on each. The album was later reissued as a digipack CD.
Musical style.
Filip Dupont of "Archaic Magazine" described the music of Malicious Secrets as "pure chaos and junk […], divine for some – rubbish for the most". Nattskog of "Spirit of Metal Webzine" described the style as "very violent, very strange with completely barbarian vocals above music that isn't less ". The Antaeus track "Gates to the Outside" follows the chaotic and brutal style typical for the band. Nattskog described Mütiilation's cover of "My Way" as "in the style expected from Mütiilation: ailing, raw, depressive". Mütiilation's "Tears of a Melancholic Vampire" is a melancholic song, while the final track "Mass Grave Aesthetics" was described by Dupont as "dark, full of atmosphere and unique in its style".
Reviews.
Filip Dupont of "Archaic Magazine" called "From the Entrails to the Dirt" "pure cult in the deepest of the underground", considering Deathspell Omega's "Mass Grave Aesthetics" to be the best track and the one "that makes this 'From The Entrails To The Dirt' such a remarkable release". Nattskog of "Spirit of Metal Webzine" recommends the release to "adepts of a pure and frankly extreme black metal".

2009 Florida Marlins season

The Florida Marlins' 2009 season is the 17th season for the Major League Baseball franchise. The Marlins play their home games at Sun Life Stadium. Fredi González returns for his third straight season as manager. It was the third best season in Franchise History, and the best non-playoff season, 87-75
Regular season.
April.
Opening Day showcased the Marlins′ new emphasis on pitching and speed, although several home runs were hit too. New leadoff hitter Emilio Bonifacio had three stolen bases and an inside-the-park home run, going 4-for-5. A grand slam by Hanley Ramírez, and homers by Jorge Cantú and Jeremy Hermida capped a spectacular performance in a 12–6 win over the Washington Nationals. Following an opening series sweep of Washington, the Marlins won two of three games against the New York Mets. Next, Florida had a nine game road trip, visiting Atlanta, Washington, and Pittsburgh for three games each. The Marlins swept both the Braves and Nationals to earn a franchise-best 11–1 record to open a season. But then they stumbled in Pittsburgh, losing all three games to the Pirates. Then the Marlins returned home to meet the Phillies, and lost all three games there too. In the final game against Philadelphia, outfielder Cody Ross pitched an inning of relief, becoming the first Marlins position player to pitch since Jason Wood did so in 2007. The Marlins closed April with three straight wins on the road.
May.
The Marlins opened the month by losing the final three games of a four game series at the Chicago Cubs. This was the beginning of one of the worst months in Marlins history going 5-20. Ricky Nolasco never returned to his 2008 form and was sent down to AAA. Worse yet, their number three starter Aníbal Sánchez got injured and the Marlins experimented with different pitchers including John Koronka, Graham Taylor, and even tried starting relievers Hayden Penn and Burke Badenhop before finally settling for Sean West. For the second time in 2009 a position player, Ross Gload pitched a hitless 9th inning in a 15-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. After being 11-1 near the end of April they finish up May with a 23-28 record.
June.
In June the Marlins slowly were able to climb back to a 40-39 record. Rookie pitcher Sean West went into the 7th inning against his childhood idol Randy Johnson and the San Francisco Giants with a no-hitter before Edgar Rentería hit a single. and Ricky Nolasco returned from the Minors and was better than ever. Hanley Ramírez started to play like an MVP, by hitting 2 grand slams in one series against the Baltimore Orioles, his second and third of the year, then continued to have RBIs for 10 straight games into July 2 for a Florida Marlins franchise record.
July.
In the beginning of July Hanley Ramírez was voted as the starting shortstop for the National League in the 2009 MLB All-Star Game. Teammate and pitcher Josh Johnson joined him but was not named a starter. At the All-Star Game, Ramírez went 0 for 3 with 3 ground balls. Johnson did not get the opportunity to pitch. Coming out of the All-Star Break, the Marlins ran in the Philadelphia Phillies with a four game series. Since the 3rd game got rained out, they only lost all 3 games. No. 5 starter Sean West was sent to the minors and Rick VandenHurk was called up to make his 2009 Marlins debut. Also, their No. 4 starter Andrew Miller was sent down and Gaby Sánchez joined the team.

Yim Tin Tsai (Tai Po)

Yim Tin Tsai () is an island of Hong Kong located in Tolo Harbour.
Geography.
Yim Tin Tsai is located in Tolo Harbour and forms part of the southern border of Plover Cove. It is connected to the mainland in the north by a road, leading next to The Beverly Hills, and to the island of Ma Shi Chau in the east by a tombolo that is only accessible when the tide is low. Sam Mun Tsai New Village (三門仔新村) and Luen Yick Fishermen Village (聯益漁村) are located in the north of the island. The two villages are facing the Shuen Wan Typhoon Shelter (船灣避風塘).
While Yim Tin Tsai is not part of the Ma Shi Chau Special Area, a small unnamed island located about 100 m northeast of its shore belongs to the Area.
History.
A late Neolithic prehistoric site dating back to about 4,000 years ago has been identified on Yim Tin Tsai. Prehistoric sites have been discovered on two other islands of Tolo Harbour, namely Yuen Chau Tsai (3,000 years, Bronze Age) and Centre Island (6,000 years, mid-Neolithic Age).
Members of the Hakka Chan (陳) clan moved from today's Shenzhen and settled in Yim Tin Tsai during the 19th century. Other members of the clan settled in Yim Tin Tsai in Sai Kung and in Ping Yeung, in Ta Kwu Ling, North District. Salt fields were operated on Yim Tin Tsai at that time.
The fishermen now residing in Sam Mun Tsai New Village used to live on boats at the original Sam Mun Tsai, close to Tai Kau of Luk Heung, now at the northeastern shore of Plover Cove Reservoir. They were relocated to their current residence in 1966, as a result of the construction of the Plover Cove Reservoir. At the time, 36 families were moved to housing on land. Extensive renovation work was conducted at the village in 2006-2007.

Cimarrón Uruguayo

The Cimarrón Uruguayo (Uruguayan Cimarron) is a breed of molosser type dog originating in Uruguay. The word "cimarrón" in Latin America is used to mean "feral", referring to the breed's history.
Other names by which it is known in English are Cimarron, Cimarron Creole, Cimarron Dog, Maroon Dog, Cerro Largo Dog, Uruguayan Gaucho Dog, Perro Cimarron, possibly others. The breed is officially recognised in Uruguay and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale with the name "Cimarrón Uruguayo".
Appearance.
The Cimarrón Uruguayo is large in size, compact and muscular. The coat is short and usually brindle but may be a pale yellow ("bayo"), with a black face. Height of males at the withers is from 58 to 61 cm (23 to 24 in) and weight is from 38 to 45 kg (84 to 99 lb). Adult females are slightly smaller.
Temperament.
The breed standard states that the dog should have great courage. As with all large dogs, the Cimarrón Uruguayo must be well socialized when very young if it is to be safely kept as a companion.
The Cimarrón Uruguayo is used for guarding, hunting, and all dog sports in its native Uruguay.
History.
The Cimarrón Uruguayo descends from European dogs brought by early colonizers, and released or abandoned. The dogs adapted to living in the wild in Uruguay, and in time became numerous. In the eighteenth century, attacks on livestock and even humans resulted in the dogs being hunted, with bounties paid by the government for each dog killed. However, many remained, especially in the highlands of Cerro Largo. Ranchers in the area would capture and tame the dogs, using them as guard dogs.
The Cimarrón's survival story and fierceness has made it something of a national symbol in Uruguay, and the breed is the mascot of the National Army of Uruguay.
The Kennel Club Uruguayo (Uruguayan national kennel club) recognised the Cimarrón Uruguayo after some twenty years of work by fanciers and breeders in documenting the breed. In addition, genetic studies are being done on the breed by the Universidad de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay college of Veterinary Medicine.
The Cimarrón Uruguayo was provisionally recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale on February 21, 2006, in Group 2, Section 2 Molossoid breeds-Mastiff type.
The breed has been exported to the United States, and is recognised there by the United Kennel Club in the Guardian Dog Group.
Health.
The Cimarrón Uruguayo should be tested for hip and elbow dysplasia before breeding.
Often the ears are cropped short when the dogs are very young. This is alleged to be in homage to the days when they were hunted (the ears were presented for the bounty.) Most fighting dog breeds have their ears severely cropped.

Aliança da Terra

Aliança da Terra (AT) is a Civil Society Organization of Public Interest - OSCIP, formed by farmers, researchers and entrepreneurs in the agribusiness industry committed to uniting the sector by creating and strengthening of alliances that enable the concept of "Producing Right".
Alianca da Terra was formed in 2004 by John Carter, a rancher and pilot in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Since 1996, John and his family have been ranching in the Eastern Xingu and watching as the forest disappears, a victim of the development that has been the engine of Brazil’s recent economic renaissance.
Agriculture is now responsible for a quarter of Brazil’s gross domestic product, a measure of economic production, and looks to keep that share for the foreseeable future. With a planet of 7 billion people, and heading for 9 billion, compounded with the increasing consumption of protein in many parts of the world, Brazil will be called upon to feed the world. However, in the past two decades, Brazil’s remarkable turnaround has come at a high environmental and social cost. Inextricably linked to deforestation, human rights abuse and land speculation, the development of the Cerrado and Amazon share a common inspirational yet tragic history with all other economic frontiers, including the Western USA and Southern Brazil.
As an experienced pilot, John has flown back and forth over this region for more than 500,000 kilometers. As a local rancher, he has seen the destruction first hand while facing the economic reality of trying to make a living under these conditions. The bravery, ingenuity, perseverance and grace of people eking out a living on the frontier were equally matched by corruption, thievery, fear and extortion. After a decade fighting alone to keep a handhold in the whirlwind, John realized that the only solution would come from the people living the day to day of the frontier life. Collectively, the strength and character of the frontiersmen, and women, can overcome any hurdle – in this case, the hurdle of how to balance production and environmental protection in the face of entrenched economic drivers.
To harness the love of the land found in the heart of any farmer and balance agricultural production with environmental conservation, John, with the help of Daniel Nepstad of the Insituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazônia (IPAM) and Ocimar Villela from Grupo Maggi, founded Aliança da Terra in 2004. Aliança’s primary mission is to enable property owners to engage in and demonstrate good land stewardship and to protect the environment while fostering governance on the frontier. For the past eight years Aliança has steadily created a base of good land stewards in the Amazon, that includes ranchers, farmers, indigenous peoples and smallholders, and has laid the foundation for future ecosystem service markets. Through a Registry of Social-Environmental Responsibility (RSR), Aliança has developed the first true voluntary, producer-focused means of encouraging and demonstrating good land management. Coupled with its Voluntary Fire Brigade, founded in 2009, Aliança’s Registry is an important element in finding the balance between development and conservation.
RSR
Developed by Aliança da Terra, the Registry of Social-Environmental Responsibility - RSR - serves to support producers in the social and environmental management of their lands.
Joining forces with producers and other social and scientific partners, the RSR was created to identify, recognize and reward responsible producers, separating them from producers not concerned with sustainability. The RSR highlights producers that implement good land stewardship practices as well as those who seek to adopt such management methods. We have properties spread over all Brazilian territory in our Registry (Access the covered areas). Our goal is to register and work with more than 20 million hectares by 2017.
Through the RSR a detailed diagnostic is produced that describes the environmental and social conditions of the rural property. The performance of each property is analyzed using a set of key indicators:
Once completed, a property level score is produced and the landowner is presented with a list of action items to be completed. The landowner voluntarily commits to a recovery plan, based on his or her financial and management capacity. The landowner signs a Commitment Letter, which Aliança uses as a judge against future performance. Our goal is to encourage landowners to improve – we do not wish to punish or embarrass. Therefore we are flexible and encouraging of all improvements, however small. While we understand the benefit and need for absolute change and measuring quality, we believe in continual improvement to get there. Our approach, and the incredible commitment on the part of the producers in our system, is changing the face of agricultural production in Brazil.
The registry stresses economically viable production practices while obeying appropriate social-environmental standards. The RSR has the following objectives and benefits:
Because the RSR is voluntary, the investments of good land management are currently born mostly by the producer. We estimate that our members have invested more than 24 million R$ (approximately US $ 13 million) in environmental and social recovery between 2009 and 2011.
FIRE FIGHTING
In 2009 Aliança da Terra created its own Fire Brigade. This initiative's mission is to act directly in the fighting, as well as to raise awareness and educate local communities about the correct use of fire.
While common in rural USA, and other parts of the world, the concept of a coordinated volunteer fire brigade is alien to the Brazilian agricultural frontier. However, as three successful years in action have proved beyond doubt, there is the desire. In 2009 Aliança created and trained one 6-man fire fighting team. With this team, and with training and support of local fire brigades, support from the US Forest Service’s “Smoke-jumpers ” and the USFS International Program, and, most importantly, with joint support from the Corpo de Bombeiros, local landowners and Indigenous peoples, Aliança has laid the foundation for the first volunteer fire brigade in the Amazon, and created a sense of governance on the frontier, where the previous overriding sense had been “every man for himself”. This is an extraordinary change, showing that Aliança has tapped another vein of conscientious land stewardship, pent-up demand of self-help, and the frontier “can-do” spirit.
Fire is the common enemy of the producer, environmentalist, and indigenous people alike – it is also possibly the single most destructive force in the region and a massive hurdle for the creation of carbon markets and REDD. Previous efforts to control fire focused on research and monitoring – resulted in big technology leaps that Aliança now uses to track fire occurrence. These efforts, while commendable, have failed to do anything for the individuals facing the consequences. Armed with the knowledge and support of scientists and frontiersmen, Aliança is taking the fight to the field.
Until 2011, Aliança and the teams mentioned above successfully fought 90 fires, with a combined 1009 man-hours of firefighting. Of these hours, 550 were spent on properties registered in the RSR, 200 were spent in agrarian reform settlements, and 250 were spent in Protected Areas. In all, 15 ranches, 10 settlement homesteads and one state park were protected with an estimated 120,000 ha of forest saved. At 180 tons of carbon per ha (approximately 660 tons CO2), this implies a direct reduction in CO2 emissions of roughly 79 million tons.
With drought increasing as forests disappear and climate changes, and with more people moving into the vulnerable regions – especially smallholders whose frequent use of fire, while understandable in a labor constrained farming system, creates numerous ignitions sources – we, unfortunately, expect the demand for fire fighting to increase dramatically in the foreseeable future.

Delegitimisation

Delegitimisation (also spelled delegitimation) is the sociopsychological process which undermines or marginalises an entity by presenting value judgments as facts which are construed to devalue legitimacy. It is a self-justifying mechanism, with the ultimate goal of justifying harm of an outgroup. The concept applies to a wide spectrum of social contexts ranging from disputes about political entities to chronic illnesses.
Definition, function and mechanisms.
Delegitimization is the process of constructing a "categorization of groups into extreme social categories which are ultimately excluded from society". Delegitimization provides "the moral and the discursive basis to harm the delegitimized group, even in the most inhumane ways".
Daniel Bar-Tal identified five rhetorical strategies by which delegitimization occurs: dehumanization (e.g. "uncivilized savages"), trait characterization ("idiots", "parasites"), outcasting ("murderers", "terrorists"), use of political labels ("Nazis", "imperialists"), and delegitimization by group comparison (e.g. with the Huns). Volpato et al. found eight delegitimizing strategies, including trait characterisation, political labels, group comparison, segregation, outcasting and using a delegitimized group to stigmatize another group. For example, images of derogated target groups were published in the Italian Fascist magazine "La Difesa della Razza" in the 1930s.
A process affecting actual beliefs rather than mere rhetoric is presumed to be at work however. An early controlled study published in 1960 showed that "serious and violent conflict can change previously held positive views of the other group" as in the case of the 1959 border disputes between India and China, eventually leading to the 1962 Sino-Indian War. "Before the dispute, Indian students considered the Chinese to be artistic, religious, industrious, friendly, progressive, and honest. But, as the conflict developed, the Chinese were stereotyped by the same Indian students also as aggressive, cheating, selfish, war-mongering, cruel and shrewd."
Bar-Tal found that the process mostly occurs in the cases of intractable conflicts and ethnocentrism. According to Bar-Tal, in these contexts delegitimization is part of an unholy trinity together with beliefs in justness of own goals and collective self-victimhood.
History and examples.
In 1975, "delegitimization" became a kind of "buzz word" when then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Daniel Patrick Moynihan accused the international body of delegitimizing Israel by passing a "Zionism is racism " resolution. After United States President Barack Obama included the term in a 2011 speech, it developed wider international currency.
The paired concepts of "legitimize" and "de-legitimize" have gained currency in discussions about nuclear disarmament.
Arthur Kleinman found that a delegitimation discourse affects the social course of many chronic illnesses, including pain patients, disorders like chronic fatigue syndrome, and other stigmatizing illesses like schizophrenia, depression or epilepsy.
The term "Byzantine Empire" was coined in order to delegitimize the continued existence of the Roman Empire after the fall of the west and into the Middle Ages.

Albert Davis Taylor

Albert Davis (“A.D.”) Taylor (1883–1951) was an American landscape architect and author, notable for his many gardens and his promotion of garden shows. He designed parks and other public works, subdivisions and private estates, primarily in Ohio.
Taylor was born in Carlisle, Massachusetts to Nathaniel A. and Ellen F. (Davis) Taylor. He received an A.B. from Boston College in 1905 and an M.L.A. from the College of Agriculture at Cornell University in 1906, where he taught until 1908. He then joined the office of Warren H. Manning, where he was influenced by Manning’s informal and naturalistic approach to landscape design as he worked on such projects as Stan Hywet Hall in Akron.
In 1914 Taylor established his own practice in Cleveland, eventually opening a second office in Florida. His firm provided landscape design for the Van Sweringens’ Daisy Hill Estate in Cleveland, J.J. Emery’s Peterloon Estate in Cincinnati, the H.H. Timken Estate in Canton, and Julius Fleischmann’s Winding Creek Farm. The office also designed the Avondale subdivision in Akron and the Rookwood subdivision in Cincinnati. During the Depression, Taylor participated in a number of CWA projects. The following is a partial list of public works on which his firm worked:
Taylor helped found the landscape architecture program at Ohio State University and served as a non-resident professor in the program from 1916 to 1926. Notable among Taylor's many publications was his 1921 book, "The Complete Garden". During the New Deal, Taylor was a consultant for the U.S. Forest Service, conducting a needs and requirements survey of the national forests in 1936. Increasing public use of national forests made it necessary to reevaluate the standard of landscape design throughout the system in an effort to preserve the natural aspects of the forest, while accommodating their use. Taylor's papers (1918–1942) are archived at the Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan.

Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream

Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream and Kindred Studies is a fly fishing book written by G.E.M. Skues published in London in 1910. "Minor Tactics" was Skues first book and set the stage for his ascendancy as the inventor of nymph fishing for trout.
Synopsis.
Although "Minor Tactics" begins in the forward with thanks and appreciation to F. M. Halford for his "Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice" published in 1889 as the last word on chalk stream fishing for trout, the book marks Skues' long campaign to restore the wet fly to its rightful place on the chalk streams of England from which the wet fly had been banished during the dogmatic dry fly period of the last 19th century.
From the Foreword:
Rising from the perusal of "Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice" on its publication by F. M. Halford in 1889, I think I was at one with most anglers of the day in feeling that the last word had been written on the art of chalk-stream fishing—so sane, so clear, so comprehensive, is it ; so just and so in accord with one's own experience. Twenty years have gone by since then without my having had either occasion or inclination to go back at all upon this view of that, the greatest work, in my opinion, which has ever seen the light on the subject of angling for trout and grayling; and it is still, as regards that side of the subject with which it deals, all that I then believed it. But one result of the triumph of the dry fly, of which that work was the crown and consummation, was the obliteration from the minds of men, in much less than a generation, of all the wet-fly lore which had served many generations of chalk stream anglers well. The effect was stunning, hypnotic, submerging; and in these days, if one excepts a few eccentrics who have been nurtured on the wet fly on other waters, and have little experience of chalk streams, one would find few with any notion that anything but the dry fly could be effectively used upon Hampshire rivers, or that the wet fly was ever used there. I was for years myself under the spell, and it is the purpose of the ensuing pages to tell, for the benefit of the angling community, by what processes, by what stages, I have been led into a sustained effort to recover for this generation, and to transmute into forms suited to the modern conditions of sport on the chalk stream, the old wet-fly art, to be used as a supplement to, and in no sense to supplant or rival, the beautiful art of which Mr. F. M. Halford is the prophet. How far my effort has been successful I must leave my readers to judge. I myself feel that in making it I have widened my angling horizon, and that I have added enormously to the interest and charm of my angling days as well as to my chances of success, and that, too, by the use of no methods which the most rigid purist could rightly condemn, but by a difficult, delicate, fascinating, and entirely legitimate form of the art, well worthy of the naturalist sportsman.
In the course of my too rare excursions to the river-side, I have elaborated some devices, methods of attack and handling, which I have found of service, some applicable to wet-fly, some to dry-fly fishing, or to both. In the hope that these may be of interest or service, I have included papers upon them.
Reviews.
In "A History of Fly Fishing for Trout" (1921), John Waller Hills wrote:
But there is another , and that is the revival of the sunk fly, even on ground from which it was believed to have been banished for ever. This revival is due largely to the writings of Mr. G. E. M. Skues, whose Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream was published in 1910. In this book he proves conclusively that the sunk fly has its use on the shyest chalk stream, that it will kill when the dry fly will not, and that it is a form of fishing as difficult and as entrancing as the other. It is an original book, and it is no disparagement to its originality to say that it is founded on the wisdom of our ancestors. Mr. Skues is indebted to Stewart both for his method of fishing and of tying flies, a debt which he amply acknowledges. His great merit is that he has revived and brought up to date for use on chalk streams what was a lost art. He has rediscovered and restated it in terms suited to to-day. His book gives fishing a new starting point, and opens a new chapter in its history.
In "Notable Angling Literature" (1945) James Robb said of Skues and "Minor Tactics"
One of the subtlest writers on fishing with fly in any form is G.E.M. Skues, the author of "Nymph Fishing". His book "Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream", put and end to the dry-fly purist and brought the angling world back to sanity
In "A Summer on the Test" (1930) by John Waller Hill as quoted by Arnold Gingrich in "The Fishing in Print" (1974) Hills wrote:
When, exactly twenty years ago, Mr. Skues wrote "Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream", he effected a revolution. The dry fly was a height of its intolerant dictatorship, and the other method was discarded and ridiculed to such an extent that enthusiasts of the school of Halford regarded Mr. Skues as a dangerous heresiarch... More and more each year does nymph fishing become part of the modern angler's equipment, and he who does not possess the art is gravely handicapped...Flies got smaller and smaller, but it was not until Mr. G.E.M.

Primula deorum

Primula deorum (also known as Rila Primrose, Rila Cowslip or God's Cowslip) is a flowering dicot plant of the genus "Primula" in the Primulaceae family. This alpine plant is endemic to roughly 63 km2 above the tree-line (especially around 2200 metres) in the Rila mountains in Bulgaria, where it grows in small groups in acid, boggy soil near streams and pools and in boggy soil. Its elongate green leaves form rosettes. The blooms are red-purple, borne in asymmetrical umbels high above the leaves. This plant has survived the last glacial period as a relict organism.
It is sometimes offered as an ornamental, but is difficult to cause to flower. The best success comes from a well-aerated, wet medium consisting partly or entirely of sphagnum; flowing water is advisable.
The name "God's Cowslip" and the species epithet "deorum" refer to the presence of this species on Musala, "God's Mountain", though it is much more common above Malyovitsa, where it is the dominant plant in suitable spots.

Americana (game show)

Americana is a weekly game show which ran on NBC from December 8, 1947 to July 4, 1949. The series was originally hosted by literary critic John Mason Brown and produced by Martin Stone Productions with NBC Television. Each week's show was sponsored by "Encyclopedia Americana". The 30-minute show aired Mondays at 8:10pm ET in the 1947-48 television season, and Mondays at 8:30pm ET in the 1948-49 season.
Format.
The quiz, whose slogan was "Your program about your country", involved five contestants (originally adults, changed to high school students by March 1949) answering viewer-submitted questions about American history. A panel of three actors would perform short skits (with either one actor or more in each), after which the contestants would try to answer the questions.
Hosts.
On January 21, 1948, Brown was replaced by composer and musical critic Deems Taylor, who only hosted that show and the January 28 episode. On February 4 he was replaced by Ben Grauer, who was at the time recognized for hosting "Information Please" on NBC Radio since 1938.
In 1949, Vivian Ferrer joined Grauer as co-host, likely remaining with the series through its end.
Episode status.
"Americana" was one of the first victims of wiping, a process that was continued by three of the four networks on the air at the time (DuMont rarely disposed of any material) through the late 1970s.
The March 14, 1949 episode is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Michael Keane, Dan Roberts, and Oscar Brand were the actors; Elliot Mendelson, Vivian Frost, Elizabeth Mulligan, Joan Moran, and Michael Drake were the contestants. Vivian Ferrer is not mentioned as co-host, implying that she had not been hired at this point.
The surviving episode has been confirmed to be the second-oldest television game show episode known to exist, the oldest being from the mid-1947 game "Party Line" hosted by Bert Parks (which is held on kinescope at the Library of Congress).

Ernst Wynder

Ernst Ludwig Wynder, M.D. (1922-1999) was an American epidemiology and public health researcher who studied the risk factors of smoking tobacco. His 1950 coauthored publication of "Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of 684 Proved Cases" appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It was one of the first major scientific publications identifying smoking as a contributory cause of lung cancer.
Biography.
Wynder was born in Herford, Germany in 1922 to Jewish parents (a cousin of Robert Weinberg). In 1938 his family escaped Nazi rule and fled to the United States, where Wynder enrolled at New York University. During World War II, he attained citizenship and joined the U.S. Army, where, as a German-speaker, he was assigned to a psychological warfare unit to monitor German newscasts. After the war, he attended medical school at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1950, he received both a bachelor of science and a medical degree. Aside from his credentials as a physician, Wynder was a researcher, educator, and activist. He devoted his career to the study and prevention of cancer and chronic disease, including the publication of hundreds of scientific papers. Through the 1950s and 1960s, he worked at Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. In 1969, he founded the American Health Foundation. In 1972, he founded the academic journal Preventive Medicine (journal) and served as the founding editor. Wynder died on July 14, 1999.Also see Wynder's obituary in "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report" 48(43), page 987</ref>
Scholarship.
Smoking and Lung Cancer Studies.
Wynder began collaborating with his coauthor on the article, Evarts Ambrose Graham, as a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis in 1947. The previous summer he had conducted epidemiological studies of smoking behavior among 146 lung cancer patients in New York City. The project was funded by the American Cancer Society. Now, with Graham, Wynder collected extensive data on 604 patients with lung cancer at hospitals across the United States. Departing from a tradition of using anecdotal evidence (e.g., clinical interviews) to develop explanations of disease causation, Wynder and Graham applied rudimentary statistical methods to their study. They divided patients into crude categories of "moderate" or "heavy" smokers, based on retrospective interviews of each patient's smoking behavior over a twenty-year period. They also measured and controlled for important confounding factors (e.g., age, types of tobacco use, inhalation level). Most importantly, with regard to an ability to demonstrate causation, Wynder and Graham also studied a control group of cancer-free individuals in hospitals. They systematically compared the lung cancer patients to the control group.
On May 27, 1950 the Journal of the American Medical Association published the resulting scientific report. Wynder and Graham found that lung cancer could develop among nonsmokers, implying that smoking is not the single factor in the induction of disease. But they identified smoking as a significant risk factor for lung cancer, based on four findings: 1) Lung cancer was rare in nonsmokers; 2) Among patients with lung cancer, cigarette use tended to be high; 3) Lung cancer incidence among men and women matched patterns of smoking behavior in men and women; 4) "the enormous increase in the sale of cigarettes in this country approximately parallels the increase in cancer." As further scientific evidence of smoking's role in causing lung cancer began to mount in the United States and Great Britain, Wynder and Graham investigated the biological plausibility of the association between smoking and lung disease. In 1950, they initiated a study of the impact of tars from tobacco smoke on mice. After a year of exposure to tar, 44 percent of the mice developed cancers. Wynder also discovered specific carcinogens in tar (e.g., benzopyrenes, arsenic), but was unable to identify the contributions of these chemicals to cancer.
Wynder's studies of tobacco smoke were timely and important. Whereas laboratory studies of tobacco tar had been conducted elsewhere, Wynder's findings supported the growing epidemiological data. "The production of tumors in lab animals offered a powerful indicator that something in cigarette smoke could account for the epidemiological findings," writes Allan M. Brandt, a historian of medicine.
Other Research.
Wynder published nearly 800 papers during his lifetime. Wynder's work appeared in 139 periodicals and one book. More than half of his articles were published in ten prestigious mainline journals, such as "Cancer", the flagship journal of the American Cancer Society. The dominant themes were lung and breast cancer, but there were also in-depth studies of the epidemiology of cancer of the bladder, larynx, colon and rectum, stomach, ovary, prostate, pancreas, and kidney, as well as numerous experimental studies. Many of these papers were the first or most comprehensive studies ever published, especially the massive 1960 coauthored study of the epidemiology of breast cancer.

Kasarna

The Kasarna ("Barracks") is a historic building in the Stara Sava district of the town of Jesenice, Slovenia. Formerly a residential block, it is currently an ethnographic museum. It is located at "48 Prešerenova".
History.
The Kasarna was built at the end of the 18th century, in Late Baroque style. It received its current name during the Napoleonic wars, when it served as a barracks for French soldiers; afterward, it reverted to the local ironworking industry and housed workers and their families. 
In 2005, the building was thoroughly renovated. Operated by the Upper Sava Museum, its ethnographic collection includes a reconstructed workers’ flat from the 1930s and 1940s, which presents the residential culture and way of life of the Jesenice working class at that time. 
The Kasarna hosts museum workshops aimed toward different age groups. It also houses a small photo gallery, the historic archives of the KID company, and the Jesenice Music School.

Graph continuous function

In mathematics, and in particular the study of game theory, a function is graph continuous if it exhibits the following properties. The concept was originally defined by Partha Dasgupta and Eric Maskin in 1986 and is a version of continuity that finds application in the study of continuous games.
Notation and preliminaries.
Consider a game with formula_1 agents with agent formula_2 having strategy formula_3; write formula_4 for an N-tuple of actions (i.e. formula_5) and formula_6 as the vector of all agents' actions apart from agent formula_2.
Let formula_8 be the payoff function for agent formula_2.
A game is defined as formula_10.
If a graph is continuous you should connect it if it's not then don't connect it.
Definition.
Function formula_11 is graph continuous if for all formula_12 there exists a function formula_13 such that formula_14 is continuous at formula_15.
Dasgupta and Maskin named this property "graph continuity" because, if one plots a graph of a player's payoff as a function of his own strategy (keeping the other players' strategies fixed), then a graph-continuous payoff function will result in this graph changing continuously as one varies the strategies of the other players.
The property is interesting in view of the following theorem.
If, for formula_16, formula_17 is non-empty, convex, and compact; and if formula_11 is quasi-concave in formula_19, upper semi-continuous in formula_4, and graph continuous, then the game formula_10 possesses a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

1948–49 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1948–49 campaign is referred to in Town folklore as the original "Great Escape" season (the second being the 1997–98 season), when Arnold Rodgers scored the goal that saw Town maintain their 1st Division status. His goal against Manchester City, with 10 minutes of the last match of the season remaining saw Town keep their status and relegate Preston North End and Sheffield United in the process.
Review.
Town's fortunes during the season didn't seem to improve on the previous season. Even the 14 goals from veteran Peter Doherty didn't seem to pull Town away from almost certain relegation. Relegation seemed to be certain for 2 out of Town, Preston North End and Sheffield United. With 10 minutes of Town's last match at home against Manchester City seemed to be heading down the trapdoor to Division 2.
But, an uncharacteristic error by legendary goalkeeper Frank Swift gave Arnold Rodgers the chance to score, which he did. Town won 1–0 which relegated Preston & Sheffield and meant Town would live to fight another day.

TeachingBooks.net

TeachingBooks.net is a licensed online database that can be used by teachers, students, librarians and families to explore children's books and young adult literature and their authors. The database provides access to educational materials and programs (short movies, audio book readings, book discussion guides, and more) that add a multimedia dimension to reading in the classroom, library, and home. The office of TeachingBooks.net is located in Madison, Wisconsin. The company and database were imagined and founded by Nick Glass.
History and Vision.
The database was founded upon the premise that educators find enjoyment and professional value in seeing and hearing authors talk about their work. Nick Glass, the founder, had hosted many author presentations in his previous work — bringing authors to bookstores, schools, libraries, and conferences — and had arranged live author programs for educators over a distance-learning video network. Each author interaction with educators inspired new insights for teaching and sharing books with children.
In April 2000, the genesis for the database took form. It debuted at the American Library Association convention in San Francisco in June 2001 and was launched on the Internet September 1, 2001. It began selling licenses in November 2003.
Common Uses.
The TeachingBooks.net database is used in educational as well as home settings. Educators often use the site to host virtual author visits so students can "meet" and learn from professional writers via the audio and video resources on the site. Movies of Caldecott-winning illustrators demonstrate art processes. Audio excerpts are used by students, including English Language Learners, to independently learn the rhythm, pace, and sound of the books they are reading. Educators and students also use TeachingBooks.net to listen to poets read their work, get information for author/illustrator studies, and to find book guides for fiction and non-fiction titles.
Original Content.
TeachingBooks.net specializes in creating original content with authors and illustrators. Staff from the database interview children's and young adult authors in their homes to create brief Author Program videos.
In the Original Author Program videos, authors discuss journaling, doing research, storytelling, reader's theatre, bringing history to life, and working with inspiring ideas. Illustrators show techniques they use to create picture books, graphic novels, and more.
Staff at TeachingBooks.net also call authors to record original book readings, in which authors share the inspiration behind their books and read brief excerpts.
Author Name Pronunciation Guide.
The "TeachingBooks.net Author Name Pronunciation Guide" is an online audio collection of authors and illustrators pronouncing their names. Authors dial-in to a toll-free number and leave a voice message in which they pronounce their name and share the history of their name. These messages are digitized, edited, and uploaded to TeachingBooks.net. The Author Name Pronunciation Guide is available freely on the web and does not require a subscription to TeachingBooks.net. It can be used to learn how to correctly pronounce an author's name.

Kierra Sheard

Kierra Valencia "Kiki" Sheard (born June 20, 1987) is an American gospel recording artist. She is the daughter of gospel singer Karen Clark Sheard (member of gospel singing group The Clark Sisters) and the granddaughter of gospel choral director Mattie Moss Clark.
Early life.
Born in Detroit, Michigan, and raised in the suburb of West Bloomfield, Sheard spent her formative years surrounded by the influences of her family, their faith, and their music. At age 6, she began singing in the choir at Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ, pastored by her father Bishop J. Drew Sheard. Even at a young age, Sheard had a preternatural grip on the signature "Clark sound" pioneered by her mother and aunts, executing high and fast melismata, riffs, runs, and deep, throaty growls sometimes referred to as "squalls" (the latter is prominently displayed on "Done Did It", a traditional gospel leaning track from her album "I Owe You").
Music career.
1997–2003: Early career.
Sheard made her professional stage debut at the age of 10 performing on two tracks on her mother's debut solo album Finally Karen in 1997. One of those songs was "The Will Of God", penned by Evangelist Richard "Mr. Clean" White as the standout closing track. The song won a Stellar Award for Best Children's Performance the following year. In the years following, she honed and matured her skills as a performer and vocalist. Sheard started singing as a background vocalist for her mother, her aunt Dorinda Clark-Cole, and The Clark Sisters. In 2002, Sheard was featured on her aunt Dorinda's self-titled debut album. The following year, she performed two tracks again on her mothers' third album, The Heavens Are Telling. On "The Heavens Are Telling", she was featured with her mother on a popular cover of Jill Scott's He Loves Me (Lyzel In E Flat). In 2003, EMI Gospel won a bidding war between several record companies to sign Sheard to her first recording contract.
2004–2005: "I Owe You".
Her debut album "I Owe You" was released on September 7, 2004. The 11-track set included production and songwriting from such notable music luminaries as Rodney Jerkins, Warryn Campbell, Erica and Tina Campbell of Mary Mary, J Moss, and Tonéx. The album also functioned as the production debut for her brother J Drew.
The following year, EMI commissioned a collection of remixes entitled "Just Until..." on August 2, 2005. The title of the stopgap release was abbreviated from its working title "Just Until The Next Record". The album had a surprise international hit in The Godson Concept remix of "Let Go". The upbeat gospel single, released only in Japan, raced to the top of mainstream R&B charts and remained there for several weeks.
2006–2007: "This is Me".
Shortly after graduating high school, Sheard readied her second album "This Is Me". It debuted at #1 on "Billboard"'s Top Gospel Albums chart when it was released June 27, 2006. A midtempo fan favorite, the Fred Jerkins III-produced "Why Me?" was chosen as the lead single for the album. Sheard shot her first music videos for two subsequent singles from the album, "Yes" and "This Is Me". The album was Grammy Award-nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Gospel Album in December 2006.
In addition to performing at the 2007 Stellar Awards ("Why Me?"), Sheard appeared on BET's Celebration of Gospel standing in for pregnant Faith Evans in "Endow Me" (as popularized by Sheard's aunts) along with Coko, Lil' Mo, and Fantasia. Sheard also sang with her mother for "A Tribute to Aretha Franklin".
2008–2009: "Bold Right Life".
In October 2008, Sheard released her third album, "Bold Right Life". The album spawned the two lead singles "Praise Him Now" and "Won't Hold Back". Sheard was also featured on what would be the biggest single of her career to date, "God In Me", from Mary Mary's The Sound album.
In January 2009, Sheard appeared at the BMI Trailblazers performing "Jesus Is a Love Song" as a salute to her aunt, Elbernita "Twinkie" Clark.
Sheard released a greatest hits EP entitled KiKi's Mixtape on September 22, 2009. The EP included 3 new unreleased songs, 2 remixes, singles from previous albums and "This Christmas" with Marcus Cole.
2010–present: "Free" and "The Sheards".
Sheard had a role in "Preacher's Kid" (starring platinum-selling R&B artist LeToya Luckett, Durrell Babbs, Clifton Powell, Gregory Alan Williams, Sharif Atkins) which was released in theaters across the U.S. on January 29, 2010 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on May 4, 2010.
Sheard's fourth album, titled "Free", was released on October 18, 2011. This, being Sheard's first album on her family's gospel label, Karew Records (pronounced Kuh-Rue). Originally scheduled for a July 2011 release, the album was leaked and subsequently pushed back and reformatted with a different tracklisting. The album features Sheard's BRL (Bold Right Life) Choir.
On April 7, 2013, Sheard and her family debuted in a new "BET" reality series entitled, "The Sheards". The show is based on the lives of Sheard, her brother and producer, J. Drew, and her parents, Grammy-award winning Karen Clark Sheard and Pastor J. Drew Sheard Sr. Season 1 had a run of eight episodes, and it was announced by the "BET" Twitter account that 
Season 2 will debut in Fall 2013.
Personal life.
Sheard is a graduate of Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, where she received her bachelors degree in English with a minor in psychology. Though her touring schedule has been curbed to accommodate her academic goals, Sheard did embark on a Japanese tour with her mother Karen Clark-Sheard in August 2006.

Dennis Woodhead

Dennis Woodhead (12 June 1925 – 26 July 1995) was a professional footballer whose career lasted from 1947 until 1959 during which time he played for Sheffield Wednesday, Chesterfield, Derby County and Southport. Woodhead was primarily a left winger who also played as a stand in centre forward when needed. Throughout his career he made 343 appearances including FA Cup matches and scored 108 goals.
Early life.
Woodhead, a grandson of former Wednesday player Billy Betts, was born on 12 June 1925 in the Hillsborough area of Sheffield. As a schoolboy he represented Sheffield Boys at both football and cricket. Upon leaving school he played football for his works team Edgar Allen’s for whom he worked as a fitter. At the same time he also played for Hillsborough Boys Club, a nursery side for Sheffield Wednesday. In 1941 the 16 year old Woodhead was invited to train with Sheffield Wednesday, however his initial connection with the club was brief, playing just one wartime match, before joining the RAF as a bomber flight engineer. Woodhead completed 31 bombing missions during World War II and was finally de-mobbed from the RAF in early 1947.
Professional career.
Sheffield Wednesday.
Woodhead had signed full professional terms with Sheffield Wednesday in April 1945 whilst still on active war service and he made his debut for the club on 24 May 1947 shortly after leaving the RAF. He played the last three games of that 1946-47 season as Wednesday managed to avoid relegation from Division Two. The following two seasons saw Woodhead miss only eight league matches as he made the left wing position his own. However on the first day of the 1949-50 season (20 August) he broke his right leg in a 3-1 victory over Leicester City and did not return to the first team until the Christmas Eve home match against Bradford City where he scored a late equaliser. The fine form of Walter Rickett kept Woodhead out of the side for much of the remainder of the season although he did return for the vital last few matches of the campaign as Wednesday gained promotion to the First Division.
Woodhead returned as a regular to the team in the following season in Division One, scoring 14 goals and ending as joint top scorer with Hugh McJarrow and Redfern Froggatt. Woodhead played the last nine games of the campaign as a stand in Centre Forward, scoring nine goals as Wednesday struggled in attack and were eventually relegated. The start of following season saw Woodhead again playing at centre forward, scoring seven goals in the opening nine games before picking up a bad injury. This allowed Derek Dooley to force his way into the side, scoring an amazing 46 goals in 30 appearances as Wednesday lifted the Second Division championship.
Woodhead remained first choice left winger for the following two seasons in Division One, doing especially well in 1953-54 when he top scored with 21 goals including three in the FA Cup as Wednesday reached the semi-final where they lost to Preston North End at Maine Road. The 1954-55 campaign saw Woodhead lose his regular spot in the team as Wednesday had a disastrous season, being relegated by nine points. He was in and out of the team as Alan Finney and Jackie Marriott played in the wing positions and limited Woodhead to just ten appearances in his final season at Hillsborough. Following relegation Wednesday manager Eric Taylor decided to rebuild the team and brought in 20 year old Albert Broadbent from Notts County as a replacement for the 30 year old Woodhead.
Latter career.
Woodhead was signed by Chesterfield manager Teddy Davison for a fee of £2,000 on 9 September 1955 and made a thrilling debut scoring three goals in a 7-2 home win over Rochdale. He was selected to play for the Third Division North team against the South in 1955/56. However his stay at Saltergate lasted only four months, making 16 appearances in total before joining Derby County in January 1956 for a fee of £1,500. Woodhead had three good seasons with Derby, helping them to promotion from Division Three North in 1956-57 when he scored 14 goals. In February 1959 he was sold to Southport for £750 but the move only lasted four games after it was found that Woodhead had an ongoing knee injury and he was instructed to return to Derby by The Football League after a month. Woodhead retired from full time League football in May 1959.
After playing.
After finishing as a professional, Woodhead played non-league football for Frickley Colliery, Retford Town and Worksop Town, also acting as player-manager for Frickley and Retford.

<doc id="19675057" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19675057" title="Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex">
Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex

An upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex is a vortex, or a circulation with a definable center, that usually moves slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest and is prevalent across Northern Hemisphere's warm season. Its circulations generally do not extend below in altitude, as it is an example of a cold-core low. A weak inverted wave in the easterlies is generally found beneath it, and it may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of cumulus clouds and the appearance of circulation at ground level. In rare cases, a warm-core cyclone can develop in its associated convective activity, resulting in a tropical cyclone and a weakening and southwest movement of the nearby upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex. Symbiotic relationships can exist between tropical cyclones and the upper level lows in their wake, with the two systems occasionally leading to their mutual strengthening. When they move over land during the warm season, an increase in monsoon rains occurs.
History of research.
Using charts of mean 200-hectopascal circulation for July through August (located above sea level) to locate the circumpolar troughs and ridges, trough lines extend over the eastern and central North Pacific and over the North Atlantic. Case studies of upper tropospheric cyclones in the Atlantic and Pacific have been performed by using airplane reports (winds, temperatures and heights), radiosonde data, geostationary satellite cloud imagery, and cloud-tracked winds throughout the troposphere. It was determined they were the origin of an upper tropospheric cold-core lows, or cut-off lows.
Characteristics.
The tropical upper tropospheric cyclone has a cold core, meaning it is stronger aloft than at the Earth's surface, or stronger in areas of the troposphere with lower pressures. This is explained by the thermal wind relationship. It also means that a pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. If both an upper tropospheric cold-core low and lower tropospheric easterly wave trough are in-phase, with the easterly wave near or to the east of the upper level cyclone, thunderstorm development (also known as moist convection) is enhanced. If they are out-of-phase, with the tropical wave west of the upper level circulation, convection is suppressed due to convergence aloft leading to downward motion over the tropical wave or surface trough in the easterlies. Upper level cyclones also interact with troughs in the subtropical westerlies, such as cold fronts and stationary fronts. When the subtropical disturbances in the Northern Hemisphere actively move southward, or dig, the area between the upper tropospheric anticyclone to its west and cold-core low to its east generally have strong northeasterly winds in addition to a rapid development of active thunderstorm activity. Cloud bands associated with upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices are aligned with the vertical wind shear. Animated satellite cloud imagery is a better tool for their early detection and tracking. The low-level convergence caused by the cut-off low can trigger squall lines and rough seas, and the low-level spiral cloud bands caused by the upper level circulation are parallel to the low-level wind direction. This has also been witnessed with upper level lows which occur at higher latitudes. For example, in areas where small-scale snow bands develop within the cold sector of extratropical cyclones.
Climatology.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) normally occurs between May and November, with peak activity between July and September. James Sadler suggested a revised model for the TUTT during the early part of the typhoon season in the western Pacific. Both Sadler and Lance Bosart have shown that the tropical upper tropospheric trough cyclonic cells are caused by the mid-latitude disturbance riding around the western side of the tropical upper tropospheric trough when the subtropical ridge to its south is quite weak. In the north Atlantic, the TUTT is characterized by the semi-permanent circulation pattern that forms in the North Atlantic between August and November. Toby Carlson evaluated data over the eastern Caribbean sea for October 1965 and pinpointed the presence of an upper tropospheric cold-core cyclone. These cold-core cyclones generally form close to the Azores and move south and westward towards a latitude of 20°N. These circulations extend over an area of about 20° of latitude (or ) and 40° of longitude. The lowest level of closed circulation underneath the upper level cold-core cyclone is often between the 700 and the 500-hectopascal level ( to above sea level). Their life cycles span 5 to 14 days.
The upper tropospheric cyclonic centers in the North Atlantic differ from that in the North Pacific. Most of them are detectable in the low tropospheric temperature field as cold troughs in the easterlies. They tend to vertically tilt toward the northeast. Cumulonimbus clouds and rainfall occur in the southeast quadrant, approximately 5° latitude (or ) from the upper cyclone center. Large variations of cloud cover can exist in different systems. The summer tropical upper tropospheric trough is a dominant feature over the trade wind regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea, and that the lower tropospheric responses to the tropical upper tropospheric trough in the North Atlantic are differ from those in the North Pacific.
Interaction with tropical cyclones.
The summer TUTT in the Southern Hemisphere lies over the trade wind region of the east central Pacific and can cause tropical cyclogenesis offshore Central America. University of Hawaii Professor James C. Sadler has documented tropical cyclones over the eastern North Pacific that were revealed by weather satellite observations, and suggested that the upper-tropospheric circulation is a factor in the development, as well as the life history, of the tropical cyclones. Ralph Huschke and Gary Atkinson proposed that a moist southwest wind that results from southeast trades of the eastern South Pacific deflecting towards the Pacific coasts of Central America between June and November, is known as the "temporale". Temporales are most frequent in July and August, when they can reach gale force and cause rough seas/swell. The area of heavy rain is generally located in the northeast quadrant approximately 5° of latitude (or ) from the eye. In the western Pacific, tropical upper tropospheric lows are the main cause for the few tropical cyclones which develop north of the 20th parallel north and east of the 160th meridian east during La Nina events.
Trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in the intensification process of tropical cyclones. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet stream emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone. In the western North Pacific, there are strong reciprocal relationships between the areas of formative tropical cyclones and that of the lower tropospheric monsoon troughs and the tropical upper tropospheric trough. Tropical cyclone movement can also be influenced by TUTT cells within of their position, which can lead to non-climatological tropical cyclone tracks.
Interaction with monsoon regimes.
As upper level lows retrograde over land masses, they can enhance thunderstorm activity during the afternoon. This magnifies regional monsoon regimes, such as that over western North America near the United States and Mexican border, which can be used to effectively forecast monsoon surges in precipitation magnitude. Across the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.

Armley Canal Road railway station was a station on the former Midland Railway between Leeds and Shipley. It served the Leeds suburb of Armley in West Yorkshire, England until closure in 1965.
History.
Opened by the Leeds and Bradford Railway in 1846 (which was subsequently absorbed by the Midland Railway), it became part of the :London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948 and was then closed by the British Railways Board as part of the Beeching Axe.

The main station building still survives on Canal Road (as can be seen from the accompanying photo) and is used as commercial premises. The owners re-painted the station sign, though not in the original colours or font. However nothing remains of the station at rail level other than the gap between the lines where the island platform formerly stood.

Sir William Stewart Duke-Elder, GCVO, DSc, LLD, MD, PhD, FRCP, FRCS, FRS (22 April 1898 — 27 March 1978), a Scottish ophthalmologist born in Tealing near Dundee, was a dominant force in his field for more than a quarter of a century. 
His father was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland in Tealing, the Rev. Neil Elder. 
He entered the University of St Andrews in 1915 on scholarship and graduated in 1919 with a BSc in Physiology and MA (Hons) in Natural Sciences. He graduated from the University of St Andrews School of Medicine in 1923 with an MB ChB. In 1925 he earned an MD from St Andrews for his dissertation on 'Reaction of the eye to changes in osmotic pressure of the blood'. In 1927, he earned a DSc from St Andrews for his thesis on 'The nature of the intraocular fluids and the pressure equilibrium in the eye'. He is best remembered as a talented and prolific writer and editor, producing seven volumes of "Textbook of Ophthalmology" and fifteen volumes of "System of Ophthalmology", along with many other textbooks and scientific papers that provided the educational foundation for most of the world's ophthalmologists. This monumental contribution to medical literature earned him the title of Fellow of the Royal Society in 1960. 
In addition to his own writings, Duke-Elder served for many years as editor and chairman of the editorial committee of the "British Journal of Ophthalmology and Ophthalmic Literature" and he was instrumental in the formation and research direction of the Institute of Ophthalmology, now part of the University College London. He was knighted in 1933 and subsequently earned many more honors, serving as the Surgeon-Oculist to King Edward VIII, George VI and Queen Elizabeth II. In 1946 he formed the Faculty of Ophthalmologists.
He was awarded the 1957 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 28 March 1958, and was titled 'The Emergence of Vision in the Animal World'.

Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2012

The Ukrainian parliamentary election of 2012 took place on 28 October 2012. Because of various reasons, including the "impossibility of announcing election results" various by-elections have taken place since. Hence, several constituencies have been left not represented at various times.
Unlike the two previous elections, this election used a mixed voting system (50% under party lists and 50% under simple-majority constituencies) with a 5% election threshold and the participation of blocs of political parties was not allowed any more. The method of 50/50 mixed elections was used previously in 1998 and 2002.
The election campaign was limited to 90 days. Every citizen of Ukraine 18 years of age or older was able to vote in 33,540 polling stations in Ukraine and 116 foreign polling stations in 77 countries.
The Party of Regions won the largest number of seats while Fatherland (it united several parties together as an "umbrella" party) came second. The election was also noted for the rise of the far-right party Svoboda, which came in fourth. The (new on the national scene) party UDAR also enjoyed noticeable great success with its third place in the election. The Communist Party of Ukraine almost tripled its numbers of voters but because of the mixed election system used in the election it only won five more seats compared with the previous election. Because of this mixed system three small parties and 43 unaffiliated politicians also made it into parliament.
The new parliament was appointed and started its tasks on 12 December 2012 – six weeks after the elections.
Background.
Political crises and canceled 2008 snap elections.
On October 8, 2008 Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko tried to dissolve the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) and called early parliamentary elections in Ukraine for the second time in as many years for December 7, 2008. The right of the President to dismiss the parliament was challenged in Ukraine's Constitutional Court. The President's decree has since lapsed as it was never put into action (the coalition supporting the second Tymoshenko Government was extended) and appeals to Ukraine's Constitutional Court were withdrawn. Nevertheless a snap election was predicted by Ukrainian politicians during the 2010 presidential election and after the dismissal of the second Tymoshenko Government. One of the arguments against holding early elections were the costs. Early elections were (in October 2008) estimated to cost approximately UAH₴417 million (about EUR€60 million or US$80 million).
2012 election date set.
On February 1, 2011 the Verkhovna Rada set the election date for October 28, 2012. Several deputies whose votes were registered that day have stated they could not have taken part in voting because they were not in Kiev (where the Verkhovna Rada building is located) on February 1, 2011. Voting by MPs in the place of absent MPs of the Verkhovna Rada is prohibited by law. On July 27, 2012 the Central Election Commission of Ukraine announced that campaigning for the elections would commence on July 30.
Changes in the voting system.
In June, 2011 the Venice Commission reviewed a proposed Draft Law on the election of Ukrainian parliamentary members. The proposal sought to re-instate a parallel voting system – used in the 1998 and 2002 elections – with the establishment of 225 local single-member districts elected (in one round) by a first-past-the-post electoral system (candidate with the highest vote total wins); and the remaining 225 parliamentary seats being elected nationwide on a proportional party-list system with a 5% support threshold; and excluding political blocs from all elections. The option "Vote against all" was also made defunct in the proposal (according to a November 2012 opinion poll by Research & Branding Group (otherwise) 17% of the voters would have voted "against everybody" during the elections). The opposition and Ukrainian analysts accused the Party of Regions of "rewriting the law so that the president could secure a majority in the next Verkhovna Rada." In October 2011 the Venice Commission recommended Ukraine should not return to a mixed election system. Nevertheless, on 17 November 2011 the Ukrainian Parliament approved an election law almost identical to the June 2011 proposed Draft Law. This new law satisfied the major opposition parties Batkivschyna and Front for Change; but was condemned by the core party of Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, Our Ukraine. Candidates could be elected on party lists or through self-nomination. On 8 December 2011 President Viktor Yanukovych signed the new election law. Since then several parties merged with other parties.
The possibility to be simultaneously be nominated on a nationwide party list and in a single mandate constituency also was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on 10 April 2012.
Voters could temporarily change their place of voting without changing their permanent voting address.
Issues.
Fraud suspicions and accusations.
Candidates and analysts predicted that bribery to secure votes would be rampant. A March 2012 poll by Research & Branding Group showed that 66% of the respondents believed that the election would not be fair, 18% disagreed with that. Following the elections the parties Fatherland, UDAR and Svoboda filled in an appeal at the Central Election Commission of Ukraine (CVK) with allegations of fraud in 13 simple-majority constituencies. Irregularities in the elections like cases of ballot stuffing, carousel voting, suspiciously high voter turnout (per example 100% in Horlivka; nationwide voter turnout was 57.99%) and bribed voters have been reported. On 30 October 2012 the Committee of Voters of Ukraine stated that the elections saw a record number of cases of bribery of voters. They also insisted the elections had not brought the country closer to democratic standards. And that although there were no grounds to believe that the violations that were reported on polling day could affect the election results, the election results could seriously be affected by violations during the counting of votes.
According to Opora the most common violations of the electoral law during the election campaign in August were using government resources for partisan purposes and vote buying. According to Opora the Party of Regions committed the most violations of the electoral law. On 28 October 2012 Party of Regions itself claimed to have documented 607 violations of the election legislation by its opponents. In June 2012 the Committee of Voters of Ukraine declared that the use of government resources for partisan ends would not be decisive in the (then upcoming) elections. According to Taras Kuzio Berkut riot police was used in attempts to destroy ballots.
On 1 November 2012 the Deputy Chairwoman of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine (CVK), Zhanna Usenko-Chorna, stated that the elections are heavily falsified. She indicated that several electoral districts clearly demonstrate a depravity of the single-constituency district elections in Ukraine and that as of 1 November CVK still had not received results from 14 electoral districts. According to her that was the main reason why CVK could not announce the complete results of the elections on the scheduled time, 31 October 2012.
In mid-February 2012 Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko deputy Roman Zabzalyuk stated that "if the results on Election Day can’t be sufficiently fixed" the Party of Regions had already made plans to bribe deputies to join the Party of Regions after their election into the Parliament; representatives of the Party of Regions denied allegations of bribery or plans to fix the election.
Issues at districts.
Kiev and its region.
A notably reported scandal took place at the electoral district 215 where initially a win was awarded to the acting chairman of the Kiev city council Halyna Hereha. After the results were challenged it was decided to recount the votes with about 30 law enforcement personnel to keep public order. Later everything was resolved and cleared that indeed the votes between the two candidates Hereha (independent) and Andriy Illyenko ("Svoboda") were switched around. On November 1, 2012 Halyna Hereha officially complained about the elections, but does not intend to take it to court.
To another electoral district 211 in Kiev was sent an ambulance as a deputy chairman of the district electoral commission had a nervous breakdown. The commission of the district for three days had a difficult time to count all the votes.
Another big scandal with involvement of the riot law enforcement unit of Berkut took place at the 95th electoral district (a Kievan suburban city of Irpin). The electoral commission at the district was the slowest and the public involvement surely did not help to speed up the process, however a possible miscounting was prevented. Previously, a possible riot from a big "youth group of athletic posture" was suspected by witnesses.
Another scandal took place at the 223rd district where some fist fighting took place, which was eventually extinguished with the help of law enforcement. Oleh Tyahnybok told Ukrayinska Pravda that "Svoboda" will be picketing "EpiCenter" supermarkets and apartments of the 223rd electoral district commission members. Because of the incident, the Radio Liberty (Radio Svoboda) conducts a live broadcasting from the headquarters of the district. In protest the district electoral commission refuses to continue its work.
Southern Ukraine.
At the 132nd district (Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast) peasants laid a siege around the building of the district electoral commission in the protest of post-electoral results.
Repeat elections in 5 constituencies.
The Central Election Commission of Ukraine adopted a resolution on November 5 recognizing the impossibility of announcing election results in five single-seat constituencies (electoral districts 94, 132, 194, 197 and 223); it also recognized the need to hold repeat elections in these constituencies and asked parliament to take a decision on holding repeat elections in these constituencies. On November 6 the Verkhovna Rada adopted a resolution that proposed repeat elections. On 8 November the Central Election Commission stated that the Verkhovna Rada should thus make a respective law for this and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine should determine the amount of funding for these elections.
On 29 December 2012, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine received a query from 54 Verkhovna Rada members concerning procedures for the five repeat elections. As of 21 March 2013 the Constitutional Court has not opened a case on this issue. The current Verkhovna Rada parliamentary majority refused to consider the scheduling of repeated elections in the five constituencies before the court issues its ruling on this issue.
On 5 September 2013 the Verkhovna Rada set the date of (all, see below) 7 re-elections to 15 December 2013.
Repeat elections in 2 more constituencies.
In early February 2013 the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine ordered the Central Election Commission of Ukraine to hold new elections in 2 more districts after the court removed the deputy mandates of United Centre member Pavlo Baloha (at the time a member of the Party of Regions parliamentary faction) and independent Oleksandr Dombrovsky. The Administrative Court established that the results in single-member districts number 11 (Vinnytsia Oblast; Dombrovsky) and number 71 (Zakarpattia Oblast; Baloha) after the 2012 elections had been "unreliable". On 3 July 2013 Baloha's and Dombrovsky's mandates were officially cancelled.
On 5 September 2013 the Verkhovna Rada set the date of (all, see above) 7 re-elections to 15 December 2013.
By-election in constituency 224 (Sevastopol).
On 24 December 2012 President Viktor Yanukovych appointed Pavlo Lebedyev as Defense Minister. Lebedyev had been elected as a lawmaker in the single-seat constituency No. 224 (in Sevastopol) in the 2012 election (28 October 2012). On 22 March 2013 the Verkhovna Rada cancelled his parliamentary mandate. The by-election for the single-seat constituency No. 224 was held on 7 July 2013 and won by independent Vadim Novinsky with 53.41% with a turnout of 23.91%. Before the election Novinsky had stated he would join the Party of Regions if he won.
Repeat elections in constituency 133 (Odessa).
On 12 September 2013 the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine (under a lawsuit lodged by Yuriy Karmazin) ruled it impossible to reliably establish the results of the 28 October 2012 elections in single-mandate constituency No. 133 (in Odessa), at the time Ihor Markov had been declared winner of that constituency. The court overturned the Central Election Commission (CEC) decision of 23 November 2012 regarding Markov’s registration as a People's Deputy of Ukraine and ordered the CEC to take measures to organize, prepare for and hold repeat elections in constituency No. 133.
Police officers had documented the use of pens with disappearing ink in at least 40 polling stations in constituency No. 133 on 28 October 2012.
Repeat elections in five constituencies of 15 December 2013.
The Central Election Commission of Ukraine finalized the vote count on 12 November 2012 but simultaneously ordered – on recommendation of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) – repeat elections in five troubled single-mandate constituencies where it could not establish results. Because of occurrences in these five constituencies. In February 2013 the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine ordered to hold (additional) new elections in 2 more districts after the court removed the mandates of two seats. On 5 September 2013 the Verkhovna Rada itself set the date of these 7 re-elections to 15 December 2013. Hence, before 15 December 2013 of the 450 seats in parliament 443 deputies have been elected. But eventually only repeat elections were held in 5 constituencies on 15 December 2013.
Campaign.
The Party of Regions' campaign focused heavily on promoting its record as the ruling party, contrasting the "stability" of the (then current) Azarov Government with "chaos" during the Second Tymoshenko Government in 2007–10 (which it referred to as: "the chaos and ruins of 5 years of orange leadership"). It advocated a "balanced" approach to developing relations with Russia and the West, saying neither should be given priority over the other.
Fatherland tried to paint the election as a battle of good against evil and pledged to impeach President Viktor Yanukovych. The party stated it advocated "European values" and promised to reverse the Azarov Government policy of raising the status of the Russian language.
UDAR avoided sensitive and polarising subjects and focused instead on popular topics, such as more empowerment to ordinary Ukrainians and a ruthless campaign against corruption, the indifference of the authorities, the lack of local governance, inequality and poverty.
Svoboda softened their rhetoric in the campaign but nevertheless promised to shake up the country's political status quo.
One of the biggest spenders of the campaign was the party Ukraine – Forward!. One of their election billboards claimed that “an average wage of EUR€1,000 and a pension of €500” was realistic for Ukraine (the monthly average wage was €300 at the time).
Many candidates in single-seat constituencies tended to focus on local issues, often distancing themselves from party agendas.
Overall the election programs of the major parties bared many similarities; all pledged reforms to spur economic growth, higher wages, pensions and other benefits, better education and medical care.
Two weeks before the (28 October) election UDAR withdrew 26 of its candidates running in single-member constituencies in favour of Fatherland candidates and they withdrew 26 parliamentary candidates in favor of UDAR in an attempt to maximise votes for the opposition.
Costs.
Political parties spent more than US$75 million on the election campaign in multi-member constituencies (according to the parties' official reports). The Party of Regions spent about US$27 million, Fatherland more than $13 million, UDAR more than $4 million, the Communist Party of Ukraine $9 million, Our Ukraine $8 million and Ukraine – Forward! $7.6 million. Svoboda claimed it had spend US$3 million on the campaign. The Ukraine of the Future did not spend anything on campaigning yet still managed to take the 15th spot amongst the 21 parties who participated in the nation-wide list with 0.18% of the votes.
Denys Kovrizhenko of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems – Ukraine stated the sum of money spend could be up to 10 times more than what parties report afterwards. According to OPORA “In general, candidates spend about three times more than they officially report to spend”. Political scientist Artem Bidenko estimated other figures; he believed that the Party of Regions had spent around $850 million, Ukraine – Forward some $150 million, and the election campaigns of the rest of the political parties $350 million, while candidates in majority constituencies had spent some $900 million on the election campaign. About half of the single-constituency candidates submitted reports about their campaign spending.
In October 2008 Ukrainian experts estimated that a small political party who wants to win seats in parliament would spend up to US$30 million on the campaign and large political parties would spend up to $100 million. Political analyst Pavlo Bulhak stated then that a party's election budget will be spent on advertising on television, bribing voters, organizing rallies and party propaganda.
Results.
On 8 November the Central Election Commission of Ukraine completed and released all results of the nation wide party list the constituencies (the elections took place on 28 October). Meanwhile the Central Election Commission refused to establish the election results for the first-past-post results in 5 constituencies.
Several lawmakers elected into the new parliament have family ties with other lawmakers or other family members in the executive branch of Ukrainian politics.
Turnout.
The total voter turnout in the election was 57.99%; about average for parliamentary elections in Ukraine. On election day turnout had reached 22.43% by noon local time. The number of reported participating voters varied somewhere between 20.76 million and 20.78 million, while the number of invalid ballots accumulated to about 1.2 million (5.74%) for party list voting and voting at districts.
The lowest turnout was in Crimea (with 49.46%), the highest in Lviv Oblast (67.13%). Local disparities in turnout did occur: for example, the voting turnout figures in two adjacent districts in Donetsk were 39.8% and 84.5%.
Forming of new government.
On 9 December President Viktor Yanukovych nominated Mykola Azarov for a new term as Prime Minister. This nomination was approved by parliament on 13 December 2012. 252 deputies of the 450 deputies supported the nomination; the whole factions of Party of Regions (210 deputies) and Communist Party (32 deputies) and ten independent deputies.
The second Azarov Government was appointed by Yanukovych on 24 December 2012.
Reactions.
Fatherland, UDAR and Svoboda stated 12 November they did not recognize the results and will challenge them in local and international courts. In a joint statement the three parties vowed to work towards the impeachment of President Viktor Yanukovych, the resignation of the Azarov Government and chief prosecutor Viktor Pshonka, and the release from jail of Yulia Tymoshenko "and other political prisoners".
Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and President Yanukovych praised the elections; Azarov claimed “neither democratic norms nor legal democratic procedures were in fact violated” and according to Yanukovych the elections "took place well from the technical viewpoint".
Party leader Petro Symonenko of the Communist Party of Ukraine believed on 8 November that the new parliament could not work better than the present one, as "there will be a confrontation between the financial, political and clan groups who got seats in the new parliament." He also stated then that his party will not form any coalition with other groups in the new parliament.
Civil movement "Chesno" stated on 5 December 2012 that 331 out of the 450 deputies elected on 28 October fell short of its criteria for honesty; according to "Chesno"'s parameters, 114 of them violated the rights and freedoms of citizens, 30 earlier changed their political position while working in parliament or on local councils, 233 had been involved in corrupt practices, 185 had nontransparent incomes and expenses, 156 did not personally take part in voting in previous parliaments, and 101 had shirked work in parliament.
Party of Regions politician Sergei Tigipko stated in December 2012 "the parliamentary elections showed that politics in Ukraine is becoming more ideological".
International observers.
On election day (28 October) there were 3,500 accredited foreign observers. The observers from the European Academy for Elections Observation (most of whom where European Parliament members), stated it was "a good election, not perfect but clearly acceptable", and that it was "in compliance with democratic norms". On 29 October the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) (who had monitored the election with 600 observers) stated in a preliminary report that "certain aspects of the pre-election period constituted a step backwards compared with recent national elections" and that the election was marred by "the abuse of power and the excessive role of money". It complained of "a lack of a level playing field, caused primarily by the abuse of administrative resources, lack of transparency of campaign and party financing, and lack of balanced media coverage". This contrasted sharply with the international observers' conclusions on Ukraine's February 2010 presidential election, judged then to have been transparent, unbiased and an "impressive display" of democracy.
Ten thousand foreign observers where expected to observe the elections. Some 100 long term observers from OSCE member states arrived in Ukraine starting from the middle of September 2012, followed by 600 short-term observers who will arrive a week before the elections to monitor the election process at voting stations.
Poland is to send observers to Ukraine to monitor the elections, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski stated on 8 February 2012. German Ambassador to Ukraine Hans-Jurgen Heimsoeth stated "Germany is planning to send a numerous group of official supervisors" on 13 March 2012.
The total number of registered observers on October 9, was 1053 persons. The largest mission of international observers from CIS-EMO was 197 people.
On 2 October 2012 CIS-EMO observers presented the Interim report of the CIS-EMO Election Monitoring Mission. The report, in particular, noted that "The majority of detected violations are connected not with a political struggle of party lists but with the struggle of single-seat candidates". An impression that “antidemocratic power” clash with “democratic opposition” imposed by European and world society has a very relative nature that, as a rule, doesn’t distinct the real situation. In nowadays Ukrainian “peripheral capitalism” model such classes as “power” and “opposition” are conventionality. When the “Power Elite” is unconsolidated and disconnected and there is an open internal war between leading financial-industrial groups and corporations of Ukraine to get leverage of real state authority, all existing political parties only play the role of institutionalized political framework of realization of oligarchs’ economic interests.
On 5 October 2012 the CIS-EMO report was presented at the annual meeting of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Shortly before the presentation of CIS-EMO interim report web-site of CIS-EMO had been subjected to a massive DDoS-attack. The report was published on the official website of the OSCE in English and Ukrainian and also in Russian.
The ENEMO (Еuropean Network of Election Monitoring Organizations) mission for the 2012 parliamentary elections in Ukraine began its work on 23 July 2012 with the arrival of four Core Team members. ENEMO is the first international election observation mission registered for the Parliamentary Elections 2012 by the Central Election Commission (CEC). 35 LTOs (long-term observers) arrived to Kyiv on 5 August 2012 and were deployed throughout Ukraine. Long-term observer teams cover one or two oblasts of Ukraine. On E-day, October 28, ENEMO deployed 43 STO (Short-term observer) teams throughout all oblasts of Ukraine.
Factions in parliament after elections.
According to the amendment to parliamentary regulations adopted in November 2012, the smallest faction of parliament can be formed out a party with the smallest number of deputies elected by a party list and a single constituency vote. That amendment to regulations can also be interpreted as "either or" meaning that the smallest faction can be formed either based on party list or a single constituency election. In that case the smaller parties' deputies that were elected to the parliament will be able to form factions of their own, making it more challenging to form a coalition in the Ukrainian parliament.
On 27 November 2012 Party of Regions parliamentary leader Oleksandr Yefremov claimed that 223 members of the Verkhovna Rada had already expressed their desire to work in his party's fraction; according to earlier press reports 38 of the 43 unaffiliated politicians elected into parliament would join the Party of Regions faction. 
Removing deputies from parliament after 2012 election.
Since 8 February 2013 four parliamentarians have been deprived of their mandate by the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine.
Registered parties.
In contrast with the 2007 parliamentary elections, candidates in this election could be elected on party lists or through self-nomination. There were 87 parties registered for the elections to compete in electoral districts. For the nation-wide list the voters could choose between 22 parties. Several parties united together under "umbrella" parties. For example the election list of All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland" included members of Reforms and Order Party, People's Movement of Ukraine, Front of Changes, For Ukraine, People's Self-Defense, Civil Position and Social Christian Party. This electoral list was the result of negotiations within the opposition Dictatorship Resistance Committee.
Nation-wide list.
The Central Election Commission of Ukraine had registered 22 parties who would participate on the nation-wide list. On 15 October 2012 Ukrainian Platform "Assembly" withdrew itself from the national list (it had received ballot number 1) but the other ballot numbers did not change. So the ballot numbers where:
Public opinion polls.
Note that on 17 November 2011 the Ukrainian Parliament approved an election law under which 225 members of Parliament would be elected under party lists and 225 would be winners of constituencies. Simultaneously the option to vote "Against all" had been made defunct; furthermore candidates could be elected on party lists or through self-nomination.

Geauga County Courthouse

The Geauga County Courthouse is located at 100 Short Court Street in Chardon, Ohio. The courthouse was listed on the National Register in 1974 as part of the Chardon Courthouse Square District.
History.
Geauga County was established in 1806, settled initially by migrants primarily from New York and New England, part of the northern tier of culture and politics. It was carved out of Trumbull County. The county seat was first placed at New Market, where a courthouse was built. The records about this first courthouse are inconsistent and little is known about it. 
The next year, the country seat was reassigned to Chardon. 
Chardon quickly constructed a courthouse, which was completed in 1808. The one-room, log structure with chimney was completely outfitted with wooden amenities. It had split-log benches, rough wood floors and a stick chimney. This courthouse served the county until 1813, when officials agreed a new and sturdier building was needed. 
The county arranged a competition for the new courthouse. The third courthouse was designed by Samuel King for $750 and was built of brick. The details are vague, as the records are conflicting. Some of its details are enmeshed in the records of the 1826 courthouse. 
The 1826 Greek Revival courthouse was built of brick, and rose two-stories high on a rectangular foundation. Long windows lined the sides of the building and featured a Doric columned portico. The hipped roof was pierced by a cupola topped by a spire. In 1848, the building was adapted for use also as the new Chardon Library, the first branch of today's Geauga County Public Library. 
In July 1868 a massive fire broke out in downtown, destroying the courthouse and almost every other building along Main Street. Fortunately for the county, none of its important records was lost. Arson was suspected but never proven. 
The county soon ran a competition for the design of its fourth courthouse. The design chosen was by Joseph Ireland. The construction contract was awarded to L.J. Randall. The brick and stone structure was built at a price of $88,862. The courthouse standing today is basically the same, although renovations have added some minor interior alterations and upgrades.
Exterior.
The courthouse features red brick exterior with light sandstone quoins. The building contains a central projection, also framed by quions. The windows on the first floor are low arched windows on either side of the projection. The second-floor windows are interesting as the windows contain long arched windows with circular windows above with smaller circular tracings. The whole window is framed by a sandstone casing and white wooden trim. The flat roof rests on an entablature with decorative brackets.
The tower consists of an octagonal louvered cupola and a dome with four teardrop shaped clock faces and a weathervane topping the central spire. The entrance contains double doors topped by a fanlight. Above the door is a balcony lined with wrought iron railings. A central window is located in the middle of the tower with two long arched windows, each topped with circular windows like the ones above the second floor windows. The entire building, base to weathervane is tall.
In 1974 the courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as part of the Chardon Courthouse Square District.

Fractional coordinates

In crystallography, a fractional coordinate system is a coordinate system in which the edges of the unit cell are used as the basic vectors to describe the positions of atomic nuclei. The unit cell is a parallelepiped defined by the lengths of its edges a, b, c and angles between them α, β, γ as shown in the figure below.
Conversion to cartesian coordinates.
If the fractional coordinate system has the same origin as the cartesian coordinate system, the a-axis is collinear with the x-axis, and the b-axis lies in the xy-plane, fractional coordinates can be converted to cartesian coordinates through the following transformation matrix:
where formula_2 is the volume of a unit parallelepiped defined as

Lombard regional election, 1995

The Lombard regional election of 1995 took place on 23 April 1995. The 6th term of the Regional Council was chosen.
For the first time the President of the Region was directly elected by the people, although the election was not yet binding and the President-elect could have been replaced during the term. 
Roberto Formigoni (United Christian Democrats, then Forza Italia) was elected President of the Region, defeating Diego Masi (Pact of Democrats) and Francesco Speroni (Lega Nord).
Electoral law.
Lombardy used for the first time the national "Tatarella Law" to elect its Council. Sixty-four councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists; remained seats and votes are grouped at regional level where a Hare quota is used, and then distributed to provincial party lists.
Sixteen councillors are elected at-large using a general ticket: parties are grouped in alliances, and the alliance which receives a plurality of votes elects all its candidates, its leader becoming the President of Lombardy. If an alliance wins more than 60% of votes, only 8 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 72; if the winning alliance receives less than 50% of votes, special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.
Council apportionment.
According to the official 1991 Italian census, the 64 Council seats which must be covered by proportional representation were so distributed between Lombard provinces.
The allocation is not fixed. Remaining seats and votes after proportional distribution, are all grouped at regional level and divided by party lists. The consequent division of these seats at provincial level usually change the original apportionment. Only 41 seats were directly assigned at provincial level, and the final distribution between provinces changed in this way.
As it can be seen, the simple plurality victory of the Pole of Freedoms caused the distribution of ten more seats to the President's majority at provincial level. Brescia and Como and Pavia received two new seats, Bergamo and Lodi and Milan and Varese one each.
Results.
In the context of the profound political changes that invested Italy between 1992 and 1994, Italian Parliament changed the regional electoral law, adapting them to new majoritarian principle now in vogue in the country, trim and tend bipolar politics. The new political geography, however, did not fit properly to Lombardy where, besides a garrison of far left, assumed significant importance the presence of Umberto Bossi's Northern League, during the previous five years had not made any secret to aim the conquest of the Regional Presidency as a key step for a transformation of Italy in a federal state. In addition to the League, however, another major innovation had originated in Lombardy in 1994: the descent into the political field of Silvio Berlusconi, who by its movement Forza Italia had collected anti-Communist orphans of deceased traditional parties. 
The central political alliances had not been followed up at Lombardy, with the League in sharp contrast with Forza Italia, not only for connecting the latter with the newly formed training nationalist and post-fascist of National Alliance, but mainly because the entrance into the political arena of Forza Italia, accused by the League to be the "trojan horse" for the recycling of the old political class, had led to the arrest of the Northern League's electoral steady ascent - which had previously yielded the capture of the City of Milan in 1993 - if not also a marked reflux into the consent of the federalist party. 
Election on April 23 saw the success of the broad coalition of rightist Berlusconi, grouping conservative ex-Democrats, ex-socialist, liberals and post-fascist, and led to presidency Communion and Liberation's Roberto Formigoni that, with the majority premium, was able to give life to the first council in the history of the region that managed to last the entire legislature. They left much to be defeated forces of the left, but especially those of the League, whose disappointment was not alien to the radicalization which went towards the program of the movement in next year's national election.

Hordes of Chaos (album)

Hordes of Chaos is the twelfth studio album by German thrash metal band Kreator. It has been described as their most organic album to date because, barring vocals, guitar solos and some melodies, the album was recorded in a live setting on an analog tape recorder with few overdubs. Frontman Mille Petrozza noted that this was the first time they have recorded an album this way since "Pleasure to Kill" in 1986.
The album was released in three different formats. The standard edition was issued in a jewel case and features the 10 album tracks. A deluxe edition features a bonus DVD with a making of the album documentary. The LP version of the album has different artwork to the other versions.
This was the first Kreator album to chart in the United States, debuting at number 165 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, with first week sales of approximately 2,800 copies.
The album was re-released as the 'Ultra Riot' box set edition in mid-2010. It featured new artwork, extended liner notes, promo videos, a bonus disc with demo tracks and cover songs and various pieces of memorabilia (such as a photobook, sticker, poster and photo card).

Ensign O'Toole

"Ensign O'Toole" is a military comedy that aired on NBC from September 23, 1962, to May 5, 1963, with 31-year-old Dean Jones in the title role of a nonchalant United States Navy ensign during the early 1960s. Jones, born in 1931 in Alabama and a Navy veteran of the Korean War, played an officer aboard the fictional U.S. Navy destroyer USS "Appleby", which roamed the Pacific Ocean.
Cast.
"Appleby"s crew included:
Series background.
"Ensign O'Toole" was based on "All the Ships at Sea" and "Ensign O'Toole and Me", two books by William Lederer, who served as a consultant on the series. Though there was no second season of production, "Ensign O'Toole" was repeated on NBC through September 15, 1963, and ABC aired reruns of the show from March to September 1964.
The real-life U.S. Navy destroyer , which was launched on October 3, 1944 and commissioned on February 3, 1945, portrayed "Appleby". On June 3, 1969, "Frank E. Evans" was cut in half in a collision with the Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier HMAS "Melbourne" with the loss of 74 of her crew. Her bow sank almost immediately, and her stern was sunk as a target in Subic Bay in the Philippines.
"Ensign O'Toole" was aired opposite CBS's long-running "Lassie" at the 7 p.m. Eastern time slot on Sundays. ABC that season aired repeats of Robert Young's "Father Knows Best" in the same time slot.
After "Ensign O'Toole", Dean Jones starred in numerous Disney films from 1965 to 1977.
Selected episodes.
During her tour of duty, "Appleby" anchored in numerous ports: Hong Kong, South Korea, the Arctic, the South Pacific, and its home port, San Diego, California. The opening episode entitled "Operation Kowana" introduces the cast. The sailors are given shore leave with a stern warning to mind their behavior when they land in the Japanese port of Kowana. 
The second episode, "Operation Model T", which aired on September 30, 1962, Terence O'Toole buys a Model T on a French island in the South Pacific and camouflages it in pieces aboard the ship. After reaching California, O'Toole has the car reassembled, and an admiral, who is an antique car collector, sees it on the dock and thus foils the ensign's plans.
In the third episode, October 7, 1962, entitled "Operation Daddy", O'Toole has to assemble emergency leave papers for Seaman White, whose wife in Omaha, Nebraska, is about to give birth.
In "Operation Benefit" (October 14, 1962), while "Appleby" was in South Korea, Ensign O'Toole and the crew put on the "Foster Father's Follies" show to raise money to adopt Korean orphans. The Kim Sisters provided the entertainment. Dick Powell (1904–1963), owner of Four Star Television, which produced the series, guest starred in the episode. At the time of his appearance, Powell had fewer than three months to live.
Soupy Sales guest starred in "Operation Jinx" on October 21, 1962, as Seaman Jerome J. Johnson. Chief Nelson warns of trouble because Johnson is believed to be a bad-luck omen.
In "Operation Holdout" on October 28, 1962, the crew found four stranded soldiers, two American and two Japanese, who think World War II is still underway. 
Harry Morgan (1915–2011), later Colonel Sherman T. Potter on CBS's "M*A*S*H*", appeared in "Operation Mess" on November 18, 1962. O'Toole is puzzled why the crew is grumbling about the food when Charlie was previously known as a superior chef.
In "Operation Potomac" on December 9, 1962, with guest star Richard Eastham, O'Toole tries to determine why someone sent him a dress while the ship is in port near Washington, D.C. The unsolicited gift inspired lots of ribbing from his fellow crew members. Eventually, O'Toole learns the dress was for a female naval officer with the same name assigned to the same installation.
"Operation Gaslight" on December 16, 1962, featured Steve Franken, Chatsworth Osborne, Jr., in CBS's "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis", as Ensign Bender, a by-the-book sailor from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. O'Toole decides to "initiate" Bender by convincing him that he has contracted an unusual nautical disease.
In "Operation Swindle" on December 30, 1962, Rosemary De Camp, who played the sister of Bob Cummings in an earlier NBC comedy series, guest starred as a Southern belle who strips Chief Nelson of his bank book.
"Operation Intrigue" on January 13, 1963, is set in Hong Kong, then a British colony. O'Toole volunteered to help Scotland Yard find a jewel thief by going undercover.
"Operation Royalty" on January 27, 1963, offers Dennis Cross in the role of the "Captain of the Guard".
In "Operation Stowaway" on March 24, 1963, Nita Talbot appears as Grapunia, a young girl who stows away on the "Appleby", and the crew goes overboard to win her favor.
In "Operation Tubby" on April 14, 1963, Stubby Kaye (1918–1997) guest starred as Tubby Mason, a compulsive eater on the verge of being discharged from the Navy for obesity. He is ordered to go on a crash diet.
The final episode, "Operation Geisha", has Jack Carter as a con man who must return money to an irate victim. He and a partner open a reverse geisha house.

SIMBL

SIMBL (short for SIMple Bundle Loader, formerly Smart InputManager Bundle Loader, and pronounced like "symbol" or "cymbal"), is an application enhancement (InputManager bundle) loader for Mac OS X developed by Mike Solomon. It helps third-party developers modify and add functionality to applications developed with the Cocoa environment without access to the source code. SIMBL loads code via the InputManager system, which was developed to support foreign input methods. Plugins using SIMBL have advantages over normal InputManager modifications such as targeted code loading into specific applications. Designed for Solomon's PithHelmet, SIMBL is now used by other developers. The most popular use of SIMBL is to add functionality to the Apple Safari web browser which did not have an Apple-authorized plugin system until version 5 in 2010.
SIMBL was developed in response to the restrictive licensing and costs of Application Enhancer and the drawbacks of loading code blindly through the InputManager mechanism.
Installation.
SIMBL is installed like any other InputManager. As such, it is restricted to certain locations depending on the version of Mac OS X installed. In default installations, it is located in /Library/InputManagers. In versions of Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X Leopard, SIMBL could be installed per-user. In plugin installations, the SIMBL package is automatically installed. Since SIMBL injects code into running processes, plugins which are not properly debugged can cause process- or even systemwide problems.
Plugins.
Plugins for SIMBL are Cocoa bundles that add various functionality to Cocoa applications. They can be placed by the user manually through Finder or by an installer to /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins. It may also be placed in the user-specific home directories.
Advantages over InputManager Plugins.
SIMBL bundles may be disabled by removing the plugin and restarting the application. With normal InputManager hacks, the user must log out and log in. Also, the normal InputManager mechanism is loaded for all Cocoa applications, providing the possibility of incompatibility and unexpected application behavior. SIMBL only loads bundles for specific and identified applications.
Leopard restrictions on InputManager plugins mean their installation can only be done system-wide. SIMBL plugins may be installed per-user if SIMBL is installed system-wide.
Update Compatibility.
SIMBL plugins must specify which versions of the application that they will run with; running a more recent version of the application with the plugin activated will cause an error dialog to appear. Like all unsupported hacks, the amount of work required to update a plugin depends on the size of the update.
Development.
Development of SIMBL plugins require knowledge of Cocoa reverse-engineering. SIMBL works only with Cocoa applications, not Carbon or other kinds of applications.
No licensing payment is required to use SIMBL, unlike APE, although a donation is suggested. The source to SIMBL is also freely available.

Jerk (dance)

The jerk was a popular dance in the 1960s.
Description.
The jerk is similar to the monkey. The arms move and hands move as if conducting. The wrists cross in front of the chest and then sweep out in time, or at half time, with the music. The hands are up at face level. On count 1, the outward sweep, the hands are quickly pushed out, giving the jerky motion. For a little more style, the fingers may be snapped on the two outward movements—the first and third counts of the hand motion.
Songs featuring or suggesting the dance.
Released as a single in 1964 on the Money record label, "The Jerk" was a hit for the Los Angeles band the Larks. In the same year, the Miracles wrote and recorded "Come on Do the Jerk". The Capitols performed a 1966 hit song called "Cool Jerk", written to capitalize on the dance's popularity. The song has been covered by several bands, including the Go-Go's. The band Rocket from the Crypt recorded the song "When in Rome, Do the Jerk" in 1998 as a homage to the dance.
Bobby Fuller referenced this dance in his song, "Jenny Lee (Do The Jerk With Me)".
References in popular culture.
Hip hop performers the Sugarhill Gang mention that Tonto performs the dance in their 1981 hit song "".

Bangour railway station

Bangour railway station was a railway station in West Lothian, Scotland. It was located on a short branch of the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway.
History.
Opened to serve a hospital in 1905, the station did not survive to the 1923 Grouping, being closed by the North British Railway in 1921.
The Bangour Railway as it was known began with an east facing junction at Bangour Junction on the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway. The junction hosted several sidings, and was located where the A899 Livingston Spine road crosses the railway today. A station, with a single platform and two sidings existed at Dechmont. The line terminated near the present day boiler house in Bangour Village Hospital. The line carried all the supplies for the hospital, but quickly became redundant when road access improved throughout the area.
The line was funded by the Edinburgh and district Lunacy board, and was classed as a Private line.

Au nom de la rose

"Au Nom de la rose" is a 1999 song recorded by French singer Moos. The song was released on 13 April 1999 as the second single from his sole album "Le Crabe est érotique". It became a smash hit in France and Belgium (Wallonia) where it remained for several months atop of the singles chart.
Song information.
The song is a partly cover version in French-language of the Francis Lai song (Where Do I Begin?) Love Story, originally recorded as theme song for the 1970 movie "Love Story" directed by Arthur Hiller. Only the chorus is similar, and the lyrics are changed and deal with loss and love in a sensual way. The sound is mostly R&B. The lyrics were written by Moos, and Lai's music reworked by Moos and Pascal Castro. 
The song has been added to many French compilations such as "Hit Express 8", "Hit Connection - Best Of 1999" (released as the time of the song), and "Top 50 : 20 ans de tubes Vol. 1" (2007). It has also been included on "Hits de diamant", a best of containing big hits in France.
Chart performances.
In France, the song debuted at #6 on SNEP chart on 17 April 1999. It reached number one three weeks later and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. It remained for 17 weeks in the top ten, 23 weeks in the top 50 and 29 weeks in the top 100. It achieved Diamond status after about two months and half and was the third best-selling single of 1999.
The song is currently the 119th best-selling single of all time in France.
In Belgium (Wallonia), the song was very successful too: it started at #24 on the Ultratop 40 on 15 May 1999, climbed to #5 and eventually topped the chart for eight weeks, before dropping. It totaled 14 weeks in the top ten and 21 weeks in the top 40. The song was ranked #2 on the annual chart.

Thomas Francis Knox

Father Francis Knox (born as Thomas Francis Knox; 24 December 1822 – 20 March 1882, London
Knox, whose profile in the Dictionary of New Ulster Biography claims he was born in County Armagh, not Brussels, was an Anglo-Irish ultramontane Roman Catholic priest and author, known for his historical writings and translations.
Life.
Knox was the eldest son in a family connected to the Protestant Irish peerage: his father John Henry Knox, Tory MP for Newry, was a younger son of Thomas Knox, 1st Earl of Ranfurly. His mother was Mabella Josephine Needham, daughter of Francis Needham, 1st Earl of Kilmorey.
He was educated at a Hampshire private school and attended Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1845.
He became a Roman Catholic convert, in 1845 under the influence of Frederick William Faber. Encouraged to travel for two years by his concerned father, Knox hoped to see Mexico but was lucky to survive a shipwreck off Yucatán. Continuing to the United States, he decided to prepare for ordination in France. Invited to Rome for papal instruction by John Henry Newman in 1847, Knox proceeded as an Oratorian novice, taking Francis as his name in religion, as Father Francis Knox, with half a dozen priests. The rest of his life centred on the Oratorian group in England.
The group based at the Birmingham Oratory divided in April 1849. Together with Faber, Knox set up the London Oratory. The splitting up of the original Oratorian group was partly driven by personal difficulties, and in particular Newman’s attitude to Knox, who was proving troublesome. From 1865 to 1868 Knox served a term as superior of the London Oratory.
Knox has been called "the most learned of all the fathers of that time". He translated the autobiography of Henry Suso in 1865. In 1867 he defended a maximalist interpretation of the doctrine of Papal infallibility, though in a "dry and moderate tone". Appointed Westminster diocesan archivist when Cardinal Manning put the Oratorians in charge of the diocesan archives in 1876, he edited several volumes of English Catholic records.

The Ingersoll Lectures on Human Immortality

The Ingersoll Lectures is the name given to an annual series of lectures presented at Harvard University on the subject of immortality.
Endowment.
"The Ingersoll Lectureship" was founded as a result of a bequest by Miss Caroline Haskell Ingersoll, who died in 1893, leaving the sum of 5000 dollars for the institution of a series of lectures to be read annually in memory of her father, George Goldthwait Ingersoll. The lectures were to take place at the University of Harvard, on the subject of "the immortality of man".
The lectures were initiated by Harvard president Charles W. Eliot in 1896. They are now generally known as "The Ingersoll Lectures on Human Immortality".
The lectures were to be published.
From 1896 to 1912 they were issued by the Houghton Mifflin Company of Boston and New York. From 1914 to 1935 Harvard University Press published each lecture. Since then, the lectures have been published in the Harvard Divinity Bulletin.
