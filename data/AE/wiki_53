Air observer

An air observer is a military aircrew member whose duties are predominantly reconnaissance. The term originated in the First World War in the British Royal Flying Corps, and was maintained by its successor, the Royal Air Force. An air observer's brevet was a single wing with an O at the root.
The term is still used in some contexts now, such as police helicopter units.
The first recorded RAF "kill" of the Second World War, on 20 September 1939, was by air observer Sergeant F Letchford, aboard a Fairey Battle, flown by Flying Officer LH Baker.
Observers were also issued with weapons, and expected to engage with enemy aircraft in the early days of military aviation. Over time, the role changed and separate gunnery specialities emerged. By the Second World War the RAF commonly used the designation "air observer/navigator" in bomber crew.
Air observers were trained at the Air Observer Schools.
Fleet Air Arm.
Observer is still the term used in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (FAA) for most non-pilot aircrew officers. The term dates back to one of the original roles of aircraft at sea, in the big gun era, which was to observe fall of shot, and radio back gunnery correction to their ship. Thus the observer originally had to be a highly trained gunnery officer, often senior in rank to the pilot. Unusually, in the FAA, an observer could rise to squadron commander. Modern FAA anti-submarine and transport helicopters are still crewed by a pilot and observer, the observer being responsible for managing the detection and weapon systems - while the pilot does the flying, the observer "fights the aircraft" making the necessary tactical and navigational decisions.

Lobelia kalmii

Lobelia kalmii is a species of flowering plant with a distribution primarily across Canada and the northern United States in temperate and boreal regions. It was formerly known as "Lobelia strictiflora" (Rydb.) Lunell and has a variety of English names including "Kalm's lobelia", "Ontario lobelia" and "Brook lobelia".
Growth.
"Lobelia kalmii" is a small plant (10 – 40 cm) of wet environments such as bogs, wet meadows, and rocky shorelines, including wet alvars, where it grows in calcareous soil or cracks between limestone rocks.
It has blue flowers, with a white center. It has thin upper leaves and spatulate basal leaves. It starts flowering in July, lasting into September.
Cultivation and uses.
Although other species of Lobelia are cultivated for ornamental purposes, the small (1 cm) flowers of "Lobelia kalmii" have not endeared this plant to growers. It can be found though on seed exchanges among native plant enthusiasts. Its hardy nature may allow it to produce masses of scattered plants within downspout rock gardens.
Traditional use.
Native Americans used "Lobelia" to treat respiratory and muscle disorders, and as a purgative. The species used most commonly in modern herbalism is "Lobelia inflata" (Indian Tobacco).

WYLR

WYLR is a radio station in the Youngstown, Ohio market. Licensed to Hubbard, the station broadcasts an contemporary christian music CCM format on 101.9 FM from the Educational Media Foundation 24-hour national feed (K-LOVE).
The station signed on as a result of a construction permit issued in January 31, 1992 by Columbus atty. Percey Squire and local broadcaster Mr.Frankie 'Lucky" Halfacre who was the first Africian-American DJ in the greater Youngstown area who got his start on WNIO-1540 in the 1960s.
From 1998 until 2001, the station was operated by Jacor Communications and successor Clear Channel Communications via an LMA, making it a part of their extensive Youngstown/New Castle cluster of stations. The call letters were WBTJ, and sported a rhythmic top 40 format as "101.9 The Beat." Then-owner Stop 26/Riverbend took Clear Channel to court, complaining to the FCC that Clear Channel refused to preempt any of their programming upon Stop 26's request.
After settling in court, where Clear Channel paid a $25,000 fine to Stop 26 for unauthorized transfer of control of WBTJ, the "Beat" format was moved to the Sharpsville, PA-licensed 95.9 facility (where it became "Kiss FM" WAKZ), and WNIO's adult standards programming was briefly simulcast until Stop 26 could re-assume control of the station. When that happened, the WRBP call letters, which were used prior to Jacor/Clear Channel's LMA, were revived.
Stop 26/Riverbend declared bankruptcy in 2006, and Bernard Radio purchased almost all of their stations, including WRBP, WASN and WGFT.

Come down from a Premier League club. No big time about him. Harry Redknapp and Paul Hart speak ever so well of him. It's a pleasure to have him. He's got a smile on his face in training and loves being here." "

Meliá Hotels International

Meliá Hotels International, S.A. (formerly Sol Meliá) is a Spanish hotel chain which was founded by Don Gabriel Escarrer Juliá in 1956 in Palma de Mallorca. It is also known as and referred to by its former name of Sol Meliá. The company is one of Spain's largest domestic operators of holiday resorts and the 17th biggest hotel chain worldwide. Domestically in Spain the company is the market leader in both resort and urban hotels. Currently the hotel chain operates 350 hotels in 35 countries on 4 continents under the brands Meliá, Gran Meliá, ME by Meliá, Paradisus, Innside by Meliá, TRYP by Wyndham, Sol Hotels and Club Meliá.
History.
The origins of the company reach back to 1956, when the then-21-year-old Gabriel Escarrer Juliá leased the Altair Hotel in Palma, Majorca. Over the subsequent years Escarrer took advantage of the island's increasing popularity as a tourist destination for package holidaymakers, adding further properties to the portfolio of his company, Hoteles Mallorquines. The company expanded geographically in the 1960s and 70s, acquiring hotels in the Canaries as well as the other Balearic Islands. After the decline of General Franco's dictatorship, tourism in Spain developed more rapidly and Hoteles Mallorquines aggressively moved onto the Spanish mainland, establishing a presence in much of the country by the early 1980s.
In 1984 the company renamed itself Hoteles Sol (), before establishing itself as the largest hotel chain in the country with the acquisition of the 32 location-strong Hotasa group. Another merger followed three years later as the company combined with the upmarket Meliá chain to form Sol Meliá. The deal increased the geographical scope of the company into the Caribbean, Americas and other parts of Europe.
A 1996 split of the company into two separate businesses, one for hotel ownership (Inmotel) and another for management (Sol Meliá, which listed on the Bolsa de Madrid), was reversed three years later amid major consolidation in the industry. Gabriel Escarrer Sr. subsequently stepped down from the chief executive role, replaced by his sons Gabriel Jr. and Sebastian, who became deputy CEO. The following year brief takeover talks were held with Hilton International, but Sol Meliá instead chose to make an acquisition of its own, paying €360 million for smaller peer Tryp Hotels. Tryp had come close to being purchased by rival chain NH Hoteles a year earlier. Tryp continued to exist as a separate brand within the Sol Meliá group. Rights to the Tryp brand were sold to Wyndham Worldwide in 2010, but Sol Meliá continues to own and operate the hotels under a licensing agreement.
On 3 June 2011 the company changed its name to Meliá Hotels International.
The company has recently sought to forge partnerships with other companies in the leisure industry, opening hotels based on the Hard Rock Cafe concept in conjunction with then-parent The Rank Group, and Flintstones-themed hotels with Warner Bros.
Although publicly traded since 1996, the Escarrer family continues to control Meliá Hotels, holding a combined stake of over 63% at the end of 2010.
Operations.
The company employs various commercial brands to offer their product, including Gran Meliá, Meliá Hotels & Resorts, ME by Meliá, Innside, Sol Hotels, Paradisus Resorts and Club Meliá (formerly known as Sol Meliá Vacation Club). In 2010, they divested themselves of their Tryp Hotels brand when it was sold to Wyndham Hotels.
The firm operates more than 300 hotels as of April 2013, of which over 150 are in Spain. Of the other 230 countries in which Meliá Hotels International operates, the largest numbers of hotels are located in Cuba, Germany, Croatia, Brazil and Portugal.
Trademark dispute.
In late 2008, Hotel Meliá Inc. (HMI), a century-old family-owned hotel in Ponce, Puerto Rico, filed a complaint against Sol Meliá in the Court of First Instance after Sol Meliá attempted to register the name "Meliá" with the Puerto Rico Department of State aserting that Hotel Meliá Inc. "had the sole right to use the Meliá mark in connection with hotel and restaurant services throughout Puerto Rico." As a result Sol Meliá withdrew its application. But S.L. Dorpan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sol Meliá, subsequently filed a complaint against HMI in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, "seeking a declaration that under the Lanham Act, Dorpan had the right to use the mark Meliá throughout Puerto Rico" and that HMI had the right to use the name Meliá only in the city of Ponce. The District Court issued an opinion on 31 March 2012 ruling in favor of Sol Meliá. HMI then appealed the decision of the US District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. On 28 August 2013, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion vacating the lower district court's decision and ruling in favor of Ponce's local Hotel Meliá.
In 2013 Melia acquired the Sheraton Hotel in Nassau, The Bahamas.

Cheryl Bentyne

Cheryl Bentyne (born January 17, 1954 in Mount Vernon, Washington) is a Grammy-winning singer best known as a member of the vocal quartet The Manhattan Transfer.
Biography.
Born into a musical family, Bentyne started singing at age 13. At the encouragement of her mother she joined her father's Dixieland and swing band, performing weekends at the local Elks Lodge. She honed her stage skills and developed her jazz and swing-style singing. Following graduation from Mount Vernon High School, Bentyne enrolled at Skagit Valley College in Mount Vernon. After studying theatre and music there she moved south to Seattle. While in the Seattle area she joined the New Deal Rhythm Band as the only female and singer, playing in local clubs as well as in San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. After four years with the New Deal Rhythm Band, she set her eyes on a career in L.A.
The Manhattan Transfer.
Bentyne left Washington for Los Angeles, found a manager, and started playing local clubs. In 1978 she learned of an audition opportunity with The Manhattan Transfer, a group she had listened to and loved. The day after her audition, Bentyne was working at her daytime waitressing job when her manager phoned to inform her that she had passed the audition. Bentyne joined the group as the replacement for soprano Laurel Massé, who had been seriously injured in an automobile accident. Her professional recording debut was on the group's 1979 album, "Extensions" which won them their first Grammy for "Birdland", for "Best Jazz Fusion Performance". To date the group has won a total of 10 Grammys.
Bentyne later shared another Grammy with Bobby McFerrin for "Another Night in Tunisia” from the album "Vocalese", and received her own Grammy Award as the composer/writer of "Sassy".
Solo career.
While still a member of The Manhattan Transfer, Bentyne first ventured out as a solo act with her appearance on bassist Rob Wasserman’s "Duets" album. The following year she recorded "Back in Business", with Lorraine Feather and fellow Transfer member Janis Siegel in 1990 on the "Dick Tracy" film soundtrack. One year later in 1991, Bentyne collaborated with trumpeter/composer Mark Isham in the soundtrack to the 1991 Alan Rudolph film, "Mortal Thoughts". Then, in 1992, Bentyne released her debut solo album "Something Cool".
Current career.
Bentyne is still performing and recording with The Manhattan Transfer while maintaining her solo career. In 2000 she recorded and released an album from her musical revue based on the music and wit of Cole Porter, "Dreaming of Mister Porter". Her 2004 "Talk of the Town" album featured pianist Kenny Barron, saxophonist David “Fathead” Newman, flugelhornist Chuck Mangione, percussionist Don Alias and drummer Lewis Nash. Bentyne's 2005 album, "Let Me Off Uptown", is a tribute to Anita O’Day. While undergoing treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2011, she was replaced on stage with the Manhattan Transfer for eight months by the soprano Margaret Dorn. Ms. Dorn again replaced her in December 2013 while Bentyne underwent further treatment.

The Oxymoron

The Oxymoron is a student satirical magazine published anonymously by and for students of Oxford University. It takes the form of a spoof newspaper, similar to The Onion, though with a focus on events relevant to the life of an Oxford student. The magazine takes its name from the concept of an oxymoron, as well as being a reference to the word Oxon, used to identify an Oxford degree. It is published termly.
History.
The magazine was founded in Michaelmas term of 2007 and first published on November 17. Each issue from the second has been 8 pages in length; the first contained 4 pages. These are split between news satire, and spoof features. In contrast with the majority of student publications, it is printed without the names of the writers or editors, and these are not normally made public. Many previous Oxymoron editors have gone on to work as professional journalists and comedy writers. 
The Oxymoron has the largest Facebook group of any Oxford magazine or newspaper. Despite this popularity, the magazine has at times struggled to find funding - it carries few advertisements and seeks alternative funding through a combination of JCR subscriptions and charity comedy nights by acts such as the Oxford Revue.

Prince Francis, Count of Trapani

Francis of the Two Sicilies, Count of Trapani (Full Italian name: "Francesco di Paola Luigi Emanuele, Principe di Borbone delle Due Sicilie") (13 August 1827 – 24 September 1892) was a member of the House of the Two Sicilies.
Life.
Born in Naples, Francis was the youngest child and son of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and his second wife Maria Isabella of Spain. He received the title of Count of Trapani. He was three years old at the death of his father and the ascension of his brother Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies to the throne. As the youngest son in a large family, he was destined to follow a career in the church and was educated at the Jesuit college in Rome. His religious career was abandoned in 1844 when King Louis Philippe of France proposed to marry Francis to the young Queen Isabella II of Spain. She was three years younger than him and was both his cousin and his niece. The French ambassador to the Holy See who met the count of Trapani at this time described him unfavorably as " very ugly, small, of sickly appearance, without expression of intelligence; and when I remember in what condition of health I saw Queen Isabella during my stay in Spain (she suffered from an acute form of eczema), I cannot help thinking that at least from the physical point of view, they could choose better".
The Count of Trapani hesitated in putting forward his candidacy to marry Isabella II. His brother the Count of Aquila, his confessor, and the pro-Austrian party in Naples were all against the idea thinking that he would be an instrument in King Louis Philippe's hands and that the Queen of Spain could not bear children. However after a family council on June 17 1845, Trapani accepted marrying his niece under pressured by his brother Ferdinand II, his mother, and the French ambassador. However, he could not ask for the Queen's hand, she had to offer it. Spain's prime minister, Narvaez and Francis's sister Queen Maria Christina favor his candidacy. However after the fall of Narvaez government in April 1846 and facing the lack of support in Spain for the project, Maria Christina chose her nephew the Duke of Cadiz as a husband for her daughter in an agreement with King Louis Philippe. 
Four years later, on 10 April 1850, Francis married another niece, Archduchess Maria Isabella of Austria, Princess of Tuscany, daughter of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Princess Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies. Their union was unpopular in Tuscany as the Bourbon of Naples were disliked on political grounds. 
In spite of family intrigues, he was loyal to his brother Ferdinand II. Because he did not bother Ferdinand II with petitions, Francis was well liked by the king. Like his brothers, the Count of Syracuse and the Count of Aquila, Trapani had a weakness for women of easy virtue, but he did not get involve in scandals. At Ferdinand II's death on 22 May 1859, Trapani was entrusted with handling the army. During the short reign of his nephew King Francis II, Trapani, lacking in political acumen, provided him with little help in the critical time of the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicillies..
After the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies fell in 1861 during the Expedition of the Thousand, the royal family went into exile. Francis and his family went to Rome, where they were under the protection of Pope Pius IX. However, the Papal States were also invaded by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and Francis and his family fled next to France. Francis died in 1892 in Paris at 65 years of age.

Sub Arturo plebs

Text and contents.
"Sub Arturo plebs" is a composition in three voices ("tenor", "motetus" and "triplum"). Like all medieval motets, it has separate texts for each voice, which are sung simultaneously. All three texts are in Latin; the title under which the work is conventionally known in scholarship today consists of the opening words of each text. Their subject matter deals with music and musicians, following a tradition of similar "musician-motets" known from contemporary France. It includes a named reference to the composer of the work, making him one of the earliest named English composers, and a self-referential description of the work's own structure. 
The tenor text (together with its melody) is taken from an existing Gregorian chant: ""In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum, et in fines orbis terrae verba eorum"". This in turn is citing a verse from the Bible: ""Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words to the end of the world."" (Ps. 19.5 and Rom 10.18). The motetus and triplum texts are newly composed for this piece. Both are written in Latin rhyming stanzas.
The middle voice or motetus, which has six six-line stanzas, first contains the praise of a succession of biblical and historical figures, each of whom is credited with a founding role for music and composition: the biblical Jubal (here misspelled as ""Tubal""), the ancient philosophers Pythagoras and Boethius, Pope Gregory I, and the medieval music theorists Guido of Arezzo and Franco of Cologne. The fifth stanza then spells out a rule for the performance of the piece itself, describing its structural plan (see below for an in-depth analysis):
Finally, the last stanza of the motetus names the composer of the piece himself, "J. Alanus", who introduces himself as ""the humblest and most insignificant"" and prays for protection against envy:
The third, upmost voice (triplum), in nine five-line stanzas, describes the flourishing of musical art at the contemporary English royal court, and contains the praise of a series of named English musicians of the composer's own time or recent past (thus contrasting with the motetus and its emphasis on ancient figures). It names fourteen individuals, described as accomplished singers and composers, all apparently associated with the English court. Their Latinized names are: 
The first words of the text refer to a ruler under the legendary name of "Arturus" (i.e. Arthur), apparently an allusion to king Edward III (reigned 1327 – 1377), who liked to see his role as the founder of the Order of the Garter likened to that of the legendary Arthur. Another allusion to a "warlike prince" ("princeps bellicus") among the musicians' royal patrons can easily be decoded as a reference to the king's famous son, Edward, the Black Prince. Historians who have researched the list of names, as well as that of Johannes Alanus himself, have been able to trace several of these individuals in historical sources, indicating that they were in fact all employed as musicians in either the Chapel Royal under Edward III, or in the private household chapel of the Black Prince, some time during the middle of the 14th century. The composer himself, identified as one John Aleyn, can be traced as the holder of various church offices (""King's clerk"" at St. Paul's Cathedral, London, in 1361; a canon at Windsor, 1362; member of the Chapel Royal at least from 1364; died 1373).
Dating.
From various political allusions in the text, in connection with what is known about the named musicians, Brian Trowell and Ursula Günther have conjectured that the work was written for a specific historical event, the festivities at Windsor Castle on St. George's Day, 1358, when the knights of the Order of the Garter gathered to celebrate the English victory at the Battle of Poitiers two years earlier. Against this, Roger Bowers has proposed a dating somewhat later, in the early 1370s, i.e. the last years of life of John Aleyn. The earlier the dating, the more astonishing is the work on stylistic grounds, and the early dating has therefore been met with skepticism. The motet is characterised by a very significant structural innovation, the technique of multiple isorhtythmic diminution, which was to become a stock-in-trade technique of motet composition after 1400 but would be exceptionally innovative for 1358 or even still for 1370. Bowers comments on the idea that an English composer might have been the first to invent this technique:
Textual tradition.
The motet is known from three contemporary manuscript sources. One is Codex Chantilly, Musée Condé Ms. 564 (olim 1047), probably an Italian copy written after 1400, of a French original compiled around 1395. This codex contains 99 polyphonic chansons and 13 motets from the repertoire of the French "Ars nova" and "Ars subtilior". It has been linked to the court of Gaston III of Foix-Béarn, count of Foix. The presence of an English piece in this otherwise French collection has been explained through contacts between this court and neighbouring English possessions in France. The second source is Codex Bologna, Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale, Ms. Q 15, a collection that otherwise represents a somewhat later repertoire with many works from the early 15th century. A third manuscript was discovered in a private collection in the 1980s, in the form of a single sheet of music that was found bound into a 15th-century book.
Structural analysis.
Tenor structure.
"Sub arturo plebs" is a "pan-isorhythmic", three-part "diminution motet". As with all isorhythmic motets, its structural plan is defined by its tenor part, the foundational voice of the composition. It consists of a sequence of 24 notes taken from a pre-existing piece of Gregorian plainchant, used as a "cantus firmus". The source for this melody has been identified as a (slightly modified) piece from the first antiphon for the first nocturn of the commons for Apostles. The 24 notes are rhythmically defined as "longae" or "breves" in mensural notation, in such a way that, together with interspersed rests, they fill the time of 24 "longae". This sequence is divided in three "taleae", subsections measuring 8 "longae" each, each of which has the same repeated rhythmic sequence (hence the term "isorhythm"). 
[[Image:Sub Arturo (In omnem terram) isorhythmic tenor.svg|thumb|right|616px|Structural schema of the isorhythmic tenor.
Top: Underlying Gregorian chant melody.
Second staff: Tenor as notated in Mensural notation, with the three mensuration signs defining the pattern of threefold diminution
Staff 3–5: Tenor partially transcribed in modern notation. Each of the three repetitions of the tenor ("colores") is faster by a factor of 2/3; each "color" contains three "taleae" repeating the same rhythmic pattern. Only the beginning notes of each "talea" are shown here.]]
The structural innovation of the diminution motet is that the whole tenor line is repeated three times in a modified, diminished form (thus resulting in a total nine-part structure). With each repetition, it is performed faster by a factor of two thirds. In the system of late medieval mensural notation, this is achieved by applying three different mensuration rules to the three repetitions. 
This means that the length proportions of the tenor between the three repetitions is exactly 9:6:4. It is this rule that the motetum text describes with the words ""bis sub emiolii normis recitatur"". In the extant manuscripts, the scribes have provided additional indications for defining this canon. In the Chantilly manuscript, there is a repetition sign "]|[" after the tenor notes, with a rule spelled out in words as: ""Canon primo de tempore perfecto maioris, secundo de tempore imperfecto maioris, tertio de tempore imperfecto minoris"". A second scribe later added a second, slightly more wordy description of the same rule at the bottom of the page. In the Bologna manuscript, there is a repetition sign consisting of three vertical bars "|||", followed by the three standard mensuration signs written one over the other: a full circle with a dot in the middle, an empty circle, and an empty semicircle; in this case, the second repetition indicates "tempus perfectum cum prolatione minore".
Pan-isorhythm in the upper voices.
Isorhythm is present in the composition not only in the tenor, but also in the upper voices. However, these have isorhythmic repetitions only within each of the three main structural parts defined by the tenor repetitions, not across them. Inside each tenor repetition, each of the upper voices also repeats the same rhythmic pattern (but with a new melody) in each of the three "taleae". As is common with isorhythmic motets, the upper voices are generally paced much faster than the tenor, often moving in eighth notes or fourth notes (minims and semibreves in medieval notation) where the tenor moves in long notes filling whole bars. The text of each upper voice is distributed in such a way that each of the three main parts, despite their diminishing length in time, has the same amount of text to convey (i.e. two stanzas in the "motetus", three in the "triplum"). Thus, text declamation becomes progressively much faster towards the end of the composition, resulting in an overall effect of structural "accelerando".
The metric and rhythmic relations between the three voices are quite complex. The "triplum" moves in "tempus imperfectum cum prolatione maiore" (6/8 time) throughout, no matter what the current meter of the tenor is; this results in complex patterns of overlap and syncopation. The "motetus" is even more complex, as it shifts between meters multiple times. This is indicated in the notation by frequent use of "colaration", the use of note heads filled in in red to indicate that their temporal value is shortened to two thirds their nominal value.

USS Zeelandia (ID-2507)

USS "Zeelandia" (ID-2507) was a transport that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
The passenger ship "Zeelandia" was constructed in 1910 by A. Stephens and Sons, Ltd., at Glasgow, Scotland, in the United Kingdom. She was operated in transatlantic service by the Royal Dutch Lloyd lines until March 1918, when she was chartered by the U.S. Navy.
The ship was given Id. No. 2507 and placed in commission as USS "Zeelandia" at New York, New York, on 3 April 1918, Commander Robert Henderson in command.
Assigned to the Newport News Division of the Transport Force, "Zeelandia" carried troops across the Atlantic Ocean during the remaining months of World War I. She made five round-trip voyages to French ports between commissioning and the armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. During those voyages, she carried a total of 8,349 passengers — mostly troops — to Europe.
Though "Zeelandia" claimed to have sighted and engaged German U-boats on several occasions during her wartime service, only one encounter was verified as definitely a submarine. That event occurred at dusk on 31 August 1918, when a submarine surfaced to attack the convoy in which she cruised. The attacker, however, could not press home its attack because of zigzag tactics and a moderately strong escort.
"Zeelandia" remained in U.S. Navy service between 11 November 1918 and 31 July 1919, making seven voyages between Europe and the United States returning American troops home after the war. During those voyages, she repatriated 15,737 American soldiers and carried 3,170 passengers to Europe.
On 31 July 1919, "Zeelandia" was transferred to the custody of the Commandant, 3rd Naval District for disposal. She was finally decommissioned on 6 October 1919, was struck from the Navy List the same day, and was simultaneously returned to her owner.

DEPFA Bank plc is a Dublin-based German-Irish bank. It provides financial services to the public sector and also provides financing for larger infrastructure projects. The name derivates from "Deutsche Pfandbriefbank".
History.
DEPFA Bank was established in 1922 under auspices of the Prussian government, and was asked to provide financing for residential construction projects. Its more recent history began in 1950s, when the bank become a federally owned corporation, and was to provide for a wide range of residential mortgages. When the corporation lost its tax-free status in the 1970s, it entered the commercial lending industry, becoming the largest German underwriter of public covered bonds. The bank was privatized in 1990, and obtained a FSE listing in 1991. 
At the end of the 1990s, the bank went through a legal restructuring, which led the bank to move its headquarters to the IFSC in Dublin, Ireland. In 2002 the Irish government specifically legislated for it. Depfa Bank was purchased by German mortgage giant Hypo Real Estate a subsidiary of Bayerische Hypo- Und Vereinsbank AG in October 2007. The bank ran into liquidity problems in 2008 as a result of the economic and financial turmoil in the United States. At the same time banking supervision in Ireland was very weak, soon to be proved by the 2008–2010 Irish banking crisis.
DEPFA underwrote a group of municipal bonds in the U.S. that subsequently had their ratings downgraded. Under the terms of the underwriting, DEPFA was required to buy back the securities after downgrade in the ratings. Because of the difficulties in obtaining short-term funding in the markets at that time, Depfa's liquidity became a major concern.Through a series of bailouts, the German government ended up with 100% ownership of Depfa's parent company, Hypo Real Estate.

Nelson Act of 1889

An act for the relief and civilization of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota (51st-1st-Ex.Doc.247), commonly known as the Nelson Act of 1889, was a United States federal law intended to relocate all the Anishinaabe people in Minnesota to the White Earth Indian Reservation in the western part of the state, and to expropriate the vacated reservations for sale to European Americans. 
Approved by Congress on January 14, 1889, the Nelson Act was the equivalent for reservations in Minnesota to the Dawes Act of 1887, which had mandated allotting communal Indian lands to individual households in Indian Country, and selling the surplus. The goal of the Nelson Act was to consolidate Native Americans within the state of Minnesota on a western reservation, and, secondly, to encourage allotment of communal lands to individual households in order to encourage subsistence farming and assimilation. It reflected continuing tensions between whites and American Indians in the state. Especially after the Dakota Conflict of 1862, many Minnesota white residents were eager to consolidate the reservations, reduce the amount of land controlled by Indians and make the surplus available for sale and settlement by European Americans. 
Minnesota congressmen Knute Nelson pushed for the allotment of Ojibwe lands in Northern Minnesota and sale of "surplus" to non-Natives. He and others intended to force the Ojibwe to relinquish most of their reservation lands. The intention was to relocate the peoples to the westernmost White Earth Reservation. All would receive individual allotments, with the remainder to be available for sale to European Americans. These actions were illegal and violated the treaties which the US had made with the tribes, but the government proceeded anyway. The Red Lake Band of Chippewa were able to keep the southern portion of their Reservation adjacent to Red Lake.

Northern Pacific Depot (Hinckley, Minnesota)

The Northern Pacific Depot in Hinckley, Minnesota is a wood-framed depot built in 1895, the year after the previous depot was destroyed in the Great Hinckley Fire on September 1, 1894. The depot was built from the plans of the previous depot. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The building was originally built by the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad, which was acquired by the Northern Pacific Railway in 1900. The Northern Pacific operated the depot until the mid-1960s. The building had separate men's and women's waiting rooms, a freight room, a restaurant known as the "Beanery", and a stationmaster's living quarters on the second floor.
The depot is now known as the Hinckley Fire Museum. The museum interprets the history of the fire that destroyed six towns and burned over . It also explains how the town was rebuilt and how the area shifted to agricultural use after the lumbering era ended.

St Austell Gulls

The St Austell Gulls were a speedway team which operated from 1949 until their closure in 1964 at the Cornish Stadium at Par, St Austell in Cornwall. In 1997 the team rode at the Clay Country Moto Parc until the club finally closed in 2000.
Early years.
1949-1954.
The Cornish Stadium took two years to build but once in place works started on the track which was designed by famous riders Jack Parker, Vic Duggan and Bill Kitchen.
In 1949 the track operated under an open licence but ran a series of meetings under the team names, the St Austell Pixies and St Austell Badgers before finally settling on the Gulls nickname.
In 1950 the Gulls entered National League Division Three and competed again in 1951. In 1952 they entered the Southern League, finishing bottom and again the following season but rising just the one place. Former West Ham Hammers and Harringay Racers star George Newton managed the team, having ridden for the Gulls in 1951. In 1954 the Southern League was disbanded. Without a league to race in, the Gulls applied to join the National League Division Two. However, the Speedway Control Board decided against giving the club a licence and the riders were reallocated.
1962-63.
League racing was not seen again at the stadium until 1963 when the Gulls entered the Provincial League, although the Neath Dragons did finish off their 1962 Provincial League fixtures at the stadium under promoter Trevor Redmond. Redmond promoted the Gulls in 1963 but it turned out to be their only season of league racing until 1997.
1997-2000.
In 1997 permission was give to build a track in a disused china clay pit. A small track was built with very basic facilities, the referee's control room was a converted caravan, which was replaced eventually by a double decker bus. The Gulls entered the Amateur League, which became the Conference League. 
The track was rather rutted as it bedded in but by the start of the 1998 season, the team of mainly local riders started to become a solid outfit. Future 2007 British Speedway Grand Prix winner Chris Harris made his League debut at just fifteen years of age. By then end of the season the team had completed the League Championship and Knockout Cup double. 
In 1999 the Gulls retained the Knockout Cup. The Gulls final season came in 2000 when it was becoming obvious the club was ready to join the Premier League. The current owners of the club felt that they could not take the club further and the track lease was handed over to another consortium who opened up in 2001 as the Trelawny Tigers.

José do Patrocínio

José Carlos do Patrocínio (October 9, 1854 — January 29, 1905) was a Brazilian writer, journalist, activist, orator and pharmacist. He founded and occupied the 21st chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1897 until his death in 1905.
Life.
José do Patrocínio was born in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, to João Carlos Monteiro, a vicar, and Justina do Espírito Santo, a young freed slave from the city of Elmina (Ghana).
After completing his primary studies, Do Patrocínio went to Rio de Janeiro, where he served as a bricklayer during the construction of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia. Getting interested in the Medicine area, he entered at the Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, graduating in Pharmacy 1874. However, Do Patrocínio could not find a home to live in after his graduation. A friend of his invited him to live in the neighborhood of São Cristóvão, where Do Patrocínio stayed at the house of a rich laird and captain named Emiliano Rosa Sena. Later entering to a Republican club, he met Quintino Bocaiuva, Lopes Trovão, Pardal Mallet, among others.
He soon fell in love with Sena's daughter, Maria Henriqueta, who he nicknamed "Bibi". Although Emiliano initially disapproved of the marriage, he later complied. Do Patrocínio married Bibi in 1879.
During this period, Do Patrocínio began his journalistic career. He founded, alongside Demerval da Fonseca, a journal named "Os Ferrões" ("The Stings"). Fonseca used the pen name Eurus Ferrão, while Do Patrocínio used Notus Ferrão.
In 1879, he became a contributing editor for the journal "Gazeta de Notícias", where he wrote articles under the pen name Prudhome.
In 1880 he founded an Abolitionist society alongside Joaquim Nabuco. He and its members (such as André Rebouças and Aristides Lobo) were famous for buying manumissions for slaves.
In 1885, invited by Francisco de Paula Ney, he travelled to Ceará, where he was very well received. He was also well received when returned to Campos dos Goytacazes, where he took his mother to Rio de Janeiro, for her burial. Famous personalities, such as Ruy Barbosa, Rodolfo Epifânio de Sousa Dantas, Campos Sales and Prudente de Morais, attended the burial.
In 1889, with the Brazilian Proclamation of the Republic, he was a member of the Revolta da Armada of 1892, being exiled in Cucuí, in Amazonas.
He died in 1905, during a speech in honor of Alberto Santos-Dumont, because of an hemoptysis.
Representations in popular culture.
Do Patrocínio was portrayed by Antonio Pitanga in the 1969 telenovel "Sangue do Meu Sangue", by Kadu Karneiro in its 1995 remake, by Valter Santos in the 1988 miniseries "Abolição" and by Maurício Gonçalves in the 1999 miniseries "Chiquinha Gonzaga".

Dicky Ralph (21 January 1908 - 5 October 1989) was a Welsh international rugby fly-half who played rugby union for Newport and rugby league with Leeds. He won six caps for Wales at rugby union and also represented his country at rugby league.
International career.
Ralph was first capped for Wales against France on February 28, 1931 under the captaincy of Jack Bassett. The game was a walk-over, with Wales winning 35-3, Ralph scored two tries of the seven scored by the Welsh team that day and unsurprisingly was reselected two weeks later to face Ireland. In a bruising encounter, Wales won at Ravenhill, with Ralph again on the score sheet, this time with a drop goal. Later that year he faced Bennie Osler's touring South African team twice, once with Newport, and then again in December as part of the Welsh team. Ralph appeared on the losing team on both occasions, though played some strong rugby during the international and his screw kicking on the day was excellent.
In the 1932 Home Nations Championship, Ralph was back in the squad, alongside his Newport team mate Jack Morley. Ralph played all three games, scoring against Ireland with a try and a drop goal. Ralph may have gained further caps, but switched codes to rugby league in 1933, joining Leeds. On 30 December 1933 Ralph played for the Wales rugby league team in an encounter with Australia, becoming a dual-code international.

Michael Tritter

Detective Michael Tritter is a recurring fictional character in the medical drama series "House", portrayed by David Morse. He is the main antagonist of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007. Tritter is a police detective, who tries to get Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum. After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers the doctor's Vicodin addiction. Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to rehab. When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for contempt of court, and finishing his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes House is not the drug addict he tried to make him out to be.
The character was created as somebody who could go "toe-to-toe" with House. Morse, who had never seen the show before, was unsure if he could portray the character and was not impressed after familiarizing himself with the show. The excited reaction of his friends to the acting opportunity finally convinced him to take the role. Initial critical responses to the character were mostly positive, but critics later felt that the seven-episode Tritter story arc became "boring"; however, Morse was praised for his portrayal and gained an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series Emmy Award nomination for his appearance in the episode "Finding Judas". Morse stated in a 2006 "TV Guide" interview that, although he had discussed it with writers of the show, bringing the character back on the show would be "practically impossible".
Storyline.
Tritter first appears in the episode "Fools for Love". His character is a police detective who suffers from a severe irritation in the area of his groin, which he believes to be caused by a sexually transmitted disease, and who becomes a patient of the walk-in clinic. Although House diagnoses Tritter with dry skin, a common side effect of the nicotine gum that Tritter is chewing, Tritter requests that a sample be tested. House declines on the grounds that he has already met this month's quota for indulging "stubborn idiots". After Tritter causes House to trip, the doctor feigns acquiescence, but insists he has to take Tritter's temperature rectally. After inserting the thermometer, House leaves the room, with no intention of returning. Tritter later complains about his treatment to House's boss, Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), saying that he would rather "beat the crap out of" House than sue him; however, House refuses to apologize. Later that night, Tritter pulls House over for a traffic violation and arrests him after finding unprescribed Vicodin pills in his pocket. Other charges brought up against House include resisting arrest and driving under the influence (DUI).
In the next episode, "Que Será Será", Tritter searches House's apartment and finds a large quantity of Vicodin pills and two apparently forged prescriptions that bear the name of House's friend James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). During "Son of Coma Guy" and "Whac-A-Mole", Tritter pressures Wilson and members of House's diagnostic team to testify against him, but they all refuse. In "Finding Judas", Cuddy finds Tritter spending his day off looking through the hospital's log for evidence against House. She accuses him of not having a life and "personalizing every slight". Tritter responds that "nobody the hospital is innocent", as everyone allows House to treat patients despite knowing of his Vicodin addiction and that it takes a police detective to uncover what the doctors are deliberately hiding. At the end of the episode, Wilson visits Tritter and indicates his willingness to testify.
In "Merry Little Christmas", Tritter and Wilson work out a deal to allow House to continue practicing medicine if he pleads guilty and spends two months in rehab. Meanwhile, House uses a dead patient's name to obtain Oxycodone pills as a Vicodin replacement drug. When he visits Tritter early the next morning to agree to the deal, Tritter says the deal is off, after going through the pharmacy's log and reading that House signed for a dead man's drugs.
In the final days leading up to House's court case, House realizes the severity of the situation and finally apologizes to Tritter (episode "Words and Deeds"). When Tritter refuses to accept the apology, House goes into rehab, putting on a show for Tritter and the judge, but Tritter cites his experiences with addicts as evidence House has not changed. The judge tells Tritter that she does not believe House to be the drug dealer that Tritter tried to show him to be and orders Tritter to move on. Just before the bailiff escorts House out of the courtroom, Tritter tells him: "Good luck. I hope I'm wrong about you."
Personality.
The main antagonist of the third season, Tritter is a "stubborn", "vengeful", and extremely determined police detective. According to David Morse, the offensive thermometer incident in "Fools for Love" made it easy for Tritter to stand up to House; as House's equal, Tritter "gets who House is on all levels and can really shake his foundation". Tritter's experiences with drug addicts color his view of House, and he becomes so morbidly obsessed with House that, according to executive producer Katie Jacobs, the story arc turns into "a battle of egos" between them. The character shows a manipulative streak when he forms a plan to coerce each member of House's team to testify separately in "Finding Judas". Robert Bianco of "USA Today" described Tritter as an initially "legitimately, if belligerently, aggrieved adversary" character who later morphs into "some kind of insane supercop, tearing his way through the hospital and the Constitution at will". In spite of his adversarial and manipulative acts, however, he maintains a very soft-spoken and even-keeled demeanor when dealing with people, especially House, in contrast to House's generally denigrating treatment of others.
Creation and casting.
The Tritter character was created as someone to go "toe-to-toe" with House. The producers envisioned a character with an inner strength, intelligence, and single-mindedness to match that of House. In 2006, "House" creator David Shore contacted actor David Morse, with whom he had previously worked on "Hack", for a guest-starring episode arc on the show. According to Ellen Gray of the "Philadelphia Daily News", Morse's earlier portrayals of "scary" cops (in "16 Blocks" and "Hack") helped him clinch the role.
Morse was unfamiliar with the show. After watching several "House" episodes, he was surprised that the show had a strong audience with " a total jerk" as the lead character. It was not until Morse told a few long-time friends about the job offer that their enthusiastic reaction convinced him to take the role. Katie Jacobs, executive producer of "House", was impressed by Morse's performance. In a 2006 "TV Guide" interview, Morse said that, although he discussed the possibility with "House" writers, it would be "practically impossible" to get the character to return in any later seasons.
Reception.
Initial responses to the character were mostly positive. Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" declared Tritter the best male villain of the fall of 2006. Lisa Edelstein, who portrays Lisa Cuddy on "House", named David Morse as one of her favorite "House" guest stars, saying that he did a great job portraying the character. Barbara Barnett from "Blog Critics Magazine" and Charles McGrath of "The New York Times" compared Tritter to Inspector Javert of "Les Misérables", and Alynda Wheat from "Entertainment Weekly" stated that Tritter annoyed House more than any other character, surpassing other antagonists such as Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), and Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston). "Variety"s Stuart Levine considered Tritter a "worthy foe" for House.
However, the continued character arc increasingly bored critics. Staci Krause of IGN found the first few episodes of Season 3, in which House recovers from being shot, more interesting. In a review of "Que Sera Sera", "Entertainment Weekly"s Michelle Kung noted that while David Morse is a fine actor, "his cop is so ridiculously one-note and revenge-bent that his scenes are often just excruciating to sit through". In a review for "Fools for Love", Sara Morrison of Television Without Pity doubted that Tritter's revenge on House was worth his time and aggravation, and later called the Tritter arc an "insane quest for ass-thermometer justice". "The Star-Ledger"s Alan Sepinwall stated that "pitting House against a comedy-impaired cop was both dull and not a fair fight".
The show's fans had shown dislike for other antagonists with multi-episode guest-starring arcs, and critics suspected that Tritter's character would receive similar disdain. The conclusion of the storyline, and Tritter's departure from the show, were described by "USA Today" critic Robert Bianco as a Christmas gift for fans of the show. Morse jokingly stated after his departure that various fans had told him of their hate for Tritter after what the character had done to Dr. House.
Morse, however, gained mainly positive responses to his portrayal of Tritter. "The Star-Ledger"s Alan Sepinwall called Morse a "superb actor", and Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" stated that Morse's "understated performance" made Tritter all the more scary. Zap2it's Daniel Fienberg regarded Morse as "one of our very best character actors". Cynthia Littleton of "Variety", who already considered Morse's work in "St. Elsewhere" Emmy-worthy, was glad that Morse's submission of the episode "Finding Judas" for a 2007 Emmy Awards consideration was accepted in the category of "Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series". The award eventually went to John Goodman for "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip".

Public transport bus service

Public transport bus services are generally based on regular operation of transit buses along a route calling at agreed bus stops according to a published public transport timetable.
History.
Origins.
While there are indications of experiments with public transport in Paris as early as 1662, there is evidence of a scheduled "bus route" from Market Street in Manchester to Pendleton in Salford UK which was started by John Greenwood in 1824.
Another claim for the first public transport system for general use originated in Nantes, France in 1826. Stanislas Baudry, a retired army officer who had built public baths using the surplus heat from his flour mill on the city's edge, set up a short route between the center of town and his baths. The service started on the Place du Commerce, outside the hat shop of a M. Omnès, who displayed the motto "Omnès Omnibus" (Latin for "everything for everybody" or "all for all") on his shopfront. When Baudry discovered that passengers were just as interested in getting off at intermediate points as in patronizing his baths, he changed the route's focus. His new "voiture omnibus" ("carriage for all") combined the functions of the hired hackney carriage with a stagecoach that travelled a predetermined route from inn to inn, carrying passengers and mail. His omnibus had wooden benches that ran down the sides of the vehicle; passengers entered from the rear.
In 1828, Baudry went to Paris where he founded a company under the name "Entreprise générale des omnibus de Paris", while his son Edmond Baudry founded two similar companies in Bordeaux and in Lyon.
A London newspaper reported on July 4, 1829 that "the new vehicle, called the "omnibus", commenced running this morning from Paddington to the City", operated by George Shillibeer.
The first omnibus service in New York began in 1829, when Abraham Brower, an entrepreneur who had organized volunteer fire companies, established a route along Broadway starting at Bowling Green. Other American cities soon followed suit: Philadelphia in 1831, Boston in 1835 and Baltimore in 1844. In most cases, the city governments granted a private company—generally a small stableman already in the livery or freight-hauling business—an exclusive franchise to operate public coaches along a specified route. In return, the company agreed to maintain certain minimum levels of service.
In 1832 the New York omnibus had a rival when the first trams, or streecars started operation along Bowery, which offered the excellent improvement in amenity of riding on smooth iron rails rather than clattering over granite setts, called "Belgian blocks". The streetcars were financed by John Mason, a wealthy banker, and built by an Irish-American contractor, John Stephenson. The Fifth Avenue Coach Company introduced electric buses to Fifth Avenue in New York in 1898.
In 1831, New Yorker Washington Irving remarked of Britain's Reform Act (finally passed in 1832): "The great reform omnibus moves but slowly." Steam buses emerged in the 1830s as competition to the horse-drawn buses.
The omnibus extended the reach of the emerging cities. The walk from the former village of Paddington to the business heart of London in the City was a long one, even for a young man in good condition. The omnibus thus offered the suburbs more access to the inner city. The omnibus encouraged urbanization. Socially, the omnibus put city-dwellers, even if for only half an hour, into previously-unheard-of physical intimacy with strangers, squeezing them together knee-to-knee. Only the very poor remained excluded. A new division in urban society now came to the fore, dividing those who kept carriages from those who did not. The idea of the ""carriage trade"", the folk who never set foot in the streets, who had goods brought out from the shops for their appraisal, has its origins in the omnibus crush.
Motorbus.
John D. Hertz founded the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company in 1923 and then sold a majority of shares to General Motors in 1925.
From the 1920s General Motors and others started buying up streetcar systems across the United States with a view to replacing them with buses in what became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal. This was accompanied by a continuing series of technical improvements: pneumatic "balloon" tires during the early 1920s, monocoque body construction in 1931, automatic transmission in 1936, diesel engines in 1936, 50+ passengers in 1948, and air suspension in 1953.
The arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955 for not giving up her seat to a white man on a public bus is considered one of the catalyst events of the African-American Civil Rights Movement of the United States.
Types of service.
Urban transport.
The names of different types of bus services vary according to local tradition or marketing, although services can be classified into basic types based on route length, frequency, purpose of use and type of bus used.
Long distance transport.
Long-distance coach services (US: Intercity bus line) are bus services operated over long distances between cities. These services can form the mainstay of the travel network in countries with poor railway infrastructure. Different coach operators may band together on a franchise or connecting basis to offer a branded network that covers large distances, such as Trailways and National Express. These networks can even operate internationally, such as Eurolines of Europe. Interurban bus services are primarily aimed at linking together one or more urban centres, and as such are often run as express services while travelling in the intermediate rural areas, or even only call at two terminal points as a long distance shuttle service. Some interurban services may be operated as high specification luxury services, using coaches, in order to compete with railways, or link areas not rail connected. Interurban services may often terminate in central bus stations rather than on street stops. Other interurban services may specifically call at intermediate villages and may use slower transit buses or dual purpose buses.
Flexible bus services.
Buses usually run to a fixed route and schedule, serving specified bus stops or bus stations. Some services may be semi-flexible in that they can vary where they stop on a fixed route by operating in a hail and ride manner. The route and schedule of some services may also be flexible to some degree. Historically, some share taxi services have operated as a form of flexible public bus service. Another flexible type of service is the Hong Kong red public light bus. Demand responsive transport (DRT) bus services are modern bus services designed to be more flexible than fixed route services. These will often, but not exclusively, use smaller minibus or midibuses, and will operate a flexible route set by passenger need, allowing the pre-booking of pick up points. Paratransit bus services are bus services designed to provide service for members of the public with mobility issues that mean they cannot use normal public services, usually either the disabled or elderly. Paratransit operates in a similar manner to DRT (and was historically the name used for DRT in the United States), but paratransit services typically require users to register or otherwise qualify to be allowed to use the services, whereas DRT is designed to be available to all. In some cases, DRT and paratransit services are combined and provided by the same operator.
Operation.
Scheduling.
Many public bus services are run to a specific timetable giving specific times of departure and arrival at waypoints along the route. These are often difficult to maintain in the event of traffic congestion, breakdowns, on/off bus incidents, road blockages or bad weather. Predictable effects such as morning and evening rush hour traffic are often accounted for in timetables using past experience of the effects, although this then prevents the opportunity for drafting a ‘clock face’ timetable where the time of a bus is predictable at any time through the day. Predictable short term increases in passenger numbers may be dealt with by providing “duplicate” buses, where two or more buses operate the same slot in the timetable. Unpredictable problems resulting in delays and gaps in the timetabled service may be dealt with by ‘turning’ a bus early before it reaches it terminus, so that it can fill a gap in the opposite direction, meaning any passengers on the turned bus need to disembark and continue on a following bus. Also, depending on the location of the bus depot, replacement buses may be dispatched from the depot to fill in other gaps, starting the timetable part way along the route.
There is a common cliché that people “wait all day, and then three come along at once”, in relation to a phenomenon where evenly timetabled bus services can develop a gap in service followed by buses turning up almost simultaneously. This occurs when the rush hour begins and numbers of passengers at a stop increases, increasing the loading time, and thus delay scheduled service. The following bus then catches up because it begins to be delayed less at stops due to fewer passengers waiting. This is called bus bunching.
Some services may have no specific departure times, the timetable giving the frequency of service on a route at particular phases of the day. This may be specified with departure times, but the over-riding factor is ensuring the regularity of buses arriving at stops. These are often the more frequent services, up to the busiest bus rapid transit schemes. For headway-based schemes, problems can be managed by changing speed, delaying at stops and leap-frogging a bus boarding at a stop.
Services may be strictly regulated in terms of level of adherence to timetables, and how often timetables may be changed. Operators and authorities may employ on street bus inspectors to monitor adherence in real time. Service operators often have a control room, or in the case of large operations, route controllers, who can monitor the level of service on routes and can take remedial action if problems occur. This was made easier with the technological advances of two way radio contact with drivers, and vehicle tracking systems.
Fixed infrastructure.
Bus services have led to the implementation of various types of infrastructure now common in many urban and suburban settings. The most prevalent example is the ubiquitous bus stop. Large interchanges have required the building of bus stations. In roads and streets, infrastructure for buses has resulted in modifications to the kerb line such as protrusions and indentations, and even special special kerb stones. Entire lanes or roads have been reserved for buses in bus lanes or busways. Bus fleets require large storage premises often located in urban areas, and may also make use of central works facilities.
Management.
The level and reliability of bus services is often dependant on the quality of the local road network and levels of traffic congestion, and the population density. Services may be organised on tightly regulated networks with restrictions on when and where services operate, while other services are operated on an ad hoc basis in the model of share taxis.
Increasingly, technology is being used to improve the information provided to bus users, with vehicle tracking technologies to assist with scheduling, and to achieve real time integration with passenger information systems that display service information at stops, inside buses, and to waiting passengers through personal mobile devices or text messaging.
Fare models.
Bus drivers may be required to conduct fare collection, inspect a travel pass or free travel pass, or oversee stored-value card debiting. This may require the fitting of equipment to the bus. Alternatively, this duty and equipment may be delegated to a conductor who rides on the bus. In other areas, public transport buses may operate on a zero-fare basis, or ticket validation may be through use of on-board/off-board proof-of-payment systems, checked by roving ticket controllers who board and alight buses at random.
In some competitive systems, an incumbent operator may introduce a “low cost unit” paying lower wages, in order to be able to offer lower fares, using older buses cascaded from a main fleet to also reduce costs. In some sectors, operators such as Megabus (both in the UK and in North America) have attempted to emulate the low cost airlines model in order to attract passengers through low fares, by offering no frills bus services.
Ownership.
Public transport bus operation is differentiated from other bus operation by the fact the owner or driver of a bus is employed by or contracted to an organisation whose main public duty or commercial interest is to provide a public transport service for passengers to turn up and use, rather than fulfilling private contracts between the bus operator and user. Public transport buses are operated as a common carrier under a contract of carriage between the passenger and the operator.
The owners of public transport buses may be the municipal authority or transit authority that operates them, or they may be owned by individuals or private companies who operate them on behalf of the authorities on a franchise or contract basis. Other buses may be run entirely as private concerns, either on an owner-driver basis, or as multi-national transport groups. Some countries have specifically deregulated their bus services, allowing private operators to provide public bus services. In this case, an authority may make up the shortfall in levels of private service provision by funding or operating ‘socially necessary’ services, such as early or late services, on the weekends, or less busy routes. Ownership/operation of public transport buses can also take the form of a charitable operation or not for profit social enterprises.
Larger operations may have fleets of thousands of vehicles. At its peak in the 1950s, the London Transport Executive owned a bus fleet of 8,000 buses, the largest in the world. Many small operators have only a few vehicles or a single bus owned by an owner driver.
Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation holds the Guinness world record of having largest fleet of buses with 22,555 buses.
Regulation.
In all cases in the developed world, public transport bus services are usually subject to some form of legal control in terms of vehicle safety standards and method of operation, and possibly the level of fares charged and routes operated.
Increasingly bus services are being made accessible, often in response to regulations and recommendations laid out in disability discrimination laws. This has resulted in the introduction of flexible bus services, and the introduction of Low-floor buses with features aimed at helping elderly, disabled or impaired passengers.

Zimbabwe African People's Union – Federal Party

The Zimbabwe African People's Union – Federal Party is a minor Zimbabwean political party, based in Matabeleland. ZAPU-FP split from Agrippa Madlela's ZAPU party, purportedly a revival of those members of ZAPU who had rejected the 1987 merger with ZANU-PF in January 2002, following ZAPU's decision not to contest the Zimbabwean presidential election, 2002 and amidst accusations that ZAPU-FP founder Paul Siwela had accepted payments from ZANU-PF to run in the election and thereby split the anti-Mugabe vote in Matabeleland.
ZAPU-FP has a federalist, Matabeleland-centric ideology similar to that of PUMA. Paul Siwela was expelled from the leadership of the party in January 2008 due to initiating unauthorised talks with PUMA with a view to forming an electoral coalition in the Zimbabwean elections of 2008. Secretary general Sikhumbuzo Dube claimed the role of acting president of ZAPU-FP in his stead and Siwela ultimately stood unsuccessfully for election as a candidate for the Federal Democratic Union. 
The party contested the Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2005 for the Zimbabwean Senate, gaining 213 votes (0.03%) contested the Zimbabwean House of Assembly in the Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2008 in Nketa, gaining 195 votes and the Senate election in Gwabalanda (Bulawayo), gaining 734 votes.
Along with three other minor opposition parties, ZAPU-FP is a member of the Zimbabwe Organisation of Opposition Political Parties.

List of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's characters

The following is a list of characters from the "Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's" anime series. Where appropriate, names from the original Japanese media are on the left while the English names are on the right. Character descriptions pertain to the original Japanese version of the series.
Signers.
Signers are people who bear the Mark of the Crimson Dragon, a deity worshiped by a pre-Incan civilization that defended the world from the Red Nova and the Earthbound Immortals with the help of the Signer Dragons, powerful dragons that have been turned into Duel Monsters cards that the current Signers now possess. Signers are chosen by the Crimson Dragon to protect the world from evil.
Antagonists.
Dark Signers.
Dark Signers are the antagonists of the second arc of the show, who fight against the Crimson Dragon and the Signers. Dark Signers are born when someone who has died (usually someone wanting revenge on a Signer) is resurrected by an Earthbound Immortal (Earthbound God in the Japanese version), evil entities imprisoned in the Nazca Lines by the Crimson Dragon. Infused with dark powers and possessing dark cards, the Dark Signers are able to form a barrier around their opponents, initiating a Shadow Duel where attacks from monsters cause real damage. Sometimes, if the Dark Signer is showing weakness or resistance, the Earthbound Immortal itself can take over the Dark Signer's body. Dark Signers have special cards called Dark Tuner Monsters that can summon Dark Synchro Monsters with a negative level. They also have an Earthbound Immortal, represented by their birthmarks. When summoned, these monsters sacrifice the souls of anyone caught within the Dark Signer's geoglyph (with the exception of the duelists, Signers, and anyone protected by a barrier emitted by a Signer's birthmark). Their common attribute is the ability to attack directly and not be chosen as a target, although some circumstances allow them to attack monsters and be attacked themselves. In the anime, they are unaffected by Spell and Trap cards.
There are also Dark Signer-like figures (called Shadow Drones in the dub) who are recruited and controlled by Roman's spiders. They only have access to Dark Tuner and Dark Synchro Monsters. When these Shadow Drones are defeated, their Mark of the Shadows and Deck disappear, and they lose their memories of being possessed. According to Goodwin, a true Dark Signer cannot be returned to normal, because they have already died. In addition, their duels end with the losing duelist being killed (in the dub, the loser is sent to the Netherworld). When a true Dark Signer is defeated, all the souls that were used for summoning their Earthbound Immortal are freed (this also seems to apply to non-Dark Signers who were defeated in Shadow Duels). After Goodwin and the King of the Netherworld are defeated, Goodwin and Roman pass on to the afterlife while Carly, Misty, and Devack are revived with no memory of their time as Dark Signers. Kalin is later shown to still remember his time as a Dark Signer, as well as Greiger. It is speculated that they kept their memories because, unlike the others, they willingly became Dark Signers.
Yliaster.
Originally led by Goodwin, was an organization of Star Guardians, who are said to bring peace to the world and worship the Crimson Dragon. Their true purpose, however, is to steer the world to change the future, which was destroyed by Dr Fudo's creation of Ener-D (Momentum in Japanese). In the third season, the founding Yliaster members come from the future with the purpose of setting things right. They hope to accomplish this by harnessing energy from Turbo Duels during the WRGP to power the Ark Cradle, which will be used to destroy Ener-D, and ultimately New Domino City and Satellite, and thus undo the calamity Ener-D had caused.
Duelists.
Fortune Cup.
The Fortune Cup is a tournament organized by Rex Goodwin with the purpose of awakening the powers of the Signers. The winner will be able to challenge Jack Atlas for the title of King. Along with Yusei, Akiza and Leo (disguised as Luna), there are other duelists whose jobs are to put pressure on their opponents in order to awaken their abilities (the exception is Hunter Pace, who replaced one of the combatants in order to beat Yusei).
World Racing Grand Prix.
The following are the competitors in the World Racing Grand Prix (World Riding Duel Grand Prix in Japanese version, WRGP for short) alongside Team 5D's and Yliaster's Team New World. Players battle in teams of up to three players, each with 4000 points per player. When one player's life points reach zero, the next player takes over until all players are eliminated.

Zwartbles

The Zwartbles is a breed of domestic sheep originating in the Friesland region of the north Netherlands. There it was primarily used for the production of sheep milk as well as lamb and mutton. They were often kept alongside dairy cattle herds.
Breed characteristics.
The Zwartbles has a striking appearance: a black/brown fleece, a white blaze on the face, 2 - 4 white socks, and a white tail tip (which is traditionally left undocked). Both rams and ewes are polled. 
The Zwartbles are relatively large sheep: ewes weigh an average of , and rams . 
The dense fleece ranges from black to brown with sun bleached tips, some silvering maybe present in older animals. The wool is medium to fine with excellent crimp and fibre length, a Bradford count of 54-56 and a micron count of 27 making it popular for spinning and felting.
Zwartbles are known for being docile, friendly, easy lambing, prolific, milky and being excellent mothers.
History.
Traditionally used for both milk and meat in the Netherlands, they declined significantly in use until listed as critically rare by the Dutch Rare Breed Survival trust in the mid-1970s. 
The first Zwartbles were imported to the United Kingdom in the early 1990s. The UK Zwartbles Sheep Association was formed in 1995.
In the UK.
Zwartbles are now mainly used to produce breeding stock, meat and wool. Being from a cold, wet, windy area of the Netherlands, the breed has easily adapted to the UK climate and can thrive at various altitudes. They are increasingly popular with both small holders and commercial farmers. As of June 2011 there are over 750 Zwartbles flocks registered with the UK breed society plus many unregistered flocks in the UK. 
In the UK, Zwartbles rams are also crossed with ewes of other breeds to produce butchers lambs. Lambs from these crosses are always black but sometimes will have a little white on the head. Zwartbles rams and ewes cross well with other breeds. Many UK agricultural shows now hold classes for Zwartbles. The wool of these show animals is often trimmed to remove the sunbleached (brown) wool tips revealing a tight black fleece.

Castro Laboreiro

Castro Laboreiro is a village in northern Portugal, one of the 18 parishes of the Melgaço munincipality, in the district of Viana do Castelo. It is in the mountain range of the Laboreiro. As of 2001 the area had 726 inhabitants. The name derives from "Castro", a hill fort, and "Lepporariu", "of hares", a Latin name from Roman times.
History and scenery.
There are many archaeological sites in the area that show evidence of very early human occupation.
Cascata do Laboreiro, a waterfall on the Homem River, can be seen from the walls of the ruin of the Castle of Castro Laboreiro, situated above the town.
Roman and medieval bridges are found nearby over the various rivers, including the Laboreiro River, Mire River, and others. 
For centuries, the domain passed back and forth between Christian and Muslim rulers. In 1141, D. Afonso Henriques (1112–1185) took control of the castle. In 1944, the castle was classified by the government as a National Monument.
The village also has a pre-Romanesque church, Santa Maria da Visitação, built in the 9th century. The Feast of Santa Maria da Visitação is held on July 6 each year.

Song information.
The song was originally written by Jim Steinman, Tony Hendra and Sean Kelly (and sung by Michael Simmons) for the short-lived television comedy series, "Delta House". Steinman reworked the melody into the song "Dead Ringer for Love" for the "Dead Ringer" album, while portions of the lyric would later appear in his "Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young" Cher also wrote the song but remains uncredited.
The song was performed many times by Loaf but never by Cher. There is no footage of Cher and Loaf ever performing this song live together, and Cher appeared only in the music video. 
The song performed by Loaf is available in two live CDs; "Live Around the World" and '. The song was also used in the Loaf's "Hits out of Hell" and in Cher's ' compilations. The song can also be found on Cher's album Essential Collection. 
The track was released in the United Kingdom in November 1981 and debuted at number 63 on the UK Singles Chart, it slowly climbed the chart and peaked at number five in early February 1982.
Allmusic editor William Ruhlmann highlighted the song. Also, Donald A. Guarisco praised the lyrics "The tongue-in-cheek lyrics tell the tale of a guy who’s realized he cant "live by rock ‘n’ roll and brew alone" and sets his sights on his ideal woman (...) The lyric devotes equal time to his vampy object of affection", and added that "This unique blend of vocal and instrumental firepower makes "Dead Ringer For Love" feel like a long-lost outtake from the Grease soundtrack on steroids."

Masahiro Makino

Career.
Masahiro Makino was born in Kyoto, the eldest son of the film director and producer Shōzō Makino, who is often called the father of Japanese cinema. As a boy he began acting in films before debuting as a film director in 1926 at age 18. His critically acclaimed nihilistic jidaigeki such as "Roningai" (1928) made him one of the top Japanese film directors, but his way of shooting films quickly also earned him detractors. For instance, the total time it took to shoot the 1936 film "Edo no Ka Oshō" was only 28 hours. The critic Sadao Yamane, however, has argued that this fast filming practice also contributed to Makino's speedy, rhythmic film style. Rhythm and tempo are important to his films, and so in his "jidaigeki", fight scenes like in "Kettō Takadanobaba" (1937) could seem like dances, or entire sequences, like in "Awa no Odoriko" (1941), could be filled with dance. He made musicals like "Singing Lovebirds" (1939) and even his wartime propaganda films like "Hanako-san" and "Ahen senso" (both 1943) could have Busby Berkeley-like musical numbers.
After the war, he helmed such popular "jidaigeki" series as "Jirōchō Sangokushi" and such ninkyō eiga series as "Nihon Kyōkaku-den". He directed his last film in 1972, the retirement film for Junko Fuji, completing a filmography that totaled over 260 films and included films of many genres.
Personal life.
Masahiro's half-brother, Sadatsugu Matsuda (1906–2003), was also a popular film director. Another brother, Mitsuo Makino, was an important film producer, and yet another, Shinzō Makino, also worked as a director (his wife was the actress Chikako Miyagi). Masahiro's sister, Tomoko Makino, married the actor Kunitarō Sawamura, and gave birth to the actors Masahiko Tsugawa and Hiroyuki Nagato, each of whom married famous actresses (Yukiji Asaoka and Yōko Minamida respectively). Kunitarō's brother and sister (brother and sister-in-law to Masahiro) are the actors Daisuke Katō and Sadako Sawamura. The pseudonym that Masahiko Tsugawa took when he became a director, Makino Masahiko, is a tribute to Masahiro.
Masahiro married the actress Yukiko Todoroki and their son, Masayuki Makino, is the head of the Okinawa Actor's School, famous for training a number of Japan's top female pop singers. His second wife was also an actress, and one of their two daughters became an actress.

Ark of Taste

The Ark of Taste is an international catalogue of endangered heritage foods which is maintained by the global Slow Food movement. The Ark is designed to preserve at-risk foods that are sustainably produced, unique in taste, and part of a distinct ecoregion. Contrary to the most literal definition of plant and animal conservation, the Ark of Taste aims to maintain edibles in its purview by actively encouraging their cultivation for consumption. By doing so, Slow Food hopes to promote the growing and eating of foods which are sustainable and preserve biodiversity in the human food chain.
Foods included in the list are intended to be "culturally or historically linked to a specific region, locality, ethnicity or traditional production practice", in addition to being rare. Which foods meet these criteria is decided by an adjudicating committee made up of members of the Slow Food non-profit organization; all candidates go through a formal nomination process which includes tastings and identification of producers within the region.
Since the foundation of the Ark in 1996, 800 products from over 50 countries have been included. The list includes not only prepared foods and food products, but a great many livestock breeds as well as vegetable and fruit cultivars. All foods in the catalogue are accompanied by a list of resources for those wishing to grow or buy them.

Carolina Girls

Carolina Girls is a song by General Norman Johnson of Chairmen of the Board. The song was recorded and released as a single in 1980 on the album Carolina Girl by Surfside Records. While never topping the charts, the song has persisted over the years to become a part of the South Carolina and North Carolina culture and remains a radio and live performance favorite. The song was later recorded by other artists, although not with the success of the original. The song also inspired the book "Carolina Girls" (ISBN 0-9712521-7-3) by Steven Brown.
In an interview with Blues Critic, Danny Woods of Chairman of the Board was asked if "Carolina girls really are the best" and explains: "You know when I first came here (The Carolinas) there was no style. You know you had the New York girls, California girls and they all got the attention. Even songs about them. And that just made Carolina girls feel like nothing but there's quite a difference between Carolina girls now and then. Their self esteem just magnified after that song."
Fellow Chairman Ken Knox followed up:
Girls became prideful. High schools and colleges use that song. Marching bands play "Carolina Girls". It's on T-shirts and we're glad about that. It's the all time biggest Carolina beach song now.

Irving Nattrass

Irving Nattrass (born 20 December 1952) was a midfielder for Newcastle and Middlesbrough
Born in Fishburn, England Nattrass attended Ferryhill Grammar School and Signed with Newcastle at age 16 on an apprenticeship. 
As a youth player Irving lacked confidence and made slow progress within the club, even going so far as to look for employment elsewhere as a mechanic, however he soon found his stride and went on to sign professionally for the club in July 1970 aged 17. A year later Irving went on to make his debut against Derby.
The then Newcastle manager Joe Harvey once commented "Nattrass is my Paul Madeley and I can't pay him a bigger compliment than that". Paul Madeley was a Leeds and England player who was dubbed the "Rolls Royce" of footballers.
Hampered by injuries and disagreements with the Newcastle board he eventually moved to Middlesbrough for the sum of £375,000. Nattrass made his league debut for them against Arsenal on 15 September 1979.
Nattrass is now a successful businessman and keen golfer.

Tall Story

Tall Story is a 1960 American romantic comedy film made by Warner Bros., directed by Joshua Logan and starring Anthony Perkins with Jane Fonda, in her first screen role, at the age of 22. It is based on the 1957 novel ""The Homecoming Game"" by Howard Nemerov, which was the basis of a successful 1959 Broadway play, called "Tall Story", by the writing team of Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. The film was a considerable departure from Logan's previous two projects, the drama "Sayonara", which won multiple Academy Awards, and the blockbuster "South Pacific".
"Tall Story" is a farcical social satire of American campus life, making fun of the way college life can become a marriage market for some students. Fonda portrays a character who is the complete opposite of the independent liberated woman she later personified.
Plot.
At Custer University, Ray Blent (Anthony Perkins) is an honor student and college basketball star. June Ryder (Jane Fonda) has come to the university to study home economics and to find a husband. Both students and faculty are scandalized by Ryder's unashamed pursuit of Blent. She joins the pom-pom girls and attends all the classes taken by Blent to ensure she has maximum contact with him. Everyone is aware of her designs on the sexually naive Blent, except for him. She succeeds in convincing him that she has an intelligent, inquiring mind that he admires, although this is all done through deception. She eventually gets Blent to fall for her and propose marriage. However, they need several thousand dollars to set up a home.
Blent is secretly propositioned, via a radio message, by a gambling syndicate to lose a key game with a visiting Russian team. He refuses to do this, but is unable to return the money as he does not know who is behind the bribe. Rather than deliberately throw the game, he decides to deliberately fail an ethics exam, which automatically disqualifies him from playing. He is the best student in class and the only way he can fail is by copying Ryder's paper. Too late he realizes that his not playing is tantamount to ensuring his team will lose, and that he has given the gamblers exactly what they want.
Meanwhile, his ethics professor, Leo Sullivan (Ray Walston), is coming under extreme student and faculty pressure to reverse the failure and give Blent a passing grade. He refuses to do this on principle, but finally consents to give Blent an oral retest while the game is in progress. Blent passes and plays for the last few minutes, achieving a one-point victory for the school.

Cast notes
Production.
The film's working title was "The Way the Ball Bounces". Producer/director Joshua Logan originally intended the film to be a vehicle for both Jane Fonda and Warren Beatty to make their screen debuts, but Warner Bros. would not approve the unknown Beatty for the part, and Logan had to settle for his second choice, Anthony Perkins. 
Fonda had hated the Broadway play, but was pleased that her part in the film script had been expanded. Logan was a good friend of her father, Henry Fonda, and saw Jane as a potential major star. We wanted to guide her through her first film experience – she had been modelling for several years – but Fonda found it a "Kafkaesque nightmare".
Campus scenes were filmed at Occidental College in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles California.
Reception.
On its release in 1960, the film was neither a commercial nor a critical success. "Time" magazine wrote "Nothing could possibly save the picture, not even the painfully personable Perkins doing his famous awkward act, not even a second-generation Fonda with a smile like her father's and legs like a chorus girl."

Katy Moffatt

Katherine Louella "Katy" Moffatt (born November 19, 1950) is an American musician, lyricist, composer, vocalist. She is the sister of country singer-songwriter Hugh Moffatt.
Midnight radio.
Moffatt became impassioned by music as a child growing up in Fort Worth, Texas. She was captivated by Broadway show tunes, the Beatles, and the Motown sound, and has said that she was such an avid listener to Top 40 radio that "I used to come home from school, have dinner, go to bed, and set the alarm for midnight. Then I'd get up and do my homework and listen to the radio. It was my favorite time – I could be alone with the music."
Early influences.
Moffatt points to the influence of the Beatles and the bands of the British Invasion as inspiring her to learn the guitar. She credits Leonard Cohen's "Dress Rehearsal Rag" for making her want to perform and says folk singers like Judy Collins, Phil Ochs, and Dave Van Ronk were her models. Ella Fitzgerald and the versatile vocalist, Tracy Nelson were also important influences.
Early life and career.
Moffatt was born in Fort Worth, Texas. She left Fort Worth to attend Tulane University in New Orleans but ended up studying at St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In Sante Fe, she developed a local following performing her songs at the College. Her local fame won her a part as a folk singer in Tom Laughlin's movie, "Billy Jack." In 1971, as an aspiring singer/songwriter, she moved to Denver, Colorado to find an audience in the growing musical community there. While working a regular cocktail hour gig at a Denver hotel, Moffatt met Mary Flower and Randy Handley and who, along with Lon Ephraim, formed a band called Flower, Handley, and Moffatt. The band developed a following and traveled all over the state performing. Eventually, Moffatt and Flower became a duo and toured on the national coffeehouse circuit.
Moffatt's frequent gigs as a solo performer at Ebbets Field, a prominent Denver music club, opened a door to the mainstream recording industry. From 1975 to 1979 she recorded for Columbia Records, making several singles and two albums – "Katy" (produced by Billy Sherrill) and "Kissin' in the California Sun".
On the road and recording career.
Coinciding with her recording at Columbia, Moffatt opened for such performers as Charlie Daniels, Warren Zevon, Muddy Waters, and Steve Martin, and she toured with Leo Kottke. She also worked with Willie Nelson and Andrew Gold, appeared with Poco and John Prine, and toured with Jerry Jeff Walker, J.D. Souther and the Allman Brothers. For a brief time in the early 1980s, while waiting out two management contracts, Moffatt was a sought-after and featured touring harmony and duet singer for four prominent acts.
With that music industry experience behind her, she returned to making records including recording several songs for the short-lived Permian record label that were released to country radio and pursued an ever-expansive solo artist's path. She began making records as she wanted them to be made and licensed several gems which became favorites and remain so within her body of work thus far, including "Walkin' On the Moon", "The Greatest Show on Earth" (aka "The Evangeline Hotel"), "Hearts Gone Wild", and "Angel Town".
Like many American singer/songwriters, Katy Moffatt is honored both abroad and in her own country. She regularly tours Europe and the U.K.

William de Beauchamp (1185)

William de Beauchamp (c.1185–1260) was a British judge and High Sheriff.
Early life.
Beauchamp was the son of Simon de Beauchamp (c.1145–1206/7) and his wife Isabella, whose parents are unknown.
Magna Carta baron.
de Beauchamp took part in the 1210 expedition to Ireland and the 1214 expedition to Poitiers before joining the rebellious barons in 1215 at the beginning of the First Barons' War, entertaining them at his seat of Bedford Castle; as such Beauchamp was one of the rebels excommunicated by Pope Innocent III.
Involvement in military actions.
de Beauchamp was captured at the Battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1217 but made his peace with the government; by this point he had already lost Bedford Castle to Falkes de Breauté in 1215, leading to an odd situation; Breauté was granted the castle, while Beauchamp held the barony. When Breaté fell from power Bedford Castle was sieged and partially destroyed on royal orders, but Beauchamp was granted licence to build a residence within its Bailey. He was part of a royal expedition ambushed by Richard Marshal in 1233, and was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer in 1234 and 1237.
Other offices.
He also served as Sheriff of Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire for 1236 and when Eleanor of Provence was crowned queen that year he served as an Almoner.
Family and death.
He died in 1260, leaving a son, also called William as well as five other children. His wife was Ida Longespee, daughter of William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury and Ela, Countess of Salisbury.

John Thornton Theatre

The John Thornton Theatre is a playhouse located in Georgetown, Ontario, Canada. It was the first theatre to be founded in Georgetown. The theatre itself uses an old church, part of which is now used for the Halton Hills Public Library and the old sanctuary of which is now the auditorium for the John Thornton Theatre.
Overview.
Prior to 1912, the church that now houses the library and Theatre was in common use. A large bell is now outside the church commemorating when it was given over for commercial purposes. A local practicing artist, Paul George Hines, who had been in sparse shows in Toronto, asked permission to use the sanctuary as an auditorium for the occasional production. He and his friends occasionally put on a “theatrical production” for the community, but not professionally, nor on a regular schedule. 
In 1959, when Hines died at the age of 78, two theatres were split from the small company that had gathered around the occasional shows: the John Thornton Theatre (named for Hines’ acting teacher in Toronto) and the Georgetown Little Theatre.
After that, the John Thornton Theatre collected three artistic directors, an overall producer, and a corps of about seventy actors (the population of Georgetown is approximately 50 000 and so is quite capable of supporting this number), who are not paid a salary but rather sign up for plays and are paid per run of productions. (Certainly no actors consider this a full-time job.) 
The John Thornton tries to produce a regular three plays per year, with a combined budget of $4,000 CAD; each one generally sees 4 performances, which bring in up to $700 each. According to producer Kim Hines, 2007’s fiscal year budget was $4,376. The theatre also attempts to sponsor one original play from a local playwright, with an outside director, to support the fostering of new arts in Halton Hills, every year. This quota is rarely filled. The last one was 2007’s "A Sordid Life".

Eric Oliver

Eric Staines Oliver (13 April 1911 – 1 March 1980) was an English motorcycle racer best remembered as four time FIM Sidecar World Champion, riding a Norton. His passenger in 1949 was Denis Jenkinson. He is also remembered for his innovation, being the first sidecar competitor to use a dustbin fairing, rear suspension and the first to adopt the kneeling riding position. 
He was also an accomplished solo racer and continued to ride a 350 Grand Prix bike while racing a sidecar.
Oliver made a surprising appearance in the 1958 Isle of Man Sidecar TT race on a standard Norton Dominator 88 with a Watsonian "Monza" road sidecar with Mrs Pat Wise in the sidecar, finishing tenth ahead of many specialised race machines. Oliver's last TT appearance was in the 1960 with passenger Stan Dibben but they had a bad crash in practice with Oliver breaking his back in two places and Dibben was nearly decapitated. Both men decided to retire from racing after this.
Eric Oliver later switched to car racing with a Lotus Elan.

Vedaclidine

Vedaclidine (LY-297,802, NNC 11-1053) is a novel analgesic drug which acts as a mixed agonist–antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, being a potent and selective agonist for the M1 and M4 subtypes, yet an antagonist at the M2, M3 and M5 subtypes. It is orally active and an effective analgesic over 3x the potency of morphine, with side effects such as salivation and tremor only occurring at many times the effective analgesic dose. Human trials showed little potential for development of dependence or abuse, and research is continuing into possible clinical application in the treatment of neuropathic pain and cancer pain relief.

T helper 3 cell

TH3 cells are involved in mucosal immunity and protecting mucosal surfaces in the gut from nonpathogenic non-self antigens. They mediate this non-inflammatory environment by secreting TGF-beta and IL-10. TGF-beta promotes the class switch to low concentrations of IgA which is noninflammatory. IgA does not usually activate the complement system and is not involved with phagocytosis. TH3 inhibits TH1 and TH2 cells. 
T helper 3 cell (Th3) have different cytokine requirements for their growth from CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells. The survival of CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells is dependent upon interleukin 2 (IL-2), while "in vitro" differentiation of Th3 cells is enhanced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), IL-4, and IL-10.
Findings suggest that Th3 cells are a different linage from naturally arising CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells, but it is still unclear whether Th3 cells are the same as induced Treg cells because of the lack of a specific marker for Th3 cells. It was previously shown that TGF-β was produced by intestinal dendritic cells, which has been considered to be the source of cytokines for the induction of Th3 cells in the intestine. Additionally, since TGF-β production was induced by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which is constitutively expressed on naturally arising Treg cells, it is possible that TGF-β production from Treg cells through CTLA-4–mediated signaling may stimulate the differentiation of both induced Treg cells and Th3 cells.

He played briefly for Hapoel Holon, but left the team due to its financial problems, and signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem starting at the beginning of November 2011. 
He is the son of former New York Knicks guard, and current Washington Wizards executive, Ernie Grunfeld. In high school, he averaged 23.9 points per game and was the MVP of his conference. In college, at Stanford University, he was first team All Pacific-10 Conference as a junior. He has also played professionally for EWE Baskets Oldenburg, Aguas de Valencia Gandía Bàsquet, CB Valladolid, and Bnei Hasharon.
Early life.
Grunfeld is Jewish, and the son of former New York Knicks guard, and current Washington Wizards executive, Ernie Grunfeld. His father was also general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks, before becoming President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards.
Basketball career.
High school.
Grunfeld grew up in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, while his father was the GM of the New York Knicks. Due to this, Grunfeld grew up a die-hard Knicks fan, but was still only an average player on his FAMS middle school team in the mid-late 1990s. When his father became the Milwaukee Bucks GM, Grunfeld moved to Wisconsin. It was there that he developed his game, shot up in height, and became a dominating high school player.
In high school he averaged 23.9 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game during his senior season at Nicolet High School. He shot 61% from the floor.[http://www.gostanford.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/grunfeld_dan00.html That season, he was conference MVP, all-league first team, first team all-area ("Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel"), first team all-state (Associated Press), CNI Suburban Player of the Year, and WCBA first team all-state. He was also named by "The Sporting News" as the Best Shooter, out of over than 3,000 players.[http://www.gostanford.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/grunfeld_dan00.html
College.
Grunfeld went on to play at Stanford University, where he had a successful college career. While playing for the Stanford Cardinal and leading the team in scoring (17.0 ppg; # 5 in the Pac-10), in February 2005 he tore his right knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), forcing him to sit out the team's final nine games. He took the time on the sidelines to "observe what certain people do to be successful," and improve his basketball awareness. As a junior in 2004–05, he was named first team All Pacific-10 Conference, to the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District-14 first team, and to the 2005 ESPN The Magazine Academic All-American University Division Second Team, to the District-8 ESPN The Magazine University Division All-Academic First Team, and to the Pac-10 Academic first team. In his senior year in 2005–06, he was a first-team Pac-10 All-Academic selection, and a first-team ESPN The Magazine Academic All-American selection.[http://www.gostanford.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/grunfeld_dan00.html
Professional career.
After going undrafted out of Stanford in 2006, he played his first two professional seasons with the EWE Baskets Oldenburg in the German Basketball Bundesliga, then with Aguas de Valencia Gandía in Spain's LEB Oro League. In September 2008, his childhood dream came true when the New York Knicks signed him to the team under undisclosed terms. On October 23, 2008, Grunfeld was waived by the team. 
In January 2009 he received Romanian citizenship in order to be eligible for playing for the Romania national basketball team. 
He played for Bnei Hasharon in the Israeli Basketball Super League in 2010–11, averaging 14.1 points per game on 56.9% shooting.name="החתמה חדשה">[http://www.shar.co.il/news_one.asp?IDNews=3422 החתמה חדשה!!! </ref> In 2010, he made aliyah, becoming an Israeli citizen.

Wade Island

Wade Island is located in the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Itself a part of the Sheets Island archipelago, the small island is home to Pennsylvania's large nesting colony of herons and egrets.
2002 survey.
In May 2002, the annual survey of the waterbird colony on Wade Island in the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg was conducted. It is Pennsylvania's sole population of nesting Great Egrets, which is why this species is listed as endangered. Some 142 egret nests were found, a 14 percent decrease from 2001. Wade Island is also home to the largest Black-crowned Night Heron rookery in the state. Over the past decade this species suffered a general decline. On a positive note, 107 nests were found, 14 more than in 2001. Surveyors noted a dramatic increase, a near doubling, of cormorant nests from 11 to 21, a 91 percent increase. The most dramatic finding resulted from an assessment of the perimeter of the island taken by Pennsylvania Game Commission biologist Cal Butchkoski. Comparison to a 1987 map revealed severe erosion on the east side of the island resulting in a loss of one third of its area over 15 years.

Andrew Nowacki

Andrew Nowacki (born October 10, 1980, in Stoney Creek, Ontario) is a professional Canadian football wide receiver who is currently a free agent. He most recently played for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. He was drafted by the Eskimos in the third round of the 2004 CFL Draft. He played college football for the Murray State Racers.
College career.
Nowacki began his collegiate career at Scottsdale Community College before transferring after two seasons to Murray State University. From 2001–2003, Nowacki played in 24 games recording 53 receptions for 608 receiving yards. He led the Racers in receiving as a redshirt senior with 43 catches for 477 yards.
Professional career.
Edmonton Eskimos.
Nowacki was selected in the third round (26th overall) by the Edmonton Eskimos in the 2004 CFL Draft. As a rookie, Nowacki rarely played only recording one catch for seven yards. Entering 2005, Nowacki's roster spot was in jeopardy before the Eskimos final season against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He ended up on the team's inactive list to begin the season. He was activated on July 14 after running back Mike Bradley suffered a knee injury. After making a few appearances, Nowacki suffered a finger injury causing him to miss a few games. He was re–activated on September 29. In 2005, Nowacki recorded 18 catches for a total of 151 yards. Following the selection of Pat Woodcock by Edmonton in the CFL Dispersal Draft, Nowacki was possibly going to lose his job as the Eskimos fifth receiver. Despite the Woodcock selection, Nowacki recorded 17 catches for 147 yards in 2006. He was re-signed by Edmonton on January 11, 2007. In the Eskimos first preseason game on June 16, 2007, Nowacki recorded four receptions for a total of 46 yards. After a few injuries to the Eskimos receivers to begin the season, Nowacki began to take a bigger role in the offense. On August 13, 2007 in a game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Nowacki caught his first career touchdown pass. On the following possession for Hamilton their receiver Jason French also a Murray State University graduate, caught a touchdown. The two touchdown catches for Nowacki and French came one minute apart. In the game where quarterback Ricky Ray broke Warren Moon's Eskimos record for most passing yards in Eskimos history, Nowacki caught a five yard touchdown pass. In 2007, Nowacki had 47 receptions for 465 yards with two touchdowns. In 2008, Nowacki played in every game recording 28 catches for 369 yards with two touchdowns. He started the West Semi-Final and caught three passes for 27 yards.
Personal.
He married his girlfriend Erica on February 14, 2009. His sister Renata coaches volleyball at Southeast Missouri State University.

Follicular B Helper T cells

Follicular B helper T cells (also known as just Follicular helper T cells or TFH), are antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells found in the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes, spleens and Peyer's patches, and are identified by their constitutive expression of the B cell follicle homing receptor CXCR5. TFH cells are found within B cell follicles and mediate antigen specific naïve or memory B cell activation, which triggers germinal center formation, probably through the expression of CD40L and the secretion of IL-21 and IL-4. It is possible that TFH cells might arise as branches in the Th1 and Th2 differentiation pathways but their precise lineage relationship to the other effector CD4+ T cell subsets is still uncertain. Recent studies have however shown that TFH have distinct gene expression profiles, supporting the theory that TFH are a subset of CD4+ T cells distinct from Th-1, Th-2, Th-17 or Tregs.
Role of ICOS.
The Inducible T-cell co-stimulator ("CD278" or "ICOS") has proven to provide a particularly critical signal for TFH cells since mice deficient in ICOS are unable to develop any TFH, although the exact mechanisms involved are still unknown. However, it was shown that ICOS induces the secretion of IL-21 by activated CD4+ T cells and that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the development of TFH. Also Bcl-6 is a transcription factor identified in TFH cells, but it may have roles that extend beyond this subset, because it has been implicated in memory CD8+ T cell development.
Role of CD40L.
In germinal centers, antigen-experienced TFH cells rapidly upregulate the expression of CD40L, which binds with B cell surface protein CD40 in B cell-T cell zone vicinity. The TFH cell CD40L and B cell CD40 crosstalk modulates the intracellular receptor and gene expression inside the B cell, including induction of AID (Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase). AID ("AICDA") expression causes B cell antibodies to class switch from IgM/IgD to other antibody isotypes and drives somatic hypermutation during clonal proliferation. The switched antibodies acquire better effector functions, and hypermutated antibody shows greater affinity for antigen. The exact mechanism of AID-mediated B cell maturation is not clear.
"TFH" and Cholera.
"Vibrio cholerae" infected patients and healthy human volunteers administered with existing cholera vaccine are recently studied in Bangladeshi population by Dr. Firdausi Qadri and her group. They have shown that the Memory TFH response is cholera antigen specific and has correlation with further antibody production by B cells.
Autoimmunity.
Finally, it has been shown that dysregulated TFH cells can cause systemic autoimmunity and auto-antibody production or contribute to T cell–mediated organ-specific autoimmunity.

Clara Sipprell

Clara Sipprell (1885–1975) was a Canadian-born, early 20th-century photographer who lived most of her life in the United States. She was well known for her pictorial landscapes and for portraits of many famous actors, artists, writers and scientists.
Life.
Early years.
Clara Estelle Sipprell was born in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada on 31 October 1885. She was the sixth child and only daughter of Francis and Fanny Crabbe Sipprell. Her father died before she was born, and her mother had to find various housekeeping jobs in order to care for the family on her own. Since her mother had trouble finding dependable work, Sipprell’s older brothers lived for a while with their grandparents about fifty miles away from their home.
When they were old enough to work, three of her brothers moved to Buffalo, New York, and her brother Frank got a job as a photographer’s assistant. The brothers sent money back to their mother and encouraged her to join them when she could. At some point before she was ten years old, Sipprell and her mother moved to Buffalo, and, except for travels, she stayed in the United States the rest of her life.
In 1902, Frank borrowed money from an older brother and opened the Sipprell Photography Studio in Buffalo. From the start his sister was fascinated with what went on at the studio, and soon she was acting as Frank’s apprentice. At the age of sixteen she left school and became a full-time assistant, and over the next ten years she learned all of the technical aspects of photography in his studio. Later, Sipprell would credit her brother for both her technical and her aesthetic training, saying "He taught me all I seem to know. He taught me by letting me alone with my mistakes, and for that reason I never became conscious of the limitation of photography."
In her early years Sipprell took photos of landscapes around Buffalo. While learning the technical aspects of the art, she experimented with a wide range of photographic media, including bromoil, gum, carbon and platinum prints. She also made a series of Autochome color prints and continued to prefer that process even after higher quality color film was created.
Because of the work of George Eastman and the establishment of the Eastman Kodak Company in Buffalo, the city became an important center for American photography in the early part of the 20th century. Sipprell became involved in the activities of the Buffalo Camera Club, which, although its membership was closed to women at the time, allowed her to participate because her brother Frank was a member. In 1910 she exhibited her first photos at the Camera Club, one of which won second prize in the portrait competition.
Despite the fact that she could not be a member of the Club, Sipprell continued to show prints in their annual exhibitions. In 1913 she won six prizes at the show, more than any of the Club’s actual members. The photographs she exhibited there attracted the attention of influential art and photography critic Sydney Allen (later known as Sadakichi Hartmann), and he wrote two very favorable reviews of her work. His interest, coupled with her own success, brought her invitations to speak at various photo clubs in New York City, and soon she was spending more time there than in Buffalo.
Rising fame.
In 1915 Sipprell and long-time family friend and teacher Jessica Beers moved to New York, where they shared an apartment on Morningside Drive. The big city better suited Sipprell’s growing bohemian tastes, which quickly came to include smoking cigars, and pipes; drinking bourbon, driving fast convertibles, and wearing capes, exotic jewelry and embroidered Slavic clothing. One friend recalled that she "did not make her work her life, but instead crafted a life that was a work of art."
Within a few months Sipprell established a portrait studio and soon established a long list of clients due to her already well-known artistry. Over the next forty years she would photograph some of the most famous artists, writers, dancers and other cultural icons of the time, including Alfred Stieglitz, Pearl S. Buck, Charles E. Burchfield, Fyodor Chaliapin, Ralph Adams Cram, W. E. B. Du Bois, Albert Einstein, Robert Frost, Granville Hicks, Malvina Hoffman, Langston Hughes, Robinson Jeffers, Isamu Noguchi, Maxfield Parrish and Eleanor Roosevelt.
As a portrait photographer, Sipprell sought to convey a sense of the whole person and what made each unique. She was a traditional pictorialist, interested in simple beauty and soft-focus imagery, and she kept this same aesthetic vision whether she was taking portraits, landscapes or still lifes.
In the late 1910s Sipprell met a young Russian woman named Irina Khrabroff, who became her lifelong friend, traveling companion and, later, her dealer and business manager. When they first met Sipprell still shared her apartment with Beers, but when she moved out in 1923 Khrabroff moved in. Later that year Khrabroff married a man named Feodor Cekich, and the three of them lived together in the same apartment for many years.
In 1924 the threesome traveled to Europe, where Sipprell photographed the Adriatic Coast and, through connections with the Khrabroffs, members of the Moscow arts community. Later these same connections gave her access to many Russian expatriates whom she also photographed, including Countess Alexandra Tolstoy, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Sergei Koussevitzky. Two years later Sipprell and Khrabroff, without her husband, traveled again to Yugoslavia, and Sipprell made another series of photographs of the countryside and the people.
Throughout the 1920s Sipprell continued to exhibit and have her work published, and in 1928 and 1929 she was given her first one-person shows, at San Jose State Teachers College. She also continued her friendship and living arrangement with the Khrabroffs, even after they had a daughter in 1927. However, around 1932 tension developed between Sipprell and her close friends over the rise of the Stalinist government in Russia. The Khrabroffs remained loyal to the ousted czarists, and they felt Sipprell’s continued association with some who were sympathetic to the Stalinists was intolerable. By 1935 the friendship was over, and Sipprell started living on her own for the first time.
Later life.
In 1937 Sipprell moved to Manchester, Vermont, at the suggestion of Vermont poets Walter Hard and Robert Frost. Soon after she met Phyllis Fenner (1899–1982), a writer, librarian, and anthologist of children's books. Fourteen years younger than Sipprell, Fenner soon became Sipprell's housemate and traveling companion. This relationship continued through the final thirty-eight years of Sipprell's life. In the mid-1960s, they had architect Harold Olmstead build them a house in Manchester, which included the first darkroom that Sipprell ever had in the same place she lived. 
It is not clear if Sipprell's relationships with any of the women she lived with were sexual or even romantic, yet their length and stability indicate an extraordinary level of commitment.
Clara Sipprell died in April 1975 at the age of eighty-nine. Her ashes are buried in a plot near an outcropping of rock in Manchester. Attached to the rock is a small bronze tablet on which, in accordance with her wishes, are engraved her own name along with the names of Jessica Beers and Phyllis Fenner.
Over the course of her lifetime her work was shown in more than 100 photography exhibitions around the world. Major collections of her work are housed at the Amon Carter Museum and at Syracuse University.
Her career is best summed up by a critic who wrote,

Hurricane Norbert (2008)

Hurricane Norbert is tied with Hurricane Jimena as the strongest tropical cyclone strike the west coast of Baja California Sur in recorded history. The fifteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and second major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Norbert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave south of Acapulco on October 3. Strong wind shear initially prevented much development, but the cyclone encountered a more favorable environment as it moved westward. On October 5, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norbert, and the system intensified further to attain hurricane intensity by October 6. After undergoing a period of rapid deepening, Norbert reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg). As the cyclone rounded the western periphery of a subtropical ridge over Mexico, it began an eyewall replacement cycle which led to steady weakening. Completing this cycle and briefly reintensifying into a major hurricane, a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, Norbert moved ashore Baja California Sur as a Category 2 hurricane late on October 11. After a second landfall at a weaker intensity the following day, the system quickly weakened over land and dissipated that afternoon.
In preparation for the cyclone, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for coastal regions of the Baja California Peninsula. Residents living in low-lying areas and flood-prone regions were advised to evacuate, and beach-goers were warned to stay out of the water. Upon landfall, the hurricane produced waves in excess of . Though the strongest winds observed were less than hurricane intensity, heavy rainfall as a result of Norbert lead to substantial damage. In Baja California Sur, roughly 5,000 homes sustained major damage; the heaviest-impacted municipality, Comondú, reported 16,000 homes affected. Thousands of people were forced into shelters, and many trees were blown down by strong winds. A total of 25 fatalities occurred in Sonora, 5 of which occurred in Álamos, where excessive rainfall caused a majority of the town to become flooded; homes were submerged to their roofs and many trees were downed. The hurricane severely impacted the fishing industry in Sinaloa, while thousands of residents were left homeless. In the United States, Norbert produced minimal rainfall. In the aftermath of the storm, many towns and municipalities were declared disaster areas. Overall, Norbert inflicted $98.5 million (2008 USD) in damage.
Meteorological history.
The origins of Norbert were from a tropical wave that crossed Central America on September 26 and September 27. An area of disturbed weather formed near the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 28, which at that time was mentioned on the Tropical Weather Outlook (an outlook issued every six hours during hurricane season by the NHC that notes the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis during the next 48 hours). Drifting westward off the coast of Mexico, the system initially consisted of a broad low pressure area and an area of disorganized convection. It slowly organized for several days, and by early on October 4 the system developed enough organized convection to be classified as Tropical Depression Fifteen; at that point, it was located about south of Acapulco. The depression was located over an area of warm water temperatures and moderate vertical wind shear, and as such was forecast to intensify gradually.
About six hours after forming, the circulation of the depression became exposed from the deep convection, due to the wind shear. At the same time, two tropical cyclone forecast models predicted the tropical cyclone formation of a larger disturbance to the southeast of the depression. One model predicted the new cyclone to absorb the depression, although most other models forecast for the depression to remain the dominant system. By early on October 5, deep convection developed and organized around the center of the depression, and satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique suggested that the system had tropical storm force-winds; as a result, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norbert, about south of Zihuatanejo. Norbert slowly intensified, and was upgraded to a hurricane on October 6 as very deep atmospheric convection remained stable despite easterly wind shear.
On October 7, Hurricane Norbert reached Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale while Norbert developed well-defined and closed eyewall as seen in microwave imagery. Overnight on October 8, an eye appeared on infrared satellite, indicating that Norbert was intensifying and the storm was upgraded to a major hurricane respectively. Continuing to rapidly strengthen over warm sea surface temperatures, it reached Category 4 status late on October 8, after intensifying 45 mph (75 km/h) over the previous 24 hours. The storm peak intensity was 135 mph (215 km/h) and a peak pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg) while located south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The peak intensity of Norbert is uncertain as aircraft-based wind speed observations were lower than estimates via Dvorak Technique. However, the cloud pattern became less impressive early on October 9, and was thus downgraded into a Category 3 hurricane, with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) as it moved. The eye began to erode and as such Norbert underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, where one eye is replaced by another. As a result, when Hurricane Hunters investigated the storm later that day, they found that Norbert had weakened considerably. At that time, it was downgraded into a weak Category 1 hurricane on October 9.
On October 10, Norbert turned towards the north while slowing down as it reached the western edge of a subtropical ridge. In an area of light wind shear, Norbert began to re-intensify as the eyewall replacement cycle completed. The cyclone turned to the north-northeast due to a mid to upper level trough that was moving over the Southwest United States. Norbert managed to restrengthen into a Category 3 hurricane on 0600 UTC October 11, and made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane near Puerto Charley. The next day, Norbert struck southern Sonora at Category 1 intensity. Norbert rapidly dissipated by October 12 while inland over Mexico. Norbert was a Category 2 hurricane at landfall and is currently tied with Hurricane Jimena for the strongest storm to strike the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula.
Preparations.
A hurricane warning was issued on October 10 for parts of the central Baja California Peninsula from Puerto San Andresito southward to Agua Blanca, and they extended around the peninsula from La Paz to Loreto. The warnings were put in place on the mainland west coast from Topolobampo to Guaymas. Hurricane watches were issued from Agua Blanca to Cabo San Lucas, and were extended around the Baja California peninsula to La Paz; these same areas were also under tropical storm warnings as well. Tropical storm warnings also extended from Loreto northward to Mulegé on the eastern side of the peninsula.
On October 10, officials in Baja California declared the municipalities of Loreto, Comondú and La Paz disaster areas in anticipation of severe damage from the hurricane.
The mayor of Los Cobos, Oscar Nunez, strongly advised residents living in sub-par housing and in low-lying areas to prepare to evacuate. The local civil protection official stated bridges are ready to begin evacuating As the storm produced cloudy skies in Baja California, fishermen moved their boats onto the beach in La Paz. Beach officials warned people to stay out of the water. As flood water rose, residents fled from their homes and into shelters. "All precautions are in place ... we have prepared temporary shelters," said Jose Gajon, director of Baja California Sur rescue services. The NHC warned interests in the area to monitor the progress of Norbert. The storm was expected by the NHC to reach the U.S. States of New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona as a tropical depression. In Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, farmers rushed to fertilize the fields prior to the passage of Norbert.
Impact.
Baja California Sur.
The storm was responsible for waves. Norbert was also responsible produced peak winds of and a gust in Los Mochis. This observation occurred at 0200 UTC October 12. The maximum single-day rainfall total from Norbert was in Ciudad Constitucion.
Throughout Baja California Sur, officials estimated that damages from the hurricane was equivalent to 292.2 million MXN (25 million USD). Water damages totaled to 8.8 million MXN ($650,000 USD). Furthermore, damage to homes was 68.3 million pesos (6 million USD) while damage to school was reported to be 5 million MXN ($41,000 USD). In addition, highway damage totaled to 36.6 million MXN (USD). Roughly 5,000 homes sustained severe damage and roads throughout the state were also severely affected. About 100,000 people were without power at the height of the storm. The worst damage occurred in the municipality of Comondú where 16,000 residents reported damage to their homes. A total of 2,850 people were housed in temporary shelters. According to tourism officials, hotel reservations were down 40% in Las Cobos and Lorento Roofs were ripped off buildings and many trees were damaged. On the islands of Santa Margarita and Magdalena, 40% of homes received some damage, mostly roof damage. The La Paz airport closed prior to the arrival of the system, but the Los Cabos International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the tropical cyclone. In La Paz, the storm produced violent winds, a few last-minute drivers on streets with fallen trees. Rescue workers had to rescue many Mexicans in low lying areas from their wood and sheet metal homes. In a drive-thru entrance, a happy hour sign was ripped off due to strong winds. Local residents south shelter by school buses and army trucks as floodwaters entered their homes. High winds uprooted palm trees and the water was knee-deep in many areas of Puerto San Carlos.
The storm also affected cruise ships. While "Carnival Pride" and "" survived the worst of the hurricane, the "Carnival Elation" was expected to arrive one day earlier than initially anticipated.
Sonora.
After crossing the Gulf of California, Norbert made landfall in Sonora as a strong Category 1 hurricane. A total of 25 people were killed, five of which were in Álamos. In addition, three others were reported as missing. Total damage in Sonora, excluding the town of Álamos was estimated at MXN 800 million (2008, $59.1 million). At the port of Topolobampo, rough seas from the storm sank four ships and damaged 70 others. The town of Álamos sustained the most severe damage in the area, with damage in the town exceeding MXN 200 million ($14.7 million). In Álamo, water rushed down the mountains nearby, flooding almost every channel in the city. Some scared residents fled to rooftops and higher ground. A total of 95 homes were destroyed and concrete walls were knocked down. Cars and trucks smashed in trees. Furniture and other personal items were on the streets after the storm.
Sinaloa.
The fishing industry in Sinaloa sustained severe losses, with 200 shrimp boats being destroyed leaving MXN 8 million (2008, $600,000 USD ) in damages. Roughly 6,000 people were left homeless in Sinaloa as hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed by Norbert. Officials evacuated 6,000 people in four municipalities (Guasave, Ahome, Choix and El Fuerte). Due to flooding, officials announced that would evacuate seven communities. The port Mazatlan was closed for navigation. A state of emergency was declared for five municipalities throughout the region.
United States.
The remnants of the storm dropped moderate precipitation across western Texas, but there were no immediate issues. Across New Mexico, a deep upper-level low enhanced moisture across the region. A severe thunderstorm moved over Torrance County. Six power poles were snapped, a steel building was destroyed and blown onto Interstate 40 and three water tanks were severely damaged. Winds of to were recorded with gusts up to . Throughout the state, total damage equaled $143,000.
Aftermath.
On October 14, Governor Eduardo Bours Castelo of Sonora announced a two year reconstruction plan for Álamos with an initial budget of MXN 100 million ($7.3 million). The municipalities of Ahome, El Fuerte, Choix, Guasave and the city of Sinaloa de Leyva were declared disaster areas following the storm, allowing federal funding and supplies to be sent to the regions. The government in Sonora provided at least MXN 400 million ($29.5 million) in relief funds following the hurricane. Most of northern Sinaloa was also declared a disaster area.

George Jack

George Washington Henry Jack (8 August 1855 – 15 December 1931) was a British Arts and Crafts designer and architect. Born in America, he grew up and trained in Scotland, before moving south to join the office of Philip Webb. A contemporary of William Morris, Jack designed furniture for Morris & Co., and was a member of the Art Workers Guild and the Arts and Crafts Society. After the turn of the 20th century, he set up his own practice, which continued until his death.
Biography.
Jack was born on Long Island, New York, the son of an engraver of Scottish descent. On his father's early death in 1860, the young Jack was taken by his mother, a pianist, back to Scotland, where they settled in Glasgow. In 1869, Jack was articled to the office of Horatio Bromhead, where he met Thomas Hamilton Crawford. He then moved on to London, first joining the practice of Charles Vinall, and then, in 1880, the office of Philip Webb (1831–1915), the so-called "Father of Arts and Crafts Architecture".
Webb introduced Jack to William Morris (1834–1896), one of the leading figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement, and from 1885 Jack designed furniture for Morris & Co. He also developed skills in wood carving and other crafts, including mosaics and stained glass. He joined the Central School of Arts and Crafts on its foundation in 1896, teaching wood carving under the Principal, William Lethaby. From 1900, Jack also taught at the Royal College of Art. He published the handbook "Woodcarving, Design and Workmanship" in 1903.
After Webb's retirement in 1900, Jack continued his architectural practice, in partnership with Thomas Crawford from 1902 to 1907. In 1902, he purchased a house in Station Road, Church End, North London, which became his home, office and workshop. When World War I broke out, Jack joined the architecture department of London County Council, resuming his private practice after the war. Shortly before his death, he was involved, with the architect Charles Winmill, in the renovations of St. Margaret's church in Barking. Jack also designed mosaics for Seoul Anglican Cathedral, Korea.
In 2006, the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, hosted the first exhibition devoted to the work of George Jack.

Yang Wan

Yang Wan (楊綰) (died August 27, 777), courtesy name Gongquan (公權), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving briefly as chancellor during the reign of Emperor Daizong. He was known for his frugality, and it was said that his becoming chancellor caused a number of other officials to change their wasteful ways.
Background.
It is not known when Yang Wan was born, but it is known that his family was from Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). His family traced its ancestry to the Han Dynasty official Yang Zhen (楊震) and a line that included a number of officials of Northern Wei. His granduncle Yang Zaisi served as a chancellor during the reign of Wu Zetian, and his grandfather Yang Wenyu (楊溫玉) was a prominent official at the time, receiving the title of Duke of Hucheng. Yang Wan lost his father early, and he served his mother with great filial piety. He was said to be quiet and studious, often spending his time in a small room with history books and maps.
During Emperor Xuanzong's reign.
Eventually, at the urging of his relatives and friends, Yang Wan stood for the imperial examinations and passed them, and he was made a scribe to Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince. In 754, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong ascended Qinzheng Tower (勤政樓), he ordered that the examinees who had passed the examinations be further offered four special examinations on that day — deep knowledge of the Confucian classics, understanding of Taoist writings, ability to write beautifully, and capability in military strategies — giving them one day to complete the examination. Yang was one of the three selected for writing beautiful poems, and he was promoted to be "You Shiyi" (右拾遺), a low-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng").
During Emperor Suzong's reign.
In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang (范陽, in modern Beijing), and by summer 756, the forces of his new state of Yan were approaching the Tang capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, however, did not follow him to Chengdu, but fled to Lingwu instead, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong). In the turmoil, despite great difficulty, Yang undertook the journey to join Emperor Suzong at Lingwu — at times resorting to begging for food — and once he reached Lingwu, Emperor Suzong made him the imperial archivist (起居舍人, "Qiju Sheren") and put him in charge of drafting imperial edicts. He was eventually made "Zhongshu Sheren" (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau, and was in charge of editing the imperial history. There had been a custom at the legislative bureau that the most senior among the "Zhongshu Sheren" would receive special honors, and the 80% of the stipends given to them on the whole would be allocated to him. Yang was set to receive this special treatment, but he believed that as all of the "Zhongshu Sheren" had the same rank and responsibilities, the stipends should be divided equally, and he was much praised for this modesty.
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
By 763 — by which time Emperor Suzong had died and been succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong — Yang Wan was serving as the deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, "Libu Shilang"). He proposed a comprehensive reform of the Tang imperial examination system — believing that the two main examination types at the time, the "Jinshi" (進士) examination and the "Mingjing" (明經) examination, had both strayed off their original intents. In particular, as a result of poor choices in examination topics, the "Jinshi" examinees had become overly obsessed at writing ability, while the "Mingjing" examinees had become overly obsessed in trivia in the Confucian classics, without either type of examinees showing true abilities. He proposed that the examination system be returned to the Han Dynasty type — that the examinees had to first be tested and recommended by county magistrates, and then by prefectural prefects; then, after they went through these two rungs and stood for imperial examinations at the capital, they were to be subjected to 20 questions on explaining the classics and three inquiries on special topics of state interest. He also advocated the abolition of the imperial examination on Taoism. Yang's proposal drew much debate, although it was ultimately rejected on the account that it was overly radical of a change to the examination system. However, in 764, when he proposed that two other special examinations — for those known for their devotion to family and for children under 10 who already were knowledgeable in one of the classics — be abolished, as they did not test true abilities either, Emperor Daizong agreed and abolished them. He was later made the deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, "Libu Shilang"), and was known for his fairness in selecting officials.
At that time, the most powerful chancellor at court was Yuan Zai, who was deeply trusted by Emperor Xuanzong and who had, through his use of power, drawn other officials to associate with him. Yang, however, would not associate with Yuan, and Yuan, wanting to remove Yang from his important post, acted as if he wanted to honor Yang for his reputation and for his seniority, made Yang the principal of the imperial university (國子祭酒, "Guozi Jijiu") in 770 and replaced Yang with a corrupt associate, Xu Hao (徐浩). Eventually, Emperor Daizong made Yang, known for his frugality, the minister of worship (太常卿, "Taichang Qing"), hoping that he could help to change the wasteful customs among the officials at the time.
As the years went by, Yuan and his chancellor colleague Wang Jin became increasingly corrupt, and Emperor Daizong eventually tired of this. In 777, he had Yuan and Wang arrested; Yuan was executed, while Wang was exiled. He replaced them with Yang and Chang Gun — with Yang given the post of "Zhongshu Shilang" (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau) and given the "de facto" chancellor designation of "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事). It was said that the day that Yang was made chancellor, his reputation for frugality caused a change in his colleagues' behavior. In particular, the general Guo Ziyi reduced the musicians at his feasts by 80%; the official Li Gan (黎幹), who liked to have a large group of guards on horseback to accompany him, reduced his guards to 10; and the official Cui Kuan (崔寬) tore down his excessively large home. It was further said that Emperor Daizong intended to have Yang be in charge of correcting the corruption that permeated the imperial government at the time, but soon after Yang became chancellor, he suffered a stroke. His condition at one point got better, but he eventually died later in the year. Emperor Daizong was greatly saddened and was said to have told the officials, "Is it that Heaven does not wish for me to have peace in this realm that it took away Yang Wan this quickly?" The officials in charge of posthumous names proposed that he be given the posthumous name Wenjian (文簡, meaning "civil and undiscriminating"), which Emperor Daizong agreed. When an official jealous of Yang, Su Duan (蘇端), was induced by Chang (who was also jealous of Yang) to argue that that was an overly praiseful posthumous name, Emperor Daizong was enraged and exiled Su. Those who praised Yang for his frugality and his understanding of Buddhist and Taoist philosophical principles compared him to the Han Dynasty officials Yan Zhen and Bing Ji (丙吉) and the Jin Dynasty (265–420) officials Shan Tao and Xie An.

My Story (Julie Couillard book)

My Story (or Mon histoire) is a tell-all memoir by Canadian Julie Couillard. It was first written in French, then during summer 2008, translated into English. Both versions were published across Canada in October 2008. 
Couillard first appeared in the national media when she dated the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Bernier. The Bernier-Couillard Affair erupted in May 2008 over confidential, NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help dispel rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a book deal. 
In her book, she recounts her early years, describes her relationship with Bernier, and reveals his confidential opinions.
Intended to be released on October 14, 2008, the book's release date was moved forward when that same day was selected for the Canadian federal election. Bernier dismissed the embarrassing allegations against him in her book as ridiculous. Though "My Story" was released eight days prior to the election, Bernier nonetheless was re-elected in his district of Beauce. The English version peaked at #6 on "La Presse"'s bestseller list while the French version reached #5. Critics found Couillard's story self-righteous and sometimes conveniently vague, but noted that it provided a unique view into the government's inner circle.
Background.
Julie Couillard began dating Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament, Maxime Bernier, in April 2007. The media started covering her in August, when she wore a revealing dress to Bernier's swearing-in ceremony for his new position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple had first met at a restaurant-dinner with business associates. Couillard and Bernier dated until December 2007 but continued seeing each other until April 2008. Their relationship became the subject of a political scandal which brought about intense media attention. As the scandal unfolded, Couillard decided to write an autobiography, telling her side of the story. She formally signed a contract in July with publishers, McClelland & Stewart; and with the help of journalist, Serge Demers, a ghostwriter, she wrote "My Story" in French within a few months. The publisher translated the text into English.
Bernier-Couillard affair.
Bernier was elected as a Conservative star candidate in Quebec and became the Minister of Industry before being re-assigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in August 2007. Though his relationship with Couillard had ended in December, they continued with occasional trysts. In April 2008, as Bernier hurriedly departed Couillard's home, he left behind confidential, NATO-related briefing notes; they were from the 2008 Bucharest summit. He asked Couillard to destroy them. Couillard, on the other hand, put the notes aside and forgot about them until May when she returned the notes to a foreign affairs office. Significant discussion about the affair was then voiced in both the Canadian House of Commons and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security.
After discussions with Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, Bernier resigned as Minister of Foreign Affairs, a day before the airing of Couillard's interview with TVA. Political commentators called the affair a threat to national security due to Bernier's carelessness and to Couillard's background with motorcycle biker gangs. According to Couillard, Bernier's response to the subsequent media coverage made her feel betrayed and abandoned.
Content.
The book begins as an autobiography. Couillard was born in the late-1960s in the Montreal district of Ville-Émard; then she moved to the suburb of Lorraine when she was 4. Her parents often fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard then became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Giguère, a money lender who was associated with the controversial, motorcycle club, Hells Angels. In 1996, after the police raided Giguère's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Giguère became sullen and withdrawn: the police had charged him with conspiracy to commit murder. But two months later, they let the charge drop. Giguère was soon murdered.
In 1997, Couillard met Stéphane Sirois, a reputed "enforcer" and drug dealer, member of the Rockers a Hells Angels affiliate club. They married. However, financial problems interfered with their relationship; furthermore, Couillard had cheated on Sirois with a man named Bruno. During their divorce, Sirois became an informant for the police and entered a witness protection program. Couillard then became pregnant with Bruno's child, and had an abortion; they subsequently separated. Following further personal, financial problems, Couillard declared bankruptcy in 2002. She then began an affair with a married man who abandoned her while they visited Venice, Italy. When she returned to Canada, Couillard launched a security firm, Integrated Global Solutions, along with an auto-leasing business. Meanwhile, she began to date Bernard Coté, an aide to federal Minister of Public Works, Michael Fortier. Couillard then introduced Coté to Philippe Morin of the Kevlar Group, a real estate company which signed a deal with the federal government to acquire land from Kevlar. Once the deal became public Coté's involvement was considered a conflict of interest and Fortier, responsible for the actions of his staff, was forced to resign, despite Morin denying any connection between Kevlar and Couillard.
Then, in April 2007, while attending a Conservative Party of Canada fundraising affair, Couillard was asked to consider being a candidate for the party. Later, she attended a dinner where she met Maxime Bernier; they began dating. Bernier registered Couillard as his designated traveling companion with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order for Couillard to accompany Bernier on government business.
In her book, Couillard characterizes Bernier as intellectually lazy, preoccupied with his appearance, and as concerned that he appears gay. She writes further that Bernier privately criticized Prime Minister Stephen Harper's eating habits and his physique. She adds that Bernier spoke with party supporters about replacing Harper as the party leader, and says that Bernier opposed the invasion of Iraq contrary to his party's stance. Further revelations regarding Bernier include that he whispered negative comments to Couillard about members of his electoral district; and that he did not own a laptop, yet frequently used her house and home computer as a second office. 
Couillard goes on to describe the NATO document incident and the ensuing media coverage from her perspective.
Publication and reception.
The original publication date for the book was October 14, 2008. After the Canadian federal election was called and set for that day the book's release was re-scheduled to October 6, eight days before the election in which Bernier was seeking re-election. The English version was published as a hard cover by McClelland & Stewart while the French version was released by Montreal publishers, Les Editions de l'Homme, as a trade paperback. According to "La Presse", 17,000 copies were printed; 5,000 sold in the first two weeks. In the Montreal market, the book was listed on the bestseller list at #6 for two weeks while the French version spent one week at #5.
In response to the book, Bernier dismissed the contents as "soap-opera politics and completely ridiculous" and denied ever criticizing Harper or constituents. "The Ottawa Citizen" reviewer, Chris Cobb, and "The Globe and Mail"'s, Christie Blatchford called Couillard's story self-righteous, contradictory, and conveniently vague. Cobb commented that "viewed through a political lens, it's an entertaining page-turner" as it provides "a rare glimpse inside the closed, controlled society that is the Harper government." Additionally, writer, William Johnson, said the book story unfolds like pulp fiction or a soap opera and compares Couillard to the abused heroine in "Justine" who does not learn from her calamities.
Bernier went on to win his election in Beauce with 62% of the vote. Harper won re-election as prime-minister; he did not appoint Bernier to a cabinet position. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party official to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada; and on whether there was influence peddling during the land sale between the Kevlar Group and Public Works.

IOU

An IOU (abbreviated from the phrase "I owe you") is usually an informal document acknowledging debt. An IOU differs from a promissory note in that an IOU is not a negotiable instrument and does not specify repayment terms such as the time of repayment. IOUs usually specify the debtor, the amount owed, and sometimes the creditor. IOUs may be signed or carry distinguishing marks or designs to ensure authenticity. In some cases, IOUs may be redeemable for a specific product or service rather than a quantity of currency.
California Registered Warrants.
Also referred to as "IOUs" by the U.S. state of California, the term "Registered Warrants", which specify a future payment date, is meant to differentiate these IOUs from regular, or “normal” payroll warrants which permit the holder to exchange their warrant for cash immediately. For both types of warrants, redeeming them may be delayed until funds are available. Because of this uncertainty, warrants are not negotiable instruments. Registered Warrants were issued in July 2009 due to a temporary inability of the state of California to redeem its warrants. Warrants are issued as payment to state employees, private businesses, local governments, taxpayers receiving tax refunds, and owners of unclaimed money.

Jassy Conference

The Jassy Conference was a gathering of anti-Bolshevik political figures that met in Iaşi (Jassy), the temporary capital of Romania at the time from November 16 through December 6, 1918. The object of the conference, organized by an obscure figure attached to the French consulate in Kiev, was to coordinate the anti-Bolshevik movements of Southern Russia in order to facilitate dealings with the Allied powers. The twenty-one delegates could not reconcile their differences, despite the need to be unified before the Allies in requesting aid. The conference did nothing to forward any agreements. The Jassy Conference, however, did agree on two points: the desirability of Allied intervention in the civil war and the indivisibility of Russia. In a vote, no candidate for future ruler of Russia could even garner half the votes – General Denikin had the most with nine.

Ron Doig, Sr.

Ronald Oldham Doig (10 July 1909 – 17 September 1932) was an Australian sportsman who played Australian rules football for South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and first-class cricket with Western Australia.
A member of the famous Doig family of Fremantle, Ron was a first cousin of George Doig. He made his debut for South Fremantle at the age of just 17 in 1927 and by 1930 was representing Western Australia at interstate football. He was captain of South Fremantle in 1931 and captain-coach in 1932.
On the cricket field, Doig was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and right-handed batsman. He made three first-class cricket appearances for Western Australia, the first of which came in 1926/27 against South Australia. Doig didn't bowl and instead played as a top order batsman, making scores of eight and five. 
He had to wait until 1931 to play again at first-class level, with his opportunity coming when South Africa toured. Batting at four, he failed to impress with the bat but took what would be the only wicket of his career, bowling opener Herbie Taylor. When South Africa returned to Perth five months later, Doig made his only other first-class appearance but didn't have an impact on the game.
In the finals of the 1932 WAFL season, Doig, who was now captain-coach of South Fremantle, was seriously injured in a match against East Perth. He died from his injuries.

Miner's Cup

The Miner's Cup is the trophy awarded to the winner of the college football game between the and the . The rivalry has been around since 1920, but the tradition of a "traveling trophy" between the two schools has only been around since 2002; Tech has won the trophy for nine out of a possible 12 times since the tradition was begun.
History.
The rivalry between the two universities has been around since 1920. Since then, they have met 87 times, with the series record tied at 41-41-5. The tradition of a "traveling trophy" did not begin until 2002, when Michigan Tech’s Athletics Department and its Army ROTC combined to create it. The trophy itself is an antique miner's helmet that is mounted on a wooden base. The helmet was found at an antique store in the Houghton, Michigan area.
Recent contests.
2007.
In 2007, Northern took the Cup after beating Michigan Tech 34-27. At halftime, the Wildcats led 20-14. The Huskies' scoring came from a 3 yard run by Phil Milbrath and a 14 yard pass from Steve Short, MTU's quarterback, to Keith White, while the Wildcats' scoring came on a 32 yard field goal, a 79 yd pass from Buddy Rivera to Fred Wells, a 35 yard pass from Rivera to Luke Carlson and Anthony Leandri 49 yard field goal. This field goal was the longest of his career, and only 3 yards away from NMU's record.
The Wildcats scored two touchdowns in the 3rd Quarter to lead the game 34-14 by the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Huskies came back to make it 34-27. It came down to the final play of the game: Steve Short, the quarterback for Michigan Tech, took a draw play up the middle from the 4 yard line, but he was tripped up at the 1 yard line and the Wildcats won.
2008.
In 2008, the teams met at the Superior Dome on September 18 at 8 p.m. The game was nationally televised by CBS College Sports Network and Fox Sports Detroit, and it put Tech on national TV for the second time in three years. A record 8,672 people attended the game, beating the old record of 8,432, which was set against Ferris State on Oct. 5, 1991.
The game was low-scoring throughout the first half, with the teams combining for only three touchdowns and two field goals in the first half. All three touchdowns were achieved through the air from 18 (NMU), 67 (MTU) and 81 yards (NMU) out, while Tyler Cattelino put through two field goals from 19 and 24 yards through for Tech. The score at the half was 14-13 in favor of Northern.
However, it changed drastically after the intermission for halftime, as Tech opened up a large lead by scoring on its first four possessions of the second half. Phil Milbrath, Tech's running back, scored four touchdowns from 10, 8, 70, and 8 yards out. Sandwiched between the third and fourth possessions was NMU's final score, a 26 yard pass from quarterback Ben Hempel to receiver Zach Nichols. Scoring concluded with an 80-yard interception return for Tech with 1:29 left in the 4th quarter, and Tech won the game 47-21.
Big plays were a major factor in the game. NMU's 81 yard score came with only 1:38 left in the first half, and Tech's 67 and 70 yard scores came on the first plays of their respective drives.
2009.
The 2009 contest was fought at Michigan Tech's Sherman Field before a crowd of 4,027. NMU struck first, with a 62-yard touchdown pass from Carter Kopach to Dustin Brancheau with 9:51 left in the first quarter. The second quarter saw more scoring, with NMU scoring two touchdowns on runs from Mark Bossuah and Tech throwing for a touchdown and connecting on a field goal with 58 seconds left in the half. The score was 21–10 at the half, with NMU in the lead. In the second half, however, NMU began to open up their lead, scoring two more touchdowns on a 36-yard pass and an interception which was returned all the back, increasing their lead to 34–10 (an extra point attempt was missed). NMU remained firmly in control for the remainder of the game, scoring twice more in the 4th on 65- and 5-yard runs before Tech scored one last time with 1:34 remaining but missed the extra point. The final score was 48–16.

David Newsome

David Anthony Newsome M.D. FARVO (16 April 1942 – 24 February 2011) was a scientist, ophthalmologist, inventor, and author. He studied the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and proposed the usefulness of zinc supplements to slow the rate of vision loss from age-related macular degeneration.
He also found that the eye's pigmented retina, a type of covering or epithelial tissue, could produce some types of collagen. His findings came when it was thought that epithelial tissues either could not (or did not) produce collagen. His new observations opened a new field of investigation of the collagen and related structural molecules in the eye and other tissues.
Biography.
A native of North Carolina, Newsome earned a B.A. from Duke University and an M.D. from The College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University. He completed a residency in ophthalmology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital. He then served as a medical and surgical Fellow in retinal diseases, followed by a fellowship in retinal and surgical diseases at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami. He is Board Certified by the American Board of Ophthalmology.
He continued clinical research and training activities at the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, where he rose to Chief of the Retinal and Ocular Connective Tissue Disease Section, National Eye Institute. He subsequently became Associate Professor of Ophthalmology in the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University. He next accepted a tenured Professorship of Ophthalmology at Louisiana State University. During that time, he continued to head a research laboratory and pursue teaching activities as Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology, Tulane University School of Medicine.
He then established a private clinical practice in New Orleans, Louisiana. After 15 years as President of the Retinal Institute of Louisiana, which he founded and operated, he was forced by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to relocate to the Tampa Bay area of Florida. He left clinical medicine to accept the position of Chief Scientific Officer of an emerging pharmaceutical company.
Philanthropy.
Throughout his professional career, Newsome was active in philanthropic endeavors. Locally, he founded the Meals On Wheels New Orleans Fund. He founded Eye Care Haiti. Headquartered in Port-au-Prince, the organization added multiple rural clinics in addition to the operating suites and training programs in the capital city.
Awards.
In January 2009, he received the Founding Patron Award from Meals on Wheels New Orleans. The award was presented at the first fundraising gala since Katrina, and marked the rebirth of one of the most important people-to-people services in the community.
In May 2010, he became a Fellow of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, the world's leading eye and vision research group.
Publications.
He authored approximately 160 peer-reviewed professional papers and one professional book, "Retinal Dystrophies and Degenerations", Raven Press, New York, 1988. 
He also co-wrote a cookbook, "The New Orleans Program: Eat, Exercise, Enjoy Life," a collaboration with award-winning New Orleans Chef John Besh, which combines recipes and nutrition with common-sense advice on weight to prevent diabetes and other diseases.

John McArthur, Jr.

John McArthur Jr (1823–1890) was a prominent American architect based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Best remembered as the architect of the landmark Philadelphia City Hall, McArthur also designed some of the city's most ambitious buildings of the Civil War era. Few of his buildings survive.
Career.
John McArthur, Jr., was born in Bladenock, Scotland, on 13 May 1823, and came to the United States with his family when he was ten years old. Much of his mature style was characterized by Italianate and Second Empire forms and several of his best-known buildings feature mansard roofs, which he helped to introduce and popularize in the United States. During the American Civil War, McArthur planned 24 temporary war hospitals, including Fort Delaware's 600-bed hospital on Pea Patch Island.
Philadelphia has looked up to McArthur’s architecture for more than a century. The 250-foot-tall tower-and-spire of his Tenth Presbyterian Church (1854) was the tallest structure in the city when built. (Its 150-foot wooden spire was removed in 1912.) Later, this was surpassed by the tower of City Hall (1874–1901), whose 548 feet (167 meters) made it the tallest occupied building in the world when completed. Until the late 20th century, an unwritten agreement among Philadelphia architects kept all buildings shorter than the top of the statue of William Penn atop McArthur’s tower.
A Presbyterian and a member of Tenth Church, McArthur was married to Matilda Prevost; they had two sons and two daughters. 
McArthur died in Philadelphia on January 8, 1890.

Supa Strikas

Supa Strikas is a pan-African football (soccer)-themed comic, about the world’s greatest football team. Despite their enormous talent, the players must adapt in a game where being the best is only the beginning, and where the opposition is always full of surprises. The Supa Strikas comic prints 1.4 million copies per month in 16 countries. Supa Strikas appeared on Caltex and Texaco as an ad.
The comic’s global headline sponsor is Chevron (the Caltex and Texaco brands appear on Supa Strikas’ match and training apparel), with other headline sponsors including VISA, GT Bank and Henkel. Partner sponsors feature in each Supa Strikas territory, including Grassroot Soccer, Metropolitan Life, Spur Steak Ranches, VISA, South African National Roads Agency, MTN, amongst others.
Sponsors exposure includes perimeter boards in game scenes, product placement / engagement (e.g.: the team often eats at Spur Steak Ranches in the South African edition) and full page advertisements.
History.
The comic series was first published in South Africa in 2000. Afterwards publication spread to various sub-saharan African countries. By 2002 was available in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia. Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda soon followed.
"Supa Strikas", an adaptation of the British comic "Roy of the Rovers", receives sponsorship from several companies, including Nike, Caltex, and other South African businesses. The sponsoring firms have product names on various panels.
The series was based on "Shakes" Mokena, a boy from Soweto area of Johannesburg. With demand for the comic growing increasingly global, Supa Strikas’ core characters remained local but a more international cast grew around them, including characters of Asian, Latin American and European extraction.
Today, the comic is available across Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritius, Reunion, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Egypt); in Latin America (Colombia, El Salvador, Panama, Brazil, Honduras and Guatemala); in Europe (Norway, Sweden, Finland) and Asia (Malaysia and Philippines).
Supa Strikas is also an animated series. The 22 minute per episode show debuted in early 2009 in all Supa Strikas territories, and returns in 2010.
Main Plot.
In their bid to raise the Super League trophy, the world’s greatest soccer team, Supa Strikas, must adventure through the world of soccer. Supa Strikas explore the roots of the game (from Mexico to China), meet its greatest players (past and present) and confront its most unscrupulous coaches and players!
The story centers around the team’s young striker, Shakes, whom many believe is the best striker in the world. But for Shakes and his teammates, being the best is only the beginning. The game’s global legacy and the players who dream of being crowned Super League champs mean Shakes must constantly challenge himself to remain in contention. As a result he often finds himself spearheading the team’s exploration of the unknown – be it a strange land, a strange opposition or a new soccer challenge.
Supa Strikas combines humor (often in the form of Shakes’ best mate, Spenza), action, technology and exploration in the context of a real soccer challenge. The stories are usually positive life messages that deal with self-actualization, fair play, teamwork and respect.

Sakura-class destroyer

The was a class of two destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy.
Background.
Although unable to obtain funding in fiscal year 1907 for additional s, which were expensive due to their large size and imported turbine engines, the Imperial Japanese Navy was also unwilling to purchase three additional "Kamikaze"-class destroyers as recommended by the government. In a compromise, the Navy agreed to purchase two medium size ships instead.
Both were designed and built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal in Japan.
Design.
The "Sakura"-class ships were half the displacement of the previous "Umikaze" class but with the same basic hull design. Externally, the design went from four to three smokestacks, which was a first for the Japanese Navy; however, internally the troublesome heavy fuel oil-fired Parsons steam turbine engines of the "Umikaze" class were replaced by standard coal-fired triple expansion steam engines, which gave better reliability and fuel consumption. The lower rated power of 9,500 shp gave the vessels a maximum speed of , however, better fuel consumption equated to longer range, which was what the Imperial Japanese Navy needed.
Armament was similar to that of the "Umikaze" class, with one QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I - IV, mounted on the deck forward of the bridge, and four QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval guns, mounted one on either side and two towards the stern of the ship, with two 450-mm torpedoes launchers.
Operational history.
Japan had fifty destroyers operational at the start of World War I. Although intended for coastal operation, with the "Umikaze"-class destroyers too short in range to operate overseas and with all previous classes of destroyers too small and/or obsolete for front-line service, the two "Sakura"-class destroyers were Japan's most advanced front-line destroyers during the opening stages of the war. Both were deployed extensively overseas as part of Japan’s contribution to the war effort under the terms of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.
The "Sakura"-class ships were re-rated as second-class destroyers on August 28, 1912, and served until April 1, 1932 when both were retired.

Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg

The Count of Wedel-Jarlsberg (also "Wedel Jarlsberg") is a title of the Norwegian nobility and of the Danish nobility. The family of Wedel-Jarlsberg is a branch of the family von Wedel, which comes from Pomerania, Germany. Family members have had a significant position in the 18th and 19th centuries' Norwegian history.
Feudal Count Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg played in 1814 an active rôle in the constitutional assembly at Eidsvoll, and was the first native Norwegian to hold the post of governor (representing the absent king as head of the Norwegian cabinet) during the union with Sweden.
Barons of Wedel-Jarlsberg.
Several members of the Wedel-Jarlsberg family, and mainly younger sons and daughters of the count, had baronial dignity.
1821.
The 1821 Law of Nobility abolished noble privileges and the recognition of noble titles in Norway, but, however, allowed the current bearers to keep the recognised noble status and titles for their lifetime. Thus, the title Feudal Count of Wedel-Jarlsberg did not end until the death of Feudal Count Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg (1809–1893).
Jarlsberg Main Farm and Estate.
Jarlsberg Main Farm ("Jarlsberg Hovedgård") three kilometres northwest of the centre of the town of Tønsberg in Vestfold, Norway has traditionally been the residence of members of the Wedel-Jarlsberg family. In September 1683, Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve, the illegitimate son of the King, sold the manor to Gustav Wilhelm von Wedel, a Danish officer who was made Commanding General in Norway in 1681. Field Marshal v. Wedel received the name Wedel af Jarlsberg in 1684, at which time he by letters patent was created a feudal count.
After a fire in 1699, the manor house was built up again. In 1812, Feudal Count Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg rebuilt the castle in the empire style. Around the manor there were arranged big, but simple garden and parks areas.
The manor house is mainly from 1812, but with various improvements. The first floor of the main building is the column hall that has been used for concerts. Knight's hall on the second floor is used for private companies. There are other public trails over the property along the shoreline and through woodland which is also a private cemetery. Jarlsberg Estate is today one of Norway's largest farm with about cultivated land.

Billings Clinic also owns and operates Aspen Meadows, a 90-bed retirement community and long-term care facility located on the west end of Billings. In 2013 "AARP The Magazine" named the Billings Clinic one of the safest hospitals in America.
History.
Billings Clinic history stretches back to the founding of the Billings Clinic and Billings Deaconess Hospital. Billings Clinic evolved from the general practice of Dr. Arthur J. Movius who founded his Billings practice in 1911.
Movius was trained with a year’s internship at a Minneapolis, Minnesota hospital and had experience in the primitive surgery of the day. He, like other surgeons, depended on informal training to develop his skills: reading, medical center visits and experience.
The practice grew and by 1915, Dr. J.H. Bridenbaugh joined Movius as an assistant. Bridenbaugh took over obstetrics and the working of a strange gadget that had just been added, the x-ray machine. When Bridenbaugh went to war in 1917, he was assigned to radiology and received basic training in that field. After the war he installed new diagnostic x-ray equipment and radiation therapy—both radium and x-ray.
During the 1920s a third general practitioner joined the group. By 1930, a fourth physician with training in obstetrics was added. Shortly after, another general practitioner was added, bringing skill in the management of fractures and trauma problems. The group was known as the Movius-Bridenbaugh Clinic.
In 1939, the group devised a plan to bring in physicians as partners to the practice, and the name was changed to The Billings Clinic. Growth of the clinic after World War II required expanded facilities. In 1950 building construction began across the street from Billings Deaconess Hospital.
Billings Deaconess Hospital was incorporated in 1907 but didn’t open until after World War I. Community support was elicited to fund the project in 1922. The Reverend Charles D. Crouch was appointed by Bishop Charles Wesley Burns to complete the fundraising effort. Assuring each giver that every penny donated would be spent on the hospital; he is credited with having gathered over $75,000. The cornerstone of the building was laid in 1923, and the hospital opened on June 30, 1927.
The inception of the laboratory was in 1935. In 1950 Dr. Edwin Curtiss Segard began his sojourning at Deaconess as the first pathologist. Segard was the Laboratory Director from 1950 to 1980. Segard pioneered the implementation of quality systems and laboratory testing.
The hospital had 58 beds and a medical staff of 12 doctors and 16 nurses. One floor was used as a nurses’ residence, housing many students of the Billings Deaconess Nursing School.
As the population of Billings expanded so did the need for additional space. In 1943, a student nurse residence hall was constructed. This freed space in the hospital for more patient rooms. By 1952, the hospital added a north wing, increasing bed capacity to 144. Services were expanded to include new x-ray facilities, laboratory services, operating rooms, delivery rooms, psychotherapy services and the region’s first isotope therapy department.
By 1961, a south wing was added, increasing the number of beds to 205. The pediatrics area was also enlarged and the hospital gained a new chapel. During the 1960s and 1970s. Billings Deaconess continued to expand its services and capabilities. In 1972, the hospital pioneered Billings’ first open-heart surgery.
To better reflect the expansion of services in the region, Billings Deaconess Hospital changed its name to Deaconess Medical Center.
The Billings Clinic and Deaconess Medical Center Merge.
In 1993, the Billings Clinic and Deaconess Medical Center merged to become an integrated health care organization named Deaconess Billings Clinic. In 2001, The Family Birth Center was opened, offering a 12-suite LDRP unit, a new concept in birthing for the area.
In 2004, Digital radiology was implemented system wide; and one electronic medical record was implemented at all Billings Clinic locations.
In 2005, Deaconess Billings Clinic changed its name to Billings Clinic. In 2007, The Emergency & Trauma Center opened, offering expanded emergency and Intensive Care services.
Today the hospital has grown into a 272-bed trauma center that provides inpatient and outpatient care serving people in a four-state region. Billings Clinic is led by President and CEO, Nicholas Wolter, MD.
Billings Clinic Cancer Center.
In September 2007, Billings Clinic broke ground on its new cancer center, south of Billings Clinic. The new facility as well as the new main entrance to Billings Clinic opened August 2009.
Billings Clinic Surgery Center.
In December 2007, Billings Clinic began construction on their Surgery Center, located at the corner of 10th Avenue North and North 30th Street. The Billings Clinic Surgery Center opened in February 2009. The Surgery Center focuses on outpatient surgical procedures.

Meat slicer

A meat slicer, also called a slicing machine, deli slicer or simply a slicer, is a tool used in butcher shops and delicatessens to slice meats and cheeses. The first meat slicer was invented by Wilhelm van Berkel in Rotterdam in 1898. Older models of meat slicer may be operated by crank, while newer ones generally use an electric motor.
More recently, meat slicers have become available in the home market for people wanting to slice their own meats and cheeses.

James Joseph Dresnok

James Joseph Dresnok (born 1941) is an American defector to North Korea, one of four American soldiers to defect after the Korean War.
Dresnok worked as an actor and an English teacher in Pyongyang. He was featured on the CBS magazine program "60 Minutes" on January 28, 2007, as the last United States defector alive in North Korea, and was the subject of a documentary film entitled "Crossing the Line". 
He calls himself Joe Dresnok and has been called both James Dresnok and Joe Dresnok in news reports, sometimes both in the same report.
Early life.
Dresnok was born in Richmond, Virginia. His father was Joseph Dresnok I (1917–1978). His parents divorced when he was ten years old, and he was briefly raised by his father in Pennsylvania; his mother and younger brother Joseph Dresnok II never again came into contact with them. Dresnok was placed in a foster home, dropped out of high school, and joined the Army the day after his 17th birthday.
Defection.
Dresnok's first military service was two years in West Germany. After returning to the United States to find that his wife had left him for another man, he reenlisted and was sent to South Korea. He was a Private First Class with a U.S. Army unit along the Korean Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea in the early 1960s. Soon after his arrival, he found himself facing a court martial for forging signatures on paperwork that gave him permission to leave base and which, ultimately, led to his going AWOL (Absent Without Official Leave).
Unwilling to face punishment, on August 15, 1962, while his fellow soldiers were eating lunch, he ran across a minefield in broad daylight into North Korean territory, where he was quickly apprehended by North Korean soldiers. Dresnok was taken by train to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and interrogated.
Life in North Korea.
"I was fed up with my childhood, my marriage, my military life, everything. I was a goon. There's only one place to go," Dresnok said in an interview. "On August 15th, at noon in broad daylight when everybody was eating lunch, I hit the road. Yes I was afraid. Am I gonna live or die? And when I stepped into the minefield and I seen it with my own eyes, I started sweating. I crossed over, looking for my new life.”
Dresnok met Larry Allen Abshier, another American defector, soon after his arrival. Eventually there were four of them: Abshier, Jerry Parrish, Charles Robert Jenkins, and Dresnok. The men lived together and participated in several propaganda efforts on behalf of the North Korean government. They appeared on magazine covers and used loudspeakers to try to persuade more American soldiers at the border to defect. But they did not wish to remain in North Korea indefinitely at first. In 1966, the four men tried to leave North Korea by seeking asylum at the Soviet embassy in Pyongyang, but the embassy immediately turned them over to North Korean authorities. After that, Dresnok decided to settle in North Korea. 
Beginning in 1978, he was cast in several North Korean films, including the 20-part series "Unsung Heroes" (as an American villain), and became a celebrity in the country as a result. He is called "Arthur" by his Korean friends, after the character he played in the series. He also translated some of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung’s writings into English.
According to Jenkins's book "The Reluctant Communist", Dresnok was something of a bully, betraying the other Americans' confidences to the North Koreans, and enthusiastically beat up Jenkins 30 or more times on the orders of their Korean handlers. In the documentary "Crossing the Line", Dresnok vehemently denies these allegations.
Marriages and family.
In the United States.
In "Crossing the Line" Dresnok explains that after marrying an American woman at a young age, he was deployed in West Germany for two years while she remained in the U.S. He prided himself on "truly loving her and being loyal to her". But when he returned, he found she was already in another relationship. He was quoted as saying, "The good thing was that she did not get pregnant by me because I had promised that I would never abandon my children."
In North Korea.
He has been married twice more since defecting to North Korea. The first was to a Romanian woman, Doina Bumbea (referred to as "Dona" in Jenkins's autobiography), with whom he had two sons, Theodore "Ted" Ricardo Dresnok and James Gabriel Dresnok. Bumbea supposedly worked at the Romanian Embassy, but some accounts claim she never worked there and was an abductee taken by the North Korean secret service. 
Jenkins's book also mentions this, but claims she was abducted to be the wife of one of the American deserters. The Romanian Foreign Office's website says Romania asked North Korea in 2007 to explain Bumbea's abduction but did not receive an answer. Bumbea died of lung cancer.
After Bumbea's death, Dresnok married his third wife, the daughter of a North Korean woman and a Togolese diplomat. They had a son in 2001. The family lives in a small apartment in Pyongyang, provided along with a monthly stipend by the North Korean government. Dresnok is in failing health, with a bad heart and liver (Dresnok describes his liver as "full of fat"), which he attributes to smoking and drinking too much.
His elder son from his second marriage, James Dresnok, was a student at Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies, where his father taught English in the 1980s. James speaks English with a Korean accent and considers himself Korean but reportedly does not wish to marry a Korean woman. James intends to enter the diplomatic service.
Dresnok has stated that he intends to spend the rest of his life in North Korea, and that no amount of money could entice him back to the West. Now retired, Dresnok occasionally gives lectures in North Korea and goes fishing “just to pass the time.” He sporadically tweets under the handle @JamesDresnok, first posting back in September 2009.
Documentaries.
Dresnok is the subject of the documentary film "Crossing the Line" by British filmmakers Daniel Gordon and Nicholas Bonner, which was shown at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.
He was also featured in "An American in North Korea", a 2007 segment on "60 Minutes" by Robert G. Anderson and Casey Morgan.

Cappelen (family)

Cappelen is the surname of a prominent Norwegian family of merchants, land owners, civil servants and politicians. The family belonged to the historical Patriciate of Norway.
History.
The family originated in Cappeln near Wildeshausen in Oldenburg in Lower Saxony, Germany with Johan von Cappelen (1627–1688), who immigrated to Norway from Bremen in 1653. Johan von Cappelen bought several properties and ended as a bailiff in Lier in Buskerud County, Norway. The family's main branches originated from three of his sons:
Jørgen Wright Cappelen, a later member of the family, founded the publishing house J. W. Cappelens Forlag. The family in Norway had stopped using the "von" in the 19th century.
Coat of arms.
The family coat of arms were lawfully assumed in Norway in 1683: The shield is parted in two fields, the first and upper one having the mother pelican feeding its young with its own blood (a pelican in its piety), and the second field has three blooming roses with leaves and stems. On top of the shield is a helmet with a crest: two buffalo horns and between them the symbol of Fortune being a naked woman holding a ship's sail in her hands and standing on an orb. 
The Ulefoss-line of the family has, however, dropped Fortune and uses the two horns only. The various lines of the family have different heraldic colours (tinctures) in the arms.
In Germany the family used a merchant's mark.

Girlfriend

A girlfriend is a female partner with whom one is romantically and/or sexually involved. It can also refer to a female friend. 
Scope.
Partners in committed non-marital relationships are also sometimes described as a "significant other" or simply "partner", especially if the individuals are cohabiting.
"Girlfriend" and "partner" mean different things to different people; the distinctions between the terms are subjective. How the term is used will ultimately be determined by personal preference. 
A 2005 study of 115 people ages 21 to 35 who were either living with or had lived with a romantic partner notes that the lack of proper terms often leads to awkward situations, such as someone upset over not being introduced in social situations to avoid the question. 
There exists some ambiguity between the terms "girl friend," or a friend who is a girl, and "girlfriend." The transition between the two is a significant aspect of adolescent development.
Both forms of "girlfriend" and "girl friend" are used by different people to mean different things. For example, when the term "girlfriend" is used by a girl or woman about another female in a non-sexual, non-romantic context, the two-word form "girl friend" is sometimes used to avoid confusion with the sexual or romantic meaning; however, this is not a rule. In this sense of its usage, "girlfriend" is used in terms of very close friends and has no sexual connotations, unless it is in the case of lesbian, bisexual, or pansexual women. The term "girlfriend" is also used in LGBT communities and can refer to people of any sex or sexuality.
The term "girlfriend" does not necessarily imply a sexual relationship, but is often used to refer to a girl or woman who is dating a person she is not engaged to without indicating whether she is having sex with him or her. With differing expectations of sexual mores, the term "dating" can imply romantic activity whereas simply using "friend" would likely avoid implying such intimacy. It is essentially equivalent to the term "sweetheart", which has also been used as a term of endearment.
Word history.
The word "girlfriend" was first used in 1863 as "a woman's female friend in youth.” In 1922, the word girlfriend was used to mean a man’s sweetheart. 
"Dating" entered the American language during the Roaring Twenties. Prior to that, courtship was a matter of family and community interest. Starting around the time of the Civil War, courtship became a private matter for couples.
Distinction from "lady friend".
A similar, but not equivalent, concept is the more ambiguous "lady friend" – a companion of the female gender who is possibly less than a girlfriend but potentially more than a friend. That is to say, the relationship is not necessarily platonic, nor is it necessarily an exclusive, serious, committed, or long-term relationship. The term avoids the overt sexual implications that come with referring to a woman as someone's "mistress" or "lover". In that sense, it can often be a euphemism. The term can also sometimes be employed when someone simply does not know the exact status of a woman that a man has been associating with. For instance, tabloid headlines often note that a celebrity has been seen with a new "lady friend". "Lady friend" may also be used to signify a romantic relationship with an older woman, when the term "girl" as in "girlfriend" may be deemed age-inappropriate.
The "New York Times" style guide discourages the use of the term "girlfriend" for an adult romantic partner, stating, "Companion is a suitable term for an unmarried partner of the same or the opposite sex."

Leonard Harrison

Leonard Harrison (January 10, 1850 – January 13, 1929) was a lumberman and businessman who spent most of his life in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania and donated Leonard Harrison State Park to the state of Pennsylvania in 1922.
Early and personal life.
Harrison's maternal grandparents, William and Catherine Meek, lived in England, where his mother, Catherine, was born in 1816. The Meek family came to Wellsboro in 1833, where William was a merchant and tailor. Harrison's father William was born in New Jersey, and also came to Wellsboro in 1833, where he helped build the Tioga County courthouse. Harrison's parents met in Wellsboro, married, and had seven children, although only three survived to adulthood. Leonard Harrison was born on January 10, 1850.
Harrison attended the Wellsboro public schools and the Wellsboro Academy. He worked as a carpenter in his father's business initially, then began working as a clerk in the Wellsboro post office and for a bookstore when he was 15. From 1878 to 1884 he worked as a clerk in the Tioga County Commissioners' office, where he became familiar with land throughout the county. He began to work in the lumber business, and in 1883 began a coal business, which operated for ten years.
In 1882 Harrison married Mary Green. They lived at 10 West Avenue in Wellsboro and had three children: George, Emily, and Catherine. Emily died before 1900, and William was killed working in the family lumber business in West Virginia in 1941. Catherine never married and died in 1971. All are buried in the Wellsboro Cemetery.
Lumberman and civic leader.
Harrison was a founder of the "Tyoga Lumber Company" which owned large tracts of land for timber and coal in Nicholas County, West Virginia, as well as land in Michigan, Newfoundland, and Pennsylvania. Harrison owned a substantial amount of land in the Pine Creek Gorge. In the 1890s Harrison operated a sawmill on Pine Creek at Tiadaghton in the middle of the gorge. This mill was supplied with logs, not by train as was most common in that era, but by a log slide built into the side of the gorge. The log slide was used on a year round basis: during the winter the logs slid down on ice; following the snowmelt the slide was greased to ease the descent of the logs.
Harrison served as first president of the Wellsborough Electric Company, which was incorporated on April 11, 1894. In August 1896 Harrison was chosen president of the First National Bank of Wellsboro. He also served as clerk and burgess for the borough of Wellsboro and served for more than forty years as a school director there. Harrison helped rebuild the Wellsboro Penn Hotel in the 1920s. He was a major supporter and leader of the Wellsboro Presbyterian Church.
State park, death, and legacy.
After the village of Tiadaghton and its mill were destroyed by a fire, Harrison turned his attention to tourism. He purchased of land at the site of the current state park that bears his name in 1906. He developed this land, then known as "The Lookout", and invited the public to enjoy the beauty of the Pine Creek Gorge. Harrison donated the picnic grounds to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1922, and it is known as Leonard Harrison State Park.
Harrison died of pneumonia following surgery on January 13, 1929 at the Johns Hopkins University hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. His obituary on the front page of the Wellsboro newspaper read "Borough Loses Greatest Giver", and he was notable enough to have a brief obituary in the "New York Times".
Harrison left plans and a large bequest for the Soldiers and Sailors Hospital in Wellsboro, which was built only after his death. The state park which bears his name became very popular after a publicity campaign in the 1930s. More than 300,000 tourists visited the canyon by the autumn of 1936, and 15,000 visited Leonard Harrison over Memorial Day weekend in 1937. That year more visitors came to the Pine Creek Gorge than to Yellowstone National Park. In 2003, the park had 142,716 visitors, and Leonard Harrison State Park is part of the twenty-one state parks chosen by the DCNR Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks" list. Leonard Harrison and Colton Point State Parks are the only two parks treated as one unit for the list. The DCNR describes the parks together, noting how they "offer spectacular vistas and a fabulous view of Pine Creek Gorge, also known as Pennsylvania's Grand Canyon". It goes on to praise their inclusion in a National Natural Landmark and State Park Natural Area, hiking and trails, and the Pine Creek Rail Trail and bicycling.

<doc id="19614202" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19614202" title="Lolita">
Lolita

Lolita is a novel by Vladimir Nabokov, written in English and published in 1955 in Paris and 1958 in New York. It was later translated by its Russian-native author into Russian. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator, a 37-38 year old literature professor and hebephile Humbert Humbert, is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather. "Lolita" is his private nickname for Dolores.
The book is also notable for its writing style. The narrative is highly subjective as Humbert draws on his fragmented memories, employing a sophisticated prose style, while attempting to gain the reader's sympathy through his sincerity and melancholy, although near the end of the story Humbert refers to himself as a "maniac" who "deprived" Dolores "of her childhood", and he shortly thereafter states "the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest" in which they were involved.
After its publication, "Lolita" attained a classic status, becoming one of the best-known and most controversial examples of 20th century literature. The name "Lolita" has entered pop culture to describe a sexually precocious girl. The novel was adapted to film by Stanley Kubrick in 1962, and again in 1997 by Adrian Lyne. It has also been adapted several times for stage and has been the subject of two operas, two ballets, and an acclaimed but failed Broadway musical.
"Lolita" is included on "Time"'s List of the 100 Best Novels in English-language from 1923 to 2005. It is fourth on the Modern Library's 1998 list of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th century. It was also included in The 100 Best Books of All Time, compiled in 2002 by the Norwegian Book Club.
Plot summary.
The novel's fictional "Foreword" states that Humbert Humbert dies of coronary thrombosis upon finishing his manuscript, the events of the novel. It also states that Mrs. Richard Schiller died giving birth to a stillborn girl on Christmas Day, 1952, at the age of 17.
Humbert Humbert, a literary scholar, has harboured a long-time obsession with young girls, or "nymphets". He suggests that this was caused by the premature death of a childhood sweetheart, Annabel Leigh. After an unsuccessful marriage and a brief period in a mental hospital after a breakdown, Humbert moves to the small New England town of Ramsdale to write. He rents a room in the house of Charlotte Haze, a widow. Humbert also meets her 12-year-old daughter, Dolores (born 1935), known as "Lo", "Lola", or "Dolly", with whom he immediately becomes infatuated, partly due to her uncanny resemblance to Annabel, and privately nicknames her "Lolita". Humbert stays at the house only to remain near her.
While Dolores is away at summer camp, Charlotte, who has fallen in love with Humbert, tells him that he must either marry her or move out. Humbert agrees to marry Charlotte in order to continue living near Lolita. Charlotte is oblivious to Humbert's distaste for her, as well as his lust for Lolita, until she reads his diary. Learning of Humbert's true feelings and intentions, Charlotte plans to flee and send Lolita to a reform school, threatening to expose Humbert as a "detestable, abominable, criminal fraud." However, fate intervenes on Humbert's behalf: as she runs across the street in a state of shock, Charlotte is struck and killed by a passing car.
Humbert picks Lolita up from camp, pretending that Charlotte has been hospitalised. Rather than return to Charlotte's home, Humbert takes Lolita to a hotel, where he gives her sleeping pills. As he waits for the pills to take effect, he wanders through the hotel and meets a man who seems to know who he is. Humbert excuses himself from the strange conversation and returns to the room. There, he tries molesting Lolita but finds that the sedative is too mild. Instead, she initiates sex the next morning, after explaining that she had slept with a boy at camp. Later, Humbert reveals to Lolita that Charlotte is dead, giving her no choice but to accept her stepfather into her life on his terms or face foster care.
Lolita and Humbert drive around the country, moving from state to state and motel to motel. In order to keep Lolita from going to the police, Humbert tells her if he is arrested, she will become a ward of the state and lose all her clothes and belongings. He also bribes her for sexual favours, though he knows that she does not reciprocate his love and shares none of his interests. After a year touring North America, the two settle down in another New England town, where Lolita is enrolled in a girls' school. Humbert becomes very possessive and strict, forbidding Lolita to take part in after-school activities or to associate with boys. However, most of the townspeople see this as the action of a loving and concerned, though old-fashioned, parent.
Lolita begs to be allowed to take part in the school play, and Humbert reluctantly grants his permission in exchange for more sexual favours. The play is written by Clare Quilty. He is said to have attended a rehearsal and been impressed by Lolita's acting. Just before opening night, Lolita and Humbert have a ferocious argument, and Lolita runs away while Humbert assures the neighbours everything is fine. He searches frantically until he finds her exiting a phone booth. She is in a bright, pleasant mood, saying that she tried to reach him at home and that a "great decision has been made." They go to buy drinks and Lolita tells Humbert she doesn't care about the play and wants to resume their travels.
As Lolita and Humbert drive westward again, Humbert gets the feeling that their car is being tailed and becomes increasingly paranoid, suspecting that Lolita is conspiring with others in order to escape. She falls ill and must convalesce in a hospital while Humbert stays in a nearby motel, without Lolita for the first time in years. One night, Lolita disappears from the hospital, with the staff telling Humbert that her "uncle" checked her out. Humbert embarks upon a frantic search to find Lolita and her abductor, but eventually gives up. During this time, Humbert has a two-year relationship (ending in 1952) with a woman named Rita, whom he describes as a "kind, good sport" who "solemnly approve" of his search for Lolita, while knowing none of the details.
Humbert receives a letter from Lolita, now 17, who tells him that she is married (making her name now Dolores Schiller), pregnant, and in desperate need of money. Humbert goes to see Lolita, giving her money in exchange for the name of the man who abducted her. She reveals the truth: Clare Quilty checked her out of the hospital after following them throughout their travels and tried to make her star in one of his pornographic films. When she refused, he threw her out. She worked odd jobs before meeting and marrying her husband, who knows nothing about her past. Humbert asks Lolita to leave her husband, Dick, and live with him, which she refuses to do. He gives her a large sum of money anyway, which secures her future. As he leaves she smiles and shouts goodbye in a "sweet, American" way.
Humbert finds Quilty, whom he intends to kill, at his mansion. Before doing so, he first wants Quilty to understand why he must die, for he took advantage of Humbert, a sinner, and he took advantage of a disadvantage. Eventually, Humbert shoots him dead, and exits the house. Shortly afterward, he is arrested for driving on the wrong side of the road and swerving. The narrative closes with Humbert's final words to Lolita in which he wishes her well, and reveals the novel in its metafiction to be the memoirs of his life, only to be published after he and Lolita have both died.
Erotic motifs and controversy.
"Lolita" is frequently described as an "erotic novel", both by some critics but also in a standard reference work on literature "Facts on File: Companion to the American Short Story." "The Great Soviet Encyclopedia" called "Lolita" "an experiment in combining an erotic novel with an instructive novel of manners." The same description of the novel is found in Desmond Morris's reference work "The Book of Ages". A survey of books for Women's Studies courses describes it as a "tongue-in-cheek erotic novel". Books focused on the history of erotic literature such as Michael Perkins' "The Secret Record: Modern Erotic Literature" also so classify "Lolita".
More cautious classifications have included a "novel with erotic motifs" or one of "a number of works of classical erotic literature and art, and to novels that contain elements of eroticism, like ... "Ulysses" and "Lady Chatterley's Lover"".
However, this classification has been disputed. Malcolm Bradbury writes "at first famous as an erotic novel, "Lolita" soon won its way as a literary one—a late modernist distillation of the whole crucial mythology." Samuel Schuman says that Nabokov "is a surrealist, linked to Gogol, Dostoevsky, and Kafka. "Lolita" is characterized by irony and sarcasm. It is not an erotic novel".
Lance Olsen writes "The first 13 chapters of the text, culminating with the oft-cited scene of Lo unwittingly stretching her legs across Humbert's excited lap [...] are the only chapters suggestive of the erotic." Nabokov himself observes in the novel's afterword that a few readers were "misled. the opening of the book...into assuming this was going to be a lewd book... the rising succession of erotic scenes; when these stopped, the readers stopped, too, and felt bored."
Style and interpretation.
The novel is a tragicomedy narrated by Humbert, who riddles the narrative with word play and his wry observations of American culture. His humour provides an effective counterpoint to the pathos of the tragic plot. The novel's flamboyant style is characterised by double entendres, multilingual puns, anagrams, and coinages such as "nymphet", a word that has since had a life of its own and can be found in most dictionaries, and the lesser-used "faunlet". One of the novel's characters, "Vivian Darkbloom", is an anagram of the author's name.
Several times, the narrator begs the reader to understand that he is not proud of his rape of Lolita and is filled with remorse. At one point he listens to the sounds of children playing outdoors, and is stricken with guilt at the realisation that he robbed Lolita of her childhood. When he is reunited with the 17-year-old Lolita, he realises that he still loves her, even though she no longer is the nymphet of his dreams.
Some critics have accepted Humbert's version of events at face value. In 1959, novelist Robertson Davies excused the narrator entirely, writing that the theme of "Lolita" is "not the corruption of an innocent child by a cunning adult, but the exploitation of a weak adult by a corrupt child. This is no pretty theme, but it is one with which social workers, magistrates and psychiatrists are familiar."
Most writers, however, have given less credit to Humbert and more to Nabokov's powers as an ironist. For Richard Rorty, in his interpretation of "Lolita" in "Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity", Humbert is a "monster of incuriosity." Nabokov himself described Humbert as "a vain and cruel wretch" and "a hateful person."
In his essay on Stalinism "Koba the Dread", Martin Amis proposes that "Lolita" is an elaborate metaphor for the totalitarianism that destroyed the Russia of Nabokov's childhood (though Nabokov states in his afterword that he " symbols and allegories"). Amis interprets it as a story of tyranny told from the point of view of the tyrant. "Nabokov, in all his fiction, writes with incomparable penetration about delusion and coercion, about cruelty and lies," he says. "Even "Lolita", especially "Lolita", is a study in tyranny."
Critics have further noted that the novel gives very little information about what Lolita is personally like, that in effect she has been silenced. Nomi Tamir-Ghez writes "Not only is Lolita's voice silenced, her point of view, the way she sees the situation and feels about it, is rarely mentioned and can be only surmised by the reader...since it is Humbert who tells the story...throughout most of the novel, the reader is absorbed in Humbert's feelings". Similarly Mica Howe and Sarah Appleton Aguiar write that the novel silences and objectifies Lolita. Christine Clegg notes that this is a recurring theme in criticism of the novel in the 1990s. Actor Brian Cox, who played Humbert in a 2009 one-man stage monologue based on the novel, stated that the novel is "not about Lolita as a flesh and blood entity. It's Lolita as a memory". He concluded that a stage monologue would be truer to the book than any film could possibly be. Elizabeth Janeway writing in "The New York Review of Books" holds "Humbert is every man who is driven by desire, wanting his Lolita so badly that it never occurs to him to consider her as a human being, or as anything but a dream-figment made flesh".
Clegg sees the novel's non-disclosure of Lolita's feelings as directly linked to the fact that her "real" name is Dolores and (in the novel but not the film) only Humbert refers to her as Lolita. Humbert also states he has effectively "solipsized" Lolita early in the novel. Eric Lemay of Northwestern University writes:
The human child, the one noticed by non-nymphomaniacs, answers to other names, "Lo," "Lola," "Dolly," and, least alluring of all, "Dolores." "But in my arms," asserts Humbert, "she was always Lolita." And in his arms or out, "Lolita" was always the creation of Humbert's craven self... The Siren-like Humbert sings a song of himself, to himself, and titles that self and that song "Lolita." ... To transform Dolores into Lolita, to seal this sad adolescent within his musky self, Humbert must deny her her humanity.
In 2003 Iranian expatriate Azar Nafisi published the memoir "Reading Lolita in Tehran" about a covert women's reading group. In an NPR interview Nafasi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of Dolores/Lolita's character. She notes "Because her name is not Lolita, her real name is Dolores which as you know in Latin means dolour, so her real name is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence, while Lolita becomes a sort of light-headed, seductive, and airy name. The Lolita of our novel is both of these at the same time and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect of that little girl and the crassest interpretation of her." Following Nafasi's comments, the NPR interviewer, Madeleine Brand, lists as embodiments of the latter side of Lolita, "the Long Island Lolita, Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's "Lolita"".
For Nafisi, the essence of the novel is Humbert's solipsism and his erasure of Lolita's independent identity. She writes: "Lolita was given to us as Humbert's creature [...] To reinvent her, Humbert must take from Lolita her own real history and replace it with his own [...] Yet she does have a past. Despite Humbert's attempts to orphan Lolita by robbing her of her history, that past is still given to us in glimpses."
One of the novel's early champions, Lionel Trilling, warned in 1958 of the moral difficulty in interpreting a book with so eloquent and so self-deceived a narrator: "we find ourselves the more shocked when we realize that, in the course of reading the novel, we have come virtually to condone the violation it presents [...] we have been seduced into conniving in the violation, because we have permitted our fantasies to accept what we know to be revolting."
Publication and reception.
Nabokov finished "Lolita" on 6 December 1953, five years after starting it. Because of its subject matter, Nabokov intended to publish it pseudonymously (although the anagrammatic character Vivian Darkbloom would tip off the alert reader). The manuscript was turned down, with more or less regret, by Viking, Simon & Schuster, New Directions, Farrar, Straus, and Doubleday. After these refusals and warnings, he finally resorted to publication in France. Via his translator Doussia Ergaz, it reached Maurice Girodias of Olympia Press, "three quarters of list was pornographic trash". Underinformed about Olympia, overlooking hints of Girodias's approval of the conduct of a protagonist Girodias presumed was based on the author, and despite warnings from Morris Bishop, his friend at Cornell, Nabokov signed a contract with Olympia Press for publication of the book, to come out under his own name.
"Lolita" was published in September 1955, as a pair of green paperbacks "swarming with typographical errors". Although the first printing of 5,000 copies sold out, there were no substantial reviews. Eventually, at the very end of 1955, Graham Greene, in the (London) "Sunday Times", called it one of the three best books of 1955. This statement provoked a response from the (London) "Sunday Express", whose editor John Gordon called it "the filthiest book I have ever read" and "sheer unrestrained pornography." British Customs officers were then instructed by a panicked Home Office to seize all copies entering the United Kingdom. In December 1956, France followed suit, and the Minister of the Interior banned "Lolita"; the ban lasted for two years. Its eventual British publication by Weidenfeld & Nicolson caused a scandal that contributed to the end of the political career of one of the publishers, Nigel Nicolson.
The novel then appeared in Danish and Dutch translations (two editions of a Swedish translation were withdrawn at the author's request).
Despite initial trepidation, there was no official response in the U.S., and the first American edition was issued by G.P. Putnam's Sons in August 1958. The book was into a third printing within days and became the first since "Gone with the Wind" to sell 100,000 copies in its first three weeks.
The novel continues to generate controversy today as modern society has become increasingly aware of the lasting damage created by child sexual abuse. In 2008, an entire book was published on the best ways to teach the novel in a college classroom given that "its particular mix of narrative strategies, ornate allusive prose, and troublesome subject matter complicates its presentation to students." In this book one author urges teachers to note that Lolita's suffering is noted in the book even if the main focus is on Humbert. Many critics describe Humbert as a rapist, notably Azar Nafisi in her best-selling "Reading Lolita in Tehran", though in a survey of critics David Larmour notes that other interpreters of the novel have been reluctant to use that term. Near the end of the novel, Humbert accuses himself of rape – however, after noting this Nabokov biographer Brian Boyd tries to let Humbert off the hook on the grounds that Dolores was not a virgin and seduced Humbert in the morning of their hotel stay although sex had been suggested by Humbert earlier. This perspective is vigorously disputed by Peter Rabinowitz in his essay "Lolita: Solipsized or Sodomized?".
Today, "Lolita" is considered by many to be one of the finest novels written in the 20th century. In 1998, it came fourth in a list by the Modern Library of the greatest English-language novels of the 20th century.
Sources and links.
Links in Nabokov's work.
In 1939 Nabokov wrote a novella, "Volshebnik" (Волшебник), that was published only posthumously in 1986 in English translation as "The Enchanter". It bears many similarities to "Lolita", but also has significant differences: It takes place in Central Europe, and the protagonist is unable to consummate his passion with his stepdaughter, leading to his suicide. The theme of ephebophilia was already touched on by Nabokov in his short story "A Nursery Tale", written in 1926. Also, in the 1932 "Laughter in the Dark", Margot Peters is 16 and already had an affair when middle-aged Albinus becomes attracted to her.
In chapter three of the novel "The Gift" (written in Russian in 1935–1937) the similar gist of "Lolita"s first chapter is outlined to the protagonist, Fyodor Cherdyntsev, by his obnoxious landlord Shchyogolev as an idea of a novel he would write "if I only had the time": a man marries a widow only to gain access to her young daughter, who resists all his passes. Shchyogolev says it happened "in reality" to a friend of his; it is made clear to the reader that it concerns himself and his stepdaughter Zina (15 at the time of Shchyogolev's marriage to her mother) who becomes the love of Fyodor's life.
In April 1947, Nabokov wrote to Edmund Wilson: "I am writing ... a short novel about a man who liked little girls—and it's going to be called "The Kingdom by the Sea"..." The work expanded into "Lolita" during the next eight years. Nabokov used the title "A Kingdom by the Sea" in his 1974 pseudo-autobiographical novel "Look at the Harlequins!" for a "Lolita"-like book written by the narrator who, in addition, travels with his teenage daughter Bel from motel to motel after the death of her mother; later, his fourth wife is Bel's look-alike and shares her birthday.
In Nabokov's 1962 novel "Pale Fire", the titular poem by fictional John Shade mentions Hurricane Lolita coming up the American east coast in 1958, and narrator Charles Kinbote (in the commentary later in the book) notes it, questioning why anyone would have chosen an obscure Spanish nickname for a hurricane. There were no hurricanes named Lolita that year, but that is the year that "Lolita" the novel was published in North America.
The unfinished novel "The Original of Laura", published posthumously, features the character Hubert H. Hubert, an older man preying upon then-child protagonist, Flora. Unlike those of Humbert Humbert in "Lolita", Hubert's advances are unsuccessful.
Literary pastiches, allusions and prototypes.
The novel abounds in allusions to classical and modern literature. Virtually all of them have been noted in "The Annotated Lolita" edited and annotated by Alfred Appel, Jr. Many are references to Humbert's own favourite poet, Edgar Allan Poe.
Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, is named after the "maiden" in the poem "Annabel Lee" by Poe; this poem is alluded to many times in the novel, and its lines are borrowed to describe Humbert's love. A passage in chapter 11 reuses Poe's phrase "...by the side of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride". In the opening of the novel, the phrase "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied," is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the "winged seraphs of heaven" (line 11), and "The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me" (lines 21–2). Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called "The Kingdom by the Sea", drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads "...had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea".
Humbert Humbert's double name recalls Poe's "William Wilson", a tale in which the main character is haunted by his doppelgänger, paralleling to the presence of Humbert's own doppelgänger, Clare Quilty. Humbert is not, however, his real name, but a chosen pseudonym. The theme of the doppelgänger also occurs in Nabokov's earlier novel, "Despair".
Chapter 26 of Part One contains a parody of Joyce's stream of consciousness.
Humbert Humbert's field of expertise is French literature (one of his jobs is writing a series of educational works that compare French writers to English writers), and as such there are several references to French literature, including the authors Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, François Rabelais, Charles Baudelaire, Prosper Mérimée, Remy Belleau, Honoré de Balzac, and Pierre de Ronsard.
Vladimir Nabokov was fond of Lewis Carroll and had translated "Alice in Wonderland" into Russian. He even called Carroll the "first Humbert Humbert". "Lolita" contains a few brief allusions in the text to the "Alice" books, though overall Nabokov avoided direct allusions to Carroll. In her book, "Tramp: The Life of Charlie Chaplin", Joyce Milton claims that a major inspiration for the novel was Charlie Chaplin's relationship with his second wife, Lita Grey, whose real name was Lillita and is often misstated as Lolita. Graham Vickers in his book "Chasing Lolita: How Popular Culture Corrupted Nabokov's Little Girl All Over Again" argues that the two major real-world predecessors of Humbert are Lewis Carroll and Charlie Chaplin. Although Appel's comprehensive "Annotated Lolita" contains no references to Charlie Chaplin, others have picked up several oblique references to Chaplin's life in Nabokov's book. Bill Delaney notes that at the end Lolita and her husband move to the Alaskan town of Grey Star while Chaplin's "The Gold Rush", set in Alaska, was originally set to star Lita Grey. Lolita's first sexual encounter was with a boy named Charlie Holmes, whom Humbert describes as "the silent...but indefatigable Charlie." Chaplin had an artist paint Lita Grey in imitation of Joshua Reynolds's painting "The Age of Innocence". When Humbert visits Lolita in a class at her school, he notes a print of the same painting in the classroom. Delaney's article notes many other parallels as well.
The foreword refers to "the monumental decision rendered December 6, 1933 by Hon. John M. Woolsey in regard to another, considerably more outspoken book"—that is, the decision in the case "United States v. One Book Called Ulysses", in which Woolsey ruled that James Joyce's "Ulysses" was not obscene and could be sold in the United States.
In chapter 29 of Part Two, Humbert comments that Lolita looks "like Botticelli's russet Venus—the same soft nose, the same blurred beauty", referencing Sandro Botticelli's depiction of Venus in, perhaps, "The Birth of Venus" or "Venus and Mars".
In chapter 35 of Part Two, Humbert's "death sentence" on Quilty parodies the rhythm and use of anaphora in T. S. Eliot's poem "Ash Wednesday."
Many other references to classical and Romantic literature abound, including references to Lord Byron's "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" and to the poetry of Laurence Sterne.
Other possible real-life prototypes.
In addition to the possible prototypes of Lewis Carroll and Charlie Chaplin mentioned above in Allusions, Alexander Dolinin suggests that the prototype of Lolita was 11-year-old Florence Horner, kidnapped in 1948 by 50-year-old mechanic Frank La Salle, who had caught her stealing a five-cent notebook. La Salle travelled with her over various states for 21 months and is believed to have raped her. He claimed that he was an FBI agent and threatened to "turn her in" for the theft and to send her to "a place for girls like you." The Horner case was not widely reported, but Dolinin notes various similarities in events and descriptions.
While Nabokov had already used the same basic idea—that of a child molester and his victim booking into a hotel as father and daughter—in his then-unpublished 1939 work "Volshebnik" ("Волшебник"), the Horner case is mentioned explicitly in Chapter 33 of Part II:
Heinz von Lichberg's "Lolita".
German academic Michael Maar's book "The Two Lolitas" describes his recent discovery of a 1916 German short story titled "Lolita" whose middle-aged narrator describes travelling abroad as a student. He takes a room as a lodger and instantly becomes obsessed with the preteen girl (also named Lolita) who lives in the same house. Maar has speculated that Nabokov may have had cryptomnesia (a "hidden memory" of the story that Nabokov was unaware of) while he was composing "Lolita" during the 1950s. Maar says that until 1937 Nabokov lived in the same section of Berlin as the author, Heinz von Eschwege (pen name: Heinz von Lichberg), and was most likely familiar with his work, which was widely available in Germany during Nabokov's time there. "The Philadelphia Inquirer", in the article ""Lolita" at 50: Did Nabokov take literary liberties?" says that, according to Maar, accusations of plagiarism should not apply and quotes him as saying: "Literature has always been a huge crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast... Nothing of what we admire in "Lolita" is already to be found in the tale; the former is in no way deducible from the latter." See also Jonathan Lethem in "Harper's Magazine" on this story.
Nabokov on "Lolita".
Afterword.
In 1956 Nabokov wrote an afterword to "Lolita" ("On a Book Entitled "Lolita""), that first appeared in the first U.S. edition and has appeared thereafter.
One of the first things Nabokov makes a point of saying is that, despite John Ray Jr.'s claim in the Foreword, there is no moral to the story.
Nabokov adds that "the initial shiver of inspiration" for "Lolita" "was somehow prompted by a newspaper story about an ape in the Jardin des Plantes who, after months of coaxing by a scientist, produced the first drawing ever charcoaled by an animal: this sketch showed the bars of the poor creature's cage". Neither the article nor the drawing has been recovered.
In response to an American critic who characterized "Lolita" as the record of Nabokov's "love affair with the romantic novel", Nabokov writes that "the substitution of 'English language' for 'romantic novel' would make this elegant formula more correct".
Nabokov concludes the afterword with a reference to his beloved first language, which he abandoned as a writer once he moved to the United States in 1940: "My private tragedy, which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile Russian language for a second-rate brand of English".
Estimation.
Nabokov rated the book highly. In an interview for BBC Television in 1962, he said:
"Lolita" is a special favorite of mine. It was my most difficult book—the book that treated of a theme which was so distant, so remote, from my own emotional life that it gave me a special pleasure to use my combinational talent to make it real.
Over a year later, in an interview for "Playboy", he said:
I shall never regret "Lolita". She was like the composition of a beautiful puzzle—its composition and its solution at the same time, since one is a mirror view of the other, depending on the way you look. Of course she completely eclipsed my other works—at least those I wrote in English: "The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Bend Sinister", my short stories, my book of recollections; but I cannot grudge her this. There is a queer, tender charm about that mythical nymphet.
In the same year, in an interview with "Life", Nabokov was asked which of his writings had most pleased him. He answered:
I would say that of all my books "Lolita" has left me with the most pleasurable afterglow—perhaps because it is the purest of all, the most abstract and carefully contrived. I am probably responsible for the odd fact that people don't seem to name their daughters Lolita any more. I have heard of young female poodles being given that name since 1956, but of no human beings.
Russian translation.
Nabokov translated "Lolita" into Russian; the translation was published by Phaedra Publishers in New York in 1967.
The translation includes a "Postscriptum" in which Nabokov reconsiders his relationship with his native language. Referring to the afterword to the English edition, Nabokov states that only "the scientific scrupulousness led me to preserve the last paragraph of the American afterword in the Russian text..." He further explains that the "story of this translation is the story of a disappointment. Alas, that 'wonderful Russian language' which, I imagined, still awaits me somewhere, which blooms like a faithful spring behind the locked gate to which I, after so many years, still possess the key, turned out to be non-existent, and there is nothing beyond that gate, except for some burned out stumps and hopeless autumnal emptiness, and the key in my hand looks rather like a lock pick."
Adaptations.
"Lolita" has been filmed twice, been a musical, four stage-plays, one completed opera, and two ballets. There is also Nabokov's unfilmed (and re-edited) screenplay, an uncompleted opera based on the work, and an "imagined opera" which combines elements of opera and dance.

Same-sex marriage in Spain

Same-sex marriage in Spain has been legal since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, began a campaign for its legalization, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples. After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage was passed by the "Cortes Generales" (Spain's bicameral parliament, composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005. The law took effect the next day, making Spain the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of Canada.
The ratification of this law was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what they regarded as the weakening of the meaning of marriage. Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children. Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain. After its approval, the conservative People's Party challenged the law in the Constitutional Court.
Approximately 4,500 same-sex couples married in Spain during the first year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.
The November 2011 general election delivered a landslide victory to the People's Party, whose leader Mariano Rajoy said that he opposed same-sex marriage, but any decision about repealing the law could be made only after the ruling of the Constitutional Court. On 6 November 2012, the law was upheld by the Court with 8 support votes and 3 against. Minister of Justice Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón announced that, the government will abide the ruling and the law will not be repealed.
History.
During the 1990s and early 2000s, several city councils and autonomous communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although the effect was mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 12 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003) and Cantabria (2005). Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.
The Socialist Party (PSOE) manifesto for the 2004 general election included the pledge of amending the Civil Code to legalize same-sex marriage, granting it the same status as heterosexual marriage in order to "ensure full social and legal equality for lesbians and gays". After the socialists' victory in the election, the new Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero promised at his inauguration address to bring this change forward: "The moment has finally arrived to end once and for all the intolerable discrimination which many Spaniards suffer because of their sexual preferences. (...) As a result, we will modify the Civil Code to recognize their equal right to marriage with the resulting effects over inheritance, labor rights and social security protection". On 30 June 2004, the then Minister of Justice Juan Fernando López Aguilar announced that the Congress of Deputies had provisionally approved a government plan for legislation to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples. López Aguilar also announced two propositions, introduced by the regional Convergence and Union party of Catalonia: one introduced legal status for both opposite- and same-sex common-law unions ("parejas de hecho", "de facto unions"), while the other permitted transgendered people to legally change their name and sex designation without the requirement of surgery.
The bill regarding same-sex marriage was approved by the Cabinet on 1 October 2004, submitted to Parliament on 31 December, and passed by the Congress of Deputies on 21 April 2005. However, it was rejected on 22 June 2005 by the Senate, where the opposition People's Party held a plurality of the seats. The bill was returned to the lower house, which holds the power to override the Senate, and final approval was given to the bill on 30 June 2005 with 187 "yes" votes, 147 "no" votes, and 4 abstentions.
With the final approval, and enactment of the bill on 2 July 2005, Spain became the third country in the world to formally legalize same-sex marriages nationwide, after the Netherlands and Belgium.
The first same-sex wedding took place eight days after the bill became law, and was celebrated in the council chamber in the Madrid suburb of Tres Cantos by Carlos Baturín and Emilio Menéndez. The first same-sex marriage between women took place in Barcelona eleven days later.
In spite of these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if children were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the government amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother to be regarded as a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.
Ratification of Law 13/2005.
The projected bill announced on 30 June 2004 by the Minister of Justice was studied by the General Council of the Judiciary. Although the General Council admitted that the existing discrimination against homosexuals could not be condoned, it was quite critical about extending marriage toward same-sex couples (including collateral adoption). It argued that the extension was not demanded by the Constitution, and that ending discrimination could be achieved through other legal means, such as the extension of civil unions.
Despite this negative report, the government presented the bill to Congress on 1 October 2004. With the exception of the People's Party and members of the Democratic Union of Catalonia, the different parliamentary parties favoured the reform. On 21 April 2005, Congress approved the bill, with 183 "yes" and 136 "no" votes and 6 abstentions (including a member of the People's Party). The bill to allow same-sex marriage in Spain was short: it added a new paragraph to article 44 of the civil code, saying that "Matrimony shall have the same requisites and effects regardless of whether the persons involved are of the same or different sex".
In accordance with constitutional provisions, the text approved by the Congress was then submitted to the Senate for final approval, change or veto. On 21 June 2005 experts were called to the Senate to debate the issue. The expert's opinions were diverse; some stated that gay adoption had no effect on a child's development, except for perhaps a higher tolerance towards homosexuality. However, psychiatrist Aquilino Polaino, called by the People's Party as an expert, called homosexuality a pathology and emotive disorder. Among other assertions that generated debate, he claimed that "many homosexuals have rape abuse antecedents since childhood" and that homosexuals generally come from families with "hostile, alcoholic and distant" fathers, and mothers who were "over protective" toward boys and "cold" toward girls. Prominent People's Party members later rejected Polaino's assertions.
The Senate vetoed the text submitted by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held the majority of the seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 "yes" and 119 "no" votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005 it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 "yes" votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 "no" votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of parliament to speak in its support, saying "We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends and our relatives. At the same time, we are building a more decent society." Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.
When the media asked King Juan Carlos if he would sign the bill that was being debated in the "Cortes Generales", he answered that he was the King of Spain, not of Belgiuma reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. For the king to withhold his royal assent would effect a veto of the legislation. However, the king gave his Royal Assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005, and the law was gazetted in the "Boletín Oficial del Estado" on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. The king received criticism by Carlist and other far right conservatives for signing the legislation.
Reactions.
The bill's passage was met with concern by Catholic authorities, including Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, even if it meant losing their jobs.
Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Crown Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe this may be due to the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.
Prime Minister Zapatero responded to Church criticism by saying:
On 19 June 2005 there was a public protest against the law. Protesters — led by People's Party members, Spanish bishops and the Spanish Family Forum ("Foro Español de la Familia") — said they had rallied 1.5 million people against what they considered an attack on the traditional family; the Government's Delegation in Madrid counted 166,000 at the same event. Two weeks after this protest, coinciding with Gay Pride Day, FELGT ("Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales" — the Spanish Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Organization) estimated two million people marched in favour of the new law; police sources counted 97,000. Both marches took place in Madrid, at the time governed by the conservative People's Party.
Spanish bishops also claimed that the government, by extending the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of gay couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed for a long time in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre, Asturias, Aragon, the Basque Country, and Catalonia before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide.
These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.
In a 2008 biography, Queen Sofia of Spain revealed that she preferred the term "civil union" to "marriage" for committed same-gender relationships. This and other alleged comments by the queen opened the Spanish monarchy to rare criticism in 2008, with the Zarzuela palace issuing an apology on behalf of the queen for the "inexact" quotes attributed to her. Antonio Poveda, president of FELGT, said his organization accepted the queen's apology, but added that there remains ill feelings by the gay community towards the queen over the comments. King Juan Carlos, known to be far more liberal than his wife, was reportedly incensed by the biography, with reporters stating the king will fire palace officials who allegedly approved official royal endorsement of the book.
During the 2011 General Election, People's Party leader and Prime Minister of Spain Mariano Rajoy stated he also prefers the term "civil union" to marriage for same-sex couples.
Opposition court challenges.
On 21 July 2005, a judge from the city of Dénia refused to issue a marriage license to a lesbian couple. The judge also filed a constitutional challenge against the same-sex marriage law with the Constitutional Court based on Article 32 of the Constitution that contains the phrase "Men and women have the right to contract marriage with full juridical equality."
In August 2005, a judge from Gran Canaria refused licenses to three same-sex couples and mounted another constitutional challenge. In December 2005, the Constitutional Court rejected both challenges owing to both judges' lack of standing to file them. On 30 September 2005, the opposition People's Party decided to initiate a separate constitutional challenge, causing division within the party. The outcome was published on November 6, 2012, seven years after the challenge was presented. The Court decided to uphold the same-sex marriage law with 8 support votes and 3 against.
On 27 February 2007 the Spanish Family Forum presented an initiative signed by 1.5 million people to legislate marriage as the union of a man and a woman only (thus effectively prohibiting same-sex marriage). The initiative was rejected by the Spanish Congress.
On 30 May 2007, the aforementioned judge of Dénia was condemned by the Disciplinary Committee of the General Council of Judiciary Power ("Comisión Disciplinaria del Consejo General del Poder Judicial -CGPJ-") to pay 305 euros for refusing to marry a gay couple and was also strictly warned against doing it again. She attributes this action to the "propagandistic machinery" of the government.
Residency issues.
Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license on the grounds that India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.
On 27 July, the "Junta de Fiscales de Sala" – a body within the Public Prosecutor's Corp that advises the Minister of Justice's office – issued an opinion that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Spaniards can marry foreigners from countries that do not permit same-sex marriage. This marriage would be valid according to Spanish law, but did not imply automatic validity according to the foreigner's national law. A ruling published in the Official State Bulletin stated:
According to the instructions from the Ministry of Justice ("Dirección General de Registros y Notariado"), Spanish Consulates abroad may carry out the preliminary paperwork for a same-sex marriage. At least one of the marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen, residing in the Consular demarcation. However, the marriage itself can only take place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same-sex marriages (Spanish consulates in Boston, Brussels, The Hague, Amsterdam, Oslo, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Cape Town, Pretoria, Stockholm, Washington, D.C., Mexico City, Lisbon, Porto, Reykjavík, Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba and Mendoza, as of August 2010). In all other cases, the partners must marry in Spanish territory. Two non-resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as at least one of the partners must be a Spanish resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.
Marriage statistics.
[[Image:Matrimonios homosexuales en España 2008.svg|thumb|300 px|Marriage rates of same-sex marriages in Spain in 2008
According to the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE), 27,357 same-sex marriages took place up to the end of 2012: 1,275 in 2005, 4,574 in 2006, 3,250 in 2007, 3,549 in 2008, 3,412 in 2009, 3,583 in 2010, 3,880 in 2011 and 3,834 in 2012.
Most same-sex marriages in 2011 took place in: Catalonia, with 886 weddings (3.33% of all marriages in the Community for that year); Madrid, 729 (2.91%); Andalusia, 484 (1.71%); Valencian Community, 436 (2.58%); and the Canary Islands, 203 (3.60%).
Notable weddings.
Since its legalization in 2005, couples from a cross section of Spanish society have entered into same-sex marriage. Within the first year the law received royal assent, an influential socialist leader and Madrid city councilor Pedro Zerolo married Jesús Santos in January, and popular television presenter Jesús Vázquez married Roberto Cortés in March. In October 2005, Spain's prominent anti-terrorism judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska married his fiancé Gorka Gomez. In August 2006 Ourense city councilor and member of the People's Party Pepe Araujo, whose party originally opposed the law, married his fiancé Nino Crespo. In September 2006 Alberto Linero Marchena and Alberto Sánchez Fernández, both army soldiers assigned to the Morón Air Base near Seville, became Spain's first military personnel to marry under the new law. In August 2008, Doña Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, 21st Duchess of Medina Sidonia and three-time Grandee of Spain (branded the "Red Duchess" for her socialist activism), became the highest ranking Spanish noble to marry in an "articulo mortis" (deathbed) wedding to longtime companion Liliana Maria Dahlmann, now the Dowager Duchess of Medina Sidonia by right of her late wife.
Public opinion.
A poll by the government-run Centre for Sociological Investigations ("Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas"), published in April 2005, reported that 66% of Spaniards favoured legalising same-sex marriage. Another poll taken by "Instituto Opina" a day before the bill passed placed support of the same-sex marriage bill at 62.1% and support of adoption by same-sex couples at 49.1%. An "Instituto Opina" poll taken nine months after the bill passed said 61% agreed with the government's decision.
On 25 July 2007 the BBVA Foundation published their report "Social portrait of Spanish people", which reported that 60% of Spain's population support same-sex marriage. This support occurs mainly among the younger population, between 15 and 34 years old (75%), people with higher education (71%), people not attached to any religion (75.5%), and those identified by left and centre-left political views (71.9%). However, only 44% of the population favor the right of adoption by homosexual couples, in contrast to 42% opposition.
A May 2013 Ipsos poll found that 76% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage and another 13% supported other form of recognition for same-sex couples.
According to the Ifop poll, conducted in May 2013, 71% of Spaniards supported allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children.

Moomin

The Moomins (, ) are the central characters in a series of books and a comic strip by Swedish-Finn illustrator and writer Tove Jansson, originally published in Swedish by Schildts in Finland. They are a family of white, roundish fairy tale characters with large snouts that make them resemble hippopotamuses. The carefree and adventurous family live in their house in Moominvalley, though in the past their temporary residences have included a lighthouse and a theatre. They have had many adventures along with their various friends.
In all, nine books were released in the series, with five picture books and a comic strip being released between 1945 and 1993.
The Moomins have since been the basis for numerous television series, films and even a theme park called Moomin World in Naantali, Finland.
Synopsis and characters.
The Moomin stories concern several eccentric and oddly-shaped characters, some of whom are related to each other. The central family consists of Moominpappa, Moominmamma and Moomintroll.
Other characters, such as Hemulen, Sniff, The Snork maiden, Snufkin and Little My are accepted into or attach themselves to the family group from time to time, generally living separate lives in the surrounding Moominvalley, where the series is set. It is in this fictional valley, that the Moomin family decides to live at the end of "The Moomins and the Great Flood".
Characters.
Moominpappa: Father of the family, but boyish and adventurous. He likes to be present when something unusual happens. He is philosophical at times and likes writing his memoirs.
Moominmamma: The calm mother, who takes care that Moominhouse is a safe place to be. She wants everyone to be happy, appreciates individuality, but settles things when someone is wronged. She always brings good food as well as whatever else may be necessary on a journey in her handbag.
Moomintroll also referred to as "Moomin" in some of the English translations: The little boy of the family, interested in and excited about everything he sees and finds, always trying to be good, but sometimes getting into trouble while doing so, he is very brave and always finds a way to make his friends happy. 
The Hemulens: Creatures that believe in order and like to boss other people around, but find it difficult to listen to anyone and lack a sense of humor. Many hemulens like collecting stuff, and have little time to think about much else.
Sniff: A small creature, who lives in the Moomin house. He likes to take part in everything, but is afraid to do anything dangerous. Sniff appreciates all valuables and makes many plans to get rich, but does not succeed.
Snork Maiden: Moomin’s girlfriend. She is happy and energetic, but often suddenly changes her mind on things. She loves nice clothes and jewelry and is a little flirtatious.
The Snork: Snorkmaiden’s brother. He is an introvert by nature and is always inventing things. The residents of Moominvalley often ask Snork for help solving tricky problems and building machines. Snorks are like moomintrolls, but change colour according to their mood.
Snufkin: Moomin's best friend. The lonesome philosophical traveller, who likes to play the harmonica and wanders around the world with only a few things, so as not to make his life complicated. He always comes and goes as he pleases, is carefree and has lots of admirers in Moominvalley. He is also shown to be quite fearless and calm in even the most dire situations, which has proven to be a great help to Moomintroll and the others when in danger.
Little My: A mischievous tomboyish little girl, who lives in the Moomin house and has a brave, spunky personality. She likes adventure, but loves catastrophes, and often does mean things on purpose. She finds messiness and untidiness exciting and is very down to earth, when others aren’t.
The younger Mymble, also referred to as "the Mymble's daughter": Little My’s amiable and helpful big sister, and half-sister of Snufkin. She often has romantic daydreams about the love of her life, particularly policemen.
Too-Ticky: A wise woman, and good friend of the family. She has a boyish look, with a blue hat and a red-striped shirt. She dives straight into action to solve dilemmas in a practical way. Too Ticky is the one of the people in Moominvalley, who does not hibernate, instead spending the winter in the cozy sauna building of the Moominhouse. 
Mrs Fillyjonk: A female rodent-like being who believes order and principle are vital to life, and she does not want her three children to learn bad habits. She easily loses her temper and even the slightest misfortune depresses her. She is often seen cleaning the house.
The Hattifatteners Mushroom-like silent creatures, that wander around the world eternally, often in large groups, wanting to reach the horizon. They travel by boat and get attracted by lightning, when they become electric and quite dangerous.
Thingumy and Bob: Inseparable twins, with their own funny language, which a Hemulen deciphers, consisting largely of spoonerisms and similar inversions of words and syllables. Moomin eventually gets the hang of it, while Sniff thinks they are speaking a foreign language. They like to hide in small places, but to others it is not always clear what they are up to. They do not know what is theirs and steal Moominmama’s handbag to live in, which they soon return when they realise how much she needs it. The ruby they stole is, however not returned to the groke at all. They swap the ruby for another ruby with the Hobgoblin (Finn Family Moomintroll).
The Groke: A ghost-shaped creature that scares everyone, she says nothing (she growls) and the ground freezes below her. The other characters are afraid of her, but she is just simply very lonely. The Groke is also attracted to fire, but when she sees it and sits on it, the fire will extinguish.
Stinky: A small furry creature that always plays jokes on the family in the house, where he sometimes lives. He likes pinching things, is proud of his reputation as a crook, but always gets found out. He is simple and only thinks of himself.
The Muddler (Moomins): Living in a coffee tin, this anxious collector stores away all the buttons he finds, but his carelessness with the collection makes him lose and forget things. The Fuzzy is the Muddler’s wife, whom he met on an adventure with Moominpappa. Sniff is their child, but he lives with the Moomins.
Biographical interpretation.
Critics have interpreted various Moomin characters as being inspired by real people, especially members of the author's family, and Tove Jansson spoke in interviews about the backgrounds of, and possible models for, her characters.
Tove Jansson's life partner was the graphic artist Tuulikki Pietilä, whose personality inspired the character Too-Ticky in "Moominland Midwinter". Moomintroll and Little My have been seen as psychological self-portraits of the artist. The Moomins, generally speaking, relate strongly to Jansson's own family – they were bohemian, lived close to nature and were very tolerant towards diversity. Moominpappa and Moominmamma are often seen as portraits of Jansson's parents Viktor Jansson and Signe Hammarsten-Jansson. Most of Jansson's characters are on the verge of melancholy, such as the always formal Hemulen, or the strange Hattifatteners, who travel in concerted, ominous groups. Jansson uses the differences between the characters' philosophies to provide a venue for her satirical impulses.
List of books.
The books in the series, in order, are:
All of the books in the main series except "The Moomins and the Great Flood" (Originally: "Småtrollen och den stora översvämningen") were translated and published in English during the 1960s and 70s. This first book would eventually be translated into English in 2005 by David McDuff and published by Schildts of Finland for the 60th anniversary of the series. A later 2012 version of the same translation featuring Jansson's new preface to the 1991 Scandinavian printing, was published in Britain by "Sort Of Books", and was more widely distributed.
There are also five Moomin picture books by Tove Jansson:
The books and comic strips have been translated from their original Swedish and English respectively into many languages. The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My is the first Moomin book to be adapted for iPad.
The comic strip.
The Moomins also appeared in the form of comic strips; their first appearance to a big audience was in the popular London newspaper "The Evening News" in 1954, in English. Tove Jansson drew and wrote all the strips until 1959. She shared the work load with her brother Lars Jansson until 1961; after that he took over the job until 1975 when the last strip was released.
Drawn and Quarterly, a Canadian graphic novel publisher, is currently releasing a new reprint series of all "The Evening News" strips created by both Tove and Lars Jansson beginning in October 2006. The first five volumes, "Moomin: The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip" have been published, whilst the 6th volume, published in May 2011, began "Moomin: The Complete Lars Jansson Comic Strip". 
In the 1990s, a comic book version of Moomin was produced in Scandinavia after Dennis Livson and Lars Jansson's animated series was shown on television. Neither Tove nor Lars Jansson had any involvement in these comic books; however, in the wake of the series, two new Moomin comic strips were launched under the artistic and content oversight of Lars and his daughter, Sophia Jansson-Zambra. Sophia now provides sole oversight for the strips.
TV series and films.
The story of the Moomins has been made into television series on many occasions by various groups, the most recent of which is a Japanese–Dutch collaboration, that has also produced a feature-length film. However, there are also two Soviet serials, puppet animation "Mumi-troll" ("Moomintroll") and cutout animation "Shlyapa Volshebnika" ("Magician's Hat") of three parts each, and the Polish–Austrian puppet animation TV series, "The Moomins", which was broadcast and became popular in an edited form in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.
The two newest feature films re-use the footage of the Polish-Austrian series: "Moomin and Midsummer Madness" had its release in 2008, and in 2010 the Moomins appear in the first Nordic 3-D film production, with the title song by Björk, in "Moomins and the Comet Chase".
Moomin music.
The Moomin novels describe the musical activities of the Moomins, particularly those of Snufkin, his harmonica with "trills" and "twiddles". All Moomin characters sing songs, often about their thoughts and themselves. The songs often serve as core statements of the characters' personalities.
The original songs.
This music was heard outside Moominvalley after they went live on theater stage in Stockholm. Director Vivica Bandler told Jansson in 1959: "Listen, here the people want songs". The earlier version of the play was cast in Helsinki with no music.
Helsinki based pianist and composer, Erna Tauro was commissioned to write the songs to lyrics by Jansson. The first collection consisted of six Moomin Songs ("Sex muminvisor"): Moomintroll’s Song ("Mumintrollets visa"), Little My’s Song ("Lilla Mys visa"), Mrs. Fillyjonk’s Song ("Fru Filifjonks sång"), Theater Rat Emma’s Words of Wisdom ("Teaterråttan Emmas visdomsord"), Misabel’s Lament ("Misans klagolåt") and Final Song ("Slutsång").
More songs were published in the 1960s and 1970s, when Jansson and Lars Jansson produced a series of Moomin dramas for Swedish Television. The simple, yet effective melodies by Tauro were well received by the theater and TV audiences. The first songs were either sung unaccompanied or accompanied by a pianist. While the most famous Moomin songs in Scandinavia are undoubtedly "Moomintroll’s Song" and "Little My’s Song", they appear in no context in the novels.
The original songs by Jansson and Tauro remained scattered after their initial release. The first recording of the complete collection was made in 2003 by composer and arranger Mika Pohjola on the "Moomin Voices" CD ("Muminröster" in Swedish), as a tribute to the late Tove Jansson. Tauro had died in June 1993 and some of Jansson's last lyrics were composed by Pohjola in cooperation with Jansson's heirs. Pohjola was also the arranger of all songs for a vocal ensemble and chamber orchestra. All voices were sung by Åland native vocalist, Johanna Grüssner. The same recording has been released in a Finnish version in 2005, "Muumilauluja". The Finnish lyrics were translated by Kirsi Kunnas and Vexi Salmi.
The Swedish and Finnish recordings of Moomin Voices, and their respective musical scores, have been used as course material at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.
The Moomin Voices Live Band (aka. "Muumilauluja-bändi") is dedicated to exclusively performing the original lyrics and unaltered stories by Ms. Jansson. This band is led by Pohjola on piano, with vocalists Mirja Mäkelä and Eeppi Ursin.
Other musical adaptations.
Independent musical interpretations of the Moomin stories have been made for the screen versions in Poland, Great Britain and Japan. These lyrics, however, often contain simple slogans, and the music is written in a children's pop music style and with no lyrics by Jansson. These songs contrast sharply with the original Moomin novels and Jansson's pictorial, descriptive and witty lyrical rhyming, as well as Erna Tauro's Scandinavian-style songs ("visor"), which are occasionally influenced by Kurt Weill.
A Moomin opera was written in 1974 by the Finnish composer Ilkka Kuusisto, and in which Jansson designed the costumes.
Musicscapes from Moominvalley is a four-part work based on the Moomin compositions of composer and producer Heikki Mäenpää. It was created on the basis of the original Moomin works for the Tampere Art Museum.
Twenty new Moomin songs were produced in Finland by Timo Poijärvi and Ari Vainio in 2006. This Finnish album contains no original lyrics by Jansson. However, it is based on the novel, Comet in Moominland, and adheres to the original stories. The songs are performed by Samuli Edelmann, Sani, Tommi Läntinen, Susanna Haavisto and Jore Marjaranta and other established Finnish vocalists in the pop/entertainment genre. The same twenty compositions are also available as standalone multimedia CD postcards.
The Icelandic singer Björk has composed and performed the title song (Comet Song) for the film Moomins and the Comet Chase (2010). The lyrics were written by the Icelandic writer Sjón.
Hattifatteners is an art project created by Russian composer Lex Plotnikoff and photographer Tisha Razumovsky. The project consists of 31 ambient/new age music tracks and many photos of moomin characters models.
Theatre.
Several stage productions have been made from Jansson's Moomin series, including a number that Jansson herself was involved in.
The earliest production was a 1949 theatrical version of "Comet in Moominland" performed at Åbo Svenska Teater.
In the early 1950s, Jansson collaborated on Moomin-themed children's plays with Vivica Bandler. By 1958, Jansson began to become directly involved in theater as Lilla Teater produced "Troll i kulisserna" ("Troll in the wings"), a Moomin play with lyrics by Jansson and music composed by Erna Tauro. The production was a success, and later performances were held in Sweden and Norway, including recently at the Malmö Opera and Music Theatre in 2011.
Theme parks and displays.
Moomin World.
Moomin World ("Muumimaailma" in Finnish, "Muminvärlden" in Swedish) is the Moomin Theme Park especially for children. Moomin World is located on the island of Kailo beside the old town of Naantali, near the city of Turku in Western Finland.
The blueberry-coloured Moomin House is the main attraction; tourists are allowed to freely visit all five stories. It is also possible to see the Hemulen's yellow house, Moominmama's kitchen, the Fire Station, Snufkin's Camp, Moominpappa's boat, etc. Visitors may also meet Moomin characters there.
The Tampere Art Museum.
The Moominvalley of the Tampere Art Museum is a museum devoted to the original works of Tove Jansson. It contains around 2,000 works. The museum is based on the Moomin books and has many original Moomin illustrations by Tove Jansson. The gem of the collection is a blue five-storey model of the Moominhouse, which has Tove Jansson as one of its builders. As a birthday present, the 20-year-old museum received a soundscape work based on the works of Tove Jansson, called Musicscapes from Moominvalley.
Interactive playroom.
An interactive playroom about the Moomins was located at Scandinavia House, New York, from November 11, 2006, till March 31, 2007.
Success in popular culture.
The Moomin Boom.
The Moomin Boom ("muumibuumi" in Finnish) started in the 1990s, when Dennis Livson and Lars Jansson produced a 104-part animation series in Japan named "Tales From Moominvalley", which was followed by a full length movie "Comet in Moominland". Moomin books had always been steady bestsellers in Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but the animation started a new Moomin madness both in Finland and abroad, especially in Japan, where they are the official mascots of the Daiei chain of shopping centers. A large merchandising industry was built around the Moomin characters, covering everything from coffee cups and t-shirts to plastic models. Even the Finnish President Tarja Halonen has been known to wear a Moomin watch. New Moomin comic books and comic strips were published. Moomins were used to advertise Finland abroad: the Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport was decorated with Moomin images and Finnair painted big Moomin figures on its Japan-line airplanes. The peak of the Moomin Boom was the opening of the Moomin World theme park in Naantali, Finland, which has become one of Finland's international tourist destinations.
The Moomin Boom has been criticized for commercializing the Moomins. Friends of Tove Jansson and many old Moomin enthusiasts have stressed that the animations banalize the original and philosophical Moomin world to harmless family entertainment. An antithesis for the Disneyland-like Moomin World theme park is the Moomin Museum of Tampere, which exhibits the original illustrations and hand-made Moomin models by Tove Jansson.
The Jansson family has kept the rights of Moomins and controlled the Moomin Boom. The artistic control is now in the hands of Lars Jansson's daughter, Sophia Jansson-Zambra. Wanting to keep the control over Moomins, the family has turned down offers from the Walt Disney Company.
Other.
The name of the Russian rock group Mumiy Troll is a variant of the Russian name for the Moomins (Mumi Troll). Swedish progressive rock band Ritual have used the idea of Moomins in various songs, including: "Seasong for the Moominpappa", "Moomin took my Head" and, recently, a whole concept album dedicated to the furry 'trolls', "The Hemulic Voluntary Band".
The Moomins were selected as the main motif in a recent Finnish commemorative coin, the €10 Tove Jansson and Finnish Children's Culture commemorative coin, minted in 2004. The obverse depicts a combination of Tove Jansson portrait with several objects: the skyline, an artist's palette, a crescent, and a sailboat. The reverse design features three Moomin characters.

<doc id="19614243" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19614243" title="RCA Dimensia">
RCA Dimensia

Dimensia was RCA's brand name for their high-end models of television systems and their components (Tuner, VCR, CD Player, etc.) produced from 1984 to 1989, with variations continuing into the early 1990s, superseded by the ProScan model line. After RCA was acquired by General Electric in 1986, GE sold the RCA consumer electronics line to Thomson SA which continued the Dimensia line. They are significant for their wide array of advanced features and for being the first television receiver systems to feature a built in computer. In 1985 they released the Digital Command Component System, a fully integrated audio system that permitted the full functionality of Dimensia audio components without a Dimensia monitor. The name "Dimensia" actually dates back to the early 1970s when RCA used the term for an enhanced spatial stereo effect which they called "Dimensia IV". The tagline for the Dimensia was "The Next Dimension in Sight and Sound."
Features.
The RCA Dimensia systems had an wide array of high-end features that were novel for its time and are still not common anywhere.
Computer.
The main unique feature of the Dimensia system was the MRT 003, a 32-kilobyte built-in computer module which allowed the monitor to communicate with all Dimensia components and the remote functions. All components were connected via the control bus found on the I/O panel on the back of the TV. The control bus was a unique RCA connector which was colored black. All Dimensia branded components had this control jack and they all interconnected by using RCA plugs that could piggy-back, resulting in a daisy chain which simplified wiring. This was known as the SystemLink, a communication system that had 16 kilobytes of computer memory.
Input/Output.
One of the main features of the Dimensia's was the large input/output panel on the back. This included several RCA composite video terminals as well as multiple unbalanced and balanced RF antenna/cable inputs. This enabled easy connection of all Dimensia system components, each on their own channel. Additionally, the RCA cables were able to be connected piggy-back, resulting in daisy-chain wiring. The components were also connected to the control bus data link via the same piggy-back style RCA connectors. All Dimensia-Intelligent components could interact with the monitor's built-in computer. The first generation console Dimensia I/O panel shown to the left also has a SCART interface, an early multiport A/V interface which is popular in Europe(called EIA Multiport-Stero Connector by RCA).
Universal Remote.
The Dimensia system came with a very large and advanced universal remote, called "Dimensia Intelligent Audio Video" or "Dimensia Digital Control," variations of the Digital Command Center. The capabilities of this remote were far more advanced than many (perhaps any) other remotes at that time. For example, with other universal remotes you can control everything separately by controlling one component at a time; one command at a time. With the Dimensia remote, just pushing the VCR button will turn on the VCR, turn on the monitor and then play the tape in the VCR, assuming there is one in the VCR. 
The Dimensia remote was not programmable like most universal remotes today. It was only fully compatible with Dimensia components. These components were referred to as "Dimensia Intelligent," hence the name, "Dimensia Intelligent Audio Video."
Television.
Dimensia televisions had many unique features that were state of the art at the time and some that are still rare today, including:
Variations.
There are different models of the Dimensia, and there were two "generations" of the console and full Dimensia systems.
Basic/console.
This variation of the RCA Dimensia system featured just the TV mounted in a heavy wood grain veneer with a large input/output panel. It was on a swivel mount. It was not as integrated as the full Dimensia system; however, it was still high-end. In other words, the console Dimensia system was intended to be more stand-alone TV set than the full Dimensia system. The second generation console version of the Dimensia had the speakers located on the sides rather than underneath the screen. 
Audio: Since the basic Dimensia was intended to stand alone (the full system had a 100 or 200 watt amplifier and 3-way tower speakers), but was still a high-end system, it featured an unusually good built-in audio system. It was not remarkable, but it had both woofers and tweeters in the TV cabinet, whereas almost all standard television sets feature just one (mono) or two (stereo) low fidelity mid-range speaker drivers. It also had amplified external speaker connectors.
Commercial.
The commercial models featured a grounded power cord and BNC high-end commercial coaxial inputs. These models were around before the Dimensia system and were called the RCA Lyceum TV. These units were often used in educational facilities or other institutions and had the same chassis as the Colortrak 2000 and Dimensia tabletop model (the primary one). The commercial models had many extensive features such as automatic color balance and an automatic screen brightness adjuster which varied according to the ambient light in the room; at night or with the lights off it would lower its brightness.
Full Dimensia system.
Retailed at over $5,000 USD upon its release in October 1984, it came with all the matching Dimensia-intelligent components, including the VCR, CED player (canceled just before release), amplifier, equalizer, speakers, tuner, cassette recorder, CD player and turntable. This was the most remarkable system, as all the components were compatible with the TV's computer and almost any operation could be executed with just the push of a button on the Digital Command Center.
The two TV sets that were the center of this system (FKC2600E and FKC2601T) were physically identical to the Colortrak 2000 chassis. These monitors were where the systems 32 kilobyte microprocessors were located. They sat in a dedicated entertainment center that suited all the components of this fully integrated system. The system was available in two color schemes; a woodgrain veneer and a black exterior from 1984 to 1986. These monitors featured BTSC system three-channel audio which had just been adopted by the Federal Communications Commission as the U.S. standard for stereo television transmission in 1984, the same year as the release of Dimensia.
In 1985, RCA released a 40 inch projection monitor for the system with the 32 kilobyte microprocessors. This was otherwise identical to the 26 inch displays that were initially released.
Sound system.
The initial 1984 Dimensia system came with one of several three-way stereo loudspeaker systems. The first one was the SPK375 which were made to go on optional speaker stands. They were rated at 60 watts RMS and 120 watts maximum and were in a 36 pound acoustic suspension enclosure. These were initially meant to be used with the 100 watt MSA-100 amplifier; then later in 1985 the 200 watt MSA-200 amplifier was released which was compatible with the MGE-160 graphic equalizer. The impedance of the SPK-375 was six ohms and their sensitivity was 91 dB/watt/meter. The frequency response of the speakers built into the TV chassis was 50-15000 Hertz, a standard range for mid-range audio components; the external speakers and amplifiers increased this range to 35-20000 Hertz, a high fidelity range. 
The second-generation Dimensia audio components were also made for the Digital Command Component System.
Digital command component system.
In 1985, RCA released a fully integrated audio system known as the "RCA Audio System" that used the MSR-140 stereo receiver as its center for control over all the components. This allowed all Dimensia audio components to be controlled and fully functional without the need of a Dimensia television set. The price of this system started at $1,500 and included the Digital Command Center remote control. It also used the Colortrak 2000 monitor.
The SPK400 and SPK500, released in 1987, were second generation three-way speaker systems. Also released in 1987 for the second generation Dimensia system and for the Digital Command Component System were the MPA-100 and MPA-120 amplifiers; released to replace the MSA-100 and MSA-200, respectively.
In 1987, RCA released the MSP400 for the second-generation Dimensia audio system, an early Dolby Pro Logic surround sound decoder.

Cider

Cider or cyder ( ) is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from fruit juice, most commonly and traditionally apple juice, but also the juice of peaches, pears ("Perry" cider) or other fruit. Cider varies in alcohol content from 1.2% ABV to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, cider may be called "apple wine".
In the United States and some parts of Canada, "hard cider" usually refers to the alcoholic beverage discussed in this article, while "cider" may refer to non-alcoholic apple juice. When sugar or extra fruit has been added and a secondary fermentation increases the alcoholic strength, a cider is classified as "apple wine".
Cider may be made from any variety of apple, but certain cultivars grown solely for use in cider are known as cider apples. Cider is popular in the United Kingdom, especially in the West Midlands, South West England and East Anglia. The United Kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world,
including H. P. Bulmer, the largest.
, the U.K. produces 600 million litres of cider each year (130 million imperial gallons). Much cider today is made from apple pulp rather than fresh apples and may contain added sweeteners or flavours.
The beverage is also popular and traditional in some European countries such as Ireland and the French regions of Brittany ("chistr") and Normandy ("cidre"); In Spain it is especially popular in the Principality of Asturias ("sidra") although it can also be found in the Basque Country ("sagardo") and Galicia ("sidra"); Germany is another country where cider is drunk, above all in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse (Frankfurt am Main).
In Poland, which is the largest producer of apples in Europe, cider (Cydr, or Jabłecznik) is just recently gaining in popularity. However a lot of English, Swedish, Irish ciders are made from Polish apple concentrate that is considered very high quality.
Argentina is also a cider-producing and -drinking country, especially the provinces of Río Negro and Mendoza. Australia also produces cider, particularly on the island of Tasmania, which has a strong apple-growing tradition.
Pear cider is used as an alternative name for perry in the marketing of some producers' products.
Appearance and types.
The flavour of cider varies. Ciders can be classified from dry to sweet. Their appearance ranges from cloudy with sediment to completely clear, and their colour ranges from light yellow through orange to brown. The variations in clarity and colour are mostly due to filtering between pressing and fermentation. Some apple varieties will produce a clear cider without any filtration. Both sparkling and still ciders are made; the sparkling variety is the more common.
Modern, mass-produced ciders closely resemble sparkling wine in appearance. More traditional brands tend to be darker and cloudier. They are often stronger than the mass-produced varieties and taste more strongly of apples. Almost colourless "white cider" is produced on a large scale. It is typically strong (7-8% ABV) and inexpensive.
History.
The first recorded reference to cider is in Ancient Roman literature resulting from Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain in 55 BC. The Roman legions discovered the Ancient Britons fermenting crab apples. The legions brought the concept back to Rome and so to the rest of the Roman Empire. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 introduced more varieties of apple to the country and consumption increased until it was the second most popular beverage in the country, after beer.
Scratting and pressing.
Apples grown for consumption are suitable for cider making, though some regional cider-makers prefer to use a mix of eating and cider apples (as in Kent, England), or exclusively cider apples (as in the West Country, England). There are many hundreds of varieties of cultivars developed specifically for cider making.
Once the apples are gathered from trees in orchards they are "scratted" (ground down) into what is called "pomace" or "pommage". Historically this was done using pressing stones with circular troughs, or by a cider mill. Cider mills were traditionally driven by the hand, water-mill, or horse-power. In modern times they are likely to be powered by electricity. The pulp is then transferred to the cider press and built up in layers known as "cheeses" into a block.
Traditionally the method for squeezing the juice from the apples involves placing sweet straw or hair cloths between the layers of pomace. This will alternate with slatted ash-wood racks, until there is a pile of ten or twelve layers. It is important to minimize the time that the pomace is exposed to air in order to keep oxidation to a minimum.
The "set" is then subjected to increasing degrees of pressure, until all the 'must' or juice is squeezed from the pomace. This juice, after being strained in a coarse hair-sieve, is then put into either open vats or closed casks. The pressed pulp is given to farm animals as winter feed, composted, discarded or used to make liqueurs.
Fermentation.
Fermentation is carried out at a temperature of 4–16 °C (40–60 °F). This is low for most kinds of fermentation, but is beneficial for cider as it leads to slower fermentation with less loss of delicate aromas.
Shortly before the fermentation consumes all the sugar, the liquor is "racked" (siphoned) into new vats. This leaves dead yeast cells and other undesirable material at the bottom of the old vat. At this point it becomes important to exclude airborne acetic bacteria, so vats are filled completely to exclude air. The fermenting of the remaining available sugar generates a small amount of carbon dioxide that forms a protective layer, reducing air contact. This final fermentation creates a small amount of carbonation. Extra sugar may be added specifically for this purpose. Racking is sometimes repeated if the liquor remains too cloudy.
Apple-based juice may also be combined with fruit to make a fine cider; fruit purées or flavourings can be used, such as grape, cherry, raspberry and cranberry.
The cider is ready to drink after a three-month fermentation period, though more often it is matured in the vats for up to three years.
Blending and bottling.
For larger-scale cider production, ciders from vats produced from different varieties of apple may be blended to accord with market taste. If the cider is to be bottled, usually some extra sugar is added for sparkle. Higher quality ciders can be made using the champagne method, but this is expensive in time and money and requires special corks, bottles, and other equipment. Some home brewers use beer bottles, which work perfectly well, and are inexpensive. This allows the cider to become naturally carbonated.
Festivals.
The western British tradition of wassailing the apple trees and making an offering of cider and bread in Autumn to protect the fertility of the orchard appears to be a relatively ancient tradition, superficially dating back to the pre-Christian Early Medieval period. The Hallowe'en tradition of 'bobbing' for apples is due to the abundance of fruit at this time.
A modern cider festival is an organized event that promotes cider and (usually) perry. A variety of ciders and perries will be available for tasting and buying. Such festivals may be organized by pubs, cider producers, or cider-promoting private organizations.
Long Island, NY a region well known for its award-winning wine production has made its first hard cider(s). True Companion and True Believer are the two hard ciders to come from LI winery, Peconic Bay. The recent rise in the popularity of hard cider has guided event producer, Starfish Junction, to host Long Island's first hard cider festival, Pour the Core.
Uses.
Calvados and applejack are distilled from cider. Calvados is made throughout Normandy, France, not just in the Calvados département. It is made from cider by double distillation. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28–30% alcohol. In a second pass, the amount of alcohol is augmented to about 40%.
Applejack is a strong alcoholic beverage made in North America by concentrating cider, either by the traditional method of freeze distillation, or by true evaporative distillation. In traditional freeze distillation, a barrel of cider is left outside during the winter. When the temperature is low enough, the water in the cider starts to freeze. If the ice is removed, the (now more concentrated) alcoholic solution is left behind in the barrel. If the process is repeated often enough, and the temperature is low enough, the alcohol concentration is raised to 30–40% alcohol by volume. In freeze distillation, methanol and fusel oil, which are natural fermentation byproducts, may reach harmful concentrations. These toxins can be separated when regular heat distillation is performed. Home production of applejack is illegal in most countries.
A few producers in Quebec and England, inspired by ice wine, have developed ice cider (French: "cidre de glace"). For this product, the apples are frozen either before or after being harvested. Its alcohol concentration is 9–13% ABV.
A popular apéritif in Normandy is "pommeau", a drink produced by blending unfermented apple juice and apple brandy in the barrel (the high alcoholic content of the spirit stops the fermentation process of the cider and the blend takes on the character of the aged barrel).
Cocktails may include cider. Besides kir and snakebite, an example is Black Velvet in a version of which cider may replace champagne.
Cider may also be used to make vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is noted for its high acidity and flavour.
Related drinks.
Other fruits can be used to make cider-like drinks. The most popular is perry, known in France as "poiré", produced mostly in Lower Normandy, and is made from fermented pear juice. A branded sweet perry known as Babycham, marketed principally as a women's drink and sold in miniature Champagne-style bottles, was once popular but has become unfashionable. Another related drink is cyser – cider fermented with honey.
Although not widely made in modern times, various other pome fruits can produce palatable drinks. Apicius, in Book II of "De re coquinaria", includes a recipe calling for quince cider.
National variations.
Before the development of rapid long distance transportation, regions of cider consumption generally coincided with regions of cider production: that is, areas with apple orchards. For example, R. A. Fletcher notes that in the "Liber Sancti Jacobi", cider was said to be more common than wine in 12th century Galicia.
Argentina.
In Argentina, cider, or "sidra" is by far the most popular alcoholic carbonated drink during the Christmas and New Year holidays. It has traditionally been considered the choice of the middle and lower classes (along with "ananá fizz "and pineapple juice), whereas the higher classes would rather go for champagne or local sparkling wines for their Christmas or New Year toast. Popular commercial brands of cider are "Real", "La Victoria", "Del Valle", "La Farruca" and "Rama Caída". It is usually marketed in 0.72 litre glass or plastic bottles. However, there has been lately a campaign by some bottlers to make cider a drink consumed all year round, in any occasion, and not only seasonally. Cider now comes in smaller bottle sizes and commercials show people drinking at any time (and not only toasting with it around a traditional Christmas or New Year table).
Australia.
The composition of cider is defined in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and "means the fruit wine prepared from the juice or must of apples and no more than 25% of the juice or must of pears".
Cider has been made in Australia since its early settlement. Primarily this production has been for limited local usage, with national commercial distribution and sales dominated by two brands: Mercury Cider and Strongbow. Since early 2005 they been joined in the market by numerous new producers including Three Oaks Cider, Pipsqueak and Tooheys 5 Seeds Cider as well as imported brands like Magners, Weston's, Monteith's, Kopparberg, Rekorderlig and Somersby.
With the growth in interest in cider, the number of local producers has increased. Some cider producers are attempting to use more traditional methods and traditional cider apple varieties. The Southern Highlands of New South Wales are experiencing such a traditionalist revival with brands such as Sunshack Cider made from only local produce. Tasmania, also known as the 'Apple Isle' is having a resurgence of cider making. Spreyton Cider Co is a family owned cider producer in the Mersey Valley region, just south of Devonport. They make a range of hand crafted, premium ciders made from apples grown on orchards owned for 4 generations. Capt.Blighs 'Tasmanian Cider' is one of the newest producers using cider apples from the Huon Valley and Channel area. Huon Cider, made in New Norfolk, Tasmania, from Sturmer Pippin apples, a variety of apple commonly grown in the region since the 1830s. Henry of Harcourt and Bress cider (both from Harcourt, Victoria) are two of the most complex and interesting ciders that are commercially available. Other smaller brands rely on the available culinary (standard eating - supermarket and cooking apples) fruit. From Victoria's Yarra Valley come Coldstream cider, Kelly Brothers cider and Napoleone & Co. The Bridge Road Brewery and Amulet Winery, both in Victoria's Beechworth, have released ciders. South Australia's boutique ciders include Lobo (Adelaide Hills), The Hills Cider (Adelaide Hills), Thorogoods (Burra) and Aussie Cider (Barossa). In Western Australia the number of cider producers has also grown in the southwest region, particularly in areas where wine is also produced with producers in Denmark, Pemberton and Margaret River.
The cider market has grown from late 2008 onwards due to the trend in the UK following the Magners "drink with ice campaign" and to a lesser degree the change in the laws relating to Alcohol Tax on RTDs. Cider had the largest percentage growth in sales of alcohol products in 2009 & 2010.
Austria.
In Austria cider is made in the south west of Lower Austria, the so-called "Mostviertel" and in Upper Austria as well as in parts of Styria. Almost every farmer there has some apple or pear trees. Many of the farmers also have a kind of inn called "Mostheuriger". There they serve cider and also something to eat. Cider is typically called "Most".
Belgium.
Scottish & Newcastle own Belgium cider maker Stassen SA, who in addition to their own local brands such as Strassen X Cider also produce Strongbow Jacques, a 5.5% ABV cider with cherry, raspberry and blackcurrant flavours. Zonhoven based Konings NV specialises in private label ciders for European retailers and offers a wide variety of flavours and packaging options to the beverage industry. "Stella Artois Cidre" is produced in Zonhoven and has been marketed since 2011.
Canada.
Quebec cider is considered a traditional alcoholic beverage. It is generally sold in 750 ml bottles, has an alcohol content generally between 7% and 13% (with aperitifs ciders having alcohol content up to 20%), and can be served as a substitute for wine. As in the rest of the world, sparkling cider is getting more and more popular in Quebec and thanks to the law cider sold in the province can only be made from 100% pure apple juice. Cider making was, however, forbidden from the early years of the British rule as it was in direct conflict with established British brewers' interests (most notably John Molson). In recent years, a new type called ice cider has emerged on the market. This type of cider is made from apples with a particularly high level of sugar caused by natural frost.
Cider is commercially produced in British Columbia (large and small producers), Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario, usually with a 5-7% alcohol content. It is sold in 341ml glass bottles and two litre plastic bottles, and does not usually have added sugar.
Channel Islands.
Along with Normandy, the Channel Islands had a strong cider-making tradition. Cider had been the ordinary drink of people of Jersey from the 16th century, when the commercial opportunities offered by cider exports spurred the transformation of feudal open-field agriculture to enclosure. Until the 19th century, it was the largest agricultural export with up to a quarter of the agricultural land given over to orchards. In 1839, for example, of cider were exported from Jersey to England alone,
and almost were exported from Guernsey 1834–1843,
but by 1870 exports from Jersey had slumped to .
Beer had replaced cider as a fashionable drink in the main export markets, and even the home markets had switched to beer as the population became more urban. Potatoes overtook cider as the most important crop in Jersey in the 1840s, and in Guernsey glasshouse tomato production grew in importance. Small-scale cider production on farms for domestic consumption, particularly by seasonal workers from Brittany and mainland Normandy, was maintained, but by the mid-20th century production dwindled until only 8 farms were producing cider for their own consumption in 1983.
The number of orchards had been reduced to such a level that the destruction of trees in the Storm of 1987 demonstrated how close the Islands had come to losing many of its traditional cider apple varieties. A concerted effort was made to identify and preserve surviving varieties and new orchards were planted. As part of diversification, farmers have moved into commercial cider production, and the cider tradition is celebrated and marketed as a heritage experience. In Jersey, a strong (above 7%) variety is currently sold in shops and a "bouché" style is also marketed.
In Guernsey the only commercial producer of cider is The Rocquette Cider Co. which produces a wide range of ciders and is beginning to compete on an international stage.
In Jersey, cider is used in the preparation of "black butter" (Jèrriais: "nièr beurre"), a traditional preserve.
Chile.
Cider has been made in Chile since colonial times. Southern Chile accounts for nearly all Cider production in the country. Chileans make a distinction between ""sidra"" ("cider"), in fact sparkling cider, and ""chicha de manzana"" ("apple chicha"), a homemade cider that is considered of less quality.
Denmark.
Despite a strong apple tradition, Denmark has little cider production. Six places that produce cider in Denmark are Pomona (since 2003), Fejø Cider (since 2003), Dancider (since 2004), Ørbæk Bryggeri (since 2006), Ciderprojektet (since 2008) and Svaneke Bryghus (since 2009). All are inspired mainly by English and French cider styles. The assortment of imported ciders has grown significantly since 2000, prior to that only ciders from Sweden, primarily non-alcoholic, were generally available. The leading cider on the Danish market is made by CULT A/S. In 2008, Carlsberg launched an alcoholic cider in Denmark called Somersby Cider which has an alcohol content of 4.7%, and a sweet taste.
East Asia.
Cider in Japan and Korea refers to a soft drink similar to Sprite or lemonade. A popular drink in China is called "Apple Vinegar", which is actually cider. Shanxi Province is noted for the "vinegar" produced there.
Finland.
The best-known brands are "Golden Cap", "Fizz" and "Upcider". They typically contain 4.5-4.7%vol of alcohol. Virtually all Finnish cider is produced from fermented apple (or pear) juice concentrate and comes in a variety of flavours ranging from forest berries to rhubarb and vanilla.
France.
French "cidre" () is an alcoholic drink produced predominantly in Normandy and Brittany. It varies in strength from below 4% alcohol to considerably more. Cidre Doux is a sweet cider, usually up to 3% in strength. 'Demi-Sec' is 3–5% and Cidre Brut is a strong dry cider of 4.5% alcohol and above. Most French ciders are sparkling. Higher quality cider is sold in champagne-style bottles ("cidre bouché"). Many ciders are sold in corked bottles, but some screw-top bottles exist.
In crêperies (crêpe restaurants) in Brittany, cider is generally served in traditional ceramic bowls (or wide cups) rather than glasses. A "kir Breton" (or "kir normand") is a cocktail apéritif made with cider and cassis, rather than white wine and cassis for the traditional "kir". The Domfrontais, in the Orne (Basse-Normandie), is famous for its pear cider (poiré). The "calvados du Domfrontais" is made of cider and poiré.
Some cider is also made in south western France, in the French part of the Basque Country. It is a traditional drink there and is making a recovery. Ciders produced here are generally of the style seen in the Spanish part of the Basque Country.
Calvados, from Normandy, and Lambig from Brittany are a spirits made of cider through a process called double distillation. In the first pass, the result is a liquid containing 28%–30% alcohol. In a second pass, the amount of alcohol is augmented to about 40%.
Germany.
German cider, usually called "Apfelwein" (apple wine), and regionally known as "Ebbelwoi", "Apfelmost" (apple must), "Viez" (from Latin "vice", the second or substitute wine), or "Saurer Most" (sour must), has an alcohol content of 5.5%–7% and a tart, sour taste.
German cider is mainly produced and consumed in Hessen, particularly in the Frankfurt, Wetterau and Odenwald areas, in Moselfranken, Merzig (Saarland) and the Trier area, as well as the lower Saar area and the region bordering on Luxembourg and in the area along the Neckar River in Swabia. In these regions, several large producers, as well as numerous small, private producers, often use traditional recipes. An official "Viez" route or cider route connects Saarburg with the border to Luxembourg.
Ireland.
Cider is a popular drink in Ireland; for a long time cider production was officially encouraged and supported by a preferential tax treatment. A single cider, Bulmers, dominates sales in Ireland: Owned by C&C and produced in Clonmel, County Tipperary, this Bulmers has a connected history to the British Bulmers cider brand up until 1949. Outside the Republic of Ireland, C&C brand their cider as Magners. It is very popular in Ireland to drink cider over ice and encouraged in their advertising. Cidona, essentially a non-alcoholic version of Bulmers, is a popular soft drink in Ireland, and used to be a C&C-owned brand.
Italy.
Cider was once widely produced in Northern Italy's apple growing regions, with a marked decline during fascist rule, due to the introduction of a law banning the industrial production of alcoholic beverages derived from fruits of less than 7% ABV, which was aimed at protecting wine producers.
Present laws and regulations are favourable to cider makers, but production has only survived in a few alpine locations, mostly in the regions of Trentino, and in Piedmont, where it is known as "vin ëd pom" (apple wine) or "pomada", because it traditionally was left to ferment in a vat along with grape pomace, giving it a distinctive reddish colour.
Luxembourg.
In Luxembourg, "viez" (pronounced feetz) is rather like English scrumpy. It is cloudy and varies from non-alcoholic to very alcoholic.
Mexico.
Two types of cider ("sidra") are sold in Mexico. One type is a popular apple-flavoured, carbonated soft drink, sold under a number of soft drink brands, such as Sidral Mundet and Manzana Lift (both Coca-Cola FEMSA brands) and Sidral Aga from Group AGA. The other type, alcoholic "sidra", is a sparkling cider typically sold in Champagne-style bottles with an alcohol content comparable to beer. "Sidra" was, due to the expense of imported Champagne, sometimes used as a substitute for New Year's Eve toasts in Mexico, as it is also a sweet, fruity drink. However, now the practice is to drink cider on Christmas Eve, celebrated with the family, and Champagne on New Year's, celebrated with friends. Cider beverages form a very small share of the Mexican alcoholic beverage market, with the figures for 2009 volume sales amounting to only 3.8 million litres.
Netherlands.
In The Netherlands cider is not as commonly available as in its surrounding countries. In 2007 Heineken started testing a cider-based drink branded Jillz in a number of bars throughout the country. The beverage, an alcopop made by blending sparkling water, fruit flavoring, malt and cider, is marketed towards female drinkers as an alternative to beer. At the same time, Heineken also introduced Strongbow Gold as a secondary brand to provide the choice of a real cider, which was targeted to a male audience. Both beverages contain 5% alcohol by volume, which is similar to a typical draught beer in the Netherlands. Other brands are available in supermarkets, most noticeably Magners and Savanna Dry, and in liquor stores generally a broader range may be obtained.
New Zealand.
In New Zealand, there are many companies which produce and/or distribute cider. Lion produces Isaac's ciders under the Mac's trademark. The range includes three flavours: apple, pear and berry with limited edition ciders that are released seasonally. Their Speight's brand also makes a cider.
The Dominion Breweries brands Monteith's Brewery in Greymouth on the west coast of the South Island makes an apple and a pear cider while their Old Mout Cider, based in Nelson on the South Island, is blending fruit wines with cider to create fruit ciders including boysenberry and feijoa varieties. Rekorderlig Cider (Pear, Wild Berries, Mango and Raspberry, Strawberry and Lime, Apple and Blackcurrant and Apple and spice), and Johnny Arrow Cider are another two brands owned by this company.
There are also a number of boutique cider houses, including McCashins Brewery in Stoke on the South Island specialising in dry style ciders from freshly crushed fruit.
Ciders in New Zealand are regulated in their minimum content of fruit juice and alcohol content (mostly 4 to 5%).
Norway.
In Norway, cider (sider) is a naturally fermented apple juice. Pear juice is sometimes mixed with the apple to get a better fermenting process started. The main area for cider production is in the proclaimed "fruit garden" or "apple orchard" of Norway, the Hardanger region.
Following lengthy navigation through the directives of Norway's complex alcohol laws, three brands of sparkling cider with an abv of approximately 10% are available to the Norwegian public through distribution by the monopoly outlet Vinmonopolet, "Hardanger Sider Sprudlande" from Hardanger, "Krunesider" from Bergen sourcing apples from Hardanger, and "Liersider" from Lier. In line with the law of 1975 prohibiting all advertising of alcoholic beverages of abv greater than 2.5%, the products receive little exposure despite some favourable press reaction.
Ciders of low alcohol levels are widely available, mostly brands imported from Sweden, although carbonated soft drinks with no alcoholic content may also be marketed as "cider".
Pakistan.
Non-alcoholic, apple-flavoured carbonated drinks are popular in the country, with local brands suchs as Mehran Bottler's Apple Sidra and Murree Brewery's Bigg Apple in the market.
Portugal.
As in Italy, cider was once very popular in Northern Portugal where its production was larger than wine production until the eleventh century, but nowadays its popularity has decreased and it is only consumed in the coasts of Minho, Âncora e Lima, where it's used as a refreshment for thirst. In some festivities it is still used rather than wine.
Poland.
Poland is the largest producer of apples in Europe. Cider is known in Poland as Cydr or Jabłecznik. The category is however just gaining popularity among the consumers. Areas strong in Cider production are focused around the center of the country in Mazowieckie, Łódzkie voivoideships.
Large quantities of Polish apple concentrate are exported to UK, Scandinavia and Ireland for cider production.
Brands important to note are: Cydr 7 Sadów, Joker Forest Fruit Cider, App Cider, INN Cider, Cydr Warka,Cydr Lubelski.
Most of these brands can be found in major supermarket chains, like Tesco, Alma, Auchan and Intermarche.
South Africa.
There are two main brands of cider produced in South Africa, Hunters and Savanna Dry. They are produced and distributed through Distell Group Limited. Hunters Gold was first introduced in South Africa in 1988 as an alternative to beer. The Hunters range includes Hunters Dry, Hunters Gold and Hunters Export. Savanna Dry was introduced in 1996 and also comes in a Light Premium variety.
Craft cideries in South Africa are on the increase, namely Windermere real apple cider and Everson's cider both from the Elgin valley. Windermere cider is the oldest cidery in South Africa and produces real apple cider from whole Windermere farm apples. Both are traditional cideries with the cider being oak aged.
Spain.
The making and drinking of cider is traditional in several areas of northern Spain, mainly the Principality of Asturias and the Basque Country.
The largest producer of cider in Spain is the Atlantic region of Asturias, where cider is considered not only a beverage but an intrinsic part of its culture and folklore. Asturias amounts more than 80% of the whole production of Spain. The consumption of cider in Asturias is of 54 litres per person/year, probably the highest in any European region.
One of the most popular ciders in Spain is called "El Gaitero" (the bagpipe player) which can be found everywhere in Spain and which is produced in this region. However, it must not be confused with the traditional Asturian cider as it is a sparkling cider more in the way of French ciders. It is a factory produced cider, sweet and very foamy, much like lambrusco, different from the more artisan and traditional cider productions. Recently, new apple tree plantations have been started in grounds belonging to the old coal mines, once important in Asturias.
The first testimony about cider in Asturies was made by Greek geographer Strabo in 60 BC.
The traditional Asturian "sidra" is a still cider of 4–8% strength, although there are other varieties. Traditionally, it is served in "sidrerías" and "chigres", pubs specializing in cider where it is also possible to have other drinks as well as traditional food. One of the most outstanding characteristics is that it is poured in very small quantities from a height into a wide glass, with the arm holding the bottle extended upwards and the one holding the glass extended downwards. This technique is called "escanciar un culín" (also "echar un culín") and is done to get air bubbles into the drink ("espalmar"), thus giving it a sparkling taste like Champagne that lasts a very short time.
Cider is also poured from barrels in the traditional Espichas.
Cider has also been popular in the Basque Country for centuries. Whilst Txacoli and Rioja wines became more popular in Vizcaya, Alava and Navarra during the 19th century, there is still a strong cider culture in Gipuzkoa. From the 1980s, government and gastronomic associations have worked to revive this culture in all Basque regions. Known as "sagardoa" (IPA: /s̺a'gaɾdoa/), it is drunk either bottled or in a cider house (called a "sagardotegi"), where it is poured from barrels. Most of "sagardotegis" are in the north of Gipuzkoa (Astigarraga, Hernani, Urnieta and Usurbil), but they can be found everywhere in Guipuzcoa, the north-west of Navarre and the Northern Basque Country.
Cider tasting events are popular in the Basque province of Gipuzkoa, where stalls are set up on the street selling the drink from several producers at cheap prices and served until stock runs out.
Sweden.
Due to Swedish law, stores in Sweden cannot sell cider with less than 15 percentage juice by volume under the name Cider. "Cider" with none or less than 15% juice is instead usually sold as ""Apple/Pear beverage of cider character"" (Swedish: ""Äpple-/Pärondryck med Ciderkaraktär""). Brands of cider in Sweden include Rekorderlig, Kivik, Herrljunga Cider and Kopparberg cider. Most Swedish cider has little in common with traditional cider from other countries. Buyers beware of the difference between actual cider, and the cheaper imitation, which is very sweet and often berry or fruit flavoured, making it more like an alcoholic fruit soda.
United Kingdom.
In the UK, cider is mostly associated with the West Country, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, but is also produced in Wales and across England, particularly Kent, Suffolk, Norfolk and more recently Buckinghamshire. Cheshire is also home to two cider brewing farms. Cider is available in sweet, medium and dry varieties. Recent years have seen a significant increase in cider sales in the UK. The National Association of Cider Makers (NACM) estimates a minimum of 480 active cider makers in the UK. As of 2008, UK cider production comprises 61.9% of cider produced in the EU, and a 7.9% share of UK alcohol servings.
Overview.
There are two broad main traditions in cider production in the UK - the West Country tradition and the eastern Kent and East Anglia tradition. The former are made using a much higher percentage of true cider apples and so are richer in tannins and sharper in flavour. Kent and East Anglia ciders tend to use a higher percentage of, or are exclusively made from, culinary and dessert fruit; Kentish ciders such as Biddenden's, Rough Old Wife and Theobolds are typical of this style. They tend to be clearer, more vinous and lighter in body and flavour.
At one end of the scale are the traditional, small farm-produced varieties. These are non-carbonated and usually cloudy orange in appearance. Britain's West Country contains many of these farms which have an abundance of ancient varieties of specialist cider-apples. Production is often on such a small scale, the product being sold only at the site of manufacture or in local pubs and shops.
At the other end of the scale are the factories mass-producing brands such as Strongbow and Blackthorn.
Mass-produced cider, such as that produced by Bulmers, is likely to be pasteurised and force-carbonated. The colour is likely to be golden yellow with a clear appearance from the filtration. "White ciders" are almost colourless in appearance.
Commercial.
A key market segment exists in the UK for strong white mass-produced cider at 7.5% alcohol by volume. Cider with higher than 7.5% alcohol has a higher rate of excise duty. Typical brands include White Lightning, Diamond White, Frosty Jack, and White Strike.
By volume of alcohol, the excise duty on cider is lower than any other drink. The duty, as of 2011, was £35.87 per 100 litres of cider of up to 7.5% alcohol. 100 litres of table wine or alcopops would attract £241.23 of duty, wine under 5.5% was charged £102.21, £139.28 for 100 litres of 7.5% beer, and £191.40 for the equivalent alcohol volume of spirits.
Before 1996, brands could be labelled at up to 8.4% alcohol when they actually contained 7.4%. This happened because the duty was levied on the actual strength of the alcohol, but Trade Descriptions legislation allowed the label to overstate the alcohol content by up to 1%.
White Lightning was then sold in both 7.4% and 8.4% strengths, due to uncertainty about whether consumers would prefer the pricier, stronger drink, or the slightly weaker, cheap one.
Until 2005, the market leading White Lightning brand was being sold on an almost continual 50% extra free promotion, giving 3 litres of 7.5% cider for a typical selling price of £2.99. Scottish Courage, which owned the brand, decided that year to restrict bottle size to 2 litres as part of its responsible drinking strategy. A spokesman for the company spoke of white cider in general, "It is the cheapest way to buy alcohol in the UK. This is pocket money these days. There is no other alcohol category that has the same challenge as white cider. One three litre plastic bottle of white cider contains almost the full recommended weekly alcohol intake for a male drinker" (225 ml, 22.5 units, of pure alcohol content compared with the recommended maximum of 28 units).
This led to a 70% drop in sales of White Lightning,
but increased sales of the brand owner's weaker, more profitable brands. Other manufacturers followed by increasing prices and scrapping their 3 litre bottles.
The price increases on 7.5% cider has increased sales of 5% mass-market cider, which is still widely available in 3 litre bottles in supermarkets.
Since September 2010, HM Revenue and Customs has decreed that to be called cider a drink must contain at least 35% apple or pear juice and must have a pre-fermentation gravity of at least 1033 degrees. The legislation was introduced to stop cheap high alcohol content drinks being called cider, thus taking advantage of the lower duty rates applied to cider.
West of England.
Cloudy, unfiltered ciders made in the West Country are often called "scrumpy", from "scrump", a local dialect term for a small or withered apple. Ciders from Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire made from traditional recipes have a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) awarded by the European Union. There are over 25 cider producers in Somerset alone, many of them small family businesses. Historically, farm labourers in Devon, Wiltshire, Dorset, Cornwall and Somerset would receive part of their pay in the form of a substantial daily allowance of cider and local traditions such as the Wassail recall the earlier significance of cider-apple.
Large producers in the West of England include Thatchers Cider in Sandford, Somerset, Bulmers (the producer of Strongbow) in Hereford, as well as Brothers Cider and Gaymer Cider Company, both of which are based in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. There is also Weston's Cider in Much Marcle, Herefordshire. Additionally Hogans Cider in Alcester, Warwickshire produces cider from apples and pears From Gloucestershire, Herefordshire & Worcestershire. Healey's Cornish Cyder Farm is renowned for its Rattlers branded cider, produced in Truro, Cornwall.
During the 17th and 18th centuries, a condition known as Devon colic, a form of lead poisoning, was associated with the consumption of cider, vanishing after a campaign to remove lead components from cider presses in the early 19th century. The lead poisoning was also prevalent in Herefordshire as lead salts were added to the cider as a sweetener, being much cheaper than sugar.
Central Southern England.
In recent years there has been an increase in the number of smaller cider producers, many of which are making traditional ciders in areas which have not previously been recognised as cider producing areas. Buckinghamshire for example has seen three producers of real cider emerge in the past five years, two of these (Virtual Orchard and Woughton Orchard) being based in the new city of Milton Keynes. The Radnage Cider Company is based further south in the county. Virtual Orchard was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal Champion Cider of Britain in 2011 by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA).
Wales.
Cider is called "seidr" in Welsh.
Smallhold production of cider made on farms as a beverage for labourers died out in Wales during the 20th century. Cider and perry production in Wales began a dramatic revival in the early 2000s, with many small firms entering production throughout the country. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has actively encouraged this trend, and Welsh ciders and perries have won many awards at CAMRA festivals; meanwhile, the establishment of groups such as UKCider and the Welsh Perry & Cider Society have spurred communication among producers.
Welsh varieties of apples and pears are often distinct from those grown in England, giving cider from Wales a flavour noticeably different from ciders from nearby regions.
Scotland.
Cider is made in Scotland mainly by small producers, such as Thistly Cross and Waulkmill Cider. The apples are sourced in Scotland and the resultant brews are mainly sold near to the place of origin. Thistly Cross produce many fruit flavoured ciders which are now being sold in Scottish Waitrose and Peckham's stores. Waulkmill Cider is made only with apples collected from within Dumfries and Galloway, and is mainly sold at farmers markets and festivals.
Definition of "real" cider.
The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) defines "real" cider as a product containing at least 90% fresh apple juice, with no added flavourings or colourings. Their definition prohibits the use of apple and pear concentrates, and prohibits substantial chaptalisation of the juice (adding sugar prior to fermentation) except in years when the level of natural sugar in the fruit is low. They allow the addition of sweetener for taste after fermentation, and allow limited dilution after fermentation. CAMRA states that the practice of adding a substantial amount of sugar at the fermentation stage to produce a high-alcohol (12–14% abv) beverage that is then diluted with water down to 8.5% abv or less does not conform to their definition of real cider.
More leniently, UK law defines cider as containing at least 35% apple or pear juice, which may be from concentrate.
United States.
During colonial times apple cider was consumed as the main beverage with meals because water was often considered unsafe for drinking. Ciderkin, a slightly alcoholic beverage made from cider pomace, could also be found on colonial tables. Sometime after Prohibition the word "cider" came to mean unfiltered, unfermented apple juice. In current U.S. usage the term is used for both fresh-pressed juice and fermented products, although the latter are often called "hard cider." "Apple juice," meanwhile, refers to a clear, filtered, pasteurized apple product.
For instance, in Pennsylvania, apple cider is legally defined as an "amber golden, opaque, unfermented, entirely nonalcoholic juice squeezed from apples". Imitation "cider" products may contain natural or artificial flavours or colours generally recognized as safe, provided their presence is declared on the label by the use of the word "imitation" in type at least one-half the size of the type used to declare the flavour. Cider containing more than 0.15 percent alcohol by volume is classified as hard cider.
Cider may also refer to sparkling apple juice, which is often filtered, such as Martinelli's sparkling apple cider, once touted specifically as "non-alcoholic cider". Martinelli's is sold as "cider" or "juice" depending on regional usage.
Alcoholic cider is produced throughout the United States, especially in New England, Michigan, upstate New York and the West Coast with some new producers in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Some U.S. products which describe themselves as "hard cider" are made by adding flavourless spirit alcohol to unfermented apple juice pressed from juice apples rather than cider apples.
Due to tax legislation in the US, a cider becomes classified as a fruit wine when sugar or extra fruit is added and a secondary fermentation increases the strength.

Chang Gun

Chang Gun (常袞) (729–783), formally the Duke of He'nei (河內公), was an official of the Chinese dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Daizong and Emperor Dezong.
Background.
Chang Gun was born in 729, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Jingzhao Municipality (京兆), which encompassed the Tang capital Chang'an. His great-grandfather Chang Xu (常緒), grandfather Chang Yi (常毅), and father Chang Wuwei (常無為) all served as minor officials. He had at least one older brother, Chang Jie (常皆).
Chang Gun himself passed the imperial examinations late in Emperor Xuanzong's "Tianbao" era (742-756). He initially served as a scribe for Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince Li Heng (the later Emperor Suzong), and later served as an imperial chronicler.
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
In 764, during the reign of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, Chang Gun was made an imperial scholar and a reserve official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, "Libu"), and also put in charge of drafting imperial edicts. In 765, he was made "Zhongshu Sheren" (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng"). Chang was said to be a capable writer, and both he and his colleague as "Zhongshu Sheng", Yang Yan, were respected at the time and often discussed about together.
Chang was said to be honest and not associating with powerful individuals at court. At the time, the eunuch Yu Chao'en was extremely powerful, and at Yu's request, Emperor Daizong made Yu the acting principal of the imperial university, a move that Chang protested based on Yu's status as a eunuch notwithstanding Yu's power. He also advocated a curbing in the behavior of Huige soldiers who had been treated as guests in the Tang realm. (Huige armies had greatly assisted Tang in defeating the rebel state of Yan during the Anshi Rebellion.) He further advocated that Emperor Daizong should decline elaborate birthday gifts that the regional governors were presenting to him or to Buddhist or Taoist temples in his honor, pointing out that these governors should have otherwise had no wealths of their own, and therefore these gifts must have come from pilfering from the people. Emperor Daizong was thankful for Chang's suggestions, but there was no indication on whether he accepted them. In 766, he was made the deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, "Libu Shilang") and continued to be an imperial scholar. At that time, the eunuch Liu Zhongyi (劉忠翼) and the military governor Ma Lin (馬璘) were both trusted by Emperor Daizong and therefore were powerful. Both tried to intercede on their relatives' behalf so that the relatives could become imperial university students, but Chang rejected the intercessions.
In 777, Emperor Daizong, tired of corruption by long-time chancellors Yuan Zai and Wang Jin, executed Yuan and exiled Wang after having five officials, including Chang, Liu Yan, and Li Han (李涵), interrogate them. Emperor Daizong replaced Yuan and Wang with Chang and Yang Wan — in Chang's case, he was made "Menxia Shilang" (門下侍郎, the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省, "Menxia Sheng")) and given the "de facto" chancellor designation of "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事). It was said that Chang paid attention to details and particularly wanted to stamp out any trace of corruption, while Yang had a more thorough view of the entire picture. It was also said that he was often guided by his own likes and dislikes. For example, as the officials' salaries were low at the time, he proposed an increase — but both he and Han Huang, who was in control of economic matters at the time, decided the scales by their own dislikes, and particularly set low salaries for two officials they disliked, Zhang Can (張參) and Zhao Ji (趙惎). Emperor Daizong trusted Yang more and gave him more responsibility, and Chang resented this. Yang died later in 777, however, and Chang effectively became the only chancellor in control of the government. (Jealous of Yang, he encouraged the official Su Duan (蘇端) to propose a degradation of Yang's proposed posthumous name, a proposal that Emperor Daizong angrily rejected and exiled Su for.)
Solely in control of government, Chang set out to reform it in his vision. One of his first steps was to decline meals sent to the chancellors from the imperial kitchen, which had become customary during Yuan's and Wang's term as chancellor and which were enough for 10 people — an act that, however, drew parodies from other officials of the time that the meals were intended to reward the chancellors for their accomplishments, and that if he did not have accomplishments, he should decline the position, not the meal. The office of the chancellors (政事堂, "Zhengshi Tang") was then within the legislative bureau, and customarily, the chancellors often went through a backdoor of the office of chancellors to visit the "Zhongshu Sheren", who resided at the legislative bureau. Chang believed this showed partiality, and had the door sealed. During Yuan's term of office, much bribery was involved in the promotion of officers. Chang, in response, ordered that all promotions be strictly reviewed and particularly required literary talent for promotions. It was said that while Chang's reforms ended the era of bribery-influenced promotions, it also caused government work to grind to a halt.
Meanwhile, as there was no "Zhongshu Ling" (中書令, head of the legislative bureau) or "Zhongshu Shilang" (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau), the senior "Zhongshu Sheren" Cui Youfu effectively ran the legislative bureau. Chang, pointing out that his responsibility as chancellor included responsibility to oversee the legislative bureau as well, took over the responsibilities from Cui and removed Cui's desk, drawing Cui's resentment. Chang tried to defuse it by putting Cui in charge of selecting officials at the ministry of civil service affairs, but they often ran into disputes as to which officials to select. In 778, there was an incident when the general Zhu Ci submitted what he thought to be a sign of fortune — a mouse living peacefully with a mother cat and her kittens. Chang considered this a sign of fortune and congratulated Emperor Daizong, but Cui, argued that this was against the cat's nature and was a sign that officials were not carrying out their responsibilities. Meanwhile, although Chang's position was important, he did not have an honorific title nor had he been given a creation, and so, at the urging of the general Guo Ziyi, Emperor Daizong created Chang the Duke of He'nei and gave him the honorific title "Yinqing Guanglu Daifu" (銀青光祿大夫).
During Emperor Dezong's reign.
Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. During Emperor Daizong's mourning period, Chang Gun and Cui Youfu got into a serious conflict over how many days the officials should wear mourning clothes. Chang advocated that because, by custom, Emperor Dezong was to wear mourning clothes for 27 days, so should the officials. Cui advocated that, because Emperor Daizong's will specified three days, the officials should wear the mourning clothes for three days. Chang got sufficiently angry over the argument that he submitted an accusation against Cui, stating that Cui had frivolously changed the proper regulation of the rites and requesting that Cui be demoted to be the prefect of Chao Prefecture (潮州, in modern Chaozhou, Guangdong). Emperor Dezong, believing the demotion to be too severe, only ordered that Cui be demoted to be the deputy mayor of Henan Municipality (河南), encompassing the eastern capital Luoyang.
However, it would be this article of accusation that would be Chang's downfall. Chang was effectively serving as the only chancellor at the time, but Guo Ziyi and Zhu Ci, due to their battlefield accomplishments, also carried chancellor titles but were not exercising chancellor authorities. Pursuant to the customs at the time, Chang, in the article of accusation, also signed Guo's and Zhu's names for them. Once the demotion of Cui was announced, however, Guo and Zhu both submitted defenses of Cui — surprising Emperor Dezong, who asked them why they had asked for Cui's demotion and then defended him; they responded that they did not know about the accusation. Emperor Dezong, who was not familiar with the customs that one chancellor should sign for other chancellors, believed Chang to have falsified Guo's and Zhu's signatures. He immediately ordered that Chang be demoted to be the prefect of Chao Prefecture and recalled Cui to serve as chancellor, although he still accepted Chang's proposal as to the mourning period.
Chang's friend Yang Yan later served as chancellor from 780 to 781. He had Chang promoted to be the governor (觀察使, "Guancha Shi") of Fujian Circuit (福建, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian). It was said that the people of Fujian Circuit were not learned at the time, and when Chang arrived there, he built schools and had the people taught in the ways of literature and rites. Thereafter, there began to be people from Fujian Circuit who stood for imperial examinations whereas there had not been. He died in 783 while still serving at Fujian Circuit and was given posthumous honors. It was said that the people of Fujian would thereafter offer sacrifices to Chang and their teachers in the spring and the fall.

USS Zafiro (1884)

USS "Zafiro" was a collier that served in the United States Navy from 1898 until 1904.
"Zafiro" was constructed in 1884 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by Hall, Russell & Company at Aberdeen, Scotland. Admiral George Dewey purchased her for the U.S. Navy at Hong Kong, China on 9 April 1898 just before his Asiatic Squadron sailed for the Philippine Islands at the beginning of the Spanish-American War.
Though the "Secretary of the Navy's Report" for 1900 indicates that "Zafiro" was placed in commission on 10 April 1898, her role as a commissioned ship must have been unique indeed for her complement showed only one U.S. Navy man, her commanding officer, aboard. Her status in the Navy from 1898-1900 is further complicated by the fact that there are no deck logs extant for her during the period; her first log begins on 20 September 1900. Finally, after her service in the Spanish-American War, which ended in August 1898, she had no naval complement on board until Ensign L. A. Gotten reported on board to assume command on 10 May 1900. Thus, the date upon which she was placed in commission cannot be established with any precision.
In any event, "Zafiro" departed Hong Kong with Dewey's squadron in April 1898 and served with it as a collier and supply ship during the Battle of Manila Bay and the ensuing Philippines campaign. The lack of documents covering her activities in 1898 and the first half of 1899 precludes any detailed narrative for that period. Presumably, she plied the waters of the Philippine Islands carrying troops, supplies, and dispatches between points in the archipelago. Based at Cavite on Luzon, she is known to have performed such missions during the period from July 1899-June 1904. Those movements—in support of the United States Army's suppression of the Philippine insurrection and campaigns against the Moslem Moro tribesmen—took her to a host of exotic places, and the length and breadth of the islands.
On 10 June 1904, "Zafiro" was placed out of commission at Cavite. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 15 January 1906, and on 21 October 1910 she was sold to Mr. J. W. Zeeve of Seattle, Washington.

Rowan Atkinson

Rowan Sebastian Atkinson, CBE (born 6 January 1955) is an English actor, comedian, and screenwriter who is best known for his work on the sitcoms "Mr. Bean" and "Blackadder". Atkinson first came to prominence in the sketch comedy show "Not the Nine O'Clock News" (1979–82), and via his participation in The Secret Policeman's Balls from 1979. His other work includes the sitcom "The Thin Blue Line" (1995–96).
He has been listed in "The Observer" as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy and amongst the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of fellow comedians. He has also had cinematic success with his performances in the Mr. Bean movie adaptations "Bean" and "Mr. Bean's Holiday" and in "Johnny English" and its sequel "Johnny English Reborn".
Early life and education.
Atkinson, the youngest of four brothers, was born in Consett, County Durham, England. His parents were Eric Atkinson, a farmer and company director, and Ella May (née Bainbridge), who married on 29 June 1945. His three older brothers are Paul, who died as an infant; Rodney, a Eurosceptic economist who narrowly lost the United Kingdom Independence Party leadership election in 2000; and Rupert. Atkinson was brought up Anglican, and was educated at Durham Choristers School, St. Bees School, and Newcastle University, where he received a degree in Electrical Engineering. 
In 1975, he continued for the degree of M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at The Queen's College, Oxford, the same college his father matriculated at in 1935, and which made Atkinson an Honorary Fellow in 2006. First winning national attention in the Oxford Revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1976, he had already written and performed early sketches for shows in Oxford by the Etceteras – the revue group of the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC) and for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), meeting writer Richard Curtis and composer Howard Goodall, with whom he would continue to collaborate during his career.
Career.
Radio.
Atkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for BBC Radio 3 in 1978 called "The Atkinson People". It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and Richard Curtis, and produced by Griff Rhys Jones.
Television.
After university, Atkinson toured with Angus Deayton as his straight man in an act that was eventually filmed for a television show. After the success of the show, he did a one-off pilot for London Weekend Television in 1979 called "Canned Laughter". Atkinson then went on to do "Not the Nine O'Clock News" for the BBC, produced by his friend John Lloyd. He featured in the show with Pamela Stephenson, Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith, and was one of the main sketch writers.
The success of "Not the Nine O'Clock News" led to him taking the lead role in the medieval sitcom "The Black Adder" (1983), which he also co-wrote with Richard Curtis. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, this time written by Curtis and Ben Elton. "Blackadder II" (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the Elizabethan era. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels "Blackadder the Third" (1987) (set in the Regency era), and "Blackadder Goes Forth" (1989) (set in World War I). The "Blackadder" series became one of the most successful of all BBC situation comedies, spawning television specials including "Blackadder's Christmas Carol" (1988), "" (1988), and later "" (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium.
Atkinson's other creation, the hapless "Mr. Bean", first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for Thames Television. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened somewhat to a modern-day Buster Keaton. During this time, Atkinson appeared at the "Just for Laughs" comedy festival in Montreal in 1987 and 1989. Several sequels to "Mr. Bean" appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. "Bean" (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in "Not the Nine O'Clock News". A second film, "Mr. Bean's Holiday", was released in 2007. In 1995 and 1996, Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in "The Thin Blue Line" television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.
Atkinson has fronted campaigns for Kronenbourg, Fujifilm, and Give Blood. Atkinson appeared as a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of adverts for Barclaycard, on which character his title role in "Johnny English" and "Johnny English Reborn" was based. He also starred in a comedy spoof of "Doctor Who" as the Doctor, for a "Red Nose Day" benefit. Atkinson appeared as the "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" on "Top Gear" in July 2011, driving the Kia Cee'd around the track in 1:42.2, placing him at the top of the leaderboard until Matt LeBlanc later recorded a 1:42.1 lap time.
Atkinson appeared at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony as Mr. Bean in a comedy sketch during a performance of "Chariots of Fire", playing a repeated single note on synthesiser. He then lapsed into a dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film of the same name (about the 1924 Summer Olympics), beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St. Andrews, by riding in a minicab and tripping the front runner.
Retirement of Mr. Bean.
In November 2012 it emerged that the character of Mr. Bean was to be retired. "The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me – basically quite physical, quite childish – I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of," Atkinson told the "Daily Telegraph"'s Review. "Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad. You've got to be careful." He has also said that the role typecast him to a degree.
Film.
Atkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the 'unofficial' James Bond movie "Never Say Never Again" (1983) and a leading role in "Dead on Time" (also 1983) with Nigel Hawthorne. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film "The Appointments of Dennis Jennings". He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut "The Tall Guy" (1989) and appeared alongside Anjelica Huston and Mai Zetterling in Roald Dahl's "The Witches" (1990). He played the part of Dexter Hayman in "Hot Shots! Part Deux" (1993), a parody of "Rambo III", starring Charlie Sheen.
Atkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in "Four Weddings and a Funeral" (1994) and featured in Disney's "The Lion King" (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the Red-billed Hornbill. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including "Rat Race" (2001), "Scooby-Doo" (2002), "Love Actually" (2003) and the crime comedy "Keeping Mum" (2005), which also starred Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Patrick Swayze.
In addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with "Bean" (1997) to international success. A sequel, "Mr. Bean's Holiday" (2007) also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody "Johnny English" (2003) and its sequel, "Johnny English Reborn" (2011).
Theatre.
Rowan Atkinson did live on-stage skits – also appearing with members of Monty Python – in "The Secret Policeman's Ball" (1979) for the British section of Amnesty International.
"The Sneeze and Other Stories", seven short Anton Chekhov plays, translated and adapted by Michael Frayn, were performed by Rowan Atkinson, Timothy West and Cheryl Campbell at the Aldwych Theatre, London in 1988 and early 1989.
On 28 November 2012 Rowan Atkinson reprised the role of Blackadder at the "We are Most Amused" comedy gala for the Prince's Trust at the Royal Albert Hall. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.
In 2013, Atkinson took on the titular role in a 12-week production (directed by Richard Eyre) of the Simon Gray play "Quartermaine's Terms" at Wyndham's Theatre in London.
At the end of 2013, he revived his schoolmaster sketch for Royal Free Hospital's Rocks with Laughter at the Adelphi Theatre. A few days prior, he performed a selection of sketches in a small coffee venue in front of only 30 people.
Comic style.
Best known for his use of physical comedy in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more heavily on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely deadpan delivery.
One of his better-known comic devices is over-articulation of the "B" sound, such as his pronunciation of "Bob" in the "Blackadder II" episode "Bells". Atkinson suffers from a stammer, and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.
Atkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of Buster Keaton, sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called "the man with the rubber face": comedic reference was made to this in an episode of "Blackadder the Third" ("Sense and Senility"), in which Baldrick (Tony Robinson) refers to his master, Mr. E. Blackadder, as a "lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard".
Personal life.
Marriage and children.
Rowan Atkinson is married to Sunetra Sastry. The couple first met in the late 1980s, when she was working as a make-up artist with the BBC. Atkinson was formerly in a relationship with actress Leslie Ash.
Politics.
In June 2005, Atkinson led a coalition of the UK's most prominent actors and writers, including Nicholas Hytner, Stephen Fry, and Ian McEwan, to the British Parliament in an attempt to force a review of the controversial Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, which they felt would give overwhelming power to religious groups to impose censorship on the arts.
In 2009, he criticized homophobic speech legislation, saying that the House of Lords must vote against a government attempt to remove a free speech clause in an anti-gay hate law.
In 2012, he voiced his support for the Reform Section 5 campaign, which aims to reform or repeal Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, particularly its statement that an insult can be grounds for arrest and punishment. It is a reaction to several recent high-profile arrests, which Atkinson sees as a restriction of freedom of expression.
Cars.
With an estimated wealth of approximately £85 million, Atkinson is able to indulge his passion for cars that began with driving his mother's Morris Minor around the family farm. He has written for the British magazines "Car", "Octane", "Evo", and "SuperClassics", a short-lived UK magazine, in which he reviewed the McLaren F1 in 1995.
Atkinson holds a category C+E (formerly 'Class 1') lorry driving licence, gained in 1981, because lorries held a fascination for him, and to ensure employment as a young actor. He has also used this skill when filming comedy material. In 1991, he starred in the self-penned "The Driven Man", a series of sketches featuring Atkinson driving around London trying to solve his obsession with cars, and discussing it with taxi drivers, policemen, used-car salesmen and psychotherapists. A lover of and participant in car racing, he appeared as racing driver Henry Birkin in the television play "Full Throttle" in 1995.
Atkinson has raced in other cars, including a Renault 5 GT Turbo for two seasons for its one make series. He owns a McLaren F1, which was involved in an accident in Cabus, near Garstang, Lancashire with an Austin Metro in October 1999. It was damaged again in a serious crash in August 2011 when it caught fire after Atkinson reportedly lost control and hit a tree. He has previously owned a Honda NSX. Other cars he owns include an Audi A8, and a Honda Civic Hybrid.
The Conservative Party politician Alan Clark, himself a devotee of classic motor cars, recorded in his published "Diaries" a chance meeting with a man he later realised was Atkinson while driving through Oxfordshire in May 1984: "Just after leaving the motorway at Thame I noticed a dark red DBS V8 Aston Martin on the slip road with the bonnet up, a man unhappily bending over it. I told Jane to pull in and walked back. A DV8 in trouble is always good for a gloat." Clark writes that he gave Atkinson a lift in his Rolls-Royce to the nearest telephone box, but was disappointed in his bland reaction to being recognised, noting that: "he didn't sparkle, was rather disappointing and chétif."
One car Atkinson has said he will not own is a Porsche: "I have a problem with Porsches. They're wonderful cars, but I know I could never live with one. Somehow, the typical Porsche people – and I wish them no ill – are not, I feel, my kind of people. I don't go around saying that Porsches are a pile of dung, but I do know that psychologically I couldn't handle owning one."
He appeared in episode 4, series 17 of "Top Gear" in the "Star in a reasonably priced car" section, where he drove the Kia Cee'd on the test track in 1:42.2, taking first place on the board, but was later beaten by Matt LeBlanc during the second episode of the eighteenth series, with a lap time of 1:42.1.
Kenyan holiday.
While on a holiday trip to Kenya in 2001, the pilot of his private plane fainted. Atkinson managed to maintain the plane in the air for several minutes until the pilot recovered and was able to regain control.
Honours.
Atkinson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.

Skunk (weapon)

"Skunk" is a malodorant, non-lethal weapon used for crowd control by the Israeli Defense Forces. Deriving its name from the animal of the same name, "Skunk" is dispersed as a form of mist, fired from a water cannon, which leaves a terrible odor of rot or sewage on whatever it touches. It does not wash off easily and is said to linger on clothes for up to five years. First attempts at developing a scent-based form of crowd control began in Israel in 2004; Skunk was first used for crowd control in September 2008.
According to David Ben Harosh, head of technological development for the Israeli police, the recipe is based entirely on natural organic ingredients, including yeast and baking powder, does not include any harmful materials, and may even be ingested without causing harm. The inventors plan to market Skunk to other forces worldwide. The development of Skunk followed numerous accusations against Israeli forces that they often employ disproportionate force in clashes with Palestinian protestors (e.g. using rubber bullets or tear gas), which has led them to seek new, non-lethal but effective methods of crowd control.
