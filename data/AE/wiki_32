Judo at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's 66 kg

The men's 66 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on September 7 at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium.
This event was the second-lightest of the men's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 66 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.

Norges Orienteringsforbund

Norges Orienteringsforbund (NOF) is the national Orienteering Association in Norway. It is recognized as the orienteering association for Norway by the International Orienteering Federation, of which it is a member. The association was founded 1 October 1945, and is a member of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports (NIF). Its first chairman was Kaare Thuesen. In 1946 NOF had 204 associated clubs, with just above 7,000 members. The number of clubs and associated members increased gradually through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and peaked in 1984 with 630 clubs and 34,000 members, and 35,000 members and 620 clubs in 1985. The next twenty years saw a decline in the number of clubs and members. As per December 2007 Norges Orienteringsforbund had 400 associated clubs and just above 24,000 members, distributed over eighteen districts. 
The federation publishes the magazine "Veivalg". Its current headquarters are at Ullevaal Stadion.
History.
The orienteering sport in Norway has its roots from the 1890s and the early 1900s. Then there was a long period of little activity until the mid-1920s, when the activity gradually increased. The sport was organized under the Norwegian Athletics Association from 1934, and in parallel also as a departement of the Workers' Confederation of Sports from 1935. During the World War II, the Nazi government tried to control all organized sport, which resulted in a general boycott of organized sports activities. Secret orienteering competitions, which were not under nazi control, were then arranged. From 1941 maps were confiscated and sale of maps was prohibited, which made participation in the secret competitions more risky. Orienteering sport saw an increasing interest among the Norwegian refugees in Sweden, and the sport was also part of the military training. About 300 instructors were educated, and about 2,800 compasses were brought to Norway from Sweden during the war. The members of Kompani Linge in Great Britain were trained in orienteering, and several orienteering competitions were arranged at Aviemore in Scotland during the WW2. 
After the establishment of the federation in 1945 the sport faced a series of challenges, including scarcity of equipment such as maps, compasses and boots, and transportation problems.
In 1961 NOF was among the founding members of the International Orienteering Federation, along with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, East Germany, Finland, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland and West Germany.
Norway hosted the first European Orienteering Championships in 1962 at Løten, and the World Orienteering Championships in 1978 (at Kongsberg) and in 1997 (at Grimstad).

O'Boylan

The O'Boylan (O'Baoigheallain, in Irish) or O'Boyland sept came from Airgíalla, having their principal stronghold in the barony of Dartrey in County Monaghan. They soon spread to reach eastern County Fermanagh across County Monaghan and southern County Armagh into the northern part of County Louth. They also established themselves to the south of their original territory, in County Cavan and County Meath. The name is still found most frequently in those areas, but invariably with the prefix O.
From the 8th century, The O'Boylan (O'Baoigheallain) sept are cited as early kings of Dartraige in present day Monaghan. The territory of the O'Baoigheallain during early medieval times stretched from Fermanagh to Louth before being reduced to the region of Dartry by the MacMahons after the Norman invasion. They did, however, remain powerful, and in O'Dugan's fourteenth-century "Topographical Poem" they are called "the bold kings of Dartry," and are praised for their horsemanship ...

Hustis House

The Hustis House is located on Main Street (NY 301) in Nelsonville, New York, United States. It is a small home built sometime in the middle of the 19th century, likely as housing for workers at the West Point Foundry in nearby Cold Spring. It has remained nearly intact since then, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
The house is a simple one-and-a-half-story frame clapboard-sided structure with a stone basement, its gabled roof sloping saltbox-style to create an extended rear first floor. Its doors and windows are trimmed with plain wooden sills and lintels. The only decorative touch are the pillars on the covered porch, which was added sometime after the house was built. A cellar door and shed addition on the rear also seem to have come later.
It is unknown exactly when the house was built. It first appears on an 1867 map of the region as the property of an E. Hustis but with an earlier construction date indicated. It is typical of the kind of vernacular homes found in Nelsonville, a community that was home to many workers at the foundry.

It purchased a large portion of the lands between Lake Simcoe and Lake Huron, including all of the territory upon which the Penetanguishene Road had recently been cut.
The Penetanguishene Road was cut from Kempenfeldt Bay on Lake Simcoe to Penetanguishene Bay on Lake Huron at the end of the War of 1812 for purposes of providing a military communication route. The land that it occupied was purchased in this treaty for the sum of four thousand pounds. The territory included a quantity of land that later became parts of the townships of Oro, Vespra, Medonte, Flos, Tay and Tiny in Simcoe County. The total area purchased was approximately .
The signees of the treaty on the side of the British included Provincial Commissioners Elisha Beman and Henry Proctor, Captain W. M. Cochrane commander of light infantry, Lieutenant Alexander Ferguson of the Indian Department, interpreter William Gruet and J. Givins on behalf of the crown.
The signees of the treaty on the side of the Chippeway included Kinaybicoinini, Aisance and Misquuckkey. (Chief Misquuckkey in the treaty may be the same chief whom Muskoka was named after.)

WBC Legends of Boxing Museum

The WBC Legends of Boxing Museum, located at the American Sports University in San Bernardino, California, is a museum that pays honor to the outstanding achievements and accomplishments of some of the greatest boxers of all time, more specifically past World Boxing Council champions. The WBC is one of the four (WBA,WBC,WBO,IBF) major sanctioning bodies in boxing. The museum's motto is, "Great fighters may retire, but their greatness lives on forever." This quote was created by Board Member Eric Casillas.
Purpose.
The museum enables boxing fans as well as the general public to come explore precious items and artifacts which are displayed for inspiration, learning, and enjoyment for the continued legacy of boxing.
History.
The World Boxing Council has been in existence since the early 1960s and has crowned some of the most legendary boxers to ever lace them up, yet in all of the United States, prior to the opening of the museum, there was no place that paid homage and housed the grand treasures and history of these great WBC champions. In June 2008 that changed. WBC President Dr. Jose Sulaiman, Founder and Chairman of American Sports University Dr. Hwang, WBC Supervisor Dr. Rudy Tellez, WBCLBM Co-Chairman Jaime Ochoa and Vincent Johnson and Directors Angel Ochoa and Eric Casillas are the founding fathers of this museum and spearheaded the creation. The Grand Opening was held on June 27, 2008 and an estimated 700 people including loving fans, civic leaders, press, media, and legendary fighters attended this historical event.
WBC Hall of Fame.
The WBC has a lond standing history of champions. The WBC Hall of Fame includes fighters like Bob Foster, Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Jose Napoles, Nino Benvenuti, Ken Norton, Salvado Sanchez, Ruben Olivares, Lupe Pintor, Marvin Hagler, Joe Frazier and more.
Board of directors.
The WBC Legends of Boxing Museum is run by a Board of Directors who fulfill duties ranging from the induction of fighters, design of the museum, setting and preparing events, contacting press and media, review and consideration of prized artifacts, hosting induction ceremonies, etc. The Board of Directors currently comprises 15 members.
Inductees.
Those that are honored and inducted into the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum are screened by the Board of Directors that rigorously review the achievements and accomplishments of the boxer nominated. The nominee will gain induction upon majority vote. If the boxer does not receive a majority vote decision by the board members, the individual may be nominated in the future for reconsideration of his induction into the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum. Typically, the boxer needs to be five years retired from the sport to be eligible for induction and must have displayed outstanding achievements and accomplishments in their boxing career.
Inaugural Members of the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum.
The first members to be honored and enshrined at the museum was the WBC Hall of Fame Class of 2008. Class of 2008 Inductees were Ken Norton, Danny "Lil Red" Lopez, Armando Ramos, Erubey "Chango" Carmona, Lennox Lewis, Genaro "Chicanito" Hernandez, Gabriel Ruelas, Diego "Chico" Corrales, Roger Mayweather, Rodolfo "El Gato" Gonzalez, Paul Banke, Bobby Chacon, Armando Muniz, Rene Arredondo, and Alberto Davila.
Lifetime Achievement Awards.
The museum also presents a lifetime achievement award. The WBC Legends of Boxing Award for Lifetime Achievement was established and sanctioned first in 2008 by Chairman Dr. Rudolph J. Tellez to honor an individual who has made significant fundamental contributions to the world of pugilism, either through a single branch of the sport or through a body of work combining different elements of boxing. These contributions, whether they have been in boxing competition, promotion, training, announcing, sports journalism, photography, leadership or mentorship, must have had a lasting impact on the boxing world and must have demonstrated a lifetime commitment to progress and promotion of the Sweet Science. The 1st Annual Awards were presented at the 2008 WBC Legends of Boxing Museum Inaugural Induction Ceremony at the American Sports University in San Bernardino, Ca, U.S.A. on 27 June 2008. Twelve awards were given on that day and were presented to notable boxing figures such as Cleto Reyes, founder of the glove manufacturing company Industria Reyes, legendary world champion trainer Floyd Mayweather Sr., world champion trainer and manager Bennie Georgino, Ken Thompson, owner of Thompson's Boxing Promotions, World Boxing Hall of Fame President Adolfo Perez, among others.
How Memorabilia is Placed into the Museum.
Items are placed into the museum by a variety of ways. Prized personal possessions are given to the museum for enshrinement by the inducted fighter. Items can be placed into the museum by the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum Board of Directors that are deemed of significant WBC boxing value. Items can be given to the museum by family members or the managing team of a deceased past WBC champion that is receiving an award or induction. Some of the memorabilia in the museum includes; autographed gloves, autographed pictures, WBC championship belts, posters, trophies from inductees, etc...
Memorabilia from Fighters that are on Display.
The museum is filled with memorabilia from past WBC champions that is showcased on standing glass cases, wall cases and more. Some of the WBC legends whose memorabilia are on display include Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Julio Cesar Chavez, Lennox Lewis, Marco Antonio Barrera, Ken Norton, Diego Corrales, Erik Morales, Danny "Little Red" Lopez, Roger Mayweather, Rene Arredondo, Bobby Chacon, Salvador Sanchez, and Laila Ali amongst many more WBC boxing greats.
Visiting.
The museum is open to the public and is free of charge. The museum welcomes all people to come view the treasures and history of the greatest WBC Champions. Special visits are available upon request and include private showings and tours for schools, boxing clubs, boxing organizations, community leaders, boxing fans, etc...

The Siege of Firebase Gloria is a 1989 film starring Wings Hauser and R. Lee Ermey that was filmed in the Philippines. According to a question and answer period in Sydney, director Brian Trenchard-Smith said that R. Lee Ermey wrote the screenplay.
Plot.
At the start of the Tet Offensive a Marine unit on patrol stops at Firebase Gloria. When the base comes under attack the patrol remains to help aid in its defense. The Soldiers and Marines come under numerous attacks by the VC (Viet Cong), but in the end hold the base with assistance from the First Cavalry Division. While the Marines try and defend the base, the Viet Cong commander discovers that he is in a similar position: it was never his mission to win the battle, but to lead his men to their deaths in order to allow the North Vietnamese Army to take a more substantial role in the war. The Marines are subsequently forced to abandon the base having lost too many men in the process of defending it. In the end, the soldiers and commanders on both sides take stock of the loss of life for this single base.
Release.
Although the film was written, produced and directed by Australians it was not considered Australian for the AFI Awards.

The art galleries were subsequently added in 1877 and 1931. Operated by Culture Warrington, Warrington Museum and Art Gallery has the distinction of being one of the oldest municipal museums in the UK and much of the quintessential character of the building has been preserved.
Architecture.
The museum and art gallery were built between 1855 and 1857 to a design by John Dobson. The building is constructed in brick and stone and is in two storeys. It was designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building on 4 April 1975.
Collections.
The museum's collection was originally based upon the collection of the Warrington Natural History Society but it has since grown and now includes a wide range of subjects such as ethnology, egyptology, geology, Roman Britain, pottery/ceramics, botany, fish, amphibians, reptiles, the Civil War, local industries, birds and mammals, and glass.

Special Women Police Contingent

The Special Women Police Contingent (SWPC) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police was created in 2008 to specifically track female criminals involved in criminal activities such as prostitution, drug smuggling and human trafficking. With increasing proportions of female criminals in Bangladesh, the SWPC, composing entirely of female officers, would be used to gather intelligence that men are seen as less capable of gathering.
Formation.
The Special Women Police Contingent (SWPC) was formed in 2008 with the intention of developing a special unit consisting only of women that would investigate crimes involving female criminals. Bangladesh Narcotics Control Department reported that as many as 100,000 people were engaged in drug trafficking, of whom 40 percent were women. Bangladesh Police considered male officers to be less effective than women in gathering information and investigating crimes involving women and had already been using female police officers more in tackling crimes involving female criminals. As an all-women force, the SWPC is the first of its kind in Bangladesh's history.
Activities.
The SWPC was created to gather intelligence and investigate criminal activities that have increasingly involved female criminals. The SWPC will track down female criminals involved in criminal activities such as prostitution, drug smuggling, human trafficking, theft, homicide and swindling. Female criminals have proliferated in crime as women have traditionally aroused less suspicion in the police and public.
Organisation.
Bangladesh Police has organised an SWPC within the Dhaka Metropolitan Police and plans to raise units across the country. Currently, there are roughly 2,000 women officers in Bangladesh Police - less than two percent of the total force and one-third of whom are deployed in the capital Dhaka. Bangladesh Police plan to train and hire 3,000 women officers to bolster the SWPC. An Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of the Dhaka SWPC who leads a detective force of 24 women officers.

Kahe Naa Kahe

Kahe Naa Kahe was an Indian soap opera. It was telecast on channel 9X. "Kahe Naa Kahe" is the story of Kinjal, an ordinary small-town girl with extraordinary dreams. The engrossing drama series marked the launch of 9X’s prime time programming on November 12, 2007.
Plotline.
The story focuses on Kinjal, a girl with a conservative father from a small-town background. Like other girls her age, Kinjal dreams of love and marriage but also wants to prove herself as an individual. Above all, she lives for her family. Kinjal’s progressive mother Urmila is aware of her daughter’s views and gives her unending support. Kinjal has four brothers and a father who thinks that while his sons can do no good, his daughter can do no wrong. When faced with financial problems, Kinjal goes against her father's wishes and starts working. Her father is unaware of this. Kinjal's best friend is Neena, who is a fashion model. Despite having different dreams and ambitions, Kinjal and Neena are best friends and tightly hold on to their friendship. 
Kanav is a young, dynamic, self-made businessman. He acts with a lot of arrogance. He hates his father because the latter betrayed his first wife, Kanav's mother, and married her younger sister. Neena meets Kanav and gets interested in him, though he doesn't like her. 
Kinjal's father learns that she is working. He is angry, but his family convinces him to allow it. He agrees with much difficulty. Kanav and Kinjal meet. They have many unpleasant encounters and start to dislike each other. But destiny has marked Kinjal and Kanav for each other, and they accidentally go through the rituals of marriage, though they don't know about it. Kanav unknowingly throws vermilion on Kinjal's forehead and they take rounds of the bonfire on the festival of "Lohri".
Later, Kanav decides to become a father. It is part of a complicated plan to defeat his step-mother and step-brother in a battle of succession. However, because of his bitter family history, he has no faith in love or marriage. So, he decides to hire a surrogate mother who will give birth to his child without coming in contact with him. In a strange twist of fate, through a mistake made at the hospital, it is Kinjal who is accidentally impregnated with Kanav's child. Kinjal's whole life turns upside down when her pregnancy is discovered. Neither her family members nor other people are willing to believe her protestations of innocence.
In the end, after many complications and conflicts, Kinjal and Kanav get married, to live happily ever after with their little daughter.
Cancellation.
After 5–6 months without much success, the show was pulled off the air due to very low TRPs. It was replaced by "Kahaani Hamaaray Mahaabhaarat Ki", another soap from the same production house.

Barnes Chine

Barnes Chine is a geological feature on the south west coast of the Isle of Wight, England. The chine lies just to the west of a small rise called Barnes High and south west of the hamlet of Yafford. It is a small sandy coastal ravine, one of a number of such chines on the island created by erosion of the cliff edge made of soft Cretaceous rock. 
This chine is difficult to identify as there is no obvious stream valley leading to the cliff edge, just a slight undulation of the gently sloping agricultural land. At the bottom of the undulation look over the cliff edge to see a small v-shaped gully descending rapidly to the beach below. The erosion of this chine is by underwater streams which emerge below the cliff top. The water probably comes from a small pond about 150m from the cliff edge near the A3055's Military Road and from the small catchment area to the west of Barnes High.
The Isle of Wight Coastal Path runs past the top of the chine.

Contingency sponsorship

Common in auto racing, contingency sponsorship is a form of sponsorship whereby race teams place decals on their vehicles from companies in exchange for awards for winning or meeting certain performance goals. These awards can be monetary or can include credits for free or discounted equipment. 
The best known example of a series with many contingency sponsorships is the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The front fenders of the cars are mottled with many rectangular decals that teams are either required or financially encouraged to place there. Some of the more lucrative contingencies are the Coors Light Pole Award and the Sunoco Rookie of the Year Award.
Contingency sponsorship can sometimes also include granting the right for the sponsor to use images of the driver and their car in promotional literature and advertising. Some contingencies require the team to use the sponsor's equipment as well as display a decal.

Lewis Samuel Feuer

Lewis Samuel Feuer (1912-2002) was an American sociologist. Initially a committed Marxist, he became a neo-conservative.
Life.
Feuer was born in Manhattan, grew up on the Lower East Side, and attended DeWitt Clinton High school. He graduated from City College with distinction in 1931, and was awarded a Ph. D. at Harvard University in 1935. for a dissertation in philosophy entitled "The philosophical analysis of space and time", supervised by Alfred North Whitehead. While at Harvard, Feuer joined Paul and Alan Sweezy in founding the Harvard Teachers Union. This represents one obvious example of his persistent involvement in radical politics throughout the 1930s. During World War II, he served as a liaison between the American and French Armies on New Caledonia, where he was demoted for attempting to organize the indentured Indochinese and Indonesian coolie laborers who were being used to build an airstrip for the Free French forces.
After World War II. he taught at Vassar College and the University of California at Berkeley, where he early witnessed some of the student unrest about which he was to write. He constantly challenged the leaders of the student movement and appeared in a widely publicized debate with student leader Mario Savio. He left Berkeley to go to the University of Toronto. His last teaching position was as University Professor at the University of Virginia, and was Professor Emeritus at the time of his death in 2002. 
Feuer visited the Soviet Union during one of the first academic exchanges in the period after Stalin's death, often referred to as "the Thaw" and was expelled for challenging Soviet orthodoxies regarding Marxist thought. His experiences at Berkeley, where he challenged left wing student movements and professors who ceded to their demands, led Feuer to reject left wing, radical politics and he wrote continuously after this period about the corrupting influences of ideology on thought, the dangers of totalitarianism in the modern world and the role of the United States as a bulwark against tyranny and authoritarianism in the modern world. His edited collection, "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Basic Writings on Politics and Philosophy" ( 1959) is one of the most widely used readers on Marxian thought ever published. Politically, he was closely allied with the philosophical anti-communism of Sidney Hook. 
His work ranged across a wide range of fields such as Marxist and neo-Marxist thought, the sociology of knowledge, the sociology of science, sociological theory, ideology and intellectuals, the history of ideas, the sociology of generations, the history and sociology of Jews and Judaism, and philosophy. He was one of the earliest interpreters of the relationship between psychoanalysis and philosophy and produced many studies of the psychoanalytic dimensions of ideology and intellectual life. His extensive knowledge of the more arcane intricacies of Marx's life and a deep love of the fictional character of Sherlock Holmes were the basis for a novel entitled "The Case of the Revolutionists Daughter: Sherlock Holmes Meets Karl Marx" (1983). The novel can be read as a critique of Marx's personal moral failings, which call into question his philosophy and politics.
After rejecting Marxism, Feuer reportedly adopted the mantra, "For Hegel, I would not give a bagel."

Gloria Neil

Gloria Neil (born January 13, 1941) is an American television and film actress. She is best known for her roles on "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." and "The Beverly Hillbillies", as well as the 1960s-era films "The Beach Girls and the Monster" and "The Karate Killers".
Early life.
Born in Phoenix, Arizona, Neil moved to Palm Springs, California in her early childhood. Her initial recognition came as a beauty contest participant. After serving as a California runner-up in the 1958 Miss Universe competition and as the 1959 Junior Rose Bowl Queen, she worked as a model, ultimately coming to the attention of Universal Studios, which signed her to an acting contract in 1960.
Career.
Blonde, blue-eyed and petite, Neil made a reputation as an ingenue, notable for her ability to shift rapidly from a "girl next door" persona to that of a seductress. She was first cast in the role of the effervescent "Melvin" in "The Lively Ones", a summer replacement comedy/variety show starring Vic Damone. "The Lively Ones" aired on NBC from July 26, 1962 to September 12, 1963, giving up its slot to the comedy "Hazel". This was followed by a 1964 episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show in which she was cast as an alternative-reality version of Mary Tyler Moore's Laura Petrie character, serving as a wish-fulfillment "Laura #2" in a fantasy by Rob Petrie, played by Dick Van Dyke. 
Her film debut came in 1965, in the movie "The Beach Girls and the Monster" (subsequently also marketed as "Monster from the Surf" and "Surf Terror"). Later featured on the cover of the " Psychotronic Video Guide" and hailed as a campy "laugh riot with lots of bongos, murders and girls in bikinis,", the low-budget film starred Jon Hall and featured a surf music soundtrack by Frank Sinatra, Jr. Playing the role of "Bunny", Neil was paired with her husband Anthony K. Roberts, a fellow actor who later achieved fame as a photojournalist.
Neil then returned to television in the hit show "The Man From U.N.C.L.E.", playing the role of Sarah, a beautiful-yet-brainy secret agent given to moments of whimsy. Although the actress Stefanie Powers was later tapped for a similar role in the spinoff series "The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.", Neil also appeared in "The Karate Killers" (1967), a theatrical release featuring "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." characters (and additionally starring Joan Crawford, Telly Savalas and Herbert Lom). 
While active in modeling and television commercials until the 1970s, Neil's last network television role was as "Miss Plumpett" on the 1966 season of "The Beverly Hillbillies", in which she played a sophisticated foil to Jethro Bodine, played by Max Baer, Jr..
Personal life.
Neil was married in 1960 to Anthony K. Roberts, her co-star in "The Beach Girls and the Monster" and the later the recipient of the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for photojournalism. She retired from active film work in the late 1960s, raised two children and served as the manager of Roberts' photography studio. Following his death in 2005 she relocated to Nevada City, California, where she remains active as a community volunteer.

In 1986, the school merged with Greater Atlanta Christian Schools. After seven years, families wanted a board and more local control of the school's operations. On July 1, 1994, the school was officially chartered as an independent entity. Since then the school has been blessed with its highest enrollment since 1974, while maintaining high academic standards and Christian principles. In August 2000, a high school hall was added, containing eight new classrooms, a computer and science lab, and a high school office.

1987 Winchester 400

The 1987 Winchester 400 motor race, the eighteenth annual (run yearly since 1970), was held under American Speed Association sanction on October 4, 1987, at the Winchester Speedway, in Indiana (USA).
After tying to win the "big one" for several years, Butch Miller had a day of career firsts as he captured the 1987 running of the "Winchester 400" and clinched his first ASA National Championship.
The race.
Driving the familiar number 52 Chevrolet, Miller started the weekend off by winning the pole for the 400-lap grind. At the start, Miller would cruise to an early lead as he paced the field for the first 115 laps. As Miller pitted under caution, two-time winner Mike Eddy put his Howe Buick at the top of the leader board for the next 60 laps, before he too headed down pit road on lap 176. That, in turn, handed the lead to Harold Fair who would hold the lead until Miller took over the lead for good on lap 276. Eddy’s hopes for a third win ended when engine problems sidelined him on lap 297.
Despite failing to lead a single lap, six-time winner Bob Senneker finished second ahead of Fair. Seeking a third-straight win, Mark Martin was on a charge in the second half of the event, making up two laps he lost with tire problems to finish fourth with Dick Trickle coming home fifth as the last car on the lead lap. Miller collected $10,600 for win.

New South Wales Z24 class locomotive

The Z24 class (formally B55 class) was a two cylinder, non-condensing, saturated 2-6-0 ‘ Mogul‘ type steam engine built by Dübs and Company for the New South Wales Government Railways of Australia.
Order.
Following the success of the B205 class, in 1889 the New South Wales Government Railways ordered an additional 25 locomotives of a basically similar design from Dübs and Company. These locomotives had a deeper firebox, steel cab and weighed an extra nine tonnes. They were pooled with the B205 class in general working. The first locomotive entered traffic on 10 March 1891 and all were in service by August that year.
Operation.
They took a generally unobtrusive part in main line goods traffic until displaced by the T524/TF939/K1353 class locomotives. They then moved on to branch lines until displaced by the C30T class locomotives which arrived in the mid-1920s.
Demise & Preservation.
As boiler renewals became due between 1929 and 1960, their numbers were depleted through either scrapping or disposal. Representatives found their way on to the private lines of such organisations as Bunnerong Power Station, Nepean Sand & Gravel at North Richmond and Hunter Region collieries.
The last locomotive withdrawn was 2413 in November 1960, following an enthusiast tour to Richmond. It joined 2408 and 2414 at Bunnerong Power Station until 1975.

Scutelnic

Scutelnic (also scutnic, from Romanian verb "scuti", "to exempt", "to absolve"; plural: "scitelnici", "scutnici") were peasant servants in Wallachia and Moldova who were exempt from state taxes. They were charged with various duties and were attached to "boiers" (land owners with military or administrative functions) and to monasteries.
The category of "scutelnici" was introduced by the reforms of Constantine Mavrocordatos. It was abolished in Bessarabia after the region was annexed by the Russian Empire on April 29, 1818 by the "Statute on the Establishment of the Bessarabian Oblast". 
The term is preserved in various names, such as the family names Skutnik, Skutelnik (alternative transliterations of the word from Cyrillic) and the settlement Scutelnici.

Judo at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's 73 kg

The men's 73 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on 8 September at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium.
This event was the third-lightest of the men's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 73 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.

Sugar Valley, Pennsylvania

Sugar Valley is a valley in Clinton County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
The valley gathered its name from the rich abundance and overall size of the Sugar Maple trees it held which were discovered upon first settlement. The dimensions of the valley are approximately eighteen miles in length running from east to west and approximately two miles in width. The two parallel mountains separating Sugar Valley include the Brush Valley mountain on the southern side and the Sugar Valley mountain on the northern. Two roads transverse the entire length of the valley and are commonly known as Winter Road, which runs along the Brush Valley side, and the other being Summer Road which in turn parallels Sugar Valley mountain. Winter road obtains its name because that the winter sun melts the snow on the north side of the valley first. The enclosing sandstone mountains slope to the limestone floor and shape Sugar Valley into a canoe-like form from a topical perspective.

They were killed in February 1801 at the east end of Sugar Valley in pursuit of a group of Indians known for stealing cattle and burning settlements throughout the Juniata and West Branch Valleys. This ended up being the last Indian massacre in Pennsylvania. A commemorative marker in Captain Greene's honor was erected and located off the Mile Run exit on Interstate 80 but has disappeared within the last twenty years. Contributing to Greene Township's growth, five villages and one borough were established: Bull Run, Carroll, Centerville, Eastville, Loganton and Rosecrans.

Gottlieb Schumacher

Gottlieb Schumacher (21 November 1857 - 26 November 1925) was an American civil engineer, architect and archaeologist who was an important figure in the early archaeological explorations of Palestine. He was of German descent.
Schumacher was born in Zanesville, Ohio, where his parents had immigrated from Tübingen, Germany. His father Jacob Schumacher was a member of the Temple Society, a German Protestant sect which in the 1860s established a colony in Haifa, Palestine. In 1869, Jacob Schumacher settled with his family in the Templer colony, where he became the chief architect and builder.
Gottlieb studied engineering in Germany, and then returned to Palestine in 1881.
He quickly became a leading figure in the construction of roads and houses. He was appointed Chief Engineer for the Province of Akko by the Ottoman government. Among his many works were the Scottish hostels in Safed and Tiberias, the Russian hostel in Nazareth, the cellars of the Rothschild winery at Rishon LeZion, and the bridge over the Kishon River.
One of his most important projects was the survey of the Golan, Hauran, and Ajlun districts, in preparation for the construction of the Damascus-Haifa railway, which branched off from the Hejaz railway at Deraa. As part of the same development he also extended the mole of the port of Haifa. In the course of this survey he produced the first accurate maps of these regions, along with detailed descriptions of the archaeological remains and the contemporary villages.
From 1886 he published articles reporting his discoveries in the "Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palästina-Vereins". These articles were reprinted in translation by the Palestine Exploration Fund "Quarterly Statement". He published a series of books, also reprinted in English by the Fund. From 1903 to 1905 Schumacher carried out excavations at Tell el-Mutesellim, the mound containing the ruins of the ancient city of Megiddo. The first volume of his report on Megiddo, covering the stratigraphy and the architecture, was published in 1908. The second volume, a study of the small finds, was published in 1929 by Carl Watzinger. Among his discoveries was the ancient synagogue at Khirbet Dikke.
His approach to excavation was, like most of his contemporaries, based on the careful clearance of architectural horizons, rather than the dissection of layers of earth. However, by the standards of the day the work was carefully recorded. His report is illustrated with a wealth of photographs of the excavated areas. It also includes simple but beautifully drawn sections, both a main section across the site from north to south and smaller ones to illustrate detailed stratigraphic points.
His main excavated area at Megiddo was a trench - across, running north-south through the center of the mound, in which he identified eight strata. He numbered these from bottom to top. Most of them may be dated, by the pottery found in them, to the Middle Bronze Age II-Iron Age II periods. His work was the basis for later excavations by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in 1925-1939.
Schumacher uncovered a number of important buildings at Megiddo.
With the outbreak of World War I, some members of the Templer community returned to Germany. Schumacher remained there until 1924, when he returned to his home on Mount Carmel near Haifa, where he died in 1925.

Croatian presidential election, 2009–2010

The first round of the fifth presidential election in Croatia was held on Sunday, December 27, 2009, with twelve candidates participating. The second round between first-round winner Ivo Josipović and first-round runner-up Milan Bandić was held on Sunday, January 10, 2010. Ivo Josipović won a landslide victory receiving 60.3% of the vote becoming the first elected president nominated by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP).
The incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was ineligible for re-election, so many candidates took the opportunity to vie for position of the head of state (the highest political office in the country, although in Croatia, a parliamentary republic, the role of president is largely ceremonial and the Prime Minister - Head of Government - wields most power). Most mainstream Croatian political parties participated in the election either by nominating a candidate or endorsing one, but major party official candidates alone did not dominate the campaign. The relatively low nomination threshold (ten thousand signatures in a country of four million voters), turmoil in the largest political party (Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ) due to the departure of long-time leader Ivo Sanader and the ongoing economic crisis, as well as a significant one-man revolt in the second-largest party (Social Democratic Party of Croatia, SDP), caused the first round of this election to field the largest number of candidates so far.
In the first election round, the voting body left of centre generally preferred three to four candidates, while the voting body right of centre generally split between five and six candidates. Because of the general left-leaning trend and increased fragmentation on the right, two candidates who were incidentally both long-time members of SDP came on top. The election polls accurately predicted the winner, while the runner-up projections were usually within a statistical margin of error, lifting many candidates' hopes and enabling a sense of drama stirred by the Croatian media.
The second election round was marked by somewhat more intense polarization, as it was to be expected in a two-way race. The Bandić campaign shifted their political message significantly to the right and kept attacking the opponent, as the Josipović campaign was put on the defense. However, a sudden reappearance of Sanader interrupted the election and cemented Josipović's advantage. In the end, Josipović won with a large margin.
Ivo Josipović was inaugurated as the third President of the Republic of Croatia on February 18, 2010.
Background and rules.
After serving two consecutive five-year terms, the incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was not eligible to run in the 2009 election.
The elections officially began on 4 November, with the start of the period for the collecting of signatures needed to become an official candidate. Each candidate had 12 days to collect 10,000 written signatures from citizens who are eligible to vote. After the 12 days expired, the signatures were verified and on November 18 the State Electoral Commission announced the 12 candidates that managed to collect the necessary amount of signatures. The next day the official 37-day campaign began and went until 24 hours before Election Day, which happened to be Christmas Day, midnight.
The first round was held on 27 December and no candidate managed to obtain 50% + one vote, so a second round was held on 10 January 2010 between the two candidates that achieved the most votes, Ivo Josipović and Milan Bandić. Each candidate could have withdrawn from the election at any time.
Campaign before the official start.
Although officially the campaign started on 19 November, in reality it began as early as summer of 2009. The main political parties had not yet announced their nominees for president in the summer, but certain high-ranking politicians had expressed their interest in running very early.
The governing HDZ saw considerable drama in selecting their candidate for president. Ever since late 2008, there was much speculation that prime minister Ivo Sanader would run for the presidency, although he frequently denied such speculation. After the local elections, the speculation grew as no other candidates publicly hinted they would run. However, Ivo Sanader unexpectedly decided not only to not run for the presidency, but to resign as prime minister and retire from active politics altogether, announcing his decision on 1 July 2009.
Sanader nominated Andrija Hebrang as the party's candidate for president, a decision that was backed by the remainder of the party's presidency after a while, but not before widespread rumours started about the HDZ member Nadan Vidošević, a prominent businessman, being the presidency's favorite candidate. Vidošević however rejected these claims. Hebrang also hesitated before accepting the party nomination, explaining it with health reasons. Vidošević formally announced his bid as an independent candidate on September 2, and was expelled from his party soon after that. Also, Ivo Sanader was not the only member of the cabinet to resign as Minister of Education Dragan Primorac also announced his retirement on the very same day as the prime minister. There was much speculation that Primorac resigned as he was not his party's candidate for president and that he resigned so he could run as an independent. The speculation proved to be true and Primorac announced his candidacy on 9 November 2009. He was then also ejected from HDZ membership.
The Social Democratic Party of Croatia also saw some controversy in the process of nominating a candidate. Immediately after the 2009 local elections and Milan Bandić's landslide victory in Zagreb as a candidate of the Social Democrats, there was much talk of his potential candidacy for president. Before the election, many influential members of SDP urged Zoran Milanović, the president of the party, to intervene and nominate someone other than Bandić, referring to numerous corruption and malversation allegations made against him during his tenure as the mayor of Zagreb. However, Milanović denied the widespread rumours about internal turmoil and publicly supported Milan Bandić in the mayoral campaign, making him the target of an open letter signed by many prominent left-wing intellectuals, in which they attacked Bandić and endorsed Josip Kregar. Although Milanović dismissed these charges, SDP conspicuously put Bandić at the bottom of the electoral list for the city council, which prompted further accusations of hypocrisy from their opponents.
On 20 June the SDP presidency chose two of their members of parliament as candidates for the SDP nomination: Ivo Josipović, a law professor and known jurist, and Ljubo Jurčić, an economics professor and former Minister of the Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship. Other candidates were allowed to be submitted, however, Milan Bandić refused.
On 12 July a primary election was held between the two social democrats and Ivo Josipović won with 64.78% of the vote from around ten thousand party members.
However, the 'Bandić problem' escalated in the coming months as the media continued to speculate about his potential candidacy. Bandić started to travel throughout Croatia without a stated common agenda, and the press followed his every step and constantly asked him if he would run for the presidency. He consistently refused to comment, drawing more and more media attention with his indecisiveness. Finally, the drama was concluded when he officially announced his candidacy for president in a speech on 5 November at 7 am on Sljeme criticizing Zoran Milanović and his former party for turning against him saying that he was one of the founders of SDP emphasizing that he stood with the party through the good and the bad times. Bandić was automatically expelled from SDP, losing his position as a member of party's presidency and leader of the Zagreb branch of SDP. Despite that, he declared on Croatian national television HRT that he still finds himself as true Social Democrat and that he'll proudly keep his SDP membership card nr. 2. SDP later made a statement that Bandić's membership card number was 38159.
By the time the nominations period started, most major political parties nominated their candidates for president:
The major independent candidates originating in the two largest parties are:
Several other candidates also had a history of association with major parties:
Political party candidates were selected within party elections, or were elected by party bodies, and they are the party's sole official candidates. All parliamentary parties have a policy to support only one candidate, and if their member announces an independent nomination, he or she automatically loses their party membership. Parliamentary parties that do not candidate their member for the president, usually publicly support someone. These parties can be listed on the electoral list for the president, but sometimes their support is just a public endorsement. Regional-right wing HDSSB supported independent candidate Milan Bandić, and regional-centrist PGS supported independent Nadan Vidošević.
After the election, the Constitution does not allow the President to be a member of any political party so he or she must resign from membership, if there is one.
First round candidates.
Out of 19 persons who submitted signatures to the State Electoral Commission, 13 of them were regular, but one of them withdrew. The following 12 candidates ran for Sunday, December 27, 2009, presidential elections.
General election campaign.
First round.
The official campaign began on 19 November as the country's electoral commission announced the 12 candidates eligible to run. Andrija Hebrang collected more signatures than any other candidate with over 140,000, Ivo Josipović was second with just under 120,000, Milan Bandić collected around 60,000, Vesna Pusić just under 50,000, while Dragan Primorac and Nadan Vidošević each collected over 30,000 signatures. At the beginning of the campaign, most polls showed Josipović with a healthy lead over his opponents. Although Hebrang held the second spot in most opinion polls during the summer, he fell to as low as fifth place by November. He claimed opinion polls have never been kind to his party as most conservative voters refuse to participate in them and expressed conviction that come Election Day he will be the victor. Despite Bandić's indecisiveness, he held second or third place in most polls during autumn. After he officially announced his campaign, most political observers expected him to get a bump in the polls, however that never materialized. After announcing his candidacy he continuously dropped in the polls, but still managed to claim second or third place. Nadan Vidošević led most polls during 2008 and early 2009, but never managed to take the lead after officially becoming a candidate.
Josipović based his campaign on the slogan 'Justice for Croatia' and kicked off his campaign with a rally in front of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. He attacked the current Croatian government and the prime minister Jadranka Kosor for ignoring the needs of the little man and criticized her for not dealing with corruption. Andrija Hebrang started the campaign with patriotic rhetoric with the slogan 'For a proud and European Croatia'. He praised Jadranka Kosor and her policies, mostly criticizing Dragan Primorac and Nadan Vidošević for abandoning their party, calling them deserters and traitors of their party. He argued that he offered Primorac and Vidošević an opportunity to settle the question of who will be their party's nominee for president through a primary challenge stating that they both refused.
Nadan Vidošević used his knowledge of economic issues to gain popularity during the recession. He emphasized his business success during the 1990s as well as his post as the president of the Croatian Economic Chamber (CEC). However, the press continuously raised the subject of his estate and property and how was he able to amass such an enormous wealth in a short period of time. He usually responded saying that everything he has he built with hard work and smart business moves. On 9 December Dragan Primorac accused Vidošević of nepotism, claiming that he employed three of his nephews in the CEC and that his secretary was related to him. Vidošević responded by saying he does not need someone who hits women teaching him moral lessons referring to allegations made to Primorac long ago which claimed he beat his former partner. Primorac accused Vidošević of lying and threatened a lawsuit if he did not apologize to him and his wife. During a debate held on 10 December Primorac and Vidošević exchanged insults, Vidošević repeating his allegations and Primorac demanding an apology. Finally, on 14 December Primorac announced he will be pressing charges against Vidošević claiming he caused great emotional damage to him and especially his wife. Vidošević responded by saying Primorac would do anything to gain attention saying his campaign was falling apart.
Milan Bandić avoided most debates saying he was a man of work, not of words. Most political pundits, however, thought he was afraid of confronting the other candidates as he usually tends to perform badly in debates. He based his campaign on the message that he was just one of the people, not an intellectual, but an ordinary hardworking patriot. Vesna Pusić heavily emphasized her gender in the campaign claiming it was time for a woman to make it to Pantovčak. Most commentators noticed she made the biggest change of image during the campaign out of all candidates claiming she lost her strict appearance of a professor becoming more accessible and open about her personal life. She based her campaign on her liberal and pro-European positions as well as her foreign policy experience.
The presentation of candidates on national television is customarily a contentious issue, with minor candidates complaining of lack of coverage and the major candidates complaining about dilution of campaign on fringe issues. Croatian Radiotelevision, as the public television operator, is legally obliged to give each candidate equal airtime, and they all got a half-hour interview in the late prime-time political show ""Otvoreno"". There were three televised debates held in the first round. The first was held on 20 November on HRT with 10 candidates present. Andrija Hebrang and Boris Mikšić refused to attend claiming they were discriminated on all national television networks. The second was held on 10 December on Nova TV hosted by Mislav Bago. Five candidates that were ahead in the polls were present, Ivo Josipović, Nadan Vidošević, Andrija Hebrang, Dragan Primorac and Vesna Pusić. Milan Bandić refused to attend. The main topics were the fight against corruption, the economy and the European Union. A poll conducted after the debate showed Vesna Pusić won the debate with 30% of those polled responding she did best, with Ivo Josipović coming in second with 26%. The poll also showed Ivo Josipović was the most specific in his answers with Vesna Pusić following closely. The audience considered Nadan Vidošević the most likable and Andrija Hebrang the most entertaining. The final debate was once again held on HRT on 22 December and was the only one with all 12 candidates present. The main topics of discussion were campaign spending, corruption and the suggestion of removing political immunity. There were four debates planned with the final one to be held on Nova TV on 23 December with six major candidates to be present. However, the six candidates behind in the polls objected saying they were discriminated by Nova TV, particularly Josip Jurčević who threatened to sue the television station and filed a complaint against it to the country's electoral commission. Finally, Nova TV canceled the scheduled debate and called for the change of Croatia's laws concerning media coverage of presidential campaigns.
Expense summary.
By Croatian law all presidential candidates are required to publicly disclose the amount they have raised and spent throughout the official campaign. They submit it through a standardized form to the State Election Committee (, DIP).
The first set of statistics were reported by the candidates before the final week of the campaign. The final amounts were reported to the DIP with the final deadline of January 25, 2010, and have been reported in "Narodne novine".
In addition to the input statistics, Croatian NGOs GONG and Transparency International Croatia have decided to hire a media analysis agency which calculated the amount of money that was necessarily spent on advertising on television, radio and print media. They point out that this is only the observable media spending, while they estimate actual cost to be in excess of twice the amount spent on the media.
All numbers apart from votes are in Croatian kunas.
Second round.
Immediately after the official results were published shortly after midnight 28 December and it was clear the two candidates to face in a runoff would be Josipović and Bandić all the major candidates gave their speeches. Josipović called for voters to vote for the light, not for the dark, while Bandić insulted Josipović saying he was a pawn of Zoran Milanović and nothing more than his remote-control. The following morning the official campaign for the second round began. Josipović denied being an SDP project calling himself independent and accusing Bandić of being a remote-control of Ivo Sanader, referring among other things to claims by Dragan Primorac that Bandić was the favorite of the former prime minister. Bandić denied the rumors, however the following day the media published a story claiming that Bandić and Sanader had a secret lunch that very day in a Zagreb restaurant. Bandić denied the rumors calling the journalists who published the story liars, saying the media's favorite is Josipović and that they would do anything to discredit him.
On Monday 28 December, the first day of the runoff campaign, the incumbent president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3 million kuna for the campaign saying he knows how much a campaign costs. He pled for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns so he knows how nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name of every single person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there could be one debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the fact that the president himself was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he forgot about the help he provided him during his two campaigns.
On 29 December Josipović gave a speech on an SDP convention held in Rijeka where he said that with the following presidential election the political map of Croatia would change forever and that by the next parliamentary election Croatia would be colored red, referring to his party's official colour being red. Bandić did not waste time and the next day attacked Josipović arguing that the next president should not be biased once again repeating his claim that Josipović is nothing more than a pawn of Zoran Milanović who would work in his benefit if he should win. The prime minister Jadranka Kosor also criticized Josipović's remarks as unfitting.
The first two second-round debates were held on the same evening, 30 December, the first on HRT starting a couple of minutes after 8 p.m., and the second on Nova TV starting a couple of minutes before 10 p.m. During the debates Josipović emphasized his untarnished political carrier as well as his knowledge of the law and the Constitution. He defended himself from attacks made by Bandić earlier in the week that he was one of those responsible for writing criminal indictments against Croatia's generals during the war, denouncing the claims as flat-out lies, saying that he offered legal aid to captured Croatian soldiers during the war.
The most direct attack by Bandić on Josipović came at the very end of the first debate when he accused him of damaging the city of Zagreb in 1998 by allegedly abusing his position as the head of the oversight board of a savings bank "Zlatica" to make a series of financial maneuvers that enabled him to collect his deposit of 138,000 Deutsche Marks from the bank "Komercijalna banka" that had been blocked and later went bankrupt. Bandić cited a court ruling from 2006 that had invalidated those maneuvers. Josipović defended himself saying that was merely a civil case which he was not even a part of and that he did not commit any illegal actions. Josipović also had to defend his damaging quotation that Croatia would be coloured red by the next election, saying that it was only natural for a political party to be ambitious saying he does not consider the remarks to be unfitting repeating once again that, if elected, he would be the president of all citizens.
The issue of whom Ivo Sanader supports unexpectedly escalated when Sanader announced he was returning to active politics at a Sunday, January 3 press conference, which resulted in a blitz uproar among the coalition partners, and subsequently his ejection from the HDZ party. President Mesić attacked Bandić saying the former prime minister returned to support him, trying to once again link Bandić to the most unpopular politician in the country. Bandić denied such claims calling them lies and distractions and once again accused Josipović of being a pawn of Zoran Milanović. At the same time, Bandić's ally Željko Kerum publicly stated that Ivo Sanader would be an "ideal president", but afterwards he backtracked somewhat, while repeating his well-known attitude on how the media is biased against him and Bandić.
Milan Bandić heavily used religion as an issue in the campaign, calculating that Josipović's agnosticism would be a turn-off for a largely Catholic country as Croatia. He constantly repeated the only one he fears is God and that he was raised as a true believer and a humble Christian, also making claims that he has the support of the Catholic Church. Josipović largely ignored Bandić's attempts saying he would be the president of all Croatians no matter their religious beliefs. The incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was elected twice despite his atheism. However, the Bandić campaign used all tactics to force the issue, even distributing fliers in front of churches after the Sunday mass across the country urging believers to choose between the cross and a red star, referencing communism.
Eventually, Josipović responded to the other side's discrediting tactics based on religion as well as the savings fund affair by raising the issue of how Bandić had divorced his wife in 1996 and because of that managed to buy out another apartment from the government with a discount, claiming Bandić violated the most sacred sacrament of marriage with the intent of making profit. Bandić responded in outrage saying he went through great emotional pain during his divorce saying Josipović was not a man unless he apologized.
On 3 January the third debate took place, hosted by RTL Televizija. The main topics were the return of former prime minister Ivo Sanader to the political scene, the economy, taxes and foreign relations, especially with Slovenia. Bandić once again repeated he was a man of work who would do anything for the people, while Josipović demonstrated his knowledge of law and foreign policy. On the next day, the results of a second set of election polls were published, showing Bandić made some gains, but Josipović's support was mostly unchanged.
The Josipović campaign released a list of 20 Croatian generals who allegedly supported him in the second round. This endorsement was subsequently used in campaign advertisements by Josipović. One of these generals, Nojko Marinović, denied any participation in the endorsement, calling it a "coarse manipulation".
Petar Janjić-Tromblon was also listed and he released a statement denying his support, saying he "doesn't want to be part of their games". The name of Tihomir Blaškić was also floated in the media in this context. Josipović was confronted about it during the third debate, and he claimed that the disavowals were made because of peer pressure.
The Bandić campaign also released their own list of associations of Croatian defenders who allegedly supported him in the second round, including the Association of the 105th Brigade of the Croatian National Guard, but the war-time commander of the 105th Brigade of the Croatian Army Stjepan Ivanić came forward to state that their association was both named and listed wrongly and said that their members were "appalled by the disinformation".
The Bandić campaign created a negative campaign television ad that used a recording of Josipović's words, but after the Josipović campaign complained, the State Election Committee banned it as a violation of campaign rules, while Bandić campaign complained of censorship. They eventually released a modified version of the same ad, just avoiding the use of Josipović's own voice.
The January 7 debate on Nova TV was held at 21:45, moderated once again by Mislav Bago. The two candidates had a somewhat more intense exchange regarding most issues previously discussed in the campaign. They once again compared tenure in the League of Communists of Croatia and SDP, their personal properties as well as moral values. Josipović called on Bandić to compare their physical and stock properties in court, which the latter refused. There was some talk of endorsements, and some reflections on talking points. They finished in a more cordial tone with the mention of future private visits as well as family pets.
The last debate occurred on January 8 on HRT, moderated by Branimir Bilić. Most common topics were covered once again, ending with some larger themes of international politics such as global warming and the inequality of the third world.
Notable abstentions.
The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) stated that they will not endorse any candidate in the second round, and have censored local branches that attempted to explicitly endorse Bandić. This happened to HDZ's mayor of Zadar Zvonimir Vrančić who first endorsed him but later disclaimed official support, and also to the HDZ branch of Makarska which also retracted their support under threat of sanction.
The Catholic Church in Croatia claimed that they're neutral in this; the Croatian Bishops' Conference states that they never endorse anyone. But, there are some signs of subtle pro-Bandić attitude: Croatian archbishop Josip Bozanić was visited by Milan Bandić in the Archbishop's office on January 2. The editor of the official church gazette "Glas Koncila" Ivan Miklenić, otherwise known as a vocal critic of President Mesić, did not endorse any candidate and instead expressed disappointment with both candidates, but later made statements that were interpreted to favor Bandić. During the campaign, numerous minor violations related to Church members were observed by GONG, in favor of Bandić.
Many first-round candidates endorsed the second-round candidates, but some made public statements regarding the second round but did not endorse. Dragan Primorac made several public statements - he initially tried to stay completely neutral, but later released one where he listed some characteristics of the future president that he would want, without naming a candidate, but focusing on the fight against corruption. The reception was mixed – "Večernji list" said he chose no one, while "Jutarnji list" said that he chose Josipović, reading between the lines. The Josipović campaign later decided to include Primorac in their endorsement list and Primorac did not seem to come forward with a public rebuttal. On the other hand, Josip Jurčević made a late public statement telling voters to void their ballot.
Expense summary including the second round.
These following amounts were submitted to the DIP before the final week of the campaign. The rest will be delivered and published after the second round. The amount spent calculation was done by GONG and TIH for the same period.

Summary of the results.
First round result analysis.
The first round of the election saw the lowest turnout of any presidential election in Croatia's history with only 43.96% of all the citizens eligible to vote participating in the election compared to 50.57% five years ago and 62.98% ten years ago. Most political observers noted the public's increasing distrust in politicians and the political system as the main reason for the low turnout.
Nationwide, Ivo Josipović obtained 32% and Milan Bandić 14%, meaning the two of them combined achieved less support than Stjepan Mesić did in 2005 in the first round only. The fact that there were only three actual left-leaning candidates meant the left was relatively united under Josipović, while the votes of the right were spread out on several prominent candidates, including Bandić, which was one of the reasons why no right wing candidate managed to qualify for a run-off. As such, this election became historic as a run-off would feature two candidates once in the same party, Josipović, who rejoined SDP a year before the election, and Bandić, who left SDP a month before the election so he could run as an independent.
The candidate of the governing centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) Andrija Hebrang came in third with 12% of the vote, a result noticeably better than most polls had predicted, but still seen by many as a debacle for HDZ as he achieved the lowest ever result for the party on a national level and also became their first presidential candidate not to secure a second round since Mate Granić in 2000. Nadan Vidošević, who was seen by many as a front-runner for the presidency in the beginning of the year, came in fourth with 11% of the vote. Dragan Primorac was the third prominent right-wing candidate who invested huge sums in his campaign, but in the poll he achieved only 6%, lower than what many polls had predicted. Primorac was indeed surpassed even by the centre-left candidate Vesna Pusić who was fifth, obtaining 7.25%.
No other candidate achieved more than 5% on a national level. Left-wing Damir Kajin made a decent showing in his home county, but was nevertheless surpassed by the right-wing Miroslav Tuđman in the overall tally. Slavko Vukšić's final number of votes was even smaller than the number of signatures that originally supported his nomination.
Josipović carried all 21 counties except for two, the Lika–Senj County which was carried by Andrija Hebrang and the Istria County carried by Damir Kajin. He also won the all major cities including the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, a sort of embarrassment for Bandić who is the mayor of the city. Bandić had won the Zagreb local elections, 2009 with almost 150,000 votes just seven months prior, but with a turnout of 41.69%/33.62% and under the SDP banner. This time he won only some 59,000 votes or 15.64% in Zagreb, with a local turnout of 52.40%.
First round election night.
As all the polls around the country closed at 7 p.m., the first exit polls were published by the major television networks. They showed Ivo Josipović easily claiming first place, but failing to obtain an outright majority winning 32%. The polls showed Milan Bandić, Andrija Hebrang and Nadan Vidošević in a statistical tie with each of them achieving 14%, 12% and 11% respectively. Andrija Hebrang's third place was seen as a great success as most opinion polls before the first round showed him with only single-digit approval, while Nadan Vidošević's placing was seen as a disappointment since most polls before the vote showed him battling for second place with Milan Bandić. The polls predicted Vesna Pusić and Dragan Primorac would be the only other candidates to pass 5% with each of them collecting 7% and 5% respectively. In 2007, during the parliamentary election, all exit polls predicted SDP would narrowly win, when in the reality HDZ turned out as the victor. With that in mind, Andrija Hebrang expressed conviction that when actual results were published, he would overtake Bandić and qualify for second round. He claimed that exit polls do not take into account the votes coming from the citizens living abroad and that conservative voters do not participate in exit polls as much as liberal voters. However, the exit polls predicted the outcome almost perfectly as the country's electoral commission's results later confirmed.
Ivo Josipović gave a short speech after the exit polls were announced saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction he would be the victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters just a couple of minutes before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear what he had to say.
Andrija Hebrang accused his party's dissidents, Vidošević and Primorac, as well as most right-wing candidates for 'stealing' his votes saying the result was that two left-wingers would face-off in the second round. Despite this, he called the election a great victory of the right claiming that right-leaning candidates combined achieved better results that left-leaning candidates combined. In making this assertion, he failed to consider Bandić as left-leaning, and ignored Vidošević's appeal to the left-leaning voters as well. Vidošević conceded defeat saying that one should never blame his failures on others, but himself. He urged the public to continue believing in a better tomorrow saying that Croatia should be a country of knowledge and justice, not of corruption and divisiveness. Pusić gave a short teary speech calling Croatia a country with a lot of potential with only the right leadership. She also noted that no government would ever be able to win without the support of HNS. Primorac said he would be forming a new party which would be independent from both HDZ and SDP and said he saw a bright future for Croatia.
This election night also saw great drama with the war of the television networks. Nova TV and RTL Televizija organized the exit polls together and offered HRT to participate, however HRT refused claiming they were unaware exit polls would be permitted as electoral silence lasted until midnight. HRT showed the results of the exit polls during their prime-time news show Dnevnik. Nova TV and RTL Televizija objected and demanded HRT to pay for distributing their polls.
Second round result analysis.
The first round of the election saw the lowest turnout for any Croatian presidential election ever, so many political pundits at the beginning of the runoff campaign predicted an even lower turnout for the second round. However, as the campaign started to become more heated and the electoral body more divided, it was evident the runoff election would have a greater turnout than the first round. The increase in turnout was 277,661 people, of which 268,166 cast valid votes. Overall, 50.13% of citizens who are eligible to vote fulfilled their public right. That's a little more than 6 percentage points higher turnout than the first round and on pair with five years ago, but 10 percentage points less than 10 years ago and the lowest turnout for a runoff presidential election ever.
Nationwide, Ivo Josipović achieved 1,339,385 votes, or 60.26%, while Milan Bandić won 883,222 votes, or 39.74%. Most polls before the election were showing Josipović with a hefty double-digit lead, but never as much as 20 percentage points as he achieved during the election. The difference between the two candidates came as a surprise to many pundits and analysts for two reasons: the polls usually favor the more liberal candidate since left-leaning voters tend to participate in opinion polls more than conservative voters; and the fact that most polls before the election didn't include the votes from the citizens living abroad, which was expected to be a strong boost for Bandić come Election Day. Nevertheless, the final result is similar to the result of the last several polls when only the certain voters were taken into account, which may indicate that few undecided voters actually went to the polls in the second round.
ć won all Croatian counties except for the Lika-Senj county, the least populated Croatian county. Similarly, he won all cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants and all cities that are county seats, except for Gospić, which is also the smallest. The capital city Zagreb was also won by Josipović, with a margin that was slightly higher than the national average. Bandić was unsuccessful in the majority of Zagreb boroughs, but he did win Lika and the extraterritorial electoral unit, where the majority of votes came from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The closest margins were in the traditional right-wing strongholds in parts of Slavonia and Dalmatia.
According to the exit polls Josipović won more than 90% of Vesna Pusić's voters and 70% of Nadan Vidošević's voters. He also managed to consolidate the traditionally centre-left voters winning 90% of his party's as well as more than 80% of HNS voters and more than 70% of the centrist HSLS and centre-right HSS voters, at the same time appealing to every fourth HDZ voter. Bandić won almost 80% of all Hebrang voters as well as 57% of Primorac's voters and obtained 3 quarters of all HDZ voters, confirming the assumption that Bandić mostly appealed to the right.
The result was not received particularly well by the Church gazette "Glas Koncila" editor Ivan Miklenić, who stated Josipović's legitimacy, but first pointed out that he was elected by less than a third of the total population, and claimed that he was supported by "obscure power centers". He concluded that the election is the result of a policy of continuation and "not a democratic breakthrough". The secular "Jutarnji list" editor Davor Butković lambasted that opinion, saying he was personally a Catholic but was offended by the notion that the Church would undermine the election result. Having a third of the electorate's votes is not relevant because not even the late Franjo Tuđman or even any single Government was ever elected with more than a half of the electorate. He concluded by asking why the Church is "insulting its faithful who voted for Josipović" and saying that as long as this kind of a stance persists, the Croatian churches will "remain empty other than on major holidays". The secular "Večernji list" chief commentator Milan Ivkošić once again called on Josipović to stay away from former President Mesić's "selective finger-pointing" which in his opinion particularly impacted the President's relations with Kaptol, in addition to a perceived "complaisance in the defence of Croatian national interests". He also noted that the new President remains "marked" by his agnosticism in relation to the right-wing voting body, but called on the Croatians to determine a basic consensus and avoid any accusations of "treason". Josipović indeed explicitly stated that he "will not step into that whole polemic" and that he has no comment.
Second round election night.
When the polls around the country closed at 19:00 RTL and Nova TV published the results of the exit polls conducted by Ipsos PULS. They predicted a landslide win for Josipović, giving him an advantage of almost 30 percentage points, significantly larger than all of the second-round polls. This shifted much of the political commentary and rendered much of the expected drama moot. The Josipović headquarters started celebrating immediately after the polls closed claiming that the difference is too large for Bandić to overcome and the exit polls don't feature such a large statistical margin of error. The Bandić campaign said they'll wait for official results, but admitted it would be very hard for Bandić to overtake Josipović's 30 point lead even when the votes from abroad were tallied. The exit polls predicted the outcome well as the ratio between the two candidates was 9 to 1 for Bandić abroad, where there were no exit polls, which narrowed Josipović's victory to a final difference of 21 percentage points.
After the official results were announced at midnight it was evident that Ivo Josipović was elected the third president of the Republic. He gave a victory speech shortly after thanking everybody who voted for him, but also saying he would be the president of all, not just the left. He called his victory a step in the right direction and said he would work hard for justice and a better Croatia. Josipović did not finish his acceptance speech before Bandić started his concession speech, using the opportunity to decry "hate, contempt and intolerance from everyone" towards him.
The Bandić self-victimization was ultimately not well received by both the voters and the media.
During election night, Milanović gave an interview to the three major television networks where he congratulated Ivo Josipović and called on Jadranka Kosor to hold a meeting with him where they would discuss the major political differences between their two parties and find a way to agree on how to help the economy further. The prime minister responded the very same night when she congratulated Josipović saying she invited the opposition leader for a coffee over six months ago claiming he refused. Milanović responded the next day by saying he doesn't want finger-pointing, but a constructive discussion about jobs, the budget and tax reform. They came to an agreement the following week and they held a meeting on 21 January.
Although HRT admitted they crossed the line two weeks ago when they reported the results of the exit polls conducted by RTL and Nova TV, they once again 'borrowed' the results for the second round election night. This caused a stir within HRT against the main editor of the news program Hloverka Novak-Srzić who was faced with scandals long before the election night incident. Finally, exactly nine days after the election, on 19 January, she was released of her duties as chief editor.

El Tesoro tequila

El Tesoro is a brand of tequila produced at a distillery in Jalisco, Mexico, where the family that founded the distillery is still involved in the business. In the United States, the brand is marketed by Beam Inc.. The producer claims to use labor-intensive traditional methods for making the tequila.
History.
Don Felipe Camarena was an agave grower who was raised in a family that had previously been making tequila in the Mexican state of Jalisco since the early 1800s. However, after 50 years of producing tequila, the family's distillery had been destroyed during the Mexican revolution of 1910.
Camarena started out by growing and selling agave plants to other distillers, and then in 1937 he opened La Alteña Distillery in Jalisco, 20 miles away from the previous family distillery. His distillery was located near a blue agave growing area and near underground springs which served as a consistent source of energy. Camarena then passed the business on to his son, Felipe J. Camarena Orozco, who then passed it on to his daughters and to his son Carlos Camarena Curiel, who is now the third generation of Master Distiller for the distillery.
The actual brand El Tesoro de Don Felipe began as the product of a joint venture established in 1990 between the Camarena family and the premium tequila promoters Robert J. Denton and Marilyn S. Smith.
The Fortune Brands holding company ended up, in 1999, buying the El Tesoro brand trademark and exclusivity contract from Robert Denton and Marilyn Smith. In October 2011, Fortune Brands divested itself of its various businesses that were unrelated to spirits, and changed the name of its remaining enterprise to Beam Inc..

Fred Andrews (rugby union player)

Fred Andrews (15 September 1864 – 2 June 1929) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Swansea Rugby Football Club.
Andrews gained his first international cap, when he was selected to play for Charlie Newman's Wales, against England on 5 January 1884. This was the first rugby international to be played in Yorkshire with the game held at Cardigan Field in Leeds. Although Wales lost the match, it was a landmark game with Wales scoring their first try against England. Andrews was selected for the next match in the 1884 Home Nations Championship, seven days later, this time facing Scotland. Wales lost again, though both Scottish tries were heavily disputed. Andrews was never reselected to represent Wales.

Swedish Trade Council

The Swedish Trade Council, founded in 1972, promotes Swedish exports on behalf of the Swedish industry and government. The organization’s aim is to make it easier for Swedish companies to grow internationally by providing the necessary services to establish a company and its products, services or ideas in new markets. It also helps to reinforce the image of Sweden as an attractive country to do business with.
The Swedish Trade Council has more than 60 offices in more than 50 countries and is represented in every Swedish region and county. Its head offices are in Stockholm and it is headed by President Ulf Berg. 
The publicly funded functions include export information, trade promotion, and regional export counseling, which are offered to all companies in Sweden. The Swedish Trade Council also conducts publicly funded targeted investments against smaller companies, strategic industries and relevant growth markets.
The Swedish Trade Council works within seven strategic business areas that mirror major Swedish export sectors: Health & Life Science, Food, Energy & Environmental Technology, Transport Systems, Industrial Equipment and Vehicles, ICT, and Safety and Security.
Currently, the Council has about 500 employees working in close collaboration with Swedish embassies, consulates and chambers of commerce. Formally, in most of these countries, its country manager holds the title of Commercial Counselor at the local Swedish embassy, and hence enjoys official status in the country. Normally all other staff, apart from local employed staff, are employed as civil servants at the Commercial Counselor's Office, which is a Swedish Government Agency.
In 2013 The Swedish Trade Council was merged with the government agency Invest Sweden. The merged government agency ws named Business Sweden.

Six Days on the Road (album)

Six Days on the Road is the title of the twelfth studio album released by the American country music band Sawyer Brown. It was released in 1997 (see 1997 in country music) on Curb Records. Its title track and lead-off single is a cover of the Dave Dudley hit from 1963. This cover reached number 13 on the "Billboard" country charts. Following this song was another cover, this time of "This Night Won't Last Forever", which was a pop hit for Bill LaBounty in 1978 and later for Michael Johnson in 1979. Sawyer Brown's cover was a number 6 country hit in late 1997. Also released from this album were "Another Side" and "Small Talk", both of which failed to make the country Top 40.
Content.
"The Nebraska Song" is a tribute to Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback Brook Berringer, who was killed in a plane crash in 1996. The song is track number 18, the same as Berringer's jersey number. (To make this possible, tracks 13 through 17 are blank.)
Critical reception.
Bob Cannon of "New Country" magazine rated the album 3.5 stars out of 5. He wrote that the band "serve up a batch of tunes that, while ever matching the emotional depth of 1992's 'All These Years', is a top-shelf collection that stresses the group's versatility." He praised the rock influences on some tracks and called "The Nebraska Song" "intimate", criticizing only the cover of "This Night Won't Last Forever" by saying that it was "as bland as the original."

Samuel Rea

Samuel Rea (1855–1929) was an American engineer and the ninth president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (1913–25). He was awarded the Franklin Medal in 1926.
Early life and career.
Samuel Rea was born in 1855 in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. His parents were James D. Rea and Ruth Blair Moore. His paternal grandfather General John Rea was in the United States Congress from Bedford and Franklin, Pennsylvania, during the terms of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Through the marriage of his father's siblings he was related to the Asa Childs and the Henry Clay Frick families. Samuel's father died when Samuel was 13.
He began his vocational life as a clerk in a country store. In 1871, Rea began his connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) at 16. He worked for the PRR for most of his career. He left the PRR during 1875 to 1879 to work for the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, and he worked for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) in the late 1880s.
Samuel Rea married Mary Black, the daughter of Jane Black. In 1880, Samuel and Mary lived with her widowed mother and family in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Their children, born after 1880, include George Rea and Ruth Rea.
By age 31, Rea was assistant engineer in the construction of chain suspension bridges over the Monongahela River at Pittsburgh. He began as a rodman (surveyor's assistant) in 1871, at a time when the PRR had hardly outgrown its original (1846) charter, which provided that it should extend from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh. Not only did he see the road pass through the greater part of the expansion which has made it a 12,000-mile (19,000 km) system, but it was directly through his efforts that the Pennsylvania secured access to Manhattan.
In the mid-1880s Rea supported a proposal by consulting engineer Gustav Lindenthal to build a large bridge across the Hudson River from Jersey City, New Jersey to Manhattan. Due to the enormous costs of the proposal, a decision on the project would not come for many years. In 1889 Rea resigned from the PRR due to frustration with his lack of advancement within the company, and he went to work for the B&O. He worked on the B&O's Belt Line project in central Baltimore, which included a new tunnel and the use of electric locomotives.
In 1892 Rea was rehired by the PRR and reported directly to President George Brooke Roberts. In his new position Rea explored multiple options for crossing the Hudson, and eventually renewed his support for Lindenthal's bridge proposal. However, other railroads declined to share in the project costs, and the financial constraints of the Panic of 1893 made that prospect unlikely for the rest of the decade. By 1900, as the economy improved, Rea and Lindenthal continued to press for the bridge project, but to no avail. The PRR then took a more serious look at building tunnels under the river, and this option was supported by Alexander Cassatt, who had become PRR President in 1899. Under Cassatt's and Rea's leadership, the New York Tunnel Extension project commenced in 1903 and was completed in 1910.
Rea later arranged with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad to build the Hell Gate Bridge over the East River, which gave the PRR access to upstate New York and New England.
In 1886, Samuel Rea became a member of the New York Stock Exchange—being the first seat held in the city of Pittsburgh. He remained a member for 12 years. In 1888, he published a book called “The Railways Terminating in London: With a Description of the Terminating Stations”.
President of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
Rea became President of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1913. As head of the PRR system employing 250,000 men, he became one of the three or four dominating powers in American transportation. Rea was considered largely responsible for many features of the Esch-Cummins Act, whereby the railroads were returned to private control in 1920 after World War I.
Samuel Rea was a member of the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, whose earthen dam failed in May 1889, causing the Johnstown Flood. After the flood, Rea removed to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to an estate called "Waverly Heights," designed by architect Addison Hutton. Waverly Heights later became a lifecare community in Gladwyne.
Rea was reared in the Presbyterian faith and said he preferred reading Prof. Moffet’s translation of the Bible. Samuel Rea retired as President of the Pennsylvania Railroad system in 1925 at the age of 70, having served as President from 1913 to 1925. He served as President of the Long Island Rail Road, a PRR subsidiary, from 1923 to 1928. Rea died in March 1929.
Pennsylvania Station.
Simultaneously with the tunnel project, the PRR began construction of its massive Pennsylvania Station in New York City. The project was completed under PRR president James McCrea, and the station opened in 1910. It was built to accommodate as many as half a million daily passengers, and Rea, who became PRR president in 1913, found himself defending against charges that the station had been wastefully overbuilt. Time was to prove him right. By 1919 the station was accommodating almost 35 million travelers a year, eclipsing the nearby Grand Central Terminal as the busiest New York station. Less than a decade later more than 60 million used it annually, enough to make it the most heavily-used railroad station in all of North America. By 1939 its yearly traffic had reached a then-record level of almost 66 million passengers.

Walker Community Library

The Walker Branch Library is a branch of the Hennepin County Library system in the East Isles neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is located on Hennepin Avenue one block north of Lake Street, adjoining the Midtown Greenway.
Original 1911 building.
The original building was built in 1911, when the Hennepin/Lake area was sparsely populated. T. B. Walker, the president of the library board at the time, donated some land for the site of the library. The opening of this library coincided with the opening of a streetcar line on Lake Street, and it helped fulfill head librarian Gratia Countryman's wishes to expand the library system and bring books closer to people. Local architect Jerome Paul Jackson designed the library in a Classical Revival design. The portico, with Ionic columns, shows Beaux-Arts characteristics.
1981 building.
In 1981, the growth of the library required a new building, which was built just across the street at 2880 Hennepin Avenue South. The two main floors of the building were underground. There was a large "LIBRARY" sign on Hennepin Avenue with an entry pavilion to indicate the presence of the library. Although the library was built underground to conserve space and save energy, the underground building was not very visible, and had problems with water seepage. By 2006, proposals were being considered to replace the library with something that would be more visible. 
2014 building.
The 1981 building closed on September 22, 2012; it was torn down by Carl Bolander and Sons and replaced with a new building by Shaw-Lundquist and Associates that will open in 2014.

Palenque, Chiapas

Palenque is a city and municipality located in the north of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The city was named almost 200 years before the famous nearby Mayan ruins were discovered in the 18th century. The area has a significant indigenous population, mostly of the Ch'ol people, a Mayan descendent. The city is the only urban area in a municipality of over 600 communities and it is surrounded by rainforest. However, deforestation has had dramatic effects on the local environment, with howler monkeys occasionally seen in the city itself as they look for food. While most of the municipality’s population is highly marginalized economically, working in agriculture, the Palenque archeological site is one of the most important tourist attractions for both the area and the state of Chiapas. It is the poorest major city in the state of Chiapas.
The town and municipality.
Palenque refers both to the modern city and the municipality for which it is the local governing authority. As of 2005, the city had a population of 37,301, more than a third of the population of the municipality The city of Palenque is the only urban area of the municipality which consists of 679 other communities covering a territory of 1,122.80km2. The city was founded in 1567 by Pedro Lorenzo. In 1573, the community was presented with three bells as a symbol of its foundation. Of the three only one survives, which is found in the main church of the city. Although it is a city, it is surrounded by jungle vegetation only sixty meters above sea level, which contains many of Chiapas’ emblematic species such as the howler monkey. These monkeys have been seen within the city of Palenque itself, since the lack of range forces them to look for food near human settlements; some become lost or disoriented and are even run over by cars. One creature so injured was taken to the Eco Parque Aluxes for medical treatment. 
The municipality borders the municipalities of Catazajá, La Libertad, Ocosingo, Chilán and Salto de Agua. It also borders the state of Tabasco and the country of Guatemala to the east. Aside from the municipal seat, other important communities include Río Chancala, Bajadas Grandes. Agua Blanca Serranía, Dr. Samuel León Brindis, Nueva Esperanza Primera Sección, Lázaro Cárdenas, Emilio Rabasa and El Naranjo. The city as an altitude of sixty meters above sea level. 
As of 2005, the municipality has 20,222 inhabited residences, with about 80% the property of the residents. Average number of residents per unit is 4.84, under the regional average of 5.32 and on par with the state average. About 37% of these residences have dirt floors, 55% with cement floors and under 7% with wood, mosaic or other flooring. Over 52% of units have wood walls, with about 42% made of block. About 56% of units have asbestos or metallic roofs, with just under 19% having a concrete slab for a roof. 86.37% of residences have electricity, 75.81% have running water, and 56.77 have sewerage systems. These are above region average and on par with the state average.
The municipality has 28 post offices and a telegraph office. There are also telephone centers for those who do not have home service. The municipality contains 569.99 km of roadway, with mostly rural roads (137.46 km) and state highways (149.20 km). The municipality has 14.8% of the Selva region's highways. The municipality is reached by Highway 199 from San Cristóbal and Highway 186 from Escárcega.
From 1990 to 2000, the population grew from 63,209 to 85,464. The rate of population growth is 3.12%, higher than that of the region and state at 2.32 and 2.05 respectively. It is predicted to double within 25 years. About 35% live in urban areas with the rest dispersed in 679 rural communities, or over 99% of all of the municipality’s communities. Its population density is 76 per km2, well above the regional average of 29/km2 and state average of 52/km2. However, the birth rate is 3.53 per woman of reproductive age versus 4.26 for the region and about average for the state. 
As of 2000, the rate of illiteracy was 23.77%, down from 31.43% in 1990. The state average is 22.91%. For those over the age of fifteen, 27.66% have not finished primary school. 15.73% have only finished primary school, and 31.5% have studied beyond this level.
The city and municipality area have a large Ch'ol indigenous population. As of 2005, there were 37,032 people who spoke an indigenous language, out of a total population of 85,464. Just over forty percent (40.60%) of the population is indigenous compared to just under 25% for the state and just under 65% for the region. The predominant ethnicity is Ch’ol. Just over twenty percent of indigenous residents do not speak Spanish. The municipality sponsors an annual Festival Mundo Maya (Mayan World Festival) in April focusing on the culture, folklore, crafts, food and clothing of the indigenous people descended from the Mayas. The event attracts participants from Tabasco, Yucatán, Campeche and parts of Puebla .
About 53% profess the Catholic faith, with 25.67 Protestant, 5.44 Evangelical and 14.83% professing no religion. The municipality's Protestant and Evangelical percentages are higher than that of the state in general. The most important religious celebrations are feast of Saint Dominic and Francis of Assisi . Each year, the city of Palenque sponsors a passion play, selecting one young man from the area to play Jesus. The play mirrors the 14 Stations of the Cross, ending with the crucifixion. The event begins at the parish church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán.
History.
The name Palenque comes from Spanish and means “wood stake fence.” It is a literal translation of the Ch’ol word “otulún” which means fenced or fortified place. The modern town was founded by Friar Pedro Lorenzo near the ruins of the same name in 1567. It was founded to congregate the Ch’ol indigenous families that were dispersed in this part of the Lacadon rainforest. In 1768, the state of Chiapas was divided into “alcaldía mayores” with Palenque belonging to that of Ciudad Real (San Cristóbal de las Casas). In 1813, the settlement was officially declared a town. In 1821, a road between Bachajon and Palenque was constructed, and the town’s first school was established in 1828. In 1847, the area became part of the department of Tila, but two year later, it was made into its own department. The annual fair of Santo Domingo (Saint Dominic) was officially authorized in 1877. In 1883, the state was reorganized into twelve departments with Palenque as head of one of them. A railroad connecting the town with the Gulf of Mexico was constructed at this time, with the Pakalna station, which still exists. The municipality system was created in the state in 1915, with Palenque head of its own municipality. The first airfield was established in 1931 and mail and telegraph arrived in 1941.In 1972, it was declared a city by the governor of the state of Chiapas. The Casa de Cultura was founded in 1980 with the main road paved in 1990. The Cecytec technical college was founded in 1994. The modern airport was created in 1997.
The ancient Mayan site of Palenque was unknown to the Spanish when they founded the town, but since its discovery in 1740 by Father Antonio Solís, it has been important to the city and municipality both culturally and economically. The ruins were officially visited in 1773 by Ramon Ordóñez de Aguilar representing the province of Guatemala, to which Chiapas belonged. The ruins were visited by English explorer Thomas McKay in 1822. The tomb of Pakal was discovered by Alberto Ruz Lhuillier in 1951. The Palenque site museum was established in 1958. Today, the site is one of the most important tourism attractions in Chiapas.
Environment.
Most the municipality lies on the plains that lead north to the Gulf of Mexico with small portions located in the mountains called the Montañas del Oriente and the Montañas del Norte. It is part of the Selva region of the state, and borders the Lacandon Jungle. Its climate is hot and humid with rains all year round. It has mostly tropical rainforest vegetation; however, much of this has been over exploited with many forest areas devastated. Among its rivers are the Usumacinta, with tributaries Chamacax, Chancalá, Chocoljaito along with Bascán, Michol, San Simón and Trapiche. There is one lake called Lago Metzaboc.
The municipality is home to the Palenque National Park and the Metzabok Conservation Zone. The first was established in 1981, and covers the areas were the Montañas del Norte meet the coastal plain, an area of 1771.95 hectares. It was established to conserve perennial rainforest which is in danger of disappearing as well as a number of endangered species. The park surrounds the archeological site of Palenque, and both the site and the park are listed together as a World Heritage Site. It was established in 1981. The national park is home to a number of emblematic Chiapan species including the howler monkey, which is endangered due to deforestation. Metzabok was established in 1996 in the Montañas de Oriente extending from Palenque into neighboring Ocosingo. It has an area of 3337.8 hectares of highly diverse and fragile ecosystems of both perennial and deciduous rainforest as well as some mesophile forest.
Economy and tourism.
The municipality is considered to be highly marginalized economically. Of those economically active, 51.86 are employed in farming and livestock. 49.26% of those in this sector do not receive wages, with only half a percent receiving more than five payments per year. 10.36% are employed in construction and industry, of which just under six percent do not receive payment. 35.62% are employed in commerce and services including tourism. This is above the regional average and about equal to the state average. About 6.5% of these workers do not receive any wages.
The main tourist attraction is the archeological site of Palenque, located seven km from the city. This site is one of the most important for the state, as it is known internationally. The site is part of the Maya Route, which also includes sites such as Yaxchilan and Bonampak all in the Lacandon Jungle . Tourism infrastructure includes 67 hotels with just under 2,000 rooms, almost all location in the city of Palenque. Palenque is one of the sites in Mexico which receives large numbers of visitors for the spring equinox, along with Teotihuacan, and Chichén Itzá. Each year, the municipality, along with other government agencies, put in place extra security measures during Holy Week, as this is a major vacation period in Mexico, bringing large numbers of visitors to the area. Extra safeguards are also put into place to protect the ruins at the Palenque site as well.
The ancient city was a major one of the Mayan civilization, which developed during the Classic period. The main attractions of the site include the Temple of the Inscriptions and the Palace. The site is noted for the size of its buildings as well as number and large number of glyph inscriptions. It is also the site of the tomb of King Pakal, discovered in the 1950s, one of the most important Mayan discoveries of the 20th century. The largest and most complex structure is the Palace with its four story tower. Other important structures include Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Foliated Cross and the Temple of the Sun. The site has its own museum in the National Park area in a modern building, with an addition made in 1995. There are two main halls with one temporary one. It focuses on the ancient city’s importance in Mayan world and the history of its excavation, including work done as recent as the mid 1990s.
Lesser known are a number of ecotourism sites. One of the most recent ecotourism parks to be created include the “Ecoparque los Aluxes” just outside the city of Palenque. It is a conservation center with facilities to rescue wildlife. It also has natural enclosures containing species such as jaguars, ocelots, bobcats, red and green macaws, spider monkeys, parrots, turtles and various bird species. The facility has relations with other similar ecotourism parks such as Xcaret Park. One of the institution’s goals is to release fifty macaws per year into the surrounding Palenque National Park. The Palenque National Park surrounds the archeological site of the same name and includes dense tropical rainforest and streams with blue waters. Together, they have been classified as a World Heritage Site. Near the park are two major waterfalls called Agua Azul and Misol Há. The park contains hiking paths to see the various areas of vegetations along with streams and small waterfalls. The rainforest contains numerous birds and howler monkeys.

Colchester New Church

Colchester New Church is a Christian New Church in Colchester, England which has as its theological basis the Old and New Testaments and the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Colchester New Church is part of the General Church of the New Jerusalem.
History.
Colchester New Church began on 26 July 1816 when Rev. Robert Hindmarsh came to give a public lecture in Colchester. Shortly after this lecture a small group formed. They rented various rooms in town for their worship and discussions. In the minutes of the 46th General Conference in 1853, Colchester New Church is listed as having 11 members, and renting a chapel in St. Helen's Lane with U. W. Mattocks as the leader. After this point the history of the Colchester New Church is uncertain until 1880 when George McQueen found the Writings of Swedenborg. In June, 1880, Mr. McQueen read Isaac Pitman's "Emanuel Swedenborg, the Spiritual Columbus," a little book which quoted from the Swedenborg's Writings. On his 20th birthday, Sunday, September 12, 1880, George McQueen walked the 10 miles to Brightlingsea to attend the New Church service and with him walked "Eb" Finch. In 1881 Rev. J. Deans began a series of lectures in Colchester, and a group was formed. Their first official worship was conducted on April 16 of the same year, and in June they rented a room, Shaftsbury Hall. Mr. William Gill joined the society shortly after its formation and became one of its lay preachers. Two members of the society gave money to help finance a church building, but the building did not materialize for 42 years.
In 1885 Rev. C. Griffiths became the pastor in Brightlingsea, and Colchester appointed him as their honorary pastor. At this point the Colchester New Church is still a part of the General Conference. However, in 1885 the Colchester society began to read sermons from "New Church Life" for their Sunday worship. "New Church Life" is a periodical of the General Church of the New Jerusalem. This might very well have been the beginning of the attraction to the distinctive ideas and principles of the General Church and its Academy movement.
In 1890 Rev. C. Griffiths withdrew from the Colchester society because he disagreed with the members' strong sympathies for the General Church of the New Jerusalem. On July 6, Rev. William Frederic Pendleton (of the General Church) gave a sermon that greatly pleased the members in Colchester. On the same day Mr. McQueen became a member of the General Church Academy. The next year in 1891, on 27 March, the Colchester New Church officially withdrew from the Conference to become part of the General Church of the New Jerusalem.
In 1905 William Frederic Pendleton (by now the bishop of the General Church of the New Jerusalem) visited Colchester and discussed the possibility of opening a school, but it was decided that the time was not yet ripe for that.
In 1924 the church building was erected on 175 Maldon Road and around the same time Rev. Gyllenhaal became pastor of the society. In 1926 a day school was started under Muriel Gill.
In 1967 under the leadership of Rev. Frank Rose the church building was expanded. The sanctuary was extended two metres in length, a new school room, and a new entrance porch were added. The designer of the new additions was architect Geoff P. Dawson. The plan had been to dedicate the new school room on December 10, 1966. But the building work only finished in mid January 1967, and it was dedicated by bishop Willard Dandridge Pendleton on 15 April of the same year.

29 September 2008 western India bombings

In the 29 September 2008 Western India bombings, three bombs exploded in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra of India killing 8 persons and injuring 80. Two bombs went off in Malegaon, Maharashtra, which killed seven people while another blast in Modasa, Gujarat resulted in the death of one person.
Background.
India witnessed a surge in terror attacks since May 2008, when a series of blasts in Jaipur killed 63. Since then, other major Indian cities including Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi were targeted.
On 29 September 2008, police in Ahmedabad, Gujarat foiled another terror attack when 17 bombs were found and defused. However, a low-intensity bomb exploded at a market packed with Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast, killing one and wounding 15. Another bomb placed near a Temple in Faridabad was found and defused. Furthermore, the bombs were purportedly similar to those that exploded in Delhi two days before this attack.
The explosions in Malegaon and Modasa took place on the eve of Navratri, a major Hindu festival celebrated across India.
Blast.
The Malegoan blast occurred near a hotel at Bhikku Chowk in Maharashtra. The bombs were allegedly fitted onto a Hero Honda motorcycle and rigged to detonate. Both blasts were said to be of low intensity.
There had been confusion earlier about what had caused the blast with some suggesting that it was caused by an accidental explosion of a gas cylinder. But the police later confirmed that the blast was a terrorist attack.
The Modera blasts, resulting in the death of a 15-year-old boy, as well as several others injured, was a result of a low-intensity bomb kept on a motorcycle that went off near a mosque at the Muslim-dominated Sukka Bazaar. The incident took place around 21:26 when special Ramzan prayers (tarawih) were being offered inside the mosque.
Aftermath.
CNN-IBN reported that after the blast a mob of 20,000 gathered near the blast site, following which the state of Maharashtra deployed Reserve Police Force to prevent any mob violence. The police brought the situation under control after a brief clash with the mob.
Amidst rising security concerns, Gujarat plans to deploy police in heavy numbers during the "garba" festivities.
Investigation.
Mumbai Police deployed Anti Terrorism Squad to assist the local investigating authorities in Malegaon. Police say that unsophisticated, crude bombs, identical to those that detonated in Delhi 3 days before, were used. The investigation was led by Mumbai Anti Terrorism Squad chief Hemant Karkare, who was later killed in the 2008 Mumbai Attacks.
Police across India, especially in Delhi, received a number of hoax calls and SMSes, hampering the investigation.
On 5 October police said they had arrested a man in connection to the bombings. PTI reported that further investigations were under way, with more arrests expected.
Alleged perpetrators.
Malegaon blasts.
During investigation in Maharashtra, alleged evidence was made ascertaining the involvement of a Hindu group/s in the blasts. The three arrested were identified as "Sadhvi" Pragya Singh Thakur, Shiv Narayan Gopal Singh Kalsanghra and Shyam Bhawarlal Sahu. All three were produced before the Nashik Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court, which had remanded them to police custody till 3 November. This follows from an earlier claim by the Maharashtra ATS that Hindu groups were behind the blasts. The ATS breakthrough came through the motorcycle used in the blast, which was traced to the owner in Surat who was said to have had Hindutva links. The ATS added that this group could also be behind the blast in Modasa, Gujarat.
Adding to this suspicion, the name of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) came up during investigations after a bike was found near the blasts site in Malegaon, though there was no mention of organisation's involvement in issue. However, the bike allegedly belonged to Pragya Singh Thakur, who had been an ABVP activist in 1997, but sold the bike before she took to a spiritual quest. Sunil Bansal, regional organizing secretary of the ABVP, said: "First ATS mentioned the possibility of Vidyarthi Parishad and VHP being involved in the blasts and then the matter was also raised in Rajya Sabha by a Congress MP. But ABVP is in no way involved in the blasts. ABVP has even demanded that there should be a proper inquiry and ATS should come out with an evidence and not talk without any basis. They don't have any proof against any ABVP activist." After the arrest of three Hindus, a Hindu group Sri Ram Sena, offered legal assistance to the accused. SRS had recently been in news for allegedly vandalising an M F Husain exhibition in Delhi, as well as for attacking churches in Karnataka. The SRS said the three accused were being made "political victims" by the Congress to hide its own inadequacies. General secretary, Binay Singh, said: "The Maharashtra government is raking up the Malegaon blast issue to divert attention from the hooliganism of Raj Thackeray while in the Centre the government is looking for an issue to cover up the Batla House encounter incident." Additionally, Bharatiya Janashakti president Uma Bharti also defended Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, saying: "Pragya had been a disciple of Maharaj Avdesh Anand and there was no way in which she could be part of any violent activity."
On 25 October, two more persons, suspected ex-army personnel, were also questioned in Pune in connection with the Malegaon blast Mumbai.
Two days later, the total arrest count mounted to 7 when the ATS took in Sameer Kulkarni from Bhopal and Sangram Singh from Indore for questioning. According to the ATS, these arrests brought to light the workings of two groups, Rashtriya Jagran Manch and Abhinav Bharat, the latter of which the latest arrests are said to be office bearers.
The director-general of Madhya Pradesh police had on confirmed that Kulkarni was picked up by Maharasthra ATS for questioning from Indore. A Maharashtra police office said that the "Investigations have revealed that Kulkarni is the planner of the Malegaon blast." Having moved to Indore 4 years ago he was said to be in touch with a colonel and a major—both retired. The officer added "He had sought their help on the use of explosives and its procurement. The two retired armymen would be arrested and charged with criminal conspiracy." Accordingly he was said to have hatched the blast in conspiracy with the "sadhvi" and two others, who were arrested in connection with the blast. The Additional Commissioner (ATS), Sukhwinder Singh, said Sameer Kulkarni and Major (retd) Ramesh Upadhyay were part of an alleged "larger conspiracy." without elaborating what the conspiracy, or the basis for it, was. A serving lieutenant colonel in the army also came under the scanner for his alleged role in the blasts. It was reported that the army had allowed police to go ahead and question him. On 31 October more revelations were made as ATS sources said the interrogation of Kulkarni revealed a Bangladeshi link to the terror strike. Kulkarni was believed to have said at least 15 to 20 Bangladeshi nationals were part of "Abhinav Bharat." He has also revealed that the Bangladeshi members were also present in a number of meetings held to hatch the plot, which was planned as retaliation for the Ahmedabad blasts in July 2008. Kulkarni was believed to have started a new social organisation called Abhinav Bharat Sansthan.
On 28 October, the Shiv Sena, in "Saamna", came out in support of the accused saying the arrests were merely political in nature. Lending credence to this, party chief, Uddhav Thackeray, pointed out a potential conflict interest in political rivalry as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) controlled the relevant ministry. His editorial also condemned an attack by NCP party workers on a VHP office in Nashik following the arrest of the "sadhvi". Allegations arose that the "sadhvi" was framed for the blast. Even the firebrand leader of the Bhartiya Janshakti Party, Uma Bharti had expressed shock that the BJP and the broader sangh parivar grouping were "disowning" the "sadhvi", who is alleged to be linked with the Hindu Jagaran Manch. As the polticized wrangling developed, the Hindu Mahasabha decided to provide legal aid to the suspects from Pune — Upadhyay and Kulkarni — while the umbrella organization, Abhinav Bharat, of which the two are members. The national president of the Mahasabha, Himani Savarkar, also based in Pune, confirmed this. This comes following a refusal but the two to hire lawyers when produced before the Nashik court. The broader organization of Hindutva groups were seen to come together when the BJP supported the Shiv Sena's move of extending legal aid to the suspects. The BJP said there was nothing wrong in using "private funds" for "helping" someone. Party spokesperson, Prakash Javadekar, said: "We have no objection to Shiv Sena's announcement of extending legal aid to Malegaon blast suspects. For that matter even RSS has promised help. It is not wrong for private funds to be utilised for helping someone. It is everyone's right." He added that the party's stand is the same from day one, no one should be discriminated on the basis of religion, caste or sex. The politiking behind the investigation picked up as the probe spread to Uttar Pradesh. The ATS claimed a "high profile leader" from the area may be involved in financing the attack. To this end, BJP MP from Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanath, dared the Mumbai ATS to accuse him of being the said leader. The ATS then filed an application in a Mumbai court seeking permission to interrogate the hitherto unnamed person, as well as to obtain the cooperation of the UP government in doing so. The UP ATS, however, denied that its Mumbai counterpart had asked for any assistance in netting the alleged accused. UP CM Mayawati convened her a high-level meeting of her government to discuss the matter. As yet there was mere speculation that the leader may be the firebrand Adityanath, or even his close associate and BJP MLA from the same town, Dr Radha Mohan Das Agrawal. BJP leader, Venkaiah Naidu then came out firing as he said the Maharashtra ATS should speak publicly about the blasts case only when the investigations were complete. He also went and accused the Congress, as the blame game continued, in saying that it was Congress that gave rise to Bhindranwale in Punjab and supported ULFA in Assam. On the same day the BJP parliamentary leader, L. K. Advani also accused the ATS of acting in a politically motivated and unprofessional manner as he alleged that "It has become clear that the ATS is acting in a motivated and unprofessional manner. After going through her (Thakur) affidavit.I have to express my shock and outrage, which I am sure all Indians will share. In view of the shocking charges made against the ATS by the "Sadhvi" ("sic") and the fact that the present investigating team has lost all moral authority, I demand a change in the present ATS team and a judicial inquiry be ordered to probe the charges made by Sadhvi Pragya and the manner in which unsubstantiated allegations have been made against army personnel. After going through her affidavit detailing how she was physically and psychologically tortured and abused in obscene languages by her interrogators, I have to express my shock and outrage. I cannot believe that such barbaric treatment has been meted out to a spiritual person, that too, a woman in a country that prides itself on its democracy and rule of law." A Shiv Sena activist then filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court, in order to see the investigation handed over to the Maharashtra CID, and to see action taken against Anti-Terrorism Squad for "ill treating" "sadhvi" Thakur and botching the handling of the case. In response to the whole imbroglio, the Indian Agriculture Minister and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar described the BJP as "unpatriotic" when he said that "The police have started investigating...If any political party takes objection, it is unfair and unpatriotic. Why should we interfere in the process of investigations?"
The Maharashtra ATS also visited Vadodara, Gujarat as part of their investigations into the attack. Officials of the Special Operation Group (SOG) of the Vadodara police, also a part of the investigation, said the visiting team had specific information about possible links between the Malegaon blast and city.
On 4 November, the case heated up with the arrest of serving Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Shrikant Purohit, who was sent to police custody till 15 November. A court also sanctioned a narco analysis test. In response, the Army's deputy chief, Lt. Gen SPS Dhillon, said that no one will be spared if found guilty, and that action will be taken according to the chargesheet given to them by the ATS. He added that "The arrest of Purohit has dented the image of Army."
He is alleged to have come into contact with Abhinav Bharat or Major Upadhyaya, another armyman, during his postings within Nashik and Pune sometime in 2004-2005. He was found in Panchmarhi, learning Arabic; while call records between him and Upadhyaya around the time of the Malegaon blasts and beyond were said to be incriminating. It later emerged that he, along with the "sadhvi", may be connected to the Samjhauta Express bombings. Indian Defence Minister AK Antony, expressed serious concern over the alleged involvement of a serving Army officer in the attack saying all necessary action would be taken against him by the Defence Ministry on the basis of the investigative report. He said: "This incident is a matter of serious concern for all of us. We are very determined to go to the root of the whole thing. We are awaiting the (Maharashtra police) report (in the case).We will take all necessary action on the basis of the report. On the part of the Army, without any hesitation, they are fully assisting and cooperating with the investigating agencies. We are waiting for a report from the Maharashtra police and I can tell you, we are taking it seriously." As the Army came under fire for allowing the civilian police service to investigate a serving officer, the army came out in strong defence of its record. Facing the possibility of reports of at least three more Army men under scrutiny, the Maharashtra government denied such allegation in going under a damage control exercise. Deputy chief minister, RR Patil, responded to the media allegations in saying, "Please don’t malign the Army. Nor is there an intention to defame the Army." He added that tt was improper to tarnish the reputation of "our Forces" because a "single" "bad" officer had been detected. It was claimed that the ATS jumped to a conclusion in "utter haste without ascertaining the intelligence they have collected about the tainted Army officer who belonged to Intelligence Wing." The ATS counter-contended that they had sought permission from the Army Headquarters to question at least three more officers. The Defense Minister added that "We are waiting for a report, the Army will extend full cooperation. The Intelligence Bureau is investigating it." Among those who could be questioned, based on the interrogation of the retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay, was a Colonel based in Deolali and a Major. To add to the confusion reports also said Purohit had been put under a "Discipline Vigilance" ban where he would not be sacked unless a court of law finds him guilty. Purohit's remand in police custody by a magisterial court was in connection with alleged forgery in procuring a gun from the military, not with the as yet investigate terror case. His defense opposed the prosecutions' plea for a seven-day remand for further investigations, instead saying the ATS was trying to implicate him in a false case by threatening Milind Date. (the alleged supplier of the gun) His counsel further alleged that Purohit, with a distinguished service record in the army, was being victimised for political reasons and that he could even be eliminated by the ATS because of the possession of intelligence data of a sensitive nature pertaining to SIMI and ISI operations, which could embarrass some quarters.
Another major and controversial breakthrough came on 14 November when the ATS arrested the Varanasi-native Dayanand Pandey, alias Sudhakar Dwivedi, who heads the "Sharda Sarvagya Peeth". He was arrested in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh even though his exact role in the blast was not clear. The ATS then planned to go to Jammu to continue investigations of a possible wider net. It was reported that he had visited Jammu as a state guest and got into the high-security Zeesthadevi Temple near "Raj Bhavan". He was apparently said to be in touch with Purohit, who led police to Pandey. Late Hemant Karkare, then chief of ATS investigating the blasts, had said: "We had got some photos, numbers and took help of UP police. He has not yet been arrested but will be if required after interrogation." In addition, another unnamed "sadhvi" was arrested by the Mumbai ATS from Surat on 17 October in connection to the attack.
In January 2009, Indian police were questioning Hindu Rashtra Sene chief Pramod Muthalik over his possible role in the attacks. He has been reportedly been videotaped saying "The Malegaon blast is just a glimpse of what we can do" and implying the bombings were intended to counter "oppression" against Hindus.
NIA, National Investigative Agency, has found no evidence against Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur and it is recommending the court to drop all charges against her. 
Modasa blasts.
Union Textiles Minister, Shankersinh Vaghela, came out with an allgedly scathing attack on the Gujarat government by saying it was not willing to nab the "real" culprits behind the blast even though the Congress MP from Sabarkantha, Madhusudan Mistry, had pointed a finger at probable suspects.
He made the claim that the Gujarat Police had proved itself "useless" while it was heavily politicised in acting only on the orders issued by the Chief Minister’s Office. He based this on the lack of arrests in Modesa, Gujarat, while Maharashtra police had already made arrests in the Malegaon case. With the connection to Hindu suspects in Malegaon, he said he too suspected a similar hand in these blasts. He further alleged, "This proves that terror knows no religion and that it was a matter of concern that so far it was only one sided trend of targeting one community for suspicion and questioning."
In Gujarat, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, K K Mysorewala, who is heading the probe into the attack, said: "We have summoned some active ABVP members to record their statements to take our probe forward." He, however, refused to name those who have been summoned and the reason behind doing so. The Sabarkantha police have recorded statements from about 500-odd people until 28 October 2008. Mysorewala, pointed out that of the 500 people summoned for their statements 200 were associated with Hindutva organizations like the RSS, ABVP, VHP and Bajrang Dal in Modasa. However, there has still been no lead. On 31 October, he exonerated the Malegoan accused from involvement in the Gujarat blasts. He said, "We have interrogated all the five who are currently in the custody of Mumbai police in connection with the Malegaon blast. None of them, however, are involved in the Modasa blast."
On 7 November, it was reported that clues may be emerging. The origin of a readymade Printed Circuit Board (PCB) used in the timer circuit of the bomb may yield greater clues and lead to arrests. Unlike assembled PCBs, the manufacture of a readymade PCB can be tracked with the help of its specific manufacturing design and serial number. Experts in the Physics Department of the Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS) in the Gujarat capital of Gandhinagar say the readymade PCB consists of two Philips Integrated Circuits (ICs), and some capacitors and resistors mounted on a circuit board in a particular order.
An expert involved with the case said that as a result of such moves "We have short-listed the names of some companies that manufacture PCBs of these types. The list had also been handed over to the Sabarkantha police and they are trying to track the final recipient of the PCB under examination. Though this can be a difficult task, it is not impossible."

Marcella Grace Eiler

Marcella "Sali" Grace Eiler (September 30, 1987 – September 15, 2008) was an American social activist from Eugene, Oregon who was raped and murdered in Mexico two weeks before her 21st birthday. For the last three years of her life, she had been living and working intermittently in Oaxaca's provincial capital, Oaxaca de Juárez, as a dance teacher and social activist, and acted as an observer for an indigenous rights organization.
Eiler's body was found on September 24, 2008 near the Oaxaca town of San José del Pacifico, where she had arrived to dance at a fundraiser. Newspapers reported that after Mexico City resident Omar Yoguez Singu admitted that he had killed Eiler with a machete, they beat him and oversaw his delivery into police custody. As of September 26, his case was being administered by Oaxaca's attorney general. Singu is alleged to have raped and murdered Eiler. While Singu confessed to the murder, he said he had had consensual sex with the victim.

John Christensen (baseball)

John Lawrence Christensen (born September 5, 1960) is a former professional baseball outfielder. He played all or part of four seasons in Major League Baseball between 1984 and 1988.
New York Mets.
Christensen was originally drafted by the California Angels out of Troy High School in Fullerton, California in the 16th round of the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft, but elected instead to attend California State University. The New York Mets then selected him in the second round of the 1981 Major League Baseball Draft. After batting .313 at Triple-A Tidewater in 1984, he debuted with the Mets as a September call-up, batting .273 with three runs batted in and two runs scored with the big league club.
Two blockbuster trades.
Christensen's numbers tailed off considerably in 1985; he batted only .212 with the Tidewater Tides, and .186 with the Mets. Following the season, the Mets traded Christensen to the Boston Red Sox along with Calvin Schiraldi, Wes Gardner and La Schelle Tarver for Bob Ojeda, Tom McCarthy, John Mitchell and Chris Bayer. After spending all of 1986 with the International League's Pawtucket Red Sox, he was sent as the player to be named later in the deal that netted Boston Dave Henderson and Spike Owen from the Seattle Mariners.
Seattle Mariners.
Christensen batted .385 for Seattle's double A Southern League affiliate, the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1987. However, it did not translate to major league success for him as he batted only .242 in 53 games for the M's. He was again batting .300 in the minor leagues when the Mariners released him on May 23, 1988.
Minnesota Twins.
On May 28, Christensen joined the Minnesota Twins. He split the remainder of the season between the Twins, where he batted .263 in 23 games, and their top farm club, the Portland Beavers. He was released at the end of the season, but re-signed to a minor league contract. He returned to Portland, where he batted .270 in 127 games in 1989, his final professional season.

Weights and Measures Act (R.S. 1985)

Weights and Measures Act (R.S. 1985) is a Canadian law governing the units of measurements used in Canada.
Originally passed in 1970 as part of the federal government's plan for metrication of Canada from Imperial measures, it was stopped in 1985 and changes were made to the Act. The Metric Commission was created by the Act and abolished in 1985.
The act sets forth the regulation of measurements and the commerce conducted using measuring devices. The act provides that the International System of measurement be used with what the act calls "Customary units used with the international system" such as hour, minutes, litres, hectares, tonne or metric ton.
In addition, the act allows usage of what the act labels as "Canadian units" (the imperial system), such as miles, inches, imperial gallons, and acres. In SCHEDULE III - section 5, the act also provides for the usage of certain French units in what it labels as "UNITS OF MEASUREMENT TO DESCRIBE CERTAIN LAND IN QUEBEC". The five permitted old French units are the foot (the French foot of 12.789 inches), arpent (for both length and area), and perch (for both length and area).

One Droopy Knight

One Droopy Knight is a 1957 animated short subject in the "Droopy" series, directed by Michael Lah and produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in CinemaScope as well.
Plot.
Essentially a remake of 1949's "Señor Droopy", but taking in a medieval setting rather than the country of Mexico, "One Droopy Knight" casts Droopy and his rival Spike as medieval knights out to slay a dragon and win the hand of a beautiful human princess. However, the dragon considers both as nothing more than minor nuisances. Droopy though, takes more chances to slay the dragon, but it thinks Droopy is small and harmless. Meanwhile, Spike is being foiled after being molded into a metal can.
Droopy however, bangs a flail on the dragon's tail and says,"Take that you no good dragon!" Once again the dragon single-handedly flicks Droopy away. Spike comes back riding on a steed. Suddenly, the dragon blows fire on Spike and the horse, leaving them naked.
Spike gives up and goes away, while Droopy stands and cries looking at a picture of the princess. The dragon draws a French moustache on the photo and laughs outrageously. Droopy calmly gets mad and says one of his catchphrases,"You know what? That makes me mad." Then he beats up the dragon and wins the heart of the princess. Finally, at the palace, Droopy reads the ending of the story of the dragon and closes the book. He kisses the princess's hand, then takes up a cigar to show her about smoking, and Droopy gives the cigar a blow, the dragon comes up, and breathes fire on it. The result is smoke coming out from the cigar when Droopy smokes it before revealing this to the princess.
Reception.
In 1958, producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were nominated for an Academy Award for "Best Animated Short" for "One Droopy Knight", but lost for "Birds Anonymous", a Sylvester & Tweety cartoon from Warner Bros..

The Thomas-Morse MB-6 was an American racing aircraft built by Thomas-Morse Aircraft for the US Army Air Service.
Development and design.
After a Thomas-Morse MB-3 finished second at the 1920 Pulitzer Trophy air race, the Army asked Thomas-Morse to build a new aircraft for the 1921 race. On 21 May 1921 they ordered three aircraft for $48,000 each. The MB-6 was a redesigned MB-3, with a reduced wingspan and Wright H-2 engine. The three aircraft arrived for testing at McCook Field on 20 September 1921. The first one was for ground testing, the second one first flew on 21 October 1921. The third MB-6 crashed during a landing and was destroyed.
Operational history.
The MB-6 competed in the 1921 Pulitzer Trophy. Piloted by Lt. J.A. Mccready, it came in third behind two Curtiss aircraft, with a speed of 160.71 mph (258.64 km/h). The aircraft was given the military designation "R-2" in 1922 and scrapped on 31 October 1924.

False Kiva

False Kiva is a human-made stone circle of unknown origin in a cave in a remote area of the Canyonlands National Park, which is located in U.S. state of Utah. It requires some hiking knowledge or special directions to find.
It has become a popular spot for photographers capturing the Southwest, offering a unique frame for the dramatic thunderstorms or clear skies beyond.
Origin.
While located in a naturally occurring cave, the name "False Kiva" arises from the uncertainty around the circle of stones' origins and purpose, not whether it is really an authentic kiva.
Disclosure controversy.
Debate rages on whether to disclose the exact location of False Kiva as it enjoys a semi-protected status. While park rangers are required to disclose the location of the Class II site, it does not appear on official maps of the park. Because of the remoteness of the location, the site itself is not protected from vandalism of any kind.
However, local guides are available to take interested parties to the site, raising questions as to whether closely guarding the location of False Kiva is particularly effective.
The exact coordinates for False Kiva are occasionally divulged on forums, but GPS users should be aware that these exact directions can place hikers 500 feet directly above False Kiva on the rim of the canyon. The trailhead to False Kiva is not marked or signed from park roads, but the route itself is marked by cairns in several locations, and can be accessed without technical climbing equipment. 
Art.
A photograph of False Kiva by Wally Pacholka, entitled "A True Image of False Kiva," was featured on NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) on September 29, 2008, giving an almost otherworldly view into the Milky Way.

Jeogori

The jeogori ( ;) is a basic upper garment of hanbok, Korean traditional garment, which has been worn by both men and women. It covers the arms and upper part of the wearer's body.
Etymology.
The "jeogori" has been worn since ancient times, and went by various names such as "yu" (유, 襦), "boksam" (복삼, 複杉), "uihae" (위해, 尉解) in the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC - 668 AD). Although it is unknown when the term, "jeogori" began to be used to refer the garment, it is assumed to have appeared in the late Goryeo period around King Chungnyeol's reign. The first historical document to mention the "jeogori" is "Cheongjeonui" (천전의, ) for Queen Wongyeong (원경왕후), which was a funeral ceremony for carrying the coffin out of the palace. The document written in 1420 during the second reign of Sejong the Great records "jeokgori" () and "danjeokgori" (). However, there is no certainty whether the record is a hanja (Chinese character) transliteration of a Korean word or Mongolian influence. Before the Goryeo period, such an upper garment was referred to as "uihae" (위해, 尉解) in Silla. As the uihae was a transliteration of the Silla language, dialects such as "uti" and "uchi" still remain to present.
Composition.
The basic form of a "Jeogori" consists of "gil", "git", "dongjeong", "goreum" and sleeves "somae". "Gil" (길) is the large section of the garment in both front and back side and "git" (깃) is a band of fabric that trims the collar. "Dongjeong" (동정) is a removable white collar placed over the end of the "git" and is generally squared off. The "goreum" (고름) are coat strings attached to the breast part to tie the "jeogori". Women's "jeogori" may have "kkeutdong" (끝동), a different colored cuff placed on the end of the sleeves. The form of "jeogri" has been changed as time goes by.
There are several types of "jeogori" according to fabric, sewing technique, and shape.

SAM 935

SAM 935 is a portable radiation detection and identification device. It uses gamma spectroscopy with room temperature NaI detectors, and QCC, Quadratic Compression Conversion, algorithms to identify multiple isotopes in realtime and below background (it subtracts the background). The SAM, surveillance and monitoring, is able to capture even transient phenomenon such as in portal situations because it captures spectra in short time segments and produces a response from spectra with each time segment. Conversely, if the SAM is in a moving vehicle, it can quickly scan an area as the vehicle moves. The first line responder can email the SAM 935 data report for further analysis.
An upgrade to the SAM 935, the SAM 940, uses a LaBr3 detector that has better resolution than a NaI detector. Additionally, the SAM 940 offers one-hand operation and a better display. An advantage of LaBr is clearly seeing the gamma and x- ray peaks of plutonium. The one highly penetrating NaI peak of Pu239 is now clearly separated into three easily recognized peaks with LaBr . The first line responder can email the SAM 940 data report (complete with GPS data, ANSI N42.42 compliant) for further analysis.
References.
The SAM 935 and SAM 940 are a pair of instruments utilized to search, detect, identify, and quantify gamma radiation. These instruments are typically utilized in the field; however, some emergency response agencies incorporate these and other instruments into emergency response vehicles designed to monitor events such as the Super Bowl, World Series, and political conventions.
Typically, the users of the equipment are trained, educated, and highly specialized operatives from the City, State, or Federal Agencies. The equipment is monitored, evaluated, and calibrated monthly when necessary. It is common for agencies such as fire, and police agencies to create job aids when training current employees, or placing the equipment under new ownership as department duties change.

Cherokee Christian Schools is a private Christian school in Woodstock, Georgia, United States enrolling students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Its primary organization includes the Academy (kindergarten, elementary, and middle) and the High School. The Administration of CCS includes a Board of Directors, a Superintendent, and respective principal of elementary, middle school and high school. It is a traditional school in that students attend 5 days a week and follow a period schedule and calendar similar to local public schools.
The school was originally established in 1986 under the auspices of the session of Cherokee Presbyterian Church (PCA) in an effort to establish a Biblical alternative to secular, public schooling utilizing a traditional education model. As the school grew, grade-levels were added yearly until, in 1997 it added the 12th grade and saw the first graduating class. For financial reasons, the high school was terminated two years later, followed by a hiatus of 9 years, but has since been re-established and is now in separate high school facilities on another part of the campus.
When the school outgrew the initial facilities also housing Cherokee Presbyterian Church facilities, the school relocated to its current site at 3075 Trickum Road, Woodstock Georgia. The school's facilities have progressively expanded so as to now include an elementary building, with a fine-arts wing and a middle-school wing, a separate high school building, and athletic fields. The school recently acquired an adjacent property, nearly doubling the available campus acreage, with long-range plans to include a separate fine-arts building.

Benton Harbor Public Library

The Benton Harbor Public Library (BHPL) is a public library located in Benton Harbor, Michigan. The BHPL service area consists of the City of Benton Harbor and Benton Charter Township, Michigan.
The library has an extensive reference department; a book collection of approximately 100,000 books; an auditorium for group activities; free notary public service; and offers free wireless internet access via WiFi hotspot.
BHPL is a member of the Southwestern Michigan Library Cooperative. BHPL also participates in the statewide MichiCard library card program.
History.
The beginning.
The first attempt to start a library in Benton Harbor took place in 1880, when an old Englishman named Alfred Coats decided the city needed a library. He made room for a collection of 200 books in his photographic studio, located above Hopkins' (later Peck's) Drug Store at the corner of Main and Water streets. A sign hung outside his studio proclaiming, "Alfred Coats, Librarian."
When Coats moved his studio, the books were moved to the office of well-known Twin Cities physician, H. V. Tutton (founder of Mercy Hospital). According to later newspaper accounts, interested people then decided the library related to schoolchildren, and so the collection moved to the office of the Superintendent of Schools. In 1892 when the new high school was built, the library was moved into it. The library came to an abrupt end when fire gutted the school in 1898.
New library building opened.
The next attempt at forming a library actually started in 1898, when a group of ministers met and discussed the feasibility of starting a library for the "betterment of the community." They presented their request to the City Commission and on Jan. 2, 1899, the commission passed an ordinance creating the mechanism for establishing the library. In the spring of that year, the commission appropriated $1,500 for the public library.
In September 1900, the library opened in Room 12, located over a drug store at the corner of Pipestone and Main streets. Miss Louise Huntington Bailey was hired as the first librarian. Use of the library by children was so brisk, the city in 1901 hired Mrs. Emma Hinkley Cole as assistant librarian.
At about this time, the Carnegie Foundation was helping to establish public libraries throughout the United States as part of Andrew Carnegie's desire to upgrade education and the quality of life for the public. The library board secretary in 1902 solicited funds from the foundation, which eventually contributed $20,000 to build a public library building.
The fan-shaped building officially opened Aug. 4, 1903, with great fanfare. Fred Null's orchestra played and speeches were made. "The library is a dream in architectural beauty and a model in interior arrangement," according to a newspaper article recounting the affair. The new library was located at the foot of Brunson Hill, at the intersection of Sixth and Wall streets, opposite Bell's Opera House. One of the noted highlights of the building was that it had running water throughout. When it opened, the library had 3,500 books on the shelves.
Controversy and accidents.
Even a decorous institution such as the public library has moments of controversy and excitement.
In 1923, head librarian Theodosia Falkingham "on behalf of the women patrons" requested that the city remove the park seats outside the library because that area had become "a paradise for tobacco spitting loafers and a convenient place for alcoholic imbibing gentry to sleep off their jags." Also, "painted ladies" plied their trade in the area. The city complied with the request and a citizen composed a poem about the event.
In 1924, Falkingham went before the City Commission to complain that the library only received $3,500 in financial support from the city, as opposed to $5,000 for the parks. She pointed out the library now had 9,000 books and a circulation of more than 60,000. This led to public approval of a millage to support the library.
In 1928, a Hupmobile sedan parked on Brunson Hill went amok. The brake released and the car plunged down the hill and through a basement window in the library. No one was in the car or the library at the time, but the car was found in a vertical position, rear end up, on the Children's Room floor.
It was "deja vu all over again" when a car again hit the building, and the flagpole, in 1951.
Expansion of service.
The library responded to the community and the changing times over the years. A book drive for soldiers was conducted in 1942 to send books to soldiers serving in World War II. A book collection for "war time guidance" was created to help those on the home front deal with every day problems, such as rationing. Also that year, the library established a branch at Mercy Hospital to bring books and other materials to patients.
Benton Township in 1963 contracted with the city for library service, discontinuing its own small library and arranging for bookmobile service. Then plans were made in the early and mid-1960s to build a new library building. Construction began in 1966 during the tenure of Library Director Eleanor Whitney, and the new building was dedicated in 1968. A feature of the new library was a 2.5-ton statue depicting the mythological Icarus, which was donated by the Arthur Sidney Mendel Foundation. The statue was put in place while construction was going on, and the building was finished around it. The statue was rededicated in 1991 to honor longtime board member Dave Goldbaum, who served on the board from 1952 until his death in 1990.
One casualty did occur—a wall of the old library collapsed during construction, forcing some of the library services to move into the old News Palladium building on Wall Street. The old library eventually was demolished, a victim of "urban renewal."
A new era of library service began with the move to the new building. A new bookmobile was purchased in 1978. A high-tech microfilm reader-printer was given to the library by the B'nai B'rith Lodge in 1970. Several neighborhood libraries were established under the Model Cities Program (no longer in existence). Art work was added to the circulating collection. The Israelite House of David research room was opened. The library offered rental of videodiscs, and later videotapes. A computer terminal with internet access was made available to the public in 1997. That same year, the Benton Harbor Lions Club Foundation paid for half of a new $14,000 microfilm reader printer.
Court case.
In a significant move in 1979, the library board filed suit against the city in Berrien County Circuit Court. At issue was the question of who had authority over the library, the city or the library board. Circuit Court Judge Zoe Burkholz ruled in favor of the library board, a decision which was upheld by the state Court of Appeals in 1980.

Governance.
Wyalusing Area School District is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills.
The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration an "F" for transparency based on a review of "What information can people find on their school district's website". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more.
Academic achievement.
Wyalusing Area School District was ranked 302nd out of 498 Pennsylvania school districts by the Pittsburgh Business Times in 2013. The ranking was based on student academic achievement as demonstrated on the last three years of the PSSAs for: reading, writing math and science. The PSSAs are given to all children in grades 3rd through 8th and the 11th grade in high school. Adapted examinations are given to children in the special education programs.
In 2012, the "Pittsburgh Business Times" also reported an Overachievers Ranking for 498 Pennsylvania school districts. Wyalusing Area School District ranked 315th. The editor describes the ranking as: "a ranking answers the question - which school districts do better than expectations based upon economics? This rank takes the Honor Roll rank and adds the percentage of students in the district eligible for free and reduced-price lunch into the formula. A district finishing high on this rank is smashing expectations, and any district above the median point is exceeding expectations."
US News and World Report ranking In 2012, Wyalusing Area Junior Senior High School was recognized by US News and World Report as a Bronze level high school in a nation wide school ranking. The study was conducted by American Institutes for Research which examined how many students attained performance levels that exceed statistical expectations given the school's relative level of student poverty, as measured by state accountability test scores for all the school's students in the core subjects of reading and math. The study also examined the success rate for the school's least advantaged student groups (e.g., black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students) that exceed state averages. The study included 752 high schools in Pennsylvania, including traditional public schools, public charter schools and public magnet schools. In Pennsylvania, 136 public high schools achieved a Bronze rating in 2012; 49 achieved a silver rating and 7 received a gold rating. The highest ranking went to Julia R. Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School in the School District of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.

Science in Motion Wyalusing Junior Senior High School does not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate. Wilkes University provides the enrichment experiences to schools in the region.
College remediation rate.
According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 11% of the Wyalusing Junior Senior High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.
Dual enrollment.
Wyalusing Junior Senior High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate at Keystone College. For several years, the state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, Wyalusing Area School District received a state grant of $8,3574 for the program. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are homeschooled are eligible to participate in this program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis.

The Wyalusing Area School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 24 credits to graduate, including: Mathematics 4 credits, English 4 credits, social studies 4 credits, science 4 credits, Computer .33 credit, Physical Education, Health, Drivers ED 2.67 credits and electives 5 credits.
By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.
By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam, with those who do not able to perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements. In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP.
Seventh and eighth grade.
8th Grade Reading
Elementary school.
Wyalusing Valley Elementary School was formed in 2012 from the consolidation of the District's four elementary schools. A faculty realignment was part of the process. The new school provides grades kindergarten through 6th grade. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 100% of its teachers were rated "Highly Qualified" under No Child Left Behind. Wyalsuing Area School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2003.
In 2012, Wyalusing Valley Elementary School was in Warning AYP status due to lagging achievement in reading and mathematics.
Special education.
In December 2011, Wyalusing Area School District administration reported that 210 pupils or 14.9% of the District's pupils received Special Education services, with 55.2% having specific learning disabilities. In December 2010, the District Administration reported that 195 pupils or 13.5% of the district's pupils received Special Education services
Wyalusing Area School District received a $848,054 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12, 2012–13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.
In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district’s students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student’s needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.
Gifted education.
The Wyalusing Area School District Administration reported that 22 or 1.53% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing to the administration. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Once a students is designated as gifted in one school district, that must be honored by all Pennsylvania public school districts and charter schools should the student move.
Budget.
Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1.
Under Pennsylvania’s Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.

According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers’ total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security.
Audit In June 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the School Board and the District’s administration.
Per pupil spending In 2008, Wyalusing Area School District administration reported that per pupil spending was $$12,076 which ranked 220th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010 the per pupil spending had increased to $13,393.29 Among the states, Pennsylvania’s total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year year 2000-01.
Wyalusing Area School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $615.69 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007-08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union.
Reserves In 2008, the Wyalusing Area School District reported a balance of zero in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $3,170,464. In 2010, Wyalusing Area Administration reported an increase to $3,697,213 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.
Wyalusing Area School District faces a challenge in the rapidly rising costs of teachers' pensions. The Administration reports the payment is expected to rise dramatically by 2015. District's mandated pension contribution FY 2009-10, $573,000; FY 2010-11, $616,000; FY 2011/12, $950,000; FY 2012-13, $2.6 million; FY 2013-14, $2.9 million; FY 2014-15, $3 million. The pension payment will consume a large part of the budget necessitating reductions in other areas. The amount school districts contribute to the PSERS )Pennsylvania School Employees Retirement System) is mandated by the state. Overstaffing by retaining teachers even as enrollment declines has exacerbated the pension crisis across the Commonwealth.
The District administration and School Board spend over $20,000 annually to belong to a variety of organizations, including Pennsylvania School Board Association, Pennsylvania Association for Rural and Small Schools ($940 per year), Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators (PASA) and PASBO - Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials.
Tuition Students who live in the Wyalusing Area School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Wyalusing Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Wyalusing Area School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,820.27, High School -. $9,637.55

Wyalusing Area School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 1.44%, Per capita taxes $10, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual’s personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools.

One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell’s policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others.

Accountability Block Grants.
Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania’s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $259,690 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for over 100 pupils.
In 2011-12 and 2012 13 the District received $95,676.
Other grants.
The District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell), Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants.
Federal Stimulus grant.
Wyalusing Area School District received an extra $2,263,612 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.
Race to the Top grant.
Wyalusing Area School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly $1 million in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.
Common Cents state initiative.
Wyalusing Area School Board elected to participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. In April 2009, the Board approved all the recommendations received from the Common Cents Shared Services Initiative.
Real estate taxes.
Wyalusing Area School Board set the millage for real estate for Bradford County at 39.6533 mills and Wyoming County at 55.7552 mills for the 2012-13. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.
The average yearly property tax paid by Bradford County residents amounts to about 3.06% of their yearly income. Bradford County ranked 365th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income. In Wyoming County, residents pay 3.73% of their income in property taxes ranking 304th in the USA. According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).
Act 1 Adjusted Index.
The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school’s share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
The School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.
For the 2013-14 budget year, Wyalusing Area School Board applied for an exception to exceed their Act 1 Index limit due to School Construction
Grandfathered Debt. The board was approved by the PDE to exceed the tax limit. For the school budget year 2013-14, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index. Another 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed their tax limit. For the pension costs exception, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven Pennsylvania public school districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.
For the 2012-13 budget year, Wyalusing Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.
For the 2011-12 school year, Wyalusing Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, Wyalusing Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.
Wyalusing Area School Board applied for several exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2010-2011, including rising teacher pension costs, School Construction Grandfathered Debt and School Construction Academic Project. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards sought to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.
Property tax relief.
In 2012, Wyalusing Area School District approved homestead residents received $126. In 2010, property tax relief for 2,357 approved residents of Wyalusing Area School District was set at $130. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Wyalusing Area School District was also $127 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,330 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Bradford County, the highest tax relief went to Sayre Area School District which was set at $342. The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 62% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.
Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million. The program is funded by the Pennsylvania Lottery. Property tax rebates are increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.
Extracurriculars.
The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy.
By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

<doc id="19528635" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19528635" title="Price discovery">
Price discovery

The price discovery process (also called price discovery mechanism) is the process of determining the price of an asset in the marketplace through the interactions of buyers and sellers.
Price discovery is different from valuation. Price discovery process involves buyers and sellers arriving at a transaction price for a specific item at a given time. It involves the following:
"Market" is broad term that covers buyers, sellers and even sentiment. For price discovery it is useful to think of the "Execution Venue" a single market will have one or more execution venue. The Execution venue is where the trades are made: Executed. This execution venue could be in the street for a street market, or it could be an electronic venue: A virtual Execution Venue. Increasingly Virtual Execution Venues are used. Examples include NASDAQ, The London Metal Exchange, NYSE, London Stock Exchanges. Despite the differences in implementation all Execution Venues are the location where price discovery takes place.
Post ENRON accounting rules changed and companies had to "mark to market" this means that only recently discovered prices could be used. The intention of this change was to stop companies overvaluing the assets they held as each night (or reporting period) they would have to take a recently discovered market price obtained from 2 or more market observers.
Recent changing in market regulations, post Lehman Bros, have outlined practices that effect the price discovery mechanism. Price discovery is sensitive to many factors. Consider for a specific execution venue the following inputs drive the price discovery mechanism.
The cost of execution applies to all markets, even a street market trader may have to pay to have a stall, or invest time walking to a village market. These are not costs of production but a cost incurred to access the execution venue.
Remember that price discovery is a summation of the total market's sentiment at a point in time: A multifaceted, aggregate view on the future. A multi-faceted, aggregate view on the future It is how every price in every market is determined. The market price is important as it is a factor in the pricing at off market execution venues and direct and indirect derived products. For example the price of Oil has a direct bearing on the cost of tomatoes in cold climates.
Market rules set the times and duration for trades and settlement. Some markets may not have many participants as the assets being traded do not have much appeal (the formal term is market interest - As participants express interest in the underlying asset. Such markets are often called illiquid. Examples might include minor currencies. In illiquid markets price discovery might take place at a predefined auction time or even whenever participant wants to trade. In such cases there may be no executions for days or months. In such examples there is no price discovery for long periods so the last traded price is used. This can have significant risk as the market for the illiquid may have moved. Another characteristic of liquid markets is that the cost of trading can be higher due to the lack of competition.
In a dynamic market, the price discovery takes place continuously while items are bought and sold. The price will sometimes fall below the duration average and sometimes exceed the average as a result of the noise due to uncertainties, and transient changes in supply caused by the act of buying and selling: trading. A closed market has no price discovery the last trade price is all that is known. It is common in some markets not to use the actual last traded price but some sort of average / weighted mean. This is to prevent price manipulation by the execution of outliers on or at market close. One side effect of this practices is that market close prices are not always available at market close, indeed even after the official market close is published, it is possible for "corrections" to be issued later still.
Many derivative contracts are based on "fixings" price snaps are point in time when the market is open. 4pm is a typical fixing time for some end of day derivative contracts that need access to a price on a specific day where the end of day prices is not used. This is important as is shows the uncertainty that is created when price discovery stops, we are forced to use "official market close" or "last traded" prices which are normally published by the Exchanges hosting the execution venues.
Usually, price discovery helps find the exact price for a commodity or a share of a company. The price discovery is used in speculative markets which affects traders, manufacturers, exporters, farmers, oil well owners, refineries, governments, consumers, and speculators.

Anorak in the UK

Anorak in the UK is a live album by Marillion released in April 2002 and documenting the previous year's "Anoraknophobia" tour. Most songs were recorded on three nights in May 2001 (Manchester Academy, May 19, Wolverhampton Civic Hall, May 20, London Forum, May 22) using a mobile studio, while two tracks ("When I Meet God" and "This is the 21st Century") were recorded in front of a small private audience at the band's own studio after the October leg of the tour.
The album was released in two versions: A two-disc set only distributed via Marillion's own mail-order business, and a one-disc retail edition distributed by EMI. Under this deal, EMI required the band to provide one exclusive song on the retail edition that would not be found on the two-disc version. The band chose "Easter" from 1989, as it is available on several previous official and semi-official live albums and therefore would not "force" fans to purchase both versions of the album. "Anorak in the UK" is Marillion's first official retail live album since "Made Again" (1996), and the second with Steve Hogarth. The title takes its cues from the Sex Pistols single "Anarchy in the U.K." and, self-mockingly, the British slang term anorak (a person with unfathomable interest in arcane, detailed information regarded as boring by the rest of the population) often applied to Marillion fans. The cover shows a crowd consisting of "Barry" featured on "Anoraknophobia".

This event was the third-heaviest of the men's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 90 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage.

British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association

The British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association (BBS & BGS Association; also known as The Brotherhood of British Scouts) is an early Scouting organisation, having begun as the Battersea Boy Scouts in 1908. The organization was renamed as the British Boy Scouts and launched as a national organization on 24 May 1909. In association with other scout organizations, the BBS formed the National Peace Scouts in 1910. The BBS instigated the first international Scouting organization, the Order of World Scouts in 1911.
History.
British Boy Scouts.
In 1909, Battersea Scout District withdrew from Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts Association and formed the British Boy Scouts (BBS), out of a concern that Baden-Powell's association was too bureaucratic and militaristic. Initially, the BBS was led by Major W.G. Whitby as Chief Commissioner and as financier. Assisting were Colonel Frederick Charles Keyser, President BBS and H. Moore secretary of the Battersea Scouts. The BBS was launched on Empire Day, 24 May 1909.
The BBS was given publicity by Cassell and Company publisher of CHUMS publication, who had previously developed their own league of 'CHUMS league of Scouts' with the CHUMS Scout Patrols. They were formed by the readers of the CHUMS boy's newspaper, in response to an invite from the Editor for boys to form their own patrols. Cassell merged their Patrols with the BBS and allowed them to publish a weekly page June 1909 until mid-1911.
CHUMS "On the Watch Tower" news column reported on 11 September 1907 that Robert Baden-Powell's Brownsea Island Scouting encampment was proposed and his recommendation that Boy Scout groups should be formed. Readers were interested in forming Scouting groups and the editorial staff initially supported this move, indicating that Baden-Powell would be consulted. The CHUMS Scouts would wear the 'Chums' League badge. The CHUMS newspaper was distributed throughout the British Empire and CHUMS Scout Patrols formed in both the UK and Australia 1908. Due to Baden-Powell's arrangement with his publisher, Pearson, CHUMS was denied the rights to publish the Scout scheme in what was a rival paper. Later, CHUMS indicated that there would be a CHUMS Legion of Scouts formed from the CHUMS Scout Patrols to be announced later. Instead CHUMS announced the launch of British Boy Scouts (BBS) and that it would be the official BBS journal in May 1909.
From the beginning in 1909, the BBS had a 10 part Law, whereas the Boy Scouts Association Law, only had nine clauses, the tenth being added in 1911 at the suggestion of the Reverend Dr A T Scholfield.
Sir Francis Vane was the Boy Scouting Association's (BSA) London Commissioner. He believed that Scouting should be non-military and through mediation, reconciled the British Boy Scouts(BBS) with the B-P Association, by having BBS as an affiliated organisation. With Vane pushing for a more democratic BSA, his position was eliminated by Baden-Powell's BSA headquarter staff. In a protest meeting, the London area Scoutmasters voted overwhelming in support of Sir Francis Vane. However Baden-Powell, even though he promised to do so, never reinstated Vane. Members of the National Service League, a pro-military group, were appointed to BSA headquarters. On 3 December 1909, he accepted the presidency of the British Boy Scouts taking most London area Troops with him. The Quakers' Birmingham and Midland Troops also followed as Vane was a key influence in getting the Quakers to sponsor Scout Troops.
With the spread of the alternative British Boy Scouts program throughout the world via the CHUMS publication and Vane's efforts, Vane informally aligned the various groups as the Legion of World Scouts, the first international organization. In 1911 this was formally launched as the Order of World Scouts (OWS).
By mid-1911, the original organisers had resigned from the BBS, losing the organisation sponsorship from CHUMS. Vane put his wealth behind the organisation, providing a London headquarters and financed the organisation, including the manufacture of BBS uniforms. This overburdened his finances to the point of him declaring bankruptcy. Thus the British Boy Scouts and the Order of World Scouts lost their headquarters, source of equipment and uniforms and their leader, Sir Francis Vane. By the end of 1912 Captain Masterman, then Assistant Grand Scoutmaster - Britain, led Troops and Junior Troops in joining the Boy Scouting Association while in 1913 some troops were led by Mr. Barrow Cadbury to join the Boys' Life Brigade (BLB), becoming the BLB Scouts. This left about 100 Troops under the new Grand Scoutmaster, Albert Jones Knighton. Vane kept in contact, and in 1915, home from leave from his duties for the Army in Ireland, inspected a Troop under London Commissioner, Mr Percy Herbert Pooley. Under Knighton and Pooley, the BBS & BGS became a definite Christian association.
The UK Parliament had a bill in 1921 before it to restrict use of "Boy Scout" and Scout uniform and Badges to the Boy Scouts Association but the measure failed. In 1926, a broader bill to protect all Chartered Associations was passed but with a clause by Herbert Dunnico, a Labour MP and a BBS Scoutmaster, that exempted any 'bona fide national organisation' from the act, such as the British Boy Scouts. Knighton had resigned without waiting for the outcome of the legislation and formed "the British Boy Sentinels", a non-scouting organization. Pooley took over as Chief Commissioner with Rt Hon. Lord Alington as Grand Scoutmaster. Some Boy Scouts Association Troops from Shoreditch, East Ham and Lewisham allied with the BBS until 1932 forming 'The Independent Scout Alliance'. Some BLB Companies affiliated with the BBS as the 'Young Life Pioneers' when in 1926 the Life Brigade merged with the Boys' Brigade. Sir Francis in vain tried to reconcile the BBS with the BSA after returning from Italy in 1927. This initiative failed due to a lack of a positive response from the B-P HQ. They required the BBS to disband, and Troops and individuals apply in the normal way - without any reassurance as to the acceptance of units.
Brotherhood of British Scouts.
The Young Life Pioneers by 1930's either joined the Boys' Brigade or became BBS Troops. About 40 Troops existed in the 1930s mostly sponsored by Free Churches. With reduced membership and lacking a Parliamentarian supporter, the Boy Scout Association used the "The Chartered Associations (Protection of Names and Uniforms) Act" to stop the BBS from using the term "Boy Scouts" which prompted a change in name to "The Brotherhood of British Scouts" to avoid any further legal action. In response some Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire Troops under the Assistant Chief Commissioner W. Hanley broke off from the main group using "British Boy Scouts" for about a year, only to return.
The World War II's call up of Scoutmasters and youth evacuations reduced the BBS to 8 Troops. This decrease continued into the 1950s when only 6 Troops existed; 1st Lewisham (St Stephen's) Loampit Hill (under Charles A Brown, Assistant Chief Commissioner), 1st Wimbledon (Samuel Manning, Grand Scoutmaster) 1st Cirencester (Pooley, Chief Commissioner), 1st Stroud (Pooley, Chief Commissioner), 1st Beckingham, and 1st Huddersfield. By 1971, Brown was Chief Commissioner and led the lone BBS Troop in Lewisham, South London.
British Boy Scouts (1979-).
The St Stephens House Rover Crew in Oxford, led by Michael Foster, joined the BBS in 1979. The Oxford Rover Crew became officially "The Oxford University Rover Crew", With members leaving Oxford and settling elsewhere, this resulted in additional BBS groups in the 1980s. In 1983, the Reverend Michael Foster (who by that time was a Parish Priest in the Church of England, Vicar of Holy Trinity Clifton, Nottingham) was appointed Chief Commissioner by Charles Brown, who went on to become Grand Scoutmaster. Other groups joined up with the British Boy Scouts: in 1985, 1st Waltham Forest, an Independent Scout Group, and in 1988 the Outlanders association. Several Troops which left the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association joined up with the BBS in 1990s.
The re-expansion of the Order of World Scouts began in the early 1980s with membership in the USA State of Hawaii, and then in 1990s with appointments of a BBS Commissioner for Australia in 1991 and a Chief Commissioner of BBS & BGS in Canada in 1999.
In January 1993, Ted Scott, a friend of Pooley and long time BBS member, became the Grand Scoutmaster following the death of Charles Brown in November 1992 and served seven years becoming the first Grand Scout Emeritus when Dr Michael Foster replaced him, Ted died after being ill on 3 March 2009, after serving 83 years in the BBS. David Cooksley replaced Dr Michael Foster as the Chief Commissioner.
British Girl Scouts.
Girls Scouts were a part of the British Boy Scouts from the start. With a public outcry over girls in the Scouts, the British Boy Scouts launched the British Girl's Nursing Corps (BGNC) under a Scout mistress reporting to the BBS executive and becoming a separate organisation with a journal ("The British Girl Nurse") in June 1910. Vane however had other ideas and allowed girls to continue as Girl Scouts and brought whole Troops of girls with him from The Boy Scout Association. Many Girls Scouts did not wish to become Guides under the BSA scheme. Both the British Girls Scouts and the British Girl's Nursing Corps became members of the Order of World Scouts. The latter was disassociated from the British Boy Scouts and the British Girls Scouts remain as their counterpart.
British Boy Scouts in Australia.
Chums Scout Patrols started forming in 1908 in Australia due to the circulation there of the Chums publication for boys. Troops under the British Boy Scouts (BBS) program began operations in 1909. In 1910, Chums Scout Patrols merged with the BBS. Australia activities continued until the 1930s while members continued to exist in the organization. The Independent Australian Scouts, a new organization was found in 1986 and became affiliate and successor to British Boy Scouts in Australia. Several Scoutmasters joined the BBS from The Boy Scouts Association Queensland Branch with an attempt at reconciliation in 1911. A single Brisbane troop existed there until after 1921.
British Boy Scouts in South Africa.
E. P. Carter turned his Boys Guides' Brigade, founded in 1902 into the South African (SA) British Boy Scouts (BBS). The Boys Guide Brigade was found by Carter in 1902. With the turmoil after 1912, the SA BBS rebuffed Baden-Powell's effort to have them join The Boy Scout Association instead renaming themselves Naval Cadets.
Elsewhere.
The British Boy Scouts were also organized in Canada, New Zealand, India, Creillos, South America and Egypt. All of these were original members of the Order of World Scouts. Most lost most or all of their members during the First World War.
Chums Scout Patrols.
Chums Scout Patrols (also Chums Legion of Scouts or Chums League of Scouts), were an early organisation of Scouting in the United Kingdom. It was formed by the readers of the Chums boy's newspaper, in response to an invite from the Editor for boys to form their own patrols.
History.
Chums "On the Watch Tower" news column reported on September 11, 1907 that Robert Baden-Powell's Brownsea Island Scouting encampment was proposed and his recommendation that Boy Scout groups should be formed. Readers were interest in forming Scouting groups and the editor staff initial support this move indicate that Baden-Powell would be consulted.

Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia

Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia, fully Cronica di lu rebellamentu di Sichilia contra re Carlu, is a Sicilian historical tract of the War of the Vespers written around 1290. The anonymous "Rebellamentu", probably written at Messina, was ascribed to Atanasiu di Iaci by Pasquale Castorina in 1883. Though the "Rebellamentu" sometimes adds valuable details to the history of the Vespers, it is frequently untrustworthy. Its monastic provenance is evident in its moralising tone. The antiquity of its language has placed its authenticity beyond doubt, despite its lack of an early manuscript tradition. This has not prevented speculation that it was written contemporarily with events: one verb in one manuscript is found in the first-person present; this may represent the author inadvertently stepping out of his usual frame of reference, or merely an error in that manuscript.
The "Rebellamentu" covers the years 1279–82 and treats John of Procida as a hero. It is also the earliest chronicle to record that violence broke out after a Sicilian woman was raped by a French soldier, a story also recorded by Atanasiu di Iaci elsewhere. It says that when the Sicilians complained to Charles of Anjou about their high taxes, he responded, ""Vi farro spendiri munita di soli, como altra volta havitu spisu"," threatening that he would re-issue leather money as had been done in the past. This probably indicates that the legend that William I issued leather money, otherwise first recorded by Tommaso Fazello in his "De Rebus Siculis" (1558), was current in the late thirteenth century. The "Rebellamentu" also makes the Orsini Pope Nicholas III party to a conspiracy to dethrone Charles of Anjou. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani, who was biased against the Orsini because of the legation of Napoleone Orsini to Florence in 1306, supports the allegation. 
The "Rebellamentu" covers John's negotiations with the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus and with Peter III of Aragon, the Sicilian Vespers, the coronation of Peter in Palermo in August 1282, the retreat of Charles to Calabria, and the entry of Peter and John into Messina in October 1282. The excerpt below describes how Peter was crowned by the Bishop of Cefalù because the incumbent of the Archdiocese of Palermo, Piero II de Santa Fede, had recently died, and the Archbishop of Monreale, Giovanni Roccamezza, was away in Rome:
Two later Tuscan histories of the Vespers—the "Liber Jani de Procida et Palialoco" and the "Leggenda di Messer Gianni di Procida"—may share the "Reballamentu" as a source. Conversely, all three may derive from an earlier, now lost source. All three agree on the centrality of John of Procida in the Vespers. The opera "Les vêpres siciliennes" (1855), with music by Giuseppe Verdi and a libretto by Eugène Scribe, drew upon the "Rebellamentu" for elements of its story, notably the rape.

Shipwreck Kelly

John Simms "Shipwreck" Kelly (July 8, 1910August 17, 1986) was a professional American football player who played halfback in the National Football League; he was also an owner and banker, most prominent in New York City in the 1930s and 1940s. He played five seasons for the New York Giants (1932) and the Brooklyn Dodgers (1933–1937). Kelly became a player-coach and later a player/coach/owner with the Dodgers football club, the successor to the Dayton Triangles, a charter member of the NFL. The Dodgers, through a couple of reorganizations, became the Baltimore Colts, now the Indianapolis Colts. He gained his nickname from his ability,while at the University of Kentucky, to make a "shipwreck" of opposing defensive lines, or from Alvin "Shipwreck" Kelly, who was famous for pole-sitting in the 1920s.
Biography.
He was a big, handsome swaggering star with a barrel chest and bowling-pin legs and was often compared to Babe Ruth. He had a charming outsized personality that was unfazed by New York society. He was frequently in attendance at the Stork Club, "21" and El Morocco.
At age 23, Kelly became a player/coach and later a player/coach/owner with the Dodgers football club, which he bought with a partner, Dan Topping. The Dodgers football club was the successor to the Dayton Triangles, a charter member of the NFL. The Dodgers, through a couple of reorganizations, became the Baltimore Colts, now the Indianapolis Colts.
Kelly's real claim to fame was his 1941 marriage, in New York City, to the "Millionaire Debutante" Brenda Frazier, after whom the long-running comic strip "Brenda Starr" was named. The couple bought a new Packard Darrin convertible off the floor of the New York Auto Show, and palled around NYC with the likes of Jock Whitney and Tom Kerrigan. They were married for fifteen years, and had one daughter Brenda Victoria . In 1956, he married Catherine Hannon. They had a son John Kelly who was in the winter olympics 1980
During World War II, Kelly was recruited by the FBI to travel to Cuba, Mexico, Peru, Chile and Argentina to track the activities of wealthy German expatriates helping the Nazi cause.

Wincentz Thurmann Ihlen

Wincentz Thurmann Ihlen (2 May 1826 – 18 January 1892) was a Norwegian engineer and industrialist.
He was born in Holmestrand as the son of Nils Ihlen and Barbara Wincentz Thurmann. His brother Jacob Thurmann Ihlen was a politician. In November 1852 Wincentz married Birgitte Elisabeth Mørch, granddaughter of Constitutional founding father Ole Clausen Mørch, and the couple had one daughter and three sons. His oldest son Nils Claus Ihlen would become a member of the national parliament and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
During the 1860s Ihlen started as an entrepreneur and bought several local enterprises and real estate. This included the farms at Haneborg, Granholt and Vittenberg, and the Nordby saw mill. Based at Fjellhamar Farm in Lørenskog, he built up a major complex of saw mills and grain mills, establishing the first industrial complex in Lørenskog. The background for the establishment was the new railway line that ran past Lørenskog, giving easy access to lumber from the inner parts of the country, as well as to the port in Oslo. The mills were owned proprietorially until they incorporated as the limited company "A/S Fjeldhammer Brug" in 1893, and the company has today become part of Icopal.
Wincentz Thurmann Ihlen established his own mechanical workshop and iron works at Strømmen in 1873, under the name "W. Ihlen, Strømmen". The main product was railway cars, with the first being produced in 1874. After Wincentz's retirement the Ihlen family retained ownership of the company, with Nils Claus taking over the works in 1883, changing the name to Strømmens Værksted, and his sons Joakim and Alf Ihlen in 1908, who transformed it to a limited company.
He died in 1892 in Kristiania.

Sotion (Pythagorean)

Sotion (1st century), a native of Alexandria, was a Neopythagorean philosopher who lived in the age of Tiberius. He belonged to the school of Quintus Sextius which combined Pythagoreanism with Stoicism. Sotion was the teacher of Seneca the Younger, who "sat as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion." Seneca derived from him his admiration of Pythagoreanism, and quotes Sotion's views concerning vegetarianism and the migration of the soul:
You do not believe that souls are assigned, first to one body and then to another, and that our so-called death is merely a change of abode? You do not believe that in cattle, or in wild beasts, or in creatures of the deep, the soul of him who was once a man may linger? You do not believe that nothing on this earth is annihilated, but only changes its haunts? And that animals also have cycles of progress and, so to speak, an orbit for their souls, no less than the heavenly bodies, which revolve in fixed circuits? Great men have put faith in this idea; therefore, while holding to your own view, keep the whole question in abeyance in your mind. If the theory is true, it is a mark of purity to refrain from eating flesh; if it be false, it is economy. And what harm does it do to you to give such credence? I am merely depriving you of food which sustains lions and vultures.
It was perhaps this Sotion who was the author of a treatise on anger, quoted by Stobaeus. Plutarch also quotes a Sotion as the authority for certain statements respecting towns founded by Alexander the Great in India, which he had heard from his contemporary Potamo of Mytilene. He may be the same Sotion who is quoted by John Tzetzes as the authority for some other statements relating to India.

<doc id="19529000" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19529000" title="Algebra tile">
Algebra tile

Algebra tiles are known as mathematical manipulatives that allow students to better understand ways of algebraic thinking and the concepts of algebra. These tiles have proven to provide concrete models for elementary school, middle school, high school, and college-level introductory algebra students. They have also been used to prepare prison inmates for their General Educational Development (GED) tests. Algebra tiles allow both an algebraic and geometric approach to algebraic concepts. They give students another way to solve algebraic problems other than just abstract manipulation. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) recommends a decreased emphasis on the memorization of the rules of algebra and the symbol manipulation of algebra in their "Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for Mathematics". According to the NCTM 1989 standards "elating models to one another builds a better understanding of each".
Physical attributes.
The algebra tiles are made up of small squares, large squares, and rectangles. The number one is represented by the small square, which is also known as the unit tile. The rectangle represents the variable x and the large square represents x2. The length of the side of the large square is equal to the length of the rectangle, also known as the x tile. When visualizing these tiles it is important to remember that the area of a square is s2, which is the length of the sides squared. So if the length of the sides of the large square is x then it is understandable that the large square represents x2. The width of the x tile is the same length as the side length of the unit tile. The reason that the algebra tiles are made this way will become clear through understanding their use in factoring and multiplying polynomials.
Commercially made algebra tiles are usually made from plastic and have one side of one color and the other side of another color. the difference in the color is supposed to denote one side that is positive and one side that is negative. Traditionally, one side is red to represent the negative and one side is green to represent the positive. Having the two colors on both sides allows for more numbers to be represented with the same tiles. It also makes it easier to change positives to negatives when performing a procedure such as multiplying a positive and a negative number. There are some tiles where the positive x and x2 tile will be the same color, but the positive unit tile is a different color. This representation is still all right to use, it is just important to have a least two colors to denote positive and negative. Translucent plastic algebra tiles can be bought for the overhead projector.
Algebra tiles can be made. Templates for the algebra tiles can be found online,Algebra tile template, which can be printed and then cut out. Once the shapes are cut out of the printer paper they can be used to cut out algebra tiles from card stock or Foamies, which are foam-like materials, about 1/8-inch thick. Algebra tiles can also be made for the overhead projector by cutting the shapes out of colored plastic report covers.
Virtual Algebra Tiles are available from The National Library of Virtual Manipulatives, the Ubersketch and in the sample files that ship with The Geometer's Sketchpad."
Uses.
Subtracting integers.
Algebra tiles can also be used for subtracting integers. A person can take a problem such as formula_1 and begin with a group of six unit tiles and then take three away to leave you with three left over, so then formula_2. Algebra tiles can also be used to solve problems like formula_3.get if you had the problem formula_4. Being able to relate these two problems and why they get the same answer is important because it shows that formula_5. Another way in which algebra tiles can be used for integer subtraction can be seen through looking at problems where you subtract a positive integer from a smaller positive integer, like formula_6. Here you would begin with five positive unit tiles and then you would add zero pairs to the five positive unit tiles until there were eight positive unit tiles in front of you. Adding the zero pairs will not change the value of the original five positive unit tiles you originally had. You would then remove the eight positive unit tiles and count the number of negative unit tiles left. This number of negative unit tiles would then be your answer, which would be -3.
Multiplication of integers.
Multiplication of integers with algebra tiles is performed through forming a rectangle with the tiles. The length and width of your rectangle would be your two factors and then the total number of tiles in the rectangle would be the answer to your multiplication problem. For instance in order to determine 3×4 you would take three positive unit tiles to represent three rows in the rectangle and then there would be four positive unit tiles to represent the columns in the rectangle. This would lead to having a rectangle with four columns of three positive unit tiles, which represents 3×4. Now you can count the number of unit tiles in the rectangle, which will equal 12.
Modeling and simplifying algebraic expressions.
Modeling algebraic expressions with algebra tiles is very similar to modeling addition and subtraction of integers using algebra tiles. In an expression such as formula_7 you would group five positive x tiles together and then three negative unit tiles together to represent this algebraic expression. Along with modeling these expressions, algebra tiles can also be used to simplify algebraic expressions. For instance, if you have formula_8 you can combine the positive and negative x tiles and unit tiles to form zero pairs to leave you with the expression formula_9. Since the tiles are laid out right in front of you it is easy to combine the like terms, or the terms that represent the same type of tile.
The distributive property is modeled through the algebra tiles by demonstrating that a(b+c)=(a×b)+(a×c). You would want to model what is being represented on both sides of the equation separately and determine that they are both equal to each other. If we want to show that formula_10 then we would make three sets of one unit tile and one x tile and then combine them together to see if would have formula_11, which we would.
Solving linear equations.
Manipulating algebra tiles can help students solve linear equations. In order to solve a problem like formula_12 you would first place one x tile and six negative unit tiles in one group and then two positive unit tiles in another. You would then want to isolate the x tile by adding six positive unit tiles to each group, since whatever you do to one side has to be done to the other or they would not be equal anymore. This would create six zero pairs in the group with the x tile and then there would be eight positive unit tiles in the other group. this would mean that formula_13. You can also use the subtraction property of equality to solve your linear equation with algebra tiles. If you have the equation formula_14, then you can add seven negative unit tiles to both sides and create zero pairs, which is the same as subtracting seven. Once the seven unit tiles are subtracted from both sides you find that your answer is formula_15. There are programs online that allow students to create their own linear equations and manipulate the algebra tiles to solve the problem. Solving Linear Equations Program This video from TeacherTube also demonstrates how algebra tiles can be used to solve linear equations. Teacher Tube Solving Equations
Solving linear systems.
Linear systems of equations may be solved algebraically by isolating one of the variables and then performing a substitution. Isolating a variable can be modeled with algebra tiles in a manner similar to solving linear equations (above), and substitution can be modeled with algebra tiles by replacing tiles with other tiles.
Multiplying polynomials.
When using algebra tiles to multiply a monomial by a monomial you first set up a rectangle where the length of the rectangle is the one monomial and then the width of the rectangle is the other monomial, similar to when you multiply integers using algebra tiles. Once the sides of the rectangle are represented by the algebra tiles you would then try to figure out which algebra tiles would fill in the rectangle. For instance, if you had x×x the only algebra tile that would complete the rectangle would be x2, which is the answer.
Multiplication of binomials is similar to multiplication of monomials when using the algebra tiles . Multiplication of binomials can also be thought of as creating a rectangle where the factors are the length and width. As with the monomials, you set up the sides of the rectangle to be the factors and then you fill in the rectangle with the algebra tiles. This method of using algebra tiles to multiply polynomials is known as the area model and it can also be applied to multiplying monomials and binomials with each other. An example of multiplying binomials is (2x+1)×(x+2) and the first step you would take is set up two positive x tiles and one positive unit tile to represent the length of a rectangle and then you would take one positive x tile and two positive unit tiles to represent the width. These two lines of tiles would create a space that looks like a rectangle which can be filled in with certain tiles. In the case of this example the rectangle would be composed of two positive x2 tiles, five positive x tiles, and two positive unit tiles. So the solution is 2x2+5x+2.
Factoring.
In order to factor using algebra tiles you start out with a set of tiles that you combine into a rectangle, this may require the use of adding zero pairs in order to make the rectangular shape. An example would be where you are given one positive x2 tile, three positive x tiles, and two positive unit tiles. You form the rectangle by having the x2 tile in the upper right corner, then you have two x tiles on the right side of the x2 tile, one x tile underneath the x2 tile, and two unit tiles are in the bottom right corner. By placing the algebra tiles to the sides of this rectangle we can determine that we need one positive x tile and one positive unit tile for the length and then one positive x tile and two positive unit tiles for the width. This means that the two factors are formula_16 and formula_17. In a sense this is the reverse of the procedure for multiplying polynomials.
Completing the square.
The process of completing the square can be accomplished using algebra tiles by placing your x2 tiles and x tiles into a square. You will not be able to completely create the square because there will be a smaller square missing from your larger square that you made from the tiles you were given, which will be filled in by the unit tiles. In order to complete the square you would determine how many unit tiles would be needed to fill in the missing square. In order to complete the square of x2+6x you start off with one positive x2 tile and six positive x tiles. You place the x2 tile in the upper left corner and then you place three positive x tiles to the right of the x2 tile and three positive unit x tiles under the x2 tile. In order to fill in the square we need nine positive unit tiles. we have now created x2+6x+9, which can be factored into formula_18.

Karp Zolotaryov

Karp Ivanovich Zolotaryov (, fl. last quarter of the 17th century) was a Muscovite painter, interior designer and wood carver, employed by Posolsky prikaz and the Kremlin Armoury. Zolotaryov was the author of iconostasis of the Transfiguration church in Novodevichy Convent and the Church of the Intercession at Fili and the icons of Donskoy Monastery. Surviving paintings by Zolotaryov, created in the period directly preceding the reforms of Peter I, form a bridge between traditional Orthodox icon painting and the modern realistic painting introduced in Russia in the 18th century.
Biography.
The identity of Karp Zolotaryov was discovered in archives by Ivan Snegiryov and first published in print in 1857. For the next hundred years Zolotaryov was known only through archival evidence: historians knew the sites where he worked and the themes of his icons but could not positively attribute the unsigned icons to the artist. In 1955 Elena Ovchinnikova was the first to attribute an apparently unsigned icon of the Fili church to Zolotaryov. In 1960s this was confirmed by a newly found autograph of Zolotaryov on the iconostasis of the Fili church; more autographs were discovered during restoration of its icons in 1973.
The year of birth and family origins of Zolotaryov are unknown. Official records declared him "a natural born and eternal slave" () of the Tsar. In 1667–1672 Zolotaryov was an apprentice to Bogdan Saltanov, an Armenian-born lead painter of the Kremlin Armoury. By 1680 Zolotaryov, still employed by the Armoury, trained his own class of at least five identified apprentices. His 15-year tenure at the Armoury was dedicated primarily to the interiors of the Kremlin and country residences of the Romanovs. Work assignments included designing and carving furniture, painting palace frescoes and church art, realistic parsuna portraits and even a handmade calendar of the celestial movement (1679) for teaching Peter I who was then seven years old. All this artwork was eventually lost with the exception of two carved khorugv stakes.
In March 1681 Feodor III of Russia sent Zolotaryov to Ukraine to study Ukrainian church architecture. The assignment coincided with Feodor's plans to build a new palace and spiritual center on the Presnya River. In May 1681, immediately upon Zolotaryov's return, Feodor authorized construction of a new church of "previously unknown layout", presumably modeled upon Saint Nicholas cathedral in Nizhyn; the project was abandoned when Feodor died in 1682. In the same year Zolotaryov was transferred to the gold-painting workshop of Posolsky prikaz (equivalent of modern ministries of foreign affairs) and awarded an unusually high salary of 138 roubles annually. The workshop, an extension of the Armory, traditionally produced illuminated manuscripts, however, Zolotaryov was not involved in this function; the only book credited to him was the "Book on building mills" (1691). Instead, Zolotaryov led interior decoration "department" within the workshop; he designed and personally carved the beds of Ivan V, his sisters Feodosia, Natalia and Ekaterina, and for Vasily Golitsyn. The least expensive of these beds cost more than his annual pay. In 1686 Vasily Golitsyn paid Zolotaryov 126 roubles for painting, presumably, icons and murals of Golitsyn's country church.
In the 1680s Zolotaryov was regularly commissioned to design, carve and erect templa; his work in the Dormition Cathedral, lesser churches of the Kremlin and the church of Izmaylovo Estate has disappeared, but the eight-level Baroque iconostasis of the Transfiguration church of Novodevichy Convent is extant in its original form. Zolotaryov also worked on the iconostasis and icons of the Donskoy Monastery and New Jerusalem Monastery, but these works were severely altered by later renovation and cannot be reliably attributed. Lev Naryshkin, who became chief of the Prikaz in 1989, assigned Zolotaryov to work on the interiors of the Church of Intercession in his Fili estate. The iconostasis and three icons signed by Zolotaryov (1692–1694) are also extant (the icon of Saint Stephan was relocated to Andrey Rublyov museum). More icons attributed to Zolotaryov are preserved in the Museum of Andrey Rublyov and in Novodevichy Convent. Icons attributed to "Zolotaryov School" are displayed at Ostankino Palace and other museums.
European Baroque influence was common among Moscow artists of the period (Vasily Poznansky, Bogdan Saltanov et al.); Zolotaryov's painting stands out among them for its use of contrasting shadows approaching that of the Italian chiaroscuro school, for its sculpture-like depiction of bodies and for its finely detailed depiction of clothing and crowns. The faces of saints share the same elongated, almond-shaped outline with thin, long noses and small mouths. 
Presumably, the artist died or retired in 1698: in that year his name disappeared from known official records; his chair at the workshop passed to Ivan Refusitsky.

French Pass

French Pass (Te Aumiti) is a narrow and treacherous stretch of water that separates D'Urville Island, at the north end of the South Island of New Zealand, from the mainland coast. At one end is Tasman Bay, and at the other end the outer Pelorus Sound leads out to Cook Strait.
French Pass has the fastest tidal flows in New Zealand, reaching 8 knots (4 m/s). When the tide changes, the current can be strong enough to stun fish. The local tribes are Ngāti Koata and Ngāti Kuia.
History.
In the oral tradition of some Māori tribes, French Pass is the resting place of Kupe's pet king shag, called Te Kawau-a-Toru. Kupe was a pioneer Polynesian navigator who discovered Cook Strait in his canoe. While he was exploring Cook Strait, Kupe was attacked by a giant octopus. In the furious battle to kill the octopus, the coast was gouged into the convoluted shapes that today make up the Sounds. Kupe's loyal shag then led Kupe to the French Pass passage, and explored the area on Kupe's behalf. Te Kawau-a-Toru had a huge wingspan, and was reputed to be a sacred bird with "the eye of the ancestor", insight into ancient knowledge. However, while testing the channel to see if it was safe for Kupe's canoe, Te Kawau-a-Toru got caught in the tidal rip, broke a wing and drowned. The broken reef adjacent to the channel is Kupe's loyal bird turned to stone – Te Aumiti a te Kawau-a-Toru (the currents that swallowed Toru's shag). A nearby rocky point where a lighthouse now stands is the bird's petrified bones.
The first recorded European navigation of the pass occurred in 1827. Admiral Jules Dumont d'Urville navigated the pass during his second voyage to New Zealand, in the French Navy corvette "Astrolabe". Approaching the narrowest part of the pass, the vessel swung sideward and did not respond to steerage. The corvette struck rocks twice, and was then washed over the reef and into Admiralty Bay. The high energy and complexity of the location was summed up by d'Urville suggesting that no one should attempt to navigate French Pass except in extreme emergency.
In 1888, a Risso's dolphin appeared in the area. For the next 24 years, this dolphin accompanied boats to and from French Pass. He became famous as Pelorus Jack and was the first dolphin in the world to receive the protection of the law. Pelorus Jack stayed in the Pelorus Sounds, and did not navigate the pass into Tasman Bay. He would meet boats as they came out of the pass, riding their bow waves for to Pelorus Sound. Then he would join boats returning to Nelson at the entrance to Pelorus Sound and escort them back to the pass. Pelorus Jack was last seen in April 1912. The lightkeeper at French Pass claimed he found the body of Pelorus Jack decomposing on the shore.
Tidal flows.
The pass is across, but the main navigation channel (the "throat" or "narrows") contracts down to only with a deep shoaling region. Most of the rest of the pass is broken reef. 
On one side is Cook Strait with a tidal range up to , and on the other side is Tasman Bay with a tidal range up to . This can result in substantial pressure gradients across the pass, complicated by a phase or time difference of about 25 minutes between the high tides on either side. Peak flow in the throat of the pass is around .
Near to the pass are deep holes where strong vertical flows can occur. In 2000, student divers taking part in a drift dive during the local ebb flow were separated from their surface float and caught in a whirlpool. This dragged them into "Jacob's Hole", a deep depression south west of the pass. The depth of this descent resulted in multiple fatalities. The group appears to have been drawn deep into the hole and then returned to the surface again. A dive computer record of one of the survivors show a depth of up to . According to the coroner's report, the accident occurred on a falling tide, so the current was flowing from the south west to the north east.

Michelle Morse

Michelle Morse (1982–2005) was an advocate for student health rights. A new federal law passed in 2008 is named for her to acknowledge her efforts to ensure that college students did not lose their access to health insurance when taking a leave of absence for a serious illness.
Ms. Morse was a student at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire when she was diagnosed with cancer on December 12, 2003. Her physician stated that she needed to quit school to undergo therapy. However, Ms. Morse found that the leave of absence would nullify her insurance. Instead, Ms. Morse chose to continue her studies while undergoing therapy. She maintained better than a 3.0 grade point average, taught classes, and took on the state and national legislatures to enact laws that would protect student health benefits. She graduated "cum laude" in May 2005. She died November 10, 2005.

The Numerati

The Numerati is a non-fiction book written by Stephen L. Baker. Baker interviews people who are studying, developing and implementing the technologies and techniques used to capture and analyze many of our everyday actions as we communicate, travel and make purchases. He explains how the initial goal of this data capture and analysis is typically to identify sets of characteristics, which makes it easier to manage the billions of data points these sets may contain. As these characteristics are grouped, it is hoped that the members of each group can be better understood. This information can then be used, with varying but often increased success, in early incident detection, to predict outcomes, project the effect of stimulus on the groups and, in many cases, to influence group members' behavior.

WhosHere

WhosHere is a social proximity networking app created by WhosHere founders Bryant Harris and Stephen Smith launched in July 2008. WhosHere utilizes GPS location capabilities combined with a social networking platform that allows users to interact with other people based on compatible geographical location. The app allows users to find other users with similar interests and connect with them real-time via free text, image messages and free VoIP calls without disclosing any personal information. It runs on Apple iOS devices including iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
Service Overview.
The free application was launched in July 2008 on Apple’s iTunes App Store as a geosocial networking and discovery service that allows iPhone and iPod touch users to see where they are in relation to each other. Features include being able to text message other users, see a list of nearby users, list of new users and a history list of users that have exchange messages. Now one can call via wi-fi with the iPod touch or iPhone if you have a mic. (version 2.1)
On September 23, 2008, the ability to send pictures between users was added to the application.
WhosHere has a user base of more than 8 million and is used globally in more than 150 countries. WhosHere announced the sending of its 4 billionth free text message.
Platforms.
WhosHere is available on iOS & Android and can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store and Google Play. WhosHere is also available via the Web. 
Trademark Dispute.
On June 1, 2012, allegations came forth that WhosHere, Inc. was suing the developer of a similar application. Brian Hamachek authored an application named "Who's Near Me" in 2010 and was requested by WhosHere (in 2011) to change the name of his application. Mr. Hamachek agreed to this. Subsequently, Mr. Hamachek reconsidered his decision and revived the "WhosNearMe" app name. WhosHere reasserted it's claim of trademark infringement, unfair competition, cybersquatting, and breach of contract. WhosHere also offered to license Mr. Hamachek's technology, compensate him for that and use his services as an ongoing contractor on the project.
Mr. Hamachek made a variety of claims against WhosHere, which he ultimately recanted and posted a joint statement with WhosHere. Mr. Hamacheck's portion of the statement focused on three things. 1) Mr. Hamcheck had agreed to change the name of his app to "WNM Live" and subsequently changed it back despite the agreement between the two parties. 2) Correcting the record that WhosHere did not originally send a cease and desist notice. 3) That he was "confident that WhosHere and its attorney did not mislead me" as originally alleged. WhosHere's portion of the statement thanked Mr. Hamacheck for resolving the matter and their goal was to defend their brand name.
WhosHere, Inc..
WhosHere is a San Mateo, CA and Alexandria, VA-based developer of the location-based social networking application called WhosHere®. The company was founded by Bryant Harris and Stephen Smith.

Thure Kumlien

Thure Ludwig Theodor Kumlien (November 9, 1819 – August 5, 1888) was a Swedish-American ornithologist, naturalist, and taxidermist. A contemporary of Thoreau, Audubon, and Agassiz, he contributed much to the knowledge of the natural history of Wisconsin and its birds. He collected and shipped specimens to many investigators in the United States and abroad. He taught botany and zoology, as well as foreign languages, at Albion Academy, and was particularly regarded as an expert in the identification of birds’ nests.
Family and early life.
Thure Kumlien was born in 1819 in the parish of Härlunda in Västergötland, Sweden, the oldest of fourteen children in an aristocratic Swedish family. His father, Ludwig Kumlien (1790–1839), was an army quartermaster, and owned several large estates. His mother, Johanna Rhodin (1800–1830) was the daughter of a minister. His early education was with a tutor, after which he entered the Gymnasium of Skara. He subsequently attended Uppsala University, graduating in 1843. He took an early interest in natural history and collected many specimens, particularly from the Baltic islands, sending them to Hermann Schlegel of Leiden; Wilhelm Peters of Berlin, Carl Jakob Sundevall of the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, and John Cassin of Boston were among his other correspondents.
Career.
Kumlien emigrated to the United States in 1843, accompanied by his fiancée, Margaretta Christina Wallberg, and her sister. They first settled in Milwaukee and were married there on September 5 of the same year. Not long afterward, drawn by letters written by the minister of a local parish, he came to the Lake Koshkonong area of Wisconsin. When he bought his homestead, he bypassed farmland and instead purchased woodland, probably because of his love of nature, and devoted his spare time to the study of surrounding nature, in particular the local plants, birds, and insects. His first purchase was , from the government; he bought another 40 acres later. His first home was a log house near Busseyville. Often distracted by local wildlife and plants, Kumlien did not succeed at farming; he supplemented his farm income with taxidermy and by collecting specimens for museums and other scientists.
Kumlien's life work constituted a rich personal herbarium and an important collection of birds. He began with a collection acquired by the Boston Society of Natural Sciences in 1854, and expanded his reach to Europe, sending specimens to such scientists as Elias Magnus Fries of Uppsala and Thomas Mayo Brewer. He also kept up correspondence with Spencer Fullerton Baird, Edward Augustus Samuels, and others. Kumlien was described by no less a luminary than Louis Agassiz as the world's foremost authority on the identification of birds' nests. Combined with his modesty, his collecting and correspondence made him more widely known to fellow scientists than to his neighbors. In spite of the recognition and the regard he received from the scientific community, he lived in tight financial circumstances nearly all of his life.
Through the efforts of Rasmus Bjørn Anderson, Kumlien accepted a position in the faculty of Albion Academy, in Albion, Wisconsin. From 1867 to 1870, he taught not only botany and zoology, but also foreign languages; he left when financial turmoil hit the college. He took a position with the State of Wisconsin in 1870, collecting specimens for the University of Wisconsin in Madison and the teacher training school (the university’s collections were destroyed in a fire in 1884). From 1881 to 1883, he worked for the Wisconsin Natural History Society as taxidermist and conservator of its collections.
In 1883, the Natural History Society's collections were transferred to the Milwaukee Public Museum, and Kumlien began working for the museum in the same capacity, which enabled him to pursue his naturalist studies year round. He became a member of the American Ornithologists' Union the year it was founded (1883). He died in 1888, most likely as a result of exposure to preservatives used on bird specimens sent from South America. He is buried at Sweet Cemetery, in Albion. His work can still be viewed at numerous museums in Europe and America.
Legacy.
Thure and Margaretta Kumlien had five children (three sons and two daughters), including Augusta Kumlien (1845–1845), Aaron Ludwig Kumlien (1853–1902), Theodore V. Kumlien (1855–?), and Frithiof Kumlien (1859–1888). Augusta and Frithiof are buried with their parents.
Kumlien trained his son, Ludwig Kumlien, an ornithologist, and also Edward Lee Greene, a botanist.
Kumlien was also acquainted with Willard North, the father of author Sterling North; the younger North included him in such books as "Rascal" and "The Wolfling".
A number of species have been named for Kumlien:

<doc id="19529508" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19529508" title="Flat spot">
Flat spot

A Flat spot, or Wheel flat, is a fault in railroad wheel shape. A flat spot occurs when a rail vehicle's wheelset is dragged along the rail after the wheel/axle has stopped rotating. Flat spots are usually caused by faulty brakes or wheelset bearings. It can also be caused by use of the emergency brake, or slip and slide conditions that causes wheels to lock up while the train is still moving.
Consequences.
If the flat spot is very small, the rail vehicle will be able to continue being used. The fault is removed later in the wheelset turning process, using a wheel lathe. However, because of the heat suffered while being dragged along the rail and the impacts suffered afterward, these wheels are more likely to break due to changes in the alloy structure.
If the flat spot is very large (as in the picture), strands of molten metal may have got stuck on one side of the flat spot, making it impossible for the wheel to turn due to insufficient clearance between the rolling surface and the brake block. In this case, the wheelset must be replaced immediately.
In extreme cases, a wheel with an untreated flat spot can damage the track and cause a derailment.
Automobile use.
Engine response.
In automobile parlance, a flat spot occurs when the driver presses the accelerator pedal and there is a delay in the engine's response. This fault was more common before cars had electronic fuel injection. Many engines, especially modified ones, still have flat spots in the torque curve due to resonances in the intake system, although manufacturers try to eliminate these by use of a plenum chamber, careful design and testing.
Car tires.
A literal flat spot can occur on car tires if the vehicle is parked without moving for some time (generally longer than a week), and the tire deformation at the bottom of the wheel becomes semi-permanent. The flat spot gradually relieves itself when the car is driven but can temporarily give similar symptoms to an unbalanced wheel. Cars being laid up for extended periods should be kept on axle stands or have the tires over-inflated to eliminate or reduce this problem.

1988 Winchester 400

The nineteenth annual Winchester 400 motor race (run yearly since 1970) was held under American Speed Association sanction on October 2, 1988, at the Winchester Speedway, in Indiana (USA).
In dominating fashion, Ted Musgrave of Grand Marsh, Wisconsin, won the first ASA race of his career in the 1988 running of the Winchester 400. Leading a total of 319 laps in the Baker Enterprises Chevrolet, he collected $10,735 for his initial victory.
The race.
Starting on the outside of the front row, Musgrave shot into the lead at the drop of the green and would lead the first 130 circuits. Dave Jackson led his first laps of the day when Musgrave stopped in the pits for service. Rain showers interrupted the race after 138 laps, with Jackson leading before a flurry of pit stops. After a two-hour rain delay, Kenny Wallace led for 71 circuits. Working back through the field, Musgrave stormed back into the lead on lap 210 and never looked back as he paced the field for the final 191 circuits. Harold Fair finished a lap back of the leader in second place followed by Gary St. Amant, Jackson, and Buddy Schrock (son of the 1973 winner Vern Schrock) rounding out the top-five.
Title contender and polesitter Butch Miller was never a factor as he dropped back through the field in the early stages before pitting on lap 73 and losing several laps while the pit crew diagnosed a problem. Two-time winner Mike Eddy also lost several laps when he pitted under green for an overheating engine on lap 125. Running second in the early portions of the race, Dick Trickle lost over 100 laps in the pits while the crew replaced the right rear hub on his Chevrolet. Six-time winner Bob Senneker suffered mechanical problems and finished 12th after spending 50 laps in the pits.
With Eddy in the pits, Miller took the lead from Fair on lap 163. Dave Jackson then took a turn at the front when he made the pass for the lead on lap 236. After dropping back a few spots, Miller leaped from third to the lead all on lap 253 and then dominated the remaining circuits of the 400-lap race. Jackson’s strong run came to an abrupt halt when he lost and engine and pounded the fourth turn wall with 27 laps to go. Miller collected $10,150 for the win. Ted Musgrave backed up his 1988 win by finishing second. Tony Raines placed third with Fair, and Glenn Allen, Jr. rounding out the top-five.

<doc id="19529589" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19529589" title="Not In Our Town">
Not In Our Town

Not In Our Town is a documentary series and campaign that combines public television broadcasts with grassroots events, educational outreach and online activities to help communities battling hate talk to and learn from each other.
The Not In Our Town project was launched in 1995 with a national PBS special that told the story of how citizens of Billings, Montana joined forces to respond to hate crimes in their town. Their story helped create a new “model” for community response to bigotry and intolerance. Not In Our Town and its follow-up programs have been used in hundreds of communities during times of crisis.
Minister and musician Fred Small wrote a song of the same name, published in 1994, telling the same story in a different format.
Original story.
Not In Our Town began with a national PBS special which followed the story of how the citizens of Billings, Montana joined together to respond to a series of hate crimes in their town. White supremacist activities had been on the rise. Racist literature was found around town, skinheads disrupted the services of an African American church, the home of a Native American family was spraypainted with swastikas and racist slurs, and a brick was thrown the window of Jewish family's home. The film follows a powerful local force—law enforcement, civic leaders, faith groups, citizen activists and local media outlets—that sent a simple and powerful message to white supremacists: “not in our town.” After the film was broadcast in 1995, viewers around the country began to apply this model to their own communities.
Subsequent projects.
Since the original broadcast, hundred of towns coping with hate and hate crime have held Not in Our Town campaigns based on the Billings strategy. Now in its second decade, the Not In Our Town project has sparked anti intolerance activity in hundreds of communities in the United States and in other countries including South Africa, Ireland, Czech Republic and Ukraine.
The original "Not In Our Town" film led to two follow-up programs: Not In Our Town II and Not In Our Town Northern California: When Hate Happens Here. 
"Not In Our Town II", first broadcast in 1996, featured six stories from cities across the United States about communities acting against intolerance. "Not In Our Town Northern California", a co-production with KQED-TV, was the first-regional Not In Our Town special and organizing. The film looks at hate crimes and the responses to it in five communities over a five-year period. At last count, there have been over 80 community forums and screenings of this film.
Not In Our Town/Not In Our School provides stories, resources, and models for schools and communities seeking to build safer and more inclusive schools. The documentaries and website at pbs.org provide story based models and tools that help educators, students, parents and community leaders talk to and learn from each other about how to address bigotry and harassment. The core practice of the program is encouraging and spreading local innovation. The stories, programs and models that have been created so far have emerged from schools and student groups across the country and have been used in educational programs such as Facing History and Ourselves.
Not In Our Town was launched by The Working Group in 1995. Founded in 1988, The Working Group is an Oakland, California-based non-profit media company that combines television, internet and web resources with outreach and organizing efforts in the areas of workplace issues; race, diversity and the battle against intolerance; and encouraging democracy and citizen participation.

Judo at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's 100 kg

The men's 100 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on 9 September at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium.
This event was the second-heaviest of the men's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 100 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.
A total of eleven judokas competed in the event. A twelfth competitor, Ahmed Kebaili of Algeria, was disqualified for failing a pre-match medical exam. He was to have had a bye in the first round followed by a bout against the winner of the Bill Morgan-Mykola Lyivytskyi match. Because of Kebaili's disqualification, the winner of the Morgan-Lyivytskyi match instead received a bye into the third round.

Rock of Ages (musical)

Rock of Ages is a rock/jukebox musical, with a book by Chris D'Arienzo, built around classic rock hits from the 1980s, especially from the famous glam metal bands of the decade. The musical features songs from Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar, Twisted Sister, Steve Perry, Poison and Europe among other well-known rock bands.
It is directed by Kristin Hanggi and choreographed by Kelly Devine with music supervision, arrangements, and orchestrations by Ethan Popp and David Gibbs. Arrangements for the original Los Angeles production were furnished by David Gibbs and Kyle Puccia.
The show is noted for being more lighthearted and comedic than other shows on Broadway, although some critics have raised concern about the objectification of women and the minstrel-like performance of the mayor. During performance, the performers frequently break the "fourth wall", directly addressing the audience and seemingly forgetting (or perhaps reminding the audience) that they are actors in a musical. Despite the musical's title, the Def Leppard song of the same name is not included in the musical.
As of February 2014, it is the 31st longest-running Broadway show.
Synopsis.
Act I.
Lonny Barnett, who serves as the show's narrator, sets up the story: In 1987, an aspiring rocker named Drew Boley works as a busboy in the Hollywood bar/club called The Bourbon Room, owned by Dennis Dupree and assisted by Lonny ("Just Like Paradise/Nothing But a Good Time"). He falls instantly for a girl, Sherrie Christian, who just arrived from Paola, Kansas hoping to make it big in acting ("Sister Christian"). Drew convinces Dennis to hire Sherrie as a waitress.
A pair of German developers, Hertz Klinemann and his son Franz, convince the city's Mayor to abandon the "sex, drugs and rock-n-roll" lifestyle of the Sunset Strip and introduce "clean living" into the area, much to the anger of the City Planner, Regina ("We Built This City"). When Dennis learns that part of the plan involves demolishing The Bourbon Room, he believes the club can generate more money by having rock star Stacee Jaxx and his band Arsenal, who recently announced their break-up, perform their last show at The Bourbon ("Too Much Time on My Hands"). He calls Stacee and convinces him to play the band's last show in the club where he had begun. As Drew struggles to write new lyrics, Sherrie urges him to go after his dreams ("I Wanna Rock"). Regina begins protesting Hertz and Franz's redevelopment plans ("We're Not Gonna Take It").
Later, after arguing with her parents during a phone call, Sherrie begins to discover feelings for Drew, who supports her dream. Also, Drew, auditioning to open for Arsenal, finds the lyrics he has been searching for and realizes that they have come from his feelings for Sherrie ("More Than Words/Heaven/To Be with You"). After obtaining the opening slot for Arsenal, Drew invites Sherrie to have a picnic in the hills overlooking Los Angeles ("Waiting For a Girl Like You"). There, he mistakenly suggests that the two are merely friends to calm their nerves, disappointing both of them and ruining the date.
Stacee Jaxx arrives at The Bourbon and gives an interview about his life ("Wanted Dead or Alive"). Sherrie is immediately smitten with him, and believing she means nothing to Drew, has sex with Stacee in the men's room ("I Want to Know What Love Is"). While Stacee and Sherrie are copulating, Drew opens for Stacee and Arsenal, not knowing a record producer is in the audience. After their tryst, Stacee tells Dennis to dismiss Sherrie before the concert begins. His guitarist realizes what Stacee did and knocks him out. The record producer in the club was impressed with Drew's performance and suggests he take over for Stacee. He then offers Drew a contract, which he accepts. Sherrie seeks comfort from Drew after she is fired, but having seen her go into the men's room with Stacee, he dismisses her ("Cum on Feel the Noize"). In the midst of these events, Regina continues her protest ("We're Not Gonna Take It ").
An upset and unemployed Sherrie meets Justice Charlier, the owner of the nearby Venus Club, which Justice prefers to call a "gentleman's club." She relates to Sherrie's story, saying that many of the small-town girls hoping to hit it big in LA end up making a living as strippers. Grudgingly, Sherrie accepts Justice's offer to work in her club ("Harden My Heart/Shadows of the Night"). As the act closes, everyone is alone – Drew, as an upcoming rock star; Sherrie, fending for herself as an exotic dancer; Regina protesting the redevelopment; and Dennis, trying to save his club ("Here I Go Again").
Act II.
Hertz and Franz begin demolition on the Sunset Strip, alienating them from each other as Franz falls for Regina and sees "the error of their ways." Dennis and Lonny join the fight with little success ("The Final Countdown"). Drew's rocker image is upsetting the record producer, and Sherrie is learning how things work at the Venus Club ("Any Way You Want It/I Wanna Rock "). When they meet on the street, Sherrie is embarrassed about her job and Drew is upset that his record company is attempting to reshape him into part of a boy band. They argue and Sherrie admits that she was crazy about Drew, but failed to make a move because he said they were friends. They part ways more troubled by these new revelations ("High Enough").
A drunken Stacee arrives at the Venus Club and is pleased to see Sherrie. After being forced to give him a lapdance, she beats him up while dancing ("I Hate Myself for Loving You/Heat of the Moment"). Drew arrives to admit his feelings to her, but becomes angry when he sees the two in a suggestive position and storms off. Justice later tells Drew that as soon as he left, Sherrie had punched Stacee in the jaw.
Regina continues her protest against the destruction of the Strip, but yields no success. She convinces Franz to stand up to his father if he does not believe in his father's vision. Franz admits that he has his own dream, namely to open a confectioner's store in Germany. He rebels against his father and admits his love for Regina ("Hit Me with Your Best Shot"). Meanwhile, Dennis and Lonny, upset at the loss of The Bourbon Room, suggest they have feelings for each other ("Can't Fight This Feeling").
Sherrie decides to leave the Venus Club after the scene with Drew, and Justice tells her that she had a similar experience with her first love. Everyone is in turmoil as they attempt to move on with their lives ("Every Rose Has Its Thorn"). Franz leaves for Germany and Hertz begins to regret the hurtful way he treated his son ("Keep on Lovin' You"). Regina arrives and explains to Hertz that Franz does "not" hate him; he simply wants his father to support his dream. Hertz later returns the deed to the Bourbon Room to Dennis and invests in Franz's confectionery store.
Drew, now a pizza delivery boy, realizes none of his dreams have come true—he still is not a rock star, and Sherrie is leaving on a midnight train. Lonny arrives and explains to Drew that his life is so miserable because they are all characters in a musical and that it was their book writer who made it so. He also reveals to Drew that he serves as the show's "dramatic conjurer" that if Drew wants a happy ending, it is up to "him" to get the girl. After hearing this, Drew realizes that he does not need fame to make him happy, only Sherrie ("Oh Sherrie"). He reaches her at the train station in time, and they realize that their love has survived all their trials and reconcile ("The Search Is Over").
In the epilogue, The Bourbon Room is spared from demolition and Stacee Jaxx, now a washed-up has-been who has been charged with statutory rape, flees to Uruguay ("Renegade"). Franz opens his confectionery store in Germany and has a long distance relationship with Regina, who becomes the new mayor of West Hollywood. Dennis passes away, leaving the Bourbon Room to Lonny, and Sherrie and Drew move to Glendale and start a family. Lonny notes that on The Strip, sometimes the dreams with which you enter are not always the dreams with which you leave, but they still rock ("Don't Stop Believin'").
Productions.
Early development.
The musical premiered on July 27, 2005 in Los Angeles at King King, a club on Hollywood Boulevard. It moved to the Vanguard Hollywood in January 2006 where it played for six weeks.

They have more energy than a cokehead groupie, and they clearly have fun as the belt out rock standards, making the six-year-old show still feel fresh and new.

<doc id="19529644" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19529644" title="Farallon Capital">
Farallon Capital

Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C. is an American global investment firm that manages capital on behalf of institutions and individuals. The firm was founded by Tom Steyer in 1986. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, the firm employs approximately 165 professionals in eight countries around the world.
Farallon primarily manages capital for university endowments, foundations, and high net worth individuals.
As of 2011, Farallon Capital Management is the 12th largest hedge fund in the world managing US $21.5 billion in assets.
History.
Tom Steyer founded Farallon in January 1986 with $15 million in seed capital. Previously, Steyer worked for San Francisco-based private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, as a risk arbitrage trader, under Robert Rubin, at Goldman Sachs and in Morgan Stanley's corporate mergers and acquisitions department.
Farallon made a name for itself by being one of the first firms to raise money from a university endowment.
In 1987 Tom Steyer a Yale undergraduate approached the university's endowerment to allocate funds to Farallon to manage. The Yale endowment declined based on the fees charged by Farallon. David Swensen, the head of the Yale endowment later came to an arrangement with Tom Steyer where he would initially not be charged by Farallon to manage an allocation of the Yale endowerment. After Yale's investment proved to be lucrative, many other college endowments and pensions began to invest in hedge funds.
Investment Strategy.
Farallon pioneered absolute return investing, a model focusing on potential returns as well as risk adjusted returns. Absolute return investing "treats every investment—whether a residential mortgage, a common stock, or a parcel of land—as a bond, with an implied rate of return." Farallon invests in various asset classes including value investments, credit investments, merger arbitrage, real estate related investments, and direct investments in both developed and emerging markets. Farallon typically holds positions anywhere from two to five years.
Farallon also practices "event driven" international investing, finding distressed international companies and helping the businesses restructure. In 1999, Farallon bought a direct stake in an Argentine shoe company, which it helped stabilize to profitability as Argentina recovered from an economic crisis. And in 2002, Farallon bought control of Bank Central Asia (BCA), an Indonesian financial institution, for $531 million. At the time, many of Indonesia's banks were on the verge of collapse because of bad loans made during President Suharto's leadership and the country was seen as dangerous for foreign investment. Over the next four years, Farallon installed a new chairman and made necessary reforms. After Farallon sold its stake for a profit in 2006, many other institutional investors began to look to Indonesia for returns. In the year before Farallon's investment in Indonesia, $286 million flowed into the country as foreign direct investment. After Farallon exited, that number grew to $1 billion in 2007 and $4 billion in 2008. According to Council on Foreign Relations economics fellow Sebastian Mallaby, "Farallon's investment was a blessing for Indonesia."
According to Institutional Investor's Alpha, Steyer considers "himself as a research-oriented fundamental investor, not a trader."
In March 2010, Farallon announced plans to refocus its investing on risk arbitrage and credit wagers and lessen its equity exposure. In addition, the firm said it would disclose more information to clients to "foster a more open culture at the hedge fund."
Investment Vehicles.
Farallon Capital Institutional Partners - for Farallon's institutional investors to invest in.
Investment History.
In 2007, Farallon in partnership with Simon Property Group and other hedge funds purchased Mills Corp, a real estate investment trust.
Company.
In 2006 it was reported that Farallon Capital was the largest hedge fund in the world in 2005. Steyer named the firm after the Farallon Islands off the coast of the San Francisco Bay Area.
Culture.
Farallon's corporate culture has been reported both as setting it apart from similar firms and also as traditional. During the firm's infancy, Steyer "insisted that Farallon employees keep their liquid savings in the fund so that they would feel the pain if they lost money." The firm rewards independent thinking and rigorous research, which has earned it the reputation as the "McKinsey of hedge funds."
Organization.
Tom Steyer and Andrew J.M. Spokes act as the firm's Co-Managing Partners. Spokes was promoted to the position in 2007. Prior to his promotion, Spokes oversaw portfolio management and strategy for Farallon exclusive subadviser Noonday Global Management. Spokes opened Farallon's first international office in London in 1998.
Farallon retains talent by giving enterprising professionals the opportunity to spin off and run new funds with Farallon capital. For example, Former Farallon traders started Noonday Global Management and ChinaRock Capital using Farallon money and back office support.
Today, Farallon has 21 principals, 13 managing directors and 35 investment professionals who oversee the firm's day-to-day operations and management.
Offices.

War in North-West Pakistan order of battle

The North-Western Contingent order of battle (NWPORBAT; officially order of battle is known as "Tri-services framework (TSW)"), is the comprehensive deposition and systematic structure of the unified Pakistan military forces in tackling down and controlling the insurgency in Western Pakistan. The deployments began in 2002 after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 in a response to the deadly terrorist attacks in New York, United States.
This article lists deployed unified military units under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) which controls both combatant operations and reconstruction efforts, which is often led by the National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB). Since 2002, the number of troops stationing and circling increased to keep the momentum and pressure on the insurgent groups laying militant attacks on Pakistan. In 2008, Chairman joint chiefs General Tariq Majid submitted his report on new deployment and formations under title as "Tri-services framework", to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani which was approved by the Prime minister.
Deployment of the military forces.
After the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the U.S. military responded with an large invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Initially, all Pakistan Army troops were mobilized in different military formations and deployment continued in all over the country during this period, under the command of Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf, also self-appointing President at that time. After laying discussion principle Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the XI Corps (roughly ~60,000 men) was deployed under the command of Lieutenant-General Alijan Aurakzai in North-western. Other formations were rested in eastern, southern, and the northern borders of the country. By 2004, additional battalions were stationed by General Musharraf to help curb infiltration into Pakistan through its porous border. On 7 October 2004, Musharraf approved the appointment of his close aide, General Ehsan-ul-Haq, who superseded seven colleagues who was brutally criticized by the media. The appointment was highly controversial and political since Admiral Shahid Karimullah, Chief of Naval Staff, was the senior-most four-star officer in the armed forces. After becoming the chairman joint chiefs, General Ehsan-ul-Haq oversaw the ground troops deployment of army only, while the air force was kept out of the region. The strategy proved to be wrong as the violence spread out all over the country, and the army was increasingly in great pressure from the militants in 2004-07. In 2007, chairman joint chiefs General Ehsan-ul-Haq admitted the only ground troops deployment was wrong as the "Waziristan truce went wrong". President Musharraf ordering the highly controversial and criticized military action, "Silence", to take over the Red Mosque complex plummeted Musharraf and General Ehsan's support. 
In 2007, President Musharraf approved the General Tariq Majid and General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani's appointment to four-star appointment. Keeping aware of the situation, General Majid began studying the new deployment of Pakistan armed forces. After Musharraf was ousted from the presidency in a threat of impeachment movement, General Majid submitted his studies to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and stressed out on the need to strengthen the tri-services framework. 
The new order of battle now known as, "tri-services framework", General Tariq Majid strongly emphasized to harmonize individual capacities of the services so that efforts are synergized within a framework of jointness and inter-operability to meet present and future challenges. Since 2008, the combined formations of Pakistan military has over a hundred thousand troops in the region. From open sources it seems that 4 Pakistan army divisions, assisted by the PAF and the navy, are involved in the operation, with a JS HQ coordinating their efforts. They appear to be two regular and two heavy infantry divisions Frontier Corps operates under a separate command, but its units are often parceled out to the Army. The Corps in the region, the XII Corps, usually has 2 infantry divisions, it has received from what can be gleaned from open sources two additional divisions, one from Multan; the 14th, and another from Kashmir; the 23rd.

1892–93 Ottawa Hockey Club season

The 1892–93 Ottawa Hockey Club season was the club's eighth season of play. The Club would play in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) and the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) leagues. Ottawa placed second in the AHAC championship. Ottawa won the OHA championship for the third year in a row after the Toronto Granites defaulted.
OHA season.
Results.
The Toronto Granite Club, scheduled to play the final in Ottawa, defaulted, giving the championship to Ottawa. The Granites suggested putting together a team composed of players from all Toronto teams. However, the Granites failed to organize the team and the game did not take place.
AHAC season.
The AHAC adopted a new round-robin format for the regular season, with the league winner to be the inaugural winner of the Stanley Cup. Each team played two games against other opponents.
Ottawa lost to the Montreal Victorias in the opening game of the schedule on January 7. It would be the Victorias only win of the season and was the margin between Ottawa in second and the Montreal Hockey Club in first place. Ottawa split its series with Montreal, handing Montreal its only loss. After the season, Ottawa challenged Montreal to a final playoff, but this was refused.

Snow Chief

Snow Chief (March 17, 1983, California – May 18, 2010) was an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse.
Background.
Snow Chief was bred by Carl Grinstead. In 1984, retired vaudevillian and successful real estate investor Ben Rochelle bought a fifty percent interest in Grinstead's Blue Diamond Ranch, thus becoming a half owner of the yearling. Snow Chief was one of several winners produced by the mare Miss Snowflake: the others included Mujaazif, who won the Royal Lodge Stakes in 1990.
Racing career.
1985: two-year-old season.
Conditioned by veteran California trainer Mel Stute, Snow Chief made nine starts at age two, winning five, including the Norfolk Stakes and the Hollywood Futurity. His 1985 performances earned him California Horse of the Year honors, but Tasso, the 1985 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner, was voted the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt.
1986: three-year-old season.
As a three-year-old, Snow Chief made a further nine starts. In California, he won two stakes races, then was sent to Florida, where he won the important Florida Derby. Back in California, he established himself as the solid Kentucky Derby favorite with a win in that state's most important race for three-year-olds, the Santa Anita Derby.
Snow Chief was sent off at even money as the bettors' choice in the Kentucky Derby but in a sixteen-horse field, he finished eleventh to winner Ferdinand. However, Snow Chief returned to form in the Preakness Stakes, defeating runner-up Ferdinand by four lengths. 
His handlers chose not to run him in the 1½ mile Belmont Stakes. Instead they later sent him to Monmouth Park Racetrack, where he won the Jersey Derby. For his performances in 1986, Snow Chief was named California Horse of the Year for the second straight year and was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.
1987: four-year-old season.
Snow Chief returned to racing as a four-year-old in 1987. From six starts, he won two and earned three seconds. His wins came in the Charles H. Strub Stakes at Santa Anita Racetrack in California and the Oaklawn Handicap at Oaklawn Park Race Track in Arkansas. He was voted California Horse of the Year for the third time.
Stud career.
He was retired to stud duty, producing offspring that have met with modest success. He stood at Diane Rochelle's Eagle Oak Ranch in Paso Robles, California, and died due to an apparent heart attack on the morning of May 18, 2010.

Coxlodge

Coxlodge is an area situated between Fawdon, Gosforth and Kenton in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
History.
By order of the Local Government Board on 20 September 1872, the parishes of South Gosforth and Coxlodge were constituted into an urban district, the South Gosforth Local Board. After the 1894 Local Government Act, it became the South Gosforth Urban District Council. A year later, by a Northumberland County Council order dated 14 March 1895, the title was changed again to Gosforth Urban District Council. The parishes of Coxlodge and South Gosforth were amalgamated into the parish of Gosforth in 1908. The Gosforth Urban District Council was finally abolished on 1 April 1974 to become part of Newcastle Metropolitan Borough Council.
Mining.
In the 19th century Coxlodge Colliery was in operation. There were two pits in the Coxlodge Colliery, the Jubilee Pit, which was on Jubilee Road opposite Jubilee Crescent, and the Regent Pit which is now the Regent Centre business park and St Charles R.C. School next to the current Metro line.
Notable residents.
Notable people who were born in Coxlodge include Tommy Glidden, an English footballer.
A number of wealthy people lived in a large residence called Coxlodge Hall, which was built in 1796 by Job Bulman, a medical man originally from Gateshead who had made his money in India. Bulman lived there until he died in 1818. The hall was sold a number of times and occupants included the soap manufacturer Thomas Hedley and shipbuilders Andrew Leslie and Sir Rowland Hodge. The Hall itself was destroyed by fire; the cottage and Coach House survived. In 1950 the coach house was eventually turned into offices. The current owners are Summers-Inman Construction and Property Consultants who bought the coach house of Coxlodge Hall in 1972 and have since renovated the location.
Transport.
The nearest modern day Tyne & Wear Metro stations are Fawdon and Wansbeck Road. There used to be a railway station called Coxlodge station, which was in use between 1905 and 1929 on the Ponteland and Darras Hall Branch of the North Eastern Railway. The site of this station is now occupied by Fawdon Metro station.
St Nicholas Hospital.
In the 1850s Newcastle upon Tyne's hospitals for mentally ill patients were overcrowding; a new asylum was promised in Coxlodge, where a farmstead had been purchased. It opened as Newcastle upon Tyne Borough Lunatic Asylum in July 1869. In 1882 it changed its name to Newcastle upon Tyne City Lunatic Asylum. In 1948 the National Health Service took over the hospital and changed the name to St Nicholas Hospital.

The Thomas-Morse MB-7 was an American racing plane built by Thomas-Morse Aircraft for the US Navy.
Development and design.
The MB-7 was built on the request of the US Navy. They had recently received the Thomas-Morse MB-3, and asked B Douglas Thomas to modify two of them to be racers. The first MB-7 was completed in 1921. It took part in the 1921 Pulitzer Trophy race, but during the race its fuel pump malfunctioned and it crashed and was destroyed by fire when a lighted match by a souvenir hunter which ignited the fuel. The second MB-7 was completed in January 1922. It first flew in 14 April 1922. It competed for the US Navy in the Pulitzer Trophy on 14 October 1922. Piloted by Captain Francis Pat Mulcahy it withdrew after 30 minutes with an overheating engine. It never flew again before being dismantled on 7 January 1925.

Ellobiidae

Ellobiidae, common name the hollow-shelled snails, is a family of small air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the clade Eupulmonata. Ellobiidae is the only family in the superfamily Ellobioidea, according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Anatomy.
In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes lies between 16 and 20 (according to the values in this table).
They have a distinctive mode of locomotion arising due to a split sole. The front part of the sole is attached to something and then the rear part of the sole is drawn up to the front part. 
Taxonomy.
Species are traditionally classified into five taxonomic groups, the Pythiidae, the Laemodontidae, the Melampodidae, the Ellobiidae and the Carychiidae. These taxa have been recognized either as families within Ellobioidea or as sub-families within the family Ellobiidae.
The family Ellobiidae consists of the following subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005):
The high degree of homoplasy in morphological characters and frequent low variability has led to the description of approximately 800 species names available in the literature, whereby 250 are likely to be valid.
A molecular study by Dayrat at al. (2011) for the Ellobioidea suggests a monophyletic origin of the entire group.
Genera.
Genera within the family Ellobiidae include:
subfamily Ellobiinae
subfamily Carychiinae
subfamily Melampinae
subfamily Pedipedinae
subfamily Pythiinae
† subfamily Zaptychiinae
subfamily ?
Genus "Sarnia" H. Adams & A. Adams, 1855 (temporary name, Sarnia "& A. Adams, 1855 (September), The Genera of Recent Mollusca, 2: 239" is an incorrect subsequent spelling of "Siona" H. Adams & A. Adams, 1855 which is a junior homonym of "Siona" Duponchel, 1829 .)
Ecology.
The taxon Ellobioidea comprises a group of morphologically and ecologically highly diverse snails, known to have successfully invaded the marine, brackish water and terrestrial habitats.
These are mostly snails that live in salt marshes and similar maritime habitats, and thus have a tolerance for saline conditions.

Anterograde tracing

In neuroscience, anterograde tracing is a research method which is used to trace axonal projections from their source (the cell body or soma) to their point of termination (the synapse). The complementary technique is "retrograde tracing", which is used to trace neural connections from their termination to their source (i.e. synapse to cell body). Both the anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques are based on the visualization of the biological process of axonal transport.
The anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques allow the detailed descriptions of neuronal projections from a single population of neurons to their various targets throughout the nervous system. These techniques allow the "mapping" of connections between neurons in a particular structure (e.g. the eye) and the target neurons in the brain. Much of what is currently known about connectional neuroanatomy was discovered through the use of the anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques.
Techniques.
Several methods exist to trace projections originating from the soma towards their target areas. These techniques initially relied upon the direct physical injection of various visualizable tracer molecules (e.g. Green fluorescent protein, lipophylic dyes or radioactively tagged amino acids) into the brain. These molecules are absorbed locally by the soma (cell body) of various neurons and transported to the axon terminals, or they are absorbed by axons and transported to the soma of the neuron. Other tracer molecules allow for the visualization of large networks of axonal projections extending from the neurons exposed to the tracer.
The aforementioned tracers such as GFP and DiI are technically not anterograde tracers: they do not selectively travel in a certain direction and are not actively transported by the cell. Furthermore, they do not cross the synaptic cleft, and therefore only label the neurons that were directly at the site of tracer application. These dyes are mostly used as a filler to mark cells that have been recorded using electrophysiology: this allows the cells that have been recorded to also be morphologically reconstructed in 3D.
The anterograde tracers that can cross the synaptic cleft and label multiple neurons within a pathway can be divided in two categories: genetic and molecular tracers.
Genetic tracers.
In order to trace projections from a specific region or cell, a genetic construct, virus or protein can be locally injected, after which it is allowed to be transported anterogradely. Viral tracers can cross the synapse, and can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across many synapses. Examples of viruses used for anterograde tracing are described by Kuypers. Most well known are the Herpes simplex virus type1 (HSV) and the Rhabdoviruses. HSV was used to trace the connections between the brain and the stomach, in order to examine the brain areas involved in viscero-sensory processing. Another study used HSV type1 and type2 to investigate the optical pathway: by injecting the virus into the eye, the pathway from the retina into the brain was visualized. 
Viral tracers use a receptor on the host cell to attach to it and are then endocytosed. For example, HSV uses the nectin receptor and is then endocytosed. After endocytosis, the low pH inside the vesicle strips the envelope of the virion after which the virus is ready to be transported to the cell body. It was shown that pH and endocytosis are crucial for the HSV to infect a cell. Transport of the viral particles along the axon was shown to depend on the microtubular cytoskeleton.
Molecular tracers.
There is also a group of tracers that consist of protein products that can be taken up by the cell and transported across the synapse into the next cell. Wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) and Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin are the most well known tracers, however they are not strict anterograde tracers: especially WGA is known to be transported anterogradely as well as retrogradely. WGA enters the cell by binding to Oligosaccharides,and is then taken up via endocytosis via a caveolae-dependent pathway.
Other anterograde tracers widely used in neuroanatomy are the biotinylated dextran amines (BDA), also used in retrograde labeling.
Partial list of studies using this technique.
The anterograde tracing technique is now a widespread research technique. The following are a partial list of studies that have used anterograde tracing techniques:

Callaway Plantation

The Callaway Plantation is an open air museum featuring several historic houses and other structures that is located in Washington, Georgia, U.S.A. The site was formerly a working plantation, owned by a family named Callaway since at least 1785. In its heyday, the plantation was in size. The museum site is a area containing the main houses that was donated by the family to the city of Washington in the 1980s.
Additional buildings were moved to the site to represent typical plantation buildings. The museum is operated by the Washington-Wilkes Historical Foundation.
The main building is a brick mansion built by the Callaway family around 1860 out of Georgia red clay. It contains no indoor plumbing or electricity, since it was never modernized. Some of the original furniture is in the house.
The family's first home on the plantation was a log cabin built by Job Callaway in 1785. It burned down, but a cabin of similar design from the same era has been moved to the site. 
It consists of one room with a sleeping loft. 
The family's second home still stands on the site, a two-story Federal Plain style house that they built around 1790. 
It features period furnishings and decorations.
Other structures include an 1871 one-room schoolhouse, an 1840 slave cabin, and a 1930 general store, all moved to the site from elsewhere in Georgia. There is also
a corn crib, a house for making bricks, and a smoke house.
The site is located across from the Washington-Wilkes airport, but otherwise appears from photographs to have a pleasant rural flavor.
A small admission fee is charged. Tourist items are sold at the general store, which also serves as the information center.
The buildings feature furniture, tools, and other items characteristic of the old times.

Mangual played one full season, in 1975 with the Expos. In that year he played in 140 games and hit .245 with a .340 on-base percentage. He also stole 33 bases, good for sixth place in the National League that year. 
Midway through the 1976 season, on July 21, Mangual was traded by the Expos along with Jim Dwyer to the Mets for Wayne Garrett and Del Unser. Mangual was acquired to help the Mets in the play-off hunt, but only managed a .186 average the rest of the season. 8 At-bats into the next year Mangual was off the team. He toiled around in the minor leagues for another seven years until 1984 when he called it quits after spending the last seven years in the California Angels organization. Mangual's career minor league numbers were good, a .268 average with a .391 on-base percentage and 161 home runs and 303 stolen bases.

Nathaniel Elwick

Nathaniel Elwick (February 1675–1750) was a British merchant who served as the President of Fort St. George from 15 October 1721 to 15 January 1725.
Early life.
Nathaniel Elwick was born to John Elwick and Judith Crisp. He was baptized on 13 February 1675 and completed his schooling at Merchant Taylor's School in London.
Envoy to China.
As both of his brothers, Thomas Elwick and John Elwick were both Directors of the British East India Company, Nathaniel was sent to China in 1713 as the official envoy.
Governor of Madras.
Two months from the commencement of Elwick's tenure, his predecessor Francis Hastings died. Hastings' "dubash" Mar Kistna was arrested on 8 September 1722 on charges of extortion and non-payment of debts. He was imprisoned in the Fort until 11 December 1722 and released only when he had managed to settle his debts.
The privileged Armenian community of Madras carried out a flourishing trade with the French settlement of Puducherry. However, this trade was forbidden by Elwick and he considered any sort of foreign trade as detrimental to the interests of the British East India Company.
Cheen Kulich Khan, the Nizam of Hyderabad defeated the Nawab of the Carnatic in June 1724 and proceeded towards Gingee causing severe apprehensions among the British authorities in Madras. The same month, the Afghans laid siege to the town of Shiraz in Persia thereby effectively cutting off the supply of Madeira wine to the factory of Madras.

Judo at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's +100 kg

The men's +100 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on 9 September at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium.
This event was the heaviest of the men's judo weight classes, allowing competitors with over 100 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.
A total of eleven judokas competed in the event. A twelfth competitor, Khalil Guerfa of Algeria, was disqualified for failing a pre-match medical exam. He was to have had a bye in the first round followed by a bout against the winner of the Rafael Moreno-Park Jung-min match. Because of Guerfa's disqualification, the winner of the Moreno-Park match instead received a bye into the third round.

Lioré et Olivier LeO H-190

__NOTOC__
The Lioré et Olivier H-190 was a flying boat airliner produced in France in the late 1920s. Conventional for its day, it was a single-bay biplane with unstaggered wings, its single engine mounted tractor-fashion underneath the upper wing and supported on struts in the interplane gap. Early examples had the pilot's open cockpit located aft of the wing, but this was later relocated forward of the wing.
Developed as a passenger transport, versions of the H-190 were also built as catapult-ready mail planes intended to be launched from transatlantic liners, and as coastal patrol aircraft.
The sole LeO H-194 was flown by Marc Bernard together with a CAMS 37 flown by René Guilbaud in a long-distance expeditionary flight across Africa in late 1926. They covered in three months, covering Morocco, Mali, Nigeria, Belgian Congo, Mozambique and Madagascar.

Trinity Episcopal Church (Williamsport, Pennsylvania)

Trinity Episcopal Church is an historic church located in north-central Pennsylvania, at 844 West Fourth Street, Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Built in 1875 and consecrated in February 1876, it is the largest of the Episcopal churches in the city. Preservation Williamsport includes the church on its first trolley tour stop. 
The church structure was given to the parish by Peter Herdic. Trinity Church is currently the Pro-Cathedral of the Diocese of Central Pennsylvania whose Bishop is The Right Reverend Nathan D. Baxter. The current rector of Trinity Parish and provost of the pro-cathedral is The Reverend Canon Kenneth E. Wagner-Pizza.
History of Trinity.
Trinity is an exceptional example of 19th-century ecclesiastical gothic architecture that would not have been possible without the financial backing and vision of two illustrious Williamsport residents, Peter Herdic and Eber Culver. 
Peter Herdic was an entrepreneur and Williamsport mayor in the 1860s and 1870s. Eber Culver designed and oversaw the construction of the 210-foot spire and Fred G. Thorn designed the floor plans for the church.
The cornerstone for the church was laid on Saturday, July 15, 1871. The stone that embraces Trinity’s facade was quarried from Bald Eagle Mountain. Peter Herdic underwrote the cost of the construction, and donated the organ and tower clock at a cost to him of $80,000.
Later, in 1875, Judge Maynard donated the nine-bell chime. The chime mechanism was designed by E. Howard & Co. to sound the Westminster Quarters. According to church records, this was the FIRST tower clock in the United States to sound this chime sequence originally heard in the Tower Clock of the Palace of Westminster in London. The chime clavier was first played on Christmas Eve, 1875. The 9-bell chime combined weight is 8,500 pounds, with the largest bell weighing 2,300 pounds. 
An excerpt from the Parish Dial, March, 1875: "The beautiful instrument, which it contains is from the manufactory of E. Howard & Co., Boston (Serial Number 281.) Several years ago Prof. Lyman, of the Sheffield Scientific School, Yale College, was requested by the city of New Haven to examine the various tower clocks made in this country, and to recommend the instrument which seemed to him the best time keeper. The result of this examination was the purchase of a Howard clock by the city of New Haven, which is now in the tower of the Town Hall and keeps accurate time. The clock in Trinity Church tower is similar to the New Haven instrument, and is warranted, after proper regulation, not to vary over two seconds a week. Extra machinery has been added to the Trinity clock by means of which it strikes the famous Cambridge Quarters, sometimes called the Westminster Quarters. The music for the first quarter consists of four notes, for the second quarter of eight, for the third of twelve, and for the fourth of sixteen. The notes played were arranged by William Crotch from an air of Handel's and were first applied to St. Mary's Cambridge, England in 1794. They are also struck by the clock in the tower of Westminster Palace, and by the Cathedral clock in Toronto, Canada. To Trinity Church belongs the credit of introducing them into the United States. Five of the bells of the Maynard Chime are used in playing these strains, the hour being struck on the great tenor bell."
In 1884, Judge Maynard donated land for the Rectory to be erected.
The Parish Hall and Chapel was constructed and dedicated on May 8, 1916 from a bequest made by Amanda Howard.
On Sunday, February 13, 1977, an arsonist set fire to a pile of hymnals and prayer books in the church chapel. This was the second church fire he had set that evening. The other fire was set at Pine Street United Methodist Church, which could not be saved from the destruction of flames. It was fortunate for Trinity that a neighbor smelled smoke and saw the flames flickering through the chapel windows. The fire department,responded quickly,and contained the damage to the chapel area. The heat from the fire was so intense that it melted the chapel organ pipes.
It was included in the Millionaire's Row Historic District in 1985.
A history of the church "Trinity Episcopal Church - An Historical Portrait" (LC Control No.: 9106682) was written in 1991 and updated and revised in 2010 by Douglas S. Gordon. The original published book is out-of-print but an electronic copy is available from the church office.
The restoration and repointing of the stonework was completed in 2000.
The baptistery mural, "The Angels Appearing to the Shepherds" (1929)(designed by John Wesley Little and completed by S.R. Hartman after Little's death) was restored by Michele W. Mapstone in 2009. 
In 2010, The Pennsylvania College of Technology in cooperation with Mr. James Zerfing rebuilt portions of the clock and put it back in faithful service. Mr. Zerfing has been the caretaker of the clock since the 1970s.
Music at Trinity.
Music is a valued part of Trinity’s heritage. The organ in the main church was built and installed by Austin Organs, Incorporated. It contains 2,031 pipes constituting three manual divisions and pedals arranged in 35 ranks and 2 extensions.
Sunday worship schedule.
Worship services begin at 8:00 AM in the Chapel and 10:00 AM in the Main Church. Telephone: (570) 322-0126 The church is located at 844 West Fourth Street, Williamsport, PA 17701
Community outreach.
In addition to church services, it is home to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, concerts and community events.

The Sturmbrigade Reichsführer-SS was a German military unit of World War II. It was formed in February 1943 when Adolf Hitler ordered the Begleit-Bataillon Reichsführer-SS (Heinrich Himmler's escort battalion), which had proved itself in battle, be upgraded to the status of an assault brigade or Sturmbrigade thus Sturmbrigade Reichsführer SS was established. 
It was upgraded in France and remained stationed there until the invasion of Italy in September 1943 when it was sent south with the 505. Artillerie Bataillon (sf).
The brigade was stationed in Corsica where it served as part of the garrison until 8 September 1943, when heavy fighting broke out on the island between the Sturmbrigade and the Italian 20th Infantry Division "Friuli" and 44th Infantry Division "Cremona". Along with the 90th Panzergrenadier Division coming from Sardinia the brigade broke through to Bastia in Northern Corsica, from where the German units were evacuated in the first days of October 1943. Afterwards the brigade was sent to Italy and reorganized into the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS.

Huelga De Hambre

Huelga de Hambre (shortened as HDH)is a Peruvian band, formed in Lima, Peru, around April 1994. They started to play covers from Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Black Crowes and Soul Asylum. And released their only album, "M4QUINA Y ESPIR1TU" (), in 1998.
Huelga de Hambre quickly developed a distinctive quality sound with clear resemblance of their grunge influences. It has been coined as the best "reincarnation" of the Seattle scene in Peru.
Even though the band was not widely known in the US market, it was the most salient representative of grunge music in Peru, and probably South America. They played in international venues as the PULULAHUA '99 on the same stage as with acclaimed bands like Aterciopelados and La Ley. And they also play two concerts in the US promoting their first CD in 2000. They are considered by many as the best Peruvian band of the 90's. They did win the first place in IV Concurso de Música Moderna () held in Lima in 1995, which certainly put them under the spotlight in the Peruvian rock scene.
They separated in 2000 and some of them gave birth to Zen and Theremyn 4.
Origin of the Band's Name.
The name of the band, Huelga de Hambre, is Spanish for Hunger Strike, which is the most significant single by the band Temple of the Dog.
Temple of the Dog was formed by future members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, which comprises the most of Huelga de Hambre influences.
Reunion.

Third Precinct Police Station

The Third Precinct Police Station (or Hunt Street Station) is a former police station located at 2200 Hunt Street (at Gratiot Avenue) in Detroit, Michigan. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
Description.
The Third Precinct Police Station is a three-story structure built from yellow brick and limestone. It is essentially boxy, but the exterior is constructed of projecting and receding planes that disguise the fact. The entrance, located in a curved corner bay, is flanked by limestone columns and pilasters with carvings of a police shield and the faces of policemen. The second and third floor windows facing Hunt and Dubois are unified by arched guilloche-patterned, terra-cotta enframements. Third-floor windows are topped by arched hoods. The projecting cornice is metal, fabricated by the Detroit Cornice and Slate Company.
Significance.
The Hunt Street Police Station is a well-preserved example of a late 19th-century Beaux-Arts public building, and is significant for its role in the history of the Detroit police force. In 1959, the Third and Seventh Precincts were consolidated and the building was sold; subsequently used as an office space, the structure was left empty in 2004 and is currently for sale.

Johann Spies

Johann Spies (ca. 1540-1623) was a German printer who published an anonymous book of tales about a legendary Doctor Faust who made a pact with the Devil. The story became the basis for several notable literary works, including Marlowe's "Tragedy of Doctor Faustus" and Goethe's "Faust". 
Spies published the book in 1587 in Frankfurt am Main under the title "Historia von D. Johann Fausten". The book is a compendium of anecdotes about a professor of theology and medicine who undertakes the study of sorcery, forms an alliance with the Devil (in the form of a friar named Mephistopheles), and undergoes a series of fantastic adventures. In the end, Faust is punished for his sins when Satan torments him and takes his soul to hell. 
Within a year the book was translated into English, and by 1611 it had also appeared in French, Dutch, and Czech.

You Were Never Duckier

You Were Never Duckier is an animated cartoon in the "Merrie Melodies" series from 1948. Starring Daffy Duck and Henery Hawk, this cartoon marked the start of a direction change for Daffy Duck, from a "screwball" character, to a greedy, self-centered one (though, according to commentary by Eric Goldberg on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD volume, this cartoon showed Daffy as being "both" a greedy, self-centered character "and" a screwball one). This cartoon was also the next-to-last Henery Hawk cartoon to "not" be directed by Robert McKimson, and one of only three to be directed by creator Chuck Jones (after "The Squawkin' Hawk", and followed by "The Scarlet Pumpernickel").
The title is a play on the title song in the 1942 musical film "You Were Never Lovelier" starring Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth, with music and lyrics by Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer. 
Plot.
The National Poultry Show is being held, and Daffy Duck looks at the matinee showing the prizes for the judging. The first prize for best rooster is $5000 (equal to $ today), and the best duck is $5 (equal to $ today). Daffy, having traveled all the way from Dubuque for the contest, is outraged that ducks rate such a low prize and decides to disguise himself as a rooster (using rubber gloves and the tail feathers of another rooster) to get $5000. Meanwhile, Henery is being taught all about roosters by his father, George K. (or G.K.) Chickenhawk (a reference to G.K. Chesterton. Henery decides to head to the poultry show and catch himself a rooster.
Daffy's plan backfires when Henery decides to take him home. Daffy says he's a special breed of rooster, and thinking that Henery's father, described as "the greatest judge of chicken flesh in the world," is the judge to give him the $5000, he tags along. Daffy then finds out he is in a chickenhawk's house, and tries to escape, but fails. Henery's father then starts to prepare Daffy as a meal. Daffy tries to prove he is really a duck, even trying to take his disguise off (to no avail). When he tries to escape, Henery's father grabs his "head" (the rubber glove), and the glove lands on "his" head, then he proceeds to chase Daffy, who is finally able to escape when Henery accidentally hits his father with a mallet.
Before the contest begins, Daffy puts on another glove. Then, at the contest, Daffy loses to Henery's father, disguised as a Rhode Island red. Daffy then tries for the best duck prize, but loses that as well - to Henery, wearing a disguise consisting of a clothespin and two flippers.

Louis, Count of Vaudémont

Louis de Lorraine (27 April 1500 – 23 August 1528) was a nobleman of Lorraine who attempted to claim the Kingdom of Naples. He was styled as the Count of Vaudémont.
A younger son of René II, Duke of Lorraine, he was born in Bar-le-Duc in 1500. His family possessed a hereditary claim to the throne of Naples, and his father had accepted the throne of Naples in 1493. However, the ambitions of Charles VIII towards the same object prevented René from taking up rule in Italy. Upon his death in 1508, Louis' older brother Antoine reverted to the style of Duke of Calabria to indicate his family's claims on Naples.
Originally destined for the Church and styled Prince de l'Eglise, he became Bishop of Verdun in 1508 and Abbot of Saint-Mihiel in 1512. He was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. He abandoned his ecclesiastical career in 1522, taking the title of Count of Vaudémont.
Louis was present with the army led by Francis I into Italy in 1524, and fought at the Battle of Pavia. With the outbreak of the War of the League of Cognac, Louis was sent into Italy with an army under the command of Lautrec, and was invested by Pope Clement VII as King of Naples and Sicily. Salerno fell to the invaders on 17 March 1527, but the siege of Naples by the French army was prolonged and unsuccessful. When plague broke out in the encampment, both Lautrec and Vaudémont succumbed.

United States elections, 2002

The 2002 United States general elections were held on November 5, two years after Republican President George W. Bush won the 2000 Presidential election. Unusual in midterm elections, the incumbent president's party gained seats in both chambers of the United States Congress. The Republicans picked up net gains of 2 Senate seats and 8 House seats.
These elections were held just a little under fourteen months after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Thus the elections were heavily overshadowed by the war on terror, the impending war with Iraq, and the sudden death of Democratic Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone about one week before the election.
Federal elections.
United States congressional elections.
Despite being the incumbent party in the White House, which is usually a disadvantage for the President's party during midterm Congressional elections, Republicans achieved gains in both chambers of the United States Congress.
United States Senate elections.
During the 2002 U.S. Senate elections, all thirty-three regularly scheduled Class II Senate seats as well as a special election in Missouri were held.
In the United States Senate elections, the Republican Party achieved an overall net gain of two seats with victories in Georgia, Minnesota, and Missouri while the Democrats took a seat in Arkansas. Thus, the balance of power in the Senate changed from 51-49 Democratic Majority to 51-49 Republican Majority.
United States House of Representatives elections.
During the 2002 House elections, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives plus five of the six non-voting Delegates from non-state districts were up for election that year. These elections were the first to be held following redistricting in apportionment according to the 2000 United States Census.
Republicans succeeded in expanding their majority in the House of Representatives by a net gain of eight, resulting in an 229-204 (excluding Delegates) Republican majority.
In addition to all regularly scheduled House elections, there were two special elections held, one for Oklahoma's 1st congressional district on January 8 and another for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district on November 30.
State elections.
Gubernatorial elections.
During the 2002 gubernatorial elections, the governorships of the thirty-six states, two territories, and the District of Columbia were up for election.
Going into the elections, Republicans held the governorships of twenty-seven states and one territory (that being the Northern Mariana Islands), Democrats held those of twenty-one states, four territories, and the Mayorship of the District of Columbia, and two governorships were held by incumbents of neither party (those being Angus King (I-ME) and Jesse Ventura (MIP-MN)). Following the elections, Republicans sustained a net loss of one state governorship (but did gain the governorship of the territory of Guam), Democrats gained an overall net gain of three state governorships and held on to all other territorial governorships and the Mayorship of the District of Columbia, and there would be no governorships held by Independents or third parties. Thus the balance of power (excluding non-state entities) would be changed from 27-21 Republican majority to 26-24 Republican Majority.
Other state-wide Officer elections.
In some states where the positions were elective offices, voters elected candidates for state executive branch offices (Lieutenant Governors (though some were elected on the same ticket as the gubernatorial nominee), Secretary of state, state Treasurer, state Auditor, state Attorney General, state Superintendent of Education, Commissioners of Insurance, Agriculture or, Labor, and etc.) and state judicial branch offices (seats on state Supreme Courts and, in some states, state appellate courts).
State legislative elections.
In 2002, the seats of the Legislatures of forty-six states and five non-state entities were up for election.
Republicans captured eight legislative chambers from Democrats and also won the majority of state legislative seats for the first time in half a century.
Local elections.
Nationwide, there were some cities, counties, school boards, special districts and others that elected members in 2002.
Mayoral elections.
During 2002, some major American cities held their mayoral elections that year, the most notable being the Washington, D.C. mayoral election.

ICU quality and management tools

The intensive care unit (ICU) is one of the major components of the current health care system. The advances in supportive care and monitoring resulted in significant improvements in the care of surgical and clinical patients. Nowadays aggressive surgical therapies as well as transplantation are made safer by the monitoring in a closed environment, the surgical ICU, in the post-operative period. Moreover, the care and full recovery of many severely ill clinical patients as those with life-threatening infections occurs as a result of intensive care.
However, despite many significant advances in various fields as mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, antimicrobial therapy and hemodynamic monitoring this increased knowledge and the wise use of such technology is not available for all patients. Shortage of ICU beds are an important issue, however even when ICU beds are available significant variability in treatment and in the adherence to evidence-based interventions do not occur.
Tools for ICU quality monitoring.
Several measures of ICU performance have been proposed in the past 30 years. It is intuitive, and correct, to assume that ICU mortality may be a useful marker of quality. However, crude mortality rates does not take into consideration the singular aspects of each specific patient population that is treated in a certain geographic region, hospital or ICU. Therefore approaches looking for standardized mortality ratios that are adjusted for disease severity, comorbidities and other clinical aspects are often sought. Severity of illness is usually evaluated by scoring systems that integrates clinical, physiologic and demographic variables. Scoring systems are interesting tools to describe ICU populations and explain their different outcomes. The most frequently used are the APACHE II, SAPS II and MPM. However, newer scores as APACHE IV and SAPS III have been recently introduced in clinical practice. More than only using scoring systems, one should search for a high rate of adherence to clinically effective interventions. Adherence to interventions as deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, reduction of ICU-acquired infections, adequate sedation regimens and decreasing and reporting serious adverse events are essential and have been accepted as benchmarking of quality. 
The complex task of collecting and analyzing data on performance measures are made easier when clinical information systems are available. Although several clinical information systems focus on important aspects as computerized physician order entry systems and individual patient tracking information, few have attempted to gather clinical information generating full reports that provide a panorama of the ICU performance and detailed data on several domains as mortality, length of stay, severity of illness, clinical scores, nosocomial infections, adverse events and adherence to good clinical practice. Through implementing quality initiatives, increasing the quality of care and patient safety are major and feasible goals. Such systems (for example: Epimed Monitor) are available for clinical use and may facilitate the process of care on a daily basis and provide data for an in-depth analysis of ICU performance.

It was recorded in Perth, Western Australia, co-produced by Magoo (Midnight Oil, Powderfinger, Regurgitator) and Andy Lawson (Little Birdy), mixed by Tim Palmer (U2, The Cure, Robert Plant) in Los Angeles and mastered by Stephen Marcussen (R.E.M., Rolling Stones, Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty).
Background.
Bass player Tom King explained that Magoo provided the inspiration for the album's title: "It started off with Magoo keeping a journal in the studio, which we dubbed 'the book of lies'. "
In an interview with Xpress Magazine, lead singer Justin Burford explained:
The biggest point of difference between the first record and this one is the time we took preparing. The preparation time for the first album was like, a couple of years on the road. So we were basically like a garage pop band who went into a studio. Dennis didn't really give us the chance to develop or grow beyond that. It was like what we knew went onto the record. This time it was... like an exam. We studied way harder; just the preparation was far more intense. Once we had a pretty good idea of what everything was going to sound like, we didn't need much time in the studio, because we had spent six months working on the demos.
Singles.
The video for the band's first single, "Fussy", was directed by Natasha Pincus, who also directed the award-winning video for Paul Kelly's "God Told Me To". The video sees Burford as the demented killer and his bandmates as the cling-wrapped victims.
The single was released at the end of August 2008 and peaked at number 47 on the ARIA singles charts.
The second single, "Dying for You", was co-written by Burford with Julian Hamilton of The Presets.
